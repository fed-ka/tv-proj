      INT. WATTS HOME - STAIRWELL - DAY

      A model spaceship floats upwards in a stairwell, held aloft 
      by the hand of an otherwise unseen BOY.

      The BOY makes the sounds of the thrusters as he goes.

      Close to the top, he hears a WOMAN RETCHING.

      INT. WATTS HOME - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY

      MOLLY WATTS (late 30's), is on her knees in her pj's, 
      throwing up in the toilet.

      After a final violent heave, she drags herself up to the 
      bathroom sink and splashes water over her face.

      She studies her puffy, bloodshot eyes.

                                  ETHAN (OS)
                    Mom?

      She turns to see her son, ETHAN (10) standing in the doorway, 
      dressed up and holding the model spaceship.

      His presence makes her uncomfortable.

                                  MOLLY
                    I'm fine.

      He stands there for a moment, just watching her.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    It's just my body readjusting. I'm 
                    ok, I promise.

                                  ETHAN
                    Dad said everyone will be here, 
                    soon.

                                  MOLLY
                    I'll be right down.

      He turns and leaves the room.

      Molly slides a finger over the bathroom mirror and a news 
      broadcast plays in a sort of hologram in the mirror. A logo 
      for a company called Verdisign glows in the corner.

      Molly brushes her teeth as it plays.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      2.

      CONTINUED:

      Through the crack of the door, Ethan watches her.

      EXT. WATTS HOME - BACKYARD - DAY

      A celebratory cookout is in full swing.  There are streamers 
      that say "WELCOME HOME", lots of balloons, and TWO DOZEN 
      FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS of all ages and sizes.

      JOHN WATTS (late 30's) mans the grill and chats away with his 
      GUY FRIENDS. John's a handsome academic.

      Ethan plays wiffle ball with some KIDS in the yard.

      Molly holds court with her GIRLFRIENDS, including SAM (late 
      and BETS (40's).

                                  BETS
                    I can't imagine. I'm away from Karl 
                    and the kids for two days, it's 
                    like...

                                  MOLLY
                    I know.

                                  BETS
                    I don't know how you did it.

                                  MOLLY
                    A lot of video conferencing.

                                  BETS
                    And no alcohol?

                                  MOLLY
                    I haven't had a drink in thirteen 
                    months.

                                  BETS
                    Ok, that's like the saddest story 
                    I've ever heard!  We have to remedy 
                    that right now.

                                  MOLLY
                    Can't.

                                  BETS
                    No can'ts, we're doing shots.

                                  MOLLY
                    Doctor's orders...





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      3.

      CONTINUED:

                                  BETS
                          (to Sam)
                    Come on, doctor.

                                  SAM
                      Absolutely not.

                                  BETS
                    One shot.

                                  SAM
                    No alcohol until tomorrow, until we 
                    run her tests.  After that, I'll 
                      personally write her a prescription 
                    to get shitfaced.

      The Girls laugh.  Molly glances over and catches John 
      watching her.  He gives her a wink and she smiles at him.

      Across the yard, a commotion breaks out.  Molly looks that 
      way just in time to see Ethan shove a SMALL KID down.

                                  JOHN
                    Ethan!

      John and Molly rush to where Ethan stands over the Kid.

      John grabs Ethan by the arm, Molly helps the Kid up as his 
      PARENTS arrive.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?

                                  ETHAN
                    He wouldn't give me the ball.

                                  JOHN
                    And, your solution was to push him?

      Ethan stares at the ground.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    What do you say?  Ethan.

      Ethan looks at the kid and holds out the ball.

                                  ETHAN
                    I'm sorry.

      The Kid takes the ball and the standoff eases.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      4.

      CONTINUED: (2)

                                  JOHN
                    If you do it again, that's it, 
                    that's the end of the party for 
                    you.  You'll be grounded.  Do you 
                      understand?

      Ethan nods.  John walks away with the parents.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    I'm so sorry.  I think we're just 
                    having a little trouble with the 
                      transition...

      Molly looks back at the kids.  Ethan looks at her and Molly 
      forces a small smile for him.  He returns the smile and goes 
      back to playing.

      INT. WATTS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Molly cleans up the aftermath of the party.  Plates of half-
      eaten cake.  Empty cups and bottles.

      Ethan is asleep on the couch, cradling the toy spaceship.  On 
      the wall over the couch is a framed photo.

      Molly, John and Ethan.  A smiling, happy family.  Molly wears 
      a spacesuit with an I.S.E.A. logo.  (International Space 
      Exploration Administration)

      She studies the picture, then the sleeping boy underneath.

      INT. WATTS HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      John puts the dishes away in a dishwasher.  Molly brings in 
      an armload.

                                  JOHN
                    You've gotta be exhausted, go on 
                    up.

                                  MOLLY
                    Let me at least take out the trash.

                                  JOHN
                    I've got it.

                                  MOLLY
                    Too late, sorry.

      She's already out the back door with a bag.                                                                                      5.


      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

      Molly rounds the corner with the garbage and is startled to 
      find a MAN standing in the shadows.  On seeing her, he turns 
      casually and walks the other way.

      She's unnerved but she holds her ground and tosses the trash 
      into a metal bin.  She slides her finger over the bin and an 
      LED readout begins to analyze and process the trash.

      The Verdisign logo is seen on the bin.

      Molly watches the Man reach the other end of the alley before 
      she turns back to the house.

      INT. WATTS HOME - ETHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      There's a moon lamp on the night table, next to a small, gray 
      box.  John tucks a sleepy-eyed Ethan in his bed.

                                  ETHAN
                    I was angry.

                                  JOHN
                    Is that what you're supposed to do 
                    when you get angry?  Hurt someone?

                                  ETHAN
                    No.

                                  JOHN
                    How do you think you would have 
                    felt if you'd really hurt that kid?

                                  ETHAN
                    Bad.

                                  JOHN
                    I sure hope so.

                                  ETHAN
                    Mom's mad at me.

                                  JOHN
                    She's not mad.

                                  ETHAN
                    It's different, now. With her.

                                  JOHN
                    Your mom has to get used to being 
                    back home.  She was up there a long 
                    time, all by herself.  
                                  (MORE)


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      6.

      CONTINUED:
                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    It's going to take awhile for 
                      everything to feel normal, again.  
                    But, it will.  I promise.

                                  ETHAN
                    Ok.

                                  JOHN
                    Get a good night's sleep, we have a 
                    big day tomorrow.

                                  ETHAN
                    I think I need a flip.

                                  JOHN
                    Yeah?  Let me see.

      Ethan rolls over on his side.  John raises Ethan's shirt and 
      reveals a SMALL PANEL on the small of his back.

      John slides a finger across the panel.  It opens up and John 
      pops out a small cylinder with a blinking orange light.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    You're right.

      John opens the gray box where there are four similar 
      cylinders, all glowing solid green.  He swaps the orange one 
      out for one of the green and snaps it back in the panel.

      He slides his finger again and the panel closes.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    All set.  I love you.

                                  ETHAN
                    I love you, too.  Will you leave my 
                    night light on?

                                  JOHN
                    Sure.

      John heads to the door.  On the way out, he touches a control 
      panel by the door. 

      The lights go out and a glowing constellation appears on the 
      ceiling, stars blinking peacefully in the dark.

      INT. WATTS HOME - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

      Molly is in the shower.  John enters the bathroom and takes 
      off his clothes.  He opens the door and joins her.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      7.

      CONTINUED:

      She puts her arms around him.  For awhile, they just cling to 
      each other under the water.  Then slowly begin to kiss.

      INT. WATTS HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

      John is fast asleep.  Molly stares at the ceiling.

      Quietly, she slips out of bed and out of the room.

      INT. WATTS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Molly moves through the darkness, to a bookcase.

      She scans her eyes over the rows of books until she finds 
      what she's looking for.  A large yearbook.

      INT. WATTS HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

      Molly sits alone at the table.  She flips through the pages 
      of the yearbook.

      She stops on a full page picture of a handsome, smiling young 
      man.  At the top of the page, the words IN MEMORIAM.  At the 
      bottom, the young man's name, MARCUS RAWLINS, and a short 
      poem.

      Molly stares at the face.

                                  JOHN (OS)
                    What brought this on?

      Molly seems jolted out of a trance.  She whips around to see 
      John standing behind her.  He slides into a seat.

                                  MOLLY
                    Just a dream.

                                  JOHN
                    Do you dream about him often?

                                  MOLLY
                    Less as I get older.

                                  JOHN
                    Me, too.

                                  MOLLY
                    You didn't even know him.







                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      8.

      CONTINUED:

                                  JOHN
                    No, but I still think about him.  I 
                    think about how if he hadn't passed 
                    away, then maybe you and I never 
                    would have met.  You would have 
                    gone off to college together.  
                    Probably got married, maybe you 
                    would have had kids.  There would 
                    be no us.  No Ethan.  He's a part 
                    of my life.

                                  MOLLY
                    I think we always end up where 
                    we're supposed to.

      He takes her hands in his and covers them in kisses.

      EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

      A coastal city in Florida.

      A good portion of the skyline's architecture is made up of 
      streamlined buildings of glass and steel.  Lots of light and 
      air and green space, both literally and figuratively.

      INT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY

      John and Ethan sit facing each other as the car drives 
      itself.  Music plays over the sound system.

      Ethan plays a portable video game as John flips through a 
        presentation on a tablet device.

      The report is about Ethan.  Schematics, early sketches, 
      colored renderings and more in his likeness.  He comes across 
      a final rendering that looks just like the boy sitting across 
      from him, the one engrossed in his game.

      John looks at him with pride.

                    South gate.

                                  FEMALE VOICE (VO)
                      Approaching South gate.                                                                                      9.


      EXT. MATSUMO TOWER - DAY

      The car turns into the gated entrance of a black glass 
      monolith that stretches into the heavens.

      INT. MATSUMO TOWER - DAY

      John and Ethan wait in an open, airy lobby.  CORPORATE DRONES 
      swirl about, glued to communication devices.

      John bends down to tie Ethan's shoe.

                                  JOHN
                    Listen, buddy...hey...

      He pulls the video game from Ethan to get his attention.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    When I talk about you today, I'm 
                    going to have to talk about the way 
                    you were created for the Humanichs 
                    project.

                                  ETHAN
                    I know.

                                  JOHN
                    I just don't want you to think that 
                    it means I don't see you as real.

                                  ETHAN
                    I'm not real.

                                  JOHN
                    You are real.  You exist.

                                  ETHAN
                    I'm not human.

                                  JOHN
                    You're better than human.

                                  ETHAN
                    Because I'm the prototype?

                                  JOHN
                    Because you're my son.

      INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

      Molly sits on the examining table in Sam's office.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

      CONTINUED:

      She's tense and fidgety.  She passes the time by looking at 
      Sam's accreditations on the walls.  Diplomas and 
      certifications from the I.S.E.A.

      The door opens and Sam enters in her lab coat, carrying a 
      folder.  She doesn't look Molly in the eye, but sits across 
      from her, stunned.

                                  MOLLY
                    What's going on?

                                  SAM
                    I don't even know where to begin.

                                  MOLLY
                    What is it?  Tell me.

                                  SAM
                    You were on the Seraph station for 
                    thirteen months.

                                  MOLLY
                    Yes.

                                  SAM
                    All by yourself?  There was never 
                    anyone else on board?

                                  MOLLY
                    It was a solo mission.  You know 
                    that.

                                  SAM
                    There was no international crew 
                    that docked for an emergency, 
                    something we may not have heard 
                    about here?  Some...

      Sam keeps talking, but Molly drifts off and fixates on a 
      white spot on the wall.

      INT. SERAPH SPACE STATION - TERRARIUM - NIGHT

      Ten months ago.

      A small space station, built for deep space research and 
      scientific study.

      Molly digs a trowel into a small pot of black soil and gently 
      digs up a worm.  She looks it over, closely.

      A synthesized voice cuts in.  This is BEN, the station's 
      control system.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

                    Go ahead.

                                  BEN (VO)
                    You have an incoming com-link 
                    request.  Shall I patch it through?

                    Send to Bay 1, please.

      She approaches a holographic computer screen and swipes her 
      fingers over the sensors. 

      The screen comes to life with an image of John and Ethan.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    Hey, guys!

                                  JOHN
                    There's your mom, say hello.  Can 
                    you see her?

                                  ETHAN
                    Hello.

                                  MOLLY
                    How's it going?

                                  JOHN
                    You want to tell her?

                                  ETHAN
                    I got all A's on my report card.

                                  MOLLY
                    Yay!  That's so great, 
                      congratulations!

                                  JOHN
                    Show her the, no, hold up your...

      The screen blips a couple of times and then it goes black.

                                  MOLLY
                    Ben?

                                  BEN (VO)
                    I'm detecting interference from a 
                    solar flare.  Shall I attempt to 
                    reconnect after it passes?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    12.

      CONTINUED: (2)

                                  MOLLY
                    Sure, thank you.

      She goes back to the trowel.

      The lights blink, and the station loses power.  A few moments 
      later, emergency lights flicker on.

      Molly stops working and looks around.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    Ben?

      No answer.  She goes to a wall panel of controls and brings 
      up a holographic screen.

      She enters a series of commands to reboot the B.E.N. system.

      There's a CLANG from the other side of a nearby pod door.

      Molly looks that way.  There's a small portal window and she 
      takes a step towards it.

      A shadow flickers across the window and it stops Molly in her 
      tracks.

      Panicked, she rushes back to the control panel and punches in 
      a command for EMERGENCY LOCKDOWN - ALL BAY DOORS.

      She hears the HISS of the airlocks.  She gets her breath.

      She takes a tiny step towards the door.  And, another.  And, 
      another.  Terrified.

      Molly gets to the portal window and looks through it.

      On the other side, she sees the figure of a man standing 
      there.  He raises his head slowly and she discovers that it 
      is MARCUS RAWLINS, the young man from her yearbook.

      Molly is stunned, stopped cold in her tracks.

      INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

      Molly snaps back to Sam, who is staring at her.

                                  SAM
                    Molly.  Did you hear what I just

      She shakes her head, yes.

                                  MOLLY
                    How long?

                                  SAM
                    Two months.  Somehow, it was 
                    conceived on the Seraph.

                                  MOLLY
                    That's impossible.

                                  SAM
                    I'm sorry, but I have to ask.  Are 
                    you sure there was no one else...

                                  MOLLY
                    Yes.  And, even if there was 
                    someone else, you know my 
                      situation.

                                  SAM
                    Were you still taking the fertility 
                    drugs?

                                  MOLLY
                    No.  I stopped them a long time 
                    ago, before Ethan.

                                  SAM
                    You didn't artificially inseminate

                    Yes, and your health could be in 
                    danger.  We should be running more 
                    tests on you right now.

                    That's exactly what I don't want to 
                    happen.  You know what they'll do 
                    if the agency finds out.  Sam, I 
                    just got back to my family. Please.  
                    All I'm asking you to do is delay 
                    it for a day or two.

      Sam thinks it over.

      INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

      John stands on a stage in front of the board of Matsumo Corp, 
      various BUSINESS and ACADEMIC types in the dark.

                    The Humanichs project is not about 
                    creating lifelike robots.  We've 
                    been building those kinds of 
                    androids for decades now.  We've 
                    made incredible leaps in robotic 
                      engineering, artificial 
                      intelligence, synthetic tissues and 
                    organs.  But, we have yet to build 
                    a bridge across the uncanny valley.  
                    Humanichs is not about the latest

                    still have an inability to conceive 
                    children. It's about making a 
                    miracle manifest for people like me 
                    and my wife.  We were told we would 
                    never be parents.  That it was 
                      impossible.  But, this is the age 
                    of Matsumo Corp, and nothing is 
                      impossible.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
                    I'd like to introduce you to my 
                    son.  Ethan.

      He gestures and Ethan steps out from backstage.  He hops up 
      on a stool near John and gives a small, shy wave.

      There is some chuckling from the board and warm waves back to 
      him.  John ruffles his hair, the proud papa.

      EXT. THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE EXPLORATION AGENCY - DAY

      A state of the art admin building glistens in the sun.

      INT. ISEA HALLWAY - DAY

      Molly paces the floor.

      Deputy Director STEPHEN KERN approaches.  Early 40's, 
      military haircut and countenance.  Plain dark suit.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

                    Doctor Watts.  Stephen Kern.

                                  MOLLY
                    The new Deputy Director.

                                  KERN
                    That would be me.  Pleasure to meet 
                    you in person, finally.

      He fingerprint scans their way through a nearby door.

      INT. ISEA CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

      Kern and Molly sit across a large table.  He scans through a 
      file on a tablet type device.

                                  KERN
                    I have to be honest.  I spent the 
                    whole weekend preparing to grill 
                    you on these logs but your work is 
                      incredibly thorough.  There's very 
                    little left to the imagination.

                                  MOLLY
                    That's sort of the mixed blessing 
                    of a solo mission.  The good news 
                    is, you have plenty of time for 
                    data entry.  The bad news is...

                                  BOTH
                    You have plenty of time for data 
                    entry.

                                  KERN
                    There was one thing...

      His phone buzzes.  He checks it out.

                                  KERN (CONT D)
                    Director Sparks, he'll be down in a 
                    moment.  There was an incident...

                                  MOLLY
                    The gap.

                                  KERN
                    The gap, yes.

                                  MOLLY
                    Well, it's easily...




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

                                  KERN
                    If you don't mind, we'll wait for 
                    the director for that.  He has 
                      questions.

                                  MOLLY
                    Of course.

      Kern flips through the logs while Molly waits.

      INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

      SEGERS, a banker type in his fifties, questions John.

                                  SEGERS
                    There's something I'm sure everyone 
                    in this room is curious about, but 
                    we're all either too polite or too 
                      embarrassed to ask.

                                  JOHN
                    The robot uprising.  Am I right?

      More chuckles.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    What's to stop the Humanichs from 
                      overthrowing us one day and 
                    enslaving their human overlords? Is 
                    that the question?

      He looks at Ethan.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    They're on to you, buddy.

      Ethan shrugs.  More laughter.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    All joking aside, there is a 
                    serious answer.  And, that answer 
                      is...absolutely nothing.

      The laughter dies down.

                                  SEGERS
                    How then would an owner control and 
                    manage their behavior?

                                  JOHN
                    They wouldn't.  And, they wouldn't 
                    own them, it's not a master-slave 
                      relationship.

                    These are like children. The 
                    Humanichs are designed to learn the 
                    same way a child learns.  The brain 
                    takes in a certain amount of 
                      information in any given 
                      circumstance.  It reads the 
                    responses of the people involved in 
                    that situation and it processes 
                    actions and consequences.  It 
                      recalibrates and adapts.  It learns 
                    right from wrong and good from bad, 
                    the same way we all did.  For the 
                    most part.

                                  SEGERS
                    What do you mean, for the most

                                  JOHN
                    Let's say you have two sons.  You 
                    raise them both exactly the same.  
                    One grows up to be a doctor, the 
                    other grows up to be a mass 
                    murderer.  There are always outside 
                    forces and things that are beyond a 
                    parent's control.  There is no 
                    guarantee with any human child, 
                    because in the end, they're free to 
                    choose their own path.  My goal is 
                    to replicate that same experience 
                    with the Humanichs.  To give them 
                    what I've given to Ethan.

                    Forgive me, Doctor Watts, I don't 
                    mean to be crude or insensitive, 
                    but I believe there's a bottom line 
                    question here.  What is the 
                    protocol in the event your 
                      experiment fails and one of your 
                    creations does go bad?

                                  JOHN

                    That wording might be a bit 
                      inelegant, but yes.

                                  JOHN
                    Do you have a child?

                    My daughter is a human being, 
                    Doctor Watts.  There's a 
                      difference.

                                  JOHN
                    What's the difference?

                                  MS. DODD
                    Well, for starters, she has a soul.

                                  JOHN
                    With all due respect, Ms. Dodd, 
                    there's no such thing as a soul.

      There's a bit of audible reaction from the dark.  Ethan takes 
      it all in, watching his dad at work.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    What you call a soul I call the 
                      cumulative effect of a lifetime of 
                      experience.  It's simple 
                      information, traveling in the 
                      neuropathways in your daughter's 
                    brain.  In that respect, there is 
                    no difference.

                                  MS. DODD
                    I think many people would disagree.

      INT. ISEA CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

      Molly and Kern have been joined by DIRECTOR ALVIN SPARKS, 
      Same look as Kern but a little softened by age.

                                  MOLLY
                    The gap was caused by activity from 
                    a solar flare.  I was on a com-link 
                    session with my family when it hit.  
                    The station's power went out 
                      completely for a few moments.  
                    Then, the emergency backup kicked 
                    in.  The security and life support 
                    systems were back online almost 
                      immediately, but the communication 
                    system stayed down for 
                      approximately thirteen hours.  As 
                    it says in the log, I spent most of 
                    the night trying to get it up and 
                    running again, but I was 
                      unsuccessful.  I fell asleep for 
                    three hours, and when I woke up, 
                      everything was back to normal.

                                  SPARKS
                    So, for ten straight hours, you 
                    were performing maintenance work on 
                    Ben.

                                  MOLLY
                    That is correct.

                                  SPARKS
                    During that time, did anything 
                    unusual occur?

                                  MOLLY
                    Unusual.

                                  SPARKS
                    Yes.  Perhaps related to the solar 
                    flare.  Anything you forgot to put 
                    in the logs but have since 
                    recalled?

      Molly thinks it over.                                                                                    22.


      INT. SERAPH SPACE STATION - TERRARIUM - NIGHT

      Molly stares are the portal, stunned.

      Marcus, on the other side, puts his fingers up to the glass.  
      Molly studies his fingertips.

      She brings her face closer.

      He brings his face closer and exhales on the glass, causing a 
      cloud of condensation.  He takes a finger and begins to spell 
      out something.

      Molly watches the words form on the glass.  The message says, 
      "HELP ME".

      INT. ISEA CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

                                  MOLLY
                    It's all in the logbook.

                                  KERN
                    There's one more thing I'm not a 
                    hundred per cent clear on.  The 
                    security system records each 
                    quadrant of the Seraph station with 
                    a bank of surveillance cameras. 
                      Presumably, they were up and 
                    running again as soon as the 
                    emergency power kicked on, but that 
                    footage has been deleted from the 
                    system's memory.

                                  MOLLY
                    I'm afraid that's a classic case of 
                    H.O.E., sir.

                                  KERN
                    I'm not familiar with that code.

                          (smiling)
                    Human operator error.

                                  MOLLY
                      I accidentally deleted the footage 
                    while trying to assess the system's 
                      functionality after the solar 
                    flares.  The only record that 
                    exists of that time is the manual 
                    record I entered in the log.  I 
                    take full responsibility for that 
                    error.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.

                    I'm still waiting on your medical 
                      examinations.  Once I'm able to

                    series of psychiatric evaluations, 
                    we'll be able to put this one in

                      Psychiatric evaluations?

                                  SPARKS
                    There's been a change in agency 
                    policy, after what happened to your 
                      colleague, Doctor Coulter.

                                  MOLLY
                    I wasn't aware of this change.

                                  SPARKS
                    I'm making you aware, now.  Do you 
                    have an objection?

                                  MOLLY
                    Not at all.

      Sparks gives a nod and walks away.

      INT. WATTS HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      John and Ethan sit in the living room, putting together an 
      elaborate model of a spaceship.  As each piece clicks into 
      place, a new graphic appears.

      Ethan puts in a piece.  John watches him, and then snaps in a 
      piece himself.

                                  JOHN
                    What do think about today?

                                  ETHAN
                    I don't understand the question.

                                  JOHN
                    How did the presentation make you 
                    feel?

                                  ETHAN
                    That they wouldn't listen to you.

                                  JOHN
                    You understand that it was wrong 
                    for me to call them idiots, right?  
                      I shouldn't have done that.

                                  ETHAN
                    It did seem like a strange way to 
                    ask them for money.

      John laughs, which causes Ethan to laugh.

                                  JOHN
                    You're right.  There's an old 
                    saying.  It's easier to catch a fly 
                    with honey than with vinegar.  Does 
                    that make sense?

                                  ETHAN
                    Today was vinegar.

                                  JOHN
                    Exactly.

      The door opens and Molly enters.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)

                    They were pretty clear before I

                    Nobody actually used the words "pry 
                    it from our cold, dead hands", but 
                    that was basically the gist.

      Ethan stands up and gives her a hug.  She hugs him back, but 
      makes it quick.

                    We got a model ship.  Want to help

                    Sure.

      INT. OPERATING THEATER - DAY

      A highly sterilized environment.  Dark, with lots of shiny 
      surfaces.  LED readouts and monitors on the wall, and some 
      holographic floating displays.

        A HALF-DOZEN MEDICAL TECHS in scrubs, masks and gloves 
      shuffle about, checking the monitors and adjusting levels.

      In the center of the room, on a dark slab of an examining 
      table, is a long, rectangular mass of translucent goo, like a 
      glob of yellow tinted gelatin.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

      CONTINUED:

      Suspended in the middle of this goo is a NAKED MAN.

      A door to the room slides open and Sparks enters, in mask, 
      gloves and footies. He nods to one of the Techs.

      The Medical Techs surround the mass of goo and begin to dig 
      their hands into it, scooping it away to dig out the body 
      buried underneath.

      Slowly, they reveal a sleeping Japanese man, in his mid to 
      late 40's.  This is MATSUMO.

      Sparks watches them clear the goo away, first the big chunks 
      with their hands, then the film with a spray wand.

      The goo is collected and put into plastic containers.

      A tube is inserted in Matsumo's throat and a brown liquid is 
      extracted.  A Med Tech places a small sensor near Matsumo's 
      heart, and it pulses.

      Matsumo coughs up a bit of the brown goo and regains 
      consciousness.  He opens his eyes and takes in the room.

      He makes eye contact with Sparks, who nods.

      INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

      Sparks waits for Matsumo in a small, sterile room with a 
      large spread of fruit on the table.

      Matsumo enters in a robe, looking freshly showered.  He makes 
      a beeline for the fruit and begins to devour it.

                                  SPARKS
                    We found something of an anomaly on 
                    the Seraph mission.

                    Yes?

                                  SPARKS
                    A solar flare knocked out the 
                      communications system.

                                    MATSUMO
                    The same thing that happened to 
                    Harmon Coulter?

                                  SPARKS
                    Yes.  But, unlike Coulter, we're 
                    missing security camera footage for 
                    the thirteen hours that followed.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.

                                  SPARKS
                    Because of the astronaut involved.  
                    Molly Watts.  She claims she 
                      accidentally deleted the footage.

                                    MATSUMO
                    You don't believe her?

                                  SPARKS
                    No.

                                    MATSUMO
                    Why not?

                                  SPARKS
                    Because, she doesn't make those 
                    kinds of mistakes.  It could be 
                    nothing.

                                    MATSUMO
                    But, it could be everything.

                                  SPARKS
                    I have her under surveillance, and 
                    we'll monitor her psych evals, 
                    closely.  I'll let you know the 
                    moment anything out of the ordinary 
                    pops up.

                                    MATSUMO
                    Stay close. 

                                  SPARKS
                    That's the other thing I wanted to 
                    mention.  Her husband John gave a 
                      presentation to your board, 
                    today...

      INT. WATTS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      The model ship is nearly complete.  Molly, Ethan and John 
      polish off a pizza they had delivered.  Music plays over the 
      house audio system.  Family night at home.

                                  JOHN
                    Who needs another soda?

                                  ETHAN
                    Me.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

      CONTINUED:

                                  MOLLY
                    I'm good.

      John leaves.  Molly takes a piece and looks for a place for 
      it.  Ethan watches her, closely.

                                  ETHAN
                    You hair looks pretty.

      Molly smiles at him.  She gives him a kiss on the head.

                                  MOLLY
                    Thank you.

      Ethan looks at the model, but he smiles to himself, pleased 
      at how this exchange went.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    We're down to the last three 
                    pieces.

                                  ETHAN
                    One for each of us.

                                  MOLLY
                    Wanna go first?

      Ethan takes a piece and snaps it into place.

      Molly takes hers and snaps it into place.

                                  ETHAN
                    Dad?

      John reenters with the sodas.  Ethan holds out the piece.

                                  JOHN
                    This is the last one?  Are you 
                    serious?

                                  MOLLY
                    It's all yours.

      John puts it into place and the three of them watch as the 
      ship comes to life.

      It lights up and the sounds of liftoff are heard.

      The model floats up off the table and hovers in the air.

                                  ETHAN
                    Wow.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

      CONTINUED: (2)

                                  JOHN
                    That is cool.

      Molly watches them, they're in awe of the ship.  She's lost 
      in thought but snaps back when Ethan looks at her.  She 
      feigns a bit of excitement.

      An automated female voice cuts through the music.  This 
      belongs to GINA, the voice of the home's Verdisign system.

      (*A word about The Verdisign System: this is the operating 
      system and bits of hardware that nearly every family in the 
      world uses to run their daily lives.  It is vertically 
      integrated into their homes, their cars, their phones and to 
      a small extent, their bodies.)

                                  GINA (VO)
                    John you have an incoming call from 
                    Matsumo Corp.

      The family freezes.  John quickly locates his phone.

                                  JOHN
                          (into phone)
                      Hello....yes, it is...

      He gives Molly a wide-eyed look.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    ...I understand...yes, sir...of 
                      course...yes, sir.  I'll see you, 
                    tomorrow.  Thank you.

      He ends the call.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    That was Kinji Matsumo, himself.

                                  MOLLY
                    What did he want?

                                  JOHN
                    He wants me to come in tomorrow 
                    morning to talk about the Humanichs 
                    project.

      Molly and Ethan congratulate him, hugs all around.

      INT. VAN - NIGHT

      Inside a van, parked on the street near the Watts home.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

      CONTINUED:

      The AUDIO FROM THE CELEBRATION INSIDE comes over a small 
      computer system in the passenger seat.

      In the driver's seat is the silhouette of a MAN, the same 
      silhouette from the alley and John's earlier speech.

                         END ACT 2

                           ACT 3

      INT. WATTS HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

      Molly makes a pot of coffee.  News reports run on a nearby 
      wall screen.

      John enters, decked out in a suit.

                                  MOLLY
                    Time for coffee?

                                  JOHN
                    I don't wanna risk the spill.

                                  MOLLY
                    You look great.

                                  JOHN
                    Do I?  Because, I feel sick.

                                  MOLLY
                    You'll be fine.

                                  JOHN
                    You sure you're ok with Ethan, 
                    today?

                                  MOLLY
                    We'll manage.

                                  JOHN
                    I'm glad you're going to have some 
                    time, just the two of you.  I think 
                    it will help you reconnect.

      Molly nods and smiles.

                                  MOLLY
                    Good luck.

                                  JOHN
                    See you tonight.

      He gives her a kiss and is out the door.                                                                                    32.


      INT. WATTS HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      Molly rounds the corner into the living room and finds Ethan 
      standing there, fully dressed, looking at her.

                                  MOLLY
                    Good morning.

                                  ETHAN
                    Good morning.

                                  MOLLY
                    So, it's just you and me today.

                                  ETHAN
                    I know.

                                  MOLLY
                    I have a little bit of work to do, 
                    but after that, we can do whatever 
                    you want.

                                  ETHAN
                    Can we get some ice cream?  At our 
                    favorite place in the park?

                                  MOLLY
                    Sure.

      EXT. WATTS HOME - DAY

      The garage door opens and Molly's car pulls out.  She and 
      Ethan drive past the van that was parked in the same spot 
      last night.

      INT. VAN - DAY

      The silhouetted figure in the van watches Molly's car drive 
      down the street.

      It looks back towards the house just in time to see a white 
      utility truck with the Verdisign logo pull up out front.

      TWO MEN in work clothes exit the truck with small tool kits 
      and make their way to the back of the Watts home.

      INT. MATSUMO TOWER - ELEVATOR - DAY

      John rides alone with a SECURITY GUARD.  The elevator reaches 
      the top floor and stops.

      The doors open and John steps out.                                                                                    33.


      INT. MATSUMO TOWER - TOP FLOOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      John steps out into an office as zen as any corporate office 
      could possibly be.  Minimal furniture.  Wall screens run 
      stock tickers and digital art of Japanese gardens.

      Matsumo appears, wearing a sharp suit.

                                    MATSUMO
                    Doctor Watts.  Kinji Matsumo.

                                  JOHN
                    It's an honor.

                                    MATSUMO
                    Please, the honor is all mine.

      He ushers John down a hall.

                                    MATSUMO (CONT D)
                    I hear you butted heads with some 
                    of my board members.

                                  JOHN
                    I guess I did.

                                    MATSUMO
                    Welcome to my world.

      INT. MATSUMO TOWER - EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY

      John and Matsumo have tea at a table near a floor to ceiling 
      window.  The view of the city is spectacular.

      Occasionally, we see a PERSONAL AUTO/AIRCRAFT hybrid fly by.

                                    MATSUMO
                    One thing I'm curious about.  As 
                    the parents or guardians age, what 
                    happens to the Humanichs?

                                  JOHN
                    Ideally, every year, their physical 
                    body would be upgraded to a 
                    slightly more mature model, until 
                    they're a fully grown adult.

                                    MATSUMO
                    And, their brain, for lack of a 
                    better term is...





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

                                  JOHN
                      Transplanted into the new body. All 
                    of the information exists on a 
                    series of hard drives that is 
                    regularly backed up to the parent's 
                    Verdisign servers.  All of their 
                    memories, their personality, all of 
                    that will continue to evolve in the 
                    same way.

                                    MATSUMO
                      Fascinating.

                                  JOHN
                    Of course, a parent could opt to 
                    let their child stay in the same 
                    body, if they wanted to, or if they 
                    couldn't afford the upgrade.

                                    MATSUMO
                    And, what do you imagine will 
                    happen to the Humanich when the 
                    parent dies?

                                  JOHN
                    My hope is at that point they are a 
                    fully functioning member of 
                    society.  The could live just like 
                    we live.

                                    MATSUMO
                    I ask these questions for a reason.  
                    You're an intelligent man, you 
                      understand that the future you're 
                    proposing is a future fraught with 
                    all sorts of practical issues.  Not 
                    to mention a whole new host of 
                    moral and ethical problems that 
                    will no doubt be debated and argued 
                    over in the court of public opinion 
                    for years to come.

                                  JOHN
                    Yes, but it's also a future fraught 
                    with great possibility.

                                    MATSUMO
                    I agree, I do.  Unfortunately, the 
                    long term prospects of your vision 
                    are a bit too murky for Matsumo 
                    Corp to invest in at this time.

                                    MATSUMO
                    I'm afraid the board's decision 
                    will have to stand.

      John is heartbroken, but keeps his professional composure.

                                  JOHN
                      I understand.

                                    MATSUMO
                    As a corporation, we have certain 
                      responsibilities to our 
                      shareholders.

                                  JOHN
                    Of course.  I just appreciate your 
                    time.

                                    MATSUMO
                    As a private citizen, 
                      however...say, as a silent 
                      partner...I would not be bound by 
                    those same responsibilities.

      Matsumo smiles.  John puts it together.

      INT. ISEA - MOLLY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

      Ethan sits on a couch and plays his video game as Molly lets 
      herself into the inner office via finger scan.

                                  MOLLY
                    I'll just be a couple of minutes.

                                  ETHAN
                    Ok.

      INT. ISEA - MOLLY'S INNER OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      Molly wakes her computer with a finger swipe.

      She fingerprints her way in for security clearance.  She 
      types in a few words and waits.

      The screen shows images of an AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN, not much 
      older than Molly.

      His name scrolls across the screen: HARMON COULTER




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

      CONTINUED:

      Molly enters some more commands, a request for: SERAPH 
      MISSION 0037 DEBRIEFING.

      An alert comes up: ACCESS DENIED.

      She closes that window and opens a window for Verdisign.  She 
      enters "HARMON COULTER'S" name and waits.

      A number of articles begin to appear, with pictures of a 
      smiling Harmon Coulter in his spacesuit.

      The headlines are various reports of his apparent suicide.

      A number of video clips begin to play.  Coulter in his 
      spacesuit, boarding a rocket.  Giving a speech to a classroom 
      full of school children.

      Molly flicks through the articles and videos.

      INT. SURVEILLANCE BAY - DAY

      The exact same images show up on a screen in a small, dark 
        surveillance room.

      Sparks watches the information scroll by.  He's watching 
      Molly's actions on her computer in real time.  Every article 
      she reads, every word she types.

      INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY

      Sam exits her office and walks down the hallway. 

      After she disappears around the corner, the Silhouetted 
      Figure rounds the corner and scans its way into her office.

      INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

      A gloved hand scans across Sam's computer screen with a small 
      handheld device and wakes it up.  An LED screen on the device 
      displays scrolling numbers and symbols.

      Replicating her fingerprint password.

      Once complete, the hands begin to enter commands on the 
      screen, bringing up Molly's medical reports.

                                                              CUT TO:

      The gloved hands search through file cabinets and desk 
      drawers.  The small handheld device also grants access to the 
      safe underneath the desk.                                                                                    37.


      INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY

      Sam walks back in the direction of her office.

      Deputy Director Kern approaches from behind.

                                  KERN
                    Sam.

                                  SAM
                    What are you doing here?

                                  KERN
                    Relax, it's not personal.

                                  SAM
                    Then, what is it?

                                  KERN
                    The post exams for Molly Watts.

                                  SAM
                    I'll have them for you by the end 
                    of the day.

                                  KERN
                    Great.

                                  SAM
                    Is that all?

                                  KERN
                    Yep.

                                  SAM
                    Great.

      She walks away.  Kern watches her go, and it's clear he was 
      hoping it would go much better.

      INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

      Sam enters her office and shuts the door behind her.

      A gloved hand immediately covers her mouth.

      EXT. PARK - NEAR ICE CREAM STAND - DAY

      Molly and Ethan sit on the bench near a small ice cream 
      stand.  Both with oversized cones.

      Ethan eats his while Molly punches in Sam's name on her 
      phone.  She dials, and waits.  No answer.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

      CONTINUED:

      She hangs up and takes a breath.

                                  MOLLY
                    How is it?

                                  ETHAN
                    Good.  Do you want to try it?

                                  MOLLY
                    Sure.

      She does.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    That is good.  Do you want to try 
                    mine?

      He nods.  She gives him a taste.

                                  ETHAN
                    I like yours better.

                                  MOLLY
                    That's called food envy.  Do you 
                    want to switch?

                                  ETHAN
                    Ok.

      They do.  He takes a bite and ends up with a bit of an ice 
      cream mustache. 

      Molly watches him eat his ice cream for a moment.

      A BALLOON VENDOR approaches with two balloons.

                                  MOLLY
                    No thank you.

                                    BALLOON VENDOR
                    They were already paid for.

      He hands one to Ethan.

                                    BALLOON VENDOR (CONT D)
                    This one is for you.

                                  MOLLY
                    Paid for by who?

                                    BALLOON VENDOR
                    The man right...




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

      CONTINUED: (2)

      He turns and looks behind him, but there's no one there.

                                    BALLOON VENDOR (CONT D)
                    He's gone.  Sorry.

      Molly sees a card attached to the bottom of her balloon.  She 
      opens it.

      A message inside reads: "I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. 

      CONTACT SOON.  TRUST NO ONE."

      Molly grabs Ethan's arm and pulls him off the bench.

                                  MOLLY
                    We have to go.

                                  ETHAN
                    Mom...

      He drops his ice cream cone.

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    You made me drop my ice cream.

                                  MOLLY
                    Here.  You can have this one back.

      She tries to give him the one he had before.

                                  ETHAN
                    I don't want that one.  I want 
                    another one like this.

                                  MOLLY
                    But, this is the one you picked.

                                  ETHAN
                    I don't want it, anymore.

                                  MOLLY
                    Ethan, we have to go.  Now.

                                  ETHAN
                    I want another ice cream.

                                  MOLLY
                    I said let's go!

                                  ETHAN
                    No!




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    40.

      CONTINUED:

      She yanks his arm and drags him away.  He shrugs her off and 
      takes off running through the park.

                                  MOLLY
                    Ethan!

      She chases after him.

      EXT. PARK TRAILS - DAY

      Ethan runs into a wooded area, along a trail.

      Molly runs after him.

                                  MOLLY
                    Ethan!

      He disappears in the trees.

      EXT. PARK TRAILS - DAY

      Molly searches for him in another section of the trail, 
      exhausted and panicked.

      She looks into a patch of weeds and sees his form, standing a 
      few dozen yards away, facing away from her.

                                  MOLLY
                    Hey!  Answer me.

      He doesn't.  She trudges through the weeds and finds him 
      looking down at something on the ground.

      It's a dead crow, laying at his feet.

      Molly stops.  Ethan turns and looks up at her.

                                  ETHAN
                    It was like this when I found it.

      Molly looks at the crow.  It doesn't look like it's been 
      there long.  She looks back to Ethan.

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    Your hair looks really pretty.

      INT. WATTS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Molly opens the front door and Ethan follows her in.  He 
      marches upstairs, without a word and shortly after, a DOOR 
      SLAM is heard.

      Molly flips on the lights. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

                    John?

      She walks through the house.

      EXT. WATTS HOME - BACKYARD - NIGHT

      Molly steps out of the house and into the backyard, towards a 
      small building at the back.

      There's a light on inside and music playing.

      Molly opens the door and steps inside...

      INT. JOHN'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

      In another time, another place, this might have been a 
      charming, quiet spot to do some woodworking.

      But, instead of various bits of wood and carpentry tools 
      laying about, there are synthetic body parts stacked up on 
      shelves and hanging from racks on the walls.

      Mostly child-sized, which makes it more than a bit creepy.

      There are also tools of this new trade, including computer 
      monitors and magnifying glasses, and storage containers of 
      glowing filaments.  3-D synthetic flesh printers.

      In one corner, John is perched on a stool, attaching strands 
      of filament to a tiny synthetic hand.

      He puts one in and the hand twitches.

      He sees Molly and hops up.

                                  JOHN
                    How did it go?

      INT. WATTS HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Molly bursts through the back door, John on her heels.

                                  JOHN
                    You have to give it time.  He's 
                    just not used to you being home.

                                  MOLLY
                    I don't know what's going on, but 
                    he's not the same as when I left.

                                  JOHN
                    He's not.  He's a year older.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

                                  MOLLY
                    I don't mean that.  I mean he's 
                    changed.

                                  JOHN
                    And, so have you.  That's called 
                    life.  That's the consequence of 
                    our family being apart for so long, 
                    it takes time to reconnect.

                                  MOLLY
                    You should have seen the way he 
                    looked at me.  It was like he hated 
                    me.

                                  JOHN
                    He doesn't hate you, he loves you.

                                  MOLLY
                    He doesn't love me, John.  He 
                    executes a series of commands that 
                    you've programmed into him.  He 
                      approximates a behavior that 
                    resembles love.

      This strikes a blow and she knows it.

      John sits down in a chair.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    I'm sorry.  I didn't...

                                  JOHN
                    I've spent years of my life trying 
                    to give this to you.  Because you 
                    wanted a child that you couldn't 
                    have.  I didn't blame you, I didn't 
                    leave you, I just went to work to 
                    solve the problem.  I don't know 
                    what happened that caused you to 
                    pull away from him...or from 
                    us...but I've felt it, and he's 
                    felt it, ever since you got back. 
                    Whatever it is, I hope you figure 
                    it out, because that kid is the 
                    closest we're ever going to get to 
                    being parents.

      John stands up and heads to the back door.  Just before he 
      goes out, he turns back.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    I got the funding from Matsumo.

      He leaves and closes the door behind him.

      Molly stands there, alone.

      INT. SERAPH SPACE STATION - TERRARIUM - NIGHT

      Molly enters commands on a small tablet device and a red 
      blinking light appears.  She speaks into it.

                                  MOLLY
                    Seraph mission 0038, log addendum A 
                    solar flare disrupted the station's 
                    power and communications systems. 
                    In the moments after the outage, I 
                      discovered that I was no longer 
                    alone up here.  There's something 
                    on the other side of this door. 
                    Something that appears to be a 
                    human male, someone that I knew 
                    very well, once.  I know it's not 
                    this person because, well...for 
                    one, this person has been dead for 
                    twenty years.  But, whatever it is, 
                    it's asking for help.  I have no 
                    way of communicating with the ISEA 
                    command center, so I've made the 
                    decision on my own.  If there's 
                    even a tiny chance that this is a 
                    first contact situation, I don't 
                    want to risk losing the 
                      opportunity.  I've recorded this 
                    message in the event that...in the 
                    even that something goes wrong, 
                    there will be some documentation. 
                    I've decided to open the door.

      Molly turns and walks slowly to the door.  She takes a moment 
      to breathe.

      She punches a series of commands into a wall panel and the 
      door HISSES open.

      She stands there.  Waiting.

      INT. SERAPH SPACE STATION - TERRARIUM - NIGHT

      Molly sees Marcus standing in front of her, the door no 
      longer a barrier between them.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

      CONTINUED:

      She backs away, slowly.  Marcus steps through the doorway, 
      cautiously.  They're in the same room Ten yards apart.

      They both stand completely still, taking the other in.

                                  MOLLY
                    Hello.

      Marcus takes a moment.

                                  MARCUS
                    Hello.

                                  MOLLY
                    Who are you?

                                  MARCUS
                          (mimicking her pattern)
                    Who are you?

                                  MOLLY
                    Molly.

                                  MARCUS
                    Molly.

                                  MOLLY
                    You need help.

                                  MARCUS
                    Help.

                                  MOLLY
                    On the window.  You asked for my 
                    help.

                                  MARCUS
                    Help.

                                  MOLLY
                    What can I do?

      Marcus takes a step forward and slowly raises his hand, 
      extending his fingers towards her.

      Molly breathes heavily.  She takes a few slow steps forward 
      and extends her fingers as well, bringing their fingertips 
      nearly together.

      Marcus moves forward, until there's actual contact.  Molly 
      relaxes a little bit and moves forward as well, until their 
      bodies are in close proximity.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

      He studies her hands and her face.  Holds a finger up near 
      her cheek.  She seems to understand what he's asking for and 
      gives him a nod.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    It's ok.

      Marcus traces his finger over her face and down her neck.

      He studies her reaction, her breathing.

      His finger traces down the center of her body and comes to a 
      stop at her stomach.

      He looks back up to her eyes with a warm smile.  Takes her 
      hand in his and puts it on his cheek.

                                  MARCUS
                    It's ok.

      Molly caresses his cheek.  Her expression is awash in 
      alternating waves of wonder and joy.

      Marcus puts his hand on her stomach and studies it.  The 
      smile disappears, evolves into something cold and detached.

      Something about this starts to unnerve Molly and she tries to 
      pull away.  He jerks her back into him and presses a hand to 
      her face.

      She struggles against him.

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    It's ok.

      He puts his thumbs to her temples and she begins to go 
        unconscious.  As she's fading, she briefly catches a glimpse 
      of his face morphing into something other than human.

      As he repeats...

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    It's ok.  It's ok.

      INT. WATTS HOME - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY

      Molly throws up in the toilet.

      She dials a number on her phone.

      INT. WATTS HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

      Molly enters the kitchen, dressed for work.  She's in a 
      hurry, but stops when she runs into John.

                                  JOHN
                    Hey.

                                  MOLLY
                    Hey.  Listen...

                    Wait, before you...about last 
                    night...

                                  MOLLY
                    I'm sorry.

                                  JOHN
                    No, I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have 
                      brought...I didn't build Ethan for 
                    you.  I built him for us.  For me, 
                    too.  But, we made that decision 
                    together.

                                  MOLLY
                    I know.

                                  JOHN
                    For the past year, I've done a 
                    hundred per cent of the parenting, 
                    while you got to do the work that 
                    you're passionate about.  Now, I 
                    have an opportunity like that of my 
                    own, but in order for it to work, 
                    you're going to have to carry the 
                    load for awhile.  It won't work if 
                    you don't make a real attempt to 
                    reconnect with him.

                                  MOLLY
                    You're right.  And, I'm sorry I 
                    haven't been able to do that, yet.  
                    I think there's just...there's some 
                    part of me that's still up there. 
                    But, I'm working on it.  My first 
                    psych eval is today.

                    we'll sit down as a family and 
                    we'll give it another try.  Ok?

                                  JOHN

      She leaves.

      INT. JOHN'S WORKSHOP - DAY

      Ethan stands in his father's workshop, looking over the walls 
      of body parts that are not unlike his own.

      He glances to a nearby monitor and sees a screen that lists a 
      series of software patches.

      He gets closer to it and reads down the list.  There are 
      languages, personality traits, banks of specialized knowledge 
      in areas like science and music.

      The door opens and John enters.  Ethan freezes.

                                  JOHN
                    What are you doing in here?

                                  ETHAN
                    I was looking for you.

                                  JOHN
                    You know you're not allowed to be 
                    in here.

                                  ETHAN
                    I'm sorry.

                                  JOHN
                    Let's go.  Out.

                                  ETHAN
                    What are these?

                                  JOHN
                    Software patches for androids. 
                    Upgrades, to give them specialized 
                    knowledge or abilities.

                                  ETHAN
                    Can I have some?

                                  JOHN
                    No.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

                                  JOHN
                    Because, you don't learn anything 
                    that way.  Your brain doesn't 
                    develop.

                                  ETHAN
                    What if I want to learn piano?

                    Then, we'll get you some lessons.

      Ethan just stares at the screen.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Hey.  This is off-limits, do you 
                      understand?

                                  ETHAN
                    Yes.

                                  JOHN
                    It's cheating.  What's the rule?

                                  ETHAN
                    We don't cheat.

                                  JOHN
                    Exactly, and if you break that 
                    rule, there will be consequences. 
                    Nod your head if you're still 
                      listening.

      Ethan nods his head.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Good.  Come on.

      John ushers him out.

      INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY

      Sam opens the door for Molly.  She's smiling and cheerful.

                      prescription.  It may help relieve 
                    any nausea or motion sickness you 
                    might feel as you're settling back 
                    in.  Sometimes it takes awhile for 
                    your equilibrium to even out.

      She rips off the sheet and hands it to Molly.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    I bet John's glad to have you back.

      Molly reads the sheet.  It says, "NOT NOW.  THEY ARE 
      LISTENING."

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    He seemed so happy at the party. 
                    Oh, speaking of, I think I left my 
                    cake pan at your house...

      Molly gets with the program.

                                  MOLLY
                    Was that yours?  I'm sorry...




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

                                  SAM
                    No, please, it was my fault.  Maybe 
                    I can swing by on my way home 
                    tonight to pick it up?

                                  MOLLY
                    Sure.

                                  SAM
                    I'm so sorry to rush, but I have to 
                    get to a meeting down the hall.

                                  MOLLY
                    Of course.

                                  SAM
                    See you tonight, then?

                                  MOLLY
                    We'll be there.

      INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

      Molly is alone outside Sam's office.

                                  LAURIE (VO)
                    Reentry can be a challenge after 
                    this kind of extended mission, 
                      especially if there are spouses and 
                    children involved.

      Molly walks down the hall.  She passes a few STAFF MEMBERS 
      and glances over just in time to catch them give her a look.

                                  LAURIE (VO) (CONT D)
                    The agency would like us to meet 
                    for a few sessions...

      INT. LAURIE'S OFFICE - DAY

        A minimalist therapist's office.

      Molly sits across from LAURIE VINSON (40's).

                                  LAURIE
                    ...just to make sure that you have 
                    all the tools you need for this 
                      transition back to real life.  We 
                    didn't have this resource in place 
                    for your colleague, Mr. Coulter.  
                                  (MORE)




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                    Of course, there's no way to know 
                    for sure, but the agency believes 
                    that a lack of attention to his 
                    mental health may have been a 
                    factor in his suicide.  It's 
                    important that you understand, 
                    anything you say here to me is 
                    covered under a very strict 
                      doctor/patient confidentiality 
                      agreement...

      Molly hears this and begins to look around at the various 
      objects in the room.  The items on the desk.  The lamps.

      She looks up at the overhead lights.

                                  LAURIE (CONT D)
                    I want this office to be a 
                    sanctuary for you...a place where 
                    you're free to talk about anything 
                    and everything...

      INT. SURVEILLANCE BAY - DAY

      Sparks watches the scene in Laurie's office on his monitor, 
      courtesy of an overhead surveillance camera.

      He flips through her medical reports as he listens.

                                  LAURIE (ON SCREEN)
                    Do you understand?

                                  MOLLY (ON SCREEN)
                    Yes.

                                  LAURIE (ON SCREEN)
                      Wonderful.

      INT. MATSUMO TOWER - EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY

      Matsumo sits by the window and watches the same feed on the 
      monitor on his desk.

                                  LAURIE (ON SCREEN)
                    Why don't we begin with your own 
                      assessment about where you are in 
                    your transition.  How are you 
                    feeling?

      INT. LAURIE'S OFFICE - DAY

      Molly thinks this over.                                                                                    52.


      INT. SERAPH SPACE STATION - TERRARIUM - NIGHT

      Molly opens her eyes.

      She's lying on the floor of the terrarium.  When she comes 
      to, she bolts up in a panic.

      She scrambles to her feet and looks around the room, 
      terrified.  There's no one there.

      She does a more thorough check to make sure.

      She rushes to the pod door and punches in the commands to 
      close and lock it again.

      It HISSES shut and the sound startles her.

                                                              JUMP CUT TO:

      Molly plays back her earlier recording.  She sees herself 
      onscreen, opening the door.  She sees herself back up.  And, 
        then...nothing.

      She scrolls forward in the footage.

      She stops at a moment where her onscreen version has her 
      hands extended.  The moment where she had been touching 
      Marcus's face.

      Only there's no Marcus.

      She's confused and starting to lose it.

                                                              JUMP CUT TO:

      Molly pulls up footage from the Seraph's security system on 
      the computer.  She cycles through different camera 
        angles...herself in the terrarium, looking through the 
      door...to the empty corridor on the other side.

      She's in tears at this point.  She looks around, unsure of 
      what to do.  Takes a moment and pulls herself together.

      She enters a series of commands on the computer.  A prompt 
      appears, asking: "DELETE?"

      She presses the enter key and begins to delete all of the 
      security footage.

      INT. WATTS HOME - ETHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Ethan sits in his room, his door closed.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    53.

      CONTINUED:

      He looks at a small tablet device displaying the same screen 
      of software patches he had been looking at earlier.

      John calls out from downstairs.

                                  JOHN (OS)
                    Ethan!  Let's eat!

      Ethan shuts the tablet down and heads downstairs.

      INT. WATTS HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

      John places a bowl of pasta on the table as Ethan enters and 
      takes a seat.

                                  JOHN
                    Hungry?

                                  ETHAN
                    Yes.

      Molly enters and gives Ethan a hug.

                                  MOLLY
                    I got you something.

      She holds out a container of ice cream.

                                  ETHAN
                    Ice cream?

                                  MOLLY
                    Since you didn't get to finish it, 
                      yesterday.

                                  ETHAN
                    Can I have some now?

                                  MOLLY
                      Absolutely not.

      She takes it back into the kitchen.

                                  JOHN
                    What do you say?

                                  ETHAN
                    I'm sorry about what happened in 
                    the park.

                                  MOLLY (OS)
                    Apology accepted.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    54.

      CONTINUED:

      John sits in his seat and passes the bowl to Ethan.  Molly 
      reenters and takes her seat.

      The pasta bowl is passed around until it gets back to John. 
      The others wait for him.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    This looks great.

                                  ETHAN
                    May I have some cheese, please?

      John looks up at the two of them.

                                  JOHN
                    This is perfect.

                                  ETHAN
                    What is?

                                  JOHN
                    This.  Just this.

      He smiles at Molly.  She starts to return it, but Gina, the 
      Verdisign voice interrupts.

                                  GINA (VO)
                    Doctor O'Donnell is approaching the 
                    front door.

                                  MOLLY
                    I'll get it.  Excuse me.

      EXT. WATTS HOME - NIGHT

      Molly opens the door to find Sam on the porch.

                                  MOLLY
                    Hi, I looked all over for your pan 
                    and I couldn't find it.

                                  SAM
                    That's ok, I probably just forgot 
                    and put it away.

      Sam walks her off the porch and into the yard.

                                  MOLLY
                    I'm sorry you came all the way over 
                    here.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    55.

                                  SAM
                    No, it's all right.  An old friend 
                    is in town so we're just out 
                    running around, anyway.

      She looks to her car across the street.

      Molly looks over and the door opens.  The silhouetted figure 
      we've seen, the man with the gloves, steps out.

      In the dim glow of the street lamp, Molly can just make out 
      his features.  She recognizes his face instantly as the man 
      she'd read about, her colleague, HARMON COULTER.

                        END ACT 4

                          ACT 5

      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

      Molly and Coulter talk in the shadows, away from the house.

                                  MOLLY
                    Everyone thinks you're dead.

                                    COULTER
                    Not Sparks.

                                  MOLLY
                    Why do you say that?

                                    COULTER
                    Because he's the one who identified 
                    the body.

                                  MOLLY
                    What body?

                                    COULTER
                    Exactly.

                                  MOLLY
                    It happened to you, too?

                                    COULTER
                    Yes.

                                  MOLLY
                    Who did you see?

                                    COULTER
                    My mother.

                                  MOLLY
                    And, you didn't tell them?

                                    COULTER
                    I told them.  I was worried they 
                    would think I was crazy.

                                  MOLLY
                    What happened?

                                    COULTER
                    I was right.

                                  MOLLY
                    But, why do it, why fake your own 
                    death?

                                    COULTER
                    Because, there's work to do, work 
                    that they can't know about.  Work 
                    that you and I will have to do, 
                    together.

                                  MOLLY
                    I don't understand.

                                    COULTER
                    Molly, you and I are on the 
                    precipice of something monumental, 
                    something that is going to change 
                    the world, forever.  At first, I
