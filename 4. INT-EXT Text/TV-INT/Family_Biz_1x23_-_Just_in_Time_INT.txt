                    be you - as my designated driver.

                    No worries.  I'll be with you every
                    step of the way.

      OFF Eli's dread -

      DAVE'S DESKTOP

      We travel from home to school.  A COLOUR CODED LAMINATED
      SCHEDULE for Eli unfolds like a road map.


      Dave bursts into the room, schedule in hand.

                                    DAVE
                    ELI!  What are you doing?  Trying to
                    look good for the ladies?

      Dave ruffles Eli's hair.

                                    ELI
                    I just had my part right.

                                    DAVE
                          (re: scheduler)
                    Okay, we only scheduled five minutes
                    of free time.  This is the last time
                    I let you go to the bathroom alone...

                                    ELI
                    You're going to leave me with some
                    deep emotional scars.

                                    DAVE
                    As a parent that's my job.  Now..


      Dave and Eli emerge from the washroom.

                                    DAVE
                    ...move.

      Eli heads right.

                                    DAVE (CONT'D)
                    Towards class.

      Eli reverses direction.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             11.

                                    ELI
                    Right.

      Eli reverses directions again.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    I'm a little hungry.  I need to get
                    something from the vending machine.

                                    DAVE
                    Eli!

                                    ELI
                    Right.  Well actually left.

      Eli reverses directions again.  They start down the hall. 
      Eli stops abruptly, distracted by -

      A new HOT GIRL.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                          (to Dave)
                    Who's she?

                                    DAVE
                    Keep going.

      Eli stops at...

                                    ELI
                    Hey, is that a new health poster? 
                    Cool colors.

                                    DAVE
                    Move!  Move!  Move!

      Dave hustles Eli along.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Dave arrives.

                                    DAVE
                    And here we are... thirty seconds to
                    spare.  Eli?

      Dave whips around.  Where's Eli?

                                    DAVE (CONT'D)
                    Eli!

                    series...

      As Dave pulls Eli OUT OF FRAME -

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    Urk!

      And they run into...

                    Mr. Keller, Eli.  Good, you're here

                                    DAVE
                    Can't talk now.  We need to hustle

                                    ELI
                    My people will call your people.

      As Dave marks up Eli's Schedule with a marker, he shoves Eli
      forward.

                                    DAVE & PRINCIPAL PAL

      Dave tries to move Eli down the hall.  Eli lags behind...

                                    DAVE
                    Study hall is this way...

                                    ELI
                          (smells something)
                    But lunch is this way. 

      Eli blows past Dave like a speed walker.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             13.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    Dad, faster.  Focus.  It's lunch.

                                                                              SWOOSH TO:


      Dave and Eli come in from the Mud Room. 

                                    ELI
                    ...and home.  Whoo hoooo!

      He checks his wrist.  Still no watch.  He checks Dave's wrist.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    On time.  To the second.  Dad, I
                    don't say this often but... your
                    planrked.  Thank you.

      Dave's scribbled all over Eli's schedule.  He's worried.

                                    DAVE
                    Friday's looking tricky though

                                    ELI
                    But with you riding shotgun I can
                    squeeze in even more cool stuff. 

                                    DAVE
                    More cool stuff?!

      Avalon swings through.

                                      AVALON
                    Need a favour.  There's a pizza in
                    it for you.

                                    ELI
                    I'm in.

                                    DAVE
                    Don't you want to know what it is?

                                    ELI
                    A round form of food topped by
                    pepperoni and... oh, what favour?

                                      AVALON
                    Tomorrow you pick up Ronnie after
                    school for me. 

                                    ELI
                    Hang on.  Why can't you do it?

                                      AVALON
                    I have some...thing.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             16.

                                    ELI
                            (suspicious)
                    Think?  What thing?

                                      AVALON
                          (points behind Eli)
                    Look!  Cookies!

                                    ELI
                          (looks around)
                    Where?

      And Avalon disappears.  Eli turns back.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    How does she do that?

      Eli heads into...


      ...and Dave follows.

                    By distracting you, son.  Which is
                    not all that hard to do.  Which is
                    why you are always late. 

                                    ELI
                      I disagree.

                                    DAVE
                    Eli, you get distracted by food.

      Distracted, Eli opens the fridge.

                                    ELI
                    Let's see what we've got.

                                    DAVE
                    ...by girls...

                                    ELI
                    Wonder if Trace is still mad at me? 
                    Maybe if I bring her some salsa...

      Now RONNIE KELLER scooters in to protest. 

                                      RONNIE
                    Dad, why do I have to be picked up
                    by Eli?  He's completely unreliable. 

                                    ELI
                    Not anymore.

                    You'll make every appointment you've

                                    ELI
                    Yes.

                                    DAVE
                    No cancellations.

                                    ELI
                    Nope.  I am focused.

      The phone RINGS.  Distracted, Eli picks up.

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      Trace is on her cell phone.

                    Trace!  Hi.  Avalon's not here...

                                      TRACE
                    That's okay.  I wanted you.

                                    ELI
                    Really?  Right.  Of course you did. 

                                      TRACE
                    I'm giving you another chance.

                                    ELI
                    Why?  I mean: Great.

                                      TRACE
                    Cody explained what happened.

                                    ELI
                    He did? 

                                      TRACE
                    I think it's kinda cool that you

                            (scrambling, what?)
                    I really didn't do much...

                                      TRACE
                    Eli you are too modest. Mouth to
                    mouth?  And she had a mustache? 
                    That is so brave.  You're lucky Cody
                    is your friend.  He really had to

                    So smoothies...Friday?

      Dave waves at Eli trying to prevent a disaster.  Stop!

                                      TRACE
                    Friday.  Five o'clock.  Bye.

      Eli hangs up, so very happy.

                                    ELI
                    YES!

      Dave and Ronnie stare at him.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    What?  Oh.  It's just one more thing.

                                    DAVE
                    Ronnie.  Conference.

      Dave and Ronnie go to the kitchen island.  They unfold the
      Eli Laminated Schedule and confer.  Dave marks down...

                                    DAVE (CONT'D)
                    And Trace at five pm...

                    Wow.  Daddy... that's... impossible.

                    That's what I was thinking.

                                      RONNIE
                    Something has to give.

                                    DAVE
                    Probably Trace.

                                    ELI

                    Dad, I really need your help here.

      Dave takes out a BUNGEE CORD and hooks it up to their belts.

                    This way you can't wander off.

      Eli stretches to the end of the cord.  It SPROINGS.  Eli

                    back.  Right after my snack, Eli.

      Eli pulls in the bungee/lifeline and examines the end.

      The end is shorn off.

      Eli and Dave sprint down the hall scattering STUDENTS and
      SLAMMING lockers in their mad charge.

      Avalon leaves a classroom.  But the mad rush forces her back.

      Starts a routine.

                    Give me an "A"...

                    But not on purpose.  The way you
