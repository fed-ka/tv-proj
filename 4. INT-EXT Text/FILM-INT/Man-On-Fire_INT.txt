GRAND MARQUIS - DAY
They shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat.
These guys are not the police.
A switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the
boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels.
Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf.
Duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.
The phone rings. A bomb going off. Eighteen's
distraught FATHER (family photos of the boy on the wall)
answers.

VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF AN 8' X 4' CELL - DAY
A wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing
it, Eighteen
stands naked blindfolded and shivering. The
back of his
leg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a
little JACK
RUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off
his calf.
A MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates
by cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps
his thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear
scratched.
At a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the
ground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in
tape leaving one ear exposed.

AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY
Samuel Valencia Ramos and his lawyer Jordan Kalfus in the
privacy of an alcove table. Jordan is well heeled, well
connected and well oiled. In that order. Samuel, at 40,
already has the patrician look that has served the male
members of his family for generations. They discuss the
kidnapping, a headline on the paper Jordan tosses aside.
JORDAN
The family paid the ransom and he was
returned two days later.
(laughs; chews)
His father still hasn't gotten up the
nerve to ask him if they fucked him up
the ass.
SAMUEL
And now every mother with money in Mexico
City wants bigger and better bodyguards.
My own wife included.
JORDAN
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
SAMUEL
(laughs grimly)
Do you know what she told me last night?
FLASH TO:
SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
Samuel sits at his baby
grand piano playing a gentle
rendering of 'Delibes'.
His American wife LISA stands
away from him. Just the
sight of her back reveals a
pitch perfect petulance.
She tells him:

LISA
A man's worth can be judged by what he
has or what he owes. Only the amount
matters.
SAMUEL
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me
in the social strata?
LISA
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's
not an extravagance. It's not even for
me; it's for our daughter.
SAMUEL
Our daughter.
She turns at that: a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts
to look at her. She stares, plays him like Chinese
Checkers.
LISA
Our child's safety is at stake.
SAMUEL
(stops playing)
These people are professionals. They
don't waste their time taking children
whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
LISA
Samuel, it is not something we should
skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the
car or outside the school was at least
some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I
feel totally exposed.
She just stares at him.
He melts.
RETURN TO:
AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY
Jordan smiles at his client, enjoys seeing him squirm.
SAMUEL
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be
as beautiful as her mother one day.
JORDAN
Yeah?
And if she was ugly?
Samuel rolls his eyes. Jordan laughs.
Beheading two
cigars, he passes one to Samuel.

JORDAN
All my clients have kidnap and ransom
insurance.
SAMUEL
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and
my family and when it runs out in sixty
days, without a bodyguard, I will not be
able to renew it.
JORDAN
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass
like that is hard to find. Good
bodyguards are even harder.
SAMUEL
(interrupts)
I know! I just had to let one go because
I couldn't afford him!
Jordan lights his cigar.
JORDAN
You need a bodyguard of some description.
It's a dangerous world we live in. But
you will get what you pay for. He
doesn't need to be Superman, does he?
Can you go fifteen grand?
SAMUEL
For a year?
JORDAN
For a few months. Hire someone cheap.
You have to have a bodyguard to keep the
insurance. Then fire him for
incompetence. The important thing is
Lisa's daughter will return to school.
Samuel finally follows the logic.
SAMUEL
And Lisa will be able to save face.
We
won't be the only family without a
bodyguard.
JORDAN
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
SAMUEL
For an American she understands this
country very well.

The remains of
the suitcase are spread around the room.
The main

This is going to cost you big time.
A stripper does a half hearted grind as Rayburn and
Creasy sit at the bar sharing a bottle of 'Jack'.
RAYBURN
You got a secondary search and you had a

Creasy smiles.
PINTA'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
Nine-year-old PINTA MARTIN RAMOS stares out at the
garden, a bit like Creasy, but only a ten yard stare.
Pinta's eyes brim with life. She folds her hands, closes
her eyes, prays. 'Chopin' drifts up from downstairs.
Samuel on the baby grand.
PINTA
Dear God. I do not ask for health. Or
wealth. People ask you so often that you
can't have any left. Give me God what
you still have. Give me what no one else
asks for. Amen.
Pinta grabs a battered old TEDDY BEAR and climbs into

You drive easily. Smoothly.
Creasy doesn't answer, just drives.
SAMUEL (CONT'D)
Were you provided with a gun?
CREASY
Yes.
SAMUEL
Show me, please.
Creasy takes his right hand off the wheel, reaches under
his jacket and passes back a beat-to-shit looking PISTOL.
SAMUEL (CONT'D)
What is it?
CREASY
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
SAMUEL

work. I shouldn't be able to afford you

CREASY

I drink.
SAMUEL
How does it affect you?
CREASY
My coordination. Reaction time. If top

SAMUEL
And what if amateurs try it?

I'll probably kill them.

She steps to the bar to make it.

She abruptly turns away.
Confused for a moment.
Finally:

A few moments and Pinta arrives.
'Cool Hand Pinta'.

Pinta walks over and very formally holds out her hand.
Creasy shakes it. An odd beat.

If they like me.
PINTA
Frank doesn't take to most people.
Do

Frank pads along after them.

A TV and VHS machine in the corner.
PINTA
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him

CREASY
Who's Emilio?
PINTA
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school

afternoon.
Finally Creasy turns, looks at her hard.
CREASY

Looks like he approves of you.
And then, walking on air, she's out the door.
Creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that
comes from years in the military. Front and center he
arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and
a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a
pack of Marlboros and his weathered Zippo. Then, his
beaten up gun and holster. A well-travelled New
Testament is placed in the drawer.

He reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh
bottle of scotch. He breaks the seal, unscrews the cap.
He pours a double... triple... wait, what do you call a
full glass of scotch?
CAW!
The macaw squawks it's disapproval.
He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to
catch it on the back of his hand. An old game with
himself.
His hand is too shaky. The bullet bounces off, hits the
floor. Creasy picks it up. Ejecting the magazine, he
starts to oil the weapon.
CAW! As the macaw squawks, Creasy looks up. It doesn't
feel like this relationship is going to work.

Another glass of scotch is poured.
Creasy's hands oil the holster. The Sig Sauer is slipped

A map is flattened. Creasy's finger traces various
routes, pencils them in. From the house to Pinta's
school.
The macaw squawks again. Creasy steps over, takes the
cage and carries it to the open window. He opens the
cage door.

the CD he bought. As the song ends, Creasy hits the back-
up button. "Blue Bayou" begins again. Creasy takes the
9mm from its holster. As he sits back in his chair...

PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Pinta listens to the music, figures a way to dance to it.
CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
Creasy sits in the dark with his 'Blue Bayou'. Creasy
does not look right. Holding the 9mm, he ejects the
round, tries to catch it on the back of his hand. No
good.
He chambers another round.
Tries again.
Nope.
LINDA RONSTADT
Well I'll never be blue, my dreams come
true, on Blue Bayou...
PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Pinta still dancing, finding a way to be with Creasy
whether he knows it or not. Frank, the dog, watches her
every move, perplexed.
CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
As the song repeats, Creasy chambers yet another round.
Feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into
the chamber. Pinta sings along oblivious. Suddenly the
barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been
pulled. No gun shot. A click. Hammer against shell.
Creasy is confused. He ejects the shell and catches it
in the palm of his hand. Macro photograph / a small dimple
on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his
actions. Pinta still dances.
RAYBURN'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 3.A.M.
Rayburn in bed with his beautiful 19-year-old Mexican
WIFE and their four-year-old SON.
As she leans down to kiss her son, a cellphone rings.
Rayburn looks over at the nightstand. FIVE CELLPHONES
there, one of them ringing. Rayburn finds it.
RAYBURN
Rayburn...
Creasy! What's wrong?
Fingers putting the special bullet into an old matchbox.
It takes it place of honor front and center on the

Silent Creasy driving. Lisa and Pinta in the back.
Creasy steals a look in the mirror. Pinta stares

a look at him.
MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY
Creasy clocks the Corolla, frowns. He pulls a piece of
paper from his pocket. But nothing to write with.
CREASY
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
PINTA
I go to school, don't I?
Sarcasm. He stays calm, doesn't let on what he's
thinking.
CREASY
Please?
Her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a
pencil. Creasy takes it, slows to let the Corolla catch
up. He squints into the mirror to read the plate.
Lisa is oblivious, but as Pinta looks back over her
shoulder...
BRAKE LIGHTS up ahead. Creasy lurches to a stop.
The
Corolla swerves around them disappears ahead.
CREASY
Sorry.
LISA
The traffic takes some getting used to.
As Creasy cranes for a view, another WHITE Corolla comes
by headed the opposite way. They're everywhere. This
relaxes Creasy's paranoia. As he laughs to himself.

Creasy sits in his chair drinking scotch.
All alone
needless to say.
Creasy takes the instructional VHS on bodyguards that
Rayburn gave him and plugs it into the VCR. It's in
Japanese. Shakes his head. He switches off the VCR and
surfs the TV channels instead. Sees talk show with the
editor of REFORMA newspaper, ROSANNA GUERRERO, talking
about organized crime in Mexico.
From out the window, a CAW, then again.
Yet again.
Finally, Creasy stands goes to the window. He leans out,
sees Pinta's window across the lawn from him.
Pinta standing on the terrace. Another CAW.
Creasy decides to play.
He CAWS in return.
Pinta looks around.
Creasy does a pretty good
impersonation.
Hears Pinta CAW again.
CREASY
Hey... Pinta...
She looks up at him.
CREASY
What are you doing?
PINTA
Calling for Emilio's macaw.
I thought I

Blue Bayou plays.
Pinta now listens to Creasy's sound.

Pinta enters
in a RED SATIN DEVIL'S OUTFIT. She looks a
bit forlorn
as she sits at opposite ends of the table
from Creasy.
As she stares at her plate, Creasy starts
to laugh at
what an odd sight she is. All dressed up and
no place to

Wrong move. Pinta stands, marches out of the room.

Pinta thinks just a beat, then shakes her head 'no'.
Liar.
CREASY
I spoke to your mother.
She sends her

Pinta nods. Creasy stands there a beat, then heads for

CREASY
Some bodyguard I turned out to be.
Good

He's halfway out the door.
PINTA

Creasy is confused a moment, but when he sees her open

Pinta looks at him hopefully, but Creasy catches himself.
He's not going to coach a little girl. Finally...
PINTA
I will.

Well, it's a sort of wife.
PINTA
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of

CREASY
In the West, it's one wife for one

different rules.
PINTA
It must be difficult having lots of
wives.
CREASY
You feel sorry for the husband?
PINTA

Yeah. Can you imagine my mother

Maria and Gomez burst out laughing. So funny that Creasy
smiles. Pinta lights up at the sight. A huge victory.

Creasy, you're smiling.
He reverts to a frown. Now Pinta bursts out laughing.
And Creasy can't help but smile again.

Laughter.

Okay, I think now is as good as time as

She takes out a velvet pouch from her pocket. She holds
it out to Creasy. He looks at her, takes it from her
hand. His thick fingers fumble with a delicate
drawstring.
Pinta waits for his reaction as Creasy pours a simple,

Creasy is really affected, tries to hide it.

CREASY
Still not a question.
PINTA
My mom drinks, too...
Why do people

CREASY
Now that's a question. I don't know

I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly
adept at killing.
RAYBURN
He was doing his job, protecting the
girl. If police were involved, you
figure it out. I'm here for him.
MANZANO
So am I.
And Creasy stirs.
Rayburn leans into his friend, Manzano
just behind him.
RAYBURN
You hear me, Crease?
Creasy's eyes slit open.
RAYBURN (CONT'D)
(whispers)
You got three of the fuckers.
All dead.

CREASY
Pinta...
RAYBURN
Two days gone. They're negotiating a
ransom.
MANZANO
These things take time, Mr. Creasy.
Creasy closes his eyes.
RAMOS HOUSE (SIMULTANEOUS)
Technicians, police, Tazinari, Jordan, and Samuel all
listen intently to the call.
VOICE
You have the money.
JORDAN
Yes.
VOICE
OK,repeat the drop instructions.
JORDAN
The money, 10 million U.S. will be
divided into two 15 gallon black canvas
bags each containing five million which
will be checked at the bank by the K&R;
agent. Then driven to the house in an
armored car where it will be transferred
to the delivery car.
VOICE
The car will not be powerful and have no
trunk.
Intercut the above with real time visuals illustrating
the process:
Teller counting the money witnessed by K&R;
agent.
The call between The Voice and Jordan continues.
JORDAN
I need a driver to drive Samuel, the
father.
VOICE
No.
Why?
JORDAN
He has a heart condition.
Angina.
He
responds badly to stress.
VOICE
OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle
and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will
drive around the square two times.
Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it
out the window to I.D. the car.
JORDAN
We need proof of life.
PAUSE.
VOICE
Is the father, there?
Jordan hands the phone to Samuel.
SAMUEL
Hello.

VOICE
If this girl's life
is as important to
you as it is to me,
do not play with the

everything. I am a
professional. You
keep your word and I
will keep mine.
Creasy being wheeled down the hall by a tough plain-
clothed Federal Policeman. Followed by Rayburn, Manzano,
and Rosanna. The uniformed JUDICIAL POLICE are powerless
to stop them.
RAYBURN
What's the deal here?
ROSANNA
I wouldn't gamble leaving him here.
These guys will kill him in a heartbeat
'while trying to stop him from escaping.'
VETERINARIAN'S CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY
Cages of mangy looking mutts. Pull back to reveal Creasy
on his hospital bed, IVs and all.
Rayburn sits nearby. He looks up as Creasy stirs, wakes
again. Creasy's eyes flicker to his friend, ask the
first question on his mind. Pinta...
Rayburn looks away, can't face his friend.
And suddenly,
Creasy knows.
CREASY
She's dead.
Isn't she?
Rayburn finally nods. And with that gesture, God takes
everything away. It might as well be the Old Testament.
And we are about to get Biblical.
Creasy turns his head, looks up at the ceiling.
RAYBURN
It was a fuck up. Someone hijacked the
drop. The kidnapper, his nephew got
killed.
CU of Creasy's face with his back to the room.
A
thousand yard stare. His eyes glaze over.
FLASHBACK
CU of Pinta looking up at Creasy. The camera ramps into
Pinta's smile. A small, but a sinificant moment in terms
of their connection.
The curtains are drawn tight. Slivers of light
illuminate the darkened room. Lisa sits on the end of
the bed humming a nursery rhyme. She rocks gently.
VOICE (V.O.)
You betrayed me. You killed my nephew
and took the money.
K&R; AGENT
No, not us...No we did not.

VOICE (V.O.)
Remember my words. Family is everything

The phone line goes dead.
VETERNARY CLINIC - DAY
Creasy still staring into space.
RAYBURN
She's dead Creasy.
Creasy blinks away a solitary tear.
Dogs barking constantly. Manzano walks the hall flanked
by a DOCTOR and a NURSE. A second policeman, Manzano's
adjutant, brings up the rear carrying two heavy binders.
MANZANO
She's dead. They fucked with 'the
process' and his nephew died.
DOCTOR
He suffered gunshot
wounds to the upper
extremity, chest and
abdomen. He has a
collapsed lung which
is stabilized,
injured his spleen,
which we may have to
remove and ruptured
his intestine. He's
on strict bedrest or
there's a good
chance we could lose
him.
NURSE
A strange man. He has much experience of
hospitals.
MANZANO
Did he say so?
NURSE
No.
But a nurse knows.
CUT TO:
MUGSHOT
Manzano and the adjutant have pulled chairs up alongside
the bed. The adjutant flips through one of the binders.
Each page holds a single MUGSHOT. Each time Creasy
shakes his head, the adjutant flips to the next photo.
Work in Progress 2/10/03
75.
MANZANO
Nothing?
Creasy shakes his head.
MANZANO
Excellent work by the way. Three men
dead. Only ten rounds fired.
Creasy shakes his head at the next shot.
MANZANO
If two of the men in my division could
shoot like that, I could get rid of the
other thirty-six.
One of the dogs starts to bark. Another. Soon ten of
them. The VET ASSISTANT enters, shouts at them to quiet.
Manzano ignores it, motions the adjutant to flip pages.
CREASY
What am I doing here?
MANZANO
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The
Judicial police will kill you. If they
can.
(re: book)
This page?
CREASY
No.
The adjutant reaches the last page.
Creasy shakes his
head.
MANZANO
You have a rather checkered past. Mr.
Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages
long.
CREASY
Am I a suspect?
MANZANO
No.
It would be convenient, but no.
As Manzano packs up his mugshot books...
CREASY
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen.
Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
Work in Progress 2/10/03
76.
MANZANO
All these photos you just saw were of
policemen. Sadly they're protected. La
Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
Manzano heads off.
As Creasy watches after him...
DOG PENS - NIGHT
Creasy sitting on the gurney, Rayburn buttons his shirt.
RAYBURN
(whispers)
Okay?
Creasy nods. Rayburn gets Creasy's arm over his
shoulder, eases him off the gurney till his feet hit the
floor.
Creasy winces, but the two of them start to walk out.
SUV - ROLLING - NIGHT
Rayburn constantly checking the rear view.
No pursuit in
sight. He looks over at Creasy.
RAYBURN
How do you feel?
Creasy looks over at him, finally shrugs.
CREASY
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
RAYBURN
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of
mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop
you right at the hospital.
Creasy's not really listening. He's been looking in the
passenger side view mirror. Nothing back there. Creasy
sits up. A bit of an effort.
CREASY
Got a thing I gotta do first.
Work in Progress 2/10/03

CREASY'S ROOM - DAWN
Bruno lets him in. Nothings been touched.
Creasy
retrieves his bullet from his shrine along
with the
'Jack', Marlboros, and New Testament. Puts
his few
possessions in a bag. MOVE WITH him as he
silently
crosses out into the hall, heads toward...
PINTA'S ROOM
He stands there a moment. His pain entirely his own.
And then he goes to Pinta's little desk, finds her school
notebook buried in a pile. He flips through it until he
finds...
Work in Progress 2/10/03
79.
The LICENSE PLATE NUMBER Pinta jotted for him. Then he
notices the notebook is really a diary. Every page
references her day to day relationship with Creasy. "I
love you Creasy Bear." He hears soft footsteps. Creasy
turns.
Lisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown, her eyes
drilling through Creasy.
LISA
(softly)
You let them take her.
She loved you and
you let them take her.
Creasy just blinks at her as the words blast through him.
LISA
Why are you here?
Why didn't you die?
CREASY
Because...
(shrugs)
I was already dead.
Eyes brimming, Lisa has no more words.
But Creasy comes
bearing cold comfort.
CREASY
I want you
to know something.
(a
beat)
I'm going
to kill them. Anyone who opens
their eyes
at me.
Lisa doesn't answer, but the connection between them is
suddenly monumental. Finally, Creasy looks away. He
picks up Pinta's battered, old TEDDY BEAR.
LISA
Creasy...
He turns, but she doesn't look back at him.
LISA
Kill them, Creasy.
Creasy nods.
He will.
As he continues away...
LISA (CONT'D)
Kill them all.
SUV - NEAR RAMOS - MEXICO CITY - DAWN
Rayburn looks over his shoulder, sees Creasy walking down
the street. Clutching a teddy bear.
Creasy gets in the car.
Rayburn drives.
RAYBURN
You'll be Stateside by suppertime.
No answer.
Finally, as Rayburn lights a cigarette...
CREASY
I'm going to need help, Ray.
Rayburn grinds out the cigarette he just lit, knows what
just was asked. Creasy needs help unleashing a plague.
Work in Progress 2/10/03
81.
RAYBURN
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day
the shape you're in. Unless you stop
bleeding you should have your spleen
removed.
CREASY
Yes or no?
RAYBURN
(after a beat)
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave
that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Creasy reaches into a pocket, hands Rayburn a hand
written list. Rayburn reads, his eyes widening.
RAYBURN
Jesus, Creasy. You're talking war.
The surface breaks as Creasy enters the water
wearing a
red T-shirt to hide the bandages. He begins
a slow
laborious stroke.
A pale attempt at getting
back into
shape. A ribbon of
maroon trails him through
the water.
LOCATION*
Fluorescents flicker on. A Fiat up on the hydraulic
lift. A section of the garage is portioned off by heavy
steel sheeting with a padlocked door.
One of the two men unlocks it.
Creasy and Rayburn enter.
PARTITION
Three long steel tables.
Covered with weapons.
RAYBURN
Candy store. Every town in Mexico has
one if you know what door to bang on.
Creasy stops by the pistols.
CREASY
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
RAYBURN
I know it's old fashioned, but it's
reliable. Like us.
Work in Progress 2/10/03

Next he's looking at grenades.
He hefts two different
choices.
CREASY
I need less than standard packing. Can
you knock up a case for fifteen of each?
He picks up a double barrel shotgun, checks the line of
it. He flicks open the breach, snaps it shut.
CREASY
(indicating)
Cut the stock here. The barrel here.
Make sure you file it smooth.
(looks around)
Rocket launchers?
RAYBURN
Different door. Not far from here.
JUMP CUTS of the following being loaded into a bag: .45
Colt, ammo, clips, bodyarmor (the kind you wear under

OVER TELEPHONE RINGING
AFI OPERATION CENTER - MEXICO CITY - DAY
Manzano, Rosanna, and technicians are listening to voice
analysis tapes of various kidnappers. They're
struggling. Rosanna hands the piece of paper with the
license plate number to Manzano.
MANZANO
He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death
before he can do anything.
ROSANNA
He sounded strong to me.
Stronger than
we are.
Rosanna pauses.
ROSANNA
Because he's outside. Because he's not
tied to the same system we are.
MANZANO
We did voice analysis of the last five
high profile kidnappings, including the
little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'.
Listen to this.
Manzano plays back a recording of the Kidnapper.
VOICE
"I used to run through the streets of
Neza because I was scared of being fucked
with. I swore one day I would cross the
street walking. Now I walk."
ROSANNA
He's protected by La Hermanidad.
MANZANO
I know this.
Your point?
ROSANNA
Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is
he could be very valuable to us.
Rosanna waits for a response.
None.
Work in Progress 2/10/03
84.
ROSANNA
Then what do you have to lose?
MANZANO
It's a moral issue. On one hand you're
cleaning up the bad guys, but in another
way we are feeding the problem that
produces bad guys.
Finally deciding, Manzano turns, holds out his hand.
As
Rosanna hands him the paper with the partial license
written on it.,
FIAT 500 - DAY
Jorge does as he's told. Suddenly the Sig comes down
hard. WHACK! As Jorge's vision explodes...
FIAT 500 - DAY
Still in the driver's seat, Jorge wakes. The first thing
he sees is that his hands are taped to the steering wheel
with his pudgy white fingers exposed. He is naked,
reminiscent of the 18 year old in the opening sequence.
CREASY
Can you hear me?
Jorge nods, the pain in his head blinding.
CREASY
I am going to ask questions. If you
don't answer, fully and truthfully, you
will suffer much more than you have to.
Creasy opens Pinta's notebook to a blank page near the
end. He clicks open a pen.
Creasy presses in the car's cigarette lighter.
Then he opens a buck knife.
Jorge winces at the sound of
the blade locking.
CREASY (CONT'D)
I'm going to cut your fingers off.
One
by one. If I have to.
The cigarette lighter pops back out.
CREASY
That's to cauterize the stubs.

Holy sweet Jesus... Sweat drips down Jorge's forehead.
He tries to master his fear. Swallows dry.
JORGE
Do you know who I am?
CREASY
Who are you?
JORGE
I am the President of La Hermanidad.
Without warning Creasy reaches up with the buck knife, a
flash of steel.
The big man howls, his left ear suddenly missing, starts
an epic struggle, practically breaking the wheel off the
steering column. He is like a bucking Rhinoceros.
He howls as Creasy sprays his face with pepper spray.
GUARDIA DE SEGUIDAD - SUNSET
A knock. GUARDIAN TWO steps over, carries a pistol.
He
slides back a speakeasy slot to reveal our tattooed
Guardian.
GUARDIAN TWO
Hola!
GUARDIA DE SEGUIDAD - SUNSET
As the butt of the shotgun makes contact with Guardian
Two's mouth. Blood spouts as his front teeth are smashed
in.
As he raises his hands to his face, the pistol he holds
discharges into the ceiling. Guardian One watches as
Creasy clubs him again in the head.
Frightened footsteps running on the other side of a
plywood wall. A female voice yelling from the other
room. Creasy gauges their whereabouts.
BOOM!
Creasy fires into the wall.
Wall explodes.
Guardian Three freezes mid stride.
It's a tough looking
woman in her 40's.
The three guardians stand facing the wall. Hands bound
with tape or cuffed. Naked (like our 18 year old) other
than their dirty skivvies.
Creasy holds up a picture of Pinta.
An I.D. picture
taken from her schoolbook.
CREASY
Tell me about the girl.
All three look...and with a strange defiant arrogance.
GUARDIAN ONE
Who the fuck's that?
BOOM! BOOM!
Creasy kills Guardian One.
INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:
The two Guardians each bound in two different rooms.
Both have their eyes taped shut. Creasy interrogates
Guardian Two.

pocket as he lies on the floor.
CREASY
What's the PIN number?
GUARDIAN TWO
The what?
CREASY
The number you use at the bank machine.
GUARDIAN TWO
Four-seven-four-seven.
CREASY
Who killed her? You?

CREASY
Don't lie to me.
GUARDIAN TWO
The boss did or his brother.
CREASY
Who's the boss?
GUARDIAN TWO
We don't know! We never see his face!
We have to wait in the other room. He
was screaming to the girl that...

...his nephew was killed in the exchange.
And the money was stolen.
CREASY
What money?

CREASY

The white tiled room we saw Pinta held in.
The door
opens and Guardian Three leads Creasy in.
FEMALE GUARDIAN
He was screaming about the money and his
dead nephew. He threw the little girl
against the wall.
The Female Guardian points. Creasy steps over.
There's
a smear of BLOOD against the wall.
FEMALE GUARDIAN
She fell. She wasn't moving. They threw
her body in the trunk of the car and
drove away.
FLASHBACK: Guardian's POV through window. We glimpse
through a dirty window, Pinta's body being put into a car
trunk.

telling the truth. Lost. And the sound that snaps him
out of it... A GIRL CRYING. And Creasy is suddenly
moving down...

After the sound.
He kicks open a door.

MANZANO'S OFFICE - AFI HQ - NIGHT
A beehive. Cops. Photos of dead kidnappers on the wall:
Jorge and Sandri. Sandri emasculated, one hand missing.
Jorge behind the wheel, fingers stubs and a missing ear.
ADJUTANT

badly. Sandri and Jorge were prime
suspects in twelve kidnappings in the

Manzano studies the photo of Jorge.

MANZANO
Whoever did this was methodical,
unafraid. Was Jorge's mugshot in the
photos we showed Creasy?
ADJUTANT
No, I checked. But right
after Sandri
was shot, a girlfriend of
his was found
naked, hysterical in the
street. She
said it was a man fitting
Creasy's
description who shot him.
MANZANO
Mr. Creasy was, and maybe is again, a
very lethal human being.
ADJUTANT
You don't seem very surprised?
Manzano looks at his Adjutant, pleased with his
perception. But he isn't sharing.
MANZANO
What's surprising these days?
An AFI agent brings over a plate of red shredded chicken.
Manzano takes a bite, moans in pleasure.
MANZANO

Manzano watches as...
Rayburn sits at a steel chair, bolted to the floor.
Rayburn's eyes are closed. In meditation. Then, slowly,
his arms extend out to the sides. Manzano is curious as,
slower still, Rayburn extends both hands out in front of
him, palms up. Must be a Zen thing.
Then, both MIDDLE FINGERS are extended. With eyes still
closed, Rayburn mouths 'fuck you'. Manzano bursts a
laugh.

Manzano enjoys another bite, then...
MANZANO
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
RAYBURN
You just said it. He's my friend.
Nothing else to say.

I read the file. You and Creasy have
seen quite a bit together.
RAYBURN
Two tourists who never went home.
MANZANO
You helped him get this job.
RAYBURN
That's what friends do.
MANZANO
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you,
others will do it as well. Their
facilities are as good as my own, if not
better.
RAYBURN
I can take care of myself.
MANZANO
You and Creasy both. A two man army

were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt
down elite Iraqi military commanders.

MANZANO
What happened to him?
What happened to
Creasy?
Rayburn flinches at some bitter memory.
RAYBURN
None of your business. Or mine for that
matter. I got nothing more to say.
MANZANO
This is my jurisdiction. I want these
men as much as Creasy does.
RAYBURN
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend,
than ten years of your courts and
tribunals. So stay out of his way.
MANZANO
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can.
He's going to lead me to the 'The
Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly.
But I'd like to understand him. Give me
that.
RAYBURN
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to
you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a
number. One more dead.
MANZANO
What was she to Creasy then?
RAYBURN
Light. At the end of a long, dark
tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was
alright to live again.
MANZANO
And they took that away.
RAYBURN
A man can be an artist in anything.
Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if
his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is
death. And he's about to paint his
masterpiece.
The words sink in.
Manzano understands their magnitude.

GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - MORNING
An elderly couple eating lunch. The HUSBAND looks over
at a knock on the door. He stands, answers it. Creasy
slides in, eases the door shut behind him. Gun in hand.
CREASY
I'm not here to hurt you. I need to
borrow your house and your car. Are you
the proud owners of the Coupe deVille?
GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY
Creasy has just finished taping the old couple to two
chairs.
CREASY
If you promise to speak softly and not to
shout, I won't have to tape your mouths.
The old man looks to his wife, then back to Creasy.
Nods.
The old man watches as Creasy opens he canvas bag, pulls
out two metal tubes that he screws together. It's a
ROCKET LAUNCHER. Next he pulls out a cone-shaped
missile. The old man is starting to look curious.
CREASY
Did you know you have a dishonest
policeman living in your neighborhood?
Creasy depresses the fins on the missile and slides it
back into the tube.
OLD MAN
I know of you. You're the American. The
bodyguard who's killing the kidnapper.
Creasy doesn't answer, steps into the center of the room.
OLD MAN
In the church, they say to forgive.
CREASY
Forgiveness is between them and God.
It's my job to arrange the meeting.
Creasy looks back and forth between two shuttered windows
and in a line to the wall with a household Catholic
alter. Christ on the cross sits front and center.
CREASY
Do you have an old blanket you don't care
about? I don't want to burn that wall.
GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY
A figure rises, framed in the window.
And Pinta stands beside him.

Eyes widening as the first rocket streaks toward them.
The driver stands on the brakes. The car explodes, is

CREASY
You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a

DINING ROOM - EVENING
Samuel eats dinner silently. Lisa just stares into
space, nursing a vodka. Even great marriages cannot
survive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death.
The door opens and they expect to see Maria with the
deserts. Creasy enters and sits at the table like a
dinner guest.
CREASY
(to Samuel)
I'm going to talk to your wife. If you
move or say one word, I'll kill you.
He takes a Colt Officer model .45 semi-automatic pistol
out of his waistband and lays it on the table in
preparation for something, we don't know what. He turns
to Lisa.
CREASY
I'm going to tell you a story. Your
lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him
talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million
into his U.S. bank account. Colonel
Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He
hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5
million. If my arithmetic is correct it
means $5 million remains.
Creasy looks to Samuel.
CREASY
Your husband magically had five million
deposited in a U.S. bank account last
Friday.
Lisa's eyes never leave Creasy's...trying to discern
whether this is true or not.
CREASY
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
LISA
Planned what?
Work in Progress 2/10/03
109.
CREASY
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for
Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm
sure he thought she'd sit there for three
days eating pizza and watching TV. It
didn't work out that way. Everything got
fucked up when I killed the cops and
Tazinari saw an opportunity.
Lisa screams.
Creasy gestures with a finger to his lips.
CREASY
On the surface it was low risk and high
return. This was the third autosequestra
Jordan had organized for clients. The
other two succeeded.
Samuel looks to Lisa.
SAMUEL
Our lifestyle was in jeopardy. My pain
and weakness only fueled your anger and
determination. I wasn't sure about
whether to go through with it or not.
Then I woke up one day and it was done.
(beat)
Jordan was supposed to take care of it.
Through all of the above, Creasy removes the special
bullet held in the seam of his wallet. The misfire.
He
empties the other cartridges from his gun.
Lisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional
outburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood
from his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms
beneath his. He appears strong and decisive for the
first time.
Creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the
magazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's
eyes.
CREASY
A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells
the truth. And the truth will set you
free.
Creasy hands Samuel the gun.
CREASY
In many ways I think this bullet should
be shared between you and Lisa.

Creasy exits the room. Samuel kisses Lisa on the
forehead and exits onto the terrace.
A GUNSHOT.
DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Lisa just sits.
Where will she find air to breathe?
Back on Rosanna. We see she's sitting in the AFI
Operations Center amongst Technicians, surveillance and
listening devices, and Manzano.
We can hear the interior of a family house, kids, a
frustrated mother, a Mexican soap playing in the B.G.,
over speakers.
TECHNICIAN
(to Manzano)
We got the whole place wiretapped. But
no males that sound anything like 'The
Dreamer'.
MANZANO
He'll show.
Manzano is carrying a 8" X 10" digital blow up of a
handsome Mexican John Gotti type in some nightclub
environment.
ROSANNA
Who's that?
MANZANO
He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got
into the house on the pretext of giving
cholera shots. We had to inject the
whole Barrio. We bugged the house and
stole the picture of him. Manzano looks
at Rosanna. Now's the time to really
pressure him. Lets publish his picture
in tomorrow's edition.
Rosanna understands the consequences makes light of them.
ROSANNA
So how are going to recipricate?
Manzano discreetly slides his hands up her crotch.
CUT TO:
Rosanna in her apartment in the dark.
A tear trails her
cheek.
CU of the proofsheet of the next day's newspaper.
The
Boss' picture, full frame.
CLOSED RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The OWNER watches nervously as
Creasy approaches wearing
a wool CAP. A pale attempt at
disguising his identity.
There's a newspaper folded on
his dais, more photos of
Creasy, his dead targets, the
story of his vendetta.
CREASY
I'm looking for Rosanna Guerrero.
OWNER
This way.
Empty restaurant, chairs
on tables. An
exterior
streetlight illuminates
the darkness.
The owner leads
him down a row of empty
booths. Creasy
slows, stops as
he sees the only person
waiting for him
is Manzano. As
Manzano smiles.
MANZANO
(holds up paper)
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's
what the papers have named you.
CREASY
It's what you and Rosanna named me.
Right?
Work in Progress 2/10/03
113.
MANZANO
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens
from now on does so with my permission.
(smiles)
Really. You won't find a better carne
asada in all of Mexico.
The table is covered in an arrangement of the best food
you will ever find in Mexico. Creasy sits.
MANZANO
(laughs at himself)
The last few days may represent the best
police work of my life.
CREASY
What do you want?
MANZANO
The same thing as you. Except, my reach
isn't as long as yours. My father was a
policemen, did you know that?
CREASY
I don't know shit about you.
MANZANO
He was one of the original founders of
'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it
represented good not evil.
Manzano smiles; he likes Creasy.
MANZANO
He was murdered. And now here I am.
Trying to honor his memory. Hamstrung by
bureaucracy and corruption. The
organization that he began now protects
criminals at the highest level where I
would need a Presidential finding in
order to expose it...or you.
The WAITER steps over; Manzano waves him off.
MANZANO
My family lives in Miami.
Because of the
death threats.
CREASY
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
Work in Progress 2/10/03
114.
MANZANO
It galls me to watch you. You can do as
much in days as I can in years. Men like
the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of
everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
CREASY
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to
death?
Manzano laughs again.
Genuine.
Creasy cracks him up.
MANZANO
My country needs justice. Proper
justice. Gunning men down in the street
only feeds the violence. They need to
be brought to trial. Dealt with
properly.
Then people will respect the law. When
they see it works.
CREASY
So you are going to talk me to death.
MANZANO
You walk out and deal justice. You're
what I wish I could be.
(another laugh, then a beat)
The policemen who kills you, his family
will have all they want.
CREASY
Then I hope the one who gets me has got
lots of kids. What do you want?
MANZANO
I want to arrest you for murder! I want
to shake your hand and reload your gun!
I want to kill my pride and give you my
blessing.
CREASY
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys
were up to something. Are you two
fucking?
MANZANO
No, but I have to admit I thought about
it.
CREASY
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card
belongs to. Name and address.
Work in Progress 2/10/03
115.
MANZANO
You have no interest in making things
easy, do you?
CREASY
I'm not... easy.
Manzano reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a folded
PIECE OF PAPER and a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE. He hands the
bottle out first.
MANZANO
Percodan.
I imagine you need handfuls by
now.
Creasy makes no move to take it. Manzano sighs, sets it
down in front of him. Regarding the paper...
MANZANO
Account belongs to a woman we think is
The Dreamer's girlfriend. Reina Rosas,
who is 8 months pregnant.
Creasy holds his hand out.
Manzano hesitates.
MANZANO
The plan is the girlfriend will lead you
to the Boss. You'll lead me, and I'll
arrest him. Agreed?
Creasy doesn't respond. Finally Manzano gives him the
paper, a mimeographed mugshot, and address scrawled on it.
Creasy stands. As he scoops up the pills. Creasy starts
out.
MANZANO
Creasy...
(Creasy turns)
I'd have liked to have known you under
different circumstances.
CREASY
Off the top of my head, I don't know what
they could've been.
As Creasy departs...
FADE TO BLACK.

CREASY'S VOICE
Romans chapter 13:4 - therefore whoever
resists authority will bring judgment on
themselves. Now it is time to awake out
of sleep for our salvation is nearer than
we first believed.
HALLWAY - DAY
The pregnant woman, Reina Rosas, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER
as Creasy fills the space behind her. Creasy follows as
she runs.
LIVING ROOM
Creasy faces Reina, heavily pregnant. Silence. Two
other kids hide behind her. Suddenly the wall next to
Creasy explodes in a hail of bullets.
We realize Creasy caught one round in the chest. He's
down on one knee... uses the shotgun as a crutch. Reina
is screaming.
Hear a door torn open. Creasy
moves to the sound.
A
MAN has run out the back...
Creasy pops the clutch... straight into a small house...
taking whole walls of cardboard... to the back brick
wall... The 'Man' is pinned violently between the car and
the wall.
CUT TO:
BARRIO
Creasy, shotgun in one hand, the injured Man in the
other... walks through the barrio... a small crowd is
yelling, "Creasy, MAN ON FIRE" (in Spanish: Hombre en
Fuego).
LIVING ROOM - REINA ROSAS HOUSE - DAY
The Man badly broken and bleeding lies on the floor, flex-
cuffed. Reina screams at Creasy. Creasy's popping
Percodan's. The hysteria is peaking. Creasy chambers a
round and shoots man through left knee. Screams then
silence.
CREASY
Reina Rosas.
REINA
Si.
CREASY
How do you contact 'the Boss'?
Reina hesitates.
Creasy chambers another round and holds the gun to man's
right knee.
REINA
We page him and he calls back on this
cell phone.

CREASY
What is his name?
REINA
Daniel.
CREASY
Daniel what?
He pulls the hammer back.
REINA
Daniel Rosas Sanchez.
CREASY
So you're married to him? And this looks
remarkably like his brother.
Creasy looks to man semiconscious on the floor.
She nods
CREASY
What is his name?
REINA
Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.
Technician listens into the living room conversation and
speaks to Manzano over the radio.

What do we do?
MANZANO (V.O.)
Do nothing. Prepare yourself for an
incoming call.
AFI GROUP
congregating around maps, and a "Triggerfish," a means of
tracing the location of a cell phone.
Cell phone ringing.
Creasy pauses -- picks up the cell.
CREASY
Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I
want to negotiate.
DANIEL
Mr. Creasy.

CREASY
I want you.
Several beats of silence.
We can hear Daniel's
breathing.
DANIEL
How much do you want?
CREASY
It's non-negotiable.
DANIEL
Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?
CREASY
I told you, non-negotiable.
Daniel hangs up.

AFI TRAILER
MANZANO listening.
MANZANO
Damn.
CUT TO:
LIVING ROOM
Cell phone ringing.
CREASY
Yeah.
Daniel has a different attitude, a lot more amenable.
He
tries to speak to Creasy very logically about a very
illogical subject.
DANIEL
The most important thing in life is
family. And there you are. You have my
family. What do you want?
CREASY
I want you.
DANIEL
This is not possible. But in that house
I have money. If I tell you where --

Your brother wants to talk to you.
Holding the shotgun with his right hand, Creasy holds the
phone to Aurillio's ear.
AURILLIO
Daniel?
BOOM! Creasy shoots Aurillio in his right kneecap.
As
Aurillio HOWLS in agony...
CREASY
Listen to me. Listen! I'm going to take
your family apart piece by piece.
The line goes dead.
Hang up.
Creasy's ready to explode.
REINA
Under the sink. We have money under the
sink. Six million dollars. It's wet but
good.
The phone begins to ring again.
Creasy answers.
CREASY
Yeah.
(silence)
Yes.
DANIEL
Listen!
I will give you a life for a
life.
CREASY
What do you mean?
DANIEL
Her life for your life.
Creasy's confused.
CREASY
Whose life?
Creasy's confused.
DANIEL
The girl's.
Pinta's.
CREASY
You're a liar. Pinta's dead.

DANIEL
I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth
nothing. She is alive.
A long beat.
CREASY
I want proof of life.
What did she call
her bear?
DANIEL hangs up.
Aurillio moans on the floor. Reina says the rosary. The
kids cry. The phone rings. Creasy listens, not capable
of speaking.
DANIEL
Creasy.
She calls the bear 'Creasy
Bear.'
Time stands still for Creasy.
Words evaporate.
Liquid
film in Creasy's eyes.
CLOSE UP of Creasy's shocked face. He pulls down his
shirt collar. Bubbles of blood form and reform over his
chest wound as the maroon spreads across his chest and
stomach.
CREASY
Okay.
Where?

Vans on the move.
Team Leader, radios.

He cannot waste his ebbing strength.
