Deep midnight.  PAN slowly through the gloom of the
chamber.  Across unlit candles sitting half-melted in pools
of hardened wax;  Vincent's cloak draped across
the back of an empty chair;  a miniature of the Empire State
Building lying on its side.  Everything looks somehow
abandoned... lost in shadow... forlorn.  Under the darkened
window, Vincent's bed is empty.  We PUSH PAST into the
darkest corner of the chamber, where the blackness is
almost TOTAL...

EYES look out of the darkness.  Unblinking, cold, steady.
We MOVE IN on them slowly, and there in the deepest shadow
FIND Vincent seated, alone, hands locked beneath his chin,
staring out at the dark with an intensity that is almost
frightening.  We know just from looking at him that he has
been here for a long time, that he has not slept, will not
sleep.  His face is tense and terrible; behind his eyes
some ferocious power burns.

When he MOVES, it is abrupt, startling.  He strides across
his chamber, gathers up the cloak, every motion swift,
deliberate.  Under it all is a rage and grief of epic
proportions, barely held in check.  He exits.



Vincent strides through the tunnels, his cloak flowing
Behind him, his face stern.  The world below sleeps.
Vincent walks alone, haunted by his memories.



The shining black waters of the pool are full of STARS as
Vincent enters.  He stops on the bridge, stares down,
closes his eyes in pain, and sinks slowly to his knees.

DISSOLVE TO:



Cathy wakes from a restless sleep, sits up in bed, the
blankets tangled around her.  Her face is drawn, tired.
It's been a bad night.  All the nights have been bad
lately, since she said goodbye to Vincent.


2. WITH CATHY

as she drags herself out of bed, slips into a bathrobe.
Barefoot, she pads through the apartment to the front
door... but hesitates when she gets there.  It's been four
days since she said goodbye to Vincent; four days since
Bernie Spirko took the photographs that shattered their
dreams forever; four days that she's risen expecting to
read the worst in the morning paper.  Every day it gets
harder to open that door.

Hating it, dreading it, but knowing that it has to be done,
Cathy steels herself, undoes the chain, opens the front
door.  The paper is there on the threshold.



3. CLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER

The New York Sentinel.  The headline screams at us as Cathy
bends to pick it up.  DA'S DEMON LOVER IN MURDER SPREE, the
banner reads.  Beneath, a subhead warns Police promise full
investigation.  It's the lead story, slugged with Bernie
Spirko's byline.  The rest of the front page is taken up
with photographs.  A head shot of Cathy, a grotesque
artist's rendering of Vincent at his most bestial, and
several of Spirko's graphic action shots (from "What Rough
Beast") depicting Vincent in the act of ripping apart Gus
and Vic.  There are no other stories; the whole front page
of the newspaper is devoted to Spirko's photographs and
story.


4. RESUME CATHY

She stands in the doorway, holding the newspaper, almost
numb with shock.  We can see that's she torn up inside.
She HEARS a door open, and looks up. 

















5. A LITTLE GIRL is standing in the door of the apartment at
the other end of Cathy's hall.  Cathy forces a smile.

CATHERINE
			Hi, Amy...

But the girl doesn't reply, and suddenly her AMY'S MOTHER
appears in the doorway behind her.  She gives Cathy a look
that tells all, WHISPERS something to the child and pulls
her inside, then pauses to look at Cathy with fear and
loathing, before she SLAMS her door behind her.

Cathy fights to hold back the tears as she takes the
newspaper, and retreats back into her apartment.


DISSOLVE TO:



Heartsick and tired, Cathy drags herself through the front
doors of the DA's office, and finds a small battalion of
REPORTERS camped out waiting for her;  newspapermen,
photographers, television news crews.  They descend on her
the moment she appears.  Cameras FLASH, minicams begins to
roll, microphones are thrust into her face, she's
surrounded, jostled.  Voices fling questions at her from
every side, dialogue OVERLAPPING.

   TV REPORTER				  NEWSPAPERMAN 
Miss Chandler! What about the     How many men has 
Sentinel story?                   he killed for you?

   TABLOID REPORTER                   WOMAN REPORTER 
We'll pay ten thousand cash       What did your father

   TV REPORTER                        TABLOID REPORTER 
How did you feel the first time   There's big bucks if
you saw him tear someone apart?   you get us a picture.

Moreno's called for your          Was Vincent the one who
resignation.  Are you going       slashed up your face?
to fight for it?                  you think he's human?

Cathy is in SHOCK for a moment as the reporters close in
around her.  She looks from face to face, terrified, in
pain.  She tries to move through them, but they only press
closer.  Other employees in the DA'S office just stand and
watch, their faces cold.  As the questions get uglier,
Cathy finally covers her ears and fights her way through
the press, shoving and struggling, until she reaches the
sanctuary of Joe Maxwell's office.



Cathy slams the door behind her, shutting out the 
Reporters.  She's close to tears


CATHERINE
			Joe, you've got to help me...


She stops suddenly when Joe looks up from the morning
Sentinel spread across his desk.  There's no warmth or
affection in his face.


JOE
			It's a little late for that, don't
			you think?
				(accusatory)
			I trusted you.  How long were
			you going to keep up the lies,
			Chandler?


Cathy reels back under the unexpected assault.  Joe
rises from behind his desk and comes up at her.  He grabs
a fistful of the newspaper, thrusts it in her face.


JOE
			Look at these pictures.  Look
			at them!  Didn't it ever make
			you sick?  These were human
			beings, damn it... which is
			more than I can say for your
			boyfriend!

CATHERINE
			You don't understand.  Vincent
			isn't like that... Spirko
			made him out...

JOE
			Vincent's a monster...

CATHERINE
			No... Joe, please... don't...

JOE
			He's an animal.  And what does
			that make you, Radcliffe?


Cathy, shell-shocked by this verbal assault, cringes back
against the door as Joe grabs her shoulders and begins to
shake her, SHOUTING into her face.


JOE
				(shouting)
			What does that make you, huh?
			What does that make you?



Cathy turns away, covers her ears, and SCREAMS, and we



SMASH CUT TO:




as she sits bolt-upright in bed, SCREAMING, covered with
cold sweat, her heart triphammering in her chest.
Everything up to now has been a DREAM, a nightmare of what
awaits her with Spirko's story hits prints.

Cathy realizes where she is.  She SHIVERS, hugs herself.
For a moment she looks too drained and exhausted to move.
We CRANE UP, away from the small, huddled figure in the
tangled bedclothes, and



DISSOLVE TO:




Showered and dressed, Cathy looks a little better, but the
strain and the loneliness are still apparent on her face.
She carries a steaming mug of COFFEE as she steps out onto
her balcony for a breath of morning air.  She stands for a
moment looking out over the city.  Then her gaze lights on
her newly-planted rosebush in its planter.  The bush is
in full bloom now, covered with a profusion of both RED and
WHITE ROSES, all mixed together in a tangles of leaves,
thorns, and branches.  It reminds her of Vincent.  She
heads back inside with a bittersweet look on her face.

In the dining room, Cathy puts down her cup, stuffs a
shoulder bag full of case files, and strides toward the
door... and hesitates, just like in the dream.  It takes
all her strength to open the door.



10. OMITTED




No paper on the stoop.  Shouldering her bag, Catherine
locks her door, starts down the hall.  Then the door to
the other apartment opens, and there's the little girl
again, looking at her with those same wide eyes.  Cathy
stops suddenly, nervously.  She has to force the smile.

CATHERINE
			Hi, Amy...

The little girl just stares, until suddenly her mother
appears behind her.  But this time the woman smiles warmly,
and speaks playfully to the child.

AMY'S MOTHER
				(to little girl)
			What's the matter, cat got your
			tongue?  Say good morning to
			Cathy.

AMY
				(very shy)
			Good morning, Cathy...

OFF Cathy's relieved smile, we
		

CUT TO:



The stars are fading, and the black waters shimmer with a
hint of blue.  Dawn is coming to the world above, and we
see its first glimmerings reflected dimly in the pool.
Vincent has not moved in all these hours.  Father enters
behind him, leaning heavily on his cane.

FATHER
			Vincent.  Your bed hadn't been
			slept in, I was worried.  Have
			you been here all night?

Vincent does not look back at Father.

VINCENT
			Catherine dreamt.  I could
			taste... the nightmare...

Troubled, Father struggles for a reply.  He sees the water,
tries to frame a hopeful comment.

FATHER
			Dawn...

VINCENT
			No... only its reflection...

Father hears all the anguish in Vincent's voice. He
puts a comforting hand on Vincent's shoulder.

FATHER
			It's been four days... long
			enough to hope.  Perhaps this
			man reached into his heart,
			and... realized the harm his
			story would do... reconsidered. 

VINCENT
			Perhaps...
				(beat)
			But as long as I go above... as
			long as Catherine is in my
			life... there will always be
			another man waiting. . . with a
			camera or a notepad or a gun.
			And one day, one of them will
			not... reconsider.

Father struggles with that, but can't deny the truth.

FATHER
			It was a dream, Vincent... you
			knew that from the start... this
			is your world...

VINCENT
			No, Father...
				(rises)
			This is my tomb.

He walks off into the dark, leaving Father alone.

CUT TO:


Cathy sticks her head into Joe Maxwell's office.

CATHERINE
			Rita said you wanted to see...

She stops suddenly.  Joe is behind his desk, reading the
morning Sentinel, just as he was in her dream.  He looks
up, his face grave, worried.

JOE
			Yeah.  You seen this morning's
			Sentinel?
CATHERINE
			No...

JOE
			You better sit down.


Cathy steps inside, shuts the door.


CATHERINE
			Just tell me.

JOE
			Cath, this is...

CATHERINE
				(shrill, on edge)
			Just let me see...



She strides over to his desk, grabs the newspaper, and
stares at the headline in SHOCK.



14. CLOSE ON THE HEADLINE

The major headline reads:  MISSING REPORTER FOUND MURDERED,
over a grainy photograph of police carrying a body,
concealed in a body bag, toward a morgue wagon.  Under the
photo, the slugline reads: Mutilated body of SENTINEL
reporter Bernie Spirko washes ashore in Brooklyn. 


15. RESUME CATHY

as she REACTS to the news.  It's not what she had expected,
not what she had feared, but in a way, it's just as bad.
We see the doubt in her eyes.


JOE
			You want to talk about it?

CATHERINE
			There's nothing to talk about.


Cathy glances away, unable to look Joe in the eyes.




as Vincent, roaring in a bestial frenzy, looms over Spirko,
about to kill the cringing reporter.  The cut should be
hard, fast, almost SUBLIMINAL.

17. RESUME JOE'S OFFICE

JOE
			What's going on, Radcliffe?


Cathy shakes her head, answers softly.


CATHERINE
			... nothing...

It's tearing her up inside to lie to Joe; he baffled.

JOE
			How come I don't believe you?

CATHERINE
				(sharply)
			I can't help what you believe

JOE
			Hey, Cath, time out.  I'm on your
			side, remember?

He gets up and comes around the desk, close to her.

JOE
			I don't know what's going on here,
			but if you need a lawyer... or
			a friend...

CATHERINE
			I know, Joe.  I... appreciate
			that...

JOE
			I gotta tell you... as a lawyer
			and a friend... if you've got any
			idea why Spirko got knifed, you
			ought to --


Cathy picks up on something and reacts, INTERRUPTING.


CATHERINE
			Knifed?

JOE
			Yeah, the autopsy said...
				(beat, hesitates)
			Cath, I'm not sure you need to
			hear this.

CATHERINE
			Go on, Joe...
JOE
			Coroner says he was killed with
			a double-edged blade... 'bout yo
			long...
				(indicates with his
				 hands)
			... razor sharp, like some kind
			of surgical tool.  Entry wound
			was in the lower abdomen, but
			he was... sliced open clear up...

Joe hesitates, looking at Cathy's face, a strange, taut
mixture of horror and relief:  Vincent didn't kill Spirko.


JOE
			You sure you're okay?

CATHERINE
			Yes.  I think I am...

CUT TO:




A glum Father tells MOUSE of his concern for Vincent.

FATHER
			He feels trapped now.  His home
			has become a prison, cutting him
			off from the world above.  He
			needs the night sky, the stars...

Father is groping for something -- anything -- to help
Vincent in his hour of darkness.  But Mouse, with his
innocent wisdom, cuts right to the heart.


MOUSE
			Not stars.  Needs Catherine.


Father gives him a look.  Both men know it's true.  Very
wearily, father shakes his head.


FATHER
			How I wish I could... make
			it so.  Everything I say and do
			seems so small... still, we must
			help... however we can.

Mouse listens, understands.  They cannot touch the real
cause of Vincent's grief, but as his friends, they must
do whatever small things they can.
MOUSE
			Okay good, okay fine.  Bring down
			the sky.
				(thoughtful)
			Something better than the mirror
			pool.  Sun and stars and stuff,
			all alive, moving.
				(doubtful)
			Hard.  Harder than hard.
				(determined)
			Mouse will work on it.

Father brightens slightly and puts a hand on Mouse's
shoulder in thanks.  JAMIE enters, her MINER'S HELMET
cocked rakishly, carrying a thick manila envelope.

JAMIE
			One of the helpers sent this down.
				(to Mouse)
			What's going on?


She hands Father the envelope, looks curiously at Mouse.
As Jamie and Mouse talk, Father SLITS OPEN the envelope.


MOUSE
				(very serious)
			Making plans.

JAMIE
			What kind of plans?

MOUSE
			Secret plans.

Mouse EXITS.  Jamie looks curiously after him, then back at
Father just as he glances at the contents of the packet.
He stares, unable to hide his REACTION.


JAMIE
			Father?  Are you all right?  What
			is it?

Father recovers his poise, stuffs the contents back inside
the concealing envelope.


FATHER
			Just a...bit of news... nothing
			To concern you.

Jamie doesn't know quite what to make of this.  He sits
heavily, lost in thought, almost as if he's forgotten Jamie
is there.  She waits a beat, SHRUGS, and leaves.


No sooner has she gone, than the fear returns to Father's
face.  His hands TREMBLE just a little as he re-opens the
packet and slides out its contents, a file of 9x12 glossy
black-and-white photo blow-ups.  INTERCUT from the images
to Father's face as he begins to go through Spirko's
photographs, crystal clear enlargements of Vincent caught
in the act of ripping apart Gus and Vic.

FATHER
			Dear God...

His eyes are wide, horrified.  He looks at as many of the
enlargements as he can stomach, then shoves them away.
There's a handwritten note with them.  He opens it.

			666 Sutton Place
			  come alone
		   or see these published

The note is unsigned.

His face grim, Father picks up the first photograph and
holds it over a candle flame until it catches and begins
to BLACKEN.  As the photograph burns, we PUSH IN TIGHT on
the flames, and

ELLIOTT BURCH stands behind his desk, facing private
detective CLEON MANNING, a tall, slender, impeccably
attired black man, about 40.  Burch has a rolled up copy
of the Sentinel in his hand



ELLIOTT
			I hired you to get some answers

			So maybe you can tell me why I

MANNING
			Floaters are tough to find, Mr.

ELLIOTT
			What about the story he was

			Spirko information about Catherine

Manning looks distinctly uncomfortable at that one.


MANNING
			Problem is, Mr. Burch, that Spirko

			source...

ELLIOTT
			That's absurd!

MANNING
			I figured that much out for

ELLIOTT
			He must have left something

MANNING
			All gone.  We'll keep looking,

Manning gives an eloquent SHRUG.  Elliott controls himself,
sits down, thinks it over for a beat.

ELLIOTT
			I want to know everything that
			Spirko did last week.  Every place
			he went, everyone he talked to,
			every phone call he made.  I want

apartment.  The interior is dimly lit, silent, gloomy;
dust motes swim in a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT between the heavy
drapes, but otherwise there is no light,

PARACELSUS(O.S.)
			I'm here, Jacob.  I've been

22. REVERSE ANGLE

Father turns.  Paracelsus sits the high-back choir chair
in a corner of the room.  He has donned the golden mask,
but otherwise wears the clothing of the world above.


FATHER

			It had to be you.


PARACELSUS
			You always were a perceptive man,
			Jacob... in you own way.

			I trust that you enjoyed the

FATHER
			I burned them.



PARACELSUS
			Pity.  I thought they showed the
			boy in an... interesting light.
			But your appetite for truth was
			always... rather limited, as I
			recall.

FATHER
			There was nothing of truth in
			those pictures.

PARACELSUS
			The camera does not lie, Jacob.

			But not all of us are strong
			enough to look on the face of the
			Medusa, are we?


Father has grown impatient with this sparring.


FATHER
			You wanted me.  Well, I'm here.
			What is this all about?

PARACELSUS
			What it has always been about.
			you.  Me.  The child.

FATHER
			I will not allow you to publish
			those photographs...

PARACELSUS
			Ah.  And how do you propose to
			stop me, old friend?


Father's face is grim as he reaches inside his jacket with
a trembling hand and pulls out a PISTOL.  He aims it at
Paracelsus, pulls back with hammer with a CLICK.  The
alchemist seems only mildly surprised.


PARACELSUS
			I see.  So is this what it has
			come to in the end, all your fine
			talk of love and turning the other
			cheek?
				(shrug, smiles)
			Kill me then. You'll find me
			quite unarmed...


Paracelsus turns, walks to the window with calm
deliberation.  Father keeps him in his sights, but cannot
bring himself to shoot the man in the back.  Paracelsus
pulls back the drapes, flooding the room with SUNLIGHT.
Father must raise a hand to shield his eyes from the glare.
As he stands blinking, gun in hand, Paracelsus gazes out
over Manhattan, then turns back.

PARACELSUS
			Does the light offend your eyes?
			Forgive me.  You've spent too long
			in the dark, Jacob.  Perhaps we
			all have.

Father LOWERS the gun.  He cannot shoot;  both men know it
now.

FATHER

			What do you want, John?  It's more
			than my death... you might have
			had that a dozen times over.  For

He crosses to a ROLLTOP DESK, opens a drawer, removes
something from inside.

PARACELSUS
			It is time for the boy to claim
			his birthright...

In his hand Paracelsus fondles an antique LOCKET of solid
gold, with a golden chain.  Smiling, he holds it out to
Father.  His thumb presses the release, and the locket pops

deeply troubled, a thick MANILLA ENVELOPE on his lap.

CATHERINE
			Father... what are you doing here?
			Is something wrong?


Father seems almost dazed.


FATHER
			Yes... I... I...

He stares off into space.  Something has Father as troubled
as Cathy has ever seen him.

CATHERINE
			You'd better come inside.

Father NODS, gets up.  Cathy unlocks the door and he
follows here into the apartment.




Cathy puts down her things and looks at Father with
mounting concern.


CATHERINE
			Are you alright?  Can I get you

Wordlessly, Father gives her the envelope.  Cathy opens the

Up to this moment, Catherine thought the secret source was

Father removes the gold locket from the pocket of his suit,

old-fashioned cut, her face plain but pleasant.

in his street clothing.  Cathy stands close.



VINCENT
			Why would you ever consider such
			a thing?


FATHER
			To... to protect you...

			But Catherine convinced me you

Vincent looks from Cathy to Father.  He's troubled.


FATHER
			Please understand... no one ever
			wanted to lie to you, but... there
			some things that I thought you...
			you did not need to hear...


That's even more disturbing to Vincent, but the need to
understand is growing in him.  He goes to the point.


VINCENT
			Father, who was she?


For a moment Father has difficulty speaking as he struggles
With old memories, old emotions.


FATHER
			Her name was... Anne.  She was
			one of us... in the beginning...
			a good woman...

			One night... it was the

Father cannot continue, but Vincent has gotten the idea.



VINCENT
			Anna was the one who found me?



Father hesitates a long time, struggling with some inner
doubt.  But finally he shakes his head: no.



FATHER
			That was... only a story. You

			Anna was... your mother.



27. CLOSE ON VINCENT

SHOCKED, he struggles to digest this.  A few short words;
but they have ripped the underpinnings out from beneath
Vincent's world, and left him adrift.  A storm of
emotions passes across his face; a thousand questions
pass across his eyes.



VINCENT
			My...


Even the word is too much, the concept too overwhelming.
Vincent has to turn away, suddenly speechless.  He looks
at the locket, then back at Father.


28. RESUME


Father nods weakly.  Lost, stunned, Vincent looks at Cathy.


CATHY
			I told Father that you'd want to

A formless anger takes hold of Vincent.




VINCENT
			Why did...


There are so many questions.  Vincent hardly knows how
To frame them, or where to begin.


VINCENT
			All these years... you said...


Father knows what he said, so often and so long.  He

VINCENT

ELLIOTT
			Who's penthouse?


MANNING
			Good question.  The place was

ELLIOTT
			Isn't that a little irregular?


MANNING
			Yeah... but when you pay a year's
			rent in advance... at twice the
			normal rates... in gold... you're
			allowed to be a little irregular.


ELLIOTT considers all this, weighing the alternatives.



ELLIOTT

			Stake out the building.  I want

			hours a day.  Cameras, audio,
			phone taps, the works.


MANNING
			You got it.  You want to ring the

ELLIOTT thinks about it, doesn't like the idea.  Cathy's
Caught up in this somehow, and he's promised to keep her
Secrets.



ELLIOTT
			No.

			No.  Let's just... keep this

Manning nods.



CUT TO: 

as he finishes telling them about his meeting with
Paracelsus


FATHER

			his next attack may come...

Father gives a doubtful shake of the head.

MOUSE
				(with bravado)
			Only one man.  Mouse isn't scared.

PASCAL
			Maybe Mouse should be.

WILLIAM
			Paracelsus has always had his
			followers down below us...

FATHER
			And now he has made dangerous.
			allies in the world above as well...

PASCAL
			We have to change all the tunnel
			entrances...

FATHER
			John Pater discovered half of
			these tunnels.  He won't be fooled
			by a few false walls.

MOUSE
			Mouse can make more traps!  Ropes,
			chutes.  Wrong step...
				(loud clap)
			... up he goes!

FATHER
			He'd only cut through your ropes,
			Mouse.

WILLIAM
			How about deadfalls, pits... ?

Mouse gapes at him as if he's gone insane.  Pascal is
bothered too, and speaks up.

PASCAL
			Someone might get hurt.

William touches his ample stomach, as if the wound
he received from Paracelsus was still fresh.

WILLIAM
			This is Paracelsus we're
			talking about.  He murdered
			Lou...

MOUSE
			Killed Winslow too...

WILLIAM
			I still have the scar where he
			cut me.  And you're worried that
			he might get hurt?
				(beat)
			I say we arm our sentries.

The suggestion provokes a shocked, awkward silence.

PASCAL
			I don't know, William...


Something has occurred to Mouse.  He looks around.


MOUSE
			Hey!  Where's Vincent?

FATHER
			Vincent has concerns that
			weigh heavily on him right now.

			William, what sort of weapons
			would you suggest?


And as William begins to expand on his plan, we 
		

CUT TO:





On the way up to the surface with Catherine, Vincent stops
on the bridge, looks down at his own reflection in the dark
waters of the pool, trying to find some truth there, some
hint of who or what she is.  Catherine stops too, looks
back at him, worried


CATHERINE
			Vincent?


Vincent slowly lifts his eyes from the image to Cathy.
Something has hold of him now; it won't let go.

VINCENT
			Catherine, I must go...

A long beat.  She knows what he is talking about.

CATHERINE
			To her tomb?
				(off his nod)
			Vincent, give yourself time...

VINCENT
			Too much time has passed already.


Seeing him, Cathy knows he cannot be talked out of this.


CATHERINE
			Then I'm going with you.

VINCENT
				(brusque)
			No.
				(softer)
			This is something I must face
			alone.

CATHERINE
			Why?  Don't you see what
			you're doing?  You're throwing
			up walls... isolating yourself
			from the people who love you...

VINCENT
			Sometimes... walls help keep
			us safe, Catherine.	

He turns away from her, walks brusquely back in the
direction from which they came, leaving her there.


FADE OUT


			    END OF ACT TWO









				ACT THREE


FADE IN:




Vincent begins his quest.  USE STOCK from previous episodes
as he journeys ever downward: through the concrete tunnels
and rock tunnels, across the bridge in the Whispering
Gallery, down the great stone stairway in the Chamber of
the Winds.  Somewhere along the way, he removes a burning
TORCH from a wall sconce, and carries it to light his way.



DISSOLVE TO:



Vincent descends the stairs of the well into subterranean
depths.  He's far below the surface now.  Down here, the
well is VERY DARK; the only light is his torch.  The walls
are DAMP, covered with FUNGUS and NITRE.  Far below, MISTS
swirl so the steps seem to descend forever.  We hear the
sound of DRIPPING WATER, the SCURRYING of RATS. Finally
Vincent STOPS, wary.  We sense that's something is wrong.
He lowers the torch. . . and we SEE that the next step is
MISSING, the stone broken off raggedly.  The step below
that has been shattered too, and the one after that.  One
more step and Vincent would have plunged to his death.

There's no way to continue down, unless... Vincent LEAPS
down over the gap.  But the step BREAKS under the impact
of the landing.  Stone and torch FALL into the endless,
echoing depths of the well, but Vincent GRABS hold of
another step, hangs suspended for a moment, then pulls
himself up.



DISSOLVE TO:



35A.CLOSE ON A BURNING TORCH

as Vincent pulls it down from a wall sconce.  The flames
push back the darkness; Vincent moves ahead into:




Vincent moves through a natural ROCK TUNNEL, narrow and
dark, its floor uneven. Thick FOG swirls around his
feet, and here and there we see the BONES of long-dead
animals.  The passage twists and turns; in places the
walls press so close he must squeeze through sideways.  A
low ceiling makes him duck.  Jagged stalagmites thrust up
from the floor like daggers; beads of water drip off the
stalactites that descend from the ceiling.

As he edges around one turn, Vincent comes on an
ancient MUMMY, gaunt and hideous, LYING in a horizontal
niche in the stone wall.  Its grave wrappings are brown
with age, its eyeholes like two black pits.  As Vincent
looks down at it grimly, we hear

NARCISSA(O.S.)
			Let him sleep, Vincent.  It is
			not good to wake the dead.


36A.REVERSE ANGLE


Vincent turns as NARCISSA emerges from the MISTS of a
nearby tunnel, reaching out for him with a trembling hand,
blind eyes full of concern.



VINCENT
				(startled)
			Narcissa...

NARCISSA
			So far from home, Vincent...
			there is nothing for you down
			here... what is it you seek?

VINCENT
			Anna...


That name seems to frighten Narcissa.  She turns away.



VINCENT
			You know these catacombs...
			show me the way, Narcissa.

NARCISSA
			Her bones have no answers.
			Go back, Vincent...




VINCENT
			It is too late for that...


Narcissa looks up at him.  His face is grim; he will not
turn back, cannot turn back.  With a reluctant nod, the
old blind woman leads Vincent deeper into the earth.


CUT TO:





A vast, cavernous chamber.  This in an ancient place,
gloomy and foreboding.  What little illumination we find
is a dim, sickly GREEN and a faint VIOLET, from the areas
of FUNGUS that festoon the walls, GLOWING with its own
faint phosphorescence.  Below runs a swift, treacherous
UNDERGROUND RIVER, its black waters thundering around a
landscape of rocks and fallen pillars.


Narcissa leads Vincent along a narrow LEDGE that hangs
over the river.  A series of CAVE MOUTHS open onto the
ledge like the mouths of hungry beasts.  Other ledges --
MOVE IN TIGHT, we see that many -- though not all -- of
the small caves have been CAPPED with huge rocks, made
into sepulchres for the dead.


Vincent stops, and we TILT BACK to reveal that he has
stopped in front of the tomb.


The sepulchre is closed by a massive stone, covered with
purple-white nitre.  We can read the name ANNA, chiseled
deep into the stone.  There is more writing, but it is
so OVERGROWN by nitre that the words CANNOT BE READ.
















Narcissa touches Vincent's arm, to draw him away.


NARCISSA
			There is nothing here but cold
	    		stone... death... her spirit is
			gone, child...

VINCENT
			Once you told me you could
			summon spirits...

Narcissa shakes her head;  she can't, or won't.


NARCISSA
			Some who walk in death are...
			fearful... cold and bitter as the
			wind that roars up from the
			abyss... evil...

VINCENT
			Anna was a good woman.

NARCISSA
			In life... but death can twist
			a heart... poison it... and Anna's
			death was... terrible.

VINCENT
			How did she die, Narcissa?


Sadly, Narcissa reaches up, touches Vincent's face.


NARCISSA
			Ask the Father.

Vincent's mouth twists unhappily at that suggestion; he
is beginning to doubt the answers he gets from Father.
He turns his attention back to the stone, reaches up,
begins to pull away the clinging vines, to clean off the
thick covering of nitre that obscures the tombstone.


37B.CLOSE ON THE STONE

as Vincent exposes the other words.  The large deep
letters read ANNA PATER.  Underneath is carved Beloved
wife to John.




38. CLOSE ON VINCENT


He stares at the tomb in SHOCK, whispers one portentous
word as the realization hits him.


VINCENT
				(whisper)
			... Paracelsus...


It all began to come together for him.  The fears, the
doubts, the suspicions too terrible to say aloud.  OVER
we hear the first, faint beginning of a steady, ominous
POUNDING on the sound track, a dim, insistant throb
behind Vincent's eyes.  As it grows louder, we INTERCUT
the CU of Vincent with a series of QUICK, SHORT CLIPS
from previous episodes:
			

39. a)  Father telling the children how Vincent was found and
    brought to him (from "God Bless the Child"),

40. b)  Paracelsus asking Vincent if he really believes the
    story Father told him (from "The Alchemist"),

41. c)  Father telling Vincent that Anna was his mother from
    earlier this episode,

42. d)  Paracelsus avowing that he loved Vincent, was not
    allowed to take him with him (from "To Reign in Hell"),

43. e)  Paracelsus with his knife at Father's throat at
    Winterfest, saying "but we remember, don't we?"  (from
    "Dead of Winter")


44. RESUME


Wild-eyed and frantic, Vincent turns to Narcissa... but
the old woman is gone, melted away as mysteriously as she
appeared.  He is alone.  The POUNDING inside his head is
DEAFENING now.  He bares his fangs in a silent snarl,
throws back his head, covers his ears, and lets loose
with a ROAR of pain and rage to drown out the noise.


Maddened, he begins to pull at the massive stone that
seals Anna's tomb, trying to open the sepulchre, but the
stone is too heavy even for Vincent's strength and his
efforts come to nothing.  As Vincent SLUMPS in tortured
defeat, we

ELLIOTT Burch is reviewing some blueprints when his
intercom BUZZES.  He picks up the phone.


ELLIOTT		
			Burch.
				(beat, reacts)
			Yes.  Send her right in.


His office door opens, and Cathy enters.  ELLIOTT rises and
comes around his desk.  There's a certain tension in the
moment, given their last meeting.


ELLIOTT
			If you're here to make some
			More accusations, you can go
			Right out the way you came in.

CATHERINE
			I'm here to say I'm sorry.  I
			Was wrong about you, ELLIOTT.


ELLIOTT considers that for a moment, then nods.


ELLIOTT
			Apology accepted.  I've given you
			reason to doubt me in the past,
			and... well... it seems even
			Spirko thought he was dealing with
			me.


CATHERINE
				(surprised)
			How do you know that?











ELLIOTT
			I had to try and clear my good
			name.
				(beat, wry)
			Such that it is.  I've got a
			private detective looking for
			Spirko's source.

CATHERINE
			ELLIOTT, be careful.  The man
			you're after is very dangerous.
			I know him...


ELLIOTT REACTS, raises an eyebrow.


ELLIOTT
			Then why haven't you gone to the
			police?
				(she can't answer)
			More secrets.  Of course.


Cathy turns to leave.  At the door, she hesitates.



CATHERINE
			If you can find him...

ELLIOTT
			Don't worry.  You'll be the first
			To know.


Cathy nods her thanks and departs.  ELLIOTT sits back down,
makes a steeple of his fingers, and stares thoughtfully
off into the distance.

Father is working alone, going over some maps of the
tunnels, as Cathy enters, worried.  He looks up, almost
expressionless for a moment.





FATHER
			Catherine.  Vincent's not back
			yet, I'm afraid...

CATHERINE
			I need to talk to both of you.
			It's ELLIOTT, he -


She breaks off as Vincent enters suddenly; the look on
his face drives all thought of ELLIOTT from her mind.
There is something grim and terrible about him, an
intensity that is almost frightening.  When he speaks,
his voice is brusque, a little scary.  Although he
addresses Catherine, his eyes never leave Father even for
a second.


VINCENT
			Catherine, leave us.


Cathy moves closer to him.  She can see he's in pain;
she wants desperately to console him.


CATHERINE
			Vincent, what...


Vincent still stares at Father as he interrupts her.


VINCENT
				(curt, hard)
			Anna was John Pater's wife.


Visibly shaken, father averts his eyes.  Stunned by the
news, Cathy can only look between the two men.  Silence
hangs in the air, and the tension is almost palpable.
Cathy realizes she has to let them alone to settle this.


CATHERINE
			I'll wait in your chamber.


Vincent gives a tiny, almost imperceptible NOD.  Cathy
EXITS, with a last, concerned look behind.  Only when
her footsteps have died away does Vincent speak.






VINCENT
			Is it true, then?  Was...
			Paracelsus... my father?


Father's face is twisted in pain as he looks up.  He
tries to speak, to frame some kind of answer, but the
words will not come.  His mouth works, but nothing
emerges but a helpless choking sound; he is barely
holding back the tears.  Finally, unable to answer,
Father buries his head in his hands.


VINCENT
				(agonized)
			Father, what have you done?


At that, Father looks up, forces himself to speak.


FATHER
			It was done... out of love...


VINCENT
			The greatest crimes are always
			committed in the name of love.


FATHER
			Once it all seemed so... so
			obvious... now... dear god,
			sometimes I feel so lost...























VINCENT
			Tell me...


Father meets Vincent's implacable stare, looks away.



FATHER
			The beginning... was John.


Vincent listens with a grim face, never sitting, moving
restlessly around the chamber as Father speaks, his
motions progressively faster and more abrupt, like a
caged animal that can barely contain its rage.


FATHER
			He and Anna... had tried for so 
			long to have a child, but... it
			was impossible, Vincent.  The
			fault was in John.  He was...
			unable to father a child.


VINCENT
			Yet Anna became pregnant...




























FATHER
			Anna thought it was a miracle.
			but John just... smiled... as
			if, somehow... he knew...


Father stops suddenly, struggling with painful memories.


VINCENT
			Go on.

FATHER
			Vincent, please...


VINCENT
				(very sharp)
			Go on!


Father looks away, fighting back tears at the bite in
Vincent's voice.  He seems to have lost the track of the
story;  Vincent prompts him to continue.



VINCENT
			Why did you lie to the others?


FATHER
			I... thought it best not to...
			frighten them...


VINCENT
			I was an infant.  What could they
			Have feared?


FATHER
			The unknown.
				(beat)
			Men are afraid of what they
			cannot understand... and they
			hate what is different...


VINCENT
			But surely someone must have
			known.  Anna was pregnant...




FATHER
			No one knew.  Anna...
				(beat, shaken)
			Vincent, she was only in her third
			month when she went into labor.


We see Vincent's SHOCK as he whirls back on Father.


VINCENT
			Her third month?


FATHER
			The moment it began, I knew
			something was... wrong... but I
			never could have imagined...


VINCENT
			Paracelsus...


FATHER
			John was a genius in his own way,
			but... unorthodox... still,
			none of us ever dreamed that he
			would... experiment... on his
			own wife...


VINCENT
			Did Anna know what he was doing?


FATHER
			Right at the end... when she
			was too weak to scream... she
			looked at John and I saw the
			knowledge there in her eyes...
				(beat)
			Afterwards... I made myself
			perform the autopsy.  What I found
			was... unspeakable...


There's a long, ominous silence as Vincent, pacing tries
to come to terms with what father has said.  But finally he
stops, turns, stares into Father's eyes.


VINCENT
			Then... Anna died in childbirth...
			like Devin's mother...


FATHER
				(evasive)
			Not. . . precisely like Devin's
			mother, no...

Father looks away.  Vincent turns his face back.

VINCENT
			Then how?

When Father will not speak, Vincent SHAKES him roughly.

VINCENT
			How?!

Father looks at Vincent with fear in his eyes.

FATHER
			Vincent, you... were not...
			born... like other children
			you... you... ripped your way out
			of your mother's body.  There was
			nothing I could do...
 				(weeping)
			Dear God, there was nothing I
			could do...

Some dark part of Vincent had suspected it all along, so he
reacts not with surprise, but with the stunned sickness
of a man who realizes his worst fears are true.  He
shoves Father away as if he no longer mattered, raises
his clawed hands, stares at them.

CUT TO:



Catherine waits alone in Vincent's chamber, restive,
uncomfortable, worried.  She moves restlessly about the
room, silently struggling with her own thoughts, her own
fears.  The room is dim,  with the only sound of her
footsteps to break the silence.

Then, suddenly, ECHING down the tunnels from Father's
chamber, comes a terrible wordless SCREAM that goes on and
on and on, an endless despairing wail of unspeakable
anguish... the cry of a human being in unbearable pain, but
laced with inhuman desperation and animal rage.

It's like no cry Vincent has ever made before, and the
sound of it chills Catherine to the bone.  OFF her

				     ACT IV

FADE IN:


Catherine waits anxiously.  When Vincent enters, she starts
to rush toward him, but the look in Vincent's eyes freezes
her where she stands.  Suddenly Cathy is afraid.


CATHERINE
			Vincent, what is it?


Vincent looks away from her. He cannot meet her gaze.


VINCENT
			Catherine, you must leave me.

CATHERINE
			No...


WHIRLING suddenly, Vincent snaps out at her in rage.


VINCENT
			YES!
				(softer, contrite)
			Go back to your world, Catherine.
			Go back to the life you once
			lived, and put all memory of me
			behind you.


Catherine is devastated, but not about to give up.


CATHERINE
			What did Father tell you?

VINCENT
			He told me... that all my worst
			fears are true...

CATHERINE
			Tell me what he said.
				(off his silence)
			Vincent, I love you... whatever
			it is, we can face it together.

VINCENT
			What you love is only part of me.


CATHERINE
			No.  I love all of you,
			Vincent.

VINCENT
			You cannot know what you're
			saying.  There are darknesses
			within me that you cannot
			imagine...

CATHERINE
			Whatever Father said ... it
			doesn't matter.  You haven't
			changed.  You're still gentle...
			strong...  wise...


But Vincent, tormented to the breaking point, interrupts
her.


VINCENT
				(sharp, angry)
			Stop!
				(she falls silent)
			You and father... neither of you
			will admit the truth, even as it
			stands right in front of you.
			Look at me, Catherine.  Look at
			me!  What do you see?

CATHERINE
				(simply, with dignity)
			The man that I love.


The look on Vincent's face says it all; he is not a man
at all.  He turns away, struggling with grief, rage, a
thousand other emotions.  There's a long silence.


VINCENT
				(very softly)
			There are no mirrors in this
			chamber, Catherine...
				(beat)
			... but there are mirrors in the
			soul, and I cannot live with what
			I see there.


Vincent's back remains turned.  Catherine moves close,
reaches out to him, to soothe him with her touch, perhaps
embrace him.  But he seems to sense her approach.


VINCENT
				(very sharp)
			Don't...
				(she draws back)
			... touch me.
				(long beat)
			It is... not safe to love me,
			Catherine.

Vincent raises his clawed hands and regards them for a
moment with loathing.  He closes them into fists, and his
next words are so soft we barely hear them.


VINCENT
			I killed Anna.  These hands...
			ripped apart my mother's
			flesh. . . tore me from her
			womb... I was born in blood.


51. CLOSE ON CATHY

as she reacts to the revelation.  There's a brief moment
of stunned shock, but it's gone almost at once.


CATHERINE
				(quiet passion)
			No. I don't believe it.

52. RESUME


VINCENT
				(lost in despair)
			Believe what you want.  Just...
			leave me...

Silence falls over the chamber.  Cathy stands very still
for a long time, facing Vincent's back, wanting so much
to touch him.  She reaches out... and Vincent, sensing her,
whirls, SNARLING.  Cathy draws back, suddenly afraid.
Vincent turns away again, every muscle taut with tension,
forbidding and somehow... alone... beyond her comfort.
There's nothing more to be said.  Helpless, Catherine
starts to leave.  She's at the exit when Vincent speaks.


VINCENT
			Catherine...

Hopes flare briefly in Cathy's face; is he going to ask
her to stay?  But Vincent does not move.  He speaks with
his back still to her.


VINCENT
			Don't. . . look back.


Tearful, Catherine turns and EXITS.  The camera lingers
on Vincent, alone in his moment of existential torment.

inside and down the stairs.  They conduct a swift,
silent, methodical search; opening doors, closets,
checking out other (unseen) rooms. Finally one of them
holsters his weapon, calls back.

OPERATIVE
			We're clear.  There's nobody

Manning steps inside the penthouse, flips on the lights.
ELLIOTT and Cathy enter just behind him.

The detective gives the room a once over, notices
something.  He kneels beside a couch, inspects the carpet,
then looks up at Burch.

MANNING
			Let's get this moved.

ELLIOTT and Manning wrestle the couch out of the way,
revealing an irregular RED-BROWN STAIN on the rug.  In
b.g., one of the operatives is running his hands over the
walls, the other checking the windows.

CATHERINE
			Bloodstains...

MANNING
			This makes it a police matter.

			You want to do the honors, or

Inside, an older man - - dressed in the same clothing we saw
Paracelsus in during act one - - sits manacled to a choir
chair.  He's weak from thirst, badly injured, his head
bowed, unconscious.  Manning's men level their pistols and
we HEAR the sounds of hammers being cocked.

Slowly, the man raises his head.  It's FATHER, the face
swollen and bruised, lips dry and cracked.

Cathy rushes to him.  Elliott is baffled.

			Death has its own power.  Perhaps
			that was what you felt.

FATHER
			You opened your eyes, Vincent!
			You looked at me. You knew me!
			And I knew that something new had
			come into the world, that you were
			destined for... for unimaginable
			things...


A storm of emotion crosses Vincent's face as he surges
abruptly to his feet, looming over Father, anger held
barely in check.


VINCENT
				(scornful, raging)
			And it was up to you to see that
			nothing stood in the way of that
			destiny!

FATHER
			Yes, yes!


Vincent spins away angrily, begins to PACE the room like a
caged animal.  A dull POUNDING begins in his head.


VINCENT
			No matter who you hurt... how many
			lives were warped or destroyed
			by your lies...

FATHER
			They didn't matter!  Don't you
			see that?  They were ordinary,
			unimportant... but you...

Father comes to his feet, moves after Vincent.  In the
passion of the moment, he walks without a limp and his cane
remains, forgotten, at the side of the chair.



FATHER
			No! You have to listen!  You have
			to understand!


Father GRABS Vincent's shoulder, whirls him around.
Vincent bares his teeth and GROWLS, low, ominous.


CUT TO:




as they hurry down.  Injured and without his cane, Father
leans heavily on Cathy.


FATHER
			When Anna lost the child in her
			third month, it did something to
			John... then she found the baby
			in the snows outside St.
			Vincent's, and somehow... in
			John's mind... it all became...
			confused...


CATHERINE
			He began to see Vincent as the
			son he lost...


FATHER
			Yes. Anna loved Vincent, but
			she could see how unhealthy
			John's obsession was getting.
			It broke her heart, but... she
			thought it was best if the
			child stayed with me.


CATHERINE
			Didn't she know how Paracelsus
			would react?











FATHER
			In spite of everything, she still
			loved John.  She thought his grief
			would pass... that he would
			forgive her... instead...
				(long beat)			
			He gave her the poison in a glass
			of wine... he told me later
			it was the hardest thing he'd ever
			done... that he'd done it for
			Vincent.  He actually seemed to
			think I'd understand, and give the
			child to him.


They are INTERRUPTED by a sudden challenge.


JAMIE
			Halt.  Give me the password!			


62. REVERSE ANGLE - TUNNEL JUNCTION

as Jamie steps out of a side tunnel.  She's holding her
crossbow, aimed and ready.


CATHERINE
			Jamie, Father's hurt.  Help me!


She starts forward, but Jamie quickly raises the bow


JAMIE
			Don't come any closer.
				(stares at Father)	
			Father said that... Paracelsus
			might disguise himself...


CATHERINE
			Paracelsus is down below.  This
			is Father.


JAMIE
			How do I know that?








For a moment, they all stand frozen.  Cathy replies.


CATHERINE
			You know...


OFF Jamie's indecision, we


CUT TO:



Father and Vincent stand inches apart.


FATHER
			Do you think it was easy for me?
			you can't know... the price I
			paid... for you.


Vincent rips free of Father, paces, his rage building.
each word is a body blow.


FATHER
			For years afterward, I could
			see her face... sometimes, when I
			pass through the Chamber of the
			Winds, I can hear it still...
			the screaming, and the... the
			sound you made as you... tore
			your way into the world.


Vincent's hands flex, unflex; the ominous, dull POUNDING in
his skull grows louder.  He's sick with horror.


VINCENT
			Stop it!  Stop it!


FATHER
			You have to hear.









VINCENT
			No more!

FATHER
			Why do you resist your own
			nature?

VINCENT
			NO!


His voice is hoarse; he can barely speak.  Tortured,
Vincent pushes past Father, toward the exit.


FATHER
			Where are you going?  You
			can't run from it.  You know
			that, Vincent.


Vincent stops, tries to speak, but his language has
deserted him.  The sound he makes is subhuman.


FATHER
			They've tried to smother it
			with piety. . . chain in their
			little moralities... but you
			can still hear the singing in
			your blood, can't you?
				(very soft)
			Can't you?

Vincent closes his eyes, hangs his head.  He can.  Father
moves closer behind him, almost whispering.			


FATHER
			Don't fight it.  It's you,
			Vincent.  It's who you are.  It's
			who you always were... from the
			moment of your birth...

Vincent's head snaps around, and he stares at Father, his
face bestial, the bloodlust just below the surface.


FATHER
			Good and evil are human
			concepts.  Let go of them,
			Vincent.  Let the power fill
			you... make you its own...

Even Vincent's language fails him now.  All he can do is
weakly shake his head, trying to deny it.  But he's lost.


FATHER
			Your victims knew the truth.
			Could you see it in their
			faces?  Remember the look in
			their eyes as they beheld
			you... the smell of their blood
			on your hands...
				(beat, seductive)
			Imagine... the taste of it...
			like copper and fire on your
			tongue...


64. CLOSE ON VINCENT

as he finally BREAKS.  The last desperate humanity in him
vanishes, snuffed out like a candle in a hurricane, and
the BEAST emerges... wild, wounded, in pain.  He ROARS,
blind with bloodlust and rage.


65. ANGLE ON FATHER

as Vincent strikes out at him.  There is no fear on
Father's face; he looks triumphant, almost ecstatic.
Vincent seizes him roughly, SLAMS him backward over the
table, plunges a clawed hand deep into father's chest, and
RIPS down, disemboweling him in one terrible, deadly
stroke.  Still father does not scream, even as a thin froth
of BLOOD bubbles from his mouth.


66. VINCENT

Horror fills his eyes as he realizes what he's done.  He
stares down at his hands, red with Father's blood.


67. ANGLE PAST VINCENT ON FATHER

smiling as he lays dying.  When he speaks, we hear John
Pater's voice at last.


FATHER
				(Paracelsus' voice)
			It's alright.  Don't be afraid.

He reaches up to his neck, pulls off the mask.  We see the
alchemist as we've never seen him before; a warm smile on
his face, his eyes full of his own strange kind of love.
he lifts himself on an elbow, grasps Vincent's bloody
hands, kisses him.



PARACELSUS
			Now you are... my son... at
			last...



And with that, John Pater falls back on the table, dead



68. VINCENT

backs away, still unable to take his eyes off the carnage,
until he HEARS sounds, and looks up as we...



69. ANGLE PAST VINCENT

and RACK FOCUS.  Cathy and Jamie stand in the tunnel
entrance, supporting Father between them.  They can see
everything; the body, Vincent's blood soaked hands, his
shame.  Their faces are filled with a desperate horror.
He looks up, into Catherine's eyes.


There's nothing more to say.


Off this endless, terrible moment, we


FADE TO BLACK


70. BLACK FRAME

We HOLD on blackness foe a LONG, SOLID BEAT, before we


FADE BACK IN


71. INT - VINCENT'S CHAMBER - CLOSE ON VINCENT

Somehow they have gotten Vincent to the sanctuary of his
chamber, but the scene is still with him, will always be
with him.  He sits in a chair, unmoving, staring off at
nothing.  Father and Catherine are with him, but Vincent,
lost in his own nightmare, seems almost unaware of their
presence.  Father puts away his stethoscope, closes his
medical bag.  Cathy approaches, shaken and concerned, and
speaks to him in an URGENT WHISPER.



CATHERINE
			Will he be alright?

FATHER
				(troubled, afraid)
			In time... I hope...

His voice trails off; clearly, Father is worried.  He
forces himself to continue more briskly.

FATHER
			I'll sit with him if you...
			have to go...

CATHERINE
			No.  I'm staying... as long as
			he needs me.

She leaves Father, moves close to Vincent, takes his
hand in her own.  Her voice is gentle, full of love.

CATHERINE
			Vincent, it's finished.  You
			only did what had to be done,
			and now... we're free... the
			nightmare is finally over.

Vincent's head turns SHARPLY.  He stares at her, and we
MOVE IN TIGHT on his eyes.

72. VINCENT'S POV

as he looks at Catherine and Father behind her.  When he
speaks his voice sounds strange; deeper, harsher, as if
the very act of speech was painful to him.

VINCENT
				(ominous)
			No.  It's not over.


MATCH DISSOLVE TO:


73. VINCENT'S POV - INFRARED (SFX)

on Catherine and Father.  It's as if Vincent can see the
hot blood coursing through their bodies, their hearts
alive in their chests.  OVER we hear the steady THUMP-
THUMP-THUMP sound of their HEARTBEATS, growing louder
and louder.  The screen goes to dark, dull RED and we

FADE OUT

				THE END
