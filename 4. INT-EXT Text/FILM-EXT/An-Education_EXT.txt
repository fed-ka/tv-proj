Jenny and Graham are talking while he struggles to take his
bike out of a bicycle rack slightly unbalanced by the
violin strapped to his back. Graham is nervous,
chronically unconfident and shy.
GRAHAM
Should I wear, you know, Sunday
best?
4.
JENNY
You'd better, I'm afraid. Just to
show my father you're un jeune
homme serieux, not a teddy boy.
GRAHAM
Oh, God.
JENNY
It'll be all right. I won't wait.
It's going to bucket down in a
minute. I'll see you at the
weekend.
Jenny moves as quickly as she can towards the street.
GRAHAM
Oh, yes. Bye.
The two silly boys from before arrive to blow more kisses.
SMALLER BOY 1
Goodbye, darling! See you at the
weekend! I will miss you with all
of my heart!
Graham blushes. Jenny swipes the chief offender over the
head with her sheet music.

The rain has begun. Jenny attempts to cover herself. A
mother and two children cross the road in front of her, and
a beautiful, sleek red sports car - a Bristol - stops to
let them across. David, possibly in his mid-thirties,
dapper, and almost but not quite handsome, is driving the
car. David, distracted, impatient, spots Jenny at the bus
stop.
In front of the car a small wellington boot drops off the
foot of one of the children,further slowing down their
painfully slow progress across the road.
Jenny is wet. David makes eye contact. Jenny smiles
ruefully, and enchantingly. David sighs, and then hesitates
for a moment. The window of the Bristol slowly rolls down.
DAVID
Hello.
Jenny ignores him.
DAVID
Listen. If you've got any sense,
you wouldn't take a lift from a
strange man.
5.
Jenny smiles thinly.
DAVID
I am, however, a music lover, and
I'm worried about your cello. So
what I propose is, you put it in
the car and walk alongside me.
JENNY
How do I know you won't just
drive off with the cello?
DAVID
Ah. Good point.
He winds down the other window and waves on the cars that
have stopped behind him.
DAVID
How much does a new cello cost?
Twenty pounds? Thirty? I don't
know. Let's say thirty.
He pulls out a wallet, takes out three ten-pound notes,
hands them to her.
DAVID
There. Security.
Jenny laughs and waves the money away.
7
7
Later. The cello is in the back seat of the Bristol. Jenny
is trotting alongside the car, while David leans
nonchalantly across the passenger seat to talk to her while
driving.
DAVID
I'm David, by the way.
She says nothing.
DAVID
And you are...?
JENNY
Jenny. (Beat) I've never seen a
car like this before. C'est tres
chic.
DAVID
It's a Bristol. Not many of `em
made.
Jenny nods, but doesn't know how to respond.
6.
DAVID
How did the concert go?
JENNY
It was a rehearsal. The concert's
next Thursday.
DAVID
What are you playing?
JENNY
(making a face)
Elgar.
DAVID
Ah, Elgar. I often think it's a
shame he spent so much time in
Worcester, don't you? Worcester's
too near Birmingham. And you can
hear that in the music. There's a
horrible Brummy accent in there,
if you listen hard enough.
Jenny looks at him and smiles. She hadn't expected him to
be able to make Elgar jokes.
DAVID
Anyway, I'm not sure Elgar and
Jews mix very well.
JENNY
I'm not a Jew!
DAVID
(smiling)
No. I am. I wasn't...accusing
you.
JENNY
Oh. (She smiles awkwardly.) Can I
sit in the car with my cello?
David stops the car.
DAVID
Jump in.

The Bristol is crawling along the road at walking pace.
10

David reaches across Jenny while driving slowly, opens the
glove compartment and takes out a packet of cigarettes.
DAVID
Smoke?
JENNY
I'd better not. I'm a bit close
to home.
David lights one for himself.
DAVID
I suppose cellists must go to a
lot of concerts.
JENNY
We don't go to any concerts. We
don't believe in them.
DAVID
Oh, they're real.
JENNY
So people say.
DAVID
Why don't we believe in them?
JENNY
I suppose...What would he say?
DAVID
Your father, this is?
8.
JENNY
(Darkly)
Oh, yes. He'd say there's no
point to them. They're just for
fun. Apart from school concerts,
of course, which are no fun at
all, so we go to those. The
proper ones don't help you get
on.
DAVID
Which of course is what is so
wonderful about them. Anyway,
you'll go one day.
JENNY
(heartfelt)
Yes. I will. I know. Sometimes it
seems as though that's what all
this slog is for. If I get to
University, I'm going to read
what I want and think about what
I want and listen to what I want.
And I'm going to look at
paintings and go to French films
and talk to people who know lots
about lots.
DAVID
Good for you. Which University?
JENNY
Oxford. If I'm lucky. Did you go
anywhere?
DAVID
I studied at what I believe they
call the University of Life. And
I didn't get a very good degree
there.
Jenny smiles.
JENNY
This is me. Thank you.
She gets out of the car with the cello. David stares after
her for a moment, then drives off.
11
12A
She has seen something on the doorstep, and she stoops to
pick it up - a large bunch of flowers.
JENNY
They're for me!
MARJORIE
(curious)
Who are they from?
Jenny opens the card that's attached to them.
JENNY
Gosh. Him.
MARJORIE
Who's `him'?
JENNY
Just...A chap I met.
MARJORIE
A chap who sends flowers? So he's
a man-chap?
11.
JENNY
Yes, he is, really.
Jack stares at the flowers in disbelief. The bunch of
flowers has created in Jack the kind of panic and fear more
typically associated with a biochemical attack.
JACK
What's going on here?
MARJORIE
(drily, knowing the
trouble this will
cause)
Jack,I'm afraid Jenny has been
sent some flowers by a chap.
JACK
A chap? What kind of chap? Who?
Why?
JENNY
(patiently)
He's wishing me luck for tonight.
JACK
Are you sure that's all he's
wishing? And where does he get
the money from?
JENNY
He earns it, I expect.
JACK
What do you mean, he earns it?
Why isn't he at school? What does
he do?
JENNY
Can we just go? Otherwise the
bunch of good-luck flowers will
actually be responsible for me
actually missing the concert.
Which would be ironic, n'est ce
pas?
JACK
Well I don't like it.
MARJORIE
Objection noted. Jenny?
JENNY
Noted.
12.
JACK
Ten bob's worth of luck, I
reckon. That's a lot for a
schoolgirl. You can't leave them
out here, anyway. I'd burgle a
house that had flowers outside.
They'll think we're made of
money.
12B
14
Jenny, Hattie and Tina emerge from the cafe, talking.
JENNY
Well I'm going to be French. I'm
going to Paris and I'm going to
smoke and listen to Jacques Brel
and wear black. And I won't
speak. Ever. C'est plus chic,
comme...
She breaks off. Parked outside a tobacconists on the other
side of the road is the red Bristol. She looks towards the
shop, and David emerges with a copy of the Times and a
packet of cigars. Jenny crosses the road to talk to him
while the others watch.
DAVID
Hello.
JENNY
Hello. Thank you.
DAVID
How did it go?
JENNY
Oh, fine. I think. I mean, I
didn't mess my bit up, anyway.
And no-one got thrown out of the
orchestra afterwards.
DAVID
Always the mark of a cultural
triumph. Listen. I'm glad I ran
into you. What are you doing on
Friday?
JENNY
Going to school.
DAVID
I meant the evening.
JENNY
(embarrassed)
Oh. Yes. Of course. Nothing.
14.
DAVID
Because I'm going to listen to
some Schubert in St John's, Smith
Square. My friends Danny and
Helen will be going too, so it
wouldn't be...I'll tell you what.
I'll come and pick you up, and if
your mother and father
disapprove, then you can have the
tickets and go with one of them.
How does that sound?
Jenny doesn't know what to say. She looks at David, and his
eagerness to please seems to convince her.
JENNY
Thank you. And I'd like you to
take me. I'd like to go with
someone who knows when to clap.
DAVID
I usually watch Danny. He knows
that sort of thing.
Jenny smiles.
DAVID
Seven? And we'll probably go for
a spot of supper afterwards, if
you...But if you, if that's
not...Well, we can always put you
in a taxi.
JENNY
(flat disbelief)
Supper.
DAVID
If you want.
JENNY
The trouble is, we'll already
have eaten.
DAVID
Well. I mean, if you'd like
supper, then, perhaps on Friday
you could...not eat?
JENNY
(embarrassed again)
Oh. Yes. Of course.
Jenny smiles, and rejoins her friends on the other side of
the road. Tina and Hattie are standing there almost with
their mouths open, amazed. She doesn't say anything and
starts to walk on.
15.
TINA
I'm sorry. I just had the
strangest dream. I dreamed you
crossed the road and spoke to a
handsome man with the most
beautiful car I've ever seen. And
then you came back and you didn't
mention it.
Jenny smiles enigmatically. Tina grabs Jenny mock-urgently.
TINA
`Oo wazzee?
JENNY
(light, playful)
Just a man who's been trying to
pick me up. We're going to a
concert on Friday night. And then
we're having a spot of supper.
TINA
(shrieking)
A spot of supper?
JENNY
You've heard of supper?
HATTIE
We've heard of it. But we've
never eaten it.
JENNY
Neither of you is interested in
the concert part, I notice.
HATTIE
No. Of course not.
TINA
Oh my God! I've only just
realised! That's what's going to
happen to you, isn't it? Look at
her! Men are going to pick her up
in the street and take her out to
supper!
HATTIE
God, you're right, Tina. I hadn't
thought of that. Look at her.
JENNY
Don't be so daft.
TINA
We're trying to attract the
attention of boys.
16.
And she's fighting off men.
Anyway. You're going to have to
tell us more than that.
JENNY
Why?
HATTIE
Because no man's ever
going to
ask us out to supper.
Not until
we're ladies, anyway.
You're
going to have to tell
us
everything. Otherwise
it's not
fair.
JENNY
There won't be anything to tell.
TINA
Well, make something up, then.
15
15A
Jenny and David walk toward the beautiful hall. Jenny
suddenly looks young in the dress that looks too old for
her - other adults are milling around outside, and the
women don't look like girls dressed up. David makes for an
incredibly glamorous and attractive couple in their late
twenties who are waiting outside - DANNY and HELEN. Helen
is as far from anyone's idea of an aunt as one can get.
She's no more beautiful than Jenny, but she's dressed both
appropriately and spectacularly, in early-60s, pre-hippy
Bohemian gear. She turns heads in a way that Jenny is not
yet able to. Danny too is attractive, but soberly so. David
and Jenny are, in a way, paler, less striking versions of
these two.
DAVID
Hello hello. Are we late?
HELEN
I was hoping we'd miss the
beginning, and then it wouldn't
be worth going in, and we could
go off dancing or something.
DANNY
Helen is one of the more
reluctant members of tonight's
audience.
Jenny and David laugh politely.
DAVID
Jenny, these are my friends Helen
and Danny.
22.
Jenny shakes hands with the two of them. They both give her
fascinated and clearly appraising looks. They have heard
about her.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Shall we?
They walk into the hall.
16
18
Jenny, David, Danny and Helen emerge with the other concert-
goers.
DAVID
I booked a table at Juliette's.
Will that kill the mood, do you
think?
HELEN
Oh, I do hope so.
The others laugh.
HELEN
I always think I'm going to my
own funeral when I listen to
classical music. (Tentatively)
That was classical, wasn't it?
DANNY
Yes. Very classical. As classical
as you can get.
Helen looks pleased.
DAVID
Juliette's it is, then. Heaven
forbid that we should end the
evening reflecting on our own
mortality.
Jenny smiles in delight. She's never met people like this.
19
24
We see the Bristol parked outside, and Jenny walking
towards it, a small figure in a large playground. She's
clearly just changed out of her school uniform, and she's
making last-minute adjustments to her civvies. A teacher
walks towards her, and Jenny almost freezes - but the
teacher merely smiles pleasantly and walks past. Jenny
keeps walking at a measured pace for a moment and then
breaks into a run.
25
25
Jenny and David are driving along a North Kensington
street.
JENNY
How do you know Danny?
David is distracted. He's driving slowly, apparently
looking for an address.
DAVID
Oh, you know. We kept bumping
into each other, and we became
pals, and we've ended up doing a
bit of work together, when it
suits us.
JENNY
What kind of work?
DAVID
Property. A bit of art dealing.
Some buying and selling. This and
that...
He stops the car.
DAVID
I'll be two seconds.
He gets out of the car, and Jenny watches him as he crosses
the road.
31.
Outside a dilapidated house covered in scaffolding stands a
large West Indian family, mother, father, three or four
small children and a dog. They are surrounded by what
appears to be all their worldly goods. David squats down on
his haunches, talks to the kids, tousles the hair of the
smallest. Then he takes out a bunch of keys and ushers the
family down the path. He unlocks the door and leads them
inside.
In an upper window of the house, we see an old lady peering
down anxiously.
26
26
David emerges from the house, jangling his keys.
27
32
Jenny, Hattie and Tina are walking back from school.
TINA
You could always go to
secretarial college with Hattie.
JENNY
(sarcastic)
Oh, thanks.
HATTIE
Charming!
JENNY
Oh, no.
Hattie and Tina follow Jenny's eyes, and they see Graham
coming towards them pushing his bike, red-faced, trousers
tucked into socks.
GRAHAM
Hello.
JENNY
Oh. Graham. Hello.
GRAHAM
I haven't seen you for ages....It
all went wrong, didn't it? The
tea-party, I mean. Was it because
of the year off?
JENNY
No, no. It's just...I've got so
much to do if I'm going to get
the grades I need.
41.
TINA
Yes. She's got no time for boys.
Hattie and Tina try to suppress giggles. Graham turns an
even brighter shade of red. Hattie and Tina enter the
coffee bar. Jenny feels sorry for him, is on the verge of
inviting him to join them...And changes her mind.
JENNY
(quickly)
Bye, Graham.
She follows the girls inside.
33
42
The Bristol on the country road to Oxford.
43
43
The Bristol drives through Oxford. Jenny catches a quick
glimpse of a dreaming spire.
DANNY
Imagine spending three years
here.
HELEN
I know.
She shudders, as if someone has walked over her grave.
JENNY
Can we stop?
DAVID
Maybe later. There are a couple
of things we have to do.
44
44
Jenny and Helen in the back seat of the car, which is
parked outside a house in the back streets of Oxford.
There's no sign of Danny and David. Jenny sighs
impatiently.
HELEN
Oh, it's always like this. There
are millions of places I've never
seen because I've been stuck in
here.
JENNY
You never get out?
HELEN
There's never anywhere to go in
the places they stop.
Jenny looks out of the window. This is self-evidently true.
45
47
The Bristol, containing David and Jenny in the front seats
and Danny and Helen in the back, passing through a pretty
Oxfordshire village. It pulls up outside a country cottage
with a `FOR SALE' sign outside.
53.
48
49
The four get out of the car, and Jenny follows David and
Danny to the front door of the house. Helen hangs back.
HELEN
Jenny...
Jenny turns around.
JENNY
Aren't you coming?
HELEN
We don't go in.
JENNY
What are you talking about?
DANNY
Helen will look after you. Go and
find a nice cup of tea somewhere.
Jenny is mystified.
JENNY
I don't need looking after, thank
you very much. David, I want to
see...
David ignores her.
DANNY
I'm not going to tell you a
second time. Now. Run along.
49A
49A
Helen and Jenny waiting for the boys. Helen is blithe,
chatty; Jenny has a face like thunder.
HELEN
They won't be long. Either way.
JENNY
"Either way"?
54.
HELEN
Sometimes they find something,
sometimes they don't.
In the distance, David is waving at them urgently.
HELEN
And when they do find something,
we usually have to leave quite
quickly. They can be a bit
naughty, sometimes. Anyway. It's
nice to have company. I'm usually
outside on my own.
Jenny stares at Helen. She's beginning to realise who she
is dealing with.
50
SCENE OMITTED

51
SCENE OMITTED
51
52
52
An old picture of
some kind is wedged between Helen and
Jenny on the back
seat. Jenny, furious, is staring out of
the window. Helen
attempts to peer around the partition,
but settles for a
wave.
HELEN
Coo-ee. Jenny.
Jenny doesn't respond.
DANNY
Sorry about being a little brisk
back there, Jenny. We have our
way of doing things. Silly,
really.
Still no response.
DAVID
Oh, come on, Jenny. Let's not
spoil things.
JENNY
(disbelieving)
Me? I'm spoiling things?
DAVID
I think there must be some kind
of misunderstanding.
Jenny shakes her head bitterly. They continue driving in
silence.
55.
53
53
The Bristol pulls up outside Danny's Bedford Square flat.
DANNY
Who wants to come up
for a
drink?
DAVID
Jenny?
JENNY
(still furious)
No thanks. You go. I'll find my
own way home.
Jenny gets out of the car and starts up the road. David
gets out and starts to chase after her.
DAVID
Jenny!
He catches up with her in the street.
DAVID
It was an old map. A Speed. It
was cooped up in that miserable
little cottage, and she didn't
even know what it was. What a
waste! It shouldn't spend its
life on a wall in wherever the
hell we are. It should be with
us. We know how to look after it
properly. We liberated it.
Jenny snorts derisively.
JENNY
Liberated! That's one word for
it.
DAVID
(quickly and
passionately)
Oh, don't be bourgeois, Jenny.
You're better than that. I know
you have fun with us. I can see
it. You drink everything I put in
front of you down in one, every
last drop, and then you slam your
glass down on the bar and ask for
more, and it's wonderful. We're
not clever like you, so we have
to be clever in other ways,
because if we weren't, there
would be no fun.
56.
We have to be clever with maps,
and..and.. You want to know what
stats are? Stats are old ladies
who are scared of coloured
people. So I move the coloureds
in and the old ladies move out
and I buy their flats cheap.
That's what I do. So now you
know.
Jenny nods reluctantly.
DAVID
And if you don't like it, then I
will understand, and you can go
back to Twickenham and listen to
the Home Service and do your
Latin homework. But these
weekends, and the restaurants and
the concerts..They don't grow on
trees.
Jenny looks at him, startled. Trees again?
DAVID
Do you understand? Of course you
do. This is who we are, Jenny.
He turns to face her and holds out his hand. On Jenny: is
she in or out? Jenny takes his hand. David pulls her
towards him, holds her around the waist and begins to dance
with her. Further up the pavement, Helen and Danny watch,
laughing.
54
54
David pulls up in the Bristol outside Jenny's house, and
they sit in the dark for a little while.
DAVID
I suppose you have homework to
do.
JENNY
Gosh. Yes. Loads. (Beat) Thank
you. I had a nice time.
DAVID
(surprised, despite his
speech earlier)
Really? In spite of the, the
incident? With the map?
JENNY
As you said in the car, it was a
misunderstanding.
57.
DAVID
Exactly. A muddle.
JENNY
You have no idea how boring
everything was before I met you.
DAVID
I hope that there's something
more than excitement to our
relationship.
JENNY
Excitement's a lot, when you're
at school and you live in
Twickenham.
DAVID
You know what I'm trying to say.
I want you to like me for who I
am, not just what I can do for
you.
JENNY
But that is who you are. I've
never met anyone like you. Action
is character, our English teacher
says.
DAVID
What does that mean?
JENNY
I think it means that if we never
did anything, we wouldn't be
anybody. And I never did anything
before I met you. And sometimes I
think no-one's ever done anything
in this stupid country, apart
from you.
DAVID
That's a good place to end the
weekend. I'll give you a tinkle.
JENNY
Thank you.
They look at each other. David is clearly smitten. He moves
towards her. He wants to kiss her, but he doesn't want to
frighten her - in the end, Jenny makes it easy for him and
moves towards him. They kiss gently and tenderly.
Flustered, Jenny breaks it off, gets out of the car and
goes inside while David watches.
58.
55
56
A group of girls cross-country running. Jenny and her
friends are at the back of the group, and the gym teacher ,
jogging backwards, gesticulates at them to get a move on.
GYM TEACHER
Ladies, please. Christmas is
coming.
They put on enough of a spurt to satisfy her, and then
immediately stop when the teacher is no longer watching.
Seeing an attractive bench, they sit down. From somewhere
under a skirt, Jenny produces a packet of exotic-looking
cigarettes and offers them around.
HATTIE
What the hell are those?
JENNY
Russian Sobranies.
Hattie and Tina make snooty faces. Jenny takes a cigarette.
The others follow suit. Jenny lights them, and they all
grimace. The contrast between the sophisticated cigarettes,
and the unsophisticated smokers and context is pronounced.
HATTIE
Where did they come from?
TINA
She might have bought them from
the Savoy, or Claridges, or the
opera, or some fancy nightclub.
Who knows, with Jenny?
JENNY
Paris. You can't buy them here.
TINA
(suddenly looking at
her suspiciously)
You never bought them yourself?
JENNY
(mimicking Tina's
grammar cruelly)
No. I never.
TINA
Shut up, you stuck-up cow.
JENNY
But I'll bring you some back, if
you want.
61.
TINA
You're joking.
JENNY
Non.
HATTIE
He's taking you to Paris?
JENNY
(smiling smugly)
Oui.
HATTIE
This term?
JENNY
Peut-etre.
TINA
Isn't it your birthday next
Tuesday?
JENNY
Might be.
The two friends shriek and jump up and down.
HATTIE
Oh, my God! Your birthday!
TINA
I wouldn't like to be you. All
those dinners you've had off him.
Ouch.
JENNY
You have such a Victorian
attitude to sex, you two.
TINA
Oh, sorry, Dr Kinsey. We're not
all as experienced as you. I
mean, you've done it...(She
counts on her fingers) I make it
never! Can that be right?
HATTIE
But your parents are just going
to let you swan off like that?
JENNY
They don't know yet. David's got
a plan, he says. He usually has
something up his sleeve.
62.
TINA
I've noticed that. What did he
tell them when you had your
weekend in Oxford?
JENNY
(animated by the memory)
Oh, it was....(She changes her
mind) David went to Oxford.
Merton. English. And he offered
to show me round.
HATTIE
So you have a good-looking
boyfriend with pots of money,
brains and a nice car.
JENNY
Apparently I do.
Tina makes a bitter face.
TINA
And they tell us there's a God.
Laughter. Jenny glances off into the distance, and spots a
portly middle-aged woman heading in their direction.
JENNY
Sod. Miss Davies.
They stand up, grind their Sobranies into the mud, kick
them under the bench, and set off at a brisk trot. The
Sobranie stubs come to rest near a pile of dog poo.
57
64
Juliette Greco on the soundtrack. Jenny leans against a
wall, the Seine and Notre Dame behind her. David takes her
picture. She looks fantastic in the clothes David has given
her for her birthday.
65
67
A Left Bank cafe - David and Jenny are eating steak frites
outside, drinking vin ordinaire, watching the world go by.
They are both anticipating the night ahead.
68
68
69
69
Jenny is smoking at the second-floor window of a simple,
pretty Parisian hotel, wearing a glamorous-looking slip and
looking at the street life below her.
70
71
...Jenny in her games kit, smoking her Sobranie with her
friends on the park bench again. Hattie and Tina are
examining their bottles of Chanel reverently. Jenny is back
to being her seventeen-year-old self; somehow her seventeen-
year-old self looks comical, and no longer appropriate.
TINA
How can you go back to double
French when you've had a weekend
with an older man in a posh hotel
in Paris? You wouldn't catch me
coming anywhere near this dump.
JENNY
(artfully)
It wasn't all glamour. We spent
half the weekend at Heathrow in a
hotel suite .
HATTIE
A suite? Oh my God. Your life.
They smoke their Sobranies ruminatively.
TINA
You're going to miss it. All the
swanning around in posh hotels.
JENNY
Why will I need to miss it?
TINA
When you go to Oxford. Unless
you're planning on being with
David forever.
Jenny doesn't say anything.
HATTIE
You're not, are you?
JENNY
(distracted)
God, no.
TINA
So? Won't you miss it?
Jenny shrugs. Clearly she will, and clearly she hasn't
thought about it before.
HATTIE
We'll miss it.
75.
Jenny laughs.

Helen, Danny, Jenny get out of David's Bristol, which is
parked outside a nightclub called Esmerelda's Barn. David
has parked next to a white Rolls-Royce.
JENNY
(looking at the Rolls-
Royce)
And we know the person who owns
this?
DAVID
Yes. Perec Rachman. He's a....
DANNY
A bastard.
Danny and David laugh.
DAVID
He's a business acquaintance, and
we need to talk to him.
JENNY
I gathered that much. But why do
we have to crawl around the West
End looking for his car? Why
don't you just make an
appointment, if you want to see
him?
78.
The men snigger.
DANNY
What? Ring his office? Talk to
his secretary? That isn't how it
works with him, dear.
74
77
Jenny is about to to open the passenger door of the
Bristol, but David stops her.
DAVID
Wait there.
He runs to the back of the car, opens the boot and starts
rummaging through it. It seems to be full of everything
but the thing he's looking for.
JENNY
What are you doing?
He slams the boot shut and comes back empty-handed.
DAVID
Will you marry me?
Jenny stares at him for a moment, then laughs.
JENNY
What were you looking for?
DAVID
I thought I had a ring. It
wouldn't have been the right one.
But it would have done for
tonight.
JENNY
(eyes twinkling with
amusement)
Oh, David.
DAVID
I'm serious.
JENNY
You're very sweet.
DAVID
What do you think?
82.
JENNY
(helplessly)
Please take me home.
She gets into the car. We see the desperation in David's
face, lit by the headlights of a passing taxi, as he slams
the door on Jenny after she's got in.
78
78
Jenny, Tina and Hattie all smoking in the school toilets.
Jenny is distracted, and standing apart from the others.
Tina looks at her.
TINA
How do you say `A penny for your
thoughts?' in French?
HATTIE
A franc is too much, isn't it?
TINA
For her thoughts, yes. You'd be
overpaying by about ninety-nine
centimes.
Suddenly the door bursts open and the Latin teacher comes
in.
79
80
Jenny is smoking on the balcony.
80A
84
Jenny is half-walking, half-running, towards the school
gates. She's scared, of course, but exhilarated, too. All
that pressure, and all those years of education, suddenly
over, unexpectedly, and certainly unceremoniously. She
looks neither left nor right, but other girls, younger
girls, watch her through the windows as she leaves. Jenny
doesn't even look round when she goes through the school
gates.
85
87
David and Jenny come out of Danny's flat and approach
David's car.
JENNY
Danny didn't seem very pleased
about our engagement.
DAVID
I thought that, too! I was
wondering whether he might be a
bit jealous.
JENNY
(trying not to be
pleased)
Jealous?
93.
DAVID
You may have noticed that Helen's
not really Oxford material. I'm
going to keep him out of your
way.
They both smile. David opens the door for Jenny and she
gets into the car.
87A
92
Jack and Marjorie approach David's Bristol.
JACK
I was hoping you'd take us in
this.
DAVID
Oh, you won't want to go in
anything else after tonight. Mind
you, it drinks petrol. I'm afraid
we'll have to stop on the way in
to town.
He opens the back door for his future in-laws.
DAVID
Madame. Monsieur.
They get in, he closes the door, runs round to open the
front passenger door for Jenny.
93
94
The Bristol cruises down a London arterial road.
95
96
David gets out of the car as the attendant comes over.
ATTENDANT
How can I help you, sir?
DAVID
You might as well fill her up.
David looks around and spots a phone box just outside the
garage. He leans in through the open car window.
DAVID
I'm just going to make a quick
call. I'll be two ticks.
97
98
David has finished his phone call and is walking towards
the car. He sees Jenny looking through letters and papers,
sees the open glove compartment, starts to run across the
forecourt.
DAVID
(desperately)
Jenny!
It's too late. We see Jenny's stricken face, gleaming in
someone else's headlights.
99
100
The Bristol draws up outside Jenny's house. David jumps out
of the car and lets Marjorie and Jack out. Jack starts to
walk towards the house and then stops.
JACK
(desperately)
You can sort this out, can't you,
David?
Jenny gets out of the car too.
DAVID
Of course I can. She's just got
the wrong end of the stick about
something.
JENNY
Go inside, Dad.
Jenny and David watch Jack and Marjorie go into the house.
The moment the door is closed, Jenny walks towards David.
She's holding a bunch of letters that she took out of the
glove compartment. She starts to throw them at him, one by
one.
JENNY
Mr and Mrs David Goldman, Mr and
Mrs David Goldman, Mr and Mrs
David Goldman, Mr and Mrs David
Goldman..
When she has thrown the last one, she flies at David - she
slaps him, punches him, scratches him. David tries to grab
her hands, but she's too wild.
DAVID
Just let me...
JENNY
You're MARRIED!
DAVID
Legally, yes, but...
Finally he manages to subdue her. She leans against the
car, distraught.
JENNY
When were you going to tell me?
102.
DAVID
Soon. It just - it never seemed
the right time. You seemed so
happy, and I was happy, and...It
would have spoiled everything.
What can I do, Minnie? What can I
do? How can...
JENNY
"Oh,
Jenny. I'm just too busy to
find
somewhere to live...I live
with
my mummy." You were living
with
your wife! All this time!
DAVID
Jenny...
JENNY
What's your address?
David gestures vaguely.
JENNY
Where?
DAVID
Byron Avenue.
JENNY
Byron Avenue! It's no wonder we
kept bumping into each other,
then, is it? What number?
DAVID
There's no point..
JENNY
(screaming)
WHAT NUMBER?
DAVID
Seventeen.
Jenny picks one of the envelopes up off the ground and
looks at it.
JENNY
(bitterly sarcastic)
Good grief. It's the truth.
DAVID
Please. You have to understand. I
was with you just about all the
spare time I had.
103.
JENNY
Spare time? Spare time? I can't
tell you how grateful I am.
DAVID
Don't be like this.
JENNY
I have nothing. I left school. I
didn't take my exams. Where's it
all gone, now? I gave my life
away.
DAVID
Jenny, I can get a divorce.
Everything will turn out for
the
best. You'll see.
We can see Jack and Marjorie peering through the lace
curtains anxiously.
JENNY
Go and tell them. Go and tell
them, then go and tell your wife.
I want to see you. I want to
stand there and watch.
David stands on the pavement, looking towards the house. He
looks away; he can't make eye contact with Jenny's parents.
DAVID
They're not going to listen to me
now. Let me come round tomorrow.
When everyone's calmed down a
bit.
JENNY
(suddenly desperate)
Please don't leave me to tell
them on my own. Please. You owe
me that much. You owe them that
much.
DAVID
(sadly)
I owe them a lot more than that.
I owe them everything. They gave
me you.
He opens the boot. It's full of cases of whiskey. Jenny
doesn't even bother asking what they are doing there. David
takes one of the bottles, opens it, takes a long slug.
JENNY
Two minutes. And then I'll come
out and drag you in.
104.
Jenny marches into the house and slams the door. The camera
stays on David. He gets back into the car and takes
another slug of whiskey. Then his shoulders begin to
shake, and he cries and cries.
101
102
A suburban street, full of semi-detached houses, not far
from Jenny's house. Jenny walks down the road tentatively -
she's looking at the numbers on the houses. She looks young
again - tired, no make-up, no elegant clothes. She can't
bring herself to wear anything that David bought her.
She hesitates at the top of the driveway to the house,
steels herself to walk down. But just at that moment the
door opens; there's a homely-looking woman, early 30s. She
is holding the hand of a three-year-old. Jenny is stunned.
But there's more to come.
105.
The woman deposits the child in the drive, goes back into
the house, comes out behind an enormous 1950s pram. David
has found time to father another baby.
WIFE
Oh. Hello.
JENNY
(almost inaudible)
Hello. I'm sorry. I think I must
have the wrong house.
The woman stares at her.
JENNY
Yes. I wanted number...It's my
cello lesson. Silly. I...
She dries up and looks at the woman helplessly.
WIFE
Oh, no. Don't tell me. Good God.
You're a child.
Jenny blushes. Beat. She turns and tries to walk back up
the driveway, but the woman won't let her go.
WIFE
No. No. You stay here. If you're
old enough to sleep with him,
you're old enough to look at me.
JENNY
I can't.
But she doesn't move, either.
WIFE
You didn't know about any of
this. Presumably.
Jenny shakes her head.
WIFE
No. They never do. Did he ask you
to marry him?
Jenny nods.
WIFE
Yes. Of course he did. You're not
in the family way, are you?
Because that's happened before.
Jenny shakes her head.
106.
WIFE
Thank God for that. At least you
can escape intact. (Beat)
Relatively speaking. Not all of
them have done.
She nods at the children.
WIFE
That's why he never goes through
with anything. He does love them.
JENNY
(looking into the pram)
She's beautiful.
WIFE
Thank you. He. (Bitterly) He's
four months old.
Jenny does the maths. It's all she can do to stop herself
from reeling backwards - she's visibly shaken.
JENNY
Four months!
WIFE
Yes. Babies often are that sort
of age. Perhaps you can remember
a night four months ago when he
seemed a little distracted.
Anyway. If you'll excuse us.
She pushes past Jenny and leaves her standing bereft on the
path.
103
112
Jenny walking alone through her old park.
112.
113
114
Jenny in a suburban street. She's looking for an address.
She finds the house, walks down the path, rings on a bell.
Miss Stubbs comes to the door.
MISS STUBBS
Jenny!
It's a warm greeting. She ushers her inside.
115
116
Eighteen months later. Swelling orchestral music. Close on
Jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, the cello strapped to her
precariously. The camera pulls back to show her cycling
through the streets of Oxford. She's done it. We follow her
for a little while. She dismounts outside a church and
leans the bike against a wall. Just as she's about to leave
it, she sees something and freezes. We follow her gaze:
it's the red Bristol, parked a little way down the road
just in front of her. She scans the street to see if she
can find David. She can - he's coming round a corner, a
littler further down the street, unwrapping a packet of
cigarettes. Jenny moves into his eye-line. He sees her,
stops, then walks towards her.
115.
DAVID
Jenny.
Jenny says nothing.
DAVID
Jenny. Minnie. I wanted to tell
you that I am going to ask my
wife for a divorce.
Jenny looks at him disbelievingly.
JENNY
Don't you understand what you've
done?
David looks at her. This isn't going to be as easy as he
thought.
DAVID
I can see my behaviour must have
been... confusing. But we've
never sat down and had a proper
chat about it all. About the whys
and wherefores. They can wait.
The important thing is that
you're still my Minnie Mouse, and
I love you, and you had fun. You
know you had fun.
JENNY
Yes. I had fun. But I had fun
with the wrong person, at all the
wrong times. And I can't ever get
those times back, now.(Beat)
Look, David. I'm in Oxford. Every
day I wake up and pinch myself.
And when I think how close I
came...
She looks at him and shakes her head, as if awaking from a
dream. A young man stops behind her on his bike, dismounts,
leans his bike against the wall next to hers, waits for her
to finish. She turns her back on David, and the young man
offers her his arm. They walk away together, and David
stares longingly after them.
