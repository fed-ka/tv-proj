      A tightly closed door labeled SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE is 
      guarded by a young woman. She perches behind a desk that 
      bristles with lumbering office equipment. 

      This is high tech, circa 1942. It looks tortuous, but LAUREN 
      HOWL (23) moves through it like a fighter pilot mid-dogfight. 

      AGENT WILL (SPARKS) SPARKMAN, 28, a big guy with a little 
      boy's nervous energy, is slumped in the visitor s chair 
      across from her. 

      A GRAPH PAPER NOTEBOOK is open in his lap.

      They re in the middle of a conversation. Lauren types 
      steadily, even while she s talking.

                                  LAUREN
                    I still think it s a cipher, but 
                    you re the FBI agent. I m just a 
                      secretary. What do I know?

                                  SPARKS 
                    Lauren Howl, since when has being 
                     just a secretary  ever stopped you 
                    from meddling in one of my cases?

                                  LAUREN
                    I never meddle.

                                  SPARKS
                    Ha!

                                  LAUREN
                    Hey, you came to me, Sparks. You can 
                    always go belly ache to someone else.

                                  SPARKS
                    I do not belly ache.

                                  LAUREN
                    Ha!

      Sparks scrubs at his face, frustrated.

                                  SPARKS
                    Harris is convinced the tractors are 
                      destroyers and the plows are subs.

      Lauren reaches across the desk, snags his notebook. Reads.                                                                                      3.


                                  LAUREN
                    Which would mean there are 24 Jerry U-
                    boats in the Potomac and the Navy just 
                    hasn t noticed?

                                  SPARKS
                    I didn t say Harris was right.

                                  LAUREN
                    Harris is never right.

                                  SPARKS
                    But if he s wrong, where s the code? 
                          (shaking his head)
                    If Esman is communicating with the 
                    Nazi s, he s using these invoices. We 
                    already ran the inventory numbers and--

                                  LAUREN
                    SHHHH.

                                  SPARKS
                    Did you just shush me?

                                  LAUREN
                    Yes! I ve almost... it s the prices.

                                  SPARKS
                    Huh?

                                  LAUREN
                    String them together and have the 
                    girls in crypto run it. That s your 
                    code. 

      Sparks grabs the notebook back. Stares at it, brow furrowed. 

                                  SPARKS
                    Why do you--

                                  LAUREN
                    $2,341.39 for a plow? Steel prices 
                    have gone up, but not that much.

                                  SPARKS
                    I don t know.

                                  LAUREN
                    That s because you didn t spend high 
                    school making time with your future 
                    husband in his dad s machine shop.                                                                                      4.


                                  SPARKS
                          (completely distracted)
                    In a machine shop?

                                  LAUREN
                      Uncomfortable. And greasy. But that 
                    isn t the point. The point is I m 
                    right. Run it, you ll see. 

      She shoots a framed photo on her desk a conspiratorial grin.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Who d have thought being an old 
                    married lady would be so useful?

      Sparks watches her as she goes back to her typing. From the 
      look on his face, you d think he was jealous of a photograph. 
      And you d be right.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    I believe it s your line, Sparky.

                                  SPARKS
                          (covering)
                    I, ah, is the boss man in?

                                  LAUREN
                    Nope, he s got a big meeting with the 
                    Director. Won t be in for ages.

                                  SPARKS
                    In that case, wanna bail out on the 
                      paperwork, come with me to crypto?

      Lauren grins. She loves winning. 

                                  LAUREN
                    Give me five minutes and--

                                  ELLEN (O.S.)
                    Lauren, I need to talk to you.

      ELLEN OLSEN (25) enters, shuts the door behind her. 

      Usually, Ellen has a grand champion poker face and enjoys 
      using it, along with her dynamite curves, to her advantage.

      Today, she s fighting tears. 

                                  LAUREN
                    Ellen, what s wrong? Did something...

      Ellen answers her question by holding up a distinctive 
      MILITARY DEATH NOTIFICATION TELEGRAM. 

      Catching on quicker than Lauren--                                                                                      5.


                                  SPARKS
                    Oh. Christ.

                                  LAUREN
                          (oblivious)
                    That s the fourth one this week! Thank 
                    goodness you re pals with Betty over 
                    in Notifications. Can you imagine--

                                  ELLEN
                    Lauren...

                                  LAUREN
                    Whose is it, anyway?

      Ellen still can t bring herself to say it. Her eyes dart to 
      the framed photograph on Lauren s desk instead. 

      Lauren finally catches on. 

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    No. That isn t for me. 

      Ellen exchanges a helpless look with Sparks. 

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Don t make that face. That isn t mine.
                          (desperate)
                    Ellen. Please. 
                          (tears welling)
                    Tell me George isn t dead.

      But Ellen can t do that, and they all know it.


      It s a classic wake, from the jello mold to the white wreath 
      draped over a framed picture of a young man in uniform. We 
      can t quite see his face, but Lauren can.

      She stands, staring up at the picture. Alone in the crowd.

      Her face, as always, is an open book that shares every 
      thought with the world. 

      It's a sad story today. Nerves. Exhaustion. Grief.

      Across the room, Sparks pretends he s not watching her. 

      It isn t doing him any good. His heart might as well be 
      pinned to his sleeve. 

                                  ELLEN (O.S.)
                    You should just go over there. 

      Sparks turns to find Ellen standing beside him.                                                                                      6.


                                  SPARKS
                    It s her husband s wake, I can t--

                                  ELLEN
                    At least you admit it.

                                  SPARKS
                    I didn t admit--

      But he can t even maintain the argument. Not today.

                                  SPARKS (CONT D)
                    I just wish I could DO something.

                                  ELLEN 
                    Then find out what happened to George.

                                  SPARKS
                    You know I tried. 
                          (off her look)
                    The army is treating the incident as 
                    top secret, Ellen. That s above my 
                    security clearance. And yours. 

                                  ELLEN
                    Fine. You don t think you can manage 
                    it, I ll figure it out on my own.

                                  SPARKS
                    I know you think trading intel with 
                    your girlfriends is a gas, but--

                                  ELLEN
                    She needs to know, Sparks. 

                                  SPARKS
                    More like you want to know.

                                  ELLEN
                    Of course I do. One particular 
                    skirmish is tagged top secret out of a 
                      multi-island battle and you don t want 
                    to know why?

      He does, but...

                                  SPARKS
                    We will all have to live with 
                      disappointment. I don t wanna hear--

                                  ELLEN
                    Oh, don t worry. I wouldn t tell you 
                    now if you begged.

      With a toss of her hair, Ellen crosses to Lauren and wraps an 
      arm around her waist.                                                                                       7.


      Lauren leans into Ellen, eyes still lingering on the memorial 
      photograph of her husband. 

      From this angle, we can finally see the picture of Lauren s 
      husband, GEORGE, clearly. 

      He has a kind face. Nice blue eyes. He s handsome, but 
      unremarkable. 

      AND WE RECOGNIZE HIM. 

      The first time we met George Howl, he was floating dead in 
      the Pacific... 

      Of course, he isn t all that dead anymore.

      OFF George Howl s memorial photograph...


      THREE WEEKS LATER

      Lauren straightens her dress. Again. It's one of those days 
      when nothing feels like it fits quite right.

      The high-heeled, oxford shoes she eases her feet into are no 
      exception. Somebody s got blisters. Making a face as she ties 
      the laces...

                                  LAUREN
                    Ow ow ow. Damn you Hitler, I want my 
                    nylons back.

      Lauren straightens up and turns to the mirror. The girl who 
      looks back is stylish in a simple way. Pretty. Her hair isn t 
      quite right, but it never is.

      Satisfied, Lauren heads for the door. She stops at the 
      threshold and looks back at the girl in the mirror. 

      Is she ready for this? There s only one way to find out. 

      Lauren pulls the door open.


      Lauren takes the back stairs two at a time. She almost makes 
      it to the back door before --

                                  ESTHER HOWL (O.S.)
                    Where are you going? 

      Lauren turns to find her mother-in-law, MRS. ESTHER HOWL 
      (50 s), doing dishes at the sink. Esther is just as well kept 
      and old fashioned as her house.

                                  LAUREN
                    I m going to work, Mom Howl.

                                  ESTHER HOWL
                    So soon? 

                                  LAUREN
                    My boss has a lot to manage. The Nazis 
                    are--

                                  ESTHER HOWL
                    I see. Well, Father Tom is coming to 
                    the house today to say a special mass 
                    for George. He ll be disappointed, but 
                    I m sure he ll understand.                                                                                       9.


      She carefully places a clean plate in the drying rack.

                                  ESTHER HOWL (CONT D)
                    You have more important things to do.

      It s a swing and a hit. Guilt home run.

      Lauren gives up. She puts her handbag on the kitchen table 
      and starts rolling up her sleeves.

                                  LAUREN
                    I ll take care of the dishes. You go 
                    relax before Father Tom gets here. 
                    Close your eyes for a few minutes.

                                  ESTHER HOWL
                    No.

      Lauren stops mid-roll.

                                  ESTHER HOWL (CONT D)
                          (pointed)
                    A good wife puts her home and her 
                    family first. 

      Lauren can t decide whether to burst into tears or punch the 
      bitch. To avoid doing either, she grabs her purse and flees.


      The RECEPTIONIST doesn t even look up from her magazine when 
      Lauren steps off the elevator.

      It s a slow morning. The lobby is empty except for a little 
      boy, sitting alone. This is TEDDY MCNEIL (5). 

      Teddy is slight. Mildly disheveled. He s sketching something 
      in a composition book. 

      The intense focus on his face catches Lauren s curiosity. 

                                  LAUREN
                    You all by yourself, kiddo?

                                  TEDDY
                          (still drawing)
                    No. My dad went with Agent Harris.
                          (beat)
                    Agent Harris couldn t find his butt 
                    with two hands and a flashlight. 
                    That s what dad said.
                          (beat)
                    I wasn t supposed to be listening.

      Lauren smiles.                                                                                    10.


                                  LAUREN
                    That sounds like Harris, alright.

      Lauren should get to work... but she doesn t want to. 

      She sits next to Teddy instead. Catches a slant at his 
      notebook. 

      Teddy is drawing an elaborate AIRCRAFT. It s V winged, with 
      huge cylindrical engines. It looks like a plane, sort of.

      But there s something strange about it. Something... alien.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    What are you drawing?

                                  TEDDY
                    It took my sister.

                                  LAUREN
                    What do you mean, honey?

      Teddy stops long enough to point at the page with his pencil.

                                  TEDDY
                    That. It took my sister.

      Lauren looks from the picture to the little boy. Fascinated. 

      But before she can ask more questions --

                                  JOE (O.S.)
                    Right, Harris, I m sure you ll be in 
                    touch.

      Lauren looks up to see JOE MCNEIL (35) being half-shoved 
      through main doors by a portly guy who must be AGENT HARRIS.

      Joe is tall, too thin for his frame... and his suit. His eyes 
      are shadowed from more than just fatigue. He s also furious.

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    Guess you have to be a Lindbergh for 
                    the FBI to care when your kid gets 
                    snatched.

                                  HARRIS
                    Nope. If Lindbergh thought Martians 
                    had taken his kid, nobody would have 
                    given him the time of day either.

                                  JOE
                    Christ almighty, Harris. It obviously 
                    wasn t a SPACE ship.                                                                                     11.


                                  HARRIS
                    That s not what you said when you 
                    filed the report.

                                  JOE
                    I was out of my head that night and 
                    whatever that thing was... it sure as 
                    hell LOOKED like something straight 
                    out of a bad comic book.

                                  HARRIS
                    Well, it sure as hell sounds like a 
                    bad case of the DTs. 

                                  JOE
                    At least come and LOOK at what it did 
                    to the woods out behind--

                                  HARRIS
                    You sure you want that? I hear the 
                    local sheriff took a long look at 
                    those woods. And he still thinks you 
                    killed the girl. What if I find 
                    evidence that he s right?

                                  JOE
                    You won t.

                                  HARRIS
                    You so sure of that?

                                  JOE
                    SHE S NOT DEAD.

      Harris sighs. 

                                  HARRIS
                    No, she probably isn t. Your daughter 
                    ran away, McNeil. Face facts and stop 
                    wasting the FBI s time. 
                          (smirk)
                    There s a war on, remember? 

                                  JOE
                    I know. I ve been there.

      And you haven't. The unspoken accusation is sharp as glass. 

                                  HARRIS
                          (deeply insulted)
                    Defending the homeland is imperative 
                    to the war effort. And frivolous 
                    reports put our nation in jeopardy.

      With that, Harris marches back into the bull pen.                                                                                     12.


      Joe rips off his hat and hurls it at the ground.

                                  JOE
                          (near tears)
                    God damn it.

      Then he sweeps up his discarded hat and jams it on his head.

      Without even sparing Lauren a glance--

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    Come on Teddy, we re leaving.

      Joe jabs the elevator call button, waits impatiently. 

      Teddy looks up at his father, then back at Lauren. As the 
      elevator doors open, Teddy makes a decision. 

      He RIPS OUT the page he was drawing on, runs to Lauren and 
      thrusts the torn piece of paper into her hand.

      Teddy and Lauren lock eyes for a long beat. 

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    Theodore. Come here. NOW.

      This time, Teddy obeys.

      As the elevator doors close behind them, Lauren looks down at 
      the picture, still clutched in her hand.

      The sharp, V winged craft glowers back. It s rough, but 
      remarkably detailed for something dreamed up by a tiny boy...

      Lauren turns to the receptionist, who has been taking in the 
      commotion with avid interest.

                                  LAUREN
                    Who was that, Mabel?

                                  RECEPTIONIST A.K.A. MABEL
                    Oh, that s Mr. McNeil. He might be a 
                    looker but he s totally screwy.
                          (shakes her head)
                    He s been in here causing a fuss every 
                    other day since his daughter ran off.

                                  LAUREN
                    They re sure she ran away?

      Mabel nods, eager to share her juicy gossip.                                                                                    13.


                                  MABEL
                    Oh, yes. Agent Harris told me, 
                      completely confidentially of course, 
                    that McNeil had JUST taken custody of 
                    the children from their grandparents 
                    and the girl HATED him for it. 
                          (tisk)
                    Poor lamb s mother died while he was 
                    fighting in Europe, you see.

                                  LAUREN
                    How sad.

                                  MABEL
                          (she loves it)
                    Dreadful. 
                          (suddenly realizing...)
                    I thought you were on leave for 
                    another two weeks, Lauren. What are 
                    you doing back so soon? 

      Lauren folds up Teddy s picture, slips it into her purse.

                                  LAUREN
                    The boss man needs me. 

                                  MABEL
                    You re so brave. If I was married and 
                    my husband died, I m sure I wouldn t 
                    be able to get out of bed for weeks.

      Husband died. The words bring a lump to Lauren s throat. She 
      swallows hard, pushing the grief back. Fakes a bright smile.

                                  LAUREN
                    I make do. Besides...
                          (echoing Harris)
                    There s a war on, remember? 

      With that she marches for the main doors.


      The place is already hopping. A regular whirlwind of bobbed 
      hair, pencil skirts and worse for wear three-piece suits. 

      Lauren weaves through the chaos, ignoring the shock wave of 
      whispers and sympathetic looks that follows her. 

      Sparks sprawls at his desk. Lauren catches his eye, but he 
      plays busy, shuffling papers. The snub hurts, but before she 
      can process it --

                                  ELLEN (O.S.)
                    What s a nice dame like you doing in a 
                    place like this?                                                                                    14.


      Lauren turns to find Ellen, heading her way.

                                  LAUREN
                    Didn t have anywhere else to be. What 
                    are you doing on this floor?

      Ellen hooks her arm through Lauren s and they keep walking.

                                  ELLEN
                    Just came to see you settled. 

                                  LAUREN
                    You re a pal.

                                  ELLEN
                      Occasionally.

      They stop in front of a door labeled SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE. 

      Abruptly, Ellen pulls Lauren into a tight hug. She clings for 
      a moment, then, just as abruptly, steps away. 

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                          (covering)
                    Besides, your dear boss won t let 
                    anyone else touch his files. So when 
                    you re not here... this happens.

      Ellen pushes the door open and they cross into--


      It s a disaster zone of files, microfiche and evidence bags. 

      But Lauren doesn't see the mess. Her eyes go straight to the 
      framed photograph buried in the paperwork rubble on the desk.

      It s George, of course. That smile used to be comforting. 
      Today, it s heartbreaking. 

      A tear slips down Lauren s cheek. Then another. 

      She can't have this. 

      Lauren opens a drawer and lays the frame inside. She looks 
      down at it for a long beat. Then she firmly shuts it away.

                                  ELLEN
                    You sure you re ready to be back? I 
                    can talk to-- 

                                  LAUREN
                    No! I... I need to be here. I just... 
                    I need to work. 

      Ellen nods. She gets it. Paints on an affectionate scowl--                                                                                    15.


                                  ELLEN
                    Then you best stop dawdling and get 
                    started, hadn t you?

                                  LAUREN
                          (grateful)
                    Dawdle? Me? Never.

      Ellen heads for the door, then turns back. 

                                  ELLEN
                    You have plans tonight?

                                  LAUREN
                    Other than avoiding my mother-in-law? 
                    No, not especially.

                                  ELLEN
                    Good. Be ready at 5:30. We re taking a 
                    little field trip. There s someone I 
                    want you to meet.

      And with that mysterious declaration, she sweeps out.

      Instead of digging into the mess that s taken over her 
      office, Lauren pulls Teddy s picture from her bag and unfolds 
      it, smoothing it on her desk. Stares down at it, intrigued.

      OFF the child s sketch...


      We re close on a photograph. It s old. Worn around the edges 
      with much handling. But... 

      IT S DEFINITELY THE SAME AIRCRAFT TEDDY DREW. A V winged 
      monster with enormous, cylindrical engines. Bright and 
      menacing, even through the faded, cracking sepia.

      From now on, we ll just call it... THE SHIP.

      The photograph is one of a half a dozen pictures sprawled 
      across the chest of MAX HARTMAN (40 s). 

      Max is passed out on his couch. He s dressed in yesterday s 
      shirt and tie. A mostly empty bottle of rye sits on the 
      coffee table beside him.

      He s the kind of man you want to like, even when he s stone 
      drunk. He just has one of those faces.

      As Max snores, we study the pictures:

      The ship. And the churned up crater around it. The soil 
      beneath it, bleached white by heat. Tree roots, thrust 
      skyward from trees that have been BLOWN out of the ground.                                                                                    16.


      The phone rings. 

      Max startles awake, reflexively swinging a LUGER PISTOL up, 
      aiming it at the front door. 

      Whoa. Passed out drunk AND armed? Who is this guy?

      The phone rings again and Max realizes what woke him. Lowers 
      his gun. Checks his watch. 

                                  MAX
                    Oh, hell.

      Max scrambles for the phone. 

                                  MAX (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Hartman here.
                          (listens)
                    No. I ll be there in twenty minutes.

      He hangs up. Gathers his wits. Checks his watch again, 
      swears. Sniffs himself. It ll have to do. 

      He sweeps up the scattered pictures, moving fast... until he 
      hits the last photograph. 

      This one is not like the others. It shows a much younger Max, 
      grinning down at a beautiful woman and a little girl. A man 
      with his whole world in his arms.

      The picture brings a complex smile to Max s face. Love, mixed 
      in equal measure with sadness and guilt.

                                  MAX (CONT D)
                          (whispered)
                    My sweet Liesel. 

      But he s late. No time for sad memories. 

      Max puts the pictures in A SECRET COMPARTMENT built into one 
      corner of his fireplace. 

      Then he grabs a bundle of AMERICAN DOLLARS from the mantel 
      and puts it on top of the pictures. A bundle of BRITISH 
      POUNDS comes next, and another of SWISS FRANCS. 

      Passports for four different countries, two boxes of BULLETS 
      and the slim Luger pistol follow.

      Whoever he is, he s ready to disappear at a moment s notice.

      Max closes the secret compartment carefully, then grabs his 
      briefcase and his fedora and dashes out the front door.                                                                                    17.



      Lauren, arms piled precariously high with file folders, 
      pushes through the half open door and straight into an 
      exiting Sparks.

      Files, everywhere.

                                  SPARKS
                    Christ, you spooked me. 

                                  LAUREN
                    I spooked you?
                          (gestures to the floor)
                    Do you know how long those took to 
                      alphabetize? 

      She kneels to gather the wreckage. Sparks crouches to help.

      Silence. 

      This is awkward as hell...

                                  SPARKS
                    How are you?

                                  LAUREN
                    Fine. 

                                  SPARKS
                    Oh. Good. 

      Silence again. It stretches out, smothering. Until--

                                  LAUREN
                    You avoiding me all day helps, 
                      obviously.                                                                                     18.


                                  SPARKS
                          (lying)
                    I have not been avoiding you.

                                  LAUREN
                    It s almost lunch. Since when are you 
                    not in my office jawing about 
                    something or other at least three 
                    times before noon?

                                  SPARKS
                    I just... I didn t know what to say. I 
                    didn t know whether you d want me to 
                    say anything. Whether you d want me...

                                  LAUREN 
                    Of course I want...

      Suddenly, Lauren has no idea what she wants. 

      She stops sorting and looks up at him, at a loss. Finally--

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    I want everything to be normal. Just 
                    for a little while. Please?

      Sparks takes a deep breath. Normal. He can do that. Maybe.

                                  SPARKS
                          (tentative)
                    So bereavement leave. Real morale 
                    booster, I take it? 

                                  LAUREN
                    Oh yeah, between Mrs. Peterson force 
                    feeding me potato salad and my mother-
                    in-law weeping about how she ll never 
                    have grandchildren... 
                          (watery laugh)
                    It s really too bad they can t bottle 
                    it and send it to the troops.

                                  SPARKS
                    It sounds awful.

                                  LAUREN
                    Yeah. It was. 

      A long, quiet moment. An old bond rebuilding itself. A true 
      connection, perhaps more intense now than either remembers. 

                                  SPARKS
                    The big man is out of the office 
                    today, right?                                                                                    19.


                                  LAUREN
                      Indefinitely, apparently. He s on a 
                      classified assignment.

                                  SPARKS
                    In that case, how about I buy you 
                    dinner? I promise it won t be potato 
                    salad.

                                  LAUREN
                    Ellen beat you to it. Rain check?

                                  SPARKS
                    Deal. See you around, kid.

                                  LAUREN
                    Not if I see you first.

      They exchange a good natured eye roll and Sparks heads out.

      Lauren gathers up her stack of files. Eyes a little brighter. 
      One more piece of her world back in place. 

      But instead of putting the folders away, she abandons them on 
      a work-counter and crosses to a filing cabinet on the other 
      side of the room.

      She pulls out a slim file and starts to read. 

      Soon she s engrossed. Work forgotten. 

      What could be so fascinating? 

      Then we see the file s label: MCNEIL, JOSEPH.

      Lauren lingers over a school portrait of MARLEY MCNEIL. 

      Marley is about half way to being a stunner. At 15, her big 
      dark eyes and curly black hair are still on the awkward side 
      of striking, but she ll grow into them... 

      If she gets the chance to grow up.

      Lauren sighs. Goes to close the folder... and then something 
      on the page behind Marley s picture catches her eye. 

      A box labeled SPECIAL PROJECT CODE. 

      Stamped inside it, just one word: HORIZON

      OFF Lauren s intent, puzzled face...

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    20.


                                        ACT TWO


      Tasteful and feminine. Stylish in an old money way. 

                                  MRS. PIERCE
                    Anna will be thrilled to see you, 
                    darling.

                                  MAX
                    I hope so.

      The hall widens ahead of them into --


      It's delicate. Refined. Elegant. 

      The room is mostly populated with gorgeous women in lingerie. 
      They're elegant too, but they're definitely whores.

                                  MRS. PIERCE
                    I'll just find her.

                                  MAX
                    Thank you, Mrs. Pierce.

      Max settles into a chair and pretends he isn t listening to 
      the large, red faced gentleman on the sofa across from him.

                                  INDISCRETE GENTLEMAN
                    We keep files on everyone you know. 
                    You should HEAR the hijinks that some 
                    very, very interesting names have been 
                    up to.                                                                                    21.


      The plump whore he's chatting up giggles, impressed.

                                    GIGGLER
                    Shock me, darling. I can take it.

      Max s casual eavesdropping is interrupted by a delicate white 
      hand on his shoulder. It belongs to ANNA WEBER, 26. 

      Anna is the best possible combination of Veronica Lake, Grace 
      Kelly and Sophia Loren. 

                                  LENA
                    Max. I ve been looking forward to 
                    seeing you all day.

      Max smiles up at her.

                                  MAX
                          (not entirely true)
                    The feeling is mutual, my dear.

                                  ANNA
                    Let s leave Loose Lips here to tell 
                    Mata Hari what he knows, shall we?

      Indiscreet heard that. He blushes fiercely. Glares in her 
      direction but she's already leading Max away.


      Silk sheets. Blood red roses. Beautiful, but just a touch 
      aggressive.

      Anna closes and locks the door behind them. Then her body 
      language changes. Back straight. Eyes sharp. All business, 
      and not the business we thought she was in.

      SHE SPEAKS TO HIM IN GERMAN.

                                  ANNA
                    You re late.

      Max replies in the same language.

                                  MAX
                    Replacing Esman has been time 
                      consuming. We needed the new man in 
                    place before the next submarine drop.

      It s all starting to make sense now... 

      The gun. The variety pack of passports and cash. The talking 
      about submarines in German with mysterious prostitutes.

      Max Hartman is a Nazi spy.                                                                                    22.


                                  ANNA
                    I trust you have taken care of it?

                                  MAX
                    Of course. 
                          (switching to English)
                    Stop being coy, Anna. Why am I here?

                                  ANNA
                          (in English)
                    There's been a sighting.

      Max crosses to the small bar in the corner and pours a stiff 
      drink. He slugs it back and pours another. Bracing himself.

                                  MAX
                    I know. In Virginia. Fifteen miles 
                    outside the city. 
                          (deeply bitter)
                    They took Joseph McNeil s daughter, 
                    right in front of his eyes.

                                  ANNA
                          (jaw dropped)
                    You knew that the Auslanders had 
                    returned? And you didn t report it?

                                  MAX
                    What was there to report? They took 
                    another girl and returned to the stars 
                    from which they came. 

                                  ANNA
                    And if they come back?

                                  MAX
                    They didn t come back last time. 

                                  ANNA
                    That was then. This is now. The 
                    Americans CANNOT be allowed to make 
                    contact before we establish--

                                  MAX
                    I know. And the best way to achieve 
                    that, in this case, is to do nothing. 

      Max takes a deep breath, trying to ease his temper. 

                                  MAX (CONT D)
                    The FBI is sure it s a hoax and the 
                    local sheriff believes that McNeil 
                    killed the girl himself.

      Max shakes his head, pity in his eyes. 

      Anna clocks it. She disapproves.                                                                                    23.


                                  ANNA
                    Be that as it may, we ll need to erase 
                    the incident. Completely. The family 
                    will have to be eliminated. 

                                  MAX
                    That s unnecessary. Joseph McNeil will 
                    be forgotten, all on his own. Without 
                    me lifting a finger.

                                  ANNA
                    The Gestapo disagree.

      Max fights the urge to say something he ll regret. Finally--

                                  MAX
                    There are days when I regret agreeing 
                    to this arrangement.

                                  ANNA
                    As though you had a choice. 

                                  MAX
                    You are very young, Anna. Your view of 
                    Germany is... simplistic.

      She stands and stalks across the room, going toe to toe with 
      him. In her three inch heels, she can look him in the eye.

                                  ANNA
                    There is nothing wrong with 
                      simplicity. 
                          (beat)
                      I wouldn't like to think I was wrong 
                    when I told the Gestapo that you were 
                    loyal to the Reich.

                                  MAX
                    I have been serving Germany longer 
                    than you have been alive. You actually 
                    presume to question my loyalty?

                                  ANNA
                    Yes. I do.

      Sparking tension. 

      Then Max cracks the moment with a wry smile.

                                  MAX
                    Relax, Anna. I've been living with the 
                    Americans for a long time. Believe me, 
                    my faith in the superiority of the 
                    German people is quite secure.

      He lifts his hat from the bar, places it back on his head and 
      reaches for the door. As he pulls it open --                                                                                    24.


                                  ANNA
                    If you don t take care of the McNeil 
                    family, we will. 

      Max hesitates. Then steps out and closes the door behind him.


      A lovely room, gone hollow with disuse. It s so quiet in here 
      that Joe and Teddy look like intruders perched at the table. 

      Teddy isn't even pretending to eat. Joe can't blame him. The 
      mushy casserole in front of them is... mushy.

      Guilt, doubt, annoyance, despair. All in Joe's face as he 
      watches Teddy poke at his food. 

      The doorbell rings. Relieved, Joe jumps to his feet.

                                  JOE
                    Finish your dinner.


      Joe opens the door. EDWARD TYRELL, ESQ., 55, rumpled despite 
      the nice suit, stands outside.

                                  JOE
                    Ed. Have you heard something? The FBI--

                                  ED
                    Hello to you too, Joe.

                                  ED (CONT D)
                    Nina made cookies.
                          (raising his voice)
                    Anyone in there that likes cookies?

      In a flash, Teddy is standing between them. Ed grins. Hands 
      him a large brown bag that is clearly full of cookies.

                                  JOE
                    Theodore! I told you to finish your 
                    dinner.

      Teddy looks up at his father. Solemn. He doesn't really have 
      to say it, does he?

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    Fine. You can have one now, but save 
                    the rest. We'll walk down to the diner 
                    after I talk to Ed.

                                  ED
                          (with a wink to Teddy)
                    If you have two, he'll never know.                                                                                    25.


      Joe rolls his eyes.

                                  JOE
                    Maybe not, but if you spoil your 
                    dinner, I ll...
                          (fumbling for a threat)
                    I ll make you eat the leftover 
                    casserole for lunch tomorrow.

      Teddy considers that. Nods.

                                  TEDDY
                    One cookie. One cookie is good.

      Ed laughs as Teddy and the cookies disappear into the house. 

      The moment he s gone--

                                  JOE
                    What s going on, Ed? 
                          (off Ed s silence)
                    Come on. You didn t burn a hole in 
                    your gas ration just to deliver 
                    cookies.

                                  ED
                    The Petersons have filed a custody 
                    suit. They re using Sheriff Ford s 
                      investigation to prove you re unfit.

      Joe fights the sudden impulse to vomit.

                                  JOE
                    I m not going to lose a second child 
                    because Ford lacks the imagination to 
                    look past the end of his nose. I ll--

                                  ED
                    You shouldn t fight this.

      Joe stares at him, thunderstruck.

                                  ED (CONT D)
                    I m serious, Joe. 

                                  JOE
                    They re trying to take my kid, Ed. 

                                  ED
                    They are his grandparents. 

                                  JOE
                    And he s my son.

                                  ED
                    Is he?                                                                                     26.


      They re both shocked Ed said that out loud. 

      Joe twists to make sure Teddy isn t lurking. Shuts the door 
      behind himself, just in case.

                                  ED (CONT D)
                    Cripes. I m sorry, Joe. I... 
                          (shakes his head)
                    No, actually I m not sorry. It needed 
                    to be said. You and I both know that 
                    boy isn t yours.

                                  JOE
                    We don t know that for sure.

                                  ED
                    You were sure, the day you enlisted. 
                    That s why you went, after all.

      Joe closes his eyes for a moment. Even the memory hurts.

                                  ED (CONT D)
                    I m sorry, Joe. But we both know you d 
                    be better off without a child to worry 
                    about.

      Joe stares out into the summer evening for a long beat. 
      Thinking. Temptation gnawing at him. Finally --

                                  JOE
                    That doesn t matter.

                                  ED
                    It doesn t? 

                                  JOE
                    Teddy believes that I m his father.

                                  ED
                    I know he does, Joe. But maybe the boy 
                    deserves the truth.

                                  JOE
                    I m not going to tell Teddy he's the 
                    bastard of a married man who won t 
                      acknowledge his existence. I can t.

                                  ED
                    That still doesn t make him your 
                      responsibility.

                                  JOE
                    Yes, it does. 

      End of story.                                                                                    27.


      Ed sighs. He s seen that look on Joe s face before.

                                  ED
                    Okay you stubborn, honorable S.O.B. 
                    We ll fight. But you better pray for a 
                    miracle. We re gonna need it.


      Lauren and Ellen walk down a long hallway that runs through 
      the temporary structure. The sound of female voices and 
      typewriters clacking echoes through the corrugated tin walls.

      Ellen is in mid-cigarette and mid-story.

                                  ELLEN
                    You should have seen his face. I did 
                    this --

      She demonstrates a flirty wave.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    -- and I thought he was going to 
                    faint. Good Lord, I was there with a 
                    date. What was I going to do, run up 
                    and introduce myself to that blue 
                    nosed wife of his?

                                  LAUREN
                      I wouldn't put it past you.

                                  ELLEN
                    Neither would I.

      That actually earns her a laugh. Lauren's first in a while.

                                  LAUREN
                    Okay, enough stalling. What are we 
                    doing here?

      Ellen throws her friend a sidelong glance. Takes a drag on 
      her cigarette. Uncharacteristically hesitant.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    What is it, Ellen? Is something wrong?

      Ellen stops, turns back to Lauren.

                                  ELLEN
                    Remember that doctor I was seeing? The 
                    one who turned out to have three other 
                      girlfriends and a wife?

                                  LAUREN
                    You aren't seeing him again, are you? 
                    Ellen, he's --                                                                                    28.


                                  ELLEN
                    No, no. I am not THAT dizzy a dame.

      She takes another drag.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    But I got to be pals with one of the 
                      girlfriends, Cherry Delaney.
                          (beat)
                    She works here, at the war department.  
                    If there s something to know about the 
                    Pacific theater... Cherry knows it.

      Lauren jumps straight to the right conclusion.

                                  LAUREN
                    Even... 
                          (off Ellen s nod)
                    I thought George s file was marked top 
                    secret.

                                  ELLEN
                    Cherry has Top Secret clearance.

      Lauren sucks in a breath, suddenly shaky. Ellen clocks it.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    Are you sure you want to hear this, 
                    Lauren? You don t have to, you know.

      Lauren isn t sure. Not even a little bit. But...

                                  LAUREN
                    I don t want to. I need to. 

                                  ELLEN
                    Then there s no time like the present.


      Lauren and Ellen step into a wide, low room. It s a sea of 
      young women in bulky headphones, hammering at typewriters.

      These GOVERNMENT GIRLS are young, single and smart... imagine 
      the cast of GOSSIP GIRL with the fate of WWII literally at 
      their fingertips and you ve got the right idea.

      A tiny redhead walks the room like a drill sergeant. This is 
      CHERRY DELANEY. Ellen waves her over. 

                                  CHERRY DELANEY 
                    Ellen! Doll!

                                  ELLEN
                    Hello, dear. 
                          (re: Lauren)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    29.

                                  ELLEN (CONT'D)
                    Remember that friend of mine who 
                    wanted to talk to you?

      Cherry looks at Lauren. Shrugs.

                                  CHERRY
                    Not here! Come on.

      Lauren and Ellen follow Cherry to a door in the back of the 
      room. They step into--


      It s quieter in here, but only just. Cherry extends a hand to 
      Lauren for a firm shake.

                                  CHERRY
                    Cherry Delaney. Lieutenant, WAC.

                                  LAUREN
                    Lauren Howl. Secretary, FBI.

      Cherry chuckles. Gives Lauren a once over. Her eyes are 
      friendly, but they don t miss a thing. 

                                  CHERRY
                          (to Ellen)
                      Trustworthy?

                                  ELLEN
                    Trust her with my life.

                                  CHERRY
                    She s the one whose sweetie died at 
                    Tulagi, right?

                                  ELLEN
                    Right. The files have been marked Top 
                    Secret and--

                                  CHERRY
                    Of course they have. They don t want a 
                    soul to know about that plane.

                                  LAUREN
                    Plane?

                                  CHERRY
                    Some kind of new Jap bomber. Thus the 
                    hush hush. Gotta keep it quiet until 
                    we figure out what that thing can do. 

      Cherry grabs a pack of cigarettes. As she lights one--                                                                                    30.


                                  CHERRY (CONT D)
                    It s top priority. Already has it s 
                    own special project code and 
                      everything. Horizon.

      Wait. WHAT? Did she just say...

                                  LAUREN
                    Horizon?

                                  CHERRY
                    Yeah. Odd one, huh?

                                  LAUREN
                    Do you know what it looks like? The 
                    bomber, I mean.

                                  CHERRY
                    Sure. The survivors said it had V 
                    shaped wings, like a knife. And it s 
                    bigger than a B-17. Huge engines. 

                                  LAUREN
                      Propellers?

                                  CHERRY
                    No. Big tubes, stuck to the back. 
                          (shakes her head)
                    The way they described it... sounded 
                    like something H.G. Wells made up.

      Sound familiar? Lauren thinks so too. 

      She drags a piece of folded paper from her bag. TEDDY 
      MCNEIL S DRAWING. She unfolds it and holds it up.

                                  LAUREN
                    Something like this?

      Ellen and Cherry stare at the sketch, jaw dropped.

                                  CHERRY
                    Where the devil did you get that?

                                  LAUREN
                    There s a man, Joseph McNeil. He 
                    claims a huge plane landed in the 
                    woods behind his house in Virginia 
                    last week and took his daughter. 
                          (beat)
                    His son drew this. From memory.

                                  ELLEN
                    Isn t McNeil the one who thinks 
                    Martians took his kid?                                                                                    31.


                                  LAUREN
                    So? Look at the picture! McNeil might 
                    think it s a space ship, but it s the 
                    same plane that killed George. 

                                  CHERRY
                    Seems like a stretch.

                                  LAUREN
                    Yeah, it would be. If the McNeil file 
                    didn t have a special project code.

                                  ELLEN
                          (catching on)
                    No way.

                                  LAUREN
                    Yes. The McNeil file is coded HORIZON.

                                  CHERRY
                    But... if that s the same plane that 
                    killed those boys in the Pacific--

                                  ELLEN
                    -- that means the Axis are slipping 
                    past our borders and nobody knows.

                                  LAUREN
                    Somebody knows. Somebody assigned that 
                    code. And I m going to find out who.

                                  CHERRY
                    How? It could be FBI, Department of 
                    Defense, Army, Navy--

                                  ELLEN
                    There are an awful lot of rocks to 
                    turn over, kiddo.

      Lauren stares down at the picture, brain running hot... 

                                  LAUREN
                    No, there aren t. The McNeil file 
                    didn t get past our office. Harris 
                    barely investigated it, for pity sake. 
                    That means --

                                  ELLEN
                    The code is FBI.

      Lauren stuffs Teddy s picture back in her purse.

                                  LAUREN
                    All I have to do is find out which 
                    agent tagged the McNeil file. Whoever 
                    it is, he ll know what Horizon means.                                                                                    32.


      She reaches for the door. Ellen gets in her way.

                                  ELLEN
                    You can't tell ANYONE what you heard 
                    here. You know that right? Not even 
                    Sparks. Sharing classified material --

                                  LAUREN
                    -- is treason. I know. But there's got 
                    to be another way to make them put it 
                    together. I just have to find it.

      With that she ducks around Ellen and dashes off.

                                  ELLEN
                          (calling after her)
                    Don't do anything stupid!
                          (to herself)
                    Who am I kidding? It's Lauren. She's 
                    going to do something stupid.

      And Ellen s grin says she can't wait to see what it is.

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    33.


                                      ACT THREE


      From behind his paper, GEORGE HOWL watches Anna go. He 
      doesn t move to follow her. He s waiting for... 

      Max strides up the path, every muscle tense with purpose. He 
      jumps into a nondescript black Ford and roars away.

      As soon as Max turns the corner, George puts his idling car 
      in gear and follows him.


      Joe stands at the window. He s watching Teddy, who sits on 
      the porch steps outside, drawing in the summer sunshine.

      There are only a few feet between them, but the distance 
      feels like miles. 

      Joe is about to turn away when a SHERIFF S CAR pulls into the 
      driveway. A YOUNG DEPUTY gets out.                                                                                    35.


      Joe hurries to the door.


      Lauren Howl - just the girl Joe is wishing for... if she ever 
      gets the chance to ask the questions. 

      Sparks is trying to out pace Lauren as they clip down the 
      hall. It's not working.

                                  SPARKS
                    No. Absolutely not.                                                                                    36.


                                  LAUREN
                    Why not? I'm trying to help you here, 
                    Sparks. The McNeil case could be huge.

                                  SPARKS
                    Or it could make me into a huge yuck.

                                  LAUREN
                    The thing practically landed on top of 
                    the White House.

                                  SPARKS
                    True. If the White House was in the 
                    woods. In Virginia. In the drunken 
                    fantasies of some hick.

                                  LAUREN
                          (ignoring him)
                    Obviously it's not a spaceship. But it 
                    COULD have been an, um...

      Vague. Must be vague. But not too vague...

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    ...Axis spy plane. On American soil. 
                    If you bring THAT in, you could write 
                    your ticket.

      That hits its mark. Sparks considers. Maybe... Nah.

                                  SPARKS
                    It's a hoax, Lauren. 

                                  LAUREN
                    SOMETHING took that girl.

      They stop in front of the SAC s office.

                                  SPARKS
                    Nothing snatched that girl. She ran 
                    away, or her father killed her.
                          (hesitates)
                    Look, I know things are bad right now--

                                  LAUREN
                    Don't.

      The fragile edges of her recovery are abruptly visible.

      He nods. Fighting the impulse to pull her close and hold her 
      until the brittleness fades. 

      Instead, he course corrects away from the sore spot.

                                  SPARKS
                    Don't you have something better to do 
                    than bully me into wild goose chases?                                                                                    37.


                                  LAUREN
                          (relieved)
                    I do not "bully" you. I encourage.

                                  SPARKS
                    Sure.

                                  LAUREN
                    You got promoted over a case I 
                     bullied  you into. Are you really 
                    telling me you'd rather I just file 
                    these things away?

                                  SPARKS
                    Filing IS your job, Sunshine.

                                  LAUREN
                    I didn't say it wasn't, Sparkles.

                                    SPARKS/LAUREN
                    DON'T CALL ME SPARKLES.

      She laughs. Sparks glares. It's a good thing he would never 
      hit a girl.

      Lauren pushes her door open. Turns back for one last try.

                                  LAUREN
                    Sparks, I really think--

                                  SPARKS
                    I know you do. And I know you need... 
                      something, right now. But chasing Joe 
                    McNeil's Martians isn't it.

      In a moment of daring he reaches out and takes her hand.

                                  SPARKS (CONT D)
                    If you really want to see a spaceship 
                    that badly, I'll take you to the 
                    movies. I'll even spring for popcorn.

      She stares down at their entwined fingers, finally catching 
      on to his feelings. 

      She s overwhelmed. Confused. Not ready for this. 

      And being Lauren, she can't hide a second of it from him.

      Sparks drops her hand. Covering for the sting of rejection, 
      his tone is sharper than he means it to be.

                                  SPARKS (CONT D)
                    This case is a bad apple. Let it rot.

      He pushes past her down the hall. Lauren starts to call after 
      him, then stops. What would she say?                                                                                     38.


      OFF her frustrated face....


      Lauren tries to focus on her typing. It s not working.

      She opens the drawer she banished George s picture to. Looks 
      her dead husband in the eye. Guilt washes over her.

                                  LAUREN
                    There's nothing you can do about it, 
                    Lauren.

      She firmly closes the drawer. Starts typing again.

      But we linger as she clatters away. Waiting. Because any 
      second now...

      Lauren stops typing, shoves herself back from her desk and 
      half runs for the door. Bursting out, into the--


      Lauren darts through the usual chaos, heading for the--


      Lauren slams the door behind her and bee-lines for a 
      particular filing cabinet. She yanks out a familiar, slim 
      folder. THE MCNEIL FILE.

      Lauren flips it open to the last page. To the Special Project 
      Code box... to that one, mysterious word: HORIZON

      OFF Lauren as she stares down at it... and idea brewing.


      ONE WEEK LATER

      The office is clean. Orderly. The picture of George is back 
      in place on Lauren's desk. Business as usual reestablished, 
      except for the small bouquet of flowers beside the photo.

      Sparks sprawls in the guest chair.

      Lauren pointedly ignores him. Types at light speed, eyes on 
      the steno pad full of short hand she's transcribing.

                                  SPARKS
                    You're really just going to leave me 
                    in suspense?

      Yup. Definitely.

                                  SPARKS (CONT D)
                    That girl just reappears from thin 
                    air, and you didn t see a thing?

      Lauren finishes her page with a flourish. Yanks it free.

                                  LAUREN
                    She didn t reappear from thin air.

                                  SPARKS
                    Then what happened?

                                  LAUREN
                    Read the report.

                                  SPARKS
                    The report is all wet and you know it.

                                    ,LAUREN
                    Yes I do. But you called the case a 
                    waste of time, so I'm not going to 
                    waste any more of your time jawing 
                    about it.

                                  SPARKS
                    Lauren.

                                  LAUREN
                    Sparks.

      The spike of fire is there. She can t pretend not to see it 
      anymore. If only she had a clue what to do about it.                                                                                    53.


                                  ELLEN (O.S.)
                    Aren t you two just a picture.

      Ellen saunters in, breaking the moment.

                                  SPARKS
                    What? No. We, ah... we were just 
                      discussing the McNeil case.

                                  LAUREN
                    If you want to call Sparks begging me 
                    for details, "discussing."

                                  SPARKS
                    I was not begging.

                                  ELLEN
                    Poor thing. You didn't get to see the 
                    pretty spaceship and now you're 
                    pouting.
                          (artfully casual)
                    Of course, if I was you, I'd be more 
                    curious about the flowers than the 
                    Martians.

      Sparks' eyes shoot to the bouquet. Suddenly aware of the 
      possibility that --

                                  SPARKS
                    Are they from him? From McNeil?

                                  LAUREN
                    No. That would be totally 
                      inappropriate.

                                  ELLEN
                    They're from the kids. Aren t they 
                    lovely?

      She shoots Sparks an arch look that couldn't be clearer. If 
      you want her, better go get her. Now.

      Before Sparks can figure out how to answer that challenge, a 
      voice from behind him:

                                  MAX (O.S.)
                    Yes, Ellen, they are quite lovely. Who 
                    sent them to you, my dear?

      Sparks snaps out of the chair as...

      MAX HARTMAN steps into the room and crosses to the door 
      behind Lauren s desk.

      When he pulls it open, we finally see the words that are 
      stenciled on the door s pebbled glass window:                                                                                    54.


      SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE: MAX HARTMAN

      Holy. Christ. 

      Max Hartman the Nazi spy...

      Is also a SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE at the FBI. 

      MAX HARTMAN is Lauren s boss. 

                                  LAUREN
                    Oh, hello sir. They re from a family I 
                    helped out--

      Then she notices that Max is in a bad way. He s bruised. 
      Limping. Suit and shirt a dead loss. 

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Are you all right? We haven t heard 
                    from you in more than a week and now--

      Max gives her an affectionate, exhausted smile. 

                                  MAX
                          (lying convincingly)
                    Don t fuss, I m fine. The assignment 
                    went longer than expected, that s all. 
                    I am sorry I couldn't contact you. 

      Ellen, Sparks and Lauren exchange a concerned glance.

                                  ELLEN
                    Maybe we should--

                                  SPARKS
                    --go. Yes. We should.

      Max waves them off.

                                  MAX
                    No need to run off on my account. I'm 
                    sure you young people have plans.

                                  LAUREN
                    I can stay. If you need me.

                                  MAX
                    No, no. Go! Enjoy your evening. I will 
                    see you in the morning.

      He moves into his office, letting the door swing not-quite 
      closed behind him.

                                  ELLEN
                          (to Lauren)
                    Come on. We re gonna be late.                                                                                    55.


                                  LAUREN
                    I don t know... the boss man looked 
                    pretty beat up, maybe I should stay.

                                  SPARKS
                    He ll be fine. You just want to tell 
                    him all about Joe McNeil s Martians.  

      Lauren looks up at Max s nearly closed door. Ellen isn t 
      wrong... but then she shakes her head.

                                  LAUREN
                    Joe doesn t want the FBI involved.

                                  SPARKS
                    I knew it! I knew something happened 
                    out there.

      With a pointed look at Sparks, Ellen ignores his outburst.

                                  ELLEN
                          (to Lauren)
                    So we re calling him Joe now?

                                  LAUREN
                    He saved my life, I saved his kid. I 
                    think first names are called for.

                                  SPARKS
                    Okay, will someone PLEASE put me out 
                    of my misery and tell me what happened 
                    to Marley McNeil?

                                  LAUREN
                    No. 

      Lauren pulls the dust cover over her typewriter and slips 
      into her coat. 

      As she packs up, we drift into--


      Where Max Hartman sits in his desk chair, listening to his 
      secretary and her friends gossip about the case his Nazi 
      superiors ordered him to bury. 

      The family he was meant to kill.

      The look on his face is beyond complicated.

                                  SPARKS (O.S.)
                    I ll buy you a drink.

                                  ELLEN (O.S.)
                    You ll buy both of us a drink. And 
                    dinner.                                                                                    56.


      As their banter fades up the hall, Max reaches into his 
      briefcase and pulls out a WAR DEPARTMENT FILE. 

      The label reads: GEORGE HOWL, DECEASED.

      Max puts the file on his desk. 

      He stares down at it for a long beat. Then he flips the file 
      open and begins to read.  


      The teacher's monotone buzzes in the background. Something 
      about the Roman Empire.

      Marley isn t paying attention. Her eyes, and her mind, are 
      somewhere beyond the big picture windows.

      Is she daydreaming? 

      No. She s focused. Staring at something just outside. 

      Or someone.

      We pull back, following her gaze through the glass --
