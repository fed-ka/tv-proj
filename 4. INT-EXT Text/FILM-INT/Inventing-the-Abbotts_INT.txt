ELEANOR ABBOTT gathers some books from her locker.
Eleanor is sixteen, outgoing, sarcastic, and very
popular. She is the middle of the three Abbott
daughters. Eleanor closes her locker, turns and
discovers Jacey standing behind her. He follows her down
the busy hall.
JACEY
I tried to call you last night but
the line was busy.
ELEANOR
No it wasn't.

JACEY
It was busy all night.
ELEANOR
Maybe you had the wrong number?
JACEY
Are you mad at me?
ELEANOR
No.
Are you mad at me?
JACEY
No.
Who said I was?
ELEANOR
I did.
JACEY
I just wanted to talk to you last
night.
ELEANOR
We can talk tonight at the party.
JACEY
I wasn't invited.
ELEANOR
Yes, you were.
JACEY
No, I wasn't.
ELEANOR
Well, now you are. But if you're
mad at me you don't have to come.
She gives him a sultry smile, turns and glides into a
classroom as the BELL RINGS. The corridor is quickly
vacated by all but Jacey -- he savors the aftertaste of
Eleanor's smile.

Doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror (wearing a
coat and tie) still singing "Heartbreak Hotel" while he
carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide-nib pen
and a bottle of India ink. Jacey's reflection appears in
the mirror behind Doug -- he's wearing a coat and tie too.
Jacey does a pained take on Doug's handiwork:
JACEY
Oh, Christ!

HELEN HOLT is seated at the dining table. She was
grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when
Jacey and Doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the
matter at hand. She is an attractive but unostentatious
woman without interest in appearing to be anything other
than what she is: a forty-one-year-old widow raising two
teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (She teaches
second grade at Haley Elementary School.)
JACEY
He has to wash it off, Mother.
You cannot let him go to the party
unless he washes it off.
DOUG
It'll look worse if I wash it.
It's India ink, it'll turn gray,
it'll look like dirt.
JACEY
He looks like such a clown and he
doesn't even know it! He doesn't
get how things work in this town.
I thought you weren't even going
to the party?
DOUG
Changed my mind.
HELEN
Doug, you do understand that you
may be the only person at this
party with artificial sideburns?
DOUG
Yeah.
HELEN
You do understand that your
sideburns don't look real?
Doug was hoping they didn't look that phony, but he
conceals his disappointment and nods:

DOUG

shrugs)
Yeah.
She looks hard at Doug for a beat, then turns to Jacey.
HELEN
Well, darling, it seems he does
understand. Why don't you just go
on to the party and ignore Doug.
Just have a good time and pretend
you don't even...
Jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front
door before his mother can finish her sermon.

Doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering -- a
tuxedoed ten-piece band plays on the bandstand.
Despite his mother's advice, a nauseated grimace falls
over Jacey's face when he sees that his younger brother
has arrived. He is dancing with Eleanor.

They dance past a group of young men on the sidelines
(Jacey's senior classmates), they are all edgy with envy,
waiting like predators for their chance to dance with
Eleanor.
ELEANOR
I'm going out to the lake
tomorrow. Sandy wants to show-off
her dad's new boat. Why don't you
come?
JACEY
I have to work.
ELEANOR
Well, I guess you'll just have to
write me a letter.
JACEY
What do you mean?
ELEANOR
You said you wanted to talk to me
in private.
JACEY
I meant... just... we never get a
chance to be together, alone, you
know?
STEVE (one of the envious classmates) makes his move and
cuts in on Jacey and dances away with Eleanor. Jacey
handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being
separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as
he observes Eleanor flirting with her new dance partner.

-- sampling the hors d'oeuvres. He places the ones he
doesn't like back onto the platter. PAMELA ABBOTT steps
over to Doug. She is his age (fifteen), the youngest of
the Abbott girls, and the least stuck-up.
PAMELA
Hi.

DOUG
Hi.
She points at Doug's chest.

Doug and Pam smoke their cigarettes in the back yard.
The tent can be seen in the b.g. The band is playing
"MONA LISA."
DOUG
So, is this Peter guy Alice is
gonna marry rich?
PAMELA
Of course. He's one of the Atlas
Steel Vanlaninghams. Pittsburgh.
He's a bully.
DOUG
So how come Alice's marrying him?
PAMELA
Because my parents want her to and
Alice is afraid of my parents.
It's practically an arranged
marriage. They think Alice has
peanut shells for brains or
something, so they sort of
suggested that maybe it was time
to tie the old knot and they sort
of suggested that Peter was the
one to do it with.
DOUG
Jeez, no one can be that much of a
pushover.

I? You got me? The little
brother, I guess.

The band improvises a FANFARE as Lloyd Abbott and his
wife, JOAN ABBOTT, step up onto the bandstand. Joan has
the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her
smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). She has a
tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and
sleep a bit too little.
LLOYD
Ladies and Gentlemen -- I'd like
to propose a toast in honor of our
cause for celebration tonight --
the engagement of our daughter,
Alice, to Mister Peter
Vanlaningham.
He gestures to ALICE ABBOTT and her fiance PETER
VANLANINGHAM. Alice is nineteen, the eldest and the
prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three
sisters. Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh
family. He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the
applause and AD-LIBBED toasts.
The band strikes up "I Got the World on a String" and
Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to
Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto
the dance floor.

The abandoned boathouse is a dilapidated structure
situated on an isolated shore of the large lake. Doug
strikes a wooden match, shepherds the flame, leans over,
holds the match to his ass and lights a fart. The
amorphous blue flame flares and almost instantly
disappears as the gas is consumed. VICTOR, Doug's
partner in crime and best friend, is impressed. (Victor
is fifteen, too.)
VICTOR
Jeez Louise!
How'd you do that?
DOUG
Intestinal gas -- produced by
bacterial metabolism of food
residues in the colon. A mixture
of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon
dioxide, and methane. That's the
secret ingredient.
VICTOR
What's so secret about it?
DOUG
Not everyone can produce methane.
It's genetic, that means it's
inherited. There's a lot of
methane in my family.

Doug washes his hands. Jacey climbs out of the tub and
fetches a towel. And Doug reacts to...

Jacey's back and buttocks are severely bruised. Jacey

lets another attendant wait on them. He retreats into
the garage and resumes mopping the floor.
ELEANOR (O.S.)
Hi.
Jacey finds Eleanor standing in the garage doorway.
ELEANOR
Congratulations.
JACEY
For what?
ELEANOR
I heard you got accepted to Penn.
JACEY
Oh.
Yeah.
Thanks.
ELEANOR

never think about him. I just do
things. And let other people
figure them out. That's what
parents are for. They're real
good at doing all the thinking.
Why should I?

Alice is going to have a baby.
She and Kilroy didn't waste any
time. He's already talking about
having another, and Alice is up-
chucking every hour on the hour.
She's got morning-noon-and-night
sickness. I've got the feeling
she'll be barefoot and puking for
years to come. Wallpaper patterns
-- that's all she talks about.
She and my mother spend hours
looking at wallpaper pattern
books. That's another thing I
never think about... wallpaper.
(another beat)
Well, I think this is called the
silent treatment. I get enough of
that from my father, I don't need
it from you. Good luck at Penn.
She starts to walk away, but Jacey pulls her back and
kisses her fiercely -- Eleanor responds with equal heat.
They don't see Pamela enter the garage. Pam studies them
for an imperturbable beat, then:
PAMELA
Come on, Eleanor -- Dad's waiting.

The decor is mock-Colonial. Victor and Doug (in their

Doug enters with the bowl and ice cream scoop in hand.
He lifts the lid of the freezer, reaches for a carton of
ice cream and something startles him. He cocks his head
to listen and slowly lowers the freezer lid.
He peers into the silvery, dim light and sees Jacey and
Eleanor naked on an old daybed near the coal bin in the
back of the garage. She is on top of Jacey, riding him
rhythmically. Eleanor is facing Doug. She reacts without
alarm or shame when she notices Doug staring at her. She
coolly returns his stare. Doug tries, but he's unable to
avert his eyes.

Doug steals lustful looks at Eleanor from behind his
book. She is seated across the table from him. The
library is filled with students poring over their
assignments. Eleanor is seemingly oblivious to Doug's
probing eyes.
Doug allows his pencil to roll off the edge of the table.
He ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his
ruse is revealed as he stares up Eleanor's skirt at the
soft triangle that her white panties cover between her
parted legs. Eleanor's hand lowers a piece of notebook
paper beneath the table, on it she has written: "Hi
Doug!"
Doug starts with panic, rears back, cracks his head on
the bottom of the table, and then, as his head rebounds
from the blow, he accidentally impales himself in his
chin with the sharp pencil. Doug scrambles up from under
the table with the pencil dangling from his chin,
knocking over his chair in the process. The tranquility
of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted
reactions of the students. Eleanor is momentarily
concerned about his welfare, but she cannot help but
laugh, too.

I don't know much, but I know
that. So like which is it?
PAMELA
Both.
Doug exhales with bewilderment, stubs out his cigarette,
then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela. She holds
perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers
and kisses her. Then he concludes the kiss to check her
reaction; she timidly smiles. He kisses her again with
greater fervor. Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and
massages her breast. Pamela struggles to suppress her
surprise, which he mistakes as a sign of her approval.
Emboldened by her lack of resistance, he slips his hand
under her bra. Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the
sensation, then alarmed by the pace of their passion.
PAMELA
Doug...
Doug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a
framed photograph of Eleanor amongst an assortment of
family photos on the long table behind the sofa. It is
Eleanor that he is thinking of -- in his mind's eye it is
Eleanor's breast that he is fondling. Pamela pulls her
lips from his:

slips it under her skirt. Pam lurches
back into the
sofa:

He tries to kiss her again but she twists her head away.
PAMELA

She shoves him away and jumps off the sofa. Doug looks

gathering, he's pained to discover how easy it is to see
things the way Jacey does: Lloyd holding court with a
group of men in tuxedos... Joan Abbott propelling a
reluctant Alice towards a group of guests Alice's age
(Alice and Peter have separated)... and, finally, Pamela
dancing with a handsome young man (TED). She is the
belle of the ball, radiant and suddenly mature in her
beautiful gown. She smiles as she sees Doug, excuses
herself, and comes over to him.

What am I supposed to be so sorry
about?
PAMELA
Oh, you're not sorry?
DOUG
All right, yeah, I'm sorry.
PAMELA
Sorry about what?

DOUG
You always do this to me.
PAMELA
You said you weren't sorry and now
you say you are. So maybe I'm not
sure what you're sorry about?
DOUG
I'm sorry for what I'm supposed to
be sorry about. Okay?
PAMELA
You're sorry for feeling me up?
DOUG
(embarrassed)
Oh, shit, come on, Pam. Dammit.
For crying out loud. Forget it.
PAMELA
I accept your apology.
Let's
dance.
Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He
feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and
they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles:
PAMELA
Hi.
DOUG
Hi.
Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were
children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for
her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble
of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as
Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval
is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor
to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott.
Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses
the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the
cause.
PAMELA
Is Jacey home for the summer or is
he just here for a visit?
The mention of his brother's name at this exact moment
sends a chill down Doug's spine.

DOUG
Home for the summer.
(slight beat)
It's cheaper if he stays here for
the summer. He can save more
money for school, 'cause he
doesn't have to pay rent. Money's
tight, you know, we're sort of
poor.
PAMELA
You're not poor, are you?
DOUG
Hell -- you kidding? Even with
Jacey working summers, my mom had
to borrow against the house so he
could go to Penn. I don't know
where the money'll come from for
me to go to college.
Doug sees Joan Abbott prompting Ted to cut in on his
dance with Pamela. Doug's bitterness swells.
DOUG
I hear Alice and Peter are getting
a divorce.
PAMELA
They're just separated.
DOUG
What's the difference?
PAMELA
I don't know, you'll have to ask
them.
DOUG
So, where's Eleanor tonight?
PAMELA
Eleanor's... just not here.
DOUG
Is she pregnant?
PAMELA
No!

Ted steps over and taps Doug on the shoulder.
DOUG
Fuck off.
Ted is taken aback.
Pamela's eyes fill with tears.
PAMELA
Why do you hate me so much?
TED
Excuse me, asshole, but...
Doug spins and slugs Ted in the jaw -- sending him
reeling into the other dancers. Everyone pulls away from
Doug and Pam. Doug massages his fist and looks
helplessly at Pamela:
DOUG
I don't hate you.

Nope.

Helen looks over the merchandise. Doug absent-mindedly
trails after his mother as he studies a large brochure
about the University of Pennsylvania.
DOUG
What's 'scenic design'?

In what context?
DOUG
What a minute -- it's theatre.

Doug looks up from the brochure and comes face-to-face
with a mannequin wearing a bra, girdle, and stockings.
He almost flinches with surprise and blushes profusely:
DOUG
I'll wait for you outside, Ma.

Doug and Helen share a bag of popcorn as they wait for

Jacey sits at the counter at the rear of the busy diner
sipping an iced tea. He sees Alice Abbott enter -- she
pulls a dollar bill out of her purse as she approaches
the cash register near the front door. She calls out
to a waitress who is fetching an order from the grill.
ALICE
Excuse me -- could I get change
for a dollar?
The waitress is too distracted to take notice of Alice
and Alice herself doesn't notice Jacey as he steps up
behind her.
JACEY
Can I help you?
ALICE
Yes, I need change for...

Oh... you don't work here, do you?

Oh, thanks.
JACEY

ALICE
I don't care if my mother sees

JACEY

Then you won't care if I ask her
if she'd like to join us for an

ALICE
No!
Wait.
Jacey turns to her.
ALICE
I don't know if I can.
I'll try.
It just depends.
Alice goes out the door -- as she passes by Jacey he
says:
JACEY

River Point.
Around
noon.
Jacey watches through the window as Alice returns to
the Town & Country station wagon and puts a few coins
into the meter. Joan waits impatiently beside the car
with Susan in hand. As the Abbott women walk down the
sidewalk (away from the diner), Alice glances back and

Jacey lounges on top of a blanket beside a cooler.

carries a picnic basket. Other than a few children
skipping rock into the river they are alone.
JACEY
We are everyone.
ALICE
But you said...
JACEY

No, I didn't. I just said a

Jacey and Alice wander along a path on the riverbank.
ALICE
I knew he would hit me. Peter's a
real hot-head. I knew if he hit
me hard enough, hurt me enough,
that even my father wouldn't stand
for it. Then one night I put too
much soap in the washing machine
and it overflowed. That did it.
He punched me. Broke my front
tooth.
JACEY
Bastard.

Jacey holds open the driver's door as Alice climbs in

wagon). He closes the door.
JACEY
Which tooth was it?
She points to a front tooth.
He leans over to look at
it.
ALICE
This one. I had it capped.
You
can't really tell, can you?
JACEY
No.
It's a beautiful mouth.
ALICE
Are you going to kiss me?
JACEY
I don't want to scare you.
ALICE
I can't see you again, Jacey.

There are ways.

Oh, God... why you? Why am I
telling all these things to you?

Better head home. Shouldn't be
gone too long.
Alice drives away.
Jacey smiles -- he's won.

The movie has already begun. Alice enters the sparsely
peopled theatre and pauses to allow her eyes to adjust to
the darkness. A hand reaches out and takes her hand --
it is Jacey. He's seated beside the door. He rises and
leads her across the row of empty seats to the exit.

Jacey guides Alice to two seats deep in the shadows of
the otherwise unoccupied balcony. They gaze at the
screen for a few moments, then he moves his mouth to her
ear and nibbles on her lobe. She turns her lips to his
and they kiss passionately. Jacey slides his hand under
her skirt. Alice presses herself against his hand and
whispers:

DOUG
Two weeks. She goes up every

Eleanor lives in Chicago.

Yeah. She's going to stewardess

DOUG
What do they teach you at

PAMELA
I don't know.
How to wiggle your

Maybe you should go there instead
of Bryn Mawr?
She pushes harder against his feet and her foot slips off
his and clobbers him in the crotch. He moans and sits
up.
DOUG
Oww!
Damn!
PAMELA
Sorry.

It was an accident. Don't be

They kiss but are almost instantly interrupted by the
SLAM of the SCREEN DOOR. Doug looks up and does a
surprised take as he sees Alice going up the stairs
followed by Jacey.

Jacey was almost two and I was
eight months pregnant with you
and... well, some mornings I'd be
crying before I even woke up.
Then you were born. And Jacey
just got lost in there. I didn't
have anything for him. Mother
took him over. He'd cry or call
for me, and then I'd hear Mother
answer him, and I'd go back to
sleep.
(sighs bitterly)
I should've taken us away from
here, gone somewhere else.
DOUG
Why?
HELEN
After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott
started dropping by on his way
home from work. He felt so bad
about that bet Charlie made with
him at the lake. That foolish,
idiotic bet. Poor Lloyd -- I felt
sorry for him. He'd have a cup of
coffee with Mother and me. If a
doorknob had come off he'd fix it.
He'd carry the garbage cans to the
curb. Someone dies, people try to
be helpful. But he was by here so
often that people started to talk.
It was fairly obvious that he
wanted something more from me than
just a cup of coffee. I suggested
that he didn't need to stop by
here so often, but... then one
afternoon I was at Woolworth's,
having lunch at the counter. All
of sudden Joan Abbott was standing
there -- screaming and yelling at
me to stop sleeping with her
husband, with Lloyd. I was

say that, darling. Besides, Lloyd
was always having affairs. He's

DOUG
Ahhh, Jesus... but why? Why did

Abbott?

Because she's Joan Abbott. If you
cross Joan you don't get invited

have the best parties in town.
The only parties.

The Co-ed is bothered but none-the-less bewitched.
CO-ED
Ahh... you know, I'm engaged.
JACEY
So am I.
CO-ED
(shocked)
You are?
JACEY
I'm engaged in conversation with
you.
Jacey smiles and then kisses her. Doug is spying on them
from the safety of the crowd. Jacey winks at Doug. Doug
shakes his head in wonder.
132
133
Doug is revising a set design -- deeply concentrating on
his task. He's startled by a KNOCK on the door.
MALE STUDENT (O.S.)
Hey, Holt! You got a visitor
downstairs!
134
134
Doug comes down the wide stairs with a puzzled look on
his face. He stops at the front desk and the student
clerk points to another part of the lobby. Doug walks
across the cavernous lobby and finds Pamela Abbott
slumped in a chair.
DOUG
Did you miss the bus?
Pam laughs and Doug suddenly realizes:
DOUG
Damn, you're drunk. Awww, man...
I better get you out of here before
the Puritans tar-and-feather you.
Can you walk?
Pam awkwardly rises and Doug guides her to the door.
DOUG
Listen to me -- go out the front
door, turn right, go around to the
side of the building and wait for
me by the fire escape. Okay?
Just wait.
135
136
Pam sits on the bed as Doug pulls her stained turtleneck
sweater off over her head (she's wearing a bra).
DOUG
What were you drinking, Sterno?
PAMELA
I'm cold...
DOUG
Hold on, we got to get your pants
too. Can you stand up.
(as she collapses on
the bed))
No, you can't stand up. All
right.
He undoes the waist of her pants and tugs on her pant
legs, but her panties start to slide off along with her
pants.
DOUG
Nope, nope, let's keep the panties
on, okay? Pam? Can you hold on
to your underpants?
(she's out)
I'll hold on to your underpants.
He holds her panties in place while he struggles to get
her pants over her hips.
137

Doug rinses out Pam's clothes in a sink.
138
138
Pam's wet clothes have been draped over the radiator.
Pam is passed out, tucked in under the covers. Doug sits
on the edge of the bed gently cleaning her face with a
damp washcloth.

139
139
Doug
stirs from his sleeping spot on the floor (he slept
with
his clothes on). He notices that Pam's clothes have
been
removed from the radiator. He sits up and finds
that
the bed is empty. She's gone.
140
141
Doug lounges on his bed reading a textbook. It is
raining outside. He is startled by a TAPPING on the
windowpane. Pamela is outside on the fire escape. He
ignores her.

PAMELA
Doug! Open the window!
Come on,
I'm freezing. Doug...!
He gets out of bed, unlatches the window, then returns to
the bed and his book. Pamela opens the window (with
difficulty) and climbs in. She drapes her wet coat over
the radiator and sits in the desk chair.
DOUG
If you feel like you're gonna puke
use the wastebasket there.
PAMELA
I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I was
embarrassed. I didn't know where
I was when I woke up. I felt like
I was dying, so, I just... I was
going to call you.
Doug doesn't respond -- he turns the page of his book.
PAMELA
I don't know... I was blotto. I
mean, I was so happy to see you.
Then I just got sad. I got sad.
And stupid. It happens, you know?
Doug snaps his book shut.
DOUG
You want to hear something stupid?
PAMELA
What?
DOUG
When I was cleaning you up, wiping
the puke off your face, I suddenly
realized how much I miss you --
how much I love you. How's that
for stupid?
Pam is stung by his flippancy, she begins to cry.
DOUG
What are you crying for?
PAMELA
I love you.
But it's too late.
DOUG
Why?

PAMELA
Everything's too screwed up.
Doug kneels in front of her and anxiously tries to
console her.
DOUG
No, no, it's not too late. It's
perfect timing. We're on our own
now. No Jacey and Eleanor or
Jacey and Alice. That's what
stinks about being the youngest,
we have to sweep up after
everybody else. But now it's just
us. It's our turn.
PAMELA
How can you be in love with me?
DOUG
How can you be in love with me?
PAMELA
'Cause I've always have been.
You... block-head.
He kisses her, then he gazes at her and strokes her hair.
DOUG
Hi.
PAMELA
Hi.
DOUG
You want to see something?
PAMELA
What?
DOUG
Come on.

standing on the bare stage.

Doug leads Pam by the hand down the aisle from the lobby.
PAMELA
What are we doing here?
DOUG
I want to show you something.
He escorts her up a short flight of steps and positions
her center stage near the footlights.
DOUG
Just stand right there.
He takes the work light with him as he walks off stage.
Then with a METALLIC CLANK everything goes dark.
PAMELA
(alarmed)
Doug!
DOUG (O.S.)
It's all right -- don't move!
Stay put.
There's the RUMBLE and SQUEAK of a piece of SCENERY being
rolled onto stage -- then the SWOOSH of a backdrop being
lowered from the fly loft.
DOUG (O.S.)
Almost, almost... hold on.
We hear Doug RUNNING somewhere backstage then a beautiful
sunset slowly illuminates the stage -- creating the
perfect mood for the modestly scaled stylized set that
Doug has put into place: It is the roof of a weathered
farmhouse with a dormer window and a tall brick chimney.
Doug steps on stage, he's a bit winded from his quick-
change routine.
PAMELA
Oh, Doug, it's beautiful.
DOUG
The senior acting class does
scenes from different plays, they
invite everybody, it's a real big
deal. So, there's this
competition among all the theater
design students to do the sets.
And -- anyway -- I'm the one
whose design got picked.

DOUG

Umm... Romeo and Juliet. It's
something different, I think
that's why they picked it.
Everybody else was doing castles
and stuff. Rooftop Romeo and
Juliet by Douglas L. Holt.
PAMELA
You're really good at this.
DOUG
It's like building models when I
was a kid. It's fun. It's...
make-believe.
PAMELA
You know, they tore that old
farmhouse down?
DOUG
Oh, no.
Did they?
PAMELA
Yeah.
DOUG
They always tear down the wrong
stuff.
PAMELA
Oh, Jesus, I missed you -- so
much.
DOUG
Missed you, too.
They kiss -- then Pamela pulls away.
Doug studies her,
then:
DOUG
You have a boyfriend, right?
PAMELA
No.
DOUG
Well, what? You worried what your
old man would think?

DOUG
Why not? I mean... okay. We
don't have to go so fast. Shit,
I'm sorry. I blew it again, huh?
PAMELA
No, I did.
DOUG
How?
Pam climbs down off the stage and starts up the aisle.
PAMELA
I'm on probation. They pulled a
bed-check the night I was here. I
have to be back in the dorm by
ten. Gotta go.
DOUG
What about tomorrow? I could come
up in the afternoon and...
PAMELA
No! It's just too late. It's all
messed up. I can't seem to make
things all right. The more I try
the worse everything gets. I'm

Pam walks up the aisle and disappears through a door to
the lobby.

Pam enters the lobby. A female student CLERK (#1)

Pam ignores the Clerk and the message and goes upstairs.

Jacey sits in his favorite armchair reading the Sunday
newspaper. Doug sits in the middle of the sofa. Jacey
scrutinizes his brooding younger brother.
JACEY
What's wrong with you?
DOUG
Nothing.
A boiling water KETTLE starts to WHISTLE (O.S.) -- Jacey
goes into the kitchen to tend to it. There is a soft
KNOCK on the front door. Doug goes to answer it. He
opens the door and finds Pamela standing there with her
coat in her hand. He is pleasantly surprised; Pam is
distant, slightly off-balance.

Hi.

Sundays.
PAMELA
I forgot.
The breath goes out of Doug as if he'd been struck in the
stomach.
JACEY
Dammit, why didn't you call first?
PAMELA
Didn't have any nickels.
JACEY
Well, I didn't expect to see you
again. You want to fuck? I mean,
that's why you came over, right?
PAMELA
(slight beat)
Sure.
JACEY
Then take off your clothes.
Pamela drops her coat on the floor. She pulls her
sweater off over her head. Doug's anguish is as great
as Pamela's humiliation. He cannot bear any more if
this -- he walks out the door.

I didn't know.
DOUG
You didn't know what?!
JACEY
How you felt about Pam.
DOUG
Fuck you.
JACEY
I'm sorry.
DOUG
Apologize to her, you asshole!
JACEY
I did.
(slight beat)
I ran into her a few weeks ago at
a party. She was drinking and
I... it was easy. She felt guilty
about telling her father about
Alice and me. Actually, I made
her feel guilty, I made her feel
like she had betrayed Alice.
DOUG
She didn't betray Alice! She was
just trying to get rid of you so
Alice wouldn't try to kill herself
again. Jesus Christ, you shit-
head, Alice couldn't marry you!
JACEY
I know.
I mean, I do now.

Just your way of evening the score

Doug spins and delivers a wild, roundhouse punch that
lands brutally on the side of Jacey's face -- the impact
knocks him down onto the steps. Jacey's eyebrow has
split open, he is blinded by blood.
DOUG
I don't know
you! I don't know
who the fuck
you are! You fuck
everything.
You fuck everything
up! Why did
you have to fuck Pam,
too?!
Doug walks away, leaving Jacey sitting on the steps,
clutching a banister for support. He presses his palm to
his eyebrow to squelch the flow of blood.

Doug steps up to the female student CLERK (#2) at the

DOUG
I guess that free-lance drafting
job was too good for him to turn

HELEN
I don't think that's why he didn't
come home. I wrote him a letter,
you know. About Lloyd and me.
Has he mentioned it to you?
DOUG
No.
Doug wants to avoid the topic of Jacey.
He opens the
refrigerator.
DOUG
When did you start drinking beer?
HELEN
Oh... I bought those for you. I
had them in the basement; I kept
forgetting to bring them up.
He does a bemused take on her.
HELEN
Good heavens, I know you drink
beer.
Doug takes out two bottles of beer and opens them.
DOUG
Here.
Have one with me.
HELEN
I bought those for you, honey.

It's beer.
DOUG
Let's drink 'em all.
Helen laughs girlishly.
HELEN
Charlie was always trying to get
me to drink beer.
DOUG
Why do you always call him
Charlie?
HELEN
That was his name.
DOUG
Why don't you ever say 'your
father'?
HELEN
Sometimes I do, don't I? I don't
know. When I think of him, I
think of 'Charlie.'
DOUG
Did you ever... meet anybody else?
HELEN
You mean another man?
DOUG
Yeah.
HELEN
Well, everyone always thinks
things are more possible than they
are. I mean, single men don't
stay in Haley if they have any
starch. The only eligible man
around was Drew Carter, but he

Don't be.
Everyone has sad times.
Doug dissolves into tears. He lowers his head and
shields his eyes with his hand. Helen leans over and
strokes his hair. After a few moments, he rises and
wipes away his tears with a dish towel.
HELEN
I'll tell you a secret. I did
have a friend. A man in Chicago.
I used to see him when I went up
to Chicago to visit Bea during
summer vacations.
DOUG
'Used to see him' -- you don't see
him anymore?
HELEN
No.
DOUG
Did you like him?
HELEN
He was a wonderful man. A little
boring, but really, very
wonderful.
DOUG
How long did this go on?
HELEN
About eight years or so, it was
when you boys were still at home.

kinds of love, darling. Some
people you love no matter what.
Other people you love if the

The second-grade students are in the midst of an art

of dried beans to colored paper -- but the beans are
being thrown about the room and other beans have been
spilled on the floor. Helen wearily attempts to rein in
the unruly children:
HELEN
Too much noise, please. Let's
finish up. Keep the glue on the
paper. Sam, Lillian, Jack -- in

ELEANOR
Hi, Doug!
Doug almost doesn't recognize her. She is twenty years
old now and very grown-up, very stylish in her stewardess

Used cars were the only kind of
cars around. The war was on --
everything was mobilized. They
stopped making new cars, they were
making tanks and bombers in
Detroit. And even Midwest Steel
wasn't making desks, they were
making ammo boxes and mortar
shells.
JACEY
How did you get to be such an
expert on World War Two?
DOUG
U.S. History -- high school. I
should be an expert, I had to take
the damn class twice. I guess Dad
needed a car and he figured who-

file drawer?

Despite it being a birthday party for a three-year-old,
this is very much a grown-up affair. The band is
playing, the adults are dancing, Joan Abbott is flitting
from guest-to-guest, Alice is dutifully silent while
Peter dominates the talk at their table, Lloyd is with
his cronies. Doug enters the tent -- one-by-one the
guests take notice of him as he works his way across the
tent -- and all are very aware of his uninvited presence
by the time he reaches Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd scrutinizes
Doug, then:

You didn't know your mother at all
if you think someone like me
would've ever stood a chance with
someone like her. That just goes
to show you how stupid this town
is -- that they'd believe she
slept with me. That'd make
Charlie laugh. Your old man was
my best friend. He used to call
me 'Egg-head' -- hell, everybody
did. And back then everybody knew
that Egg-head Abbott didn't stand
a snowball's chance in hell with
Helen Riley. Of course, that was
all before I became Lloyd Abbott
-- Mr. Abbott. That was back when
I still had chicken shit on my
shoes and twelve cents in my
pocket. Charlie Holt was the only
one good enough for Helen. I used
to spy on 'em -- yup, I did.

Used to watch them sit on the
front porch of her house -- your
house -- and watch 'em talk.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
And talk. I never knew what to
say to a girl. Never could just
talk. Could dance, could listen
to the radio. But I couldn't
talk... except with your mother,
except with Helen. I talked more
to her after your dad died than
I'd ever talked to any woman
before then -- or since then.
Jesus, I talked. Just like this.
Just like right now. Just pouring
out. Helen would listen and
whatever I said, she'd never make
me feel bad or ignorant or guilty.
I mean... for Christ's sake, she
never blamed me for what happened
at the lake, for letting Charlie
drive out on that ice. She never
did anything but try to make me
hurt less and I...
Lloyd is startled by Joan as she opens the door.
JOAN
Lloyd...?
LLOYD
Get out of here!
JOAN
It's time for Susie's birthday
cake.
LLOYD
(exploding)
Goddammit, Joan, go way! Get the
hell out of here! Leave me alone!
He hurls his GLASS at her and it SHATTERS on the door
jamb. Joan recoils in dumb-founded shock and backs out
of the doorway. Lloyd fumes over and slams the door shut
in her face. He leans against the door and catches his
breath.
LLOYD
I wanted sons -- isn't that funny?
I wanted sons and I got three
daughters. I wanted a woman I
could talk to and I got a woman
whose ears are stuffed full of
money and Percodan. But I got the
chicken shit off my shoes.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
My shoes are clean.
(slight beat)
I know that's what Jacey thinks.
I could always tell by the way he
looked at me -- even when he was a
little boy -- like I owed him
something. But, goddammit, he's
wrong. That bet was your father's
idea and I never meant your mother
any harm. I would've done
anything for her -- anything. I
loved her. But the only thing she
ever wanted from me was just for
me to leave her alone.
He pours himself a fresh drink, then turns to Doug:
LLOYD
So, what do you want?
DOUG
I want to find Pam -- and you're
going to tell me where she is.
