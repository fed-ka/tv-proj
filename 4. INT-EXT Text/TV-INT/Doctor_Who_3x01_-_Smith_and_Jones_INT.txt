                    It's a nightmare, cos Dad won't
                    listen, and I'm telling you, Mum
                    is going mental, swear to God,
                    Martha, this is epic, you've got
                    to get in there and stop him -

                    Well how do I do that?

                    Just tell Dad he can't bring her -

                    off, tell 'em I don't even want a
                    party, I didn't even ask for one,
                    they can give me the money instead -

                    Yeah, but why do I have to tell

                    I don't mind your father making a
                    fool of himself in private, but
                    this is Leo's twenty-first,
                      everyone's going to be there, and
                    the entire family is going to look
                      ridiculous -

      CLIVE JONES, 49, getting into nifty second-hand sportscar -
      it's way too young for him, very mid-life-crisis.

                                      CLIVE
                    Martha, now tell your mother, Leo
                    is my son, and I'm paying for half
                    that party, I'm entitled to bring
                    who I like -

                                      MARTHA
                    I know, but think what it's going
                    to look like for Mum, if you're
                    standing there with Annalise -

                    What's wrong with Annalise?

      ANNALISE jumps into the car.  All 21 years of her.  Dressed
      like a Big Brother eviction night.

                    Now take me shopping, big boy.

      Clive & Annalise, big smoochy kiss -

      Martha revolted!  Oh!  As she holds the phone away -

      A MAN steps out in front of her, making her stop -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Like so!

      And with a big smile, he takes his tie off.  Holds it up.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    D'you see? 

      And with that, he runs off. 

      Martha shrugs it off.  Nutter.  She walks on.  Her phone
      rings.  Defiant, she bleeps it off.  Not worn down by any
      of this; she keeps her humour, head held high.

      FX: REVERSE, Martha walking away from CAMERA, but in the
      distance, storm clouds gathering.  Lightning, far off.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Small space, grey metal lockers.  MARTHA shucking on her
      white coat; she's a medical student.  She closes her locker -

      FX: small zig zag of static electricity, from the locker
      to her hand.

      She just gives an 'ow', but it's nothing, she heads out.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      FLORENCE FINNEGAN in bed, 70, frail, a bit genteel.

                                      FLORENCE
                    I was all right till this morning,
                    then...  Oh, I don't know, I woke
                    up, I was all dizzy again, it was
                    worse than when I came in.

      REVEAL her bed surrounded by MEDICAL STUDENTS, including
      MARTHA, and MORGENSTERN, specky lad, and JULIA SWALES, 23,
      Martha's mate.  All led by MR STOKER, 55, suit, puffed up.

                                    MR STOKER
                    Pulse is slightly thready, let's
                    see what Britain's finest might
                    suggest, any ideas?  Morgenstern?

                                      MORGENSTERN
                    Uh, dizziness could be a sign of
                    early onset diabetes -

                                    MR STOKER
                    Hardly early onset, if you'll
                    forgive me, Miss Finnegan, any
                    more ideas, Swales?

                                      JULIA
                    Um.  Could recommend a CT scan -

                                    MR STOKER
                    - and spend all our money, Jones?

                                      MARTHA
                    Um.  We could take bloods and check
                    for Meniere's disease -

                                    MR STOKER
                    Or we could simply ask the patient,
                    what did you have for dinner last
                    night?

                                      FLORENCE
                    I had the salad.

                                    MR STOKER
                    And the night before?

                                      FLORENCE
                    Salad again. 

                                    MR STOKER
                    And salad every night for the past
                    week, contrary to my instructions. 
                    Salt deficiency, that's all. 
                    Simple, honest salt.

                                                                      JUMP CUT TO:


      (NB, the WARDS & CORRIDORS are on Floor 6.)  MR STOKER
      striding along, the MEDICAL STUDENTS following like ducks,
      including MARTHA, JULIA & MORGENSTERN.

                                    MR STOKER
                      Hippocrates himself expounded on
                    the virtues of salt.  Recommended
                    the inhalation of steam from sea-
                    water.  Though no doubt, if he'd
                    been afflicted with my students,
                    his oaths might have been rather
                    more colourful.

      Martha glances as they pass the MOTORCYCLE COURIER - stay
      on him as they sweep into the next ward -

      The courier turns to face the lifts.  The lift door opens -

      Standing inside: A SECOND MOTORCYCLE COURIER.  Identical. 
      He joins the first, both walk off in unison.  Like soldiers.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      MR STOKER leads the MEDICAL STUDENTS - MARTHA, MORGENSTERN,
      JULIA & others - to another bed, a NURSE joining them.

                                    MR STOKER
                    Now then, Mr Smith, a very good
                    morning, and how are you today?

      REVEAL, in bed: the MAN from sc.5, in pyjamas.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Oh, not so bad.  Still a bit,
                    y'know.  Blehhh.

                                    MR STOKER
                    John Smith, admitted yesterday

      Martha moving forward, but puzzled:

                                      MARTHA
                    Well it wasn't very clever running
                    round outside, was it?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Sorry?

                                      MARTHA
                    On Chancellor Street, this morning. 
                    You came up to me and took your
                    tie off.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Really?  What did I do that for?

                                      MARTHA
                    I don't know, you just did.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Not me, I was here, I was in bed,
                    you can ask the nurses.

                                      MARTHA
                    That's weird, cos it looked like
                    you, have you got a brother?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Nope, not any more.  Just me!

                                    MR STOKER
                    As time passes and I grow ever
                    more infirm and weary, Miss Jones..?

                                      MARTHA
                    Sorry, um.  Right...

      She puts the stethoscope to left of his chest.  Ba-boom-ba-
      boom-ba-boom.  But under that, an echo..?  She looks up at
      the Doctor, puzzled.  He just gives a big smile.

      She moves the stethoscope over, to his right side.  A second
      heartbeat, ba-boom-ba-boom-ba-boom.

      Martha looks up, astonished, right into the Doctor's eyes.

      And he gives her the smallest wink.

                                    MR STOKER
                    I weep for future generations, but
                    are you having trouble locating
                    the heart, Miss Jones?

      Moment broken - Martha steps back, covers it:

                                      MARTHA
                    Um, I don't know.  Stomach cramps..?

                    That's a symptom, not a diagnosis,
                    and you rather failed basic
                      techniques by not consulting first
                    with the patient's chart -

      He picks up the Doctor's clipboard, on the end of the bed -

      FX: blue zig-zag of electricity between Stoker's hand and
      the metal clip of the clipboard - he drops it -

                                      MARTHA
                    That happened to me this morning.

                                      MORGENSTERN
                    I had the same off the door handle.

                    And me, in the lift.

                                    MR STOKER
                    Only to be expected, there's a
                      thunderstorm moving in, lightning
                    being a form of static electricity,
                    as first proven by, anyone?   

                                    THE DOCTOR

                                    MR STOKER
                    Correct.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    My mate Ben!  That was a day and a

                                    MR STOKER
                    Moving on.
                          (mutters to nurse)
                    I think, a visit from Psychiatric.

      The students leave, Martha looking back for a second,
      intrigued.  The Doctor just beams at her.

                                                                            CUT TO: 3   -  Episode One   -   Yellow Revisions   -   18/08/06  - Page 8.Doctor Who




      At the windows: rain coming down outside, hard.

      It's one of those narrow corridor-like staff kitchens,
      just off the general wards; functional, cupboards, kettle. 
      MARTHA on her mobile, JULIA beside her, making coffee.

                                      MARTHA
                    No, listen, I've worked out a plan,
                    we tell Annalise that the buffet
                    tonight is 100% carbohydrate, and
                    she won't turn up!

      PANIC!  MARTHA running down the corridor - JULIA, already
      crying, but following - and all around -

      PATIENTS, VISITORS, STAFF, running left and right, SNATCHED
      GLIMPSES OF: a WOMAN sitting on the floor, rocking to and
      fro - two WOMEN hugging, crying, desperate - a MAN in
      hospital gowns just yelling 'Help me!' like a maniac -

      Martha runs to another window -

      FX: same view, the Moon, the Earth in the sky.

      Martha runs on, Julia following - pushing past FLORENCE,
      bewildered, in her nightie but clutching a patent black
      handbag, still genteel in the madness -

                                      FLORENCE
                    - have you seen Mr Stoker - ?

      MARTHA runs in - heading for the window -

      - there's one OLD MAN cowering in bed, another two MEN on
      the floor, crying - and THE DOCTOR at his bed; as Martha
      runs past, he draws the curtains round, out of sight -

                                      MARTHA
                    All right, now everyone, back to
                    bed, we've got an emergency, but
                    we'll sort it out, don't worry -

      And Martha & Julia reach the window.

      FX: same view, Moon, Earth.  Quiet again:

                                      MARTHA (CONT'D)
                    It's real, it's really... real. 
                    Hold on -

      She goes to open the window -

                                      JULIA
                    Don't!  We'll lose all the air!

                                      MARTHA
                    They're not exactly airtight.  If
                    the air was gonna get sucked out,
                    it would've happened straight away,
                    but it didn't, so how come?

      And the screens are pulled back from around the bed -

      The Doctor, fully dressed! 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Very good point!  Brilliant, in
                    fact, what was your name?

                                      MARTHA
                    Martha.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And it was Jones, wasn't it?  Right
                    then, Martha Jones, question is:
                    how are we still breathing?

                    But obviously, we are, so don't
                    waste my time - Martha, what have
                    we got, is there a balcony on this
                    floor, or a verandah, or..?

                                      MARTHA
                    By the patients' lounge, yeah.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Fancy going out?

                                      MARTHA
                    Okay.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    We might die.

                                      MARTHA
                    We might not.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Good!  Come on -
                          (at Julia)
                    Not her, she'd hold us up.

      And he's running out - Martha following -

      - but she looks back at Julia, who's pathetic, weeping. 
      Martha makes her choice.  She goes with the Doctor.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CAMERA ext, looking in.  MR STOKER at the glass, so scared. 
      But he's got a little pair of binoculars (for the golf
      course).  With a shaking hand, he lifts them up.

      FX: STOKER's POV, though still distant: yomping across the
      Moon, a long line of JUDOON.  Burly, tough figures in black,
      heads in black helmets.  And armed.  Like stormtroopers.

                                      FLORENCE
                    Mr Stoker..?

      FLORENCE is in the doorway, frail, clutching her handbag.

                                      FLORENCE (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry.  I didn't know who else
                    to ask.  But can you help me..?

      Stoker's wild and bitter, a mad little laugh.

                                    MR STOKER
                    Oh!  I think we've gone beyond
                    aspirin, Miss what-was-it?

                    Names!  What does it matter?  What
                    are names now, when something
                      unnameable is marching towards us? 
                    Across the Moon!  Two more years,
                      I thought, just two more years,
                    then retire to Florida.  But there's
                    Florida, in the sky, I can see it!
                          (suddenly quiet)
                    My daughter.  She's still in
                      university.  I'm never going to
                    see her again.

                                      FLORENCE
                    But I need help, Mr Stoker.

                                    MR STOKER
                    I can't do anything!

                                      FLORENCE
                    Oh, I think you can.

      And the TWO MOTORCYCLE COURIERS enter, stand beside her. 
      Florence a lot colder, now, though still polite.

                                      FLORENCE (CONT'D)
                    You see, there are great tests to
                    come.  And terrible deeds.  Some
                    of them my own.  But if I'm to
                    survive this, then I need you.

                                    MR STOKER
                    I'm sorry, but... what do you two
                    want?  It's a bit late to sign for
                      something!

                                      FLORENCE
                    These are my lovely boys.  I prefer
                    not to get my hands dirty.

                                    MR STOKER
                    What are you talking about?

                                      FLORENCE
                    Blood.  Specifically, yours.

      She snaps her fingers -

      The two Couriers stride forward - grab Mr Stoker -

                                    MR STOKER
                    - what are you doing?  What the
                    hell - ?  Get off me, let go of me -

      But each is holding one of his arms, facing Florence. 
      Stoker trapped, terrified, as Florence walks closer, musing:

                    You see, I was only salt deficient
                    because I'm so very good at
                    absorbing it.  And now I need a
                    some fire in my veins.  Who better
                    than a consultant, with blood full
                    of salty fat and vintage wine and
                    all those Michelin-star sauces?

                                    MR STOKER
                    Who are you..?

                    Oh, I'm a survivor, Mr Stoker.  At
                    any cost.  And look!
                          (from her handbag:)
                    I even brought a straw.

      And she holds up a stripy, bendy straw.  A terrible smile.

      CU Mr Stoker, as he screams his last.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Plain reception area, spacious; chairs, Information Desk,
      a little shop.  Mezzanine level above.  PEOPLE gathered in
      small, terrified groups, some just huddled on the floor. 
      The level of hysteria is rising, all staring at the doors.

      FX: looking out of the doors, PITCH BLACK beyond, with
      JUDOON marching towards them -

      FX: vwop!, the invisible membrane is just outside the doors,
      the blue ripple around each JUDOON as they yomp forwards -

      - and enter reception.  People shrinking back, a WOMAN
      screaming now, others crying, whimpering, a MAN begging,
      don't kill me, don't kill me.  Only MORGENSTERN is wide-
      eyed, fascinated - scared, but loving it.

      FX: duplicate number of Judoon, as - 

      They stamp in, spread out, taking control of the foyer,
      the JUDOON CAPTAIN standing centre -  

      THE JUDOON are big & brutish, stocky, thickset, in uniforms
      of studded black leather panels; the lower half is a leather
      skirt, like Roman centurions; hefty boots below.  Heads
      are covered with shiny black helmets, in the strangest
      shape, like the thick head juts forward, on to the chest,
      then twists up at the end.  It's hard to work out, until
      the JUDOON CAPTAIN twists a clasp at his neck - the hiss
      of depressurisation - and lifts off his helmet.

      The head of a RHINO.  A humanoid Rhino.  Grey leathery
      skin.  Snout curving down, then up into a horn; helmets
      modelled around this (all other Judoon keep helmets on).

                    Blo!  Co!  Sho!  Ro!

      On command, all the Judoon raise weapons -

      Morgenstern steps forward, brave.

                                      MORGENSTERN
                    Um.  We are citizens of Planet
                    Earth.  We welcome you in peace -

      The Captain strides forward, slams him up against the wall. 
      Then the Captain holds up a mini-torch device.  He shines
      white PRAC LIGHT down Morgenstern's throat -

                                      MORGENSTERN (CONT'D)
                    No, don't hurt me, I was trying to
                    help, I'm sorry, don't hurt me,
                    please don't hurt me -

      The Captain holds up the device, presses a button. 
      Morgenstern's voice plays back, high-pitched, fast,
              'Nodonthurtmeiwastryingtohelpimsorryplease - '

      The Captain jams the device into a nozzle on his own chest. 
      A whirr, he shudders, then, a deep guttural voice:

                                      JUDOON CAPTAIN
                    Language assimilated.  Designation:
                      EarthEnglish.  You will be
                      catalogued.

      The Captain holds up a second device, another small hand-
      held tube, shines it on Morgenstern's forehead.  PRAC BLUE
      LIGHT - wip-wip-wip! noise -

                                      JUDOON CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                    Category: Human.

      And he takes hold of Morgenstern's hand, flips the device
      round - the other end is a thick magic marker, and he draws
      an X on the back of Morgenstern's hand.  To his troops:

                                      JUDOON CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                    Catalogue all suspects!

      Judoon stride forward - people shrink back.  But all the
      Judoon have one of the second devices, use it to shine
      blue light on someone's forehead, wip-wip-wip! - then each
      JUDOON says 'Human,' draws an X on the back of the hand.

      All around the room, a MAN, a WOMAN, OLD MAN, KID, MAN #2,
      scared, but cooperating, as they're branded like cattle.

                    Galactic Law, they've got no
                      jurisdiction over the Earth.  So
                    they isolated us.  That rain, and
                    the lightning, that was them, using
                    an H2O Scoop.   

                                      MARTHA
                    What are you on about, Galactic
                    Law?  Where d'you get that from?

      But he's shifting round, to get a better viewpoint, and
      still stay out of sight; she follows.

                                      MARTHA (CONT'D)
                    If they're police, are we under
                    arrest?  Are we trespassing on the
                    Moon or something?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, but I like that!  Good thinking. 
                    Wish it was that simple.  If they're
                    making a catalogue, that means
                    they're after something non-Human. 
                    Which is very bad news for me.

                                      MARTHA
                    Why?

      He just looks at her.

                                      MARTHA (CONT'D)
                    ...no.  You're kidding me.
                          (pause)
                    Don't be ridiculous.
                          (pause)
                    Stop looking at me like that!

      He's heading back to the stairs.  And - damn him! - she
      follows.

      CUT TO FLOOR LEVEL, the CAPTAIN calls out:

                                      JUDOON CAPTAIN
                    Troop Five, Floor One!  Troop Six,

      JUDOON yomp up the stairs - big heavy boots stomping,
      they're brutish thugs, unstoppable -

      THE DOCTOR & MARTHA run out of the stairwell - a sign saying
      FLOOR 6 - and down the corridor -

      PEOPLE have sunk into themselves in misery, huddled on the
      floor.  The Doctor & Martha hop round & over them, fast -

                                                                            CUT TO:


      FLOOR 1 SIGN.  The doors at one end slam! open - JUDOON
      march in -

      People scream!  Stand, run, panicking - genuine, raw fear -

      But as they run one way, more JUDOON burst through the
      opposite end - the JUDOON CAPTAIN yelling:

                                      JUDOON CAPTAIN
                    Prepare to be catalogued!

      MORGENSTERN's behind him - ignored by the Captain -

                                      MORGENSTERN
                    Just do what they say!  All they
                    want to do is shine this light-
                    thing, it's all right, they're not
                    gonna hurt us, just listen to them -

      But people are trapped in the middle of the corridor, not
      listening, terrified, some crouching down, begging -

      One MAN picks up a chair, swings it at the nearest Judoon -
      it just breaks over his back, harmless.

                                      JUDOON CAPTAIN
                    Charge: physical assault.  Plea:
                    guilty.  Sentence: execution.

      And he lifts up his big, heavy gun -

      FX: a strong, thick, vicious red beam blasts out -

      FX: MAN screams, wrapped in red light, burns into nothing.

      All the people screaming now, desperate.  And the Judoon
      advance.  Grab people, one by one, begin the process, light,
      forehead, wip-wip-wip!, 'Human', X.  Morgenstern, helpless:

                    Justice is swift.

      The NURSES' STATION is the central part of the corridor, a
      wider open space with a big counter/desk, admin, etc.  THE
      DOCTOR sonicking the computer, MARTHA just running up -

                                      MARTHA
                    They've reached the third floor -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Sonic screwdriver.

                                      MARTHA
                    Well if you're not gonna answer me
                    properly.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It really is!  It's a screwdriver! 
                    And it's sonic!  Look!

                    What else have you got?  Laser

                    I did, but it was stolen by Emily

                    The Judoon must have locked it

                          (feverish)
                    Cos, I was just travelling past, I
                    swear, I was just wandering, I
                    wasn't looking for trouble,

                    But I noticed plasma coils around
                    the Hospital - like, that lightning,
                    that's a plasma coil, it's been
                    building up for two days now - so
                    I checked in, I thought something
                    was going on inside.  Turns out,
                    the plasma coils were the Judoon,
                    up above. 

                                      MARTHA
                    But what are they looking for?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Something that looks Human, but
                    isn't. 

                                      MARTHA
                    Like you, apparently.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Like me, but not me.

                                      MARTHA
                    Haven't they got a photo?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Might be a shape-changer.

                                      MARTHA
                    Well whatever it is, can't you
                    just leave the Judoon to find it?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    If they declare the Hospital guilty
                    of harbouring a fugitive...  They'll
                    sentence it to execution.

                                      MARTHA
                    All of us?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Oh yes.  But if I can find this
                    thing first...
                          (of the screen)
                    Oh d'you see?!  They're thick,
                    Judoon are thick, they're so
                      completely thick, they've wiped
                    the records!  That's clever!

                    Mr Stoker...?

      MARTHA hurries in.  And stops dead.

      Her POV: the TWO MOTORCYCLE COURIERS standing stock still,
      behind Stoker's desk.  She looks down...

      Legs, jutting out from behind the desk.  Mr Stoker's.

      And then - and she stares, can't take this in -

      FLORENCE rises up from behind the desk.  A terrible glint
      in her eye.  A chilling smile.  Her lips are very red. 
      She's holding a straw, which is now dark red.  And a drop
      of blood falls from it.

                                      FLORENCE
                    Ohh, kill her.

      of action, as he slams the door, sonics it shut -

      - but he doesn't stop - fast - shoves Martha towards the
        sealed-off-staff area (either behind lead-panels, or a
      separate room with glass partition looking into the room).

      the doors, it's locked.  But he's relentless, stands back,
      as far away as possible, then runs and hurls himself at
      the door - a genuine, massive smack - !

      Inside, the overhead camera is on a moveable arm - the
      Doctor sonics it so that it becomes even more mobile, swings
      down to his level on a metal arm -

      - Martha's found an instructions manual, reads, frantic -

        - Motorcycle Courier hurls itself again - smack - !

      - CU the hinges on the door beginning to give -

      - the Doctor's now got the moveable arm right in front of

      so it's sticking out the top of it - and he's holding the
      camera at his chest, facing the door, like a gun -

      - the Courier launches himself at the door again -

      - wham! - the door falls down flat -

      - the Courier stands tall in the doorway -

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Now!

      Martha slams down on the button -

      FX: FLASH!  The whole picture flares black & white, the
      Doctor's skeleton visible, the Courier with no bones, just
      solid mass - then back to normal, and...

      The Courier topples, stiff, like a statue - and as it falls,
      reveal the sign X-RAY DEPARTMENT behind it.

      Silence.  Martha still scared, behind her screen/partition. 
      (If it's a separate room, then this over a mic:)

                                      MARTHA
                    ...what did you do?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Increased the radiation by 5000%. 
                    Killed him dead.

                                      MARTHA
                    But.. isn't that gonna kill you?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Naah, it's only Rontgen radiation,
                    we used to play with Rontgen bricks
                    in the nursery.  It's safe for you
                    to come out, I've absorbed it all.

      Martha steps out, still staring, as the Doctor begins to
      shake and shudder, a little twitching dance -

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    ...all I need to do is expel it,
                    say, if I concentrate and shift
                    the radiation out of my body and
                    into one spot - say, my left shoe -

      And his little dance is focusing on his left foot -

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Ooh!  Ah!  There we go, easy does
                    it!  Out, out, out, ooh, that
                    itches, ow, ouch, hold on -

      And he whips off his shoe (and sock, all in one), shoves
      it in a yellow-plastic lined waste/sharps bin -

                                      MARTHA
                    You're completely mad.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You're right, I look daft with one
                    shoe.

      And he whips off his right shoe & sock, bins them.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Barefoot on the Moon!

                                      MARTHA
                          (of the Courier)
                    So what's that thing, where's he
                    from, the Planet Zovirax?

      The Doctor kneels down beside it.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Just a Slab, they're called Slabs. 
                    Basic slave drones, d'you see...
                          (squeezes its arm)
                    Solid leather, all the way through. 
                    Someone's got one hell of a fetish.

      He goes back to the X-RAY CAMERA, removes the sonic - 

                                      MARTHA
                    But it was that woman, Miss
                    Finnegan, it was working for her. 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    My sonic screwdriver!

      He holds it up; a crispy frazzle at one end.

                                      MARTHA
                    She was one of the patients, but...
                    Mr Stoker, she killed him

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It burnt out the sonic screwdriver!

                                      MARTHA
                    She had this straw, like some sort
                    of vampire -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I love my sonic screwdriver!

                    You called me Doctor.

                                      MARTHA
                    Anyway!  Miss Finnegan is the alien,
                    she was drinking Mr Stoker's blood.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Funny time to take a snack, you'd
                    think she'd be hiding, unless... 
                    No!  Yes!  That's it!  Wait a

                    internal shape-changer!  She wasn't
                    drinking blood, she was assimilating
                    it -

                    Prepare to be catalogued!

      As sc.28, people scream, run -

      But as the pattern repeats, FLORENCE is confident, just
      standing there.  Waiting for her verdict.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    - if she can assimilate Mr Stoker's
                    blood, she can mimic the biology. 
                    She'll register as Human!

      He marks an X on the back of her hand, stomps on.

      Right in front of THREE JUDOON.  The lead Judoon holds up

      PEOPLE now sitting against the walls of the corridor, all
      X'd, but lots of them are now clinging on to oxygen bottles
      & masks, breathing in deep, some couples swapping, sharing
      a mask.  But no sign of any Judoon.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Think think think, if I was a wanted
                      Plasmavore, surrounded by police,
                    what would I do - ?
                          (looks round, stops)
                    Uh oh...

      Signs at the far end, including an arrow towards MRI DEPT.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    She's as clever as me.  Almost.

      A crash! from the opposite direction, they look round -

                                                                            CUT TO:


      JUDOON yomping down the corridor, the PEOPLE exhausted,

      No Judoon in sight yet - THE DOCTOR faces MARTHA, square-
      on, fast:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Martha, I need time, stay here,
                    you've got to hold them up -

                                      MARTHA
                    How do I do that?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Just, forgive me for this.  It
                    could save a thousand lives.  And
                    it means nothing, honestly, nothing.

      And he kisses her!  Good three seconds.

      Then he runs off, towards the MRI SIGN.  On Martha.  She
      can't help it, she's kind of pleased.

                                      MARTHA
                    ...that was nothing?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Another long, echoing corridor - THE DOCTOR runs -

      Skids to a halt.  Ahead of him: the door to the MRI room. 
      the edges flickering with PRAC BLUE LIGHT.

      And the Doctor runs towards it -

                                                                            CUT TO:


      THE DOCTOR runs in -

      The room is humming with power.  Flickering blue light. 
      The MRI SCANNER fills one wall, and around it -

      FX: occasional arcs of blue lightning around the portal.

      In the SEALED OFF OBSERVATION BOOTH, FLORENCE is standing
      with armfuls of wiring, rebuilding the whole thing.

      And the Doctor acts like a Human as Florence walks calmly
      from the booth, into the room.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Have you seen?!  There are these
                    things, these great big Space Rhino

      Previously hidden from shot, MOTORCYCLE COURIER #2 steps
      out, grabs the Doctor, pinning his arms behind him -

      THE DOCTOR being all scared and helpless, held by the
      MOTORCYCLE COURIER, FLORENCE calmly walking round, adjusting
      equipment.  Power building, blue light flickering.

      FX: another bolt of electricity around the scanner.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Um, that big metal thing, is it
                    supposed to be making that noise?

                                      FLORENCE
                    You wouldn't understand.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    But.. isn't that a Magnetic
                    Resonance Imaging thing?  Like, a
                    ginormous sort of magnet?  I did
                    Magnetics GCSE.  Well, I failed,
                    but all the same...

                                      FLORENCE
                    A magnet, with its settings now
                    increased to 50,000 tesla.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    That's a bit strong, isn't it?

                                      FLORENCE
                    It'll send out a magnetic pulse
                    that should fry the brainstem of
                    any living thing within two hundred
                    and fifty thousand miles.  Except
                    for me.  Safe within this room.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    But hold on, I did Geography GCSE,
                    and I passed that one, doesn't
                    that distance include the Earth?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    But... you'll have to excuse me,
                    I'm a bit out of my depth, I've
                    spent the past fifteen years working
                    as a postman, hence the bunion,
                    why would you do that?

                    No, but that's weird.  You're
                    talking like some sort of alien.

                                      FLORENCE
                    Quite so.

                                    THE DOCTOR

                    You're joshing me.

                                      FLORENCE
                    I am not.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm talking to an alien?  In
                    hospital?  What, has this place
                    got an E.T. department?

                    It's the perfect hiding place. 
                    Blood banks downstairs, for a
                    midnight feast.  And all this
                      equipment, ready to arm myself, if
                    the police should come looking.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    So...  Those rhinos, they're looking
                    for you!

      She holds up her hand, the X mark.

                                      FLORENCE
                    Except I'm hidden.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Oh, right, maybe that's why they're
                      increasing their scans.

                                      FLORENCE
                    They're doing what?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Big Chief Rhino boy, he said, no
                    sign of Non Human, we must increase
                    our scans up to Setting Two.

                                      FLORENCE
                    Then I must assimilate again.

                                    THE DOCTOR

                    I'm afraid this is going to hurt. 
                    But if it's any consolation, the
                    dead don't tend to remember.

      And she advances, that awful smile, the Doctor helpless.

      Desperate, but clever, in control.

                    It's bigger on the inside!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Is it?  I hadn't noticed.

      And he runs to the console, full of energy, stabbing
      buttons, Martha following, cautious, up the ramp -

                                      MARTHA
                    ...but...  Is there a crew?  Like,
                    the navigator and stuff, where's
                    everyone else?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It's just me.

                                      MARTHA
                    All on your own?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Well, sometimes I have... guests. 
                    I mean, sort of friends, travelling
                    alongside me.  I had, there was,
                    um, recently, friend of mine. 
                    Rose, her name was Rose, and, um.. 
                    We were together, and... anyway.

                                      MARTHA
                    Where is she now?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    With her family.  Happy!  She's
                    fine, she's...  Not that you're
                    replacing her!

                                      MARTHA
                    Never said I was.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Just, one trip.  To say thanks,
                    you get one trip, then back home,
                    I'd rather be on my own.

                                      MARTHA
                          (cheeky, smiling)
                    You're the one who kissed me.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    That was a genetic transfer!

                                      MARTHA
                    And if you will wear a tight suit.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Now, don't.

                                      MARTHA
                    And then travel all the way across
                    the universe to ask me on a date.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Stop it!

                                      MARTHA
                    For the record, I'm not remotely
                      interested.  I only go for Humans.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Good!  Now then, let's have a look -

      He runs round the console, his back to her, and on Martha,
      for a second; looking at him, deflated, sighs; damn!




                                                                (CONTINUED) 3   -  Episode One   -   Shooting Script   -   28/07/06  - Page 53.Doctor Who

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Close down the Gravitic Anomalyser. 
                    Fire up the Helmic Regulator.  And
                      finally... the handbrake!
                          (to Martha)
                    Ready?

                                      MARTHA
                    No!

      He takes hold of a big console lever, grinning:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And off we go!

      Slams the lever -

      The whole room shakes, a violent jolt, Martha thrown, holds
      on to the console for dear life -

                                      MARTHA
                    Blimey!  It's a bit bumpy!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                          (reaches across)
                    Welcome aboard, Miss Jones.

      Still holding on, she shakes his hand, across the console.

                                      MARTHA
                    My pleasure, Mr Smith.

      And the Doctor gives the biggest smile, slams switches,
      throws levers, in his element.  Martha loving it.

                                                                            CUT TO:

6969FX SHOT

      The Tardis hurtles on its way, through the blue vortex, to
        destinations unknown.
