       We are the first manned vessel 
       to enter the Selcundi Drema 
       quadrant. Previous unmanned 
       probes have recorded unusual 
       levels of geological activity 
       in all five planetary systems. 
       I am hoping the Enterprise will 
       find the answer to this engima. 
 
 
     Picard and Troi cross to the horse, and Picard allows 
     it to smell his hand. He rubs her between the eyes, 
     and straightens the forelock. 
 
         PICARD 
       Hello, my beauty. 
 
         TROI 
       So you like horses for the 
       romance? 
 
         PICARD 
       It goes deeper than that. A fine 
       war mare would sleep in a 
       bedouin's tent, carry him into 
       battle, feed his children with 
       her milk. There is a bond which 
       forms from mutual need. 
 
     Picard inspects a forefoot. 
 
         TROI 
       Now I understand. You don't want 
       the comfort of a pet. You want 
       a companion.

     She reflects for a moment, looks a little wistful. 
 
         TROI 
        (continuing) 
       I had a Betazoid kitten once. My 
       mother and the cat reacted... 
       badly to one another. 
 
     She pauses as if considering how to phrase the words. 
     Then decides to just say it. 
 
         TROI 
        (continuing) 
       Captain, my mother and I share 
       a bond. She is going through a 
       difficult time, and I may need 
       to be with her. 
 
         PICARD 
       If you want leave, you need only 
       ask. 
 
         TROI 
       Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. 
 
         PICARD 
        (indicating the horse) 
       You're sure you won't try? It's 
       a good way to relax. We can get 
       you something quiet and gentle. 
 
         TROI 
       No, no. I prefer a mode of 
       transportation that doesn't have 
       a mind of its own. 
 
         PICARD 
       Strange. I should have thought 
       that Betazoids would be 
       outstanding animal trainers. 
 
         TROI 
       We become too involved in the 
       thoughts and shifting passions 
       of the beast. We lose our way 
       and become swept up in 
       emotionalism. 
 
     Picard checks the girth and the length of the 
     stirrups.

       ... this beast would be 
       far more terrifying. 
 
     Picard gathers up the reins and prepares to mount. 
     Then RIKER'S COM VOICE interrupts. 
 
         RIKER'S COM VOICE 
       Captain. 
 
         PICARD 
       Yes, Number One? 
 
         RIKER 
       We've entered the first system. 
       I think you might want to come 
       to the bridge. 
 
         PICARD 
       Something interesting? 
 
         RIKER 
       Spectacular and a little 
       terrifying.

       We are entering the second 
       Selcundi star system. I believe 
       the volatility of these planets 
       originated in the primordial gas 
       cloud which formed them five 
       billion years ago.

     is visible.

       It has been six weeks since our 
       entrance into the Selcundi Drema 
       quadrant. Each system has 
       revealed the same disturbing 
       geological upheavals on every 
       planet. 
 
 
     Picard crosses to the already saddled horse and strokes 
     her neck, straightens the mane, scratches her neck.

     Picard mounts. 
 
     Disappears into the trees. 
 
     There is a flash of horse and rider through the trees. 
 
     Picard rides toward the camera at the trot. He cues 
     the horse and rocks into a canter. 
 
     Cantering away from the camera, slowing to a walk. 
     Picard leans forward and pats the horse on the neck. 
 
     There should be no pass-by's because he is functionally 
     on a treadmill; or, if there is a ride-by, the horse 
     should be bent around Patrick's leg as if they are in 
     an arena. 
 
 
     Picard riding. Data ENTERS. He stands very quietly 
     until Picard notices him. Picard trots up and reins 
     in directly in front of the android. 
 
         DATA 
       I am sorry to disturb you, 
       Captain. 
 
     Picard dismounts and flips the reins over the horse's 
     head. Steps up to Data. 
 
         PICARD 
       Quite all right. It must be 
       important, or you wouldn't be 
       here. 
 
         DATA 
       Yes, Captain, it is important. 
       Very. Eight weeks ago I received 
       a transmission -- a simple four 
       word message: "Is anybody out 
       there?" I answered it. 
 
     He looks at Picard, but the captain is impassive just 
     waiting to hear the rest.

         PICARD 
       Dear heaven, you've got a pen pal.

       I have kept that somewhat vague. 
       But Sarjenka has been quite

       It was fascinating, but among

       alarming references.

     Picard's expression is beginning to look a little

       Captain, Drema Four is enduring 
       the same geological stresses we

       If we can determine the cause of
