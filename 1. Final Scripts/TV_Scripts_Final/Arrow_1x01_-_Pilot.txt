      A RUSTLE of leaves.  Disturbing.  Urgent.  SNAP INTO:

      Lush foliage beneath a darkening sky.  A BALETE TREE shakes.  
      Something climbing its way up.  We re INSIDE SOMEONE S POV 
      and CLIMBING fast.  Leaves and vines and green rushing past.

      More rustling and the CLIMBER EMERGES.  But it s no animal.  
      Impossibly -- this is a MAN.  His face obscured by a GREEN 
      HOOD cut from a sail s muslin.  TATTERED CLOTHING over a taut 
      frame.  He wields a COMPOUND BOW.  A QUIVER FULL OF ARROWS 
      slung around his back.

      From atop the tree, he looks out at the EXPANSE of BLACK SEA.  
      And then he sees it... far off on the horizon... 

      A FISHING TRAWLER

      The climber STRIKES AN ARROW like a MATCH -- quick and fluid  
      -- FIRING the FLAMING BOLT so fast we barely saw him string 
      the bow -- and we FLY WITH THE ARROW -- a straight shot down 
      to the BEACH below.  Striking a TARGET a hundred feet away.  

      A WALL OF FIRE IGNITES.  Pre-planned.  It s a signal fire.  

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    I ve never seen anything like it.

      EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - MAIN DECK - THAT MOMENT

      The CREWMEN atop the deck react to the FIRE erupting along 
      the coast.  They shout to each other in MANDARIN.

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    I ve never read anything like it.  
                    Except in 19th century literature.

      EXT. A BEACH - LATER

      A SMALL SKIFF rests on the beach.  THE FISHING TRAWLER moored 
      offshore.  The ship s CAPTAIN and First Mate -- both Chinese  
      -- cautiously approach the WALL OF FLAME...

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    The last thing anyone expects to 
                    find on a deserted island...

      A RUSTLING from the woods nearby.  The Captain pulling out A 
      GAFFE.  A precaution.  Eyes going wide to see --

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    ...is that it s not deserted.                                                                                            2.


      ...A PAIR OF BARE FEET emerge from the woods.  All bruises 
      and scars.  PAN UP as the FIGURE lowers his hood REVEALING... 
      a BEARDED YOUNG MAN. 27 years old.  Sun-bleached hair. Gaunt.  

      This is what is left of OLIVER QUEEN. 

      EXT. THE FISHING TRAWLER - (DUSK) LATER 

      As Oliver boards the fishing boat from the skiff, he looks 
      back one last time at his home for the last five years.  

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    The island he was found 
                    on is called  Lian Yu.   It s 
                      Mandarin... for  Purgatory.    

      We see the ISLAND fully for the first time.  Black and 
      silent, far from anywhere and everywhere.  It feels wrong.  

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    I can t tell you why he s alive...
                    Because for five years... that 
                    island did its best to kill him.

      Off Oliver, staring at the island.  A solemn good-bye to 
      what s been his home for the past five years...

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER

      Oliver s REFLECTION in a WINDOW.  A city s SKYLINE beyond.  
      He s clean-shaven now, hair cut.  His face angular, still 
      handsome.  But those eyes, still an enigma... 

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    Forty percent of his body s covered 
                    in scar tissue.  Second degree 
                    burns on his back and arms.  X-rays 
                    show at least 12 fractures that 
                    never properly healed...  

      REVEAL we re watching Oliver through an OBSERVATION WINDOW:

      INT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

      We ve been listening to DR. NEIL LAMB (50, kind, capable).  
      Talking to MOIRA (48, beautiful), a woman not used to being 
      shaken, but finding herself now on the precipice of tears --

                                  DR. LAMB
                    I want you to prepare yourself, 
                    Moira.  The Oliver you lost... 
                    might not be the one they found.                                                                                            3.


                                  MOIRA
                    Has he... said anything about what 
                    happened?  

                                  DR. LAMB
                    No.  He s barely said anything. 

      Anxious, she takes a deep breath, reaches for the handle...

      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Tentative, Moira steps inside.  Oliver s still standing at 
      the window.  Tubes snaking from muscular, toned forearms to 
      an IV stand nearby.

                                  MOIRA
                      Oliver...?

      He turns around, stares.  She takes a step forward.  Then --  

                                  OLIVER
                    Mom.

      Moira, of course, is MOIRA QUEEN.  

                                  MOIRA
                          (voice breaking)
                      Sweetheart.

      She swallows him in her arms.  Crying without realizing it.  
      Five years of loss pouring out.  Oliver smiles, grateful for 
      the embrace, but much too far out of practice...

                                  AN ANCHORMAN (PRELAP)
                    Oliver Queen is alive...

                    found by fishermen in the South 
                    China Sea two days ago.  Five years 
                    after he was missing and presumed 
                    dead following the accident at sea 
                    which claimed The Queen s Gambit...

      INT. A SWANK HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

      The TMZ coverage continues to play M.O.S.  TILT OFF the 60-
      inch LCD to the bed.  Sheets rustle.  FIND TOMMY MERLYN (28, 
      tall, dark, Devil-smooth).  He disentangles himself from a 
      SEXY GIRL (25, rocking bod).  Grabs for a water.  Spent.

                                  SEXY GIRL
                    Is this what you do?  Go to clubs, 
                    pick up women, have anonymous sex?

                                  TOMMY
                    No.  I go to bars sometimes.  Don t 
                    judge.  It s not as easy being a 
                      one-percenter as it used to be.

      Tommy s look catches the SCREEN and the TMZ story about 
      Oliver.  Tommy s eyes shoot wide.  Turning up the volume...

                                  CAT GRANT (ON TV)
                      ...Queen s return has everyone

                    did he survive all those years with 
                    no martinis or room service?                                                                                            5.

                    You lucky son of a bitch...

      Tommy JUMPS from the bed.  Grabs his clothes.  The outburst 
      sends a SECOND MOSTLY NAKED GIRL emerging from the bathroom --

                                  SECOND SEXY GIRL
                    What s going on?

                    He s alive!  Ollie s alive!!

      Tommy bolts out the door, SCREAMING down the hall.

                    Tommy Merlyn is dying to see you.

      INT. LIMOUSINE - MORNING

      Oliver in the backseat.  Moira sits opposite him.  She s 
      unnerved by his silence, talking for both of them --

                                  MOIRA
                    Your sister is nervous of course.  
                    But don t mistake that for 
                    anything.  Thea was so distraught 
                    for so long.  She never gave up 
                    hope though -- neither of us did.     

      But Oliver s distracted by the ICE CUBE he grabs from the 
      BUCKET in front of him.  He holds it, fascinated.   

                                  MOIRA
                          (unnerved)

                                  OLIVER
                    First one I ve seen in five years.

                                  MOIRA
                          (back to the subject)
                    The staff is excited as well.  And 
                    your father s friend... Walter 
                    Steele?   

      Oliver bristles.  A history there.  Tosses the cube back. 

                                  OLIVER
                    From the company?                                                                                             6.


                                  MOIRA
                    That s right.  He s been very 
                      supportive with... everything.  
                    He ll be at the house.  

      Oliver s look alters as he considers another question.  His 
      eyes flashing their first look of genuine concern.

                                  OLIVER
                    And Laurel...  How s Laurel?

      Before Moira can answer, we go...

      INT. CNRI OFFICES - NIGHT 

      City Necessary Resources Initiative.  Think legal aid but 
      with even less money.  Crappy office in a crappy part of 
      town.  DINAH  LAUREL  LANCE (28, blonde, smart sexy) is 
      meeting with DANIELLE DIDIO (70s, your grandmother).

      A CASE BOARD behind them has PHOTOS and ARTICLES tacked up 
      regarding ADAM HUNT.  An entitled grin on his face.

                                  MRS. DIDIO
                    I went to the District Attorney, 
                    the Better Business Bureau... 
                    everyone says they can t do 
                      anything...

                                  LAUREL
                    Because, technically, what Adam 
                    Hunt did to you -- what he did to 
                    dozens of people just like you -- 
                    isn t against the law.

                                  MRS. DIDIO
                    He took everything from me, Ms. 
                    Lance.  My mortgage, my retirement, 
                    it s all gone...  He took my life.
                          (fighting tears)
                    How can that not be against the law?

                                  LAUREL
                    It s... complicated, Mrs. DiDio.  

                                  MRS. DIDIO
                    So... you can t help me, either?

                                  LAUREL
                    We re suing Hunt in civil court.  A 
                    class action alleging fraud and 
                    predatory lending.

                                  LAUREL (CONT'D)
                    Mrs. DiDio, I am determined to see 
                    this man s head hung on the city 
                    gates like in the 1800s.

      For the first time in months, Mrs. DiDio feels a smile blossom 
      on her face, just as another lawyer, JOANNA (Laurel s age, 
      Laurel s friend) blazes in --

                                  JOANNA
                    Laurel.  You need to see this.  
                    Right now.

                                                                          SMASH TO:

      LAUREL and OTHERS in front of a TV.  The Starling EVENING 
      NEWS.  An ANCHOR reports, that now-familiar photo of Oliver 
      chyroned behind her --   

                                  ANCHOR (ON TV) 
                    -- Mr. Queen has reportedly 
                    confirmed he was the only survivor 
                    of the accident that took the lives 
                    of seven people --
                          (a young BLONDE WOMAN S 
                            PHOTO replaces Oliver s)
                    -- including local resident, Sara -- 

      CLICK.  Laurel intentionally snaps the TV off before we can 
      hear her last name.  She just stares at the black screen.

      EXT. THE QUEEN MANSION - ESTABLISHING

      The LIMO pulls up to A MASSIVE STONE MANSION surrounded by 
      vast grounds.  Old money.  American royalty.

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - THEA S ROOM - DAY

      Through the window, THEA QUEEN (17, Lolita, Oliver s sister) 
      watches the limo pull up the drive.  Behind her, her two BFFs 
      -- MARGO (17, blonde, trouble) and NIVA (17, Indian, ditzy).

                                  NIVA
                    I read on the internet he had  
                      frostbite.  Do you think his toes 
                    fell off? 

                                  MARGO
                    Your brother was hot, but there s 
                    no way I could get with a guy with 
                    no toes.

      Thea ignores all this.  Just stares out the window.  Worried 
      to her core -- she loved her big brother with all her heart.                                                                                            8.


                                  NIVA
                    What re you so freaked about?  It s 
                    a good thing... he s alive.

                                  THEA
                          (ignoring that; anxious)
                    You guys ve gotta leave before he 
                    comes in --

                                  MARGO
                    Not  til you calm down.  Roll call.  
                    What do we have?

      Niva reaches into her KNAPSACK, pulls out --

                                  NIVA
                    My brother s Ritalin and my mom s 
                    Valium.

                                  MARGO
                    Screw that.
                          (pulls out)
                    Thank you, Daddy s ACL tear.  Go 
                    with the Roxy s.  

      Margo pops out a pill, CRUSHING it to powder on Thea s desk.  
      She SNORTS, turns to Thea --

                                  MARGO
                    Your turn.

      She hands Thea the ROLLED UP BILL she used to snort the 
      powder.  Thea takes it -- practiced -- leaning down... 

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - KITCHEN - DAY

      WALTER STEELE (50, commanding) talks on a cell.  Watching the 
      LIMO pull to a stop through the window.  

                                  WALTER 
                    They re here.  We can discuss this 
                    in the office tomorrow.  Let s get 
                    him settled first.      

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - MAIN FOYER - THAT MOMENT

      RAISA (60, plump, old world) and IVAN (65, thin, kind) -- 
      both Russian, both house staff -- stare through their own 
      window.  They watch Oliver step from the limo. 

                                  RAISA
                    Well, we had five good years.                                                                                            9.


                                  IVAN
                    You missed him.

                                  RAISA
                          (covers)
                    And now I ll miss the quiet.

      Raisa talks a good game but we see she loves Oliver.  She and 
      Ivan are the closest Oliver has to grandparents...

      EXT. QUEEN MANSION - DAY

      Oliver looks up at his house.  As if seeing it for the first 
      time.  The driver POPS the trunk, is about to reach inside --

      -- when Oliver SPINS and blocks him.  A quick move.  

                                  OLIVER
                    I ve got it.

      Oliver bends to remove AN ARMY MUNITIONS TRUNK.  Weathered.  
      Marked with Chinese letters.  He holds it tight.  As if his 
      life literally depended on it.  

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - MAIN FOYER - MINUTES LATER

      The door opens and Oliver and Moira enter.  Oliver looking 
      like he s stepping onto the surface of Mars.  Walter 
      approaches, extending a hand.  Warm --

                                  WALTER
                    Oliver.  It s damn good to see you.
                          (beat)
                    It s Walter.  Walter Steele.

      Oliver shakes Walter s hand -- then walks past him.  Walter 
      exchanges a look with Moira.  Hers says,  He s fine.   His, 
       It s worse than I thought.   Oliver reaches Raisa and Ivan 
      who nod respectfully.  

                                  RAISA
                    Welcome home, Mr. Oliver.

                                  IVAN
                    Welcome back, Sir.  
                          (re: Trunk)
                    Can I help you with that?

                                  OLIVER
                    No.  Thank you, Ivan.

      An awkward beat.  Moira filling the silence --                                                                                            10.


                                  MOIRA
                    Your room is exactly as you left 
                    it.  I never had the heart to 
                    change a thing.  Or go in at all.

                                  IVAN
                    Mr. Merlyn phoned.  He wants to 
                    join you for dinner. 

                                  MOIRA
                      Wonderful.  Oliver did you hear 
                    that--

      Moira stops.  Oliver turns to see what quieted his mother: 
      THEA.  Standing at the foot of the stairs.  Beaming.

                                  THEA
                    I knew you were alive.  I knew it.

      She races to Oliver, clutching him tight.  If she s too 
      exuberant it s because she s also high.  

      Oliver melts into the hug.  This relationship, it s the one 
      pure, uncomplicated one in his life.  They speak so only they 
      can hear. 

                                  THEA
                    I missed you.  Every day I missed 
                    you.

                                  OLIVER
                    You were with me.  The whole time.  

      She smiles through her tears.  Her big brother is home.

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - OLIVER S BATHROOM - DUSK

      Oliver steps from the shower.  As the steam dissipates, we 
      get a good look at his bare body: insanely toned but covered 
      with SCARS.  A BRAND on one arm.  Numbers TATTOOED on the 
      other.  Healed BULLET WOUNDS on his legs.  A jagged SCAR 
      across his chest.  A road map of five years of unknown 
      suffering and the will it must ve taken to survive.  

      As we take in the injuries, A RAPID SERIES OF CUTS -- fast, 
      virtually subliminal -- torture -- blood -- pain.  Oliver 
      shakes the memories off.  

      LIGHTNING FLASHES outside.  ANOTHER FLASH, SMASHES us to:

      EXT. OPEN WATER - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

      BLACK WATER laps against the hull of the Queen s Gambit.  
      DARKENING CLOUDS billow overhead.  THUNDER in the distance.                                                                                            11.


      EXT. QUEEN S GAMBIT - MAIN DECK - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

      A younger Oliver emerges from the lower deck.  Shirtless.  
      Carefree.  The roiling clouds above can t dampen his mood.  
      He walks across the deck to where -- 

      His father, ROBERT QUEEN, confers with HACKETT (40, grizzled, 
      hard), Robert s head of security --

                                    HACKETT
                    Storm s a category two.  Captain s 
                      recommending we head back.

                                  ROBERT
                    Is it really that serious?

                                    HACKETT
                    When even the captain looks 
                    seasick, I take that as a bad sign. 

                                  ROBERT
                          (disappointed)
                    Not even two days out...
                          ( oh well )
                    Alright.  Back to Bahrain.  You ll 
                    inform the crew?

      Hackett dutifully nods, crossing paths with Oliver --

                                  OLIVER
                    We in trouble?

                                  ROBERT 
                    One of us is.

      He does not mean the storm.  

                                  OLIVER
                    Yeah.  She and I... just kind of 
                      happened...

                                  ROBERT
                    Things don t happen to us, Oliver.  
                    They happen because of us.  I wish 
                    that would settle in.   

      Oliver s heard that nugget before.  Ad nauseum.

                                  OLIVER
                    If I wanted a lecture I d be back 
                    at Stanford. Or Berkeley. Or Reed.

      From below deck, we hear a girl s voice:                                                                                              12.


                                  GIRL S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Oliver!  Where do you keep the 
                    bottle opener on this thing?!

                                  OLIVER
                          (calling down)
                    I ll show you.  One sec.

      Oliver starts toward the hatch --

                                  ROBERT
                    You know that won t finish well.  
                    For either of them.  Or you.

      Oliver shrugs.   What can you do?   And heads below.  Off 
      Robert, hearing Oliver and the woman s LAUGHTER ECHO... 

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - DINING ROOM - BACK IN THE PRESENT

      ON Oliver at the table with Thea, Moira, Tommy and Walter.  A 
      nauseated look as he studies the table before him.

      REVEAL a FEAST of RICH FOODS: STEAK, BROCCOLI with CHEESE 
      SAUCE, ONION RINGS.  He hasn t touched any.  Food s too rich.   

                                  RAISA
                    Would you care for something else, 
                    Mr. Oliver?

                                  OLIVER
                    A pear.  Do you have a pear?

                                  RAISA
                    I will see what I find, sir.

      Raisa exits.  Tommy takes over --

                                  TOMMY
                    Okay, let s see.  What else did you 
                    miss?  Super Bowl winners:  Colts.  
                    Giants.  Steelers.  Saints.  
                    Packers.  Black president, that s 
                    new.  Oh, and  Lost.   Turns out 
                    they were all dead.  I think... 

                                  THEA
                    What was it like there?

      Everyone stops.  Surprised by Thea s bluntness.  But eager 
      for the response.  A beat.  Then --

                                  OLIVER
                    Cold.                                                                                            13.


                                  TOMMY
                    Tomorrow, you and me, we re doing 
                    the city.  You got a lot of 
                    catching up to do.   

                                  MOIRA
                    That sounds like a wonderful idea.

                                  OLIVER
                    Good.  Then I was hoping to go into 
                    the office.

      Walter is visibly unnerved.  But tries to hide it --

                                  WALTER
                    There s plenty of time for all 
                    that.  I m sure your doctors would 
                    prefer you take some time.  Queen 
                      Consolidated isn t going anywhere.

      Some tension.  It s interrupted when Raisa returns with a 
      bowl of pears.  She proffers it toward Oliver -- but STUMBLES 
      -- the BOWL and PEARS spilling to the floor -- But Oliver 
      catches both.  Fluid.  Easy.

                                  RAISA
                    I am so sorry, Mr. Oliver...

                                  OLIVER
                          (a whisper)
                    Ni dlya kogo ne volnuites, Raisa. 

      Oliver looks over.  Realizes everyone is staring.  A beat.

                                  TOMMY
                    Dude, you... speak Russian?

      An imperceptible shrug from Oliver. Walter smiles, grasping --

                                  WALTER
                    I didn t realize you took Russian 
                    in college, Oliver.

                                  OLIVER
                    I didn t realize you wanted to 
                    sleep with my mother, Walter.

      Offered without venom.  Moira flashes an angry glare at Thea.

                                  THEA
                    I didn t say anything.  

                                  OLIVER
                    She didn t.                                                                                            14.


      FLASH CUTS:  Moira embracing Oliver at the hospital.  Oliver 
      shaking Walter s hand.  Oliver s nose.  Walter s COLOGNE on 
      his mother.  He smelled it.

                    I was -- I wanted to find the right 
                    time to -- to tell you.  Oliver... 
                    Walter and I are married. 
                          (Walter takes her hand)
                    I don t want you to think that we, 
                    either of us, did anything to 
                      disrespect your father...  

                                  WALTER
                    We both believed Robert was, like 
                    you... was gone and --   

                                  OLIVER
                      I understand.  May I be excused?

      Moira -- confused -- nods.  Oliver rises and exits.  Leaving 
      a quiet room in his wake.  A quiet beat.  Then --

                                  TOMMY
                    Raisa, I ll finish off his steak.

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - MAIN HALL - SECONDS LATER

      Oliver emerges from the dining room.  Pained by this 
      revelation.  Eyes finding A PORTRAIT of his FATHER on the 
      wall.  He studies it.  The MEMORY of A STORM echoing...

                                  WALTER (PRELAP)
                    It s strange...

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - MOIRA S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Walter CLOSES the window on the STORM now RAGING outside.  
      Thunder and lightning.  He turns to Moira in bed --

                                  WALTER
                    This sudden interest in the 
                    company.  I don t think he s set 
                    foot in the building since he was 
                    four.  And now it s the first thing 
                    he wants to do now that he s back?

                                  MOIRA
                    Maybe he craves something normal...

                                  WALTER
                    Exactly.  When has taking an 
                    interest in Queen Consolidated been 
                     normal  for Oliver?                                                                                            15.


                                  MOIRA
                    I want my son to reclaim his life 
                    as soon as possible.  Have the 
                    lawyers here tomorrow.  

      End of discussion.  Suddenly -- a loud BANGING.  Startling 
      Moira.  Worried, she rises and heads out to --

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      She walks over to Oliver s room.  Raises her hand to knock, 
      when -- BANG!  The sound again.  Startling her.

                                  MOIRA
                    Oliver?!

      She opens the door, looks inside and sees --  

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - OLIVER S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      The room is empty.  Oliver s gone.  The window is OPEN.  
      STORM WINDS BLOWING it -- BANGING it against the frame.  

      EXT.  QUEEN MANSION - THE GROUNDS IN BACK 

      MOVE ACROSS the well-manicured lawn and into the woods 
      behind.  Underneath the thick foliage is... OLIVER curled up 
      on the ground, sleeping like a man who s lived in the wild 
      for five years.  He s restless.  LIGHTNING FLASHES overhead.  

                                  GIRL S VOICE (PRELAP)
                    One... two... 

      The DISTANT ROAR of THUNDER takes us back to --  

      INT. QUEEN YACHT - OLIVER S CABIN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

      RAIN pelts the tiny window portal.  In bed, we find Oliver 
      and SARA (21).  We recognize her face from the TV in Laurel s 
      office and her voice from our previous flashback. 

                                  SARA
                    three... four -- 

      THUNDER echoes outside the cabin in the night sky.

                                  SARA
                    Oooo...  It s getting closer.

                                  OLIVER
                    That s not very scientific.                                                                                            16.


                                  SARA
                    What would you know about science, 
                    Mr. Ivy League Drop Out?

                                  OLIVER
                    Kicked out.  And I happen to know a 
                    lot about science.  

      Oliver moves to grab a bottle of WINE and two glasses.

                                  OLIVER
                    I know about... fermentation.
                          (pours the wine)
                    I know about biology.

      Oliver gets back in bed.  Kisses her...

                                  SARA
                    She is so going to kill me...  

                                  OLIVER
                    Only if she finds out about this 
                    weekend.

                                  SARA
                    And if this turns into more than a 
                    weekend?

                                  OLIVER
                    If I were to plan more than 12 
                    hours ahead, that d be a personal 
                    best. 

                                  SARA
                    I m starting to realize how we got 
                    into this mess...

                                  OLIVER
                    It s not a mess.  It s two people 
                    finding out if there s something 
                    more between them... 

                                  SARA
                    If that s all it was, I wouldn t 
                    feel so guilty.

                                  OLIVER
                    Guilt is the most useless emotion 
                    in the world.  When has anyone 
                    written songs about guilt?  It 
                    doesn t get anybody to do anything.  
                    Guilt just gets people to stop 
                    doing things they want to do.                                                                                              17.


      Sara swoons a little as Oliver kisses her again.  A LOUD 
      THUNDER CLAP!  Startling Sara.  She s nervous --

                                  SARA
                    That one was really close.

                                  OLIVER
                    Relax.  We re okay --    

      WITHOUT WARNING, the CABIN FLIPS UPSIDE DOWN!  They re thrown 
      about as the deck becomes the ceiling.  Sara SCREAMS.  

      Oliver -- BLOOD dripping from his head -- barely has time to 
      look up and see -- A WALL OF WATER RUSHING STRAIGHT FOR HIM!

                                  MOIRA (PRELAP)
                    OLIVER!

      EXT. QUEEN MANSION - REAR GROUNDS - BACK TO PRESENT

      LIGHTNING CRACKLES and Oliver wakes with a start.  Moira is 
      now standing over him.  Terrified.  His hand SHOOTS OUT -- on 
      instinct -- GRABBING her by the throat --  

                                  MOIRA
                    OLIVER!

      His eyes snap wide, releasing her quickly.  Horrified to 
      discover what he was doing.  

                                  OLIVER
                    I m... so sorry.  

      Moira studies him with shock and confusion.  Oliver s eyes 
      well with pain if not tears --

                                  OLIVER
                    What happened there -- it was 
                    horrible.

                                  MOIRA
                    I know, son.  You re home now.
                          (then)
                    Please, come inside, sweetheart.

      Oliver nods.  Allows her to help him to his feet.  We watch 
      as Moira tenderly moves with her son back inside, the RAIN 
      CONTINUES TO FALL... 


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                            18.


                                            ACT TWO

      EXT. QUEEN MANSION - OUTDOOR PATIO - MORNING

      The storm now replaced by a resplendent morning.  Moira and 
      Walter look on as a LAWYER takes Oliver through a stack of 
      papers.  But Oliver s far more fascinated with the lawyer s 
      iPhone.  He examines it -- amazed -- it s like magic, as --

                                  LAWYER
                      Death-in-absentia usually occurs 
                      automatically after seven years.  
                    However, in cases of imminent peril 
                    -- a boating accident, for example-- 
                    the court will grant a petitioner s 
                    request to declare the missing 
                    person deceased sooner. 
                          (an awkward beat)
                    We ll... delve into the quagmire of 
                    ownership position in light of your 
                      disappearance at a later date.

                                  WALTER
                    Oliver, I hope you understand, in 
                    light of you and your father s... 
                    absence, it was necessary to bring 
                    the company under the control of 
                    the board.

      Oliver says nothing.  Fixated on the iPhone.  The lawyer 
      points and Oliver puts the phone aside to sign.

                                  LAWYER
                      Congratulations.  You re alive.  
                    Again.

      The lawyer briefcases the documents and exits.  Moira flashes 
      a look at Walter.  She got her way.  She usually does.  

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - OLIVER S BEDROOM - LATER

      Dressed nicely, Oliver checks to make sure his door is 
      locked.  Then he reaches under the bed and pulls out the ARMY 
      MUNITIONS BOX, the one he protected so fiercely.  

      He UNLOCKS it and reaches inside, removing a MOLESKIN 
      NOTEBOOK.  Its pages worn by water damage.  He pockets it, 
      reaches back in to produce a piece of STONE.  Very old.  
      Asian pictograms inscribed on it.  Shaped like an ARROWHEAD.

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - THEA S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Thea on her bed.  Olympic caliber texting.  A KNOCK and 
      Oliver enters.  She lights up at the sight of him --                                                                                            19.


                                  THEA
                    Ollie --

                                  OLIVER
                    No one s called me that in a while.
                          (adding)
                    Speedy.

                                  THEA
                    Ugh.  Worst nickname ever.

                                  OLIVER
                    Always chasing after me as a kid, I 
                    thought it fit pretty well.

      He holds out the ARROWHEAD.  Offers it to her.  A gift --

                                  THEA
                          (no way)
                    You did not come back from a 
                    deserted island with a souvenir...

                                  OLIVER
                    It s a Hozen.  In Buddhism, it 
                      symbolizes reconnecting.
                          (beat)
                    I kept it, hoping someday it would 
                    reconnect me with you.

      She smiles.  Melting a little.  A nice moment.  One 
      interrupted by --

                                  TOMMY
                    A rock.  That s... sweet.  I want 
                    one of those t-shirts that says, 
                     My friend was a castaway and all I 
                    got was this crappy shirt. 

                                  THEA
                          (to Oliver)
                    Don t let him get you into too much 
                    trouble.  You just got back.  Take 
                    it slow.

      Oliver smiles at that.  As he heads out with Tommy -- 

                                  TOMMY
                    Have you noticed how hot your 
                    sister s gotten?
                          (off Oliver s look)
                    Because I have not.                                                                                            20.


      EXT. STARLING CITY STREET - DAY  

      Tommy s SLR McLaren cruises through the fog-shrouded streets.  
      A tourism BILLBOARD reads:   Starling City is a STAR City...  

                                  TOMMY (PRELAP)
                    Your funeral blew.

      INT. TOMMY S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Oliver looks out the window.  Sees a Blockbuster.  The sign 
      out front reads,  Out of business.   

                                  TOMMY
                      Unimaginative toasts.  So much 
                    crying.  I promised myself if you 
                    were ever found alive on a deserted 
                    island I would be honest with you 
                    about it.       

      Beat.  Oliver tries for  normal  --

                                  OLIVER
                    Get lucky?

                                  TOMMY
                    Fish in a barrel.  They were so sad 
                    and huggy.  I m counting on another 
                      target-rich environment for your 
                    welcome home bash.

                                  OLIVER
                    My what?

                                  TOMMY
                    Ollie, we partied when you got your 
                    license, when you got off for 
                    decking that paparazzi scumbag...  
                    You came back from the dead.  This 
                    calls for something so epic, the 
                    word  party  shouldn t even apply.

      Oliver s not paying attention.  His focus drawn to a HOMELESS 
      SKID ROW AREA of town.  Boarded-up windows.  Graffiti.  

                                  TOMMY
                    City s gone to crap.  Why d you 
                    want to drive through this 
                      neighborhood anyway?

      Oliver spies a  FOR SALE  sign in front of a DILAPIDATED 
      TENEMENT BUILDING.  Burnt out.  A method to his madness.                                                                                            21.


                                  OLIVER 
                    No reason.

                                  TOMMY
                    So what d you miss most?  Steaks at 
                    the Palm?  Drinks at The Station?  
                      Meaningless sex?    

                                  OLIVER
                    Laurel.

      Tommy reacts.  Bad idea.

                                  TOMMY
                    So you miss being punched in the 
                    face?
                          (then)
                    Everyone is happy you re alive.   
                    And you want to see the one person 
                    who isn t?

      Tommy shrugs, GUNS the engine, sure this is a bad idea...

      INT. CNRI OFFICES - DAY  

      The clinic s beleaguered STAFF -- including Joanna from 
      earlier -- looks on as Laurel argues with their supervisor, 
      ERIC GITTER (40s, so tired) --

                                  LAUREL
                    C mon, Eric, if we can t win a 
                    class action against a land baron 
                    who s engaged in mortgage fraud and 
                    predatory lending on a massive 
                    scale, we re not fit to call 
                    ourselves a legal aid office.

                                  ERIC
                    If we go bankrupt in the process, 
                    we won t be a legal aid office.  
                    Hunt s got an army of lawyers ready 
                    to bury us.
                          (almost apologetic)
                    You ve got 48 hours.  Then I m 
                    rolling this whole thing up.

      He exits. The staff looks to Laurel. Laurel looks to Joanna --

                                  LAUREL
                    Okay, you might ve called that.

                                  JOANNA
                    It s fun being your friend.  I get 
                    to say  I told you so  a lot.                                                                                            22.


                                  LAUREL
                          (to one of the staff)
                    Where s Judge Grell on our 
                    discovery motion?

                                  ATTORNEY
                    Not where we need him to be.

                                  LAUREL
                    The forensic accountant?

                                  JOANNA
                    Same story:  Needs more time, needs 
                    more money.

                                  LAUREL
                    Line forms behind me.  Idea 
                    window s open, people. C mon. Adam 
                    Hunt is not smarter than we are.

                                  JOANNA
                    No, just richer and willing to 
                    commit multiple felonies.

                                  LAUREL
                    We don t need to go outside the law --

                                  JOANNA
                    -- to find justice.  Your favorite 
                    jingle.

      Laurel smiles, about to rebut, when... she FREEZES.  At the 
      sudden, impossible sight of... OLIVER across the way.  By the 
      door.  Tommy standing behind him.   

                                  OLIVER
                    Hello, Laurel.

      Laurel just stares.  This conversation... confrontation... 
      has been five years in the making.

                                  JOANNA
                          ( wow he s hot )
                    You gonna introduce us?

      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CNRI - MOMENTS LATER

      A chasm of silence -- awkwardness -- between them.  

                                  OLIVER
                    You went to law school.  Just like 
                    you said you would.                                                                                            23.


                                  LAUREL
                    Yes.  Everyone s proud.  

                                  OLIVER
                    Adam Hunt.  Are you sure you want 
                    to mess with him?  

                                  LAUREL
                    Why are you here?  

                                  OLIVER
                    To apologize.  To tell you it was 
                    my fault.  To ask you, please, 
                    don t blame her --

                                  LAUREL
                    For what?  Being 18?  Falling under 
                    your spell?  How could I possibly 
                    blame her for doing the same things 
                    I did?   

                                  OLIVER
                    Laurel, I --

                                  LAUREL
                    She was my sister!  I couldn t be 
                    angry at her because she was dead.  
                    And I couldn t grieve because I was 
                    so angry at her.  That s what 
                    happens when your sister dies while 
                    screwing your boyfriend.  
                          (beat)
                    We buried an empty coffin.  Because 
                    her body is at the bottom of the 
                    ocean.  Where you left her.  

      The words sting Oliver.  Only because they re true.  Pained --

                                  OLIVER
                    I know it s too late to say it... 
                    But I am sorry.

                                  LAUREL
                    I m sorry too.  I had hoped you 
                    would rot in hell for a whole lot 
                    longer than five years.

      A dagger in his heart.  Laurel turns to go back inside, 
      passing Tommy standing just outside the doorway.

                                  LAUREL
                    How did you think this was going to 
                    go, Tommy?                                                                                            24.


                                  TOMMY
                    About like that.

      She heads back in.  Oliver watching her go.  Dying inside.

      INT. TOMMY S CAR - DAY

      Tommy drives.  Oliver sits quietly.  Still stinging.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Okay, so we got that out of the 
                    way.  Good call.  Now we re ready 
                    to make up for lost time.  If 
                    you re not too sick of fish I 
                    suggest we go find some leggy 
                    models and eat sushi off them.  
                    What do you say --

      In an eyeblink, Tommy s window fills with a VAN -- BARRELLING 
      STRAIGHT AT THEM -- Tommy SLAMS on the brakes --

      EXT. STARLING CITY STREET - DAY

      The Mercedes SPINS OUT coming to a stop -- the van screeching 
      to a halt -- blocking the Mercedes  path.  Then -- everything 
      happening almost too fast to process -- the van door sliding 
      open -- TWO MEN in GROTESQUE MASKS spilling out -- silenced 
        semi-automatics -- body armor -- moving with military 
      precision -- OPENING the doors of Tommy s car -- the crumpled 
      metal -- army boots crushing shattered glass --

      A HOOD over Tommy s head -- quick -- a chokehold, as -- A 
      BYSTANDER gets out of his car -- rushing toward the scene to 
      intervene -- to help --

      -- when a THIRD MASKED MAN leans out of the van wielding a 
      MACHINE GUN.  A TORRENT of GUNFIRE SLAMS the bystander to the 
      pavement.

      OLIVER sees the samaritan drop -- surging towards him -- a 
      YOUNG BOY -- the samaritan s son -- doing the same --

                                  BOY
                    DAD!

      The boy rushes to his father.  Tears streaming down his 
      cheeks.

      Oliver is transfixed by this heartbreaking scene, as -- a 
      hood comes down over his head.  Enclosing him in BLACKNESS.  

                                  OLIVER (PRELAP)
                    SARA!                                                                                            25.


      EXT. SOUTH CHINA SEA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

      Oliver floats by himself in dark frigid waters.  

                                  OLIVER
                    SARA!

      He DIVES below the surface.  Beat.  Then re-emerges.  Alone.  

                                  OLIVER
                    SARA!

      Desperation grows.  Oliver taking in a lungful of air, about 
      to go below again -- when a hand grabs him.  Oliver wheeling 
      around to see --

                                  ROBERT
                    Oliver!

                                  OLIVER
                    She s down there--!

                        ROBERTOLIVER
      No, Oliver, she s not --I ve got to --

      Oliver struggles -- Robert gripping him -- first to restrain, 
      then to EMBRACE --

                                  ROBERT
                    She s gone!  It s been twenty 
                    minutes in freezing water.  
                          (softer)
                    She s gone, Oliver.

      Oliver sags in his father s arms.  Surrendering.  A whisper --

                                  OLIVER
                    Please God...  No.  It s all my 
                    fault.  It s my fault.

      Oliver fights tears, as Robert tows him towards --

      EXT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

      Hackett, the security chief, reaches to drag them both 
      aboard.  Freezing, devastated, Oliver lies there shivering in 
      his father s arms.  

      Off the three men, floating atop the endless black sea...

                                  MASK (PRELAP)
                    Mr. Queen...?                                                                                            26.


      SNAP IN.  The hood YANKED off Oliver s head.  Oliver shaking 
      his head to get his bearings to see he s --

      INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

      Desolate.  Oliver s sitting on a wooden chair in the center 
      of the cavernous space.  Wrists ZIP-TIED behind him.  He 
      looks over, sees Tommy, head lolling, similarly bound.  

                                  MASK (O.S.)
                    Mr. Queen?

      Oliver looks up.  Three kidnappers.  Still in their GROTESQUE 
      MASKS.  The leader -- MASK -- stands over him.  Flanked by 
      GUNMAN ONE and GUNMAN TWO.       

      Oliver s eyes dart around.  Taking in the surroundings.  

                                  MASK
                    I ask the questions.  You give me 
                    the answers.  
                          (then)
                    Did your father survive the 
                    accident?  

      Oliver says nothing.  Mask produces a Gerber clip point 
      HUNTING KNIFE.  Rakes the blade across Oliver s chest, 
      cutting the shirt and the skin beneath.  Blood seeps.

      Yet Oliver doesn t scream.  Mask is impressed. 

                                  MASK
                    Did your father survive?  Did he 
                    tell you anything?

      Again, Oliver doesn t answer.  Mask moves the knife UP.  
      Against Oliver s neck.  The jugular.  Mask looks:  Well?

                                  OLIVER
                    Yes.  He did.

      Mask reacts.  That s more like it.  Looks to the others.  
      Then back to Oliver -- who smiles dryly through the pain.

                                  MASK
                    What did he tell you, Mr. Queen?

                                  OLIVER
                    He told me I m going to kill you.

      A confused beat.  Then... Mask laughs.  Then the GUNMEN join  
      in.  Oliver must ve lost his fucking mind on that island...                                                                                              27.


                                  OLIVER
                          (re: Gunman Two s weapon)
                    Galil 5.56 mm.  The man carrying 
                    the biggest gun is always the 
                    coward.  You, I ll have to hunt.  
                    You die last.
                          (then to Gunman One)
                    You think you re faster than me.   
                    You re wrong.  You ll get a shot 
                    off, but I ll kill you second.

      The laughter starts to die.  Replaced by anxious chuckles.  
      Oliver looks to Mask --

                                  OLIVER
                    And you, I m going to kill you 
                    first.

                                  MASK
                    You re delusional.  You re zip-
                    cuffed to that chair --

      Behind Oliver s back:  SHUK.  He DISLOCATES his thumb. 

                                  OLIVER
                    Not anymore.

      His thumb dislocated, Oliver s hand slips his bonds -- 
      shooting to his feet -- free hand SWINGING the chair around -- 
      KNOCKING Mask back -- the knife out of his hand -- the motion 
      continuing -- across his chest -- blocking the GUNFIRE from --

      GUNMAN ONE.  The bullets hit the chair -- SPLINTERING it -- 
      Oliver with two CHAIR LEGS in his fists now -- using them 
      like TRUNCHEONS -- Eskrima -- a Filipino martial art --

      He knocks Mask s gun -- it FIRES into the floor -- Oliver 
      DRIVING a chair leg towards his face -- depositing it in 
      Mask s eye.  Mask staggers back -- death throes -- as Oliver 
      hurls another CHAIR LEG into the chest of GUNMAN ONE.  GUNMAN 
      ONE DROPS.  The second to die.  As promised.

      It s suddenly QUIET.  The space empty.  Oliver was right:  
      GUNMAN TWO RAN.  

      INT. WAREHOUSE - HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER

      Oliver explodes out -- on the hunt -- legs pumping -- Olympic 
      pace -- rounding a corner -- into -- 

      INT. WAREHOUSE - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

      Gunman Two races down the stairs.  A Galil SAR fires 750 
      rounds a minute.  Gunman Two UNLOADS them all on Oliver --                                                                                             28.


      Oliver moves fast -- avoiding the GUNFIRE -- CAROMING off the 
      walls -- PARKOUR-like.  A predator.  Hunting Gunman Two -- 
      pursuing him down the stairs to --

      INT. WAREHOUSE - BOTTOM FLOOR - SECONDS LATER

      A labyrinth of STACKED PALLETS and SHIPPING CONTAINERS.  With 
      Gunman Two as he RUNS -- sending gunfire everywhere -- 
      bullets RICOCHET off metal -- WOODEN CRATES turn to dust...

      Gunman Two looks around -- cornered, frightened... desperate.  
      Where is Queen?  He fires again.  Spraying bullets.  Just to 
      be safe.  Then --

      CLIK.  The magazine is EMPTY.  Panic setting in -- he 
      hurriedly searches a pocket for a new clip, when --

      OLIVER DROPS FROM ABOVE -- punches the base of his spine -- 
      hitting nerve clusters -- Gunman Two DROPS.  Muscles suddenly 
      disabled.  Oliver hovers over him -- Gunman Two s eyes 
      pleading.  Terrified.  Desperate --

                                  OLIVER
                    You shot that boy s father...

                                  GUNMAN TWO
                    It was an accident -- I didn t mean 
                    to -- You don t have to do this...

                                  OLIVER
                    Yes I do.  You see...  
                          (dark)
                    No one can know my secret.

      Oliver SNAPS GUNMAN TWO S NECK!  KRACK!

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                            29.


                                          ACT THREE

      CLOSE ON... A SHADOWED FIGURE IN A GREEN HOOD.  A pencil 
      SKETCH.  It resembles Oliver when we first found him on the 
      beach.  Even more, it echoes a certain DC Comics hero... 

                                  DETECTIVE (O.S.)
                    That s your story?

      WIDEN to REVEAL we re:

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - SITTING ROOM - DAY

      Oliver sits on the couch, flanked by Moira and Walter as a 
      gruff, determined city DETECTIVE (50s) questions him.  
      Another detective, HILTON (40s, heavy), stands by --  

                                  DETECTIVE
                    You were abducted, brought to that 
                      warehouse, where you were 
                      interrogated, threatened when --
                    suddenly -- a guy wearing a green 
                    hood flew in and single-handedly 
                    took them out?  

                                  OLIVER
                    Yes, sir.

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Your luck never seems to run out, 
                    does it?

      An edge there.  History.  He stares daggers at Oliver, who 
      meets his gaze.  Moira slices the tension -- 

                                  MOIRA
                    Were you able to identify the men?

                                  DETECTIVE
                          (no)
                    Scrubbed identities.  Untraceable 
                    weapons.  These were pros who 
                    probably figured you d pay a King s 
                    ransom to get your boy back.  Or a 
                    Queen s ransom, as it were.  
                          (for Oliver s benefit)
                    A parent would do anything to keep 
                    their child safe.

                                  MOIRA
                    I don t find your tone appropriate, 
                      Detective.  Or, for that matter, 
                    your involvement in this case given 
                    the... personal circumstances.                                                                                            30.


                                  DETECTIVE
                    Take it up with the Chief-of-D s, 
                    then.  In the meantime, case lands 
                    on my desk, I work it.

      Walter stands.  This is over.

                                  WALTER
                    If Oliver thinks of anything else, 
                    he ll get in touch.  Thank you, 
                      gentlemen, for coming.

      Taking the hint, Detective moves to leave --

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Welcome home.  

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - OLIVER S BEDROOM - LATER

      ON A COMPUTER SCREEN:  A WGBS WEBSITE.  VIDEO FOOTAGE plays 
      of ADAM HUNT (Laurel s target) on an outdoor dais --

                                    ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)
                    ...here is Adam Hunt at the ribbon 
                    cutting ceremony for the waterfront 
                      re-gentrification project which is 
                    expected to net Hunt upwards of 
                    eighty million--  

      Oliver checks that Moleskin notebook.  It contains a LIST OF 
      NAMES.  One of them reads -- ADAM HUNT.  

                                  RAISA (O.S.)
                    You are different.

      Oliver turns, sees Raisa in his doorway.  

                                  RAISA
                    Not like you to read a book.

                                  OLIVER
                          (smiles, then)
                    I missed you, Raisa.

                                  RAISA
                    No kitchen on the island.

                                  OLIVER
                    No friends, either.

      A thin smile shows he means it.  Raisa blushes a bit.  Then --

                                  OLIVER
                    Do I really seem different?                                                                                            31.


                                  RAISA
                    No.  You re still a good boy.

                                  OLIVER
                    I think we both know I wasn t.
                          (off Raisa)
                    Too much money, not enough 
                      responsibility.

                                  RAISA
                    But a good heart.  

      Oliver smiles.  Moved beyond words.

                                  OLIVER
                    I hope so.  I want to be the person 
                    you always thought I was, Raisa.

      Raisa offers a knowing smile.  She has faith in him.  Exits.  
      Oliver returns the notebook to the MUNITIONS BOX and removes 
      a LEATHER POUCH...    

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - MAIN FOYER - LATER

      Oliver descends the stairs, ready to leave... when he sees a 
      MAN IN A DARK SUIT (35, Black, really, really big) standing 
      at attention by the front door.  This is JOHN DIGGLE.

                                  MOIRA
                    Oliver, I want you to meet, John 
                    Diggle.  He ll be... accompanying 
                    you.  

                                  OLIVER
                    I don t need a babysitter.

                                  MOIRA
                    This is something I need.  

      Oliver hesitates.  Then gestures to Diggle, who nods and 
      opens the door.  As Oliver walks through it...

      INT. LIMOUSINE - LATER

      Oliver in the backseat as the limo cruises the city.  Diggle 
      at the wheel.  Oliver studies Diggle s eyes.  

                                  OLIVER
                    What should I call you?

                                  DIGGLE
                    Diggle s good.  Dig, if you want.                                                                                            32.


                                  OLIVER
                    You re ex-military?

                                  DIGGLE
                    Yes, sir.  Army Rangers, 105th 
                    Airborne out of Kandahar, retired.  
                    Been in the private sector a little 
                    over four years now.  I don t want 
                    there to be any confusion, Mr. 
                    Queen.  My ability to keep you from 
                    harm will outweigh your comfort or 
                    desires.  Do we have an agreement?  
                          (no answer)
                    Sir?

      Diggle turns around.  Reacts.  What the--?  Oliver just 
      disappeared out of a moving car. 

      EXT. STARLING CITY STREET - SECONDS LATER

      Diggle jerks the limo to a stop, bolting out.  Scans the 
      street.  No sign of Oliver.

      INT. RUSSIAN MARKET - DAY - LATER

      A run-down BODEGA in the Little Odessa section of Starling.  
      ON OLIVER as he moves past shelves lined with caviar, canned 
      fish, and other Russian delicacies to the back where -- 

      INT. RUSSIAN MARKET - BACK ROOM - THAT MOMENT

      -- he sits before THE GEORGIAN (60, tatted, scary).  Oliver 
      spills a pile of DIAMONDS onto the table.  The Georgian 
      examines one, a JEWELERS LOUPE in his eye.  He looks up at 
      Oliver and smiles revealing a MOUTH FULL OF GOLD TEETH.   

      Off Oliver, completing Step One -- MONEY...

      INT. DARKENED SPACE - SOMETIME LATER 

      Location unknown.  Oliver, shirtless.  Muscles taut.  Scars 
      exposed.  Sweating, as he throws JABS and KICKS against a 
      STRIKING POLE.  Off his GRUNTS and the VIOLENT IMPACTS --

                                    REALTOR (PRELAP)
                    Are you sure you want to do this?

      INT. BURNT OUT TENEMENT - DAY

      Oliver, face concealed by a ballcap pulled low, holds a 
      briefcase, stands in the foyer of a BURNT OUT TENEMENT 
      building he spied on his drive with Tommy.  A REALTOR (50, 
      desperate) stands nearby.                                                                                            33.


                                    REALTOR
                    Not that I m looking to talk anyone 
                    out of a deal in this economy.  
                    It s just this building doesn t 
                    need a renovation so much as a 
                      detonation.

                                  OLIVER 
                      I understand the property runs 
                    right over the old subway lines.

                                    REALTOR 
                    Yeah, but if you re worried about 
                    trains whizzing underneath, don t.  
                    Those lines have been abandoned for 
                    years.  

                                  OLIVER
                    Will you accept cash?

      Oliver opens the briefcase.  It is filled with MONEY.  The 
      Realtor can t believe his eyes or luck.  

      Off Oliver, completing Step Two -- LOCATION...

      INT. BACK IN THAT DARKENED SPACE - SOMETIME LATER

      Oliver sits at a work bench, highly focused as he sharpens 
      metal.  Whittles shafts.  Trims feathers.  He is making 
      arrows.  We PRELAP a HORRIBLE DRILLING SOUND --   

      INT. BURNT OUT TENEMENT - BASEMENT - DAY

      Inside the filth-strewn cellar, Oliver wields a JACK HAMMER 
      on the concrete floor.  As concrete and dust get kicked up 
      into the air, and the floor begins to disintegrate --

      INT. THE DARKENED SPACE - SOMETIME LATER

      Oliver lifts his army munitions box onto a work table.  He 
      opens it and carefully removes a HAND-MADE COMPOUND BOW.  He 
      draws back the bow, testing the tension of the cables.  
      Satisfied, he reaches BELOW FRAME...

      From O.S. we HEAR a loud POP.  And then Oliver lifts into 
      frame... a just-opened CAN OF TENNIS BALLS.  Huh?  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A TENNIS BALL MACHINE shoots volleys of BALLS into the air.  
      THWIKT!  THWIKT!  THWIKT!  Oliver puts an arrow in every one.  

      The machine CLICKS, empty.  Oliver looks down.  The floor is 
      littered with arrow-impaled tennis balls.  He never missed.                                                                                            34.


      INT. BIG BULK SUPPLY STORE - DAY

      QUICK CUTS of Oliver stocking up on GEAR -- BOOTS.  GLOVES.  
      KNIVES.  Some Khaki-colored BODY ARMOR...  THEN the 
      ELECTRONICS DEPARTMENT... CUTS OF TECH AND GADGETRY.  

      Off Oliver, completing Step Three -- EQUIPMENT...

      INT. BURNT OUT TENEMENT - BASEMENT - DAY

      CHUNKS OF CEMENT BURSTING FROM THE FLOOR as Oliver HACKS his 
      way at a DEEP HOLE with a SLEDGEHAMMER.  He stops, shines a 
      FLASHLIGHT THROUGH THE HOLE.  He looks down and SUDDENLY 
      JUMPS DOWN and INTO...   

      INT. AN ABANDONED SUBWAY TUNNEL BENEATH - CONTINUOUS  

      ...Oliver lands on both feet.  He surveys the darkness with 
      his FLASHLIGHT.  

      The tracks stretch on into the dark and silence in both 
      directions.  The quiet is unnerving.  In evidence, a GRIMY 
      1950s BILLBOARD:   ARROWLINE -- GET THERE FAST .

      PULL OUT to REVEAL the subway tunnel is the darkened space 
      where Oliver has been plotting and training...  

      For the first time since Oliver has been back, he SMILES.   

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - MAIN FOYER - DAY

      Oliver enters.  Sees Moira.  She looks disappointed.  Behind 
      her is Diggle.  He looks pissed. 

                                  MOIRA
                    Mr. Diggle informs me that for the 
                    past two days, you ve been 
                      consistently sneaking away from 
                    him.  From the security I hired to 
                    keep you safe.  I think I deserve 
                    an explanation.

                                  OLIVER
                    I m sorry.

                                  MOIRA
                    I said an explanation, not an 
                    apology.

                                  OLIVER
                    I was alone for five years.  I was 
                    seeing someone... a woman. 

      Moira blushes.                                                                                              35.


                                  MOIRA
                    Oh. 

                                  OLIVER
                    But I ll take Mr. Diggle from now 
                    on.  Promise.

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      Oliver opens the refrigerator.  All that food.  Just a 
      fingertip away.  The simple things...

                                  TOMMY (O.S.)
                    The police came to talk to me about 
                    the kidnapping.   

      Oliver stops rummaging.  Tommy behind him.  Forced casual --

                                  OLIVER
                    What did you tell them?

                                  TOMMY
                    That I was unconscious.  And you?  
                    You okay?  You ve been back, but 
                    you haven t been... yourself.  Want 
                    to tell me what s really going on?   

      Tommy studies Oliver.  Reading him.  Searching.  Prompting 
      Oliver to adopt his  old  self, putting it on like a mask --

                                  OLIVER
                    You re right.
                          (off Tommy)
                    About having a party.  For anyone 
                    who forgot me, a party they ll 
                    never forget.  We can rent out that 
                    space downtown.  Remember, the old 
                    Iron Works building?  And we should 
                    invite Jessica C.  But...

                        TOMMYOLIVER
      ...not Jessica M....not Jessica M.

                                  OLIVER
                    And the Havins sisters.  Oh, 
                    whatever happened to Erika?  With 
                    the lips?  She was a rocket ship.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Got married about a year ago.

                                  OLIVER
                    So?                                                                                              36.


      Tommy stares at Oliver, then, his concerns allayed, relaxes.  
      Oliver selects A BOTTLE OF WATER from the  fridge, passing 
      Tommy and entering --

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

      The jocularity fades.  Being the old Oliver takes a lot out 
      of him.  He looks up at the PORTRAIT OF HIS FATHER.  Then 
      down at the bottle of water.  As he TAKES A SWIG -- 

      EXT. LIFEBOAT - SOUTH CHINA SEA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

      TIGHT ON SEVERAL BOTTLES OF WATER AND A FEW MREs.  PULL OUT 
      TO REVEAL Oliver, Robert and Hackett atop the lifeboat, 
      checking their meager rations --

                                  ROBERT
                    A few days.  Maybe.
                          (to Hackett)
                    Best guess?

                                    HACKETT
                    With the current, maybe a week from 
                    the Paracel Islands.  

      Oliver moves to the side of the raft.  Robert follows.    

                                  ROBERT
                    We re going to get through this, 
                    Oliver.

                                  OLIVER
                    Really?   Cause the no food and no 
                    landfall for a week say otherwise.

                                  ROBERT
                    We ll make it.  We have to.  
                          (then)
                    I thought I d have more time.

                                  OLIVER
                    For what?  

      He studies his son.  Then, hinting at a larger mystery:

                                  ROBERT
                    I started with nothing, Oliver.  
                    But the more I earned, the more I 
                    paid.  I paid with my soul.  Queen 
                      Consolidated s success was built on 
                    the pain and suffering of many.  
                    Pain and suffering I caused.  
                          (beat)
                    I failed our city.                                                                                            37.


                                  OLIVER
                    Dad, don t say that.  You re... 
                    you re a good man.

                                  ROBERT
                    You don t know me.  Not really.  
                    You don t know the truth.

      Off father and son, the endless sea all around them...

                                  TOMMY (PRELAP)
                    He s not who I thought he was.  

      INT. CNRI OFFICES - MAIN ROOM - DAY  

      Tommy and Laurel share a corner -- her STAFF works nearby.

                                  TOMMY
                    He s back, but he s... different.

                                  LAUREL
                    The sympathy card?  I was expecting 
                    the  We were just kidnapped  angle.  
                    That actually might ve worked. 

                                  TOMMY
                    I m serious.  He was out there for 
                    five years.  By himself.  God knows 
                    what happened to him.  God knows 
                    what he had to become.  To survive.

                                  LAUREL
                    You sound like a movie trailer...

                                  TOMMY
                    Listen, if you re worried he ll 
                    find out about us...

      A revealing beat.  Laurel laughs.  

                                  LAUREL
                    We barely qualified as an  us.   
                    Ollie s  death  just gave us 
                    something in common. 

                                  TOMMY
                          (hurt, changes subject)
                    Just come to the party. 

      He fixes a look.  The look.  She starts to crack --                                                                                            38.


                                  LAUREL
                    I m on a clock.  I ve got a boss 
                    who seems to think Adam Hunt s 
                    worth busting only if we can do it 
                    on schedule.  Hunt s a thief, he s 
                    only worse because he steals more 
                    and it s all technically legal. 

      Tommy leans back, smiling. Maybe even admiring her a little --

                                  TOMMY
                    Dinah Laurel Lance.  Always trying 
                    to save the world.

                                  LAUREL
                    Yeah, well, if I don t try to save 
                    the world...

      INT. ARROWLINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

      The space is decked out with COMPUTERS and DATA SERVERS.  A 
      TRAINING AREA with punching bags and dummies.  An ARSENAL OF 
      WEAPONS hangs from the wall.  In the corner we find... 

                                  LAUREL (V.O.)
                    ...who will?

      OLIVER as he reaches into the MUNITIONS BOX and lifts out the 
      GREEN HOOD he was wearing when we first met him on the beach.  

      INT. ADAM HUNT S OFFICE - NIGHT

      And now in the flesh -- ADAM HUNT (45, a shark, ruthless) -- 
      gets in the face of Laurel s boss, ERIC GITTER --

                                  ERIC
                    Mr. Hunt, I m sorry, but my people 
                    are determined on this --  

                                  HUNT
                    I don t care about your  people.  
                    You don t call off the dogs, I m 
                    coming after you, Mr. Grant.  After 
                    your house, after your law license, 
                    your kids  college funds...  I will 
                    shred your life and I ll do it 
                    because I can.  I ll turn you into 
                      a cautionary tale. 

      Grant nods.  Impotent.  Hunt stares at him for a beat.  

                                  HUNT
                    What re you still doing here?                                                                                            39.


      Two BODYGUARDS -- both large -- appear in the door.  He takes 
      that as his cue to leave.  Off Hunt, a disgusted sneer...

      INT. HUNT S OFFICE BUILDING - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

      Hunt and his bodyguards reach the elevator.  He presses the 
      button.  DING!  THE GREEN ARROW above the elevator GLOWS. 

      INT. ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER

      Hunt presses  LOBBY  on the panel.  The doors close.  They 
      stand there silently watching the LED SCREEN charting their 
      progress.   4... 3... 2... L... P1...   Hunt reacts.  

                                  HUNT
                    Piece a crap.  Passed the lobby...

       ... P2... P3... P4 

      INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

      The elevator doors open.  Hunt s men peer out.  It is quiet 
      and still.  Sensing danger, Hunt anxiously presses the 
      buttons.  No response.  

                                  HUNT
                    Check it out.

      Hunt s guards step out into the dimly lit structure.  Then -- 
      THWIKT!  SOMETHING STRIKES the ceiling light!  It SPARKS OUT, 
      enveloping everything in DARKNESS save for some SAFETY 
      LIGHTS.  One of the guards picks up the object that shattered 
      the light.  Reacts.  What the--? 

      IT S AN ARROW.

      The guard -- instinctively -- reaches into his suitjacket --

      THWIKT!  An arrow strikes him -- pinning his hand to his 
      chest -- pain dropping him to his knees, as -- the second 
      bodyguard pulls his gun -- FIRING WILDLY into the shadows.  
      BULLETS RICOCHET.  Car windows SHATTER.  Finally the gun 
      CLICKS empty.  Silence.  Then:

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    You missed.

      The VOICE is unnatural.  Inhuman.  Terrified, the second 
      bodyguard turns and runs back towards the elevator --

      THWIKT!  THWIKT!  Arrows embed in each of his thighs -- 
      collapsing him to the ground -- right next to the first 
      bodyguard -- both writhing in pain...                                                                                              40.


      Hunt looks into the darkness to see --  

      THE ARROW -- in BODY ARMOR painted a green so dark it s 
      virtually BLACK.  Bow at the ready.  His FACE obscured by 
      shadow and hood.  And a MASK covering the lower half of his 
      face, distorting his VOICE a little.

                                  HUNT
                    What do you want?  I ve got money.  
                    I ve got lots of money.

                                  ARROW
                    I know.  And I know how you got it. 
                          (an echo of the past)
                    You have failed this city.

      Arrow pulls out a card.  Drops it by Hunt.  A number on it --

                                  ARROW
                    Forty million dollars.  To this 
                    account.  By 10 PM tomorrow night.

                                  HUNT
                    Or what?

                                  ARROW
                    Or I ll take it.  And you won t 
                    like how.

      He turns to go.  Hunt is predictably undaunted:

                                  HUNT
                    If I see you again, you re dead.

      The Arrow spins -- instantly FIRING an arrow -- it WHIZZES 
      PAST Hunt s head -- drawing a THIN CUT across his cheek 
      before EMBEDDING in the elevator wall behind him.     

                                  ARROW
                    Same.  

      The Arrow disappears into the blackness.  Off Hunt wiping the 
      trail of blood from his face, seething.  And afraid...


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                            41.


                                          ACT FOUR

      INT. ADAM HUNT S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - MORNING

      Panoramic views of the city.  Hunt -- his face stitched --   
      paces, agitated from his experience the night before.  He is 
      in conference with the Detective.  Hilton watches nearby.

                                  HUNT
                    He was wearing a hood.  A green 
                    hood.  With something over his 
                    mouth and a goddamn bow and arrow.  

      The Detective and Hilton exchange a look.  

                                  HUNT
                    You don t believe me?  I got two 
                      bodyguards in the hospital. 
                          (re: his face)
                    You think I did this to myself?

      Hunt moves to a nearby table and tosses something at the 
      Detective -- AN ARROW.    

                                  DETECTIVE 
                    Thanks for your statement.  We ll 
                    put out an APB on Robin Hood.

                                  HUNT
                          (a warning)
                    I m not some grocer who got taken 
                    for his register.  I have your 
                      commissioner on speed dial.  I go 
                    to the front of the line. 

      Hunt exits.  Hilton turns to the Detective --

                                  HILTON
                    Looks like Queen was telling the 
                    truth.

                                  DETECTIVE 
                    First time for everything.
                          (a beat; then)
                    Get five or six sector cars here.  
                    A SWAT unit, too.  Have them 
                    establish a perimeter.  This hooded 
                    guy comes here looking for trouble, 
                    he finds it...     

      Hunt and the Detective share a  fuck you  stare.  The 
      Detective and Hilton exit.  Hunt looks down at the arrow.  It 
      practically says, I m coming...                                                                                             42.


      INT. LIMOUSINE - LATER

      Oliver -- dressed to party -- climbs inside, surprised to see 
      A DRIVER behind the wheel.  Diggle is in the backseat -- 

                                  DIGGLE
                    Put on your seatbelt, sir.

      Diggle is not taking any chances.  Oliver complies.  

      EXT. IRON WORKS BUILDING - NIGHT

      Oliver s limo pulls up outside the converted factory space.  
      PAPARAZZI snap photos of the guests.  Oliver alights --
      pausing for the cameras -- and makes his way inside. 

      INT. IRON WORKS BUILDING - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

      House MUSIC throbs.  Skin and money on display.  Oliver pulls 
      out his iPhone, checks the clock, activates the timer.  It 
      begins counting down from 1:00:00... 0:59:59... 0:59:58...    

      A deep breath.  Showtime.  He steps inside.  Crowd goes wild.  

      The DJ plays a TECHNO version of  We Are The Champions ... by 
      Queen.  Oliver accepts hugs and high-fives and air kisses --


                    PARTY GUYPARTY GIRL
        Welcome back, Ollie! Love you, Ollie!

      Tommy, martini in hand, finds Oliver --

                                  TOMMY
                    Man of the hour.  Ladies, give this 
                    man a proper homecoming.

      A trio of SEXY WOMEN -- skin-tight miniskirts -- envelop 
      Oliver -- one hands him a shot.  He downs it --    

                                  OLIVER
                          (to the crowd)
                    I missed tequila!  

      The crowd WHOOPS and HOLLERS.  Oliver Queen is back!   

      INT.  HUNT S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

      CLOSE ON A CLOCK.  IT READS  9:25 .  WIDEN:  Hunt waits.  
      Defiant.  PULL BACK to REVEAL... a CADRE OF BODYGUARDS 
      slamming CLIPS into AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.  A deadly arsenal.

      We notice the TECHNO MUSIC throbbing from outside --                                                                                            43.


                                  HUNT
                    What the hell is going on out 
                    there?

                                  BODYGUARD
                    Some big party across the street.   
                    For that Queen guy who got off the 
                    desert island.

      Hunt reacts -- CAMERA takes us out the window -- REVEALING... 
      Oliver organized his party ACROSS THE STREET from Hunt s 
      building.  All part of the plan...

      INT. IRON WORKS BUILDING - MAIN FLOOR - THAT MOMENT

      Oliver looks up, sees... Diggle.  Nearby.  Watching.  As 
      Tommy approaches Oliver.  Noting Diggle --  

                                  TOMMY
                    Does he wipe for you too?
                          (then)
                    Just FYI, five years off the job 
                    made you a virgin again, if you 
                    weren t aware.  As your wing man, 
                    I d highly recommend Carmen Golden. 

                                  OLIVER
                    Which one is she?

                                  TOMMY
                    The one who looks like the girl 
                    from Twilight.

                                  OLIVER
                    What s Twilight?

                                  TOMMY
                    You re so better off not knowing.

      Oliver looks, catching sight of Thea, Margo and Niva.  In 
      jailbait attire.  He reacts at the sight of his little 
      sister.  Here.  All (too) grown up.  And worse...

      ...she s talking to a charming DEALER.  He surreptitiously 
      slips a SMALL VIAL into her hand.  Oliver s jaw tightens.

                                  OLIVER
                    Back in a sec.  

      Oliver crosses over to Thea and her friends.  

                                  THEA
                    Hey Ollie!  This party is sick.                                                                                               44.


                                  OLIVER
                    Who let you in here?

                                  THEA
                    I believe it was someone who said, 
                     Right this way, Miss Queen. 

      Margo sidles up to Oliver --

                                  MARGO
                    Hey Oliver.  Do you remember me?  
                    Back then, I was...
                          (boobs forward)
                      ...smaller.

      But Oliver -- disinterested -- grabs Thea, pulls her away, 
      practically by her dress.

                                  OLIVER
                    What s going on, Speedy?

                                  THEA
                          (shrugging off his grip)
                    What s going on with you?

                                  OLIVER
                    You shouldn t be here --

                                  THEA
                    Uh, not twelve anymore. 

                                  OLIVER
                    You re seventeen.  You shouldn t be 
                    here --

                                  THEA
                    I love you, Ollie.  But you don t 
                    get to come back and judge me.  
                      Especially for being exactly like 
                    you.

                                  OLIVER
                    Thea... I know it couldn t have been 
                    easy for you when I was... away...

      Thea lets out a LAUGH.  It s kind of unnerving.

                                  THEA
                     Away?   So you ve joined the 
                    Euphemism Club, like Mom.  You were 
                    away?  Unavailable?  No, you were 
                    dead.  You died.  My brother and my 
                    father died.  I went to your 
                    funerals.                                                                                            45.


                                  OLIVER
                    I know --

                                  THEA
                    No, you don t.  Mom had Walter.  
                    And I had... no one.  Now you all 
                    act like it s cool, let s just 
                    forget the last five years.  
                          (then)
                    Well I can t.  For me, it s kind of 
                      permanently in there.  So I m sorry 
                    if I ve turned out to be some major 
                      disappointment but this... me... is 
                    the best I could do with what I had 
                    to work with.            

      Oliver starts to EMBRACE her.  But Thea isn t having it and 
      pulls away.  Oliver watches her head off with her friends --     

      ON THEA AND HER FRIENDS --

                                  THEA
                    Let s bounce.

                                  MARGO
                    You have the fun dip?

                                  THEA
                    Yeah, it s right --

      She stops.  Patting herself down.  It s GONE...

                                  THEA 
                    It s not -- I must ve dropped it...

      FLASH CUT:  Seconds earlier, Oliver surreptitiously swiping 
      the VIAL of DRUGS from Thea when he started to embrace her.  

      Off Thea and her friends, thwarted from any illegal fun... 

      BACK TO WHERE --

      Oliver checks his new iPhone.  Diggle eyeing him.  Oliver 
      turns in the opposite direction -- towards an EXIT SIGN -- 
      and bumps into Laurel.  She looks amazing and wasn t even 
      trying.  Oliver is shocked -- and overjoyed -- she showed --

                                  OLIVER
                    You re... here. 

                                  LAUREL
                      I should ve let you know I was 
                    coming.  Tommy invited me and --                                                                                            46.


                                  OLIVER
                    No.  It s fine.  I shouldn t ve  
                    dropped in like that before...

                                  LAUREL
                    I came to talk.  Mostly.  Is there 
                    somewhere quieter we could go?  
                    Like an erupting volcano?

      Oliver smiles -- nods -- has just the place.  He guides her 
      out -- through the exit where he was headed -- but STAY WITH 
      THE PARTY... FINDING... Tommy.  Watching them leave together.

      EXT. IRON WORKS BUILDING - ROOFTOP - MINUTES LATER

      Oliver and Laurel.  Hunt s building in the distance.

                                  LAUREL
                    I m sorry... about saying I wished 
                    you were dead.  That was wrong.

                                  OLIVER
                    I d be happy to be, if it meant me 
                    instead of her.

      Laurel sees it in his eyes.  He s sincere.

                                  LAUREL
                    About Sara...  There s something...   
                    I m afraid to ask... but I need to 
                    know.  When she died... did she 
                    suffer? 

      FLASH CUT:  Sara in the sinking yacht.  Screaming in terror.

                                  OLIVER
                          (lying)
                    No.  

                                  LAUREL
                    I think about her every day.

                                  OLIVER
                    Me too.  

                                  LAUREL
                    I guess we still have one thing in 
                    common then.

      BEEP!  Oliver checks the iPhone.  The timer reads, 00:00.  
      Hunt s time is up. Oliver swipes the screen, switching apps -- 

      ON THE SCREEN:  ACCOUNT 52... BALANCE... $0.00.                                                                                              47.


      Oliver frowns.  Hunt isn t playing ball.

                                  LAUREL
                    Something wrong?

                                  OLIVER
                    Just... someone who owed me some 
                    money.  Didn t pay.

      He looks up at her.  They share a brief and intense look -- 
      it s evident they re still very much in love.

                                  LAUREL
                    I can t believe I m saying this...  
                    But if you ever really want to talk 
                    to someone -- about what happened -- 
                    I m sure it wasn t easy for you, 
                    and if you wanted I could try to...

      Oliver s heart breaks knowing what he has to do next -- 

                                  OLIVER
                    Laurel, you always saw the best in 
                    me.  Even right now, you re looking 
                    for it, hoping that island changed 
                    me somehow, made me a better 
                    person.  It didn t.  Stay away from 
                    me.  I ll just hurt you all over 
                    again.  Only worse.   
                          (back to the party)
                    You should go.  I ve got five years 
                    of debauchery to catch up on. 

      She studies him.  Sad.  Disgusted.  

                                  LAUREL
                    You re wrong, Ollie.  That island 
                    did change you.  At least now 
                    you re honest.

      She heads back inside.  Oliver feels like he swallowed broken 
      glass, but... to business.  He moves into --

      INT. IRON WORKS BUILDING - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS 

      -- and starts pounding down the stairs, when --

                                    A VOICE (O.S.)
                    Something I can help you with, sir?

      Oliver turns a corner -- waiting for him... Diggle.

                                  OLIVER
                    Just needed a second to myself...                                                                                            48.


                                  DIGGLE
                    And I d believe that if you weren t 
                    so full of crap.  Party s this way.  

      Diggle gestures to a door.  Oliver steps forward, grabs the 
      handle.  Jiggles it.  A confused look on his face.

                                  OLIVER
                    It s locked.  

      Diggle passes Oliver, trying the handle himself -- and, in a 
      blur, Oliver has him in a headlock.  Diggle sags, out cold, 
      never having seen Oliver attack him...

      INT. IRON WORKS BUILDING - JANITOR S CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

      Oliver drags the unconscious Diggle into the darkened space.  
      Closes the door on him.    

      EXT. HUNT S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

      The towering building looms.  Hired muscle -- business suits 
      and machine guns -- visible through the windows.  Patrolling.

      Suddenly... SHUNK.  An ARROW embeds itself on the rooftop.  A 
      CABLE trails from it -- stretching across the wide expanse -- 
      back to the Iron Works Building, as --

      INT. HUNT S APARTMENT BUILDING - CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

      TWO of Hunt s men patrol.  Everything quiet.  For a beat.  
      Then -- AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- the two men REACT -- too 
      late -- coming around the corner -- moving fast --

      THE ARROW.  Bow in hand -- fires a bolt -- an arrow PINNING 
      one guard -- a Parkour-leap off the wall -- into a KICK --
      knocking the other unconscious, as --

      REINFORCEMENTS surge down the corridor -- spraying bullets -- 
      the Arrow firing off arrows -- fluid motion -- a deadly 
      ballet -- DISABLING the men one by one -- pinning them to 
      walls -- to the floor -- NEVER STOPPING his inexorable 
      movement down the corridor.  The sound of the violence is 
        DEAFENING...

      EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT

      ...but inaudible at street level.  DROWNED OUT by the lights 
      and TECHNO THUMP of the party across the street.  The COPS 
      standing guard outside Hunt s building don t hear a thing.                                                                                            49.


      INT. HUNT S OFFICE - APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Hunt s eyes react to GUNFIRE and bedlam outside his CLOSED 
      OFFICE DOORS.  Then -- even more unnerving -- silence.  He 
      finally looks scared.  His men grip their guns.  Ready for --  

      THE DOORS BURST OPEN!   

      The men answer with their guns -- the Arrow dodging -- moving 
      fast -- firing off arrows -- extremities -- nothing fatal -- 
      he s taken out ALL THE GUARDS WHEN -- HUNT produces a GRENADE 
      -- an insurance policy -- pulling the pin --

                                  HUNT
                    Choke on this, asshole --

      -- and HURLS it towards the Arrow.  Hunt VANISHES into the 
      SAFETY of the PANIC ROOM behind him.  The ARROW DIVES behind 
      HUNT S DESK while simultaneously firing off an arrow.  Like 
      the tennis balls, the arrow STRIKES the grenade in mid-air...

      BOOM!  THE GRENADE GOES OFF!  A MAELSTROM OF PAIN AND NOISE 
      AND POWER ENGULFS THE OFFICE!   

      EXT. STREET LEVEL - THAT MOMENT

      The policemen spin around -- looking up -- as the WINDOWS 
      BLOW OUT!  Reacting --

      INT. HUNT S OFFICE - APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      Behind the desk, through the smoke... Oliver.  Hood down.  
      Face exposed.  Blood trickles from his ears.  Unconscious.  
      Helpless... 


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                            50.


                                          ACT FIVE

      EXT. LIFEBOAT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

      CLOSE ON THE RATIONS BOX.  No more MREs.  Only one bottle of 
      water left.  Only three-quarters full.  WIDEN TO REVEAL:

      Oliver, Robert and Hackett.  Frail and weakened by lack of 
      food and water.  Floating in the endless sea.  

                                  ROBERT
                    Oliver...

                                  OLIVER
                    Don t talk, Dad.  Save your 
                    strength.

                                  ROBERT
                    I am.  You re my strength.  And I m 
                    saving you.    

      Wanting privacy from Hackett, Robert moves close to Oliver.  

                                  ROBERT
                    We re not going to last.  The three 
                    of us.  But you can.  You can 
                    survive.   
                          (then)
                    Make it back to Starling.  I ruined 
                    our city.  You can save it.   

      Oliver looks at his father.  Has he lost his mind?  

                                  OLIVER
                    Just rest, Dad --

                                  ROBERT
                    This is my penance.  This is what I 
                    deserve.  But you...

      Robert touches Oliver s face.  Tender.  Emotional.

                                  ROBERT
                    ...you re my absolution.

      ANGLE ON:  HACKETT.  He s been listening.  Doesn t like where 
      this is going.  He reaches behind his back and pulls out a 
      LONG KNIFE when -- 

      BANG!  Hackett is blown off the lifeboat, dead before he hits 
      the water.  REVEAL ROBERT is HOLDING A SMOKING GUN.  Oliver 
      cannot believe what he just saw.                                                                                              51.


                                  OLIVER
                    Dad!

                                  ROBERT
                    I love you, son.  Survive.

      Robert puts the gun to his head.  Oliver goes to stop him -- 
      but for the very last time in his life -- he s too slow. 

                                  OLIVER
                    No!!

      A SECOND GUNSHOT.  Oliver cries out.  His innocence shattered 
      forever.  He grabs onto his father s lifeless body, hugging 
      it close.  Off Oliver s tearful eyes WE DISSOLVE TO: OLIVER S 
      EYES in the present-- as they flutter open in...

      INT. HUNT S OFFICE - APARTMENT - BACK TO PRESENT

      Oliver winces from pain.  He wills himself to reorient.  He 
      peers out from behind the desk.  Sees THE DETECTIVE and a 
      team of SWAT OFFICERS spill into the outer hall.  He is 
      surrounded.  There is no way out.  

                                  SWAT LEADER 
                    Lay down your weapons or we will 
                    open fire.  I repeat, lay down your 
                    weapons!

      Quickly Oliver reaches into his belt and pulls out a SMALL 
      RED DEVICE the size of a FLASH DRIVE.  He does something with 
      it but we don t see what.  He then dons his hood.  Grips his 
      bow.  Looks to the SHATTERED WINDOWS.  And BOLTS out from 
      behind the desk -- 

                                  SWAT LEADER
                    FIRE!

      GUNFIRE ERUPTS -- The Arrow racing for the window -- dodging 
      bullets and shrapnel -- and he leaps -- OUT THE WINDOW!

      The Detective and the others watch as he PLUMMETS -- and 
      FIRES AN ARROW -- THWIKT! -- A CABLE TRAILING AFTER IT like a 
      comet -- the arrow EMBEDS in the parapet of the Iron Works -- 
      cable going taut instantly -- The Arrow swings across the 
      chasm -- CRASHING THROUGH A WINDOW of the IRON WORKS 
      BUILDING.  He s gone.

      Reactions.  Shock and stunned disbelief --

                                  SWAT LEADER
                    Someone say they saw that too.

      The team nods.  The Detective pulls his service weapon --                                                                                            52.


                                  DETECTIVE
                    LET S MOVE!

      INT. IRON WORKS BUILDING - MAIN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

      The party is raging.  Until... THE MUSIC CUTS OUT.  Everyone 
      turns and reacts -- the Detective and Hilton spilling in, 
      flanked by SWAT.  The Detective turns to the SWAT Leader --

                                  DETECTIVE 
                    Search the building.  Roof to 
                    basement.  Find him.  

      The SWATS move off.  The Detective addresses the party --

                                  DETECTIVE
                    This is the Starling City police.  
                    Party s over kids. 

      Tommy approaches.  The Detective smiles --

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Mr. Merlyn.  Imagine my shock at 
                    finding you here.  Roofied anybody 
                    special, tonight? 

                                  OLIVER (O.S.)
                    This is a private party, Detective.

      The Detective turns... sees Oliver.  Back in his suit.  A 
      drink in hand.  No sign of the ordeal he just went through.  

                                  DETECTIVE
                      Unbelievable.    

                                  OLIVER
                          (cupping his ear)
                    Sorry, the music s been loud...

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Know anything about Adam Hunt s 
                    place getting attacked?

                                  OLIVER
                    Who s Adam Hunt?

                                  DETECTIVE
                      A millionaire scumbag.  I m kinda 
                    surprised you aren t friends.

                                  OLIVER
                    I ve been out of town for a while.

      The Detective s WALKIE SQUAWKS.                                                                                             53.


                                  SWAT LEADER (OVER WALKIE)
                    No sign of him.

                                  OLIVER
                    No sign of who?

                                  DETECTIVE
                    The guy with the hood who saved 
                    your ass the other day.

                                  OLIVER
                    You still haven t figured out who 
                    that was?  If it d help, I could 
                    post a reward.  
                          (to crowd)
                    Two million bucks to anyone who can 
                    find a nutbar in a green hood.

      The crowd CHEERS in response.  The Detective steps up close 
      to Oliver.  Rage and pain bubbling over.  Quiet intensity --

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Did you even try to save her?

      Oliver s stomach plummets.  Unable to answer.  And that only 
      enrages the Detective further.  Hilton gets between them --  

                                  HILTON
                    Let s go, partner.

      The Detective -- eyes lit with hate -- takes a beat... before 
      allowing Hilton to lead him away.  Oliver turns... into THEA.  
      She heard their conversation.  Her disappointment palpable.  

                                  THEA
                    Did you try to save Dad?  Or did 
                    you just let him die, too?

      The look in her eyes -- the disappointment from the one 
      person he was closest to... it s almost too much to bear.  
      Words fail him.  Thea goes, exiting with her friends.  A 
      pained beat.  Oliver willing himself back into character --

                                  OLIVER
                          (back to the crowd)
                    It is waaay too quiet in here!  

      As the MUSIC COMES BACK UP, Tommy approaches --

                                  TOMMY
                    Some coincidence.  You asking to 
                    have your party here and then Hunt 
                    getting robbed right next door.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                            54.

                                  TOMMY (CONT'D)
                    And by the same guy who rescued us 
                    at the warehouse.  A guy I never 
                    saw.        

      Oliver clearly doesn t like Tommy s tone.  His face darkens.

                                  OLIVER
                    I thought you were unconscious.

      For the first time in his life Tommy is afraid of Oliver.

                                  TOMMY
                          (a lie)
                    I was.

                                  OLIVER
                    That s good... 

                                  TOMMY
                    What happened to you on that 
                    island?

                                  OLIVER
                    A lot.

      Oliver turns away, the costs of his lonely crusade already 
      evident...

      INT. HUNT S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

      WORKERS hang TARPS over the broken windows.  Hunt storms 
      about the ruins of his home, barking at an UNDERLING --   

                                  HUNT
                    I want the entire security system 
                      overhauled.  Card keys.  Motion 
                      detectors.  Everything military 
                    grade.  No one gets in here again.    

      Hunt spies an ARROW sticking out of his wall.  

                                  HUNT (CONT D)
                    Ever.  

                                  UNDERLING
                    Sir, your accountant is holding on 
                    line one...

      Hunt goes to his desk, picks up his phone --

                                  HUNT
                          (into phone)
                    What is it, Ron?                                                                                              55.


      Whatever Ron says, Hunt s face goes ashen --   

                                  HUNT
                    What the hell are you talking 
                    about??!  Forty million dollars 
                    doesn t just up and vanish! 
                          (then)
                       Untraceable?   IT S FORTY MILLION 
                    DOLLARS!  FIND IT!

      Hunt stops.  Sees the SMALL RED DEVICE the Arrow was holding 
      during the shoot out.  It is attached to his computer.  Shit.

                                  HUNT
                          (realizing)
                    It was a goddamn set up...

      Hunt slumps in his chair.  Broke.  And broken.

      INT. ARROWLINE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT

      CLOSE ON A COMPUTER SCREEN:  MONEY TRANSFER COMPLETE -- 
      AVAILABLE BALANCE:  $40,000,000    

      WIDEN TO REVEAL Oliver at the computer -- A SECOND WINDOW 
      opens:  CNRI -- CONFIDENTIAL -- E. STONE ET AL v. HUNT.  A 
      LIST OF NAMES cascades down.  A lot of names.  Hunt s 
      victims.  Laurel s clients.  The $40 million decreasing 
      automatically.  We know exactly where the money is going...

      Oliver opens the now-familiar MOLESKIN notebook.  Swipes a 
      pen across a page:  ADAM HUNT.  Oliver shuts the book.  

                                  MOIRA (PRELAP)
                    Did you think I wouldn t find out?

      INT. QUEEN MANSION - SITTING ROOM - LATER

      Moira is there, chewing out a chastened Diggle.

                                  MOIRA 
                    Passed out in a closet.  I think 
                    I m starting to understand how my 
                    son s been managing to shed you 
                    every day for the past week --

                                  DIGGLE
                    Mrs. Queen, I don t know what 
                    happened.  If you wish to fire me --

                                  MOIRA
                    I do.  And you are.  Fired.                                                                                            56.


                                  OLIVER (O.S.)
                    Don t I get a say?

      They turn.  Oliver s walking in.  

                                  OLIVER
                    It wasn t his fault.  It was a 
                    couple of ex-bouncers who had some 
                    beef with me.
                          (off Diggle)
                    We were in the stairwell, they came 
                    up behind you -- you never had a 
                    chance.  I tossed  em a few 
                    thousand.  It s all settled now.
                          (back to Moira)
                    I vote we give him another shot.   

                                  MOIRA
                    This isn t a game, Oliver.  This is 
                    your life.

                                  OLIVER
                    Which I value very much.  Besides, 
                    I think Dig and I understand each 
                    other.  Don t we?

      Very pointed.  Diggle takes a beat, then nods.

                                  DIGGLE
                    Yes... sir.

                                  OLIVER
                    Good.  See you tomorrow then.  

      Taking his cue, Diggle exits.  Oliver sits down, picks up a

                    What was that about?

                                  OLIVER
                    Nothing.

                                  MOIRA
                    Are you hungry?  I could have Raisa 
                    make us some dinner.

                                  OLIVER
                    No, thank you.

      An uncomfortable beat.  Moira fills the silence.                                                                                            57.


                                  MOIRA
                    I feel like I m doing everything 
                    wrong.  I wish there were a 
                    handbook on being the parent of a 
                    shipwreck survivor.  But there 
                    isn t...  
                          (then)
                    I know my relationship with Walter 
                    was a shock for you.  I tried to 
                    find a way to keep living after 
                    losing you, losing your father.  
                    And now I feel like you want me to 
                    choose between you and Walter -- 

                                  OLIVER
                    Mom...  I don t want you to choose.

      He takes her hand.  Moira, grateful for the opening, hugs her 
      son.  He returns the embrace.  Struggling to reforge a bond.

                                  MOIRA
                    I d love for Walter to have you 
                    down to the company tomorrow.  
                    You ll like the new offices.

                                  OLIVER
                    I m sure I will.  
                          (then, tired)
                    I m gonna head up, get some sleep.  
                    It s been a long couple of days.

      Oliver exits.  Moira s smile fades.

      INT. CNRI OFFICES - LAUREL S OFFICE - NIGHT

      Laurel is on the phone --  

                                  LAUREL
                    ...I don t think you have anything 
                    to worry about Mrs. DiDio.  But 
                    that said, as your attorney... if, 
                      hypothetically... $50,000 magically 
                    appeared in your bank account... it 
                    might be best not to speak of it.  
                    To anyone.  Ever.  
                          (then)
                    God bless you too, Mrs. DiDio.

      Laurel hangs up.  Weird.

                                  DETECTIVE (O.S.)
                    Strange day?

      Laurel looks up.  The Detective is there.                                                                                            58.


                                  LAUREL
                      Strangest.  

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Want to talk about it?

                                  LAUREL
                      Attorney-client privilege.  

                                  DETECTIVE
                    You know cops hate that.

                                  LAUREL
                    I think that s the point.

      The Detective sits down.  Weary.    

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Have you seen him?

      Laurel takes a sec.

                                  LAUREL
                    Yes.  

                                  DETECTIVE
                    He was throwing himself a party 
                    last night.  

                                  LAUREL
                            (uncomfortable)
                    Yeah.  I heard.

                                  DETECTIVE 
                          (it still disgusts him)
                      Celebrating his miraculous return 
                    from the dead.  I wanted to send 
                    him right back there.   

      The Detective studies A PHOTOGRAPH on Laurel s desk.  It s of 
      THREE PEOPLE: The two Lance sisters and their father -- our 
      Detective.  Quentin Lance.

                                  DETECTIVE LANCE
                    I keep thinking about the last time 
                    I talked to her.  On the phone.  
                    She said she was at the dorm.  At 
                    school.  But she was on that 
                    boat... with him.  I was at work 
                    when she called.  Busy with a case.  
                    Drug bust.  Nothing big.  But that 
                    day it seemed so important.  More 
                    important than talking to my 
                    daughter.  So I got off the phone.                                                                                              59.


                                  LAUREL
                    Dad...

                                  DETECTIVE LANCE
                          (emotional)
                    Maybe if I talked to her for longer 
                      I would ve realized she wasn t at 
                    college.  I could ve yelled at her.  
                    Told her to get her ass home.   

      He trails off.  Trying to keep it in.  Always keeping it in.  
      Laurel takes her dad s hand.    

                                  LAUREL
                    No, Dad.  The only lesson here is 
                    for both of us not to let Oliver 
                    Queen back into our lives.  

      Detective Lance nods.  Laurel changes the subject -- 

                                  LAUREL (CONT D)
                    So how s work?

                                  DETECTIVE LANCE
                    A puzzle.  This vigilante.  Hood 
                    and arrows.  It s surreal.

                                  LAUREL
                    Any leads?

                                  DETECTIVE LANCE
                    No.  The Mayor wants me to 
                    establish a task force.  Whoever he 
                    is -- we ll get him.  It s like 
                    I ve always told you Laurel...

      PULL BACK -- out through the window -- and up to:

      EXT. A ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

      THE ARROW stands atop the adjoining roof, looking down on 
      Laurel and Detective Lance.  Watching.

                                  DETECTIVE LANCE (O.S.)
                          (recalling Laurel earlier)
                    ...we don t need to go outside the 
                    law to find justice.  I believe 
                    that.  And by the time I m done, 
                    this guy ll believe it too.  

      EXT. AN EMPTY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      A LONE CAR is parked in the dimly lit lot.  Behind the wheel 
      sits a GRIZZLED MAN (45, reptilian, cold).                                                                                              60.


      After a moment, SOMEONE GETS IN THE BACKSEAT.  The GRIZZLED 
      MAN speaks but we don t see to who --

                                  GRIZZLED MAN
                    The police failed to identify the 
                    men I hired to kidnap Oliver.  And 
                    they never will.  

                                    A VOICE (O.S.)
                    Good.

                                  GRIZZLED MAN
                    Should we arrange another 
                      abduction?   

                                    A VOICE (O.S.)
                    No.

      REVEAL the person in the backseat... IS MOIRA QUEEN.  She was 
      the one that had Oliver kidnapped.  She shakes her head --

                                  MOIRA
                    There are other ways of finding out 
                    what my son knows.  

      With that, she gets out of the back and walks away.  Off this 
      shocking development, we go back to...

      EXT. THAT ROOFTOP - NIGHT 

      The Arrow lowers his hood, revealing Oliver s face.  We try 
      to read his expression, but we can t.  So much of Oliver, so 
      much of his story, is still a mystery to us.  We wonder now 
      more than ever what exactly happened to him on that island.    

      Oliver surveys the city as an evening MIST settles in.  WE 
      MATCH CUT TO: ANOTHER MIST FIVE YEARS AGO...

      EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - SOUTH CHINA SEA - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

      Oliver s lifeboat floats through the mist of the China seas.  
      Oliver s in it, looking lifeless.  After a moment, Oliver 
      HEARS something... the SOUND OF SEAGULLS.  Land is near.  

      He struggles to lift his head... his eyes searching the 
      horizon.  As the mist parts, he sees something in the 
      distance.  He rubs his eyes.  Convinced he s hallucinating, 
      he squints again.  And then we see it, too:

      AN ISLAND.
                                                                  SNAP TO BLACK.
