      Dark woods stretch into the distance, trees rustling in the 
      wind. Without warning, TWO TOYOTA 4RUNNERS hurtle past, 
      careening along the road. 


      Allison slips out of the house and into her car. At the 
      driver s side window, she breathes softly on the glass.

      The ghostly message from Scott that appears - 9 PM. Allison 
      glances to the dashboard where the time is 8:55. She quickly 
      wipes a hand over the steamed window to reveal--

      GERARD. 

      Allison SCREAMS. Her grandfather s stern visage softens to a 
      smile as she opens the door to get out.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/128.

                                  GERARD
                    Didn t mean to scare you.

                                    ALLISON
                    It s okay. I was just--

                                  GERARD
                    Expecting someone else?

                                    ALLISON
                    Yes. I mean--no. Definitely no.

                                  GERARD
                    Good. We can talk for a minute.*

      With a smile, he shuts the car door for her.


      A cell phone s display LIGHTS up, illuminating the woods 
      around Scott. He glances at the time: 9:00 PM. 

      Returning his gaze to the light-speckled town of Beacon 
      Hills, he searches the roads as if he might recognize 
      Allison s car simply by her headlights.

      But as the display light goes out, Scott s hopeful expression 
      seems to dim as well.


      Standing by Allison s car, Gerard pulls a SMALL PILL BOX out 
      of his coat pocket. As he removes it, however, something else 
      drops out--

      A worn, leather bound BOOK hits the pavement. Allison leans 
      down and picks it up, handing it to him.

                                  GERARD
                    Thanks. Don t want to drop that. 
                    I d be lost without it.

      He slips the book back into his jacket and dry swallows a 
      handful of pills.

                    When I was your age I didn t even

      Allison s eyes wander to the road, anxious to get going.

                    Trust is a commodity our family 
                    holds very high, you know.

      When she looks back, she finds him staring at her intently as *

                    A bit?

                    I like that. You remind me of her. 
                    She challenged me too.

                                    ALLISON
                    Is that what you want me to do? 
                    Challenge you?

                                  GERARD

                    you never question is family. Can I

                                    ALLISON
                          (nodding)
                    Yeah.

                                  GERARD
                    Not yeah. Speak with conviction. 
                    Yes or no?

      His sudden intensity causes her to flinch. Finding her voice, 
      she gives a response--

                                    ALLISON
                    Yes. You can trust me.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1210.



      Racing through the woods, Allison desperately tries to make 
      her meeting with Scott. But when she arrives at the lookout 
      point, she finds it empty.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott?

      She turns, trying to see in the darkness, when her eyes land 
      on something. She approaches an outcropping of rock to 
      discover a message scrawled in chalk--

      Couldn t wait. Missed U.

      Disappointed, Allison presses her hand to the rock and begins 
      carefully wiping away Scott s message.


      Under the flare of RED and BLUE lights from Deputy Sheriff 
      cars, Stiles sits in the back of an ambulance. He flexes his 
      now mobile hand while talking to his father, Sheriff 
      Stilinski.

                                  STILES
                    I told you, I just walked in and 
                    saw the Jeep on top of the guy.

                                  STILINSKI
                    What s wrong with your hand?

                                  STILES

                    Of course not. I just worry about *

                    don t say anything about it...

      Stiles looks away. That s exactly what he s afraid of.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1211.

      Stilinski turns, heading back to the crime scene.  

                                  STILES
                    Well, make sure they wash it!


      Amid the players gathering for the game, Danny and Matt talk 
      to Jackson.

                    Matt s the one who found it anyway.

      image showing a glitch in the frame.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Against the BRILLIANT GLOW of the LIGHTS, the body of a 
      BEACON HILLS MID-FIELDER soars gracefully up. And then 
      CRASHES brutally down.

      AT THE BENCHES - Stiles cringes. Behind him, the parents of 
      Beacon Hills look on with abject terror. The reason why--

      A HUGE PLAYER on the opposing team. He s a dense combination 
      of fat and muscle, towering over all the other boys.

                    Come on! Is that thing even a 
                    teenager? I want to see a birth 
                      certificate!

      THE REF blows the WHISTLE, ignoring him. Fuming, Coach sits 
      on the bench next to Stiles.

                    Who or what is that genetic

                                  STILES
                    Eddie Obomowitz. They call him The 
                      Abomination.

      Lining up for the next draw, the gigantic player known as The 
      Abomination strides past Jackson and Scott.

                                    JACKSON
                    McCall, what the hell are you 
                    waiting for? This is the semi-
                    finals. Bring that roid head into

                    the field is fair? Do something.*

      He throws a glance to THE BLEACHERS where Allison shivers 
      next to Gerard.

                                    ALLISON
                    I knew I should have brought my 
                    coat.

                                  GERARD
                    You re cold? Here, take mine.

                                    ALLISON
                    Are you sure?

      Nodding, Gerard slips his coat around her. Allison pulls it 
      tight, then discreetly searches the pockets. Removing a set 
      of KEYS, she turns them over in her hand. Gerard s OFFICE key 
      hangs off a USB DRIVE key ring. When she looks up--

      Another BEACON HILLS PLAYER crashes to the ground, 
      immediately followed by a SECOND PLAYER smashing onto him.

                                  GERARD
                    Good God, is it always this 
                    violent?

      The Abomination turns back with a malevolent smile. As his 
      immense frame moves past, he reveals--

      Matt, in his uniform, but on the sidelines snapping pictures. 
      Lowering his camera, he notices Melissa McCall sitting at the 
      edge of the bleachers, while a limping player is helped off 
      the field.

                                  MATT
                    He doesn t belong to you, does he?

                                    MELISSA
                    No. Mine s still on the field. 
                    While I m here really wishing he d 
                    stuck with tennis.

      THE PICTURE is of Allison. Perfectly lit under the field 
      lights, looking utterly beautiful, while--

      ON THE FIELD - Jackson steps next to Scott.

                                    JACKSON
                    If you re not going to do 
                      something, I will.

                    Get ready. Ball s coming to you.

      Noticing them together, Gerard turns to Allison.

                                  GERARD
                    Those are the two captains, right? 
                    Jackson and Scott?

      Allison gives a nod to her grandfather while her hand eases 
      down and drops the keys to Stiles, right underneath the 
      bleachers.

                                  ERICA (O.S.)
                    Go Scott!

      Allison spins back to see Erica cheering for Scott just two 
      rows up. The girl looks undeniably hot, almost as if she d 
      dressed to be noticed.

      ON THE FIELD - Ball in his stick, Jackson goes right for The 
        Abomination. Using a sudden and almost extraordinary moment 
      of speed, he slips around the larger player and sends the 
      ball flying to Scott.

      Ball caught, Scott whips around and FIRES it into the 
      opposing goal. The incredibly relieved Beacon Hills fans rise 
      to their feet, CHEERING wildly.


      Hearing the cheers as he rushes through the parking lot, 
      Stiles glances back. Then stops when he sees Lydia sitting in 
      her parked car. Tissues at her eyes, she s crying.

                                  STILES

      Lydia notices him approaching, she raises the window.

      But she won t lower the window or answer.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    You shouldn t care if anyone sees 
                    you cry. Especially you.

                    Why?

      Stiles comes closer to the window so he doesn t need to yell.

                                  STILES
                    Because you re beautiful when you 
                    cry.

      Lydia scowls at him. But then... the window begins to lower.


      At the benches, Coach leans down to Danny who holds an ice 
      pack to his head. Coach holds up two fingers.

                                  COACH
                    How many fingers am I holding up?  

                                  DANNY
                    Four.

                                  COACH
                    Say two.

                                  DANNY
                    Two.

                                  COACH
                    Perfect. Get back out there. 

      Coach slaps him on the shoulder as Danny rises shakily.

                                  REF (O.S.)
                    You re still short one player!

      Coach glances around.

      But Stiles, of course, is gone. Desperate, Coach quickly 
      scans the bleachers and points.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    You! Can you play lacrosse?

      Sitting next to Erica, Boyd gazes up. As heads turn to look, 
      he stands, taking off his coat to reveal a now sensationally 
      muscular body stretching every thread of his tight T-shirt.

                                  ERICA
                    Derek won t like this.

                                  BOYD
                    Yeah... But I will.


      Stiles leans in at Lydia s car window.

                                  LYDIA
                    You re going to think I m crazy.

                                  STILES
                    Lydia, if you trust me on anything, 
                    trust me on this... nothing you say 
                    will sound crazy to me. Literally 
                    nothing.

      Cheers go up again from the field. Stiles glances back, then 
      to the darkened school, knowing time is running out.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Can you give me five minutes? Just 
                    stay here. Continue crying. Or not 
                    crying. Whatever works for you. 
                    I ll be right back and we ll talk. 
                    About anything, okay? Five minutes.

      As she nods, Stiles darts off toward the school.


      Ball in the pocket of his lacrosse stick, The Abomination 
      charges forward. As Beacon Hills Players move to get out of 
      the way, only Boyd stands his ground.

      Cleats digging in, he drops a shoulder and COLLIDES with his 
      massive opponent. This time, the player flying through the 
      air is The Abomination. As his huge body TUMBLES to the grass 
      and dirt--

      Coach leaps up, HOLLERING.

                                  COACH
                    The bigger they are, baby! The 
                    bigger. They. Are!

      For the first time in far too long for a sixteen year-old, 
      Boyd smiles. Taking in the cheers. Basking in the glory.

      Even Scott s look of apprehension turns to one of conflict as 
      he watches the change in Boyd s confidence.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1226.

      But then Boyd notices Jackson looking at him with more than a 
      little curiosity. The look of someone who knows your secret.

      The Ref BLOWS the WHISTLE. 

      Heart pounding, Boyd turns back to take his position for the 
      next play, unaware that his eyes are beginning to GLOW 
      YELLOW.

      Now there are two werewolves on the field. One with far less 
      control over his abilities. And his anger...

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      With the game tied, THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK clicks down to one 
      minute left. Allison glances from the clock to her phone to 
      see a text from Stiles - Nothing here!

      ON THE FIELD - Scott lines up next to Boyd.

                                  SCOTT
                    You need to get off the field. Your 
                    eyes. Someone s going to see you.

      But breathing hard, Boyd doesn t listen. The WHISTLE BLOWS 
      and he takes off, moving fast. With no other option, Scott 
      goes after him.

      Eyes on the ball bouncing across the grass, Boyd races for 
      it. But Scott kicks in a second of super speed and gets to it 
      first, stealing it right out from under him.

      With the crowd hushing to near silence, Scott lets the ball 
      fly. As it hits the net, a winning goal--

      The Abomination takes Scott off his feet.

      IN THE BLEACHERS - Melissa stands, hands moving to her mouth 
      in the reflex of someone stifling a scream.

      Scott lands on his leg with a brutal CRACK.               TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1228.

      THE WHISTLE BLOWS, clock at zero. Beacon Hills has won.

      Shocked by Scott s fall, Allison springs to her feet. Gerard 
      looks up, noticing her concern. Without another second of 
      hesitation, she rushes down.

      Gripping his leg in pain, Scott sees Allison approach, 
      pushing past the other players.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    I m fine--it s healing--I m fine.

                    It s not in his office. It s got to 
                    be at the house. Scott, your leg. 
                    Oh my God, your leg s broken.

                                  SCOTT
                          (in agony)
                    Not... for long.

      Melissa, Coach and Gerard reach Scott who amazingly begins to 
      hobble to his feet.

                                    MELISSA
                    Scott--

                                  SCOTT
                    I m okay, I m okay!

      The crowd around him watches in disbelief as he gingerly 
      touches his foot back down to the grass. He gives a weak 
      smile. Allison notices even Gerard gazing on in surprise.

                                    MELISSA
                    I could have sworn I literally 
                    heard bone breaking from where I

      Allison takes Gerard by the arm.

                    Hold on. I want to ask him one more 
                    thing...


      Melissa McCall s car hurtles into the lot, tires SQUEALING to 
      a stop. Scott jumps out, putting his phone to his ear.  

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles, where are you? I need 
                    Gerard s keys. There s a USB drive 
                    on it. That s the Bestiary. 


      Scott plugs the USB drive into his laptop on the hood of his 
      mother's car while Stiles looks over his shoulder. 

      ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN - A document appears. Pages and pages 
      of strange black and white images amid thick paragraphs of 
      almost illegible text.

                    That s not English.

                    Is that even a language?  

                                  SCOTT
                    How are we supposed to figure out 
                    what this thing is?

                                  DEREK
                    No. Only when it was confused by 
                    its own reflection.

                    Just stories and rumors.

                    An abomination.

      Derek nods. He glances at Erica and they both move to leave.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek. We need to work together on 
                    this. Maybe we even need to tell

                    You d trust them?

                                  SCOTT
                    No one trusts anyone. That s the 
                    problem. And while we re arguing 
                    about who s on what side, something 
                    stronger, faster and scarier than 
                    any of us is killing people and we 
                    still don t know anything about it.

                                  DEREK
                    I know one thing. When I find it... 
                    I m going to kill it.


      Cutting the engine of his mother s car, Scott jumps out and 
      slams the door shut. But right before his hand can leave the 
      door, SOMEONE GRABS HIS WRIST.

      Whirling back, Scott sees Gerard coming at him with 
      frightening speed. A HUNTING KNIFE flashes in the moonlight. 
      The blade goes right into Scott s stomach.

      Gerard pulls him close, almost hugging him as he twists the 
      knife up. Clutching the man, Scott gasps in pain.

                                  GERARD
                    Don t move. Even though I can 
                      practically feel the tissue around 
                    the blade already trying to heal, 
                    you never know with a Beta.

                    after hearing good news from the 
                    doctor.

      Teeth clenched against the pain, Scott tries to hold still.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    That s right. I can play the nice,

                    and tell stories, be sweet and *

                    average, broken-hearted teenage 
                    boy. Are you listening?

      Gerard jerks the knife upward causing Scott to nearly 
      collapse in pain.

                    Scott, I truly believe that it s so

                    Yes.

      With a final jerk upwards, Gerard RIPS the knife out of 
      Scott s stomach as--

      THE DOORS of the hospital slide open. Melissa spots Scott 
      waiting for her. He awkwardly holds his coat in front him, 
      giving her the best smile he can. But she can immediately 
      tell he s not smiling with his eyes.

                                    MELISSA
                    Hey there. You okay?

      As Melissa loops her arm in his, she never notices the 
      numerous dark spots underfoot. Drops of BLOOD on the 
      pavement.
