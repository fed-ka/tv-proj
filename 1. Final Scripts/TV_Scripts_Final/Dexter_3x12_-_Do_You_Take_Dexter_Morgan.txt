                           Do You Take Dexter Morgan? 

    FADE IN:

    CLOSE ON MIGUEL PRADO S handsome face; eyes looking into 
    LENS.  Unblinking.

    BEGIN LONG CORKSCREW RISE TO REVEAL the ligature marks on 
    his neck.  CONTINUE RISE and we realize we re CRANING UP AND 
    UP and that we re --

    EXT. PARK - DAWN - DAY 111

    CAMERA CONTINUES TO CRANE UP and now we see Miguel s entire 
    body (pants and a tank top) on a spread of beautiful green 
    meadow.  It would be almost pastoral, almost serene, if we 
    didn t know that we re looking at the body of a dead man.

                        There are few milestones in life that 
                        evoke a stronger response than our 
                        final act...

    THE CRANE SHOT REACHES ITS APEX.

                        ... death.

    A JOGGER stops at Miguel s body.  Leans over to look, then 
    runs off...  

    A PATROL CAR arrives.  Then several others...

                        What was once moving, speaking,  
                        killing, and threatening... becomes 
                        nothing but an empty vessel...

    UNIFORMS spool out yellow perimeter tape.  PLAIN WRAP POLICE 
    CARS pull up.  A FIRE ENGINE...  

    TIME LAPSE CONTINUES as our Homicide Squad appears.  
    BATISTA, QUINN, DEBRA.  MASUKA gloves up and squats next to 
    Miguel s body.  He s joined by the forensics tech KAREN.  
    They re all disturbed, upset.

                        Which is not so different from how 
                        I ve always felt.

    NEWS VANS arrive.  Their satellites telescoping upward. 

      A CORONER S VAN pulls up some distance away.

    END TIME LAPSE AND MOVE IN FOR COVERAGE.

                        We all react in different ways to 
                        death.  

    Dexter looks off and notes RAMON sitting on the hood of his 
    car, looking lost and desolate.  He locks eyes with Dexter, 
    giving him a long, hard stare. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Some choose anger. 

    Dexter looks away, busies himself with taking photos. 

    ON DEBRA AND QUINN

                                        DEBRA
                        Why the fuck would the Skinner kill 
                        Miguel Prado?

                                        QUINN
                        Miguel was after Freebo.  George King 
                        had to figure he knew something.

    Dexter turns to see LAGUERTA step out of her car and 
    approach Miguel.  She gets halfway there and freezes.  Then 
    she makes the sign of the cross.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.) 
                        Others cling to ritual. 

    LaGuerta finds the strength to join her team.

    Dexter leans in to take a photo.  Batista sidles up to him, 
    speaks in a hushed tone.

                                        BATISTA
                        Dex, I know he was your friend.  If 
                        you want to take a pass on this --

                                        DEXTER
                                (somber)

                        Me: I ll play the grieving friend who 
                        buries himself in his work. 

    Masuka motions to the EMTs that he s done.  They slide 
    Miguel s body onto a stretcher and gently lift him up.  

    Batista, and all the nearby Unis respectfully remove their 
    hats.  Others put their hands over their hearts.

    Batista nods toward several of the Unis, and an impromptu 
    honor line forms, stretching all the way back to the 
    Coroner s van.  All work stops, everyone is silent.  

    The EMTs carry Miguel s body down the line.  It s a somber, 
    ceremonial procession.  Dexter starts for the Coroner s van. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        You can tell a lot about a person by 
                        the friends he keeps. 

    Dexter meets Miguel s body at the van, and solemnly looks 
    down at it. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        This is my best friend... Goodbye, 
                        Miguel. 

    Dexter starts to reach for Miguel, to close his eyes, but a 
    hand suddenly grabs his forearm in a vise-like grip.  It s 
    Ramon, glaring at him with pure hatred. 

                                        RAMON
                        Don t you fucking touch my brother. 

                                        DEXTER
                        Let go of my arm... Now. 

    Ramon shoulders Dexter around to the side of the van, out of 
    view of the others.  He gets right in Dexter s face --

                                        RAMON
                        I m going to find out why this 
                        happened.

    Dexter meets his accusing glare.

                                        DEXTER
                        We all want the same thing, Ramon.

    Ramon gives him a contemptuous glare, turns and storms away.

    INT. RITA S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY 222

    START CLOSE on the floral, cheery invitation to Rita and 
    Dexter s wedding, lying on the counter.  Then a FUNERAL CARD 
    is set next to it, which reads  Miguel Luis Prado.    

    PULL BACK TO INCLUDE RITA who just laid it down.  And Dexter 
    who pulls off his suit jacket.  They re both in black, 
    having just arrived home from a funeral.  

                                        DEXTER
                        Well, that was awkward.  I ve never 
                        been asked to leave a funeral before. 

                                        RITA
                        Ramon didn t ask; he pushed you out 
                        the door.  

                                        DEXTER
                        He was drunk.

                        Yeah, I could smell the fumes.  He s 
                        just so angry.

                        He s lost two brothers.  Doesn t know 
                        who to blame. 

                                        RITA
                        Well, certainly not you.

                        No, certainly not me. 

    Rita turns to Dexter.

    Rita gives him a comforting squeeze.

                        Even if Miguel wasn t exactly the man 
                        you thought he was, you still lost a 
                        friend.  You don t have to be so 
                        strong.

                        Life goes on. 

    She smiles, moves into the kitchen as Dexter notices a small 
    stack of mail, on top of which is an envelope. 

    INSERT - ENVELOPE 

    It s addressed to  Dexter Morgan and Rita Bennet.   The 
    return address reads,  Gail Brandon, 321 Elmview Lane,

    belongings destroyed.  

    Gloved UNIFORMS filter in and out of rooms.  A TECH dusts 
    Dexter s overturned desk.  Another TECH dusts the air 
    conditioner.  Before Dexter can protest, a plainclothes 
    detective, PRATT, approaches.

    hug, moves to receive it but realizes that wasn t his

    Shakes it.  They hold the shake a moment before releasing

    Syl approaches Dexter and Rita from the dining room, her 
    mood understandably subdued.

    Just then, RAMON lurches into the restaurant.  Everyone sees 
    him and tenses.  This can t be good.

    Dexter stays close to Ramon, speaking in a quiet tone.

    In the background behind Ramon, Dexter spots Batista and 
    Debra arriving late to the party.  Dexter choreographs 
    himself so as to keep Ramon s attention focused on him and 
    away from Debra and Batista, who suddenly read the situation

    Dexter looks around the room at the startled guests.

    THE SCREEN GOES WHITE.  RESOLVE to a window, morning sun 
    pouring in.  RESOLVE FURTHER and we see metal bars on the 
    window.  We re -

    (FORMERLY SCENE B25)

    Dexter, his anger barely in check, paces in front of the 
    window - adrenaline personified.

    An O.S. door opens heavily.  Dexter turns to SEE -

    RAMON, in an orange jumpsuit, shambling in between two 
    Sheriff s Deputies.  His face is bruised from the takedown 
    at the rehearsal dinner.  His wrists and ankles are 
    shackled.

    The Deputies lead him to a table.  He sits and they cuff his 
    wrist-shackles to the arms of the steel chair.  DEPUTY #1 
    looks to Dexter with contempt.

                                        DEPUTY #1
                        By the book, Mr. Morgan.

                          Lieutenant.

    The Deputies exit, leaving Dexter and Ramon alone.  Dexter 
    regards Ramon from the other side of the room.  Finally -

                        You want it to?

    Debra s confused at this line of questioning.

                                        DEBRA
                        Um... I don t... I... he could be a 
                        key witness in my case.

                        Doesn t have to be your case.

    Debra looks at her, then throws up her hands.

                                        DEBRA
                        You know what?  Go ahead.  Take away 
                        my case.  Take away my shield.  I 
                        don t care anymore.  Because it wasn t 
                        a wrong decision.  I wanted to be with

                        probe?

    LaGuerta walks around to her desk to pull open a drawer, but

    Beat, as LaGuerta closes Ellen s file and puts it in the 
    drawer, her hand lingering on it, but ultimately deciding it 
    will forever be her secret.

    INT. OLD CIGAR FACTORY - SECOND FLOOR - DAY 52929

    CLOSE ON DEXTER S FACE - eyes closed.  Then... abruptly, he 
    blinks awake.  Beat.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Such a familiar situation...

    INCLUDE him lying face-up on a table, his hands dangling off 
    the sides, wrists securely tied with rope.  The factory is 
      long-abandoned.  It s filled with the junk that squatters 
    would leave behind: a few old bedrolls, a rickety table with 
    a couple chairs, garbage from various meals.  An elevated 
    catwalk extends off into the distance.  King s truck is 
    parked below. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Such an unfamiliar perspective.

    He pulls his right hand up, it yanks his left hand down.  
    They re tied with the same rope that runs under the table.  

    Finally, he cranes around to SEE George King, across the 
    room, standing by a window, watching Dexter.  Just looking 
    at him.  No emotion.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        George King.  So Ramon wasn t the only 
                        one following me.  I underestimated 
                        Miguel after all. 

    King continues to stare. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Ah yes.  This is the part where my 
                        fear is supposed to build.  I know his 
                        M.O. by heart.

                                        HARRY (O.S.)
                        But you re not afraid.

    Dexter looks over to find Harry standing next to him, face 
    filled with concern, grief.

                                        DEXTER
                        No.  I m not.

                                        HARRY
                        I am.  I ve been scared of it coming 
                        to this your whole life.  A violent 
                        end.  I tried to protect you.

                                        DEXTER
                        And you did.  This is my fault for not 
                        trusting you.  Instead I trust Miguel

    Harry, emotional, moves closer to Dexter.

    Harry and Dexter share a meaningful look.  

    Then determination settles into Dexter s face.  He looks 
    over at George King who simply watches him with cold, 
      emotionless eyes.  Off Dexter, his mind working...DEXTER 312   "Do You Take Dexter Morgan?"    Final Collated  10/23/08 41.

                        I killed Freebo.

                        Sorry  bout that.

    King blinks.  That got his attention.  King slowly rises, 
    walks toward Dexter, studying this very different animal 
    lying on his table as --

                        I tied him up, not unlike this.  
                        Stabbed him in the left carotid 
                        artery.  Used a sixteen inch carbon 
                        steel bone saw to separate his limbs --

    King leans on the table -- it rocks, its legs uneven.  
    Dexter takes note.

                                        GEORGE KING

                        Why would you have done such a thing?

                        I have excuses, justifications.  But 
                        really?  I just... need to.  Like you 
                        do.  I mean, you have your flimsy 
                        excuse -- to find Freebo, get back 
                        your money -- but you know he s dead.  
                        You know there s no money -- so you re

    He leans on the table again.  It rocks again.  Dexter notes 
    it again.

                                        GEORGE KING
                        You are lying -- you know where he is.

                        He wanted me dead.  So he used you.  
                        Played on your obsession.  Wasn t that 
                        hard.  I mean, you are a little single-
                        minded --

    King pushes away from the table abruptly. 

                                        GEORGE KING
                        I hope you re this talkative once I 
                        get my tools. 

    King ascends to the catwalk and goes to his toolbox to pick 
    out a knife.  Dexter starts rocking the table from side to 
    side.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)

    He positions his hand along the side of the table, and 
    starts rocking it more dramatically.

                        No...

    And with one big thrust, the table TIPS ON ITS SIDE -- BAM! 
    It CRUSHES Dexter s hand!  

    He strains in agony, and immediately starts pulling his 
    limp, shattered hand through the knotted loop of rope, 
    freeing it just as --

    George King comes at him, knife in hand, lunges -- 

    Dexter dodges, manages to KICK King away, long enough to use 
    his good hand to pull the rest of the rope free.  

    A fierce fight ensues.  King is fast and wiry, Dexter 
    bigger, but injured --  

    Dexter finally manages to wrap the rope around King s neck.  
    King begins to strangle, writhing and flailing with the 
    knife --  

    He NICKS Dexter s injured arm, but Dexter holds on, fighting 
    the searing pain in his hand --

    As Dexter struggles with King, he spots three cars bursting 
    into the far end of the cavernous warehouse.  Two cop cars - 
    light bars ablaze - and Debra s car just behind.

                                        DEXTER

    He redoubles his efforts and overpowers King.

                        -- Alive, you have too many answers --

    Wrapping his good arm around King s neck and coupling it 
    with his injured arm, Dexter deftly snaps King s neck.  
    Killing him.

    THE CARS SCREAM CLOSER.

    THINKING QUICKLY, DEXTER DRAGS KING S BODY TOWARD THE

    falls in front of his car -- GEORGE KING!  The car SLAMS

    Debra crosses to him, begins tying his tie for him.  They 
    notice their reflection in a nearby mirror, and smile at 
    each other.  Debra says to herself by rote...DEXTER 312   "Do You Take Dexter Morgan?"    Final Collated  10/23/08 50.

    She tightens the knot.  Perfection.

                        Thanks.  I was going to give it 
                        another eight tries before I gave up.

                                        DEBRA
                        Just remember.  Cody has the rings.  
                        And don t lock your knees when you re 
                        standing up there or you ll drop like 
                        a goddamn stone.

                        Wait, where are your vows?  

    Dexter taps his head. 

                                        DEXTER
                        In here. 

    She takes in her brother.  Overcome with emotion, Debra 
    pulls Dexter into a hug. 

                                        DEBRA
                        I am so happy for you.  I just wish 
                        Dad could be here.

    Through the open door, Dexter catches a glimpse in the 
    courtyard.  There s Harry, a proud smile and a wave. 

                                        DEXTER
                        I have a feeling he is.

                        Okay, enough of this sappy shit.

    Simple, pretty decor.  Nothing overly expensive or ornate, 
    just... warm, reflecting the bride s personality.  Dexter 
    and Rita stand at the altar.  Debra stands next to her 
    brother.  Astor and Cody next to Rita.  

    The gathered guests sit on white chairs:  Batista and 
    Gianna.  LaGuerta.  Quinn.  Anton.  Masuka and Tammy.  
    Ramos.  Soderquist.  Others from the precinct.  Syl.  Rita s 
    friends.  A few kids.DEXTER 312   "Do You Take Dexter Morgan?"    Final Collated  10/23/08 51.

    Rita has already placed the ring on his finger and is 
    finishing her vows.

                                        RITA
                        I honor you.  I love you... I marry 
                        you.

    Dexter s turn.  He takes a ring from Cody and slips it onto 
    Rita s finger.

                                        DEXTER
                        I promise... 
                              (a beat, thinking)
                        ... to be... the very best husband and 
                        father I can be.  Always.  

    It s pure truth.  And she can see that.  She smiles.  Tears 
    in her eyes.  And they kiss.  Deep and sure and true.

                          A completely, utterly honest vow.  

    They turn to the assembled, who rise as one and applaud. 

    ON DEXTER AND RITA.  Beaming.

    He and Rita step down from the altar and are surrounded by 
    their loved ones.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

    EXT. BEAUTIFUL OLD FLORIDA SEASIDE VENUE - LATER - DAY 53838

    THE RECEPTION.  Rita sits as Dexter removes her garter.  He 
    SLINGSHOTS it into the adoring crowd.

    MASUKA reflexively catches it.  He glances at Tammy.  Beat.  
    He tosses it to Batista.

    Rita FLINGS her bouquet over her shoulder.  

    DEBRA snags it mid-air.  Looks to Anton.  

    Debra crosses to the microphone.

                                        DEBRA
                        Hey everyone.  I am so fu..., uh so

                        dance as husband and wife... Mr. and 
                        Mrs. Dexter Morgan!

    The band plays  Tennessee Waltz  as Dexter leads Rita onto 
    the dance floor.  With his good hand, he takes her hand, 
    gingerly wrapping his broken hand around her waist.  They 
    begin to dance.  Slowly, magically, floating on the good 
    will of their friends and family.DEXTER 312   "Do You Take Dexter Morgan?"    Final Collated  10/23/08 52.

                        A new life, a new family...

    A SERIES OF DISSOLVES as:

    Dexter separates from Rita and takes Debra into his arms.  
    Rita goes to Astor and dances with her.

    Debra then moves to Anton and Rita goes to Cody.  Dexter 
    bows and asks LaGuerta to dance.  Smiling, she joins him.  
    On her way to being whole again.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Not that I can re-boot my life.  I m 
                        still... who I am.

    Other couples flow onto the dance floor.    

    Quinn passes out cigars from the box he had at the station. 

    Tammy argues with a waiter.  Masuka tries to calm her. 

    Dexter hands LaGuerta off to Quinn and finds his new wife.  
    Again putting his injured arm around her waist.  She 
    lovingly rests her head on his chest as they dance.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        But, today I m... more, than I ve ever 
                        dreamed.  Maybe tomorrow, as well. 

    He spreads his good hand, the one with the wedding ring, 
    across Rita s tummy.  Rita, moved, kisses him.

    The guests form a circle around Dexter and Rita.

    Dexter and Rita dance.

                        Who knows?  Maybe I can have it all.  
                        Because I have to say, right now...

    TIGHT ON DEXTER S CAST resting on Rita s back.  A tiny drop 
    of blood emerges from the edge of the cast.

                        ... life is good.

    Unseen, the blood-drop lingers for a moment, then falls onto 
    the back of Rita s pristine white dress.  Nothing will ever 
    be normal in Dexter s world.

    Dexter turns Rita and there s a slight smile of satisfaction 
    creasing his face as he looks into CAMERA.

                                                                    SMASH TO BLACK.
