Dark and in silhouette, Jimmy flips on the camera by remote.
It's too dark to see faces or bodies with any detail, but
Jimmy's clearly having sex with a PROSTITUTE in his bed. She
is young, black, and looks very much like a prostitute.
As he pounds into her...
JIMMY
Do you like that nigger?
Come on
nigger, do you like it?
PROSTITUTE
(humors him)
Oh yeah baby, I like it.
By remote, Jimmy shuts down the camera.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy's behind
the camera interviewing the Prostitute who
sits up in his
bed holding the sheets to cover herself. With
the lights on,
we can see that she's clearly unattractive.
Jimmy asks his
questions with a gentle confidence.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Okay, so. What was going through
your mind when I called you a
nigger?
PROSTITUTE
This costs you an extra fifty.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I know.
She pauses. You can tell she just wants to leave, but is
toughing it out for the extra fifty bucks.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Well, what did it feel like?
Long pause.
4.
PROSTITUTE
It felt like nothing.
JIMMY (O.C.)
What do you mean?
PROSTITUTE
You ain't the first person to call
me a nigger when we was fucking.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(not surprised)
Oh.
PROSTITUTE
Johns call me nigger all the time.
Especially white guys. Nothing
new. Just dirty talk.
Long, awkward pause.
Jimmy Doesn't know what to say.
PROSTITUTE
That it?
No reply from Jimmy.
PROSTITUTE
What about you? You like calling
me nigger? You get your nut off?
JIMMY (O.C.)
(calmly)
No.
PROSTITUTE
Then why'd ya call me that?
JIMMY (O.C.) (O.C.)
Have you ever wondered what it was
like to treat someone so completely
cruel that it was unthinkable?
No answer.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I was trying to do the unthinkable
and unimaginable when I called you
that. I wanted to see if was even
possible for me to do that.
They pause.
5.
PROSTITUTE
Yeah, so?
Jimmy speaks softly and confidently.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I think I want to die. Like I
don't deserve to live anymore.
And
that I will never want to do
something like that to someone
again.
The prostitute finds Jimmy's answer endearing.
PROSTITUTE
Why ya wanna die?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Because everyone hates me.
Pause.
JIMMY (O.C.)
They hate me because I seek beauty
and appreciate destruction. They
hate my mind, my thoughts, my
imagination. They hate everything
about me. And I hate them.
PROSTITUTE
(trying not to care)
Really?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Yep. Everyone. Everyone that
knows or who has ever met me.
PROSTITUTE
Your parents don't hate you. Look
at this room in this big 'ole house
you got.
JIMMY (O.C.)
My parents provide me with food and
shelter because they have been
conditioned by society into
thinking it's the appropriate thing
to do. In reality they can't stand
to be in the same room with me.
They're fascists, brainwashed, and
unforgiving.
(MORE)
6.
JIMMY (O.C.) (cont'd)
They dismiss my feelings of ill
regard towards them on simple
rebelliousness of youth, but that's
only because they are patently and
intentionally unaware of their own
hypocrisies.
Prostitute looks bored/frustrated again.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(accidental condescension)
Do you understand me?
PROSTITUTE
You wanna know what I think?
JIMMY
Yes, I really do.
PROSTITUTE
I think you're a spoiled ass white
boy, thinks you everything, but you
don't know shit. All you do is
bullshit complain and there's folks
out there that'd kill for all this.
Jimmy doesn't react.
PROSTITUTE
I don't feel sorry for you.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(calmly)
No one is asking you to.
Thank you
for letting me film you.
Camera turns off.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
Jimmy hides hidden camera style inside his car in the high
school parking lot, bleachers in the distance. School is
letting out as he zooms in on Judy.
She's looking at the ground as she's taunted by a group of
Other Harassing Teenagers, a tear streaming down the side of
her cheek.
Suddenly, Judy is bashed in the face with a school bag. She
falls to the ground, then picks up her broken glasses as
camera zooms out to catch the Girl who hit her (Mean Girl).
7.
Nearby, a big, Dumb Looking Bully Type (18) taunts her as she
cries. His taunts are biting and as excessive as the Mean
Girl's, then he dumps a cup of soda on Judy's head as she's
crying.
Judy screams at the top of her lungs. The group runs off
laughing. Jimmy whip pans to the Mean Girl as she laughs
with her friends, then whips pans back to Judy, now on her
feet, blood running from her nose and onto her white shirt.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. JUDY'S HOUSE - JUDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
A scene we've seen before. Jimmy is off camera videotaping
Judy through her bedroom window. We hear him FLOGGIN' THE
DOLPHIN off screen while Judy combs her hair in the mirror.
She stops when she hears...
A Grown Man, (45), walks into the doorway of her bedroom.
This is JUDY'S DAD. He comes in and doesn't say a thing to
her. Judy doesn't acknowledge him at all and continues
combing her hair as though he's not even there.
He comes up behind her, then wraps his arms around her,
giving her a warm hug from behind. Something's not right.
The masturbation sounds STOP.
Judy's noticeably uncomfortable but doesn't resist as her
Father begins kissing her neck. His hand slowly creeps down
to her pelvic area, his other hand turning out the bedroom
light. The room goes dark.
Camera flips down, then OFF...
Then COMES BACK ON AGAIN
Once again we're looking through the camera pointing at the
window, but now it's the distorted, grainy, black and white
of "Nite Shot" mode. Though we see the Judy's mirror and her
dresser, she and her Father are nowhere to be found.
Whatever's going on between them, it's going on out of frame,
away from the view of the window. Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
8.
Jimmy films once again, hidden camera style, long lens from
far away. Frame is close on Judy sitting at the dining room
table.
As camera pulls back, we HEAR but don't see Judy's Parents
talking to Jimmy's Mom and Dad at the table. Judy is bored,
completely uninterested in their conversation.
JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)
So Melissa talked Gary into the SL
instead of the seven series. I
couldn't believe it.
Judy looks over at camera, catching the fact that she's being
videotaped. Jimmy keeps filming.
JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
They paid way too much.
As Jimmy zooms in, she clandestinely flips off the camera.
JUDY'S DAD
I strictly buy American anyway.
Judy gets up.
Her mom stops her.
JUDY'S MOM (O.C.)
Where you going honey?
JUDY
Bathroom.
As Judy leaves the table she walks towards camera as it shuts
down.
CAMERA ON:
Judy sits on Jimmy's bed, staring into the camera.
She's
uncomfortable sitting there. It's poorly framed.
JUDY
Can we start already?
JIMMY (O.C.)
One second.
Camera shuts off.
9.
Jimmy films Judy again, better framing this time.
Judy looks
annoyed and uncomfortable in front of the camera.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Who do you hate most in the world
and why?
JUDY
(kind of bitchy)
Why? Who cares?
JIMMY (O.C.)
I do.
JUDY
God, I just wanted to come up here
to say "hi" and get away from my
parents' bullshit for like two
seconds and you have to put the
stupid camera in my face.
Jimmy takes delight in Judy's displeasure of being filmed.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Now we're onto something.
Judy wants to go and then doesn't.
JUDY
You're weird Jimmy. You were weird
when we were kids and now you're
just getting weirder.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Is that why you had a crush on me?
JUDY
(scoffs)
Yeah right.
JIMMY (O.C.)
You didn't have a crush on me?
Judy fidgets, he's got her.
JUDY
You're a loser. You're twenty one
and you're still living with your
parents.
She's waiting for a response.
Jimmy doesn't bite.
10.
JUDY
I heard that you got kicked out of
college because you tried to talk
your roommate into killing himself.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Where'd you hear that?
JUDY
From everyone.
Jimmy waits.
Judy's curious how he'll respond.
JIMMY (O.C.)
You wanna know the truth?
JUDY
Yeah.
JIMMY (O.C.)
He asked me if he should kill
himself. I told him to look inside
himself for the answer. I didn't
tell him to. I didn't tell him not
to. I said he shouldn't be afraid
of the unknown. If he was going to
kill himself, I wanted him to do it
for the right reasons.
JUDY
I swear to God, you're a fucking
psycho.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Like you're normal.
JUDY
More than you.
JIMMY (O.C.)
If I'm such a freak, what are you
doing in my room?
JUDY
I was bored.
Jimmy waits, assessing the situation.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I wanna show you something?
11.
Judy looks up at the camera.
Before she can answer, camera
shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
Judy sits on the edge of Jimmy's bed facing a television set.
Jimmy films from behind her so he gets Judy's back and the
television in the shot. The screen is static.
JUDY
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Nothing's happening.
Judy's getting antsy.
JUDY
(offended; turns to
camera)
Can you start the tape?
Jimmy clicks the VCR with his remote, as Judy turns back to
watch. On TV, static flips to black.
JUDY
Don't think this means I like you
or anything.
A few seconds.
Nothing on TV yet.
JUDY
And as soon as this is over I'm
going back downstairs.
An image flips on the TV.
BEGIN JIMMY'S REVENGE TAPE
The TV is off. All we see is Judy's back. She hasn't once
turned around to face the camera during any of the clips.
She sits still.
She trembles but doesn't turn around. She collects herself
but still doesn't turn around. Jimmy holds the camera
steady.
Still she doesn't turn around.
She fidgets in her seat but still doesn't turn around.
She now sits still on the edge of the bed like she is in a
trance, but still doesn't turn around to face the camera.
13.
No movement.
No movement.
No movement.
She begins to breath heavily.
Then no movement.
She leans her head down towards the floor.
Then no movement.
Still no movement or any reaction for that matter.
It's like
she is in a trance and can't wake up.
Jimmy (O.C.) continues to roll without budging.
Still no movement.
It looks like she's about to turn around. She moves her head
in the direction of the camera, then assumes her original
position facing the TV.
Then... no movement.
Still no movement.
Then Judy collapses onto the bed. Jimmy, still rolling, gets
off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor
crying hysterically.
Judy cries and cries and cries and cries. She then lets out
a cry from the depths of her soul. The cry is long, hard,
and loud.
Jimmy gets up, then stands above her with the camera.
She rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into
the camera. She tries to collect herself.
JUDY
Why did you do that?
JIMMY (O.C.)
I had to.
JUDY
Why?
JIMMY (O.C.)
I did it for you.
14.
JUDY
I don't understand.
Judy tries hard to stop, but just sobs harder and louder than
before.
JUDY
Please tell me.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I felt like if I didn't save you
then no one else would.
JUDY
(screams)
Please turn off the FUCKING CAMERA!
A muffled voice comes through the door from downstairs.
JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
Jimmy! What the hell are you guys
doing up there?
Judy stops, realizing suddenly that she's been screaming.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy's behind the camera. He stands at the head of the
stairs shooting down. Sounds of a dinner party just getting
started come from downstairs. He walks down the steps into
the party.
A generic "Happy Twentieth Anniversary" sign hangs above the
front door. Camera pans awkwardly to a lame K-Mart style
studio portrait on the wall. It's Jimmy's parents wearing
saccharine sweet smiles, Dad's hair slicked back, Mom in an
overdone hair-do and in way too colorful clothing.
Gifts sit on the entry-way table. Party Guests are dressed
nicely and are mingling in the house, drinks in hand. Dinner
is yet to start. As Jimmy moves into the...
ENTRY-WAY
People at the party all turn to camera, a look of shock on
their faces as Jimmy walks through.
More and more people react with gasps and revulsion at
camera, but we can't tell why. Jimmy moves camera to the...
15.
LIVING ROOM
The place is full of More Party Guests. Frame moves across a
huge mirror on the wall over a cocktail bar. We catch a
glimpse of Jimmy's image and realize...
Jimmy is completely NAKED and has PAINTED HIS ENTIRE BODY
SILVER.
Camera quickly turns away from the mirror as some people run
from the room.
One of the Female Party Guests (#1) SCREAMS.
FEMALE PARTY GUEST #1
(covers her mouth)
Oh my God!
Jimmy keeps filming, catching people's reactions.
He points the camera at a Female Party Guest #2.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Hey, great party, huh? I'm making
a tape for my parents. Want to say
something to them?
Female Party Guest #2 is just too stunned to speak.
JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)
Jimmy!
Jimmy turns the camera at his mother who is completely
shocked to see him like this.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Hey Mom. Happy anniversary. You
want to say anything to yourself?
JIMMY'S DAD
That's enough.
Jimmy's Dad runs into the room and throws a blanket over
Jimmy's head, body and the camera. All we see is black and
flashes of light from under the blanket.
JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
(muffled)
Get out! Now!
16.
Camera's under the blanket as we hear Jimmy's Dad pushes him
from the room. Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
Camera is being removed from the camera bag. As the lens
pans quickly, we catch a glimpse of Jimmy smirking, holding
the camera. He's way too close to the lens.
He flips it around until it locks on DR. WALTERS, MFCC (40),
Jimmy's not very accomplished therapist. Walters seems to
have a very gentle and nonthreatening aura that suggests he's
the type of person you would feel comfortable talking to. He
sits by the window in his relatively uninteresting office.
Jimmy has turned on the camera in the middle of their first
session together.
DR. WALTERS
Jimmy, we discussed this. You
can't tape our sessions. It's not
allowed.
The camera doesn't move.
DR. WALTERS
You know, you can't film someone
who doesn't want their image and
voice recorded. Technically,
you're actually breaking the law.
Jimmy (O.C.) doesn't respond.
DR. WALTERS
Does your defiance make you feel
more powerful?
Still no answer.
DR. WALTERS
Filming people makes you feel like
you're in control of the situation
doesn't it?
Still no answer.
DR. WALTERS
I can sit here as long as you can.
You're not going to be able to
force me to participate in your
little game here.
17.
No movement from the camera.
DR. WALTERS
Jimmy, this isn't something that
friends do to each other is it?
Dr. Walters sits in front of the camera, trying to stay
perfectly still and calm.
Dr. Walters is so nice and so calm, that we start to feel
sorry for him.
No movement.
No movement.
Dr. Walters fidgets.
Then holds still.
Then fidgets, trying to stay calm.
DR. WALTERS
Jimmy, put the camera away, please.
No movement.
DR. WALTERS
You're wasting your time and mine,
Jimmy. We could be doing something
productive.
The camera shakes a bit.
Jimmy's laughing.
Dr. Walters is doing his best to stay calm.
DR. WALTERS
That's enough.
No movement.
DR. WALTERS
Put it away.
Nothing.
DR. WALTERS
Now Jimmy!
Dr. Walters gets up and comes towards the camera.
He grabs
it just above the lens and tries to take it away.
18.
DR. WALTERS
Come on Jimmy.
A fierce battle of tug of war breaks out.
We see Dr. Walters
becoming increasingly pissed off.
The back and forth is suddenly getting violent, until...
DR. WALTERS
Gimme the Goddamn fucking camera!
Dr. Walters finally gets the camera free from Jimmy.
Camera
shuts off.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy's behind the camera, moving quickly down the hall to...
JIMMY'S BEDROOM
Judy is sitting on his bed.
She sees Jimmy come in with the
camera and freaks out.
JUDY
No. No filming.
I'm leaving, I
swear.
Judy gets up to go.
JIMMY
Okay, okay. Wait.
As Jimmy gets up to stop her, camera shuts off.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy is filming Judy, who is sitting on his bed. Her face
is red, her eyes have watered up, and her nose is snotty and
running from after an intense session of crying. Jimmy is
catching her seconds after she's has finally composed
herself.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Say what you said to me before.
JUDY
I don't know how I said it.
19.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Paraphrase it then.
JUDY
Do what?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Say it like you did before but it
doesn't have to be exactly the
same.
JUDY
You mean paraphrase it.
JIMMY (O.C.)
That's what I said.
JUDY
I didn't hear you.
Judy stares off camera.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Are you ready?
JUDY
I'm waiting for you.
JIMMY (O.C.)
OK.
JUDY
Tell me when.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Now.
JUDY
You want me to paraphrase it?
JIMMY (O.C.)
(impatient)
Yes!
Judy thinks for a beat.
JUDY
I can't remember what I said.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Then just ad-lib.
20.
JUDY
Ad-lib?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Yes.
Judy thinks for a beat.
JUDY
I don't know what that means.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(getting frustrated)
It means make it up.
JUDY
(confused)
Do you want me to make something up
or paraphrase what I did the first
time?
This isn't working.
The camera drops from Judy.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Let's take a break.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
Camera's on a tripod. Jimmy sits in a chair, the back of his
shoulder foregrounds Judy.
JUDY
I'm not good on camera.
It makes
me nervous.
JIMMY
Forget about the camera.
Talk to
me.
JUDY
OK.
JIMMY
Tell me what you said earlier.
About me about how you felt when
you saw the video.
21.
JUDY
(relaxes)
It felt like someone had been
reading my mind.
She stops.
JIMMY
Go on.
JUDY
It was like someone had jumped into
my head and watched what was being
projected.
Now Judy completely has forgotten that the camera is there.
JIMMY
And earlier, what you said about
God.
Jimmy zooms in the camera by remote.
Judy's distracted.
JIMMY
(off her look)
Tell me.
Judy refocuses.
JUDY
I said that it felt like God had
sent someone to protect me, and to
look out for me.
She looks at Jimmy as if he is an angel.
JUDY
And I said that you are the only
person in my life who has ever
looked after me like that.
Judy tries to stifle tears, but they're starting to flow
again. As camera zooms in further, Judy catches sight of
Jimmy's finger on the remote and BLOWS HER FUCKING TOP,
leaping from her chair.
JUDY
God, I hate it when you film me
crying!
Judy goes for the camera, struggling to get it off the
tripod, she finally frees it and points it at Jimmy.
22.
JUDY (O.C.)
How do you like it, huh? How do
you like having a camera shoved
right up your ass?
Camera's framed poorly, moves around a lot, goes in and out
of focus, etc.
JUDY (O.C.)
Do you like it? Do you?
JIMMY
I don't like it or dislike.
I'm
used to it.
Judy moves the camera directly in his face. The lens is
millimeters away from his nose. We see an extreme close up
of his nostrils.
JIMMY
Generally I'd place the camera
further away from my nose, but if
this is your preferred shooting
style then I guess I'll have to
adjust to it.
Jimmy leans in and rests his nose on the lens.
JIMMY
How's this work for you?
Judy pulls back and continues filming him.
JUDY (O.C.)
Give me a break.
JIMMY
OK.
Now Judy's the interviewer.
Her framing is not quite as
adept as Jimmy's.
JUDY (O.C.)
So... why do you have to film
everything?
JIMMY
I don't film everything.
JUDY (O.C.)
Why do you like to film me crying?
23.
JIMMY
I don't.
JUDY (O.C.)
Then why do you?
JIMMY
Because it's rare that I get to
find someone that lets their
emotions go. When a person is
crying, I mean truly crying, or
truly laughing or smiling or
frowning or gasping. For a few
seconds or minutes I get a chance
to see that person's soul. And
really, now that you've forced me
to think about it. I think it's a
very rare and beautiful thing to be
afforded that opportunity.
Judy is shaken and speechless.
JIMMY
Anything else?
Judy's moved and forgets herself.
Camera drops from Jimmy.
JUDY (O.C.)
Why me?
Jimmy helps her put the camera back up on him.
JIMMY
Because.
Jimmy sits still.
Judy doesn't know what to do with that.
JIMMY
Why do you think?
Judy doesn't have an answer.
Jimmy reaches forward and takes the camera away from her and
turns the interview around.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Why you and why me? Why are we
together right now?
Judy doesn't know what to say.
24.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Go ahead say it. I want you to.
I
know what you're going to say so
just say it.
JUDY
Stop.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(soft)
Tell me.
Judy fidgets.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(bullies her)
Tell me!
Judy fidgets again, then...
JUDY
(blows her top)
Because we're both fucking weird!
Judy pauses. The pressure of the camera from Jimmy makes her
feel like she has to give him more.
JUDY
Because we're the two weirdest kids
in the world. And God made us for
each other and I fucking love you,
and you did all this because you
love me too, and fuck everyone and
everything that doesn't get it!
Judy's out of breath.
Camera still points at her.
JUDY
That's right, right?
Judy stares back at the camera, longing for an answer from
Jimmy. She told him she loved him. Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. HIGHWAY FIRST-KISS-SMILEY-FACE/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
Jimmy is driving in his car with Judy in the passenger seat.
Judy has the camera and she is interviewing Jimmy as he
drives.
JUDY (O.C.)
Where are you taking me?
25.
JIMMY
To a beautiful place.
JUDY (O.C.)
Where?
JIMMY
Chuck E. Cheese.
Judy and Jimmy laugh together.
JUDY (O.C.)
No seriously.
JIMMY
I can't tell you.
It'll ruin it.
JUDY (O.C.)
Fine.
Judy sulks for a second.
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy, can I ask you something?
JIMMY
Anything.
JUDY (O.C.)
Do you hate your parents?
JIMMY
Yes, but I understand them.
JUDY (O.C.)
What's to understand?
JIMMY
Lots of things.
JUDY (O.C.)
Like what?
JIMMY
I understand that my ascension into
young adulthood triggered their
descent into mid-life crisis.
Generally when an only child leaves
the nest, the parents begin
reassessing their own lives. They
see us as a younger, better version
of themselves.
(MORE)
26.
JIMMY (cont'd)
They feel abandoned by our need for
privacy and insecure because we no
longer seek their approval. They
used to take us to baseball games
and cover our scrapes with
bandages, but once we no longer
need Mom to nurture our bruises or
Dad to be our hero it puts their
roles and subsequent sense of self
worth into question.
JUDY (O.C.)
How do you know all these things?
JIMMY
When you don't have any friends,
don't play sports, don't go out,
have no one talk to, nowhere to go,
no one to listen to you, or no one
to help you figure things out, you
sort of have to figure things out
by yourself. And without any of
those things I have nothing but
time to think about stuff.
JUDY (O.C.)
You are SO smart.
JIMMY
You are so beautiful.
Long pause.
Judy doesn't know how to react.
JUDY (O.C.)
You think I'm pretty?
JIMMY
I think you're the most beautiful
person I have ever met. The most
beautiful person in the universe.
JUDY (O.C.)
No one has ever told me that.
JIMMY
Get used to hearing it.
JUDY (O.C.)
Do you think I'm smart?
JIMMY
Yes.
27.
JUDY (O.C.)
Do you think I'm fat?
JIMMY
Yes.
JUDY (O.C.)
How could you say that? I only way
a hundred and ten pounds.
JIMMY
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said
flat. As in flat chested.
JUDY (O.C.)
I am not FLAT!
Judy smacks him.
JIMMY
Prove it.
JUDY (O.C.)
I don't have to prove it.
Here
look.
O.C., Judy is sticking her chest out for Jimmy. He looks
away from the road to stare, her breasts filling out her top
nicely.
JIMMY
I still can't tell.
JUDY (O.C.)
I wear a full B cup.
JIMMY
Show me.
Take em out.
JUDY (O.C.)
I am not going to take them out!
You take yours out.
JIMMY
It's already out.
Judy tilts the camera down.
IN A FLASH we see a lifelike dildo sticking out of Jimmy's
fly, a smiley face sticker covers the head. The camera
quickly shakes and spins off the image as Judy screams bloody
fucking murder.
28.
Jimmy laughs. Judy forgets the camera is on. She drops it
into her lap, fabric from her clothes covers the frame.
We can hear Jimmy and Judy laughing hysterically.
JUDY (O.C.)
I can't believe you did that.
JIMMY (O.C.)
That's why I did it. Now come on.
I showed you mine, let me see
yours.
We hear the rustling of Judy's clothing. Camera falls to her
feet on the floor of the car. There's silence. Off camera,
Judy's nervously showing Jimmy her breasts.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Wow.
Give me the camera.
JUDY (O.C.)
No.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Please, pretty, pretty please with
sugar on top.
Judy grabs the camera. It's pointing in Jimmy's direction,
but she still doesn't realize it's on.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Here, I'll pull over.
Jimmy pulls over to the side of the road then takes the
camera. Jimmy frames up Judy.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Let me see 'em.
Judy has a naughty and flirtatious smile.
In the blink of an eye she suddenly lifts up her shirt and
exposes her bra, then pulls her shirt back down.
Jimmy protests.
JIMMY (O.C.)
That doesn't count. Come on, for
real this time.
JUDY
I'm embarrassed.
29.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Don't be.
You can trust me.
Judy's not sure.
Jimmy looks into her eyes, pouring it on.
JIMMY (O.C.)
You can. You can trust me with
your life.
Judy looks at him with a sense of admiration then hope.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(gently)
Please.
Judy gets the same sexy, naughty smile and lifts up her shirt
exposing the bra, keeping it there.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Will you take off your bra?
Judy looks nervous but gives in. She unhooks her bra from
the front and exposes her naked breasts for as long as she
can. Jimmy focusses the camera's attention on them. It's
too much for her. She quickly pulls her shirt back down.
Jimmy tilts up to a close up of Judy's face.
JUDY
(struggling)
I just realized something.
Judy's eyes are starting to well up as she tries not to cry.
JIMMY (O.C.)
What's the matter?
JUDY
I just showed you my breasts and I
saw your penis and we haven't even
kissed.
She starts tearing up.
JUDY
You haven't even asked me to be
your girlfriend and I did that.
I'm a slut.
(wiping her eyes)
I don't want to be a slut.
Jimmy sees she's crying.
30.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Will you be my girlfriend?
JUDY
Yes.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Can I kiss you?
JUDY
(sniffling)
Yes. Will you turn off the camera?
JIMMY (O.C.)
I want this moment to be captured
forever. I'd rather not kiss you
at all than waste the opportunity
to document the most beautiful
moment of my life.
Judy leans towards Jimmy, then suddenly attacks him and
shoves the camera to the side. They are making out
exuberantly. The camera shakes and wobbles. We can hear
heavy breathing and the two of them smashing up against the
interior of the car.
Jimmy finally has the camera in position. He has one of his
arms extended and now we can see the two of them kissing.
Judy's devouring him in that raging teenage hormone sort of
way.
JUDY
(whispers)
I wanna see your smiley face again.
We see and hear Judy whispering, her lips placed gently on
the inside of Jimmy's ear.
JUDY
(whispering)
Turn the camera off. Turn the
camera off. Turn it off.
Camera goes off.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. HIGHWAY FIRST-KISS-SMILEY-FACE/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
Judy films Jimmy driving the car.
He has a huge shit eating
grin on his face.
31.
JUDY (O.C.)
How do you feel?
JIMMY
Relaxed, happy, confident, studly,
excited, relieved, delighted... I
love you Judy.
JUDY (O.C.)
You do?
JIMMY
Very much so. I always have.
JUDY (O.C.)
Me too.
Long pause filled with sexual tension takes over.
JUDY (O.C.)
Do you want to pull over again?
Jimmy smiles.
Of course he does.
Camera goes off.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy is standing in front of a mirror and is videotaping his
own reflection.
He is talking to himself and into the camera.
JIMMY
Don't fuck this up.
Please don't
fuck this up.
Now he is pleading with himself.
JIMMY
Just try to be normal.
(screaming)
Just be normal! God damn it why do
you have to fuck everything up?
He hasn't convinced himself.
JIMMY
Be normal.
Be normal.
Be normal!
Jimmy takes a breath, then shuts the camera down.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy films Judy who lies next to him in the bed. Her face
is sweaty and red and he is still a tad out of breath. Jimmy
is capturing her literally seconds after they had sex.
She's somewhat bewildered, then she notices the camera.
She's starting to get used to it.
JUDY
(big smile)
Hi.
33.
JIMMY (O.C.)
So how do you feel now, right at
this moment?
Judy just sighs, basking in the afterglow.
JUDY
I don't know.
(trying)
That was soooo good.
JIMMY (O.C.)
You were good. What got into you?
JUDY
I don't know. I've just really
been wanting you lately. Really
bad.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Why's that?
Judy chuckles.
JUDY
I'm embarrassed.
I can't say.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Now you have to tell me.
JUDY
It was after yesterday.
Jimmy is more than surprised.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Yesterday?
Judy speaks as if she is going to reveal a big secret.
Very
quiet and cute in her mannerisms.
JUDY
Yeah, it was after I saw you shoot
that gun.
JIMMY (O.C.)
You were crying. I wanted to kill
myself after I did that. You were
scared and you were shaking. It
was the most awful thing I ever
did. I didn't think I'd ever see
you again.
34.
Judy thinks.
JUDY
I was scared at first. Really
scared. I didn't expect it to be
so loud and you looked so mean.
But then I got home and started
thinking about it. About how your
muscles looked and how dangerous it
all seemed. It made me like... all
excited, and like...
Judy looks for the right word.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Horny?
Judy laughs with embarrassment.
Camera shakes as Jimmy hands
it to her.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Here.
Hold this.
Judy turns the camera back on Jimmy as he leaps out of bed.
JUDY (O.C.)
Where you going?
JIMMY
One sec!
Jimmy's bare ass flashes us as he heads out the bedroom door.
Judy holds the camera as we hear Jimmy in the hallway. He
opens a closet door, fumbles through it, then busts back into
the bedroom, holding the shotgun he used out on the lake.
Jimmy zooms in on Jimmy's naked upper body as he stands in
front of her and begins pumping the gun and pulling the
trigger. Obviously the gun is not loaded.
JUDY (O.C.)
That is so hot!
JIMMY
My dad keeps it in his closet.
Here.
Jimmy gives Judy the gun.
Now she's holding the gun and the
camera.
JUDY (O.C.)
It's heavy.
35.
Judy points the gun at Jimmy.
She lowers it, aiming right at
his crotch just below frame.
JIMMY
Now I see the appeal.
Give me the
camera.
Judy hands Jimmy the camera.
Camera moves and shakes as she
hands it over.
Jimmy frames her up nicely. Now we see Judy topless,
pointing the gun directly at the lens of the camera.
JUDY
What do you think of this?
She brings the gun down, then takes the barrel of the gun and
places it between her breasts, squishing them together,
covering her nipples as she rubs the barrel between her
breasts.
JUDY
Do you like that?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Yes.
Judy takes the barrel of the gun from her breasts and near
her mouth. She starts rolling her tongue over the top of the
barrel slowly and seductively, then stops. It looks as if
she's about to perform full mock oral sex on the barrel of
the gun.
JIMMY (O.C.)
That is SO hot.
As she is about to start to move her mouth and lips over the
gun, then suddenly we hear a garage door open.
Jimmy throws the camera sideways down on the bed.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Fuck!
It's my parents!
We are now seeing sideways rotated images of Jimmy and Judy
panicking, throwing on their clothes as fast as humanly
possible.
Jimmy grabs the camera off the bed and turns it off.
CAMERA ON:
36.
Jimmy is hiding in the closet of his parents' bedroom. He
has the door of the closet cracked and puts the lens of the
camera through the crack.
Jimmy's Dad enters the room. He has no idea that he is being
filmed and that Jimmy is in the closet.
Jimmy's Dad walks over to the dresser, opens up the top
drawer and pulls something out. It's too dark in the room to
tell exactly what he's pulled out, but it appears to resemble
some sort of undergarment.
Jimmy's Dad begins undressing, then steps out of frame.
After a beat, he reappears. Now he's wearing nothing but a
sequined teddy. He's totally fat, hairy, and nasty looking.
He sits on the side of the bed, his back to us. Now we see
that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair of
fishnet stockings. He begins putting them on.
When he is finished putting on his panty hose, he gets up off
the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror. He begins
to gently stroke the sides of his legs, relishing the feel of
the hose over his hands and fingertips.
He seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to
get all worked up. He shakes his hips and dances around the
room for a few seconds.
Now Jimmy's Dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long
brunette wig from the back of his top drawer. Putting it on,
with the fishnet stockings, sequined teddy and long wig, he
has transformed himself into the world's fattest, ugliest,
hairiest, Cher look-a-like.
Someone else enters the room.
JIMMY'S DAD
Hi sweety.
Holy shit. It's Jimmy's Mom, and she's wearing a leather
dominatrix outfit!
JIMMY'S MOM
Are you ready for me, you fucking
slut?
JIMMY'S DAD
Not quite.
37.
JIMMY'S MOM
I don't feel like waiting. Hurry
up bitch. What do you have left to
do?
JIMMY'S DAD
I just need to put on my makeup.
As Jimmy's Mom exits frame, we see Jimmy's Dad go to the
mirror. He opens up the top drawer again and pulls out a
little makeup bag.
Jimmy's Mom re-enters, now wearing a mini leather biker's
hat, carrying a riding switch.
JIMMY'S MOM
Come on slut.
Jimmy's Dad finishes applying his lipstick and moves over to
the bed. By the way Jimmy's parents are behaving, it's as if
they've gone through this routine a thousand times.
Jimmy's Mom drifts off screen as Jimmy's Dad gets up on all
fours. Suddenly, we hear a SMACK as Jimmy's Mom hits Jimmy's
Dad on his ass with the switch.
He lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues SMACKING
him with the whip harder and harder. He yelps, squeals, and
gyrates his hips back and forth, then starts dry humping the
air until she stops.
Jimmy's Mom comes back through and out of frame. Jimmy's Dad
pushes his belly into the bed, groaning from the pain while
he waits for her return.
She comes back, moving quickly across the screen wearing an
enormous strap on dildo.
Disappearing out of frame again, Jimmy's Dad gets himself
ready for her one more time, ass up, on all fours on the bed.
From behind, we can see her hand as she hikes her husband's
dress up his back, then we see his face and hear him grunt as
she rips his fishnets off screen.
There's a pause. Nothing seems to be happening, but Jimmy's
Dad is bracing himself for something. His face tightens up.
Off screen, Jimmy's Mom has started mounting him from behind.
Jimmy can't take it any longer. As he slowly emerges from
the closet, his Mom notices Jimmy almost immediately. She
jumps off her husband, screaming bloody murder.
38.
Camera's shaky but it's easy to guess what's been happening.
Mom's just started doing Dad from behind with the strap on.
JIMMY
Hi mom.
Hi dad.
What are you guys
up to?
Jimmy's Dad leaps from the bed and begins shouting. He looks
completely absurd screaming at Jimmy wearing his sequined
dress and wig.
JIMMY'S DAD
What the fuck are you doing here?
Jimmy's Mom goes hysterical and begins screaming at Jimmy's
Dad.
JIMMY'S MOM
(to his dad)
I told you he would find out you
fucking freak! No wonder he's a
fucking psycho. Look a his father.
Jimmy's Dad is beside himself with fury and throws off his
wig.
JIMMY'S DAD
Turn off the that fucking camera!
Turn off that fucking camera right
fucking now god damn it!
Jimmy is loving it.
JIMMY
Gee dad, what do you say the two of
us go out to the front yard and
throw some ball together? We'll
have a nice friendly game of catch.
Jimmy's Dad attacks Jimmy. He swings at the lens. He's one
angry drag queen daddy. He begins strangling Jimmy.
JIMMY'S DAD
You little mother fucker.
Turn off
that fucking camera!
Jimmy's Mom rips off her strap on dildo and begins beating
Jimmy's Dad with it.
Judging from the punishment she's inflicting upon her drag
queen husband, the dildo apparently is made from the finest
and heaviest of materials.
39.
JIMMY'S MOM
Stop it!
You're going to kill him.
Jimmy's Dad lets go.
The dildo's doing the trick.
JIMMY'S DAD
Bitch!
Jimmy's Mom keeps swinging the dildo at Jimmy's Dad even
though he's let go.
JIMMY'S MOM
Fuck you! You think you know me?
You don't know me! You piece of
shit!
JIMMY
(laughing)
Mom!
Jimmy's Mom now directs her attention on Jimmy. She screams
at him as she swings her gigantic strap on towards the
camera.
JIMMY'S MOM
You little beast! You want to film
something? Film this!
She continues to swing the strap on as she walks closer and
closer to the lens.
The camera goes crazy. Loud sounds are heard throughout the
room. Evidently Jimmy has been tackled. We hear wrestling
and grunting. It seems that Jimmy's Dad has tackled Jimmy,
or maybe his Mom, or both, but the camera is too shaky to
tell just what has happened.
Jimmy's Dad is still fighting. He seems to have them all
pinned against the floor. He's crushing his mother.
JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
Nancy, Nancy, Nancy, Nancy! Please
someone call me Nancy. My name is
Nancy.
JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)
(crying hysterically)
Nancy, Nancy, Nancy... Jimmy
please call him "Nancy" for the
love of God. Call your daddy
Nancy. Call him Nancy...!
40.
We hear Jimmy's Mom screaming/repeating herself. We see a
hand go over the lens. Jimmy and his mother and father are
all in a wrestling match on the floor.
Jimmy with great enthusiasm begins to sing as the camera
shakes.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Take me out to the ball game, take
me out to the crowd, buy me some
peanuts and crackerjacks...
The wrestling match continues as we see more hands come
towards the lens. Jimmy's Mom suddenly stops screaming, as
if she's been knocked out.
JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
Give me that fucking tape!
JIMMY (O.C.)
I don't think so Nancy.
Nancy,
Nancy, Nancy...
After some very intense fighting, someone is finally able to
shut the camera off.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy is in a grocery store aisle filming Judy from way far
away. We can barely make out that it is her until Jimmy
zooms in tighter. She couldn't look more nervous or obvious.
She is in the beer section. She quickly takes a six pack of
canned beer and struggles to put it in her school bag. She
walks quickly towards the exit. Jimmy follows her and
catches up.
Jimmy is standing next to her and he continues to film.
Judy
looks so nervous.
JUDY
Jimmy, turn it off.
We're gonna
get busted.
JIMMY (O.C.)
No way, this is the best part.
A man is yelling at them off camera.
MAN (O.C.)
Hey you two. Stop.
48.
Jimmy pans over and a store manager is standing in front of
them.
STORE MANAGER
What the hell do you think you're
doing?
Jimmy and Judy have no reply.
The store manager gives them
his best intimidating stare.
There is an extremely long pause.
STORE MANAGER
Turn that damn thing off. You
can't be running around the store
playing with a camera. It's
against the store policy. Now get
out of here.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
We see and hear a huge roaring fire. Jimmy has zoomed the
lens in so close that we can't tell what it is that's
burning.
As he pulls out, it's revealed that the dead homeless guy is
roasting in the fire.
JUDY (O.C.)
(coughing)
Oh, my god. The hair burning is
making me nauseous.
Judy coughs more violently before.
69.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Yeah, God damn. Burning bodies
fucking stinks. That bum's body
odor is being cooked right off him.
Jimmy pokes the flaming skull with his stick.
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy!
Jimmy pokes some more at the body, then flips the camera up
at Judy.
JUDY
What?
I'm not in the mood.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(making light)
Don't have to be in the mood.
Doesn't matter. The camera's on,
it's on.
(changes the subject)
You wanna know where we're gonna
go?
JUDY
Okay, where are we gonna go?
JIMMY (O.C.)
We're going to Lincoln to visit
Dinko.
JUDY
Who's Dinko, Jimmy?
JIMMY (O.C.)
He's cool. And he's got his own
place, and he said I could stay
there whenever ever I wanted. Plus
he knows about you and he wants to
meet you. And he doesn't like
cops, so he's not gonna call 'em.
Okay? Now gimme a smile.
JUDY
No.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Gimme a smile, and I'll let you see
my smiley face again.
Judy begins coughing.
70.
JUDY
I can't get sexy with that smell.
I just can't.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
Music is playing extremely loud in a funky ass trailer as
Judy dances with DINKO (late 20s) a completely drunk trailer
trash dude wearing a pizza delivery outfit.
Empty whiskey and beer bottles are scattered throughout the
tiny living room as cigarette smoke hovers around them due to
a ridiculously low ceiling.
Judy is dancing in a very sexy manner with Dinko who is
dancing like a complete dork. Dinko has no moves, rhythm, or
beat whatsoever, but dances with as much vigor as a dog on
crack.
Jimmy is sitting on the couch filming them dancing in front
of him. Dinko is forced to scream over top of the music to
be heard. He looks directly at Jimmy noticing that Jimmy's
turned on the camera.
DINKO
Hey! The video-man. I remember
that shit when we was in together.
Said you video-ed everything.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Yep.
DINKO
Hey man, it's cool if you guys stay
here for a while, but I have a
small business to run man. There's
going to be some people knocking on
the door and shit. I can't have
you guys answering the door or the
phone. That's the only rule.
Other than that man, we're going to
getting fucked up together all the
time. I got a shit load of crank
dude, that shit is off the fucking
hook. Here, take a hit.
Dinko tries to hand off some crank to Jimmy.
71.
JIMMY (O.C.)
No thanks, I just want to film Judy
dancing.
Jimmy pans the camera over towards Judy.
She's doing her
best sexy dance into the camera.
We can still hear Dinko talking to Jimmy.
DINKO (O.C.)
Right man. That's cool. Hey um...
If I tell you to stop taping
though, man, you gotta stop. I got
some hard core junkies coming over
here. Sometimes, if they see shit
like that, they fucking flip.
Crank junkies are a whole different
kind of breed man. They're fucking
hard core mother fuckers. You
don't know what they're gonna
fucking do. This one guy got
paranoid about something. He used
to climb on his roof to take a
dump. That's the only place he
would shit! How fucked up is that?
Dinko laughs at his own joke.
JUDY
You're not even paying attention to
me Jimmy.
Judy takes her dancing up a notch to get Jimmy's attention.
JUDY
Don't I look sexy?
Jimmy doesn't get a chance to respond.
DINKO (O.C.)
Yeah, you look real sexy baby.
Real nice.
Dinko starts in with Jimmy again.
DINKO (O.C.)
Hey, I may have some work for you
if you're cool with that.
Jimmy turns the camera back to Dinko while he goes to the
kitchen to get a beer.
72.
JIMMY (O.C.)
What kind of work?
DINKO
You know some hustling, some good
money. I'll teach you how to mix
the shit. Your girlfriend too if
she wants.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(sarcasm)
Yeah. That's what I've always
wanted to do. Learn to make and
sell crystal methamphetamine.
You're a fucking genius Dinko.
Dinko is too stupid to recognize sarcasm.
DINKO
(big smile)
Yeah, man! Fuckin' high five.
Dinko high five's Jimmy and laughs again.
DINKO
(re: Judy)
So is she, like, your girlfriend or
are you guys just fucking?
JIMMY (O.C.)
She's my girlfriend, my best
friend, and yes we fuck. And don't
ever, ever fucking touch her.
That's MY only rule Dinko.
Judy is frustrated with Jimmy's lack of attention.
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy!
Jimmy turns the camera to her. She's starting to do her best
impression of a stripper dance.
DINKO
It's all good man. I ain't gonna
touch your old lady. Shit man,
she's so into you anyway.
Dinko gets up and moves into the kitchen area, crossing the
frame. Jimmy focusses the camera's attention on various
items in the kitchen while Dinko talks.
73.
There's ripped open small electronics and appliances
everywhere, as if Dinko's been taking everything apart and
trying to put it back together.
DINKO
So there's this dude. Fucker
taught me everything I know about
meth and shit. He'd fucking flip
for your girl, man. You should go
up and see him. He's in Erlanger.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Uncle Rodney?
Camera drifts across several messy piles of papers and
cardboard boxes with bags of drugs in them.
DINKO (O.C.)
Right, right! I forgot.
Yeah,
Uncle Rodney!
JUDY (O.C.)
You have an Uncle Rodney baby?
Judy is too stoned to realize that Jimmy has already told her
about Uncle Rodney.
Jimmy pulls out to include Judy in the shot. She's in the
kitchen doing another line of crank off a counter top.
JUDY
I want to meet your uncle.
JIMMY (O.C.)
He's not my uncle. He's not
anybody's uncle. People just call
him that. He's the one I told you
about from the nut house.
As Judy bends down to snort her line, camera drifts over to
Dinko who's holding a HUGE HILLBILLY WAD OF CASH in his hand
and stuffs it into a box of cereal. Jimmy zooms in on the
cereal box. There's a whole bunch more cash in there.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I said one day I'd take you up to
Erlanger one day, remember?
JUDY (O.C.)
When was that?
Dinko throws the cash on the table.
Jimmy ZOOMS OUT catching
Judy in the frame.
74.
JIMMY (O.C.)
When we were naked.
JUDY
We're always naked, Jimmy.
Judy wipes powder from her nose, then goes foggy for a split
second, losing then catching her balance.
JUDY
(re: crank)
Fuck... Woah, that's cool.
DINKO (O.C.)
That's some good shit, huh?
JUDY
(disoriented)
Uh huh...
Jimmy turns the camera onto Dinko.
DINKO
So you guys should like, totally go
see him, man. I don't fuckin' go
up there no more, 'cuz like, I got
all the shit I need right here man,
'cuz my place is cool and all, but
there's no fucking room here, ya
know? So like you should go see
him and shit.
Judy steps into frame. At this point, she's in her bra and
is dancing like a stripper directly in front of the camera.
JUDY
You like this, Jimmy?
THERE'S A KNOCK at the door.
DINKO (O.C.)
(calls out to door)
Yo!
(to Jimmy)
Customers call.
Judy keeps on dancing in her own little world while Dinko
goes to the door. Judy finishes her bottle of beer. She's
pretty drunk and cranked out at this point.
75.
Dinko is at the front door dealing with a customer. We can't
see her and we can barely hear what they're talking about,
but it seems Dinko is engaged in a heated conversation with
her. He yells back into the living room from the front door.
DINKO (O.C.)
Yo, Jimmy.
Is your girl into
chicks?
JIMMY (O.C.)
I don't know.
(to Judy)
Are you into chicks?
JUDY
Do you want me to be into chicks?
JIMMY (O.C.)
(calls to her)
Sure Dinko. Bring her in.
Dinko brings in HAZEL,(40), a frightfully thin crank addict.
She's scared, nervous, and completely strung out, and she
looks like death. They stand off to the side of the room
watching Judy dance.
Judy realizes the woman is in the room and stops dancing.
Jimmy zooms in on the woman. Looking closer we see that
Hazel is in the final stages of her life/addiction. She's
sweating and her eyes are bugging out of her skull.
Dinko turns the music down so they don't have to scream.
JIMMY (O.C.)
You know what, never mind Dink.
I
don't think Judy's into chicks.
JUDY
Yeah, I'm not into chicks.
DINKO
Well Hazel here will do anything we
want. Ain't that right Hazel?
Hazel nods her head yes.
DINKO
You're into chicks aren't you
Hazel?
76.
HAZEL
Um, I really just want to get some
stuff and get out of here.
Hazel is trembling.
The party atmosphere has come to a
complete halt.
DINKO
Shut up you fat fucking junkie and
take your clothes off or you ain't
getting shit.
Hazel's not moving.
She's reluctant.
DINKO
Come on!
HAZEL
I don't...
Dinko smacks her square in the face.
DINKO
(screaming)
Just do it, you fucking whore!
Hazel starts to take her clothes off reluctantly.
JUDY
Jimmy.
Jimmy doesn't do anything.
He just keeps filming.
JUDY
Jimmy, stop him!
JIMMY (O.C.)
He's a big boy, he can do what he
wants.
This gives Dinko an added boost of confidence. Hazel is now
in her bra and panties and is standing in front of them.
DINKO
Ever made a porno?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Not with you.
77.
DINKO
Well all right! Keep filming
mother fucker, I'm gonna fuck this
junkie for you. You guys are free
to join in whenever you like.
Judy is now borderline hysterical.
JUDY
I swear to God Jimmy if you let him
go through with this I'll never
talk to you again!
Jimmy ignores her.
DINKO
You ready?
You filming?
JIMMY (O.C.)
I'm filming. Are you going to fuck
her or are you just gonna talk
about it?
JUDY
(screaming)
Jimmy!
Dinko unbuckles his belt as fast as he can. Hazel begins to
cry as Dinko pushes her into position on all fours.
DINKO
(to Jimmy)
How's this? You getting good
camera angles and shit?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Turn her ass towards the camera.
DINKO
(laughing it up)
Take off them panties bitch...
Oh
yeah! Come on bitch. Move.
Judy is crying profusely in the background as Dinko pushes
Hazel to the ground. Jimmy zooms in on Dinko, framing out
Hazel as Dinko gets himself ready to take her from behind.
DINKO
That's it.
Just like that.
Dinko looks directly at the lens of the camera.
78.
DINKO
We're going to be doing this shit
all the time brother.
JIMMY (O.C.)
You think so?
DINKO
Fuck yeah!
Dinko sees something O.C. from Jimmy, we can't see that
surprises him.
DINKO
You don't have to hold a gun to her
head man. There's plenty of other
chicks we can do that to. If
that's what you're into, then fuck
it, I'll...
BAM!!!
Dinko takes a shot in the throat and falls onto Hazel.
Jimmy's shot him.
Judy has stopped screaming. Hazel on the other hand is
freaking out, trapped under a squirming Dinko.
Jimmy sets the camera on top of something, stands up and
brings the gun to Judy.
JIMMY
Take it!
Judy doesn't know what to do.
Jimmy puts the gun in her
hand.
JIMMY
Finish him off! He deserves a
bullet right in the fucking face,
doesn't he?
Judy's in a weird cranked out place.
JUDY
(nervous, cranked out)
Yeah. Yeah. He does.
JIMMY
Then do it.
Judy points the gun at a still squirming Dinko.
She can't
bring herself to pull the trigger.
79.
We can hear Dinko choking on his own blood.
He struggles to
move towards Judy.
Jimmy's now standing behind Judy. He wraps his hand around
hers, helps her point the gun and...
BAM
Shoots Dinko right between the eyes.
Jimmy helps her again.
BAM-BAM
Two more shots into his chest, Jimmy's hand still wrapped
around Judy's over the gun.
Jimmy lets go of her hand and the gun drops to the floor.
She's stunned.
Jimmy comes towards camera and shuts it down.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. ROAD LEAVING TRAILER/DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT
A rip roaring fire burns from the trailer. Jimmy is shooting
out of the back of the Dinko's Car, a beat up old station
wagon, as they drive away down the gravel road.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Good bye Dinko, mother fucker.
Thanks for letting us borrow your
car, and for the cash.
JUDY (O.C.)
And for the crank!
Jimmy sits back into his seat and turns the camera on Judy.
She's got a big smile on her face.
JIMMY (O.C.)
You feeling good baby?
JUDY
I feel calm. I don't care about
anything.
Jimmy keeps filming.
JUDY
What are we going to do with the
car Jimmy?
80.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Ditch it.
JUDY
The crank?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Snort it.
Give some of it away.
JUDY
The cash.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Vacation baby. Anywhere we want to
go.
Judy smiles. She turns and blows a kiss towards the camera,
oddly serene from the drugs despite everything that's
happened. To her, it's as if all is right with the world.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy is standing on the altar waiting for his bride to be.
He is wearing a white tuxedo with black tie and ruffle shirt
like Ricardo Montalban from Fantasy Island.
They are being married by an Elvis impersonator and the
witnesses/groomsmen are Siegfried and Roy look-a-likes.
Jimmy waves to the person who is working the camera.
The
Elvis impersonator talks to Jimmy.
ELVIS
You know the video's gonna cost you
twenty extra, right?
JIMMY
Yeah.
ELVIS
Well alright then.
Let's get this
sum bitch started!
Elvis reaches down and gets a guitar and breaks into an Elvis
version of "Here Comes the Bride" but to the song "You ain't
Nothing But A Hound Dog."
81.
ELVIS
Weeeeeelllll, you ain't nothing but
a young bride... walking down the
aisle.
The Elvis impersonator goes all out with the dance and the
gyrating Elvis hips as he jams on his acoustic guitar.
Jimmy motions to the camera to turn around.
JIMMY
Here she comes.
ELVIS (O.C.)
You ain't nothing but a young
bride... walking down the aisle.
The camera whips around and we see Judy walking down the
aisle. Tears of joy run down Judy's heavily made up face as
she walks.
ELVIS
Well, if you don't marry Jimmy,
then you ain't no friend of mine.
Judy makes her way over to her side of the altar next to her
bridesmaids (two Cher look-a-likes).
ELVIS
Do you...
Elvis is looking for Judy's name that's been scribbled on
paper.
JIMMY
(helping)
Judy. And here, we wrote our own
vows.
He hands Elvis a small piece of paper who skims it. He kind
of shakes his head, smirking at what he reads, then decides
to go for it.
Elvis gives a quick windmill strum to his guitar and starts.
ELVIS
Do you Judy promise to always
swallow, to never cut your hair, or
have another man's penis injected
into any part of your body for as
long as you both shall live?
The Cher bridesmaids giggle.
82.
JUDY
I do.
ELVIS
Do you Jimmy promise to always fuck
Judy with enthusiasm, to take a
shower once a day, and promise not
to inject your penis into any part
of another person's body as long as
you both shall live?
JIMMY
I do.
ELVIS
Can I get the rings?
Siegfried gives the rings to Jimmy who places one on Judy's
finger and vice versa.
ELVIS
With the power vested in me by the
great state of Nevada... I do
herby pronounce you husband and
wife. You may kiss the bride.
Jimmy and Judy grab each other by the ass and begin making
out.
The freak show audience claps while they are making out. The
applauding dies down but Jimmy and Judy continue to make out.
Jimmy puts his hand up her dress as she begins unbuckling his
pants. It looks like they may start fucking on the alter.
Elvis jumps in to break it up.
ELVIS
All right you two.
We got a
schedule to keep.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy is running through
the motel room with the camera.
Flashes of snorted lines
of crank dust and rolled up bills
are in the background as
Jimmy moves through the room. We
hear Judy screaming with
excitement about something on the
TV.
83.
JUDY (O.C.)
Hurry up Jimmy, hurry, hurry,
hurry, shit Jimmy. You're going to
miss it.
Jimmy settles camera on the television.
BEGIN TV NEWS REPORT
On TV, Jimmy and Judy's high school year book pictures are on
the screen.
An ANCHORMAN is mid-sentence, talking about Jimmy and Judy.
ANCHORMAN
...press conference in a few
moments. The suspect's names are
James Wright and Judy Elizabeth
Oaks-Kellen...
JUDY (O.C.)
No it's not! I'm Judy Wright now!
(sing songy, like a little
girl)
I'm Judy Wright now!
JIMMY (O.C.)
Shhhh...
Shut up!
ANCHORMAN
...from Burlington, Kentucky are
wanted for questioning in the
alleged murder of a Hamilton County
Sheriff's Deputy that was killed
two nights ago while on Patrol in
the Over the Rhine section of
Cincinnati. On a very serious
note, the producers here at KPX-TV
4 would like to warn you that the
images we are about to show are
violent and graphic in nature and
may not be suitable for young
children. Once again, these are
the images that were taken from a
video camera that was mounted on
board the patrol car. Viewer
discretion is advised.
Judy gasps involuntarily as...
84.
Jimmy pulls the camera from the screen and points it at Judy
to get her reaction. Her eyes are locked on the screen.
Judy's face drops. We, on the other hand, are dying to see
what she's looking at.
Jimmy swish pans back to the TV and zooms in tight.
The
television fills the frame.
The Anchorman speaks to camera as...
Jimmy pans up to Judy, hoping to record a reaction. She's
locked on the TV, her hand over her mouth, frozen, not
knowing how to react.
She turns and looks up at him.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I didn't want us to be apart.
86.
Judy's starting to tear up. She's emotional, conflicted.
She can't believe he did that for her, but she's also just
come to the sober realization that he killed a cop in cold
blood for her.
JIMMY (O.C.)
They know who we are now.
(making light)
Actually, we're famous now.
Judy kind of half smiles. She hadn't thought of it, but
she's still trying to digest the images until...
JUDY
That's the most romantic thing I've
ever even heard of.
A voice catches Judy's attention from the TV. It's an
ATTORNEY type at a press conference being held by Jimmy's
parents.
ATTORNEY (O.C.)
(on TV)
...have a few words and then we'll
be taking questions.
Judy looks back at the TV.
JUDY
Oh my God, that's my parents!
And
your parents!
Jimmy pans back and we see...
Jimmy proceeds to kick the living fuck out of the TV.
It
smashes against the wall and falls to the floor.
END TV NEWS REPORT
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy is filming the both of them in the mirror. Judy stands
above him with noticeably different hair. She has obviously
given herself a homemade dye job, complete with blonde, black
and punk pink streaks.
Judy has an electric clipper and is about to shave Jimmy's
head, who is sitting in a chair below her. She's really
getting off on this and chuckles as she starts to lower the
shaver to his head.
JIMMY
Wait a second.
JUDY
What?
JIMMY
I just want to look at myself one
last time with hair.
Judy is smiling and can't wait to get started.
JUDY
OK, that's enough.
88.
She starts in again.
JIMMY
Stop.
JUDY
What's the matter?
JIMMY
I'm not sure about this.
JUDY
Come on.
I changed mine.
JIMMY
Yeah, but you look fucking great.
JUDY
This was your idea Jimmy.
Jimmy thinks.
JIMMY
Fuck it.
Let's do this thing.
Judy starts the shaver back up and proceeds to shave Jimmy's
head. She starts right down the middle.
Hair falls into Jimmy's face as Judy slides the buzzer from
front to back. Jimmy now has a reverse Mohawk. He laughs at
himself along with Judy.
JIMMY
This is the look.
Judy then shaves the entire top of Jimmy's head, giving him
the quintessential male pattern baldness look.
He looks ridiculous.
JIMMY
(joking)
Let's just leave it like this.
Judy laughs.
JUDY
Don't be stupid.
Judy shaves the rest of his head and now Jimmy is completely
bald.
Jimmy checks himself out in the mirror.
89.
JIMMY
I am one ugly mother fucker.
Judy is stroking the top of his head with her hands.
JUDY
It feels funny.
Jimmy gives it a feel for himself.
He sticks his pinky in
the side of his mouth.
JIMMY
I look like Dr. Evil.
Judy laughs, then kisses the top of Jimmy's head.
JIMMY
Come on. Let's go across the
street and get a shit burger.
Jimmy shuts down the camera.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. BUN BOY - DINER/PARKING LOT/DINKO'S CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY
In a booth at the motel diner, Judy is filming Jimmy while he
stuffs a burger into his face.
JUDY (O.C.)
You're such a fucking pig when you
eat.
Jimmy opens his mouth full of food and comes towards camera.
JIMMY
Aaaaaaaaaahhh!
JUDY (O.C.)
Gross. That's it. I'm not taking
you to the country club, ever!
That didn't quite sit right with him, but he covers it up
with a mock pout while he chews.
JUDY (O.C.)
(mocking)
Awww... I'm sorry. Did I hurt your
feelings?
Jimmy won't respond, playful.
90.
JUDY (O.C.)
I'll take you to the country club.
I promise.
Jimmy looks up smiling.
JIMMY
When?
JUDY (O.C.)
I don't know.
Judy pauses.
Jimmy keeps chewing.
JUDY (O.C.)
Thanks for marrying me. You're my
prince charming that came and
swooped me off me feet.
The irony is thick. Bald, lanky, 21 year old Jimmy with a
mouth full of food looks like anything but Prince Charming.
JUDY (O.C.)
And one day, we're gonna have a
house and a white picket fence and
a baby. Tell me what you think we
should name the baby.
Jimmy stops smiling.
She really believes that's going to
happen one day.
JUDY (O.C.)
What's wrong?
Jimmy doesn't want to answer.
While he thinks...
Something out the window distracts him.
JUDY (O.C.)
What?
JIMMY
Shhhh. Shut up.
(grabbing camera)
Give it to me.
Jimmy whips the camera around to zoom in on what he's looking
through the window. Finally, we see...
Two Florence County Sheriff's Cars with their lights flashing
are parked in the parking lot of the cheap motel.
Jimmy zooms in on the cops as they get out of their cars.
91.
JUDY (O.C.)
What are they doing?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Shhh.
The cops walk up to one of the doors to the motel room.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Shit.
Four Florence Deputies stand outside the motel room door,
ready to bust it in and raid the room.
JUDY (O.C.)
What?
Jimmy speaks in hushed tones so that others in the diner
won't hear them.
JIMMY (O.C.)
They're outside our room.
JUDY (O.C.)
Oh God, Jimmy! They know where we
are. We're going to get caught!
Florence Deputy #1 knocks on the door, waits a beat, then
busts it down. Three Florence Deputies move in with their
guns drawn.
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy!
JIMMY (O.C.)
(to self)
Let's go.
Jimmy forgets to shut the camera down. He holds it by his
waist as the two quickly struggle to get the hell out of the
diner.
Follow along with them, camera by Jimmy's side, mostly
pointing randomly at the floor of the diner or out the
window.
They head out the door to the...
PARKING LOT
Action continues, the camera still rolling without Jimmy
realizing it. They run at a fast clip along the parking lot
as they head toward...
92.
DINKO'S CAR
JIMMY (O.C.)
Get in.
Jimmy slides into
the driver seat and throws the camera onto
the dashboard. We
see Jimmy behind the wheel as they drive
out of the parking
lot. He's in freak-out mode, afraid as
hell they're going
to be caught by the cops.
JUDY (O.C.)
They don't see us.
JIMMY
I know.
Just shut up!
Let me
think.
Jimmy keeps driving, his eyes darting back and forth between
the road, the rear view mirror and Judy.
JIMMY
Are they coming?
JUDY (O.C.)
I don't know. I don't think so.
Jimmy looks back up into the rear view mirror, still not 100%
satisfied that they're not being chased.
JUDY (O.C.)
No.
I don't think they're coming.
Jimmy's still not certain. He looks for a while. Then he
sighs. It seems that he knows they're not coming.
JIMMY
(relief)
Oh, fuck.
(to Judy)
That was close.
Jimmy drives for a bit, then notices that the camera is on
and pointing at him. He reaches forward and...
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. PARKING AREA BY RIVER AFTER BUN BOY ESCAPE/DINKO'S CAR -
DAY
Jimmy films Judy, who is sleeping in the front seat of the
car.
93.
Jimmy gently wakes her.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Hey baby, wake up baby. Time to
get up little fuck nugget.
Judy opens her eyes.
The first thing she sees is Jimmy
filming her.
Judy smiles like an infant who sees her daddy for the first
time after a night's sleep. Judy, very childlike, opens her
arms for Jimmy to hug her.
Jimmy leans over, camera in hand, and gives her a hug. The
camera shakes and goes out of focus as he's hugging her.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Good morning Mrs. Wright. And how
are we feeling this afternoon?
Judy looks around and is a bit disoriented.
JUDY
Where are we?
JIMMY (O.C.)
It's a surprise. Come on. I want
you to drive us in. I want to film
you when we get there.
JUDY
(big smile)
Okay.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - BACKROAD ENTRY/PARKING
AREA/DINKO'S CAR - DAY
Judy drives up a gravel road as Jimmy films.
They travel
through the back roads in Northern Kentucky.
It's nothing
but woods outside the window.
JUDY
What am I gonna see?
Jimmy doesn't answer.
JUDY
I hate it when you do that.
Tell
me!
94.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Nope.
Keep looking.
Judy drives some more.
The camera is bouncing as they drive
across dirt roads.
Judy tries to maintain her composure, but she can't contain
herself.
JUDY
How much further!
Aaa!
JIMMY (O.C.)
Shhh.
Just drive.
Judy bites her lip and drives.
Slowly, she comes around a
bend as they arrive at...
UNCLE RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND/PARKING AREA
Judy's eyes go wide.
JUDY
Oh my God.
Is that it?
Jimmy doesn't say anything. He just keeps the camera trained
on Judy. By the look on her face, what she's seeing looks
pretty cool.
JUDY
Is this where your friend lives?
Jimmy points the camera through the front windshield. Now we
see what Judy was seeing... about thirty trailers, all along
the water's edge.
It looks like a commune for run-away teenagers with crank
addictions and budding/wannabe drug dealers. The kids are
throwing a combination party, barbecue, and drug festival.
JIMMY (O.C.)
This is where we live.
JUDY
We do?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Maybe. If you want to.
For a
little while.
Judy doesn't respond. She just drives. Her eyes are
starting to well up a little bit. She's getting emotional.
95.
JUDY
This is sooo amazing.
It's like a
dream.
Judy's on cloud nine.
The place has exceeded her
expectations.
Judy keeps driving as we see young people, all more or less
the same age as Jimmy and Judy. Some live in trailers, some
in tents. They watch as Jimmy and Judy drive in. Clearly
new faces are of interest to them.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Go over here.
Out the window, they approach another trailer.
Clearly this
trailer is more important than the others.
Outside, a dorky looking douche bag type, BUDDY (20's) talks
to some of the Younger People in intense language. They all
look over to see Jimmy and Judy approaching.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Stop here.
You can hear the excitement in Jimmy's voice as Judy stops
the car.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Take it.
Jimmy hands off the camera to Judy, who retrains it on the
Buddy and the Wunderland Teenagers he talks to.
Jimmy gets out of Dinko's car and heads up to him while Judy
films. We don't hear the conversation between Jimmy and
Buddy man, but clearly he's happy to see Jimmy.
Buddy gives Jimmy a big hug like he was a missed relative or
an old friend. It's all smiles between the two of them.
Jimmy comes running back over to the car.
JUDY (O.C.)
Is that Uncle Rodney?
JIMMY
No, that's Buddy. He said Rodney's
been expecting us. We're, like,
celebrities or something Judy.
JUDY (O.C.)
Really?
96.
JIMMY
Yeah!
He wants to meet you.
JUDY
Wow.
Camera shakes as Judy starts out of the car.
Camera shuts
down.
CAMERA ON:
Buddy films from the inside their completely destroyed
trailer. Jimmy stands at the entrance with Judy in his arms,
about to carry her over the threshold. They're waiting for
BUDDY's cue.
BUDDY (O.C.)
And, three, two, one... Now!
99.
Jimmy walks in through the doorway with Judy in his arms.
Buddy is exuberant.
He hums the bridal march, badly, as they
come in.
BUDDY (O.C.)
All right! Look at the happy couple
coming into their new home.
(wedding march)
Da, da, da, dum...
Buddy looks down at the camera, right into the lens.
BUDDY
How do you turn this thing off?
After a beat, camera goes off.
Faint moonlight comes into the trailer from outside. Jimmy
is filming Judy as she's just gotten into bed. She sees the
camera's on.
JUDY
Hey again.
JIMMY (O.C.)
So you like it here?
Judy smiles again.
Then...
JUDY
How long will they let us stay?
JIMMY (O.C.)
It's up to Uncle Rodney.
Judy smiles at the thought of Rodney.
JUDY
What's he like?
JIMMY (O.C.)
I never met him. He's supposed to
be cool, though... and weird.
Weird as hell.
JUDY
Well if he's weird, he's great
weird, whatever he is.
(MORE)
102.
JUDY (cont'd)
If we could stay here forever, like
Buddy said, I wouldn't need
anything else.
Judy's looking right over the lens into Jimmy's eyes.
Then...
JUDY
The cops won't come will they?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Buddy said Rodney's cousin's the
Sheriff or something. Do you want
to meet him?
JUDY
(surprised)
The Sheriff?
JIMMY (O.C.)
No!
Rodney.
JUDY
(lights up)
Can I?
JIMMY (O.C.)
I'm gonna see him tomorrow. Buddy
says he wants to talk to me. Maybe
he wants to talk to you too.
JUDY
He does?
JIMMY (O.C.)
I don't know. Buddy said he
thought you were pretty.
JUDY
Oh my God!
Judy puts her hand over her mouth.
She can't believe it.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I told you you were. You're the
prettiest girl in the world.
Judy's on such a cloud nine high, she's almost in tears. She
wraps her arms around him and SQUEALS with delight, pushing
the camera into an awkward position as she smothers him with
kisses, then squeezes him tight, like she's going to squeeze
the life out of him.
She whispers in his ear.
103.
JUDY
(whispers)
I love you Jimmy.
JIMMY
Me too.
Camera off.
CAMERA ON:
Images of UNCLE RODNEY (50) going in and out of focus as he
sits on the side of a king sized bed. Scars and tatoos
litter his arms and neck. His eyes are bit maniacal like
Charles Manson, but he's able to maintain a stoic, but
nonetheless dangerous demeanor as Jimmy begins setting up the
camera.
Like a prison inmate or rabid dog, you get the feeling that
Uncle Rodney could EXPLODE on you at any second.
Jimmy moves the camera around the room so we briefly see the
interior of the trailer. It's an ELABORATE triple
combination of a middle eastern harem, sixties psychedelic
motif, and white trash/junk-yard memorabilia.
JUST OUT OF FRAME we hear a female voice crying softly,
whimpering. The voice is close, in the room with us, but we
can't see who's making the sounds. Uncle Rodney ignores it
completely.
Camera shakes, indicating that Jimmy is exceptionally
nervous.
105.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Just one second.
UNCLE RODNEY
Take your time man. I want you to
feel comfortable. More
importantly, I want you to get this
right.
Finally, the camera stops shaking. Jimmy zooms out to a
medium shot revealing that Uncle Rodney has HAZEL lying next
to him on the bed with her head on his lap.
Uncle Rodney gently strokes her hair like he's petting a dog.
Hazel, in the midst of EXTREME withdrawals, cries and
whimpers like a child, oblivious to Jimmy, the camera, and
everything else in the world except for Uncle Rodney.
She is so strung out and her cravings are so intense that she
can barely speak.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I'm ready whenever you are.
Uncle Rodney looks down upon Hazel.
UNCLE RODNEY
Just a second. I have to take care
of my baby.
Uncle Rodney admires his work.
UNCLE RODNEY
She's beautiful isn't she?
HAZEL
(begging, pleading)
Please...
Hazel, entrenched in a crystal methamphetamine psychotic
episode, can only gasp in unintelligible spurts.
UNCLE RODNEY
Some people come here too far gone.
Like Hazel here. The only thing I
can do for her is ease her pain.
Hazel rolls her body back and forth on the bed, all the while
keeping her head in Uncle Rodney's lap.
HAZEL
Please...
106.
UNCLE RODNEY
(to Hazel)
Shhhhh... How about a baby one?
Uncle Rodney's tenderness in dealing with Hazel calms her.
He's having way too much fun treating her like a baby.
HAZEL
Yes.
Uncle Rodney takes his pinky and dips it into a small plastic
bag of powder. He then places it to Hazel's nostril.
She quickly snorts the tiny bit off his finger.
UNCLE RODNEY
(to Hazel)
There you go...
Hazel begins whimpering again.
It wasn't nearly enough to
satisfy her.
UNCLE RODNEY
There's something about addiction
that brings out something beautiful
in a person. Addiction is pure.
Addiction reduces a person to an
infant. And there's nothing more
pure and beautiful in the world
than an infant.
He puts his finger to Hazel's nostril again, but this time,
without any meth on the tip. She snorts with all of her
might then starts crying. Uncle Rodney is toying with her.
UNCLE RODNEY
Hazel is no longer an adult. She's
an infant and I'm the surrogate
mother who provides her with much
needed breast milk. It's a role
that both of us have accepted and
embrace.
He leans over and grabs a syringe, already filled, then
gently holds Hazel's arm and expertly injects the liquid into
her vein.
Nothing happens for several seconds.
Hazel's breathing accelerates. Suddenly she sits up, her
eyes go wide. Hazel clinches the bed as if she were riding a
roller coaster.
107.
UNCLE RODNEY
(proudly)
That's my girl!
Then, she makes eye contact with Jimmy.
A curious, frightened look comes over her face.
Clearly, she
recognizes him.
She suddenly JUMPS from the bed and runs out of the room.
UNCLE RODNEY
She's a little jumpy.
Uncle Rodney smiles, amusing himself with his own joke.
UNCLE RODNEY
Let's begin shall we? And
please... I'm going to use this
tape for my fans, so let's try to
get this right.
JIMMY (O.C.)
OK.
UNCLE RODNEY
I apologize if any of this
frightens you or makes you
uncomfortable.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I'll be fine.
UNCLE RODNEY
No. You won't be fine. What I'm
going to teach you will be
frightening. The truth is an
acquired taste but once you get to
it, it's all you'll ever want.
Uncle Rodney starts in on his mantra.
It's obvious that he's
well versed in his meandering rant.
UNCLE RODNEY
Those kids out there... we, the so
called "undesirables" - you and me,
we know the truth. You know that
society doesn't want you, your
parents don't want you, corporate
America sure as fuck doesn't want
you... You wouldn't be here
otherwise.
(MORE)
108.
UNCLE RODNEY (cont'd)
If this government had a choice,
they'd gas us all in a heartbeat,
exterminate us like the Jews,
enslave us like niggers, cuz don't
kid yourself, WE ARE the new
niggers in this country. No one
respects us... No one sees what we
have to offer... No one has
compassion for us.... They don't
care, or they're too naive to see
that we're a by-product of a
wasteful society that has failed to
educate, embrace, influence, or
inspire any of us. We're societal
garbage. The counter culture no
longer exists. It's dead... It's
been replaced by us--
Long pause.
UNCLE RODNEY
The garbage culture... thrown
aside, imprisoned,
institutionalized, systematically
abused, executed, and enlisted into
wars started by government ass-
fuckers just to kill us off. JUST
TO KILL US OFF. And every week one
of you shows up here,
disillusioned, addicted, angry,
pissed 'cuz they tossed you
aside... into the garbage. Every
time someone like you shows up here
the garbage culture gets a little
bit stronger and they get a little
bit weaker. Until the "them" and
the "they" of this country run out
of places to put us, to put its
garbage, and the garbage OVER-FLOWS
into their cities from out of the
confines of the spaces that they
have set aside for us.
A pause, then...
UNCLE RODNEY
(biblical)
And we will SET FIRE to their
world! And we will burn it, until
a living HELL REIGNS over what was
their former world, and we will
fornicate in their ashes!
Rodney stops, almost out of breath.
109.
UNCLE RODNEY
That's what's here for you.
That's
what's here...
Rodney settles himself down and takes a few deep breaths as
Jimmy begins zooming out. Uncle Rodney lights a cigarette to
calm himself.
Jimmy keeps filming, not knowing whether Rodney is finished
or just taking a break.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
Close on Judy. The afternoon light strikes a shadow across
her face. Her hair's a mess. No makeup.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy, sweetie. Come on honey.
I
saw you waking up.
118.
Judy's eyes flutter.
JIMMY (O.C.)
There ya go.
Judy opens her eyes.
She smiles when she sees Jimmy behind
the lens.
JUDY
Hi, baby.
JIMMY (O.C.)
You okay?
JUDY
Am I with you?
JIMMY (O.C.)
You're with me.
She smiles wider.
JUDY
Then I'm okay.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. HIGHWAY TO BORDER/DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT
Judy's got the camera trained on herself.
She talks like a
child.
JUDY
Mexicooooooh....
Judy points the camera up at Jimmy. This is the first time
we've seen him at all since he was beaten up by Uncle
Rodney's group. He's a wreck. His face is puffy. His lip
is cut up. His eye is swollen. He looks like a flyweight
boxer who just went fifteen rounds with a heavyweight.
He drives with one arm because the other one is in a bandage.
JUDY (O.C.)
Hey baby.
Jimmy looks like a beaten man, both physically and
emotionally. His bad ass attitude and rebellious charisma
are seemingly non-existent.
119.
For the first time, we are seeing Jimmy without his armor.
He looks like any other 21 year old kid who is down,
vulnerable, and confused. Not to mention the fact that he
has a fucking bullet lodged in his shoulder.
JUDY (O.C.)
Baby?
JIMMY
Come on.
Not the camera.
JUDY (O.C.)
Nooooo. It reminds me of when we
first met. Just you, me, and the
camera. God, do you remember how
you used to freak me out?
JIMMY
Yeah, those were the good old days.
How much money do we have?
JUDY (O.C.)
I don't know, why?
JIMMY
How do you feel about Canada?
It's
closer.
JUDY (O.C.)
Are we going together?
Jimmy looks over at her.
JIMMY
I think I should take you home.
Judy doesn't answer.
JIMMY
I could write you a letter. Or I
could make a video saying I made
you do everything. They'd believe
you. You could tell them it was
all my fault. You could tell them
I was going to Mexico and I'd
really go to Canada.
Jimmy swallows.
JIMMY
We swore on the bond we'd never be
apart... but...
(MORE)
120.
JIMMY (cont'd)
I'll let you out of it... If you
want to be out of it, I'll let you
out.
JUDY (O.C.)
You're never leaving me, and I'm
never leaving you. That's all
there is to it.
JIMMY
Okay.
Judy leans in and kisses him.
JIMMY
Owww.
Judy comes back into the passenger seat and just films him.
She likes looking at him through the lens.
JUDY (O.C.)
You're so handsome, you know that?
Jimmy smiles as best he can with his face all messed up.
Then his eyes get droopy and close.
He's not responding. He's as punch drunk as you can get.
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy?
Jimmy's obviously in a concussion induced daze. The car
starts to drift. Judy drops the camera on the seat as we
hear her leap forward to take control of the car.
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy!
JIMMY (O.C.)
(snaps to)
What?
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy, stop the car. You're too
fucked up to drive.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(groggy)
Huh? Oh... okay.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
121.
I/E. HIGHWAY FINAL-SCENE/DINKO'S CAR - DAY
Judy drives.
There isn't much talking going on.
JUDY
You wanted to ask me something?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Do you love me?
JUDY
You know I do.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I do.
The car drives. Judy just cruises along, music playing on
the radio. Jimmy (O.C.) looks in the mirror but keeps the
camera trained on her.
JIMMY (O.C.)
You know I love you, right?
JUDY
Yup.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy?
JUDY
Yes?
JIMMY (O.C.)
We're fucked.
JUDY
What do you mean?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Look in the rearview mirror.
Judy looks up immediately.
Her face drops.
Jimmy flips the camera around out the back window. There's a
Ohio State Trooper with its lights flashing tailing them. A
lone trooper is on his radio.
JIMMY (O.C.)
That's it baby. We're done.
Judy doesn't answer.
She's short circuited.
122.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Just pull over. It's not worth it.
Judy holds still for a second, not saying a word.
The cop car CHIRPS its siren.
Judy looks up.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy, what are you doing?
You know
this is...
JUDY
Don't do this.
Judy looks up into the rearview mirror. Her eyes are welling
up. She looks out the front windshield.
Jimmy senses that she sees something. He flips the camera
around through the front only to see a row of cop cars
blocking the highway up ahead.
He flips the camera back at her.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy?
JUDY
(freaks)
Shut up!
Judy looks straight ahead, determination on her face.
She won't answer.
Then...
She turns the wheel hard to the right, almost carrying Jimmy
into her, and takes the car onto a side road.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I love you.
JUDY
I love you too.
Judy is on her own mission.
JIMMY (O.C.)
It's over.
JUDY
(soft)
No.
123.
JIMMY (O.C.)
It is.
JUDY
No.
The car stops short. Jimmy turns the camera to point out the
windshield. They're stuck. The road has come to a dead end.
JIMMY (O.C.)
It's a dead end.
Judy ignores Jimmy. She throws the car into reverse and
tries to turn it around and head back the way she came.
A faint sound of a helicopter fades up slowly from the
background.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Do you hear that?
Judy doesn't respond.
She's determined.
JUDY
(lying)
No.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Come on, it's over. I'll do what I
said before. I'll tell them I made
you do it. It'll be okay.
JUDY
No.
I want us to be together.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(screams)
Well we fucking can't, so pull the
fuck over!
JUDY
Yes we can. I won't give you up.
I won't let you go. No way.
Jimmy pans the camera out the front windshield. In the
distance, we catch sight of a road block that's been set up
at the end of the dirt trail. They're screwed. There's
nowhere to go.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Come on.
Judy doesn't answer.
124.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy?
She still doesn't answer.
Then the car thrusts itself forward.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy!
Stop it.
Judy's got a look of determination in her eye.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy, what are you doing?
Judy doesn't respond. O.C., she's murmuring something to
herself that Jimmy can't hear or understand while she has the
throttle to the floor as they barrel toward the roadblock.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy!
Judy keeps going.
Jimmy flips the back camera towards her.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy!
Stop!
Judy's murmurs grow louder.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy!
Jimmy braces himself as the car continues toward the
roadblock.
Suddenly, Judy's murmurs get loud enough or us to hear.
JUDY
(murmurs)
We'll be together. We'll be
together. We'll be together.
We'll be together...
They head straight in between two cars that form the
roadblock. Cops jump out of the way as the car hits head on
into...
THE ROADBLOCK
Impact sends the camera flying against the windshield,
CRACKING IT.
125.
Sounds of metal twisting and glass shattering is all
encompassing as the camera shakes in a violent frenzy!
Camera settles on Judy's face, bloody, unconscious against
the steering wheel, her neck snapped, eyes open in a death
stare.
Camera stays focussed on Judy for the longest time as she
leans against the steering wheel. Music plays on the radio.
It's JOHNNY CASH's cover of Tom Petty's "I won't Back Down".
OVERHEAD SHOT of a news helicopter flying above the final
scene.
Looking down from above, we see what the helicopter sees:
A scene of about twelve State Trooper cars, lights flashing,
with Jimmy and Judy's car wrecked. Ambulances are there.
Jimmy and Judy's lifeless bodies are pulled from their car as
Johnny Cash's song shifts from background to score.
The helicopter continues its circular pattern as the song
continues and we...
FADE TO BLACK.
Jimmy and Judy
