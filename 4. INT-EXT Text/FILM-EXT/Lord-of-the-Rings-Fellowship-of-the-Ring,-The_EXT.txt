GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It was in this moment..when all hope had
faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.
ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL..The BLADE
severs SAURON'S FINGERS... AND THE ONE RING FLIES from his
body.

It waited.
FADE UP: Bathed in COLD MOONLIGHT, the WORLD lies DARK and
STILL...the unsettled quiet before the storm...
GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Darkness crept back into the forests of
the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
East...whispers of a nameless fear. And
the Ring of Power perceived...its time
had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

White flowers are scattered among the Well seeded grasses.
An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the
figure is reading a book. ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance,
growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching
cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to
the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..."
SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight
at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair
and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight
with EXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his
mouth, Frodo runs off.

The cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped
figure in Grey.
INTERCUT WITH; SHOTS OF FRODO RUNNING... CAREERING DOWN A
HILL. . .JUMPING OVER LOGS... DODGING TREE BRANCHES.

appears on a bank above the cart.
FRODO
You're late.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...
GANDALF
A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
nor is he early. He arrives precisely
when he means to.
They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as
FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front
seat of the cart.
FRODO
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3
foot 6 inches tall.
GANDALF
You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
Bilbo's birthday?
CUT TO:

Wide on: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended by
HOBBITS.
FRODO
What news of the outside world? Tell me
everything!
ANGLE ON:
Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.
GANDALF
What, everything? Far too eager and
curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...
Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy
Hobbit Marketplace.
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
wide world goes on much as if it has past
age. Full of its own comings and goings,
scarcely even aware of the existence of
Hobbits...
Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
...for which I am very thankful.
ANGLE ON:
Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon
Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scOrcs of
Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
a Party of Special Magnificence.

GANDALF
Good gracious, me.
FRODO
He's up to something.
GANDALF
Oh, really?
Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.
FRODO
Alright then..keep your secrets. Before
you came along we Bagginses were very
well thought of.
GANDALF
Indeed?
FRODO
Never had any adventures or did anything
unexpected.
GANDALF
If you're referring to the incident with
the Dragon...I was barely involved...all
I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
out the door.
FRODO
Whatever you did...you've been officially
labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.
GANDALF
Oh, really?
ANGLE ON:
ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply
suspicious.
CUT TO:
CRANE UP:
As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a
quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills
and large trees.

CONTINUED:
The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the
grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.
ANGLE ON:
Excited children, chasing after the cart.
CLOSE ON:
Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries. The children stand
deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane. At that
moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of
the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.
ANGLE ON:
Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. ODO
PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in
the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.
FRODO
Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo
leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf
smiles.
GANDALF
So am I, dear boy...so am I
CUT TO:
Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG
END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a
large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is
a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON
PARTY BUSINESS." Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag
End. He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a
voice calls out:
BILBO (O.S.)
No, thank you! We don't want any more
visitors, well wishers, or distant
relations.
GANDALF
And what about very old friends?
Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him.
He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous
Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he
looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.

BILBO
Gandalf?
GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins!
BILBO
My dear Gandalf!
Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.
GANDALF
It's good to see you. One hundred and
eleven years old, who would believe it!
Gandalf looks at him more keenly.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
laugh together and enter Bag End.
BILBO
Come on, come in!
Welcome, welcome!!
CUT TO:
BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above
Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding
branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down
from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned
faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and
drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the
tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark
that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting
visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo
notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,
Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.
FRODO
Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.
SAM
(horrified)
I think I'll just have myself another
ale.
FRODO
Oh, no you don't. Go on.
Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of
his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing
throng of dancers.
15.
ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE
as he is Swept away.
Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.
ANGLE ON:
Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework
that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.
Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a
group of young hobbit children.
BILBO
(melodramatic)
So, there I was...at the mercy of three
monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of
a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
things..and they're arguing...arguing
about how they were going to cook us!
ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S
upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.
BILBO
Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
in a pie or whether they were going to
sit on us one by one and squash us into
jelly! But they spent so long arguing
the whether-to's and why-for's that the
sun's first light crept over the top of
the trees...and turned them all to stone!
STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing
feat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young
Hobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back
of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework
MERRY
(urgent whisper)
No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin
grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK
FUSE crackles with flame!
Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the
fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.
MERRY (CONT'D)

You're supposed to stick it in the
ground!

PIPPIN
It is in the ground.
Merry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin!
The fuse
sizzles angrily.
MERRY
Outside!
PIPPIN
It was your idea.
Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.
WHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in
a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening
power. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low
towards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the
Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the
Panicking crowd and impending danger!
FRODO
Bilbo!
Watch out for the dragon!!
BILBO
Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years!
ANGLE ON: FRODO
As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon
roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express
train! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents
collapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a
somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night.
ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN,
clothes and hair smoking.
MERRY
That was good!

LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears.

applause.
FRODO

BILBO
Today is my one hundred and eleventh
birthday. Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one
years is far too short a time to live
among such excellent and admirable
Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of approval!
BILBO (CONT'D)
I don't know half of you half as well as
I should like; and I like less than half
of you as well as well as you deserve.
SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was
a compliment or not. CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to
themselves. CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his
head. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow.
Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and
holds it behind his back.

I regret to announce, this is the end. I
am going now. I bid you all a very fond
farewell!! Bilbo looks across at Frodo,
hesitates... then...
BILBO (CONT'D)

Goodbye.
Bilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an
uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet.

The party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away

Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.
ANGLE ON:
Bilbo staggering out of Bag end...he braces himself in the
night air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring has
weakened him. Gandalf steps up behind.

to the end of his days."
GANDALF
I'm sure you will, my dear friend.
BILBO
Goodbye, Gandalf.

Is it safe?
FRODO NODS...he pats his pocket.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Never put it on, for then the agents of

Frodo and Sam continue their journey.
BILBO (V.O.)
... it's a dangerous business, Frodo,
going out your door...you step onto the
road, and if you don't keep your feet,
there's not knowing where you might be
swept off to.

Gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient
forest of Fangorn. Nestled in a basin at the foot of the
distant Misty Mountains, the tall black tower of Orthanc is
clearly visible
Gandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of
ISENGARD...a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to
rim, encloses beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams
that flow down from the mountains.
SARUMAN (V.O.)
Smoke rises once more from the mountain

darkness of Mordor; the hour grows

black obsidian...rises up in the center of the Isengard
Circle. Gandalf arrives at the foot of the Orthanc Stairs.

long ride.
GANDALF
Saruman!

Gandalf and Saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees

Gandalf's dusty grey robes.
SARUMAN
Are you sure of this?
GANDALF
Beyond any doubt.
SARUMAN
So the ring of power has been found?
GANDALF
All these long years it was in the Shire,
under my very nose.
SARUMAN
And yet you did not have the wit to see
it! Your love of the Halfling's leaf has
clearly slowed your mind.
GANDALF
We still have time...time enough to
counter Sauron...if we act quickly.
SARUMAN
Time?
What time do you think we have?
CUT TO:
Wide on: Frodo and Sam walking along a country lane which

surprised as Sam comes running towards
him.

I thought I lost you. Frodo looks at Sam
suspiciously. Sam glances down,
embarrassed.
FRODO

What are you talking about?
SAM

It's just something Gandalf said...
FRODO
What did he say?
SAM
He said..."Don't you leave him, Samwise
Gamgee."

could possibly happen?

Who's that in my field!
Get out of it!
Get out of my field, you

(looking behind him)
I don't know why he's so upset, it's only
a couple of carrots.
PIPPIN
And some cabbages...and those three bags
of potatoes that we lifted last week.
And then the mushrooms the week before.
MERRY
Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly
over reacting.
The BAYING OF LARGE DOGS sounds!
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
PIPPIN
Run!
CUT TO:
Frodo, Sam, and Merry and Pippin tumble head over heels down
a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. CLOSE ON: A winded Pippin,
his face inches away from a large pile of Horse droppings...
PIPPIN
That was close.
Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly.
MERRY
(groaning)
Ow...I think I've broken something.
Pulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle,
out from his back pocket.
MERRY (CONT'D)
Oh.
SAM
(turning on Merry and Pippin)
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.
MERRY
What? That was just a detour...a
shortcut.
SAM
A shortcut to what?
Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of
the road.
PIPPIN
(excited)
Mushrooms!
CLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy
undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the
mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are
on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling
down the road as if blown by an invisible wind...
41.
SUDDENLY... THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES...
FRODO
I think we should get off the road.
A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some
evil and lonely creature.
FRODO (CONT'D)
(more urgency)
Get off the road!
Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble
down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES
is close... A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into
view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black
horse with insane eyes ! Frodo freezes in terror. The
RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits
very still with his head bowed, listening. From inside the
hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an
elusive scent; his head turning from side to side.
CLOSE ON: FRODO
Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly
slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering
suspiciously into the woods.
CLOSE ON: FRODO
He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling
hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of
some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. The SOUND OF SNIFFING
intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to
side like a bird of party.
CLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT...
QUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS!
AND EVIL DARK TOWER...A GREAT EYE...A
BURST OF FLAME.
ANGLE ON:
SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN
SAM
Frodo?
Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the
ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far
side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly
slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken
(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:
MERRY
What was that?
Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring
lying in the palm of his hand.
Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the
trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground.
SAM
Anything?
FRODO
Nothing.
PIPPIN
What is going on?
Merry moves past pippin, toward Frodo, watching
intently...Sam keeps looking around nervously.
MERRY
The Black rider was looking for
something...or someone...Frodo?
SAM
Get down!
The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline.
The Four Hobbits... sprawled on the ground, holding their
breath. The BLACK RIDER turns and departs.
FRODO
I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I
must get to Bree.
Merry looks at his friend...realizing Frodo is in deep
trouble.
MERRY
Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me !
The Hobbits break cover. SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of
the forest TOWARD THEM!
MERRY (CONT'D)
There's another one!! Frodo, this way! !
The Hobbits run
THE RINGWRAITH SHRIEKS!
QUICK CUTS:
(CONTINUED)
43.

Black horse hooves... snarling horse mouths...a fleeting
black cowl.
MERRY (CONT'D)
Frodo, follow me!
CUT TO:
FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN, are running towards the wide,
placid Brandywine river...and the FERRY.
MERRY
Get the ropes, Sam.
QUICK ANGLES: STOMPING HOOVES...SNARLING HORSES...
Four RINGWRAITHS are speeding through the Fog...converging on
the FERRY CROSSING. The HOBBITS stampede across the Wharf and
Tumble onto the Ferry.
SAM
(screaming)
Frodo!
Frodo races across the Wooden Wharf, followed by the
ringwraiths. He leaps into the Ferry.
CLOSE ON: HOOVES THUNDER DOWN THE WOODEN WHARF!
Sam and Merry shove off with the poles...the ferry slides out
into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. They pull up
on the end of the wharf... shrieking with rage! The Hobbits
cover their ears. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards
the north and Gallop away along the river bank, quickly
disappearing into the fog.
FRODO
How far to the nearest crossing?
MERRY
The brandwine bridge...twenty miles.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON:
Lights of Bree...a small village of stone and half timbered
houses nestled against a low wooded hill.
(CONTINUED)
44.
CONTINUED:
A thick hedge surrounds the village...a great gate bars the
western entrance.
CLOSE ON:
FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN approaching the gatehouse...wild
eyes, ragged, and out of breath.
FRODO
Come on.
A SURLY GATEKEEPER glances down at them.
GATEKEEPER
What do you want?
FRODO
We're headed for the prancing pony.
The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing
them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight.
GATEKEEPER
Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,
out of the Shire by your talk. What
business brings you to Bree?
FRODO
We wish to stay at the inn...our business
is our own. To Frodo's relief, the
Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.
GATEKEEPER
All right, young sir, I meant no offense.
The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree...the gatekeeper eyeing
them curiously in the lantern light.
GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
It's my job to ask questions after
nightfall. There's talk of strange fold
abroad...can't be too careful.
CUT TO:
The tall BREE FOLK loom over the nervous little hobbits as
Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin make their way through the
Narrow Streets. Tall buildings tower above them...lights
glow dimly from behind thick curtains.
(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:
Close on: The sign of the "PRANCING PONY INN"...Frodo, Sam,
Merry, and Pippin hurry toward it.
CUT TO:
The RINGWRAITHS turn sharply in their saddles...Instantly
aware that the ring is being worn. They spur their horses
towards the distant lights of Bree.
48.
The gate keeper comes out of his Lodgings with a lantern...a
look of fear on his face. He approaches the closed gate with
great apprehension. CLOSE ON: The Gatekeeper peers out of his
Peephole.
CRASH!!
The gate crashed down on the gatekeeper...as four RINGWRAITHS
ride into Bree!
50.
The four RINGWRAITHS fly done the empty streets, like
horsemen of the apocalypse.
ANGLE ON:
STRIDER, MERRY, PIPPIN, AND FRODO march through a gloomy,
overgrown forest. Sam follows at the read leading "Bill", a
scrawny pony, who is laden with supplies.
FRODO
Where are you taking us?
STRIDER
Into the wild.
Frodo watches uneasily as Strider moves off into the cover of
the trees...
MERRY
(whispered aside)
How do, we know this Strider is a friend
of Gandalf?
FRODO
We have no choice but to trust him.
STRIDER
But where is he leading us?
ANGLE ON:
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
Strider stops, casts a glance back at Sam.
STRIDER (CONT'D)
To Rivendell, Master Gamgee...to the
house of Elrond.
SAM looks excited.
SAM
Did you hear that, Bill? Rivendell!
We're going to see the Elves!
Strider leads the Hobbits through the gloom of the forest.
CUT TO:
Aerial on: Strider leading Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin
across the windswept moors. The hobbits suddenly stop and
unstrap their knapsacks.
STRIDER
Gentlemen, we do not stop until
nightfall.
PIPPIN
What about breakfast?
STRIDER
You've already had it.
PIPPIN
We've had one, yes...but what about
Second Breakfast?
Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking
his head.
MERRY
I don't think he knows about second
breakfast, Pip.
PIPPIN
What about Elvenses, Luncheon, Afternoon
Tea, dinner...he knows about them,
doesn't he?
MERRY
I wouldn't count on it.
An apple is thrown to Merry, who deftly catches it.
Another,
aimed at Pippin, catches him on the forehead.

MERRY (CONT'D)
(exasperated)
Pippin!
The hobbits trudge through rain, looking tired, hungry, and
miserable.
CUT TO:
Wide on: The rugged countryside as the hobbits journey on,
lead by Strider. Strider stops before a distant hill, topped
by an Ancient Ruin.
SARUMAN
This was once the great Watchtower of
Amon Sul. We shall rest here tonight.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON:
FRODO, MERRY, AND PIPPIN collapse into a small hollow,
halfway up Weathertop...they are muddy and exhausted. Stider
drops 4 small swords at the Hobbits feet.
SARUMAN
There are for you. Keep them close. I'm
going to have a look around. Stay here.
CUT TO:
Close on: Frodo...eyes flickering open. He suddenly sits up,
sniffing the air. Sam, Merry, and Pippin huddled over a small
fire... Sausages and bacon sizzle in a hot frying pan.
FRODO
What are you doing?
MERRY
Tomatoes, sausages, and crispy bacon.
(CONTINUED)
55.

SAM
We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
FRODO
Put it out, you fools! Put it out! Frodo
desperately kicks dirt on the fire!
PIPPIN
Oh, that's nice...ash on my tomatoes!
A SUDDEN SHREIK!
ANGLE ON:
FIVE RINGWRAITHS ON FOOT, running up the steep slope
unnaturally fast.
FRODO
Go! !
Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin clamber desperately towards the
summit, clutching their swords.
CUT TO:
Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin race into a RING OF BROKEN
STONES on the summit or Weathertop...the ruined base of an
ancient tower. The hobbits stand back-to-back in the centre
of the Ring, waiting for the first assault... One by one, the
5 Ringwraiths appear...brandishing Gleaming swords, they move
slowly towards the hobbits. In the center is their
leader...the WITCH KING!
SAM
Back, you devils!
Sam rushes forward with a cry. He swings his sword at the
Witch King, who blocks the blow with his own sword. Sam's
blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist,
sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror,
throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in
on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head...
Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting
the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into
his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a
chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any
longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He
disappears.
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
SAM (CONT'D)
No!
IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:
ANGLE ON:
Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world...he looks
upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE:
Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and
Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand
towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's
trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the
ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.
The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo
with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger
sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the
RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch
in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea
of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint
image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.
With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off
his finger...
IN THE REAL WORLD:
...Appearing back in the real world, Sam rushes over to him.
SAM (CONT'D)
(horrified)
Frodo!
Another Ringwraith is burning and screaming...others screech
fearfully at the flames, turn and flee form the Weathertop
summit.
SAM (CONT'D)
(panicked)
Mr. Frodo!!
Strider kneels before Frodo. He snatches up the Witch King's
Dagger from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin,
blade.
SAM (CONT'D)
Help him, Strider!
STRIDER
(grim)
He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. The
Morgul Blade suddenly melts...vanishing
into the air like smoke. Strider throws
the hilt down in disgust...
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED: (2)
SAM
Do something.
STRIDER
This is beyond my skill to heal.
(urgently)
He needs Elvish medicine. Strider lifts
Frodo onto his shoulders.
Strider is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing Frodo on his
back. Sam, Merry, and Pippin are running to keep up. The
hobbits are carrying Flaming torches for protection.
STRIDER
Hurry!
SAM
We are six days from Rivendell. Frodo
groans.
STRIDER
Hold on, Frodo.
SAM
He'll never make it! Close on:
Frodo...head lolling about, barely
conscious.
FRODO
(fevered calling)
Gandalf...Gandalf?
Low angle...looking up at ORTHANC...the tower of Isengard,
gleaming in the moonlight. The camera rises to reveal the
once beautiful gardens are not a pitted wasteland...with
smoke and fire billowing out
of numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt
of ORTHANC. Strange guttural chants echo up from deep
underground. The camera is rising...a small moth flutters
into shot...and leads the camera towards the summit or
Orthanc. Gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very
top of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. He
looks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep. The MOTH
flutters close to Gandalf. His hand suddenly moves at
lighting speed and SNATCHES THE MOTH. Gandalf brings his hand
close to his face and opens it. The moth sits on the palm of
his hand as Gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue.
Close on: THE MOTH'S face... seemingly listening.
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
It suddenly flutters away. CAMERA FOLLOWS the moth off the
Orthanc summit, but drops past the moth...falling down, down,
towards the pitted wasteland, straight into a fiery red
tunnel!
Close on: Frodo...his eyes flicker open...clouded, red-
rimmed...his brow, beaded with sweat.
PIPPIN
Is he going to die? Frodo's breathing is
getting shallow. Strider looks out into
the darkness.
STRIDER
No. He is passing into the shadow world,
he will soon become a wraith like them.
A DISTANT CRY of a RINGWRAITH carries through the air.
MERRY
(nervous)
They're close.
Frodo gasps in sudden pain.
STRIDER
(thinking hard)
Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? Sam
looks blank.
SAM
Athelas?
STRIDER
Kingsfoil.
SAM
Kingsfoil.
Aye.
It's a weed.
(CONTINUED)
59.

STRIDER
It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!
CUT TO:
Sam and Strider desperately search the dark forest floor for
the Athelas plant. Close on: A small, white flowered plant!
Strider drops to one knee, carefully pulling it from the
ground.
SUDDENLY!
STRIDER FREEZES AS A SWORD BLADE TOUCHES HIS NECK.
ARWEN (O.S.)
What is this? A Ranger caught off his
guard?
Strider slowly looks up.
CUT TO:
Frodo is breathing hard, desperately ill. Frodo's half-
conscious POV: Surreal impression...a SHIMMERING FIGURE IN
WHITE leaps off a horse.
FLASH INSERT: An ethereal vision of ARWEN, as she appears on
the other side...
ARWEN

Who now appears in her earth bound form, a young Elven woman
with tousled hair, dressed in mud-splattered riding clothes.
ARWEN
He's fading...he's not gong to last. We
must get him to my father. Strider
quickly lifts Frodo...placing him on the
horse.
ARWEN (CONT'D)
I have been looking for you for two days.
PIPPIN
Where are you taking him?
ARWEN
There are five Wraiths behind you, where

The white horse charges through a Pine Forest. Suddenly 2
Galloping Ringwraiths emerge from the trees behind! 2 more
Ringwraiths slide in from different directions to join the
chase. Arwen grits her teeth...urges the white horse to
greater speed.

The white horse speeds out of the pine trees...the 4
ringwraiths close behind PAN ONTO: 2 more ringwraiths

CRANE DOWN: As the White Horse races towards Camera, to
Reveal the wide river Bruinen in the foreground.
Without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow
water and thunders across the Ford. The 9 Ringwraiths pull up
short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water. The white
horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to
defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford.
WITCH KING
Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws
her sword and yells at the Witch King.
ARWEN
(yelling)
If you want him, come and claim him.
THE WITCH KING SCREECHES ANGRILY, draws his sword, and leads
the Ringwraiths across the Ford. The water starts flowing
faster...a distant rumble can be heard. Arwen waits until
they are halfway across: she suddenly stands in the saddle
arms raised!

THE GROUND SUDDENLY TREMBLES...A MIGHTY ROAR FILLS THE AIR!
Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water
flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had
burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing
white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in
terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing
cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries
them away! CLOSE ON: FRODO as he loses consciousness...
ARWEN

No, no...Frodo, no!
Frodo, don't give

Arwen gathers the small Hobbit in her arms, feeling his life
slip away.
SARUMAN stands over Gandalf, gloating...
SARUMAN
Get up! So much for the power of the
Ring or embrace your own destruction!
With the power of his staff, Saruman raises Gandalf from the
ground, then sends him crashing to the floor.
GANDALF
There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only
one who can bend it to his will...and he
does not share power.
SUDDENLY! GANDALF lurches to his feet and Throws himself off
the Tower! Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from
Isengard...on the Back of a GIANT EAGLE.

ELROND (V.O.)
You have found your way to the last
homely house east of the sea. The elves

my kin now remain. Frodo looks out from
his balcony.
CUT TO:
Frodo and Sam walk together. Suddenly, the voices of Merry
and Pippin can be heard as they bound up to Frodo and throw
their arms around him.
MERRY
Frodo!
Frodo!
Sam looks past Frodo smiling... a bent figure sits alone on a
bench, in the Sun. Close on: Frodo turning, following Sam's
gaze...
FRODO
Bilbo!
CUT TO:
Close on: BILBO BAGGINS! He breaks in to a broad grin as
Frodo rushes forward to embrace him. Bilbo has aged
significantly since we last saw him.
BILBO
Hello, Frodo, my lad!
FRODO
Bilbo!
LATER... Frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of
a red leather bound journal:
FRODO (CONT'D)
(reading)
"There and back again: A Hobbit's tale"
by Bilbo Baggins.
Bilbo smiles Proudly. He is sitting with Frodo on a terrace
overlooking a Waterfall. Frodo looks at Page after page of
beautiful Handwriting, with intricate Maps and Drawings.

FRODO (CONT'D)
This is wonderful.
BILBO
I meant to go back...wander the paths of
Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely
Mountain again...but age, it seems, has
finally caught up with me.
Frodo turns a page...there before him, is a map of the Shire.
FRODO
(quietly)
I miss the Shire...I spent all my
childhood pretending I was off somewhere
else...off with you, on one of your
adventures...
(Looks at Bilbo)
But my own adventure, turned out to be
quite different...I'm not like you,
Bilbo.
BILBO
My dear boy...
CUT TO:
Sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his
already full pack...pots and pans, blankets, cooking
utensils, provisions, clothes.
SAM
No, what have I forgotten? Pull back to
reveal Frodo, hands in his pocket,
watching Sam.
FRODO
Packed already?
Sam looks up, startled.
SAM
(slightly embarrassed)
No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls
to the edge of the Balcony.
FRODO
I thought you wanted to see the Elves,
Sam?
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
SAM
I do...
FRODO
More than anything.
SAM
I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf
wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this
far, to Rivendell...and I thought...
seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
off soon. Off home.
FRODO
You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam...
FRODO (CONT'D)
...we did what we set out to do. Frodo
opens his hand, the Ring sits in his
Palm.
FRODO (CONT'D)
The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am
ready to go home.
CUT TO:
Gandalf and Elrond watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony,
ELROND
His strength returns.
GANDALF
That wound will never fully heal. He will
carry it the rest of his life.
ELROND
And yet to have come so far still bearing
the Ring...the hobbit has shown
extraordinary resilience to its evil.
GANDALF
It is a burden he should never have to
had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.
ELROND
Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's
forces are massing in the east. His eye
is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you
tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of
allies grows thin.
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF
His treachery runs deeper than you know.
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
can move in Sunlight and cover great
distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
the Ring.
Elrond turns and walks away...
ELROND
This evil cannot be concealed by the
power of the Elves...We do not have the
strength to fight both Mordor and
Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay
here.
Gandalf turns and looks out the window.
Sounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through
Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.
ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
This peril belongs to all Middle earth.
They must decide how to end it. Not just
for themselves but for those who come
after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.
ELROND (CONT'D)
The time of the Elves is over. My people
are leaving these shores. Who will you
look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
They hide in their mountains seeking
riches. They care nothing for the
troubles of others.
GANDALF
It is in Men that we must place our hope.
ELROND
Men? Men are weak.
The race of Men is
failing. The blood
of Numenor is all but
spent, its pride and
dignity forgotten.
It is because of men
the Ring survives.
FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off
Sauron's finger. Elrond reacts.
ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I was there, Gandalf...I was there three
thousand years ago when Isildur took the
ring.

FLASH INSERT: ISILDUR PICKS UP THE RING AND STARES AT IT,
ENTRANCED.
ELROND
I was there the day the strength of Men
failed.

(Elvish: with subtitles)
Renech I lu I erui govannem?
Do you
remember when we first met?
STRIDER
(Elvish: with subtitles)
Nauthannim I ned ol reniannen.
I thought
I had strayed into a dream.
Arwen reaches up and gently touches the Grey at Strider's
temples.
ARWEN
(Elvish: with subtitles)
Gwenin in enniath...u-arnech in naeth I
se celich. Long years have passed...you
did not have the care you carry now.
Arwen looks into Strider's eyes.
ARWEN (CONT'D)
(Elvish: with subtitles)
Renech I Beth I pennen? Do you remember
what I told you? Arwen reaches for
Strider's hand...
STRIDER
(quietly)
You said you'd bind yourself to me,
forsaking the immortal life of your
people.
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:
ARWEN
(whisper)
And to that I hold. I would rather share
one lifetime with you than face all the
ages of this world alone. Strider looks
down. In his hand lies the Evenstar.
ARWEN (CONT'D)
I choose a mortal live.
STRIDER
You cannot give me this.
ARWEN
It is mine to give to whom I will, like
my heart.
Arwen closes Strider's fingers around the jewel.
Arwen leans towards Strider, gently kissing him.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON:
The Fellowship climb the long steep path out of the cloven
vale of Rivendell.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON:
The fellowship trekking through a land of Deep Valleys and
turbulent waters...the misty mountains rise sharply to their
left.
GANDALF (V.O.)
We must hold to his course west of the
misty Mountains for forty days. If our
luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still
be open to us. From there, our road
turns east, to Mordor.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: Sam at the campfire. The sound of clashing swords!
Wider: Aragorn and Boromir are giving Pippin Sword tuition...
(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED:
BOROMIR
Get away from the blade, Pippin...on your
toes...good, very good...I want you to
react, not think.
SAM
Should not be too hard...
BOROMIR
Move your feet.
MERRY
Quite good, Pippin.
PIPPIN
Thanks.
CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf....
GIMLI
If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
which I note they have not, I would say
we are taking the long way round.
Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks
that is a bad idea.
GANDALF
No, Gimli. I would not take the road
through Moria unless I had no other
choice.
Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws
down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to
the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a
distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying
smoke in the wind.
SAM
What is that?
GIMLI
Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud.
BOROMIR
(worried)
It's moving fast...against the wind.
LEGOLAS
Crebain from Dunland!

81.
CONTINUED: (2)
ARAGORN
(urgently)
Hide!
BOROMIR
Merry..Pippin...Sam...take cover! WIDE
ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what
little cover
there is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at
Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark
shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is
heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the
south. Gandalf staggers to his feet.
GANDALF
(worried)
Spies of Saruman.
The passage South is
being watched.
Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing
towards a high mountain pass.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
We must take the pass of Caradhras!
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON:
The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. CLOSE ON: Frodo
slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring
falls on the ground... CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the
snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands,
the ring dangling before his eyes. He seems to grow in
stature, as if absorbing its power. Aragorn warily approaches
Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as
if transfixed.
ARAGORN
Boromir?
BOROMIR
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt over so
small a thing...such a little thing.
ARAGORN
(quietly)
Boromir...give the ring to Frodo.
ARAGORN'S HAND moves to his sword hilt.
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
Ring's POV...looking up at Boromir's face. The strange hum
vibrates on the soundtrack. CLOSE ON: a Weird beatific smile
lights up Boromir's face...The HUM grows to a Deafening roar!
Boromir suddenly snaps out of his trance and hands the ring
back to Frodo.
BOROMIR
(lightly)
As you wish. I care not.
Boromir smiles at Frodo, ruffling his hair. CLOSE ON: ARAGON
unhands his sword.
CUT TO:
Following the crows as they race deeper and deeper, passing a
vista of Industry, Hundreds of Orcs and writhing
Birthsacks...flying past Saruman, who stands upon a wooden
Gantry. CLOSE ON: Saruman, listening to the Cries of the
crows.
SARUMAN
So, Gandalf...you try to lead them over
Caradhras. And if that fails...where
then will you go? THE FELLOWSHIP
struggles through the snow.
SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
If the mountain defeats you, will you
risk a more dangerous road?
CUT TO:
THE FELLOWSHIP are struggling through a blinding blizzard, up
towards the PASS OF CARADHRAS. Legolas the Elf moves lightly
across the top of the snow...he suddenly pauses. Saruman's
voice sweeps by in the wind.
LEGOLAS
(urgent)
There is a fell voice in the air.
GANDALF
It's Saruman.
THUNDER RUMBLES...ROCK and Shale fall from above.
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
ARAGORN
(urgently)
He's trying to bring down the mountain.
Gandalf! We must turn back!
GANDALF
No!
GANDALF RAISES HIS STAFF...HE CHANTS INTO THE WIND.
GANDALF
(YELLING)
Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho I
ruith. Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie
still, hold your wrath.
CUT TO:
CAMERA SWEEPS PAST SARUMAN...he stands on the summit of
Orthanc, Chanting. CLOUDS ARE FLOWING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS...
converging on the distant mountains in a stormy Malestrom.
Saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship
like thunder. A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside
above them. Frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche
thunders down towards them! The Fellowship throw themselves
against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge.
LEGOLAS pulls Gandalf to safety. Aragorn shields Frodo and
Sam as snow piles around them. Within moments, the pass is
blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow. Boromir
and Aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits...who are pulled
out Shivering and Fearful.
BOROMIR
(urgent)
We must get off the mountain! Make for
the gap of Rohan and take the West road
to my city.
ARAGORN
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to
Isengard.
GIMLI
We cannot pass over the mountain. Let us
go under it. Let us go through the mines
of Moria. Gandalf has a concerned look on
his face.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
SARUMAN (V.O.)
Moria. You fear to go into those mines,
don't you? The dwarves delved too
greedily and too deep.
SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
You know what they awoke in, the darkness
of Khazad-dum. Shadow and flame.
GANDALF
Let the ringbearer decide.
CLOSE ON: FRODO, the weight of the decision weighing heavily
upon him. CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN shivering in Boromir's
arms.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Frodo?
Frodo meets Gandalf's eye.
FRODO
We will go through the mines. Gandalf
slowly nods.
GANDALF
So be it.
CUT TO:
The Fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark
lake...directly below great looming cliffs.
GIMLI
(in awe)
The walls of Moria!
Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and
greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between
the trees... slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of
luminous silver running through the stone.
GANDALF
Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and
moonlight.
A large moon rises over the mountains... The lines grow
Broader and Clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing
ancient letters and symbols.
(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF (CONT'D)
It reads, "The door of Durin, Lord of
Moria. Speak, friend, and enter."
MERRY
What do you suppose that means?
GANDALF
(confident)
It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
speak the password and the doors will
open.
Gandalf raises his arms...
GANDALF (CONT'D)
(incanting)
Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!
The cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, Frodo
shivers... and the door stands fast!
LATER:
GANDALF CONTINUES...
Mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door. Sam packs
pots and pans at his feet...watching sadly as Aragorn un-
saddles Bill the pony. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN whispering to Bill
the Pony.
ARAGORN
(whispering)
Mines are no place for a Pony, even one
so brave as Bill.
SAM
Bye, Bill.
ARAGORN
Go on, Bill, go on..don't worry, Sam...he
knows his way home. Aragorn slaps Bill on
the rump...Bill goes trotting off. CLOSE
ON: Sam watching Bill disappear into the
darkness.
SAM
Goodbye, Bill.
SPLASH! Merry and Pippin are tossing stones into the lake.
Black Rippling rings slowly fan out. Pippin is about to
throw another stone, but Aragorn grabs his arm.
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
ARAGORN
(ominous)
Do not disturb the water.
Aragorn watches anxiously as the Ripples appear to grow....he
exchanges a look with Boromir.
Aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword. Gandalf gives up in
despair...he sits down beside Frodo. Close on: Frodo peers at
the Elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of
comprehension.
FRODO
(quietly)
It's a riddle...
Gandalf raises his eyebrows...
FRODO (CONT'D)
(explaining)
Speak, friend, and enter.
What's the
Elvish for friend?
GANDALF
Oh...mellon.
With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and
two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness
deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness,
something in the water stirs....
Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous
Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him
towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush
forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls
him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20
more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils
as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the
creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is
flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature.
Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into
Boromir's arms.
GANDALF
Into the mines!
BOROMIR
Legolas!
Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a
few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of
the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from
the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many
Coiling arms seize the large doors.
The Fellowship tumble out of the Great Eastern Gate on to a
grassy sunlit hillside. Sam, Merry, and Pippin fall slowly to
the ground, Sobbing...Aragorn turns to Legolas and Gimli.
ARAGORN
(urgent)
Legolas, get them up!
BOROMIR
Give them a moment...for pity's sake!
ARAGORN
By nightfall these hills will be swarming
with Orcs! We must reach the woods of
Lothlorien. Come, Boromir, Legolas,
Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)
Boromir glances towards Frodo, then back
at Aragorn. Frodo is walking away, as if
in a daze.
ARAGORN (CONT'D)
Frodo?
Frodo!
CLOSE ON: FRODO SLOWLY TURNS...a look of numb shock on his
devastated face. The Fellowship marches on.
CUT TO:
Aragorn scours ahead of the company, as they stumble on in
the fading light...in the distance the shimmer of a large
forest can be seen...Lothlorien!
WIDE ON: The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with
yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by
silver pillars...the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks
nervously around...
GIMLI
Stay close, young hobbits..they say a
Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf-
witch of terrible power. All who look
upon her fall under her spell...
Frodo hesitates...a STRANGE VOICE whispers in his head...
GALADRIEL (V.O.)
Frodo...
GIMLI
And are never seen again!
GALADRIEL (V.O.)
...your coming to us is as the footsteps
of doom. You bring great evil here,
Ringbearer.
SAM
Mr. Frodo?
GIMLI
Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare
so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and
the ears of a fox!
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES.
Deadly arrows aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the Elvish
captain steps forward... he looks at Gimli with disdain.
HALDIR
The dwarf breathes so loud we could have
shot him in the dark.
ARAGORN
(Elvish: with subtitles)
Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your
help. We need your protection.
GIMLI
Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We
should go back.
HALDIR
You have entered the realm of the Lady of
the Wood. You cannot go back.
Haldir's eyes lock onto Frodo.
HALDIR (CONT'D)
Come, she is waiting.
CUT TO:
Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top.
They look with
wonderment at the vista spread before them.
Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of
the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees,
taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the
mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of
the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east
of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale
gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land
appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,
it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies
on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie
beyond.
CUT TO:
Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a
pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on
soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL
SINGING drifts down from the trees above.
LEGOLAS
(sadly)
A lament for Gandalf...
MERRY
What do they say about him?
LEGOLAS
I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
the grief is still too near. Boromir is
sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.
ARAGORN
Take some rest..these borders are well
protected.
Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face.
Aragorn kneels down beside him.
BOROMIR
I will find no rest here. I heard her
voice inside my head...she spoke of my
father and the fall of Gondor, and she
said to me: "Even now, there
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
is hope left. But I cannot see it...it
is long since we had any hope.
CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair.
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
My father is a noble man, but his rule is
failing and our..our people lose faith.
He looks to me to make things right...and
I would do it, I would see the glory of
Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
glimmering like a spike of pearl and
silver, its banners caught high in the
morning breeze...have you ever been
called home by the clear ringing of
silver trumpets?
ARAGORN
I have seen the white city..long ago.
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED:
Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes
heart,
BOROMIR
One day our paths will lead us there, and
the tower guards shall take up the call
"the Lords of Gondor have returned."
Aragorn returns Boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet
sadness only when Boromir looks away.
CUT TO:
LATER....
The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Gimli is snoring
loudly. CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the
lawn. CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by
instinct. GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the
moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her...as if drawn by
an invisible force.
CUT TO:
Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits
a shallow Silver Basin. Galadriel leads Frodo into the small
Glade.
GALADRIEL
Will you look into the mirror? Frodo
looks with apprehension at the silver
basin.
FRODO
(warily)
What will I see?
Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a
glow rises from the water.
GALADRIEL
Even the wisest cannot tell for the
mirror shows many things...things that
were ..things that are...and some things
that have not yet come to pass.
Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers
into the
glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into
the water...
suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure
of an old
man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long
road. Frodo
leans closer to the mirror's surface...
103.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO!
FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.
FRODO
(joyous)
Gandalf!
Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo
reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.
Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision
shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The
image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings
burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting
and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party
tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to
grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing
him entirely.
IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields
and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching
smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the
Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot-
stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-
hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black
abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable
to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches
above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire
erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself
away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light
instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his
senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue,
unmoved, untouched by the horror.
GALADRIEL
I know what it is you saw...for it is
also in my mind. It is the future,
Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
you should fail.
Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in
his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at
Galadriel.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
The fellowship is breaking. It has
already begun. He will try to take the
ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
one, it will destroy them all.
FRODO (V.O.)
If you ask it of me, I will give you the
One Ring.
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
GALADRIEL
You offer it to me freely...I do not deny
that my heart has greatly desired this.
Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's
eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the
Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
the earth...all shall love me and
despair! Frodo takes a step away from
Galadriel...
Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more,
clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
(gently)
I pass the test.
(laughs)
I will diminish and go into the west and
remain Galadriel. Frodo's confidence
drains away.
FRODO
I cannot do this alone...
GALADRIEL
You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear
a ring of power is to be alone. This task
was appointed to you, and if you do not
find a way, no one will.
Frodo realizes what her message is.
FRODO
Then I know what I must do. It's
just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel
kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at
him intently.
GALADRIEL
Even the smallest person can change the
course of the future.
The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close
over it.
CUT TO:
105.
Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast,
their powerful legs carrying them at speed.
The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from
the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves
quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small
Crystal Phial.
GALADRIEL
Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
light of Earendil, our most beloved star.
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone,
watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo
still hears her voice...
GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
May it be a light for you in dark places,
when all other lights go out.
The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven
boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees
slowly give way to a brown and withered land.
The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly
purpose.
A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale
sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.
The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky
gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly
paddling in the stern.
ARAGORN
(quietly)
Frodo.
Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide
on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot
pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of
Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power
and majesty.
ARAGORN (CONT'D)
The Argonath...
Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the
silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.
ARAGORN (CONT'D)
(deeply moved)
Long have I desired to look upon the
kings of old...my kin.
The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes
them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.
(CONTINUED)
107.
CONTINUED:
Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to
reveal a large lake only a mile down river...
ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP
As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.
ARAGORN
We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
boats and continue on foot..we approach
Mordor from the North.
GIMLI
(gloomy)
Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
after that gets even better...a
festering, stinking marshland, far as the
eye can see.
ARAGORN
That is our Road...I suggest you take
some rest and recover your strength,
Master Dwarf.
GIMLI
(indignant)
Recover my...
Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.
LEGOLAS
We should leave now.
ARAGORN
No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
must wait for cover of darkness.
LEGOLAS
It is not the Eastern shore that worries
me.
Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...
LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
A shadow and a threat has been growing in
my mind. Something draws near, I can
feel it.
(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED:
Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means.
Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling
at Gimli's feet...
MERRY
Where's Frodo?
Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his
eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp
bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!
Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND!
Frodo freezes....
BOROMIR
(quietly)
None of us should wander alone; you least
of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?
Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
I know why you seek solitude. You
suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
sure you do not suffer needlessly?
Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be
heard
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
Let me help you. There are other ways,
Frodo..other paths that we might take.
FRODO
I know what you would say, and it would
seem like wisdom but for the warning of
my heart.
BOROMIR
Warning?
Against what?
Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself
up.
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
fear drive us to destroy what hope we
have...don't you see that is madness?
FRODO
There is no other way.
BOROMIR
I ask only for the strength to defend my
people.
(angrily drops the wood he has
collected)
If you would but lend me the ring...
FRODO
No. . .
Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.
BOROMIR
Why do you recoil?
I am no thief.
FRODO
(wary)
You are not yourself.
BOROMIR
What chance do you think you have? They
will find you, they will take the ring
and you will beg for death before the
end.
Frodo turns to leave.
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
You fool! It is not yours save by
unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
me the ring.
Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo
has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.
FRODO DISAPPEARS
Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into
thin air!
BOROMIR
I see your mind...you will take the ring
to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
your death and the death of us all.

Curse you! Curse you and your Halflings!
Boromir stumbles and falls. His body
shakes as if in the Throes of a
fit...slowly he comes to.
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
(Disoriented)
Frodo! Frodo! What have I done. Please,
Frodo...
IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:
FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy
shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's
distraught voice carries from another dimension:
BOROMIR (O.S.)
I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...
Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone
pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the
throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around
him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to
shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope
towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of
holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from
Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships
sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in
motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes
against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills
Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,
tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!
SUDDENLY!
SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF
LIGHT.
SAURON (V.O.)
(IN BLACK SPEECH)
They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down
the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,
seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring
off his finger...
Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.
111.
AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!
Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.
ARAGORN
Frodo?
FRODO
(numb)
It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves
towards Frodo...
ARAGORN
(urgent)
Where is the ring?
Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the
movement.
FRODO
Stay away!
ARAGORN
Frodo...I swore to protect you.
FRODO
Can you protect me from yourself?
Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It
glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.
FRODO (CONT'D)
Would you destroy it?
ARAGORN
(kneeling to Frodo)
I would have gone with you to the end...
into the very fires of Mordor.
FRODO
I know...Look after the others,
especially Sam...he will not understand.
Aragorn freezes!
He draws his sword.
ARAGORN
(urgent)
Go, Frodo!
Frodo hesitates.
(CONTINUED)
112.
CONTINUED:
ARAGORN (CONT'D)
(yells)
Run! Run!!
Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto
Amon Hen behind Aragorn!
Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he
brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as
others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,
away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst
the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he
is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into
the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.
Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet
thunder down behind him.
SAM
Mr. Frodo!
Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his
URUKS.
LURTZ
Find the Halflings ... find the
halflings!
Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a
tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the
forest rings out.
MERRY (O.S.)
(urgent whisper)
Frodo!
Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few
feet away.
MERRY (CONT'D)
Hide here, quick!
PIPPIN
Come on...
Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great
sadness in his eyes...
PIPPIN (CONT'D)
What's he doing?
(CONTINUED)
113.
CONTINUED:
Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.
Understanding.
MERRY
(softly)
He's leaving.
PIPPIN
No!
Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at
his arm.
MERRY
Pippin!
THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and
Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards
the lake.
LEGOLAS
The horn of Gondor!
ARAGORN
Boromir!
Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling
URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear
guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he
tries to protect Merry and Pippin...
BOROMIR
Run!
Run!
Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's
chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another
arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and
Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.
MERRY & PIPPIN
Aaaaagh!
Boromir! Boromir!
Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn
charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock
into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races
towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI
arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI
lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven
in two.
BOROMIR
(painful gasp)
They took the little ones...
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
114.
CONTINUED: (2)
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
Aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow
of Blood from Boromir's shoulder.
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
(panicked)
Frodo...where is Frodo?
ARAGORN
I let Frodo go.
Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.
BOROMIR
Then you did what I could not.
I tried
to take the ring from him.
ARAGORN
The ring is beyond our reach now.
BOROMIR
Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed
you all.
ARAGORN
No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to
bind Boromir's wound.
BOROMIR
Leave it! It is over...the world of Men
will fall and all will come to darkness
and my city to ruin..Aragorn..
ARAGORN
I do not know what strength is in my
blood, but I swear to you... I will not
let the White City fall, nor your people
fail...
BOROMIR
Our people...our people...
Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.
Boromir's
fingers tighten around the hilt.
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
I would have followed you, my
brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn
lays Boromir down. He is dead.
ARAGORN
Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends
and Kisses Boromir's forehead.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED: (3)
ARAGORN (CONT'D)
Legolas and Gimli appear behind
him...Aragorn stands.
ARAGORN (CONT'D)
They will look for his coming from the
white tower...but he will not return.
On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish
Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as
hard as he can through the forest...
SAM
Mr. Frodo!
Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the
camera moves in on the ring.
FRODO (V.O.)
I wish the ring had never come to me..I
wish none of this had happened...
Tears fall down Frodo's face...
GANDALF (V.O.)
So do all who lie to see such times...but
that is not for them to decide. All we
have to decide is what to do with the
time that is given us.
With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his
vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish
boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs
toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.
SAM
(anguished)
Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in
the boat, paddling steadfastly away from
the
shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on the
wind. Frodo whispers to himself
FRODO
No, Sam.
Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.
SPLASH!
FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the
water.
(CONTINUED)
116.
CONTINUED:
FRODO (CONT'D)
Go back,Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.
Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.
SAM
Of course you are...and I'm coming with
you!
FRODO
You can't swim.
Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...
FRODO (CONT'D)
(frightened)
Sam!
Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.
SAM
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.
(fierce passion)
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
(sobs)
And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.
FRODO
(crying)
Oh, Sam!
Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.
FRODO (CONT'D)
Come on then..
The two Hobbits row through the water...
Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing
water...Boromir's body slides under camera.
He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his
chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat
drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls
of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.
(CONTINUED)
117.
CONTINUED:
LEGOLAS
If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
Sam before nightfall.
Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small
Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and
Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react.
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.
LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
You mean not to follow them...
ARAGORN
Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.
GIMLI
Then it has all been in vain...the
fellowship has failed.
ARAGORN
Not if we hold true to each other. We
will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
torment and death, not while we have
strength left.
Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it
on.
ARAGORN (CONT'D)
Leave all that can be spared behind...
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his
eye.
ARAGORN (CONT'D)
(grimly)
We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.
GIMLI
Yes!
Ha!
Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods,
following the URUK-HAI trail.
Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.
A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the
mountains....MORDOR!
(CONTINUED)
118.
CONTINUED:
FRODO
Mordor!
I hope the others find a safer
road.
SAM
(simply)
Strider'll look after them.
FRODO
I don't suppose we'll ever see them
again.
SAM
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.
We may.
FRODO
Sam?
Frodo looks at Sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, Sam is undeterred...
FRODO (CONT'D)
I'm glad you're with me.
