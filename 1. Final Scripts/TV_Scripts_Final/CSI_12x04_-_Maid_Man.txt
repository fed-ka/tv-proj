                                      TEASER

  OVER BLACK:

  As the WEEPING ORGAN -- of CSI's version of THE GODFATHER
  theme -- creeps in...  PHOTOS OF THE TEN GREATEST MOB BOSSES
  (AKA "THE BOSS OF FAME") flash on the screen:  


1INT. ND LOCATION - NIGHT1

    ACCARDO.  LUCCHESE.  GENOVESE.  COSTELLO.  LUCIANO.  BONANNO. *
    SPILOTRO.  GOTTI.  GEDDA.  CAPONE. 

  HOLD on the CAPONE PHOTO.  He's in a crispy suit, holding a
    baseball bat over his shoulder, smile-biting a cigar, until --


2VFX SHOT - AL CAPONE, IN THE PHOTO, COMES TO LIFE2

    swinging his bat at the CAMERA, actually WHACKING IT a few
    times, before literally stepping out of the photo and onto -- 


3INT. NATIONAL MOB MUSEUM   FOYER - NIGHT 3

    BRIGHT VEGAS-COLORED CARPET

  AL CAPONE in the photo has now transformed into a GUY in an
  AL CAPONE COSTUME, bat and cigar included.  As our Al Capone 
    continues to swing the bat, PULL BACK to REVEAL we're in -- 

  THE MOB MUSEUM'S FOYER

  An old post office, converted to a courthouse, converted to*
  a MOB MUSEUM.  The GRAND OPENING underway.  A BLOOD RED CARPET*
  leads into a packed foyer, clogged with PAPARAZZI and
    REPORTERS. 

  Our Al Capone is one of several COSTUMED GANGSTERS, actors
    dressed in mob outfits, entertaining the black ties of Vegas'
    elite: CELEBRITIES, CASINO EXECS, POLITICIANS, MOB FAMILIES,
  and LAW ENFORCEMENT. 


4INT. MOB MUSEUM - "THE BOSS OF FAME" EXHIBIT - NIGHT4

    RUSSELL and ECKLIE, wearing their best black, sipping bubbly,
    browse the glass enclosed exhibits.  Mannequins, to exact
    specification of the real mob bosses, are dressed in their
  real clothing, surrounded by real personal items.

                  Ellis Island to Brooklyn, Chicago,
                  Kansas City... finally Vegas.  Ticket
                to the American Dream.

                                    ECKLIE
                My Great Grandfather came here from
                  Wales.  He didn't become a gangster. 
                He drove a bread truck. 

    Russell squints at a placard on the Lou Gedda display case --

                                    RUSSELL
                        (reads aloud)
                  Weapons and personal items on loan
                  from the Las Vegas Police Department.
                        (looks up to Ecklie)*
                  That's one way to clear the evidence*
                  vault.*

  OFF Ecklie's look...*


5INT. MOB MUSEUM - FOYER - NIGHT  5*

  MOB LAWYER (and FORMER MAYOR) OSCAR GOODMAN escorts his wife
  (and NEW MAYOR) CAROLYN GOODMAN off the blood red carpet,
  into the mic of a local FEMALE REPORTER --  

                                    FEMALE REPORTER
                Mr. and Mrs. Mayor, great opening. 
                But you've taken heat from Italian
                  American groups accusing you of
                  stereotyping.  Any comment? 

                                  OSCAR GOODMAN
                We didn't call it the 'Guido Museum'*
                did we?  Mobsters come in all*
                  flavors.  Equal opportunity employer.


6INT. MOB MUSEUM - "THE BOSS OF FAME" EXHIBIT - NIGHT 6

    CAMERA FINDS CATHERINE and GREG, also in their best black
  and sipping bubbly, checking out the Spilotro exhibit. Greg
  eyes a 70's era photo of a YOUNG SAM BRAUN with Spilotro.

                                  GREG
                    Congratulations.
                        (off her look)
                  Oscar put your Dad in the Spilotro
                  exhibit.  

                                    CATHERINE
                  Forgot how handsome he was.

                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Maid Man" - 1204 - WHITE - 8/23/113.

                                    RUSSELL (O.S.)
                  I can see the family resemblance.

  They turn to see Russell walking up.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Goodfella's daughter turns CSI. 
                  Story writes itself.

                                    CATHERINE
                Sam wasn't a goodfella -- 

                                  GREG
                -- He was a playfella.  When a
                  goodfella wanted to party, Sam was
                the go-to-guy.  Provided the women,
                the favors, security.  Those same
                  goodfellas hired him to run their
                  casinos.  Connected, but no killer.    

    Catherine lays a friendly pat on Greg's chest.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Nice spin, Greg. 
                        (looks around)
                  Sam.  A lot of these guys.  They
                  were no angels.  But family came
                  first.  And they knew how to provide.

                                  GREG
                No joke.  Her dad gave her a casino. 
                  I didn't even get the family wagon.  

                                    CATHERINE
                        (to Russell)
                You here with your wife?

                                    RUSSELL
                My work wife.  Ecklie.

  Just then, Greg's eyes light up as he looks over Catherine's
    shoulder, noticing --

  Three attractive and sexy MOB WIDOWS.  Formerly married to
  the mob.  DIANA MELI (50's).  STEPHANIE GREENBERG (50's). 
  And JOANNA SAPPHIRE (40's).  All flaunting stilletos and
    jewelry from the good ol' days as if they were new.  

                                  GREG
                          (whispers)
                  Guys, over there.  

                                    RUSSELL
                Why are you whispering, Greg?


                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Maid Man" - 1204 - WHITE - 8/23/114.*

6CONTINUED:  (2)6

                                  GREG
                Out of respect.  For the pack of
                mob widows.  Mrs. Tony 'Revolvers'
                  Meli.  Mrs. Vinnie 'Whack Job'*
                  Sapphire.  And Mrs. Stu "Greenbacks'
                  Greenberg.  Together.  Unbelievable. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  Why?

                                  GREG
                  'Whack Job' was Lou Gedda's hitman. 
                  Whacked 'Greenbacks' outside his
                own diamond anniversary party. 
                  Popped Meli while he was at the
                  cardiologist.  

                                    RUSSELL
                And 'Whack Job'?

                                    CATHERINE
                Got arrested for all that whacking. 
                  Jumped bail.  No one's seen him in*
                  twenty years.    *

                                    RUSSELL
                  Nice to see the wives have stayed
                in touch.

  Just then, RAT-A-TAT-TAT!  A burst of MACHINE GUN FIRE rings
  out.  But it's not a machine gun, it's a drum roll for the
    Goodmans, who approach the PODIUM, flanked by TWO COSTUMED
    GANGSTERS, "firing" TOMMY GUNS.

    SHERIFF SHERRY LISTON and Ecklie follow behind.  Neither*
  happy to be here.  Sheriff Liston leans into Ecklie --  *

                                    SHERIFF LISTON*
                  Little uncomfortable coming to a
                  celebration of mobsters.*

                                    ECKLIE
                  Like it or not, they're the founding
                  fathers of Vegas.

  Crowd gathers around the podium where Goodman stands.

                                  OSCAR GOODMAN
                  Thank you all for coming.  My thanks
                to my wife, the current Mayor
                  Goodman.  And Sheriff Liston for*
                her support.

  As Sheriff Liston puts on her game face --*

6CONTINUED:  (3)6

                                  OSCAR GOODMAN
                  When I was running for Mayor, the
                  advice I got was -- don't talk about
                  your past.  Or how many wiseguys*
                you defended.  I said to hell with
                  that and got elected three times.   
                You don't run away from your past. 
                You honor it.  Salud! --*

  Oscar raises his martini glass for a toast as the costumed*
    Gangsters fire off a "Mob" salute.  RAT-A-TAT-TAT!  Followed
    quickly by LOUDER GUNSHOTS.  BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG!  Until --  *

    Oscar's martini glass shatters, drops from his hand as he *
    recoils and collapses to the floor, HITTING his head.  BANG-
  BANG!  More shots, one on top of the other, as PANDEMONIUM
    breaks out --

    Ecklie dives, covering Oscar.  Sees a BULLET HOLE torn through
  his suit.  

                                    ECKLIE
                Mr. Mayor, you okay?  You with me?

                                  OSCAR GOODMAN
                        (out of it, groaning)
                  Think I got a busted rib.  

                                    ECKLIE
                  You've been shot.  Just lie still.
                        (then, to Uniforms)

7INT. MOB MUSEUM   NEAR THE PODIUM - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)7

  Crime scene.  Detectives and Unis herd the the last of the
    CROWD, among them the Mob widows, into the lobby.  As Sheriff
    Liston, flanked by a UNIFORM, approaches Ecklie --*

                                    SHERIFF LISTON*
                  Attempt on the life of the former
                  Mayor.  My ass is hanging out here. 
                You better solve this quick.

                                    ECKLIE
                  Loud and clear, ma'am.

  As the Sheriff and her UNIFORM exit, Ecklie crosses through
  the chaos to... Russell, Catherine and Greg, by the podium.

                                    ECKLIE
                  They just rolled the Mayor into the
                  E.R.  Looks like he's going to be
                  okay.

                                  GREG
                          (vindicated)
                  See, told you.  'Hit' in a mob
                  museum?  Had to be a publicity stunt. 

                                    ECKLIE
                If the former mayor was going to
                  stage his own 'assassination', I
                  would've known about it.  And I
                  would've told him no.

                                    CATHERINE
                So, I guess he was lucky tonight.

    Ecklie gets a cell call, answers --

                                    ECKLIE
                        (on cell)
                  Ecklie... Yeah, I'm here.  How 'bout
                the Sheriff does the press conference
                  this time?...

  As Ecklie walks off to argue his case...

                                    RUSSELL
                        (head in the game)
                  I heard four shots.  Relatively close. 
                To the east of the podium.

    Russell heads to where he thinks the shots came from.  Weaves
    through several EXHIBIT CASES and DISPLAY WALLS, finally
    arriving at an area that has a clear shot of the podium. 
  But off to the side.  On the floor, he sees a CHROME REVOLVER.  

                                    RUSSELL
                38 Colt Service Revolver.

    Russell takes his INVITATION out of his pocket, folds it in
  half, making an instant marker, lays it next to the gun,
  then pulls a HANDKERCHIEF off a FREE-STANDING MANNEQUIN,
  picks up the gun with it.  He rolls the cylinder open to
    reveal FOUR FIRED CARTRIDGE CASES and TWO LIVE ROUNDS.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Four rounds fired.  

                                  GREG
                  Just like the real mobsters.  Dump
                  your piece, then peace out.

                          (recalling)
                As Oscar was going down, I heard
                  more shots.  Coming from back there.

    Russell and Catherine turn to the the back of the museum.

                                    RUSSELL
                ... Other side of the room.
                        (then)
                  Greg, get your kit.  Start processing
                out from the podium.  'Casino Boss',
                  let's take a walk.

  As Greg nods and hustles off, Russell and Catherine head for -- 


8INT. MOB MUSEUM - BACK OF EXHIBIT HALL - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)8

    Russell and Catherine approach the LOU GEDDA EXHIBIT.  It's
  shot to shit.  DICED GLASS and memorabilia litter the floor.
  TWO BULLET WOUNDS in the Lou Gedda mannequin.  Gedda's tipped
  back against his infamous BARBER CHAIR.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Somebody shot Lou Gedda.  Again.

                                    RUSSELL
                Two bullets in him.  Glass broken
                on both sides.  Could be a shot or
                two got through.

    Russell looks through the shot up exhibit, diced safety glass
  on both side of the case.  He squints, "lines" up the shot --

                                    RUSSELL
                  Mayor was at the podium.  Not the
                  best shot in the house.

                                    CATHERINE
                But maybe the best cover.  

  She moves from behind the mannequin to a catering cart, grabs
    a PLASTIC KNIFE, snaps it in half.  Steps back over the broken
    glass, onto the exhibit platform, where she uses the blunt
  edges of both halves of the knife to pry a BULLET from Gedda.  

                                    CATHERINE
                  Looks like a 38.  

                                    RUSSELL
                  Shots fired at the front of the
                  room.  And here in the back.  Same
                  time, same caliber.  Two shooters.

                If they went out the front door, we
                  would've seen them.

  OFF Russell, looking toward the rear exit --


9EXT. MOB MUSEUM   BACK ALLEY   NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)9

    Russell and Catherine exit the rear door, see a DEAD SECURITY
  GUARD (STANLEY GANT, 40's) lying on the concrete.  There's a
  BIG BULLET HOLE where the Guard's nose used to be. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  Body.  Museum security.  

    Russell checks his pulse, dead.  Catherine notes his empty
    holster.  Spots a 38 REVOLVER a few feet away.  Picks it up,
  using her SHAWL, swings the cylinder open --

                                    CATHERINE
                Got two shots off.  Before he snorted
                  a bullet.  

    Russell, back on his feet, now eyes a pair of TIRE IMPRESSIONS
  in the nearby trickle of water, running down the alley.  

                                    RUSSELL
                  Tire impressions in water.  Better
                  snap before they dry up.

    Improvising L-scale, he lays a DOLLAR BILL down beside the
    treads and snaps a PHOTO of the impressions with his iPHONE,
  then angles it up at Catherine.  CLICK.

                                    CATHERINE
                  What are you doing?

                                    RUSSELL
                          (innocent appreciation)
                You look great in this light. 
                        (then)
                  C'mon, tell me you're not gonna
                  want to remember the night they
                  shot Oscar Goodman.

  OFF Catherine, moonbeamed again.

                                                                            SMASH TO:

10INT. ECLIPSE CASINO - PENTHOUSE FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY10

  Six a.m.  NICK and MORGAN, kits in hand, head down the hall.  

                                    MORGAN
                  Someone tries to kill the former
                  mayor and we're here.  What do you
                  have to do to pull the primo cases?

                                  NICK
                Ask me, they're all primo.  And you
                  pulled a good partner.

                                    MORGAN
                  You, too.

  They swap a smile as they pass a MAID'S CART, fully stocked. 
  In the B.G., UNIFORMS with the HEAD OF HOUSEKEEPING (45),
  and PAULETTE VASQUEZ (28), housekeeper.  Also, several other
  HOTEL STAFF being held for questioning.  FOLLOW Nick and
    Morgan into --  


11INT. ECLIPSE CASINO - PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)  11

    Pretty poshy as suites go.  And pretty wrecked.  Trashed.
    Somebody was partying like a rock star -- empty cocktail and
    champagne glasses, bottles, ashtrays, white residue on the
  glass table tops.  As Nick clocks the coke residue and they
  take in the scene --

                                  NICK
                  Somebody had a good time.

                                  BRASS (O.S.)
                And somebody didn't.

  Nick and Morgan turn to see BRASS at the bedroom door.  They
  join him in --


12INT. ECLIPSE CASINO - PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)12

  -- where a maid, MARIA GARZA (35), lies on the floor near
  the bed.  A COCKTAIL STIRRER jammed in one eye, thin trickle*
  of blood down her cheek to a dime-sized pool on the floor. *
  DAVID PHILLIPS kneeling beside her, taking her liver temp.*

                                  BRASS
                  Maria Garza.  Housekeeper assigned
                to this suite. If she was a
                  bartender, I'd say someone didn't
                  like their martini.

12CONTINUED:12

  Nick and Morgan look around.  King bed is unmade. Louis
    Vuitton bags, men's Gucci suits, Zegna sportswear, etc.,
    scattered carelessly.  Towels and dirty clothes on the floor. 
    Morgan eyes Nick --

                                    MORGAN
                  People are pigs.

                                  BRASS
                Got that right.  
                        (then)
                  Mrs. Garza worked midnight to eight. 
                  Head of Housekeeping found her when
                she failed to take her union break.

  David pulls out the liver stick and reads it --

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                  Ninety-four point one.  Dead roughly
                  three hours.

                                  NICK
                  Puts T.O.D. around three a.m.

                                    MORGAN
                  Who's the suite registered to? 

                                  BRASS
                        (re: notes)
                  Prince Jalal Najib.  *

                                    MORGAN
                  Rapper?  East coast or west coast?

                                  BRASS
                  More Middle East.

  Just then, Brass' cell RINGS.  He answers --

                                  BRASS
                  Brass... Be right there.
                          (clicks off, then)
                My Prince awaits.  At the tables.
                  Practice my curtsey in the elevator. 

  As Brass exits --

                                    MORGAN
                  Guessing this is a first, Dave?

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                  First what?

                                  GREG
                  Haven't found any other bullets.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Probably find them in the Mayor. 

                                  GREG
                  That's what I'm thinking.  I mean,
                he was shot from two directions. 
                  Where's all the blood?  When you
                get shot, you bleed.  Unless mayors
                  don't bleed. 

    Russell gets behind the podium, stands where Mayor Goodman
  was standing, putting himself in the POV OF THE VICTIM.  He
  looks to his left, in the area he found the .38 Colt.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Four shots came from my left.  One
                  finishes off my champagne... 

  He mimics the 'glass' shattering in his hand --

                                    RUSSELL
                ... Then, three more direct hits.  

    Russell takes THREE MORE PHANTOM BULLETS to his chest.

                You plan on staying down there for
                  a while?

                                  GREG
                No damage to the podium.     

    Russell and Greg look around, then to each other.

  Oscar Goodman, in a hospital gown, reading the morning
    newspapers.  He likes what he sees.

                  Obituary can wait.  I made the front
                  page.  Both papers.

                                    RUSSELL
                Who made your suit?

                  Custom job.  Got a tailor in Bogota.

                I'm guessing your suit comes with a
                  lifetime guarantee.

                                  OSCAR GOODMAN
                  Which is why I'll need it back.

                                  OSCAR GOODMAN  
                Not afraid, just prepared.  Hell, I
                was Mayor for twelve years.  You
                  don't get everybody's vote.  And
                  before that, I helped wiseguys with
                  their legal troubles.  Couldn't get
                all of them off.

                                    RUSSELL
                So, you have a lot of enemies?

                                  OSCAR GOODMAN
                  Which is why I got to be bulletproof,
                  baby.  And, you got work to do.

25INT. ECLIPSE - PENTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)25

    Morgan exits the suite with an evidence box, notices Paulette
    Vasquez, the other housekeeper, crying in the doorway of the
  suite across the hall, which is being used by the cops to
    interview potential witnesses, hence the milling cops.

    Morgan sets down the box, walks past the dead maid's cart
    (still in the hall), and heads into --


26INT. ECLIPSE - SECOND PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)26

    Morgan approaches Paulette.  Several UNIS in the BG.

                                    MORGAN
                CSI Brody.  Ma'am, are you okay?

                                    PAULETTE VASQUEZ
                No.  Maria was my friend.  We worked
                  together almost six years.   

                                    MORGAN
                So you knew her well?

                                    PAULETTE VASQUEZ
                        (nods)
                She was a good, kind person.  Her
                  husband lost his job.  She's been
                  supporting him.  Four kids.

    Paulette appears shaken.  Overcome by the events.

                                    MORGAN
                  Were you working on this floor last
                  night?

                                    PAULETTE VASQUEZ
                  Yes.  Here. 

                                    MORGAN
                  Just across the hall.  Did you hear
                  anything?  A scream?  A fight?

                                    PAULETTE VASQUEZ
                        (eyes Maria's suite)
                No.  It was too loud.  The party.    

                                    MORGAN
                Did Maria go into the suite during
                the party?

    Paulette has a nervous vibe.

                  It's okay.  Don't be afraid.  I
                  just want to help Maria's family.

                                    PAULETTE VASQUEZ
                He was very demanding.

                The Prince?

    Paulette nods, then --

                                    PAULETTE VASQUEZ
                  He's here a lot.  Always the same
                  suite.  Always asks for Maria. 
                  There were nights when he would
                  call her ten, twenty times.  

                                    MORGAN
                For what?

  More nervousness.  Paulette seems afraid to answer.

                                    MORGAN
                Did the Prince ever make
                  inappropriate demands on Maria?

                                    PAULETTE VASQUEZ
                  Maria wouldn't say.  She never
                  complained.  Like me, she was just
                  grateful to have a job. 

  OFF Morgan, getting a bad feeling --

                                    MORGAN
                  I think our Prince was no prince
                  when it came to demanding extra
                  services from the maid.   

                                  NICK
                Of the sexual variety?

                                    MORGAN
                  Signs point that way.

                                  NICK
                  So's this camera.

  Nick eyes the LIPSTICK CAMERA.  As he angles his light across
    a SERIAL NUMBER --

                                  NICK
                  Somebody's been taking home movies.

30INT. CORONER'S OFFICE - AUTOPSY ROOM "A" - DAY30

    A KNIFE comes down on a human brain, slicing laterally, from
    ear-to-ear, like a loaf of bread, as WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL
  DR. ROBBINS doing the honors.  Nearby, the post-y, Stanley
  Gant, Museum Security Guard.  Skull cap off, brain out. 
    Catherine enters. 

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  I hear I almost had the Mayor on my
                  table.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Sorry, Doc.  Not his time.

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Don't be sorry.  I voted for him.
                  Three times.  Four if you count his
                  wife.  He's done great things for
                  this town.

  Dr. Robbins continues to slice the brain --

                                    CATHERINE
                How 'bout you do something for me. 
                        (back to business)
                  I can guess COD -- gunshot wound to
                the nose.  Anything else interesting?

  Dr. Robbins stops slicing, pulls back the vic's scalp and
  face to reveal SOOTING and STIPPLING surrounding his washed
    demolished nose.

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Sooting, stippling, lead smoke around
                the entry wound.  Shooter was less
                  than a foot away.

                                    CATHERINE
                          (thinking aloud)
                  Maybe the guard almost caught him.

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Well, he definitely caught a bullet.

  Dr. Robbins returns to the last portion of the brain,
    following the bullet track with his fingers.

  CLOSE ON: DR. ROBBINS' TWO FINGERS dive into the wound track
  and pull out a LARGE DEFORMED MASS OF LEAD.  

                                    CATHERINE
                  Another 38, I presume.  To add to
                my growing collection.

  Dr. Robbins gives the bullet a closer look -- 

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Your 38 put on some weight.

  He hands the bullet to Catherine.  She checks the base.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Looks like a 44.  Great. Can't wait
                to tell Ecklie... we've got three
                  shooters!

                She was your maid.  At the hotel. 
                  Maria Garza.  All those messes you
                  made, she cleaned them up.

                  You're talking about the hired help.  

  Under this, Morgan KNOCKS and enters, with a print kit. 
    Disgust for the Prince on her face.  Brass gives a nod.

                                  BRASS
                  Hotel security told me about your
                  little party last night.  Got so
                  good, they shut it down.  Just after
                  two.  Where'd you go for your 'after
                  party'?

                                    PRINCE JALAL*
                The pool.  From there, I went to
                the casino.  Where you found me.

    Morgan has laid out a TEN CARD, PRINT MATERIALS and SWABS.

                                  BRASS
                  This is CSI Brody --

                                    MORGAN
                        (cuts him off)
                -- I'm hired to take your prints. 
                And DNA.

                                    PRINCE JALAL*
                  Didn't I see you at the Marquee Day
                  Club yesterday?  Topless, yes.

                                  BRASS
                  Lose the watch.  And jewelry.

                                    PRINCE JALAL*
                          (dismissive, to Brass)
                Do you have a male assistant?

  Brass is about to answer, but sees Morgan's face -- this is
  going to be good.

                                    MORGAN
                If it'll make it any easier for
                  you, you can give me a thousand
                  bucks after we finish.

  The Prince stares daggers.  She stares right back.  Finally,
  he caves.  Removes his jewelry, hands it over -- including a
    Rolex, which Morgan clocks -- as she takes out a swab.

                                    MORGAN 
                  Open up.  

  OFF the Prince's look, as he opens his mouth --

                                                                                CUT TO:

  The CANNON FIRES!  Then, BANG!  CSI: "Maid Man" - 1204 - WHITE - 8/23/1122.


36INT. CSI - BALLISTICS - DAY 36

                                    XIOMARA GARCIA
                Una mas!  

    XIOMARA GARCIA, gleaming eyes, ears protected, shoots the
  .38 COLT (dumped at the scene) into the tank.  BANG!

                                    XIOMARA GARCIA
                All you cowards can come out from
                  under your desks!

  As she takes off her eye and ears, HODGES passes by. Gives
  her look, then --

                                    HODGES
                  Like your job much?

                                    XIOMARA GARCIA
                You don't like what you see?

                                    HODGES
                  A woman holding heat?  Hot.  Aimed
                at me.  Not. 

  As she collects the BULLETS from the water tank --

                                    XIOMARA GARCIA
                  Want to grab a beer after shift?  

                                    HODGES
                          (intimidated)
                  Okay.  Public place.  And I have a
                no carry rule on the first date.  

                                    XIOMARA GARCIA
                  I always carry.

                                    HODGES
                  Rain check.  

    Hodges moves off.  Xiomara smiles, crosses to the COMPARISON
    SCOPE.  She mounts the test fire bullet on the right stage. 
  Then, she picks up an envelope labelled:  PODIUM BULLET. 
  Puts it on the left stage.  As she looks in the eyepiece --


37INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY37

  Nick, FILE in hand, intercepts Morgan --

                                  NICK
                  Maria Garza's autopsy showed no
                  signs of vaginal trauma.  S.A.E.
                kit was negative for semen.

37CONTINUED:37

                                    MORGAN
                  Just because the Prince couldn't
                  close the deal, doesn't mean he
                  didn't kill her.  Still processing
                his clothes. 

                                  NICK
                And he had a lot of them.
                        (re: file)
                  Serial number on the lipstick cam 
                  came back to a store in Henderson.
                  Buyer paid cash.  Pulled some
                  partials, Mandy's running them now.

                                    MORGAN
                My money's on the Prince.  Gets one
                of his crew to install the camera, 
                so what happens in Vegas doesn't
                  have to stay in Vegas.  He can have
                  "movie night" back at the palace.

                                  NICK
                  There is another way of looking at
                  this.  Cheap consumer camera, easy
                  access to the suite...
                        (off Morgan)
                ... You said Maria's husband was
                out of work, she was supporting the
                  family.  She was the Prince's maid
                of choice, maybe she saw a payday.

                                    MORGAN
                  Gives the Prince even more motive.

                                  NICK
                  Gives us more than that.  
                        (then)
                  That camera might've recorded the
                  murder.  We get our hands on the
                  video, maybe we lay hands on our
                  killer.

  As this lands, they move into --


38INT. CSI - FINGERPRINT LAB - DAY (CONTINUOUS)38

  -- where Nick and Morgan find MANDY WEBSTER at work on a
    computer. 

  ON THE MONITOR: We see PARTIAL PRINTS IN DIFFERENT COLORS.
  THREE are already pieced together like a puzzle, with
    overlapping areas.  Mandy mouse-drags the last COLORED PARTIAL
  over to the "puzzle".

  Nick and Morgan watch, as Mandy tries to fit the last piece.

                                  NICK
                How we doing?

  Mandy holds up a hand --

                                  MANDY WEBSTER
                  Doing?  How about giving me some
                  hover space?  

  Nick takes a step back, bumps into Morgan.

                                  NICK
                  Okay.  Not hovering.

  Mandy fits the last piece, creates a roughly intact composite
    print.  Hits "SEARCH".  As AFIS scrolls, she looks at Morgan --

                                  MANDY WEBSTER
                His sweet talk has never worked on
                me.

                                    MORGAN
                I'm not so sweet.

                                  MANDY WEBSTER
                  I like you.

  As "MATCH" FLASHES on the screen, Mandy clicks on the
    SUSPECT'S RAP SHEET.  

                                  MANDY WEBSTER
                        (to Nick)
                You may approach the AFIS.

  Nick and Morgan step up to the monitor.  ON THE MONITOR: A
  PHOTO of "MATTHEW LAPAZ", "22".  Juvie record, priors for
  drug possession.  Plus WORK CARD.

                Guy had access to the hotel.  Think

                  Found drug residue in the Prince's
                  room.  Maybe Lapaz hooked a brother
                up.  For more than just drugs.

                                    MORGAN

39INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY39

    Xiomara strides down the hall, with a file.  N.D. CSIs bend
    around her like she was a force field.  Think Clint Eastwood
  in Dirty Harry.  She KNOCKS and enters --


40INT. CSI - RUSSELL'S OFFICE - DAY40

    Russell looks up from his desk, as Xiomara enters.

                                    XIOMARA GARCIA
                  Word is you like stories.  I got a

  one test.

                38 Colt dumped at the museum was
                  definitely the gun that shot Oscar
                  Goodman.  Ran the test fires through
                  IBIS.  Gun's connected to seven
                  prior shootings.  And here's your
                  Mickey Spillane --

  She hands him an IBIS PRINT-OUT.

                                    XIOMARA GARCIA
                All seven date back to the '80's.

                  Know them?  It's a who's who of

                So, Brassy, what's with the sit
                  down?  Finally find Vinnie?*

                                  BRASS
                No.  But we found his gun.

  Brass slides a PHOTO of the .38 COLT in front of her.

                  Aww.  He always liked them bright
                and shiny.  Just like his bimbos.

                                  BRASS
                  Well, this 'bright and shiny' shot
                  Oscar Goodman last night.  I'm
                  thinking Vinnie might have come*
                  home?

                                    JOANNA SAPPHIRE
                  Well, if he came home, he didn't
                  come home to me.  
                        (then)
                But if anything could bring him
                  back from the dead, it's Oscar
                  Goodman's mob museum.  No induction
                for Vinnie.  After all he did.*

                                  BRASS
                Now that is a crime.  And maybe
                  motive to put a few holes in the
                  Mayor.  But he had help.

                                    JOANNA SAPPHIRE
                  Don't look at me.  I like Oscar.  I
                  even contributed to his campaigns. 
                  Now, Vinnie, he felt different.  *
                For good reason if you remember.  

                                  BRASS
                  Oscar refused to rep Vinnie even*
                  though he was looking at the needle. 

                                    JOANNA SAPPHIRE
                  Gave him some b.s. excuse about
                  'looking for the good in his
                  clients'.  And not seeing any in
                  Vinnie.  What kind of lawyer is*
                  that?  

                                  BRASS
                  You're right.  Good guys don't need
                  lawyers.  Do you?

                                    JOANNA SAPPHIRE
                  Look, Vinnie bailed on me.  And our*
                  marriage.  Twenty years ago.  If he
                  came back today, I'd tell him the

                If the bastard did need help with
                  anything, like taking down the Mayor,
                you should do what Vinnie always*
                did -- look for a new piece of ass.

                  refill that bottle of whiskey you
                  keep in your drawer.

  She KNOCKS on his desk, exits.  OFF Brass, considering it --

    Hodges works the computer.  Catherine beside him.  Both
    staring at TRAFFIC CAM FOOTAGE, frozen on the image of a
    VINTAGE 80'S CADILLAC COUPE DE VILLE PHAETON.    

                                    HODGES

                  Same model as the one they used in

                  I failed.  Twice.  I still get
                  nightmares about all those cones.

    Catherine gives him a look, then --

                  What about the tire impressions in

                  Oddfellas.  Or more precisely,
                  Detroit, 1979.  Tire impressions
                  were made by bias plies.  Same specs
                as factory tires for a '79 Caddy.

45EXT. NATIONAL MOB MUSEUM - BACK ALLEY - DAY45

  Still taped off.  Black and white at each end of the alley. 
  Greg is searching for the MISSING ROUNDS from the Guard's
    weapon.  Russell approaches from the back of the museum.

                                    RUSSELL
                You find those two missing rounds
                  from the Security Guard's gun?

                                  GREG
                  Nope.  I'm starting to think they're
                in the next county.  Or in Vinnie*
                  Sapphire.  

    Russell walks over, eyes the Security Guard's blood pool.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Only blood in this alley is from
                the guard.  
                        (then, mulling)
                He was shot with a 44.  Two shooters
                  inside had 38s.

                                  GREG
                        (re: tire impressions)
                  Maybe whoever was driving Vinnie's*
                  getaway car was packing the 44.

                                    RUSSELL
                          (considers, then)
                  Greg, do me a favor.  Shoot me in
                the face.

                                  GREG
                  What?

                                    RUSSELL
                  Shoot me in the face.  Pretend gun.  
                        (mimes a gun)
                One foot away.  Don't miss.

                                  GREG
                  You're the boss.

  Greg 'draws' his finger and stalks Russell.  



                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Maid Man" - 1204 - WHITE - 8/23/1132.

45CONTINUED:45

  When he gets within an arm's length of Russell, Russell
    quickly draws his own finger and instinctively unloads into
  Greg.  Six times. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

                                  GREG
                  Hey, I wasn't ready.

    Russell is deaf to his protests, his wheels turning, a piece
  of the puzzle falling into place.  Finally, to Greg --

                                    RUSSELL
                  This was good.  I'm glad we worked
                  this out.  You're done.  Bullets
                  aren't out here.  And they're not
                in the next county.  Or in Vinnie*
                  Sapphire either.

  Greg, at a loss, watches as Russell turns and heads back
  into the museum.  What was that?  As he 'holsters' his finger --

                                                                                CUT TO:

  PAN ACROSS the LIPSTICK CAMERA and TRANSMITTER recovered

                TOD put the murder around three
                  a.m.

  Nick pulls up the digital recording from 3 AM.  Hits "PLAY" --

  ON THE LAPTOP: We see the camera is NOT ANGLED on the BED,
  but instead focused tightly ON THE NIGHTSTAND by the bed.

                  What the hell?  Can't even see the

                  Alright.

  Nick scans through the footage.  Until... 

  ON THE LAPTOP: We see a FEMALE HAND enter frame.  

  Nick stops scanning, hits PLAY.  

  ON THE LAPTOP: The FEMALE HAND opens the NIGHTSTAND DOOR,
    revealing a SAFE.  The HAND punches in a CODE, opens the
  safe.  Removes a MAN'S BRACELET.  And then, a moment later...
    replaces the BRACELET.  Before closing the SAFE, making sure
  to wipe it down and remove any prints.

  As Nick processes what he's seen, the nickel drops for Morgan --

                                    MORGAN
                My first year in L.A., I worked 
                  fraud cases.  Learned how to tell
                the difference between real and
                  fake... a 'Rolez' versus a 'Rolex'.

    Morgan looks at Nick --

                                    MORGAN
                  When I printed the Prince, I noticed
                he was wearing a counterfeit watch. 
                  Thought maybe he was just cheap.

                                  NICK
                          (putting it together)
                Not cheap.  Scammed.
                        (then)
                  This wasn't about sex tapes, or
                    extortion...  

                                    MORGAN
                ... Lapaz and Garza were working
                  together.  Used the camera to get
                the code to the safe, then swapped
                out the Prince's bling for
                    counterfeit.

48INT. P.D. - INTERROGATION ROOM "B" - DAY48

  The Prince, his expression inscrutable, as he stares across
  at... Brass and Morgan.  A CRIME SCENE PHOTO of the dead
  Maria Garza on the table between them.  

  After a fat beat, the Prince slips the fake Rolex off his
    wrist.  He studies it in the palm of his hand.  Then... slams
  the watch as hard as he can against the table.  Smashing it.  

    Morgan doesn't flinch.  Just stares him down --

                                    MORGAN
                  That's evidence.  

                                  BRASS
                And that's a lot of anger.

    A beat, as the Prince holds Brass' look --

                                    PRINCE JALAL*
                  Until this moment, I had no idea
                  anyone had stolen anything from me. 
                        (then)
                And even if I knew, do you seriously
                  think I'd kill a maid over a watch?

                                  BRASS
                  Yeah, I do.

  Brass lays down keycard records --

                                  BRASS
                  Checked your suite's keycard logs. 
                You returned from the pool at 2:52
                  a.m.  Four minutes after Maria Garza
                  entered to start cleaning up.

                                    PRINCE JALAL*
                So I came back to change before
                  going to the casino.  I was there
                  for... a minute at most.  If the
                  maid was in my suite, perhaps she
                was in another room.  I didn't see
                  her.

                          (throws it back at her)
                You said her husband's out of work.
                She was supporting her four kids. 
                  Who's going to take care of them?

62EXT. LAS VEGAS SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING - DAY62


63INT. CSI - LAYOUT ROOM - DAY 63

  OPEN on an OLD CSI EVIDENCE PHOTO of a WORN BLACK LEATHER
    JOURNAL with the initials "LG" on the front.

                                    ECKLIE (O.S.)
                The guard got himself killed over
                  this?  

  FIND Russell, Catherine, Greg and Ecklie around the table. 

                                    ECKLIE
                ... An old journal?

                                    RUSSELL
                  Journal's the only thing missing
                  from the Gedda exhibit.

                                    ECKLIE
                  A mobster who journals?  Great for
                law enforcement.  

                                    CATHERINE
                  It's mostly blank pages.  Except
                for the last two.  

                                  GREG
                  Which aren't exactly "Dear Diary."

                                    ECKLIE
                  What are they?

                                  GREG
                  A "To Do" list.  "Do" as in "Whack".

  Greg slaps down photocopies of the TWO JOURNAL PAGES.  A
  LONG LIST OF HANDWRITTEN NAMES -- twenty-eight total, all
    CHECKED OFF.  Ecklie studies the list.


                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Maid Man" - 1204 - WHITE - 8/23/1143.

                                    ECKLIE
                  I assume a check means 'done'?

                                    RUSSELL
                  Dead, or presumed dead. 

                                    ECKLIE
                So, Vinnie Sapphire comes back to*
                  town.  Shoots Oscar Goodman to settle
                  a score. Then steals Gedda's hit
                  list.  Why?  He was Gedda's hitman,
                he knows all their names.

                                    RUSSELL
                All except one.  The last one... 

                                    ECKLIE
                        (reads off list)
                ... Cesare Mastrantonio?*

                                    CATHERINE
                No birth certificate.  Just a death
                    certificate.  Guy never existed.  

  All are puzzled.  But Russell's excitement kicks in -- 

                                    RUSSELL
                But he's the answer to all our
                  questions. 

  Just then, Ecklie's CELL rings.  He checks the display, then -- 

                                    ECKLIE
                        (into cell)
                Now what?
                          (listening)
                  Good work, Jim. 

    Ecklie hangs up, looks to group -- 

                                    ECKLIE
                  Brass found Vinnie Sapphire's car*
                at a motel near Boulder Highway. *


64EXT. MOTEL - DAY64*

  OPEN ON a '79 Coupe de Ville with a familiar license plate,
  but a new sticker.  Catherine turns, sees Brass breaking off
  from a Q & A with the MOTEL MANAGER.  He passes by UNIs, one
  with a shotgun, pressed up against a wall, eyes on ROOM 137. *
  He joins her --

                                  BRASS
                  Vinnie Sapphire's registered in*

65INT. MOTEL - SAPPHIRE'S ROOM - DAY 65*

  Door BLASTS OPEN to REVEAL Brass and a UNI, guns out.  They
    enter, see -- 

    A DEAD WOMAN (MONIQUE ROBERTS, 45), in a VINTAGE MAN'S SUIT,
  face down on the bed, hair matted with blood. Hat next to
  her.  FEATHERS everywhere. Brass gives a nod to Catherine
    outside, who enters.  

                                  BRASS
                Hat on the bed, always bad luck.

    Catherine indicates a pillow on the bed, with a SINGED BULLET
  HOLE through it.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Explains why no one heard a shot.

  Then, she spies a 44 magnum revolver on the floor.  Takes a
  knee, checks it out -- 

                                    CATHERINE
                44.  Same caliber used on the
                  Security Guard.  Looks like the
                  same suit that was circling the
                  museum in the caddie. 

  Brass finds a purse on the dresser.  Finds an Arizona license.

                                  BRASS
                        (off the license)

                  Friend of a lot of his friends.

                                  BRASS
                If she ended up with Vinnie, maybe*
                  went on the lam with him.

                And if that's her 44, she may be
                our getaway driver.

A66EXT. NATIONAL MOB MUSEUM - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT (VERSION)A66

    Stanley Gant, the Security Guard, runs out of the museum. 
    Approaches the Caddie, leans in the passenger window, handing
  over the journal to --


B66INT. CADILLAC COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS - VERSION)B66

    Monique, behind the wheel, in Vinnie's suit and hat.  As she*
  takes the journal with one hand --

                                    STANLEY GANT
                See you later --

  Just then, she shoots him with the other.  Shocked, he falls
  back onto the pavement.

                                                                    WHITE FLASH TO:

                                  BRASS
                  Maybe Vinnie wanted us chasing the*
                  wrong Vinnie.  Better to catch her,*
                  than him.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Well, he caught her for us.

  Under this, Brass has crossed to the closet, sees a line of
  men's suits, shirts, ties... all circa 1980s. 

                                  BRASS
                  Looks like Vinnie left in a hurry. *
                  Dumped his suits, car... bimbo. 

    Catherine looks around --

                                    CATHERINE
                  I don't see Gedda's journal.  

                                  BRASS
                No journal, no Vinnie.  I'm getting*
                  sick of being one step behind this
                  clown.*  CSI: "Maid Man" - 1204 - WHITE - 8/23/1146.


66EXT. LAS VEGAS SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT66


67INT. P.D. - RECEPTION - NIGHT67

    Morgan carries a personal PROPERTY ENVELOPE to Prince Jalal,*
    waiting at the Reception desk.  She hands him the envelope.  

                                    MORGAN
                  These belong to you. 

  He opens it, looks inside --

    PRINCE JALAL'S POV: Inside the envelope are his real Rolex*
  and miscellaneous jewelry.

                                    PRINCE JALAL*
                    I understand you caught the person
                  responsible for the housekeeper's
                  murder.

                                    MORGAN
                  That's right.

                                    PRINCE JALAL*
                  This woman... Maria Garza.  She
                  lost her life...

                ... Over this.  
                        (beat)
                  Someone with nothing... gave
                  everything... for me.

  The Prince reaches into his coat pocket.  Takes out an
    ENVELOPE and hands it to Morgan.

                                    PRINCE JALAL*
                  Please give this to her family.

  The Prince holds Morgan's look for a beat.  Wants to say
  more to her, but can't.  He turns and walks away.

    Morgan watches him leave.  Opens the envelope and looks inside --

    MORGAN'S POV: A check made out to "The Garza Family".  In
  the amount of "$100,000".

  OFF Morgan's reaction... 

    PRE-LAP a THUMP-THUMP-CATCH...

                  GREG!

  Greg comes in, less flustered.  More accustomed to this now.

                                  GREG
                  Yeah?

                                    RUSSELL
                  Death certificate.  Even if you

                Not buried in a cemetery.

    carrying flowers.

                                  GREG
                  Really?  You had to stop in the

                  Shouldn't we call Brass?

                                    RUSSELL
                If Vinnie Sapphire's here, he'll*
                  think we're paying our respects. 
                  Then, we call the cops.

                                  GREG
                For the record.  I'd rather have a
                  bunch of cops than a bunch of
                  flowers.

  Just as they hit the top of the stairs, they hear O.S. the
  SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS.  


70INT. MAUSOLEUM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)70*

  They head down the main corridor, following the sound, passing
  walls of GLASS-FRONTED URN NICHES. Just then, they hear a
  LOUD CRASH OF STONE ON STONE, WOOD SPLINTERING.

  They exchange a look.  Then, a SCREAM! They quicken their
  pace, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING, then blending into the SOUND OF
    SOBBING coming from the end of the corridor.

  Greg slides Russell a look, as they round a corner. Their
  eyes immediately find BROKEN GLASS from one of the glass
    fronts.  Then, the remnants of a SHATTERED URN and WOODEN
  ASH BOX, NAMEPLATE still attached. It reads: "CESARE*
    MASTRANTONIO".  No ashes, no nothing.  Just the tears of...  *

    Joanna Sapphire, sitting on the floor, head in her hands.
    Sobbing...

                  Vinnie, that sonofabitch.  He was*
                  always a disappointment.

    Russell leans in and pulls a FEATHER from her suit, like the
    feathers we saw in the motel room.


71INT. P.D. - INTERROGATION ROOM "A" - DAY 71

  Brass sits across from Joanna Sapphire, in jumps.

                                  BRASS
                We got your prints in the motel

                  Yeah, there was...  In his suitcase,

                  died of cancer and she'd just tossed
                him in Lake Mead.  Can't afford a
                  funeral, 'cause she's broke.  Figures
                I'm broker.  So, that's how I ended
                up in bed with the bimbo.

                I'm telling you, this is great.  On
                his deathbed, Vinnie tells Monique,*
                the mistress, about Lou Gedda's
                  stash of cash.  His rainy-day fund.

                                    ECKLIE
                ... And tells her how to find it?

                                    RUSSELL
                  Last name on the hit list.  Of*
                  course, the list had been in the*
                  police evidence vault for years.

                  Until Oscar got it out of evidence*
                and put it in the museum.  *

                  Joanna starts fishing for an invite,*
                  while Monique starts charming the*

                So why go after Oscar?

                                    JOANNA SAPPHIRE
                He ruined my marriage.  I mean,*
                  Vinnie was a good earner.  And if*
                  Oscar'd taken his case, he woulda
                  beat that murder rap.  And not run
                off with his goomar.  Oscar got
                  what he deserved.  Well, almost --

    Resume Russell with Ecklie and the Sheriff. 

                                    ECKLIE
                She explain why Monique was running*
                  around wearing Vinnie's clothes?*

                                    RUSSELL
                  Same reason they got his car and*
                gun out of mothballs.  They were*
                  setting him up.  To quote: 'Perfect
                  fall guy's a dead guy'.

                                    SHERIFF LISTON*

                We sure as hell fell for it.

                        (then)

                So what happened to Gedda's stash
                of cash?

                                    RUSSELL

                  Can't say for sure, but the previous
                  mortuary manager retired about five
                  years ago to a villa in St. Barts.

  Just then, Oscar Goodman walks down the hall.  As he passes --

                                    ECKLIE

                Mr. Mayor, can I help you?

                                  OSCAR GOODMAN
                  I know my way.  I spent more time
                in these halls than the three of
                you put together.
                        (then)
                I'm going to see my client.

                                    SHERIFF LISTON*
                  Your client?  Who's that?

                  Joanna Sapphire.

                                    RUSSELL
                She tried to kill you.

                                  OSCAR GOODMAN
                  I know.

                                    ECKLIE
                        (more emphatic)
                She tried to kill you.

                                  OSCAR GOODMAN
                  Doesn't mean she's not entitled to
                    representation.  This is America.

  As Oscar Goodman continues into the Interrogation Room, they

                If I'm ever in trouble, I want that
                guy defending me.

                                    RUSSELL
                If I'm ever in trouble... I want
                his suit.

  OFF Russell.
