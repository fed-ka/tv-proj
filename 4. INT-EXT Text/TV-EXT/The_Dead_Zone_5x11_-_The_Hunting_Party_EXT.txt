                    I tripped over something and that's
                    when I found his body.  He'd been
                    shot through the head.

      Walt draws his gun and ENTERS the building.



      A dilapidated double-wide trailer.  Johnny and Frost step up
      to the front door.

                                      FROST
                    Listen, why don't you go in first.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I doubt they'd let you live, just to
                    kill you again a few hours later.

                                      FROST
                    That makes sense.
                          (beat)
                    Go first anyway.

      Johnny shakes his head and ENTERS the trailer.


      A filthy HOMELESS MAN washes himself in a public water
      fountain; his hair, his face, his neck.  Johnny and Frost
      wait behind him, finally Frost has had enough.

                                      FROST
                    Ok, this is a drinking fountain, not
                    a bath house!

      He grabs the guy and pushes him aside.

                      Cleanliness is next to Godliness.

      Frost pulls out a few dollars and sticks them in the guy's
      top pocket.

                                      FROST
                    Yeah?  Here, buy yourself some after
                    shave and you're on your way to
                    Heaven!

      The guy ambles away, as Johnny steps up to the fountain,

                                    WOLF
                    If you consider formulating foreign
                    policy, controlling global currency
                    and unleashing the American war
                    machine as big business, then you've
                    got some idea of what's at stake.

                    On the contrary, these individuals
                    operate through precision and
                      efficiency.  Everything is a means
                    to an end.  Even a seemingly
                      insignificant magazine sweepstakes.

      Johnny can't help but glance back at him for a second, then...

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're saying some evil organization
                    of power hungry billionaires sent me
                    a home computer?

                                    WOLF
                    There are no coincidences.  Everyone
                    plays a role.  You, of all people,
                    should realize that.

      The idea strikes Johnny hard.

3838WE TRACK THE FOOT CHASE

      Through the crowded park, as Wolf is suddenly blind-sided by
      a dark-haired WOMAN; the impact jarring both of them.

      Wolf shakes it off and sprints away, as the Woman vanishes
      into the crowd.  Wolf suddenly slows, his gait growing
      strained, until he STOPS, TURNS to face Johnny and COLLAPSES.

      Johnny rushes to where he's lying and kneels.  Wolf's eyes
      are slightly open as he struggles to breath.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Who did this?  Please, before it's
                    too late.

                    They brought me here as a witness. 
                    Why not?  They knew I couldn't prove

      Everything fits.

                                      JOHNNY
                    They're going to kill Danbury in the
                    woods.

                                    WALT
                    I'll drive.

      They take off.



      Walt's cruiser, lights flashing, races along the two-lane
      backwoods highway; kicking up a cloud of debris...



      The area is besieged with ambulances, FBI sedans, media vans,
      National Guard trucks; a virtual war zone teaming with an
      army of EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL.



      Johnny and Walt snake their way (in the cruiser) through a
      gathering of REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN clamoring for position
      behind crowd control barriers.  Walt stops a CAMERAMAN...

                                    WALT
                    What's going on?

                                      CAMERAMAN
                    Some nut shot the Vice President. 
                    They airlifted him out a few minutes
                    ago.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What was his condition?

                                      CAMERAMAN
                    I don't know.  He took one in the
                    head.  It's Kennedy all over again.

                    Anybody else hurt?

                                      CAMERAMAN
                    Stillson.  They say he got shot and
                    then killed the bad guy.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Any idea who the shooter was?

                                      CAMERAMAN
                    Beats me.  This place is about to
                    become a zoo.

      The guy takes off, as Walt looks at Johnny.  They both know
      in their hearts who the alleged killer is.

                                    WALT
                    We should go back.  Contact the FBI
                    and tell them everything.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Without evidence.  They'd throw us
                    out. 
                            (determined)
                    I'm staying here.  I need to know. 
                    I need to see it for myself.

      Johnny quickly OPENS the car door.

                                    WALT
                    John, wait!

      It's too late.  He's already disappeared into the crowd.



      An ambulance sits unattended.  Johnny emerges from the rear,
      now wearing an EMT jump suit and a baseball cap; carrying a
      silver tank of oxygen.  He keeps his head down as he
      approaches a young National Guardsman, the last line of
      defense between him and the truth.

                                      GUARDSMAN
                    Nobody goes in!

                                      JOHNNY
                    They just radioed up that they need
                    another tank of oxygen for Congressman
                    Stillson.

                                      GUARDSMAN
                    I have orders.

                          (thinking on his feet)
                    I don't know what your name is, but
                    if a United States Congressman dies
                    because you didn't let me do my job,
                    I promise you that everybody in the
                    world will know it by dinner tonight. 

      The young Guardsman folds under the pressure.

                                      GUARDSMAN
                    Okay, go.

      Johnny heads inside the crime scene perimeter.  Investigators
      everywhere.  Dogs.  Secret Service.  FBI.  Utter chaos.

      NEW ANGLE

      A team of PARAMEDICS appear, guiding an occupied gurney
      towards Johnny... it's Stillson; bloodied and bandaged, an
      IV in his arm.

                                      JOHNNY
                    They said you guys might need another
                    tank.

                                      PARAMEDIC
                    What we need is two more hands.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'm your man.

      Johnny falls in line, taking hold of one of the guide rails. 
      Stillson, barely conscious, suddenly recognizes Johnny. 
      He's been given morphine for pain and is a bit out of it.

                                      STILLSON
                          (groggy)
                    I got him, Smith.  I shot the bastard.

      Johnny touches his arm... WHOOSH!



      An entourage of men dressed in plaid gear, all carrying
      hunting rifles, navigate the lush vegetation.  Danbury is up
      front, flanked by two SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  They are dressed
      to fit in, but their dark sunglasses and earpieces give them
      away.  Stillson brings up the rear.

      Observer Johnny paces the group. Danbury looks back...

                                      DANBURY
                    Greg, get on up here.  Can't get in
                    the action if you're not on the front
                    line.

      Stillson obliges, falling in next to him.

                                      STILLSON
                    Thank you, sir.

                                      DANBURY
                    Call me Doc.

                                      STILLSON
                    Yes, sir.  I mean, Doc.

      We can read Stillson's nervousness.

                                      DANBURY
                    First time in the big woods? 

                                      STILLSON
                    No, sir.  I used to hunt with my
                    father when I was a boy.

                                      DANBURY
                    Bear?  Elk? 

                                      STILLSON
                      Squirrels. 

      Danbury hesitates then begins to laugh.

                                      DANBURY
                      Squirrels.  You boys hear that?  We
                    got us an honest-to-God squirrel
                    hunter!  

      The other men laugh, as Stillson musters a smile, clearly
      uncomfortable and nervous.  If Stillson had any reservations
      about this man dying, it all went away when he was laughed
      at.

                                      STILLSON
                    Shame about Senator Jennings missing
                    the trip.  

                                      DANBURY
                    That'll teach the old coot to order
                    his steaks rare.  Besides, if he
                    hadn't got sick, you wouldn't be
                    here, right? 

                                      STILLSON
                    Right.

      A sudden STIRRING in the bushes draws their attention.

                    Look alive, boys.

      The assembled level their rifles, aiming at the roost.

      STILLSON

      raises the sight to his eye.  A glint of light assaults his
      peripheral, drawing his gaze hard right...  

      WHOOSH PAN to reveal a lone FIGURE one hundred yards off,
      standing in a clearing pointing a sniper rifle our way.

      Stillson, as scripted, reacts.

                                      STILLSON
                    Mr. Vice President! 

      SLOW MOTION 

      BANG!  A high velocity projectile tears through the neck of
      a secret service agent, traveling straight through him...
      striking Danbury in the head, splattering Stillson with a
      hailstorm of blood.

      BANG!  A 2nd SHOT grazes Stillson's left shoulder.  He
      recoils, but doesn't go down.

      NEW ANGLE - STILLSON

      Using his remaining strength, he shifts his rifle into
      position, aims at the assailant and fires!  WHOOSH! 


7272BACK TO REALITY - JOHNNY

      Releases his grip as Stillson closes his eyes.  Johnny steps
      away from the gurney as Stillson is loaded into the ambulance. 
      Rattled, Johnny TURNS and notices another gurney; this one
      occupied by a full body bag.

      BACK TO JOHNNY

      stepping over the body.  Reaching out, slowly unzipping the
      bag to REVEAL... Marshall Frost!

      Johnny reacts, wounded; stung by his failure to protect.

      moving to Frost's chest.  WHOOSH!       DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT FOUR - 8/15/05 - GREEN 51.

      solution, shoot through him.  BANG! 

      THE SNIPER

      It's Johnny, wearing military camouflage and his face painted
      in black streaks.  He shifts the rifle, aims, and fires again. 
      BANG!

      missing completely.

      dropping to the ground.  He crawls quickly behind some cover
      and throws back some branches to REVEAL MARSHALL FROST. 
      He's already dead from what appears to be a gaping chest
      wound.  

      Johnny, wearing gloves, quickly slips the rifle into Frost's
      hand, then...

      He straddles the body, a beat to review his handiwork; perhaps
      something more.  He slowly leans in and kisses Frost on the
      forehead as he pulls back, we now SEE the sniper's true
      identity is KENDRA CROWE. 

      Observer Johnny now watches helplessly as she scrambles away
      into the thick forest, leaving Frost behind as the perfect
      patsy. An army of Secret Service Men descend on the area, as
      FRANTIC VOICES echo through the tree tops.  WHOOSH!
