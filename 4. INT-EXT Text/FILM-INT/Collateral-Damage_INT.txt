NYFD Lt. GORDY PITT strains as he works the handle of an
old-time, hand-cranked ice cream maker. It's a tough job
requiring strength, patience and determination. In a
nutshell, that's Gordy.
Firefighter JUNIOR MONTINE, black Panamanian descent,
watches Gordy crank away.
JUNIOR
Hear the big news, Lieutenant?
It's the twenty-first century.
We
got electricity now.
Gordy keeps cranking.

JUNIOR
Got these supermarkets, too.
Big
places, freezers full o' ice
cream.
Gordy stops.
Pops the lid.
Spoons out a dollop.
GORDY
Open up.
He sticks the spoon in Junior's mouth.
Junior eats.
Junior loves it. Gordy smiles.
GORDY
Screw the twenty-first century.
The FIRE BELL SOUNDS.

Everyone scrambles. The choreography's practiced,
automatic. It's achieved without conversation.
The channel surfer slides down the fire pole.
He's
followed by the man who was upstairs snoring.
Junior rips a sheet from the teleprinter. He hands the
printout to the snorer, the company's "chauffeur."
Feet jam into boots. Yellow trousers are hauled up and
hitched with suspenders.
Yellow jackets are whipped on.
The chauffeur TURNS OVER the PUMPER'S huge MOTOR.
Firefighters take their stations on the truck. Headsets
go on. As the fire company's lieutenant, Gordy rides
shotgun. The chauffeur hands him the printout. As the
engine moves out under lights and SIREN, Gordy speaks to
the men over the headsets --
GORDY
Second alarm. Multiple dwelling
between Third and Lex.

Gordy and his men charge the stairs dragging the heavy
hoses. Rats head past in the opposite direction,
deserting the burning building.

THIRD FLOOR

They meet fire on the third floor. On goes the water.
Gordy quickly checks rooms on the floor for occupants,
using the axe to open locked doors, then taps Junior and
Mike, indicates "up." Begins leading the hose team up
the stairwell. Sees something and yells a warning --
GORDY
Stairs're screwed. Hug the wall.

FOURTH FLOOR

They reach the fourth floor.
There's fire everywhere.
And then...

They see a FIREFIGHTER from the other company. He has
fallen through a gaping hole in the floor of the hallway
above. He's pinned under a large section of heavy
debris, coughing and screaming for help as fire rages
around him. To Junior and Mike --
GORDY
Knock it back!
They turn the hose on the flames as Gordy moves to the
trapped firefighter. Gordy tries lifting the debris,
can't budge it. He starts chopping at it with the axe.
Chunks of plaster fly as the axe bites again and again.
Gordy hacks off a large piece of debris. He levers his
axe under the portion still trapping the firefighter.
Mike moves to help. Gordy heaves up on the axe. The
debris lifts. He heaves harder. It lifts more,
until...
Mike slides the firefighter out. Gordy yanks his axe
free. The debris collapses. Gordy moves to the
firefighter.
FIREFIGHTER #1
Two floors up. I heard
screaming... Couldn't get there.
GORDY
Where?
FIREFIGHTER #1
End of the hall.

GORDY

takes off. Charges the next flight of stairs. Reaches
the fifth floor. Tries to reach six, but there's too
much fire. He's beaten back... but not before he hears
the FAINT sound of SCREAMING.
10
NEW ANGLE
10
Gordy looks down the fifth floor hallway to an apartment
door at the end. Between him and the door is the gaping
hole in the floor. It's too big to jump. He starts
running. He's gonna jump it.
Gordy reaches the edge of the hole. Leaps with all he's
got. At the same time, he swings the axe, point-first.
Slams it into a spot high on the wall, and...
(CONTINUED)

Gordy swings over the hole on the axe handle.
He hits the other side running. Drives a shoulder into
the door at the end of the hall.
11
11
Gordy bursts in. It's an inferno. He looks up. Knocks
his axe on the ceiling. Hears desperate POUNDING back.
Gordy climbs a table. Starts whacking upward with the
axe, attacking the peeling, crumbled plaster overhead.
Gordy is trying to hack a hole into the room above, but
he's not doing it fast enough. He won't beat the fire.
12
12
Gordy calls down to his men.
GORDY
Give me the hose!
MIKE
This place is gone! It could
flashover any second!
GORDY
Give me the goddamn hose!
Beat.
Mike and Junior pass the hose up.
13
13
Gordy aims the nozzle at the hole he started in the
ceiling. Turns it on full jet.
Gordy's barely able to hold the hose as the high-pressure
stream bites into old, decayed plaster.
Bit by bit the ceiling falls away.
Gordy's almost
through to the room above, when...
Falling debris severs the hose. Gordy's lost pressure.
He hasn't broken through. The building's coming down.
He's gotta get outta there.
Gordy's not going anywhere. Picks up the axe.
Attacks
the hole again furiously, until finally...
6.
14
GORDY
14
breaks through! A small hole, which he quickly widens,
to reveal... a terrified Latino family gaping down at
him, their room ablaze around them. Gordy reaches up.
Speaks to them in Spanglish --
GORDY
It's okay... Esta bien, esta
bien... Come with me... Con mio...
15
15
Gordy lowers the family through the floor hole.

ANNE PITT, thirties, reaches out and KILLS the ALARM.
She rolls over. The other half of the bed's empty. We
hear a CHILD'S VOICE from another room.
18
18
Anne opens the door to find an exhausted Gordy sitting on
the floor with their four-year-old son, MATT. They're
building a K'nex spaceship.
MATT
Look what we made!
ANNE
Nice rocket... That took a while.
GORDY
He was awake when I got home.
His
throat still hurts.
ANNE
Shit.
MATT
That's a bad word.
GORDY
You're right.

ANNE
Sorry.
She feels Matt's forehead.
Gordy's done it already.
GORDY
No fever.
ANNE
(to Matt)
You better see Dr. Bob.
(to Gordy)
And this time, no opening fire
hydrants to play in till he's
completely well.
GORDY
Yes, ma'am.
She leans down and kisses him.
There's passion in it.
ANNE
How was your shift?
GORDY
(shrugs)
The usual.
She yawns.
Starts heading out.
ANNE
Dreamed I did a triple axel in an
ice skating championship.
GORDY
(beat; calls after
her)
Come back and let me see those
legs again.
19

Gordy holds Matt in his arms as water pours over them.
It's the second child he's held in the last few hours.
This one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid:
what a father wants for his child. We see the deep
affection Gordy has for his son. He holds Matt tightly,
skin to skin, and kisses the boy's wet head...
Anne opens the shower door.
She's on the phone.

ANNE
Dr. Bob can squeeze him in at

GORDY
I have a game. But yeah, if we do
the handoff at the doctor's.
ANNE
(into phone)
Yes, he'll be there... Thanks.
(hangs up; to Gordy)
Five-of in front of Dr. Bob's.
Don't be late.
(to Matt)
Let's get you out, sweetie. Your
father just can't keep you dry.
She leads Matt out. Closes the shower door. Gordy
sticks his face into the water. Looks back, finds...
Two bare butts, Anne's and Matt's, are pressed against
the shower door's foggy glass. OFF Gordy, laughing --

26
Traffic jam on Park Avenue South. Gordy's anxious.
Checks his watch. He's late. To the cabbie --
GORDY
Try Fifth.
27
28
Fifth Avenue's also a parking lot.
GORDY
Shit.
He jams money in the pay dish.
GORDY
I'm getting outta here.
29

Gordy's on a gurney on an I.V., his thigh heavily
bandaged. Junior and the rookie, Ronnie, are with him,
but there's no chatter -- Gordy's shut down, oblivious to
everyone around him.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Mike is on a cell phone nearby as Sal, the other veteran
from the engine company, enters and approaches him. Into
the phone --
MIKE
Hang on.
Mike turns his attention to Sal, who's clearly blown away
by the bad news that brought him here --
SAL
Dammit...
MIKE
Tell me about it.
SAL
How's he holding up?
(CONTINUED)

MIKE
He's shut down... We were hoping
they'd keep him here, and he
wouldn't have to go home right
away, but they're cutting him
loose.
SAL
Want me to stay at home with him?
MIKE
Rookie's taking the first shift.
I'm just getting the schedule at
the firehouse rearranged now.
Mike goes back to the phone, and Sal crosses to Gordy.
He puts a hand on Gordy's shoulder, grips it firmly.
SAL
Hey.
Got here as fast as I could.
Gordy sees him, but says nothing.
SAL
I know it sucks... It really
sucks...
Gordy can't go there.
Beat.
Sal releases his grip.
SAL
How's the leg?
RONNIE
Cut's deep, but no major vessels
were severed. He's got a load 'o
silk holding it all together.
Junior, who stepped off to talk to a cop, now comes back.
JUNIOR
Just came over the police radio...
Consulate surveillance cameras
caught the bomber in the act. He
was disguised as a cop.
Gordy looks over.
What Junior just said has triggered
something.
GORDY

Gordy yanks out his I.V., and starts to get up.

A well-lit, sectioned-off area of the garage secured by a
chain-link fence.
Phipps enters.
As he passes Dray, already there --
PHIPPS
How long before we have a secure
computer network?
DRAY
An hour.
They're building it now.
Phipps moves to a FORENSIC EXPERT hovering over a table
of small fragments.
PHIPPS
What do you got?
FORENSIC EXPERT #1
Pieces of a pager oxidized with
trace elements of Semtex.
Probably the triggering device.
They dial it up, probably from a
cell phone, and boom...
He picks up a microchip.
FORENSIC EXPERT #1
... This is the memory chip. I
can build it into a working pager
and maybe get a number readout.
PHIPPS
Do it.
Phipps moves to the next work area, where another
FORENSIC EXPERT studies video from a consulate
surveillance camera.
20.
52
ON SCREEN
52
in super slow-mo, we see a cop -- the one who later
bumped into Gordy -- in front of the consulate. His hat
is pulled down over his eyes, almost concealing his
tinted glasses. As the cop faces more toward the camera,
the expert freeze-frames. To Phipps --
53
FORENSIC EXPERT #2
53
FORENSIC EXPERT #2
That's as much face as we get. He
was careful to duck the camera.
PHIPPS
Run a total analysis. I want to
know if this asshole's right or
left-handed. I want everything
you can get outta this film.
Phipps keeps moving, enters an eerie recreation of the
blast site. Streets, buildings, etc. are marked out on
the garage floor. Pieces of the Navigators rest in front
of the area marked "consulate;" parts of an NYPD traffic
scooter rest in front of the Navigators; "X's" mark where
Anne and Matt were standing.
Phipps crosses to another AGENT.
PHIPPS
Any helpful information coming
outta Colombia?
AGENT
Not yet. Sat-Intel hasn't picked
up any related data-traffic,
either.
Dray walks up.
DRAY
Gordon Pitt's here. He says he
saw a cop at the scene.

The cop tickets a vehicle, then walks west out of frame.
PHIPPS
The bomb's in the cart.
56
PHIPPS

reverses the video, freeze-frames on the cop.
PHIPPS
We think the bomb was triggered by
a cell phone. The guy doesn't
have one in his hands here. Did
you see a cell phone when you ran
into him?
GORDY
... No.
PHIPPS
How much time passed between then
and the explosion?
GORDY
... Seconds... Five, ten...
PHIPPS
We think maybe he got into the
brown Ford. You see him then?
GORDY
All I cared about was getting to
my wife and boy.

Guy still had enough time to get
out a phone and dial it in.

... The bombing that left a mother
and son dead and New York City
numb took on a new dimension today
when a notorious Latin American
terrorist took credit for the
attack.
23.
61
GORDY
61
has roused from his despondency, TURNS UP the VOLUME as
the report (containing visuals) continues --
62
NEWS ANCHOR
62
NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
In an e-mail to the New York
Times, a Marxist extremist known
only as 'The Wolf,' states that
the bombing was, quote, 'not an
act of terror but an act of war,
aimed at stopping your C.I.A.
murderers and their fascist puppets
from committing further acts of
repression against the people of
Colombia,' unquote... Two
Colombian officials and an
American military officer died
in last Thursday's blast. Also
killed were Anne Pitt, wife of a
New York City firefighter, and
their only child, four-year-old
Matt... The President has vowed
that the United States will avenge
what he called 'this monstrous act
of barbarism and cowardice'...
Intelligence sources say the
identity and whereabouts of The
Wolf remain a mystery. They
believe he has worked closely with
radical elements in Latin America
for more than twenty years and
have linked him to numerous
terrorist bombings, including the
1983 downing of a Peruvian
airliner, which killed forty-two
people, eleven of them
Americans... The head of the Latin
America Indigenous People's
Committee, a group known to be
sympathetic to the radicals in
Colombia, talked to News Six in
Queens.

forties, comes on the screen.

64
ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ
64
ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ (V.O.)
I cannot speak for The Wolf or his
actions. I would only repeat that
the leftist guerrillas in Colombia
are not terrorists but freedom
fighters in a war being waged
against them by the U.S. and
Colombian governments.
Governments who wish only to
protect a system that lines the
pockets of corrupt politicians and
multi-national profiteers.
(jump cut)
The deaths of the woman and little
boy are regrettable, but your
government inflicts them all the
time. Yugoslavia, Iraq... You
call it 'collateral damage'...
65

An FBI SURVEILLANCE TEAM has taken over the office.
Three agents work video and audio recording devices.
A camera points out the window to a line of storefronts
across the street. The lights are on in one building
with a sign reading "IPC" (Indigenous People's Committee).
The FBI agents listen to live audio from the IPC office.
ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ (V.O.)
Rosetta, I said mustard on the
side. You'll have to go back.
FBI SURVEILLANCE AGENT
Know what cracks me up about
commies? They're all 'equality
this, equality that,' and they're
all chauvinists. Listen to that
fucking guy.
What they hear, however, is ROSETTA SCREAM as a DOOR
CRASHES open.
ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ (V.O.)
What do you want?
GLASS SHATTERS. THINGS are BROKEN.

Gordy approaches Ortiz-Dominguez with the bat.
Backs him
up against a desk.
ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ
Please...
The FBI agents crash in.
FBI SURVEILLANCE AGENT
Mr. Pitt!
Gordy just stares down at Ortiz-Dominguez.
FBI SURVEILLANCE AGENT
This isn't the way to do things.
Gordy still doesn't move.
FBI SURVEILLANCE AGENT
These guys're only mouthpieces.

Then Gordy swings the bat.
Hard.
And...
Destroys the computer monitor next to Ortiz-Dominguez.
Gordy tosses the bat aside.
To the shaking Latin --
GORDY
How's that for collateral damage?

Gordy sits across from Phipps.
Dray is present.
PHIPPS
Mr. Ortiz-Dominguez has agreed not

BRANDT
I'm very sorry for your loss... I
lost people, too.
PHIPPS
... Mike was in the motorcade that
day... He's the chief U.S.
intelligence officer overseeing
Colombia.
BRANDT
Don't worry, Mr. Pitt, we're gonna
get the son-of-a-bitch.
GORDY
You know where he is?
BRANDT
We believe The Wolf's in hiding
in an area of Colombia controlled
by the E.L.C., extreme Marxist
guerrillas... He thinks he's in
a safe haven.
Brandt lets "thinks" sink in.
PHIPPS
I know it's hard for you right
now, Mr. Pitt. We're all sorry.
But why don't you go home.
We're taking care of things.
Beat.
Brandt proffers a business card.
BRANDT
Here's my card. Call me any time.
Gordy takes it.
Just sits there a long moment, then --
GORDY
What kind of twisted people do
things like this?
Beat.
Brandt and Phipps don't have an answer.

Gordy talks to a Latin reporter, ERNIE OROSCO.
OROSCO
You interested in the big picture
or all the unpleasant details?
GORDY
My family died because of what's
going on down there. I want to
know all I can.
Orosco searches for a starting point.
Then --
OROSCO
Well, basically, the situation in
Colombia sucks...
As Orosco continues...
70
MONTAGE - DAY/NIGHT
70
Over the course of a week:
1. Gordy takes pictures, etc., off a wall in his home.
He pins up photos of Anne and Matt at the top of the
wall. Beneath them he pins up a large map of Colombia.
OROSCO (V.O.)
... The government's been fighting
different Marxists factions for
over thirty-five years. For most
of that time, it was winning...
71
NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY
71
2. At the New York Public Library, Gordy uses microfilm
files and computer access to the web to search out
information on Colombia and The Wolf.
OROSCO (V.O.)
... Suddenly the guerrillas began
chopping 'em up. High-tech
weapons and equipment, well-
trained troops, aggressive hit-
and-run tactics, all financed by
extortion, kidnapping and
collecting taxes from dope
growers. It's big money, and they
put it to use...
28.
72
GORDY
72
3. Gordy pins up various Colombia-related articles and
pictures on the wall, including the surveillance camera still of
The Wolf from the front page of The New York Post.
OROSCO (V.O.)
... The government got scared. In
1998, to jump start peace talks,
it gave a coalition of guerrilla
groups temporary control over much
of southern Colombia... The first
communist stronghold on an
American continent...
73
GORDY
73
4.
Gordy draws a line around the guerrilla zone.
OROSCO (V.O.)
... But there've been few talks
and no peace. And the Colombian
military can't get near the
guerrilla zone, especially around
the town of Caguan, where the
E.L.C. kicks ass and takes no
prisoners...
74
GORDY
74
5.
Gordy circles and labels the ELC-controlled area.
OROSCO (V.O.)
... And that's where we come in.
Supposedly, to help eliminate
narcos operating in the guerrilla
zone. But some well-informed
people think that's just an excuse
to hit the guerrillas themselves,
since they're wrapped around the
drug trade... We're there, we're
involved... If we stay, the only
real question is which Vietnam War
we're gonna have. The one some
feel we could've won or the one we
lost...
75
GORDY

6. Gordy watches a documentary about Colombia which
shows rebels, army troops, death squads, firefights, and with
atrocities and bodies on both sides.

OROSCO (V.O.)
... Bottom line? The place is as
dangerous as a snakepit. You've
got the different guerrilla groups,
C.I.A., F.B.I., D.E.A., Colombian
military, U.S. military, right-
wing death squads -- and the only
thing they've all managed to do is
destroy a beautiful country and
inflict suffering on the real
people... Hey, I'm Colombian, and
I'll never go back...
OFF Gordy's packed wall...

SAME SCENE - ANOTHER DAY

As Gordy closes the front door, REVEAL Mike, the
firefighter, who's just come in and now stands staring at
the wall, clearly whelmed by the level of compulsion this
must have required.
MIKE
Haven't heard from you in a couple
days.
GORDY
Been busy.
MIKE
Yeah.
I can see that.
Gordy's obsessed, totally consumed by his project.
He
points at a picture of heavily-armed guerrillas.
GORDY

Gordy indicates a newspaper article.
GORDY
Thirteen dead in a bus.

Yeah.
Let's go tell him that.
Gordy doesn't react.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR (V.O.)
Today, at 0700 hours Eastern
Daylight Time, a joint United
States/Colombian strike force
launched a full-scale assault at a
base camp of the Army of Colombian
Liberation, or E.L.C., in Southern
Colombia. The purpose of the
mission was to punish the people
behind the brutal bombing in New
York City ten days ago... We are
presently evaluating after-action

Big cheers now. Toasts all around. Everyone in the

The Dalmatian whizzes on the hydrant outside.
Sal plays chess in the open door with the neighbor kid.
Ronnie polishes chrome on the truck.
Gordy holds up the broken remains of his ice cream maker
as Junior looks on.
GORDY
I'm gone three weeks and this
place falls apart.
JUNIOR
The temp lieutenant put it out
back, and Art hit it with his
truck.
RONNIE
(calls to Gordy)
We're having problems with the
portable pump again, too.
GORDY
Who backed over that?... My tools
still here?
SAL
Upstairs in your locker.
GORDY
Figured you guys would've sold my
stuff at a yard sale by now.

Art's sleeping. Gordy opens his locker. There are old
pictures of Anne and Matt still taped inside. He glances
at them quickly, then pulls out his tools.
82
82
Mike's channel-surfing again. Gordy goes by the door,
carrying his tools and looks in.
GORDY
You ever stay on one channel long
enough to hear what they're
saying?
Whereupon Mike lands on CNN.
CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
-- a surprise today --
And then we're on another channel.
GORDY
Go back!
Go back!
MIKE
What?
But Gordy has charged in and grabs the remote from Mike,
switches channels back to CNN.
83
ON SCREEN
83
we see a CNN anchor with an over-the-shoulder graphic
showing the still of the cop from the consulate
surveillance camera with "The Wolf" superimposed.
CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
... videotape from the terrorist
who calls himself The Wolf...
On screen, we now see a homemade video of a masked figure
wearing a camo floppy hat and a hunter's mesh face mask
with a strange-smiling face painted on it in camo earth
tones. The Wolf's body is hidden shadow, the voice
digitally altered to a deep bass growl.
THE WOLF (V.O.)
You thought you killed me. You
didn't. I'm still here...
We see Gordy's demeanor shift, retreating to the
obsessive, seething hatred he showed before.

THE WOLF (V.O.)
... I swear that for every freedom
fighter you killed, ten Americans

The Wolf slaps his palm for emphasis.
THE WOLF (V.O.)
... Venceremos.
The tape ends.
Mike shakes his head.
MIKE
This guy, Quaddafi, that Bin
Laden... We never get these
assholes.
OFF Gordy, his spark of life suddenly extinguished...

83B
Brandt's on the phone.
He's pissed.
BRANDT
... Senator, the failure of one
operation shouldn't cause your
committee to question financing
everything else we're doing down
there...
DONALD UPDEGRAF, Brandt's number two, enters.
BRANDT
... I know it looks bad, and I
appreciate your support.
Together we'll get it done...
Yeah. 'bye.
(hangs up; to
Updegraf)
Without his father's money, that
asshole'd be keeping bees for a

I don't need it.

Updegraf picks up the phone.
UPDEGRAF
Mr. Pitt, Mr. Brandt'll have to
get back to you.
84
84
Gordy's mood is dark. It's not improved by hearing the
bullshit in Updegraf's reply.
GORDY
Tell him not to bother.
He slams down the phone. Rips up Brandt's business card.
He's alone with his frustration, with his rekindled
hatred and rage. OFF Gordy, glaring at the photo of The
Wolf on his wall...

CUSTOMS AREA - DAY
Armed police lead Rottweilers through the newly-arrived
passengers. FIND Gordy in line. He wears jeans, polo
shirt, Timberlands, carries a backpack.
Gordy advances to an IMMIGRATION OFFICER, hands over his
documents. The agent studies Gordy's passport.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
Business or pleasure, senor?
GORDY
... Pleasure.
The agent looks up at Gordy.
Looks back at the passport.
Beat.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER
One moment, senor.
The agent gets the attention of an IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR,

Superior looks over at Gordy. Then approaches.
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
If you would come with me,
please.
86
86
GORDY
Is there a problem?
The customs Superior closes the door.
Beat.
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
We know who you are, Mr. Pitt.
GORDY
Says so right there in my
passport.
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
We're aware your wife and child
were killed in the bombing in New
York.
(off Gordy's look)
We have C.N.N. here, too.
(then)
It's better for you to visit
another country. For your own
sake.
GORDY
... You giving me a choice?
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
Yes. But not about staying in
Colombia.
He opens the door, addresses two armed policemen in
Spanish. Turning back to Gordy --
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
These men will escort you onto
whatever flight you wish.
He holds out Gordy's passport.
Beat.
Gordy takes it,
starts out. As he goes --

IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR
It's The Wolf you're after, yes?
Gordy stops, turns back. He says nothing, but the look
on his face speaks volumes.
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR

bigger favor than you know.
Gordy doesn't respond.
Just turns and goes.
87
87
DAY
Gordy's flanked by the armed policemen, one with a
Rottweiler. As they walk, a PA announcement in Spanish
is repeated in English...
PA ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)
... Avianco flight 42 to Panama

Avianca flight 42 to Panama City
is now open for boarding.
OFF Gordy, having heard the announcement --
88
98
One of the colorful, wretchedly overcrowded buses that
ply Colombia's back-country roads.
As the chiva jolts and shudders over the dirt road, Gordy
sleeps. He's an object of some curiosity -- not only a
gringo, but a virtual Gulliver in comparison to the
small-statured Colombians pressed in around him.
99

Full of manned hi-tech command-and-control and
surveillance equipment. A Colombian military operations
officer, ROCHA, waits with an aide.

All due respect, Noel, it's not

Updegraf has had papers handed to him and interrupts --
UPDEGRAF
Check this out.
He hands a paper to Brandt.
Brandt reads it.
BRANDT
Jesus Christ...
UPDEGRAF
(to Rocha)
The man whose wife and son died in
New York. One of your units found
his passport and credit cards on
some gunrunners near Panama.
Gunrunners say they left him
alive.
BRANDT
What, he thinks he can get The
Wolf himself?
ROCHA
We have too much time and too many
people invested to have a loose
cannon walking around.
BRANDT
(beat; hands papers

Throw out the net. Have him
picked up... Just make sure no one
kills him.
FLASH-CUT TO:
101
EXPLOSION

Boom!
An ENORMOUS EXPLOSION.
And...

102

Gordy bolts awake from the nightmare with a scream. He
looks around at the startled faces in the crowded bus,
unsure where he is for a moment before he gets his
bearings. The dream lingers, depressing him.

An oncoming bus flashes its headlights. As the buses

keeps going. Gordy's chiva slows to a crawl, and the
Driver calls back.
GORDY'S CHIVA DRIVER
Inspecion militar. Chequeo de

Various passengers gather their things and begin to
disembark in a hurry. To anyone who'll answer --
GORDY
Habla Ingles?... Que pasa?
A MAN IN A YANKEES CAP is among the people getting off.
He answers in accented English.
MAN IN YANKEES CAP
There is a military checkpoint up

The man heads into the forest.

Gordy follows.

Gordy sees a sign for a town as the chiva rumbles along.
He pulls out his map.

Gordy finds the town, which lies along a river. He
traces a road from the town. The road runs south through
the town of Mompos, and eventually reaches Caguan, the
ELC capital.

A COLOMBIAN WOMAN is looking over Gordy's shoulder.

FEDERALES

blast through the bar.
134
GORDY
134
runs, jumps, launches off a beer keg, and...
135
TOP OF WALL
135
He reaches the top of the wall and pulls himself up.
He's looking out across a block-long run of corrugated
tin roofs. Takes off across the roofs, each step
thundering, as...
136
FEDERALES
136
burst into the courtyard. Two men hastily build a stack
of boxes, etc., against the wall.
137
GORDY
137
runs as fast as he can across the rooftops, when...
A section of roof gives way beneath his feet, just as...
138
NEW ANGLE

One of the federales finally mounts the wall, looks
across the rooftops... and Gordy's gone.
139
GORDY
139
lands inside a warehouse room amid sacks of rice, beans
and coffee. The building is dark and dusty. He lies
still and listens. FOOTSTEPS approach across the tin
roof overhead. Gordy burrows into the bags of rice,
pulls them over him.
56.
140
FEDERALE
140
on the roof peers down through the hole. Scans the
warehouse room below with a mini-Mag-Lite.

GORDY

sees the flashlight beam move past. He holds his breath.
Beat. Then the FOOTSTEPS pass on, RECEDE down the roof.
And Gordy can breathe again.
142
143
In here, the MUSIC'S LOUD ROCK 'N' ROLL. Gringo music
for a gringo bar. The place is busy, with plenty of
local "hostesses" for the men. Even Armstrong, standing
half-crocked at the bar, is flanked by two scantily-clad
women. He's got a spoon hanging off his nose. So does one
of the girls. Armstrong's trying to hang a spoon on the
other.
Gordy slips into the bar. Spots Armstrong through the
crowd. Sees Armstrong's not wearing his cap, when...
The girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly,
revealing she's wearing the cap. It's on backwards, but
now Gordy can see the "Deerborn" logo clearly.
Gordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap.
It's a desperate move, but he's got no choice. Starts
toward the girl, when...
Gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door. The
thin federale sees him at the same time. Begins moving
in on him.
Gordy moves faster toward the girl.
And...
The girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the
cap and setting it on the bar, where it's easier to grab,
and then turns her attention to Armstrong's antics.
The thin detective fights through the crowd after Gordy.
Gordy's almost to the hat.
(CONTINUED)
57.
143
CONTINUED:
143
Armstrong's still having trouble with the second girl's
spoon.
ARMSTRONG
I never met a nose I couldn't hang
a spoon on.
Gordy reaches the bar, snags the cap. Glances back, sees
the thin federale closing in, turns to run out the back,
when...
A strong hand stops him. The hand belongs to the Fat
Federale. And now the thin federale's there, too,
wielding a stun gun where Gordy can see it. People in
the bar fall silent. Everyone but Armstrong, who's
finally hung the spoon on the second girl's nose.
ARMSTRONG
Yahtzee!
And now Armstong also realizes something's up. Turns and
sees Gordy. Sees the cap in Gordy's hand as the Fat
Federale addresses Gordy --
FAT FEDERALE
Come along, Mr. Pitt.
Whereupon Armstrong shouts drunkenly at Gordy --
ARMSTRONG
Police catch you trying to steal
my hat, you asshole?!
He staggers toward Gordy.
Grabs the hat.
ARMSTRONG
Fucking hat thief!
Armstrong takes a drunken swing at Gordy, but...
Instead of hitting Gordy, Armstrong accidentally-on-
purpose clocks the fat detective. Then hisses into
Gordy's ear, clearly not that drunk --
ARMSTRONG
Get outta here --
But then Armstrong's legs won't work as the thin federale
jams the stun gun against his neck, and 10,000 volts
surprise the Armstrong neural network.
Gordy moves against the thin federale in anger, when...
The Fat Federale ZAPS him with another STUN GUN, just
behind the ear... And Gordy gets to know the floor, too.
58.
144
145
The jail might be old, but the cells are secure enough.
They're also unsanitary and thoroughly unpleasant.
Gordy and Armstrong are led in by the federales. The Fat
Federale has Armstrong's hat. He looks it over,
wondering why Gordy wanted it. Then decides he could
give a fuck and tosses it to Armstrong. Clangs the cell
door shut and locks it. Leaves shaking his head.
FAT FEDERALE
Gringos...
Armstrong's still unsteady on his feet and sits down on
the metal bunk.
ARMSTRONG
That stun gun wasn't cool.
Armstrong looks down at himself.
ARMSTRONG
Haven't peed my pants in a real
long time.
GORDY
(beat)
You shouldn't have helped me.
ARMSTRONG
Yeah, well, I guess all these
assholes down here are just
starting on my nerves.
Gordy's silent.
It's over.
He's come up short.
He's
going home.
ARMSTRONG
So what the hell did you do to
land us in here? And don't jerk
me around, eh?
Beat.
Gordy sits.
GORDY
The Wolf killed my wife and son
in New York.
(CONTINUED)
59.
145
CONTINUED:
145
ARMSTRONG
... Oh, you're that guy, eh? I'm
sorry, man... And what, you came
down here to even things out?
Gordy just looks at him.
ARMSTRONG
Did you even have a plan?
GORDY
Yeah. Go to Caguan, find The Wolf
and kill him.
Armstrong just shakes his head.
Beat.
146
DOOR TO CELL AREA
146
BANGS open. Federales lead in two men -- the two
guerrillas surprised earlier by the heavy-camouflaged
infiltrators. The federales are armed with batons and
stun guns, taking no chances. It's clear the rebels
weren't brought here without a struggle, either -- both
are cut and bruised. The tougher-looking of the two has
taken a real beating. This beaten man is jammed face-
first against the bars of Gordy's cell. He makes eye
contact with Gordy while the other rebel is unbound and
put into a cell. Then the beaten man is shoved into the
cell. A solid, brick wall separates them from Gordy and
Armstrong. Armstrong's seen the patches on their
uniforms. To Gordy, sotto --
ARMSTRONG
E.L.C.
Beat. Armstrong sees the look on Gordy's face.
By way
of a warning --
ARMSTRONG
If you can't kill them, don't even
talk to them.
The GUERRILLAS are MURMURING in the other cell. One of
them LAUGHS. OFF Gordy, listening to the LAUGHING...
147
147
Two or three A.M. Armstrong's dozing. Gordy's still
listening to the MURMURING of the REBELS on the other
side of the wall, when...
(CONTINUED)
60.
147
CONTINUED:
147
There's a flurry of activity outside the cell area.
The
door opens. Soldiers enter with some federales.
Gordy watches the soldiers move past his cell.
Rocha is
with them. And then...
Brandt appears at the bars, looks in at Gordy.
BRANDT
Enjoy your trip?
Gordy stands, approaches.
BRANDT
We asked you to leave it to us.
GORDY
And you guys still haven't got
him.
BRANDT
It's not over yet... The guys next
door are in The Wolf's elite
bodyguard unit. Where he goes,
they go. We're gonna ask
questions. And we're gonna get
answers... And you're staying
right here till our bomber's dead.
Brandt goes. Moments later, a TORTURED SCREAM is heard
on the other side of the brick wall, waking Armstrong
with a start.
148
153
People react to the sounds of the MORTAR ATTACK on the
town. The lights go out. Brandt, Rocha and their men
quickly lock the guerrillas in their cell and head out.
154
155
KA-BOOM! The front door and wall of the jail
disintegrate under the multiple LAW attack.
156
NEW ANGLE
156
Brandt, Rocha and the soldiers, approaching the front
door inside, are hammered by the massive concussion of
the BLAST and flung across the room, apparently dead.
157
ANOTHER ANGLE
157
The powerful, concussive shock-wave channels into the
cell area. Gordy's slightly protected by a wall.
Armstrong, standing at the bars, is thrown into the
opposite wall and knocked unconscious.
158
GUERRILLAS
158
charge inside with AKs BLAZING.
Surviving soldiers and
federales SHOOT back.
The blasts have caused fires in the building. Severed
wires spark, creating more fire. Flames begin to spread
through the tinder-dry structure.
(CONTINUED)
62.
158
CONTINUED:
158
The guerrillas take out the soldiers and federales, with
few casualties to themselves. They make their way toward
the cell area.
EXPLODING AMMO and stored FUEL CANS accelerate the fire.
159
NEW ANGLE
159
The guerrillas reach the cells. Two men see Gordy and
draw down on him. The others move to the next cell.
Guerrillas plant small explosive charges on the hinges of
the cell containing their two captured comrades. Beat.
The HINGES BLOW. The beaten man and the rebel with him
are freed, and the guerrillas quickly retreat the way
they came.
Gordy sees flames spreading into the cell area.
160
GUERRILLAS
160
exit the fiery jail past Brandt.
We see Brandt's not
dead.
161
168
A severely-dazed Brandt, bleeding from the nose and ears,
slowly gets to his knees, crawls out of the burning
building and collapses outside.
169
169
There's fire and smoke everywhere. Gordy picks up the
metal bunk and slams it against a wall. Slams it again.
Breaks the metal apart. Then levers a long side rail in
the cell door. He heaves. Heaves again. The fire's
licking at him, but Gordy's undeterred. He heaves again,
and...
This time, the door gives. Gordy picks up Armstrong's
cap, then picks up Armstrong, who's starting to come
around. Puts Armstrong over his shoulders in a fireman's
carry.
GORDY
Don't breathe.
ARMSTRONG
(weakly)
You're not running through the
fire, eh?
GORDY
Close your mouth.
Because running through the fire is just what Gordy's
gonna do. As he disappears into the flames...
170
177
The ELC SUPERVISOR for Caguan may be a Marxist, but the
clean, well-ordered office is nicely appointed, with a
big-screen Sony and leather furniture. The TV's TUNED TO
CNN. A photo on the wall depicts him as a younger man
wearing guerrilla cammies bearing with an ELC patch and
holding an AK-47. A brass nameplate reading "Supervisor"
rests on a neat desk, behind which stands the man himself
-- a hardened, former guerrilla fighter proud of his
position. He's not in cammies now -- his uniform now
consists of casual but nice tropical clothing and a fat
Rolex.
Felix is a subordinate here. He and Gordy stand across
the desk as the Supervisor examines Gordy's travel pass.
Gordy's nervous about what could appear on the TV in the
b.g., but tries not to show it.
ELC SUPERVISOR
Your passport was stolen.
GORDY
In Mompos.
ELC SUPERVISOR
... Mompos is a shithole. Not
like Caguan... Why didn't
Armstrong come?
GORDY
He was arrested in Ecuador. He
got drunk and fooled around with a
police officer's wife.
The Supervisor just looks at him, assessing Gordy's face
for signs he's lying. Gordy's expression stays the same.
Felix respectfully interjects.
It's almost a plea.
FELIX
(in Spanish)
We need to fix the equipment. We
have delivery deadlines to meet.
(CONTINUED)
68.
177
CONTINUED:
177
A long beat. The ELC Supervisor hands the travel pass
back to Gordy. In a hard tone to Felix --
ELC SUPERVISOR
(in Spanish)
He's your responsibility. Don't
let him out of your sight.
FELIX
Si.
Gracias.
As Felix leads Gordy away...
178
178
Gordy and Felix pull away from the Supervisor's H.Q.
Felix resumes his former tone of command.
FELIX
The Supervisor made you my
responsibility... You don't go
anywhere without me, you
understand?
GORDY
No problemo.
Gordy peers out the window intently as they drive,
looking for a lucky break, looking for The Wolf,
searching the face of every man. He doesn't see The
Wolf, but what he does see surprises him. The ELC
Supervisor was right: Caguan's no Mompos. It's a third-
world town, armed troops are visible, and there's a lot
of bad shit behind Colombia's revolutionaries, but here
the streets are calm and orderly. It's quiet, almost
eerie, as people go about their business. OFF Gordy,
seeing another side of the guerrillas...
179
179
Felix turns off at the entrance to a lane leading to the
plantation. The entrance is guarded by a 4X4 "Rat
Patrol" assault truck and four heavily armed ELC
guerrillas.
GORDY
The E.L.C. guards your coffee
beans?
Felix thinks he's joking. Until he looks over and sees
Gordy's actually being sincere.
(CONTINUED)
69.
179
CONTINUED:
179
FELIX
... Coffee beans? Shit.
Armstrong didn't tell you much...
180
180
They approach a hacienda and outbuildings. The
accoutrements of agriculture are present -- tractors,
sheds, cats, etc. -- but clearly, this is no family farm.
There are lots of serious-looking men around. More ELC
guerrillas stand guard.
181
FELIX
181
stops the car. He and Gordy get out. Felix begins
leading Gordy toward two rows of long, open-walled sheds.
FELIX
The problem's with the diesel
generators. The sons-of-bitches
keep breaking down.
182
NEW ANGLE
182
They pass four very large pits, where green leaves steep
in a thick, foul-smelling liquid.
FELIX
We're using portables to keep
production going, but they don't
supply enough power to the heat
lamps, and we have to dry a lot
of... 'coffee beans.'
183
ANOTHER ANGLE
183
They're now walking between the two rows of sheds, where
portable gas GENERATORS THRUM, and...
Gordy can see long, wide platforms inside. Above the
platforms are multiple arrays of powerful heat lamps.
Spread out and drying beneath them is a half-acre or two
of converted cocaine.
184
IN ANOTHER SHED
184
workers pack and wrap one-kilo bricks of coke for
shipment.
70.
185
GORDY AND FELIX
185
approach the two giant diesel generators.
FELIX
We can fix anything, but these
keep dying on us... You'll start
now. I'll have tools brought to
you.
(beat)
Armstrong's a magician with them.
Let's hope you have his skill.
Felix walks over to a guerrilla with an AK-47 and speaks
to him. Then goes. Whereupon the guerrilla crosses to
Gordy and takes up a sentry position over him.
186
SAME SCENE - LATER
186
Gordy has the diesels partially dismantled. The
guerrilla sentry is still right there. Felix returns.
FELIX
Well?
Gordy has to think of something fast.
Beat.
He throws a
machine part against a wall angrily.
GORDY
I can't work with these pieces of
junk.
FELIX
Junk? These generators cost a
fortune.
GORDY
Then treat them that way.
FELIX
(beat, then)
Armstrong always fixes them.
GORDY
Armstrong wants your money. He
makes them work, but he doesn't
fix them... To do this right, we
gotta order parts from Europe.
In the meantime, I can make
something temporary. There must
be a machine shop in town.
FELIX
... Yes.
(CONTINUED)
71.
186
CONTINUED:
186
Gordy stands.
GORDY
Let's go.
OFF Felix, forced to acquiesce...
187
187
Felix is driving. Again, Gordy uses the opportunity to
look for The Wolf. It's a long-shot, and he knows it.
But it's all he can do.
188
EMPTY STOREFRONT
188
They pass an empty storefront. A sign on the large,
front plate glass window says "Cine" and "Sabado."
189
BAR
189
They pass a bar. Felix watches it go by with something
like a look of desire. Gordy registers the look and the
connection to the bar.
190
190
Gordy selects spare parts.
A clerk wraps the parts in an old newspaper, and...
Gordy realizes his picture is on the paper.
He smears
grease from his hands over it.
191
192
They've had a lot more than two beers. Felix has,
anyway. He's drunk. He's also in love with a waitress
on his lap, a cute gordita named BERTA. He pats her.
FELIX
This is mine. This is the reason
I come here... right, Berta? Me
amas?
BERTA
(playing along)
Si, amor.
Somebody whistles for a drink, and Berta goes.
FELIX
... She's hot, isn't she?
GORDY
Yeah.
Long beat.
Gordy makes the play he's been contemplating.
GORDY
Armstrong said to watch my butt
around here. I guess the fucking
Americans come down and shoot
everyone all the time.
FELIX
Especially now, since the bomb in
New York.
(CONTINUED)
73.

CONTINUED:
192
GORDY
Yeah, I heard about it.
Who did
it?
Felix is just loose enough.
FELIX
The Wolf, and they'll never catch
him.
GORDY
Ever see him?
FELIX
Once.
GORDY
Where?
FELIX
(beat; eyes Gordy)
If you know too much around here,
it can get you killed.
Gordy's gotten all he'll get from Felix.
He feigns
nonchalance, smiles.
GORDY
Tell me what doesn't get you
killed around here.
Gordy takes a swig of beer.
When...
Gordy sees the Beaten Man from the jail in Mompos.
The
man has just walked in with another guerrilla.
Gordy barely avoids being seen as the guerrillas cross
the room. At the bar, the bartender puts out two crates
of beer. The guerrillas take the beer and head out. No
money's changed hands. When they're gone, to Felix --
GORDY
We'd better get back, huh?
FELIX
(checks his watch)
... Shit. It's late.
193
194
Gordy gets in. Felix hands Gordy the keys.
Then slumps
against his door and closes his eyes.
FELIX
One day, I'm going to screw Berta.
Gordy STARTS the CAR and drives after the Suburban.
195
195
Gordy follows the Suburban as Felix rambles --
FELIX
... I'll take her to a small
restaurant... We'll have lobster
and drink lots of wine... I'll get
her drunk... We'll drive home...
I'll carry her inside... I'll kiss
her... And then, I'll screw her in
my bed...
The Suburban pulls up next to a house.
There are armed
guerrilla guards outside.
FELIX
... And when I am done screwing
her, she'll never want to look at
another man again...
Gordy drives past the house as the Beaten Man and the
guerrilla with him get out of the Suburban and start
carrying the beer inside. And a moment later...
Felix comes around with a start.
FELIX
What the fuck are you doing?!
He unholsters the 9mm and points it at Gordy.
GORDY
Hey, easy... What's the problem?
(CONTINUED)
75.
195
CONTINUED:
195
FELIX
You're going the wrong goddamn
way!
GORDY
I am?... Looks different in the
dark...
FELIX
Turn around!
Gordy turns the car around.
Felix keeps the gun on him.
FELIX
You drive where I say... Or the
Supervisor will have us both shot.
Gordy drives back. They approach the Suburban and the
house once more. This time it's on Felix' side. Felix
gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and...
Gordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the
other way: a large propane tank next to the house.
196
201
They pass the "Cine" in the storefront. The ELC
Supervisor's big-screen TV is being wheeled in.
202
GORDY
202
sees an attractive woman playing with some children.
203
GORDY AND FELIX
203
drive past the bar.
Gordy notices Felix doesn't even
glance at it.
GORDY
Berta working today?
FELIX
Ha!
Puta!
We see that, whatever this means, it's an unexpected
complication for Gordy.
204
204
Gordy chooses the spare part.
The clerk wraps the part in newspaper.
78.
205
206
Gordy climbs in.
Felix starts driving.
Gordy's down to
final straws.
GORDY
We can't stop for one beer?
FELIX
There's beer at the plantation.
GORDY
(thinking fast)
There's no Berta at the
plantation. I like drinking beer
around pretty girls, not a bunch
of guys with automatic rifles.
FELIX
To hell with Berta.
GORDY
What happened? Last night you
were in love with her.
There's a beat. Felix glances at Gordy.
Decides it's
safe to confide.
FELIX
... I had a dream... I fed her
lobster, got her drunk, and she
rejected me for another man.
(off Gordy's look)
Dreams tell the future.
GORDY
... That wasn't a dream, that was
the alcohol talking... You saying
two men can't go have a beer and
look at women's breasts because
of pink elephants?... Nothing
makes any sense down here.
(CONTINUED)
79.
206
CONTINUED:
206
Felix pulls out his .9mm.
Gordy doesn't blink an eye.
GORDY
Go ahead and shoot me, and you
fix the goddamn generator. Part's
in the back.
Beat.
OFF Felix, thinking it all over...
207
207
A replay of last night. Felix is pretty wasted.
Berta's
in his lap again. In Spanish --
FELIX
You know I'm your man, baby.
Someone whistles for a drink. Berta starts to stand.
Gordy slips her twenty US dollars to stay. She does.
GORDY
I have to piss.
Gordy crosses, exits into the bano.
208
209
Gordy gets the grenade from the tool box. He slides it
just inside the top of his pants, with the spoon hooked
over the waistband. He finds some wire. Then searches
for something else. Finds a piece of string and checks
its length. From Gordy's reaction, we understand it's
too short.
Gordy opens doors and checks seat pockets. Nothing. He
checks the glove box. No long string there, either. But
he does find two rubber bands. Gordy studies them a
moment, thinking. Tests their elasticity. Then pulls
out the Zippo and thumbs it. The lighter still works.
As Gordy pockets everything and walks off...
210
213
The guerrilla patrol has taken Gordy to Felix, still
sitting with Berta in his lap.
FELIX
Are you trying to get us both
killed?
GORDY
I went for a walk. I figured you
wanted to be alone with Berta.
(CONTINUED)
81.
213
CONTINUED:
213
FELIX
(to the guerrillas;
in Spanish)
I'll make sure he's on a shorter
leash.
The patrol leader looks at Felix hard. Then nods. The
guerrillas go. Felix dumps Berta onto her feet, stands.
Felix looks at Gordy, shakes his head.
FELIX
Shit...
214
214
Gordy and Felix get in.
FELIX
You're working all night,
Beckmann. That generator gets
fixed, and you're out of my hair
in the morning.
Felix jams the car in drive.
Gordy looks down, sees the spoon of the grenade exposed.
As he readjusts his shirt to cover the spoon...
215
216
Felix yanks the dangling cord and turns on the lights.
The room's a mess. All kinds of rubbish. There's a
washtub sink. There's a cot.
GORDY
This where Armstrong stays?
FELIX
This is where you stay... A boat
will take you down river at seven.
Felix closes the door. We hear a LOCK TURNING. Gordy
moves to the door and tries it. It's definitely locked.
Through a small window, he can see the lights in the
sheds and the ever-vigilant nighttime ELC sentries
patrolling the grounds. The DIESELS ROAR in the b.g.
Gordy turns back. Readjusts the grenade digging into his
belly, then hooks it back inside his pants. He turns off
the light. Moves to the adobe wall opposite the door.
THROUGH another small window, he can see it's dark in
this direction.
Gordy rummages through the refuse lying around the room.
We see some rubber tubing. We see some rope. Gordy
finally finds a piece of sharp metal. He moves to the
wall with the window. With the DIESELS covering the
noise, Gordy starts chiseling away at the adobe.
217
218
Gordy is making slow progress through the wall, when he
hears the VEHICLE arrive. He moves to the window by the
door and looks out. Sees the Suburban. Four guerrillas
are getting out, including the Beaten Man. Felix meets
them. The Beaten Man exchanges words with Felix. Felix
indicates Gordy's room. As the Beaten Man continues to
question Felix...
Gordy realizes he's fucked. He can't get through the
wall fast enough. His eyes go to water dripping from a
pipe leading to the washtub sink. He moves to it. Finds
the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap. Cranks
shut the master valve on the pipe. Wraps his hands
around the pipe and pulls. Nothing. Jams his feet
against the wall for leverage and pulls harder... And
this time, he yanks the pipe free from the sink. He
finds the rubber hose. Fits an end over the pipe.
(CONTINUED)
83.
218
CONTINUED:
218
Quickly lashes it on with some wire. Then cranks on the
master valve. High-pressure water streams from the hose.
Gordy sneaks a peek out the window. The Beaten Man's
still questioning Felix. The sound of the hose water is
being covered by the DIESELS.
Gordy crosses the room, extending the hose to the hole
he's made in the wall. He aims the stream at the hole.
Thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even
harder... And watches the jet begin eating away at the
old adobe and brick, just as it ate through the crumbling
plaster in the Spanish Harlem tenement.
219
220
Gordy's made progress, but hasn't broken through yet.
And he won't, not in enough time. Under his breath --
GORDY
Come on, baby... come on, baby...
And just then...
221
224
Gordy's gone. The Beaten Man signals two men to go out
the hole. To the other man --
BEATEN MAN
(in Spanish)
Organize the others. Find him.
The man goes. Outside, we hear him SHOUT orders to the
guerrillas guarding the plantation. The Beaten Man turns
to Felix. Felix is terrified. In a pleading tone --
FELIX
(in Spanish)
He can't be far. You'll catch --
BANG! The Beaten Man SHOOTS Felix in the head. Then
exits. OFF Felix, dead, his blood mixing with the water
still streaming across the floor...
225
262
Dark and dank. Excavated clay walls and floor. Heavy
door. A bare overhead bulb provides some light.
Gordy lies on a metal bed frame. One of his legs is
chained to the bed. He's in pain from being kicked --
but the physical aches are nothing compared to the
anguish he feels for having failed.
The door's unlocked and opens. Daylight streams in from
above as The Wolf enters with two guerrilla bodyguards.
He moves to the middle of the room. Looks at Gordy.
THE WOLF
One of the men in the jail with
you in Mompos is dying. He was
burned in your explosion.
Gordy just looks at him.
The Wolf signals a bodyguard, who crosses to Gordy and
frees his leg from the chain.
THE WOLF
You want to kill me? Come and
kill me.
The bodyguards are smiling. Gordy hesitates, then
springs for The Wolf, and...
The Wolf immediately fells him with a choppy-looking
karate combination. The Wolf's no Jet Li -- his style's
a throwback, even ugly, but it's well-practiced and
brutally effective. Even still, Gordy springs back right
away... and The Wolf drops him again.
THE WOLF
You Americans think you have all
the answers. And really, you're
so naive...
(CONTINUED)
92.
262
CONTINUED:
262
Gordy comes up swinging. Gordy's a barroom fighter. If
he can touch you, you're in trouble. He never gets
close. A vicious front kick folds him, and a fist drives
him to the floor. The Wolf stands over him.
THE WOLF
... You see one peasant with a
gun, and you never ask why he has
to have it. You just run to give
your billions to the nearest
soldiers, no matter how merciless
or corrupt they are.
The last kick really hurt Gordy.
He's slow rising.
THE WOLF
That's why I'm teaching America a
lesson... that's why there'll be
more bombs... and more families
like yours will pay the price.
The Wolf wants to pique him, but this is pouring gasoline
onto fire. Gordy explodes off the ground. The
suddenness and fury of the rush catch The Wolf off guard.
Gordy drives him backward. Slams him against a wall.
Then hooks an arm around the back of The Wolf's neck and
drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen.
All his weight behind the punches. Trying to break ribs
and crush them into The Wolf's heart, when...
A bodyguard slams the butt of an AK into Gordy's kidneys.
Gordy takes the blow standing. The guard delivers a
second, much harder shot, and Gordy drops to his knees in
agony. Beat. The Wolf recovers from the hammer-blows to
his midsection. And then...
He makes Gordy pay for the punches. Lands blow after
blow on Gordy's face. Beats the living shit out of
him... and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor.
263
BLACK
263
we hear a gentle CLACKING sound.
It's unidentifiable.
264
GORDY'S POV
264
The black becomes a BLUR. The BLUR becomes a hazy
glimpse of Selena. She's sitting on the metal bed frame
nursing Gordy's wounds. The CLACKING sound CONTINUES --
it's made by SEA SHELLS that dangle from a bracelet on
Selena's wrist. The shells knock together as she washes
Gordy's wounds.

SELENA
Are you alright?
265

Gordy's still in a deep fog from the beating, barely
there at all.
GORDY

SELENA
My name is Selena.
GORDY
... His wife?
SELENA
Yes.
Beat. The sea shells clack. Gordy loses consciousness
again, and everything goes...

The CLACKING sound CONTINUES.
And...
267
GORDY'S POV
267
This time, when Gordy opens his eyes, there's no
blurriness. It's a new day. He's better. Selena's
walking to him with a tray. The SHELL BRACELET CLACKS as
she approaches.
SELENA
I brought you food.
268
268
Gordy slowly sits up.
Beat.
GORDY
Why feed me?
Why not just kill
me?
SELENA
Are you so anxious to die?
Gordy doesn't have an answer.
Beat.
He tastes the meal.

268
GORDY
... Thanks.
Selena watches him a moment, troubled by something.
SELENA
The men in jail with you in
Mompos... They say you talked to a
man from the C.I.A.
GORDY
I'm not one of them.
I'm here for
my own reasons.
Selena watches him another moment. Decides he's telling
the truth. She reaches into a skirt pocket, then extends
her hand toward Gordy. He looks up. She's holding the
photo of Anne and Matt. Beat. Gordy takes the photo.
Looks at his wife and son. Selena sits next to him.
Another beat. Then, off the photo...
SELENA
Claudio used to be a teacher. I
was a medical aid worker. We met
in Guatemala, in an Indian village
called Guamaunco. We were married
there. Sophia, our daughter was
born there. Claudio was kind and
loving, and we were happy... We
were there four years when the
civil war broke out... The
guerrillas were all around us, but
left us alone... Then they made an
attack on the army nearby. The
next night, soldiers came to our
village. They were led by
American 'advisors'... They
accused us of helping the rebels.
Our women were raped. Our men
were tortured. Our homes were
burned... We crawled out into the
fields, but they threw grenades,
and Sophia...
Selena hesitates, choking back her emotions.
SELENA
... my baby girl was hit by
shrapnel... she bled to death in
Claudio's arms.
She looks into Gordy's eyes. The look says she
understands and shares Gordy's pain because she's
suffered her own painful loss. She looks away again.
(CONTINUED)

SELENA
Claudio joined the guerrillas.
When that war ended, we moved to
the next war, and the next... Each
fight has only deepened his
hatred. And poisoned his soul.
(beat)
He's unable to love anything
anymore...
GORDY
Why are you still here?
SELENA
Because I know he was a good man,
who's been consumed by rage
because of what he lost... Just
like you.
GORDY
I'm not like him.
SELENA
Not yet.
GORDY
He kills innocent people.
(then)
He's planning to kill more.
Beat. Selena suddenly stands, uncomfortable, not wanting
to discuss it. She goes to the door and knocks. OFF
Gordy, as the door opens, and Selena exits...

So that's what we're gonna do.
UPDEGRAF
We're gonna hit it?
BRANDT
We're not just gonna hit it, we're

Gordy's on the bed. The guard lets Selena in. She
crosses toward the food tray near Gordy... but she's not
there for the tray. Moves past it to Gordy's leg and, to
Gordy's surprise, begins unlocking the shackle.
SELENA
We're going with you.
When Gordy's free --
GORDY
How do we get out?
She hands Gordy a length of pipe secreted in her dress.
SELENA
The guard is the only one close.
When we're past him, we can slip
into the jungle. Mauro's waiting

Gordy moves to the right side of the door. Selena

L.O.H. PILOT

puts it on, Brandt sees her pack. Takes it and opens it.
He inspects it, then hands it back. Gordy glares at him.
Brandt meets his eyes. A long beat. Then --

He wasn't even there.
Brandt doesn't reply. Just holds the look a moment

Phipps wants to keep her positive and willing.

GORDY
Where're we going?
BRANDT
Inter-agency headquarters for our
efforts in Latin America.
PHIPPS
It's secure, and we can coordinate
all departments here.
OFF which, as they're swallowed up by the dark garage --
331
331
Brandt, Phipps, Dray, Selena and Gordy -- along with the
rest of the entourage -- walk through the interagency
nerve center. Gordy carries Mauro, still asleep.
They stop at the door to a large conference room.
Selena's ushered in. Gordy starts to follow. Phipps
stops him.
PHIPPS
My people will debrief you in
another room... We'll take the boy
to a safe house across the
street... He'll be well cared for.
Gordy exchanges a look with Selena. Beat. She nods her
reluctant approval. Gordy hands the boy to an agent.

Claudio opens the door of a cheap rental garage in an old
commercial strip. He steps inside. There's a rental van
and a big Ducati motorbike against a wall. Claudio
straps a black bag onto the bike, then rolls it out and
shuts the garage. Pulls on helmet and STARTS the BIKE.
As Claudio speeds into traffic --

DAY
Selena is seated at a table covered with photographs,
Washington, D.C. coffee table books, guide books, etc.
Brandt, Phipps, et al stand around her. Phipps flips
through the pages of a large coffee table book for Selena
to see.

SELENA
No... No... No...
That book's done.
SELENA
I'm sorry.
PHIPPS
That's okay.
He grabs another.
Opens it to the first photo.
SELENA
No...
334
334
A small conference room devoted to everything having to
do with the interagency interest in The Wolf. Photos of
evidence, time lines, charts, etc. cover the walls.
Gordy's tired, being debriefed by two FBI AGENTS.
FBI AGENT #1
... Did Claudio leave with anyone
else?
GORDY
I was underground. I couldn't see
anything.
FBI AGENT #1
Did you hear anything about his
contacts in the United States?
GORDY
No.
335
335
Security tightens all over the city.
Among the images we
see:
A forklift places huge planters -- really decorative
barricades -- to re-route traffic near vital buildings.
336
UNDERCOVER PEOPLE

with earpieces patrol public structures.
Some lead dogs
that sniff for explosives.

Phipps flips to the last photo in the book.
SELENA
... No...
He reaches for another book. As he does, he topples a
stack. Selena's eyes fix on one book cover.
SELENA
He had that book! Let me see it!
Phipps hands it to her. It's a guidebook to Washington.
Selena flips through it. Stops at a photo.
338
CLOSE ON PHOTO
338
It's of the redesigned lobby of Union Station.
339
BACK TO SCENE
339
Selena glances up.
SELENA
That's it!
BRANDT
Union Station.
PHIPPS
(to Dray)
Put it under total surveillance.
Get a bomb team in there with
dogs. Make 'em seeing-eye dogs if
you have to. And pull whatever
security video they have for the
last two days.
DRAY
Why not just shut it down?
PHIPPS
If we spook him, we don't know
what his secondary target'll be.
Dray gets on the horn.
Beat.
To Brandt and Phipps --
SELENA
Please don't kill him.
117.
340
341
Agents press the man hard to the floorboards. His bag's
tossed. It's empty. The guy's clean. It's not Claudio.
OFF the agents, holding an innocent man...

Selena watches as Phipps plays a surveillance video of
Union Station. Phipps suddenly freezes the image. Zooms
in on a man in the middle of the crowd. Claudio.
PHIPPS
That's him, isn't it?
SELENA
(hesitates, then)
Yes.
PHIPPS
He was there yesterday. Just
stood there and left... So far,
the dogs haven't found anything,
so maybe we're ahead of him.
BRANDT
What's he waiting for?
SELENA
He takes his time. Like he told
you, he enjoys it.
Beat. Selena's overwhelmed by the experience of seeing
her husband on the tape, by her betrayal of him. She
grows queasy. Leans on the table for support.
PHIPPS
Are you okay?

SELENA
I'm sorry... I think I'm going to
be sick.
Brandt opens a door to a bathroom.
BRANDT
In here.
Selena grabs her pack and rushes in. When the door's
closed, Phipps turns to Dray, indicates monitor.
PHIPPS
Get copies of this freeze frame to
all the undercover people and the
sniper teams.
DRAY
You got it.
PHIPPS
And nobody caps him until we get
that bomb tagged. After that, I
don't give a shit what happens to
him.
Dray goes. There's a long beat.
Brandt looks at the
freeze frame.
BRANDT
He always hid his face. Why's he
giving us a clear picture now?
Beat.
The bathroom TOILET FLUSHES.
Selena emerges.
PHIPPS
Feeling better?
SELENA
I think I'd feel better if I could
rest a little and see my son.
Phipps nods to Brandt, who turns to two of his agents,
one a female.
BRANDT
Escort her.
344

Gordy's on his feet, looking at The Wolf evidence, etc.,
on the walls. He can't keep his eyes off it. It's
reminiscent of what he constructed on his wall at home.
The second Agent's not in the room.

FBI AGENT #1
... Let's go through it again, Mr.
Pitt.
GORDY
I've told you all I know.
FBI AGENT #1
We gotta be sure.
Gordy's eyes go to numbered evidence photo.
It's a
picture of a seashell. He points to it.
GORDY
What's that?
FBI AGENT #1
What's the number on it?
GORDY
Eleven.
The Agent refers to an index sheet as the Second Agent
returns. He's holding a document. To Gordy --
FBI AGENT #2
Mr. Pitt, you said Selena told you
she had a daughter.
GORDY
She was killed in Guatemala.
FBI AGENT #2
According to tests on the blood
we drew on the plane, Selena's
Rhesus F-six. She's genetically
barren. She couldn't possibly
have had kids.
Gordy doesn't understand.
Why would she have lied?
The first Agent finds what he's looking for in the index.
FBI AGENT #1
Number eleven, small seashell with
a hole in it... That was found in
the getaway car used in the
bombing in New York.
OFF Gordy's face...

the back of one hand into the palm of the other.

Gordy bursts in, sees Selena's not there.
GORDY
Where's Selena?!
PHIPPS
She went to see her son.
GORDY
She's lying!
She's The Wolf!
Gordy runs out.
Phipps and others follow.
OFF Brandt...
356
356
Brandt bursts in. He searches. Finds Mauro's leather
doll behind the toilet. The head's detached. Brandt
looks inside, and...
We see a block of reddish Semtex plastic explosive and a
chemical fuse.
BRANDT
Everybody out!
Clear this floor!
Now!

Gordy jumps downstairs, four steps at a time.
358

Institute personnel evacuate offices.

Gordy blows into the second story of the garage, a
converted old-time carriage barn. He's in the old
hayloft. On the opposite side of the loft, a double
door built for loading in hay is open above the street.
Gordy sprints for the opening, and...
373
386
Selena blasts into the bottom floor, runs through a
playroom. Gordy's right behind her.
387
SELENA
387
mounts a stairwell. A girl's descending. Selena grabs a
pigtail and flings her down the stairs, and...
388
GORDY
388
gets there just in time to keep the screaming girl from
falling all the way to the bottom. He sits the uninjured
girl down and continues on.
389
SELENA
389
runs toward the living room, which is undergoing a
renovation. Without stopping, she tears through the
plastic covering the doorway to seal in dust from the
rest of the house. She topples what she can into
Gordy's way. Throws nails down behind her. Grabs a
circular saw and hurls it back at Gordy, just missing him
and shattering a large wall mirror.
Selena's a soldier, taught to pick up and use whatever
weapons she finds as she moves through a battlefield --
this battlefield gives her a crowbar, which she keeps as
she runs out through plastic covering the other doorway.

ARCHWAY

leads into the dining room. Selena runs in. Gordy's
right on her heels. Selena pulls down dining room chairs
in front of Gordy. He vaults one but trips over the
second and falls.
391
SELENA
391
blows through a swinging door into the kitchen, slamming
into a Hispanic maid, who's coming to investigate all
the noise. Both women tumble. Selena gets right back
on her feet. She breaks out a window with the crowbar
and exits onto a fire escape as Gordy blasts in from the
dining room.

enters the first bedroom behind her.
397
WOMAN
397
IN GARDENING CLOTHES and holding a digging tool stands on
a stairwell landing, alarmed and confused by the chaos
she hears in her house. She had started down the stairs
but now has turned back at the sound of the WINDOW
BREAKING on the top floor. Calls.
WOMAN IN GARDENING CLOTHES
What's going on?
127.
398
SELENA

runs into the hallway at the top of the stairs, above the
woman.
WOMAN IN GARDENING CLOTHES
Who are you?
What are you doing
in here?

SELENA

sees an open rooftop door at the top of a flight of
stairs and charges upward without answering.

three deep scratches in his face. Gordy doesn't stop.

Gordy cranks away on the repaired ice cream maker. He's
wearing civvies. He stops cranking, spoons out a huge
dollop into a bowl.

Gordy hands the bowl to Mauro, who's playing in the front
seat of the pumper. Mauro tastes it. Thumbs up. Gordy
smiles.
Mike and the other men on Gordy's old shift are watching.
To Gordy --
MIKE
It'll be good to get you back.
Gordy turns to them. Looks into the faces of these men,
the people closest to him in the world. Beat. Then --
GORDY
It's good to be home.
Gordy's still in pain, still missing the wife and son
he'll never see again. But Gordy's gonna be alright.
Mauro's gonna be with him. There'll be fires to put out
and lives to save and basketball games and the multitude
of miseries and joys the firefighters in Spanish Harlem
see each and every day.
As we PULL BACK, OUT and AWAY from the old brick edifice
from which the big red truck will come, bringing help...
FADE OUT.
