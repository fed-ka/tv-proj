MEDIUM SHOT
Someone pacing outside the mansion gates.
ANGLE) - DAY - CLOSE SHOT
A guard dog pacing inside the gates.
82. MED. FULL SHOT
A most beautiful, romantic spot. Rose
trees in blossom, a vine-covered pergola,
a splashing fountain, a few choice marble
statues, low, deep chairs placed to
make a gorgeous spot. Stew and Anne
enter from the direction of the house.
The garden is dark except for the lights
from the interior of the house. From
within, comes the voice of the singer
rendering an extremely romantic, sentimental
Italian love song. This will continue
to the FADE OUT of the scene.
Stew and Anne walk, still hand in hand,
toward the edge of the pergola where
the shadows are deeper and where a couple
of glorified steamer chairs are placed.
There is a full moon overhead.
She leads him toward a waterfall effect,
a glass partition down which water trickles.
They go behind the dimly lit fountain
and sit
? 33 ?
in a low, deep divan. We see them in
silhouette as they go into a passionate
embrace. All we hear is the faint voice
of Martiniand the uninterrupted splashing
of the fountain.
CUT TO:
83. CLOSEUP - ANNE & STEW
On divan, arms around each other.
STEW
Anne, pinch me, will you? Throw me out
of here. Give me the air. Throw me out
of this joint, will you?
Anne smiles happily and pinches his
nose.
ANNE
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we,
darling?
STEW
Throw me out - because I'm beginning
to get goofy ideas, and they concern
you, Anne.
ANNE
(passionately)
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew,
if they concern me.
STEW
(struggling)
My name is Smith - well, that you seem
to have been able to stand for the last
month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one.
I've never been in jail - that is, not
often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon.
I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like
black coffee and I hate garters. I make
seventy-five bucks a week and I've got
eight hundred and forty-seven bucks
in the bank - and - I don't know yet
whether your eyes are blue or violet.
ANNE
(although he is very close to her)
That's because you're too far away,
Stew.
Throughout his speech, Anne never takes
her eyes off him. As he fumbles now,
he turns. Their eyes meet. His overwhelming
desire for Anne overcomes him.
He dismisses as futile his effort to
be practical, sweeps her into his arms
and kisses her passionately.

143. LONG SHOT OF ESTATE
DISSOLVE INTO:
Two footmen stand at either side of
a huge iron gate. Cars and limousines
are arriving, dropping off guests in
evening wear.
159. CLOSE SHOT
Gallagher has just reached the ballroom
when Stew catches up to her.
? 65 ?
STEW
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am
sorry.
GALLAGHER
(reassuringly)
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it.
As far as she's concerned, I'm just
part of the hired help.
STEW
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne
act that way before. (pause) It's funny
I never thought to tell her you were
a girl, isn't it?
GALLAGHER
Yes.
213. MEDIUM SHOT
Stew and Gallagher appear, coming through
the iron gates.
214. MEDIUM MOVING SHOT
As Stew and Gallagher move off down
the street, a ragged old panhandler
comes wheedling up to them.
PANHANDLER
Pardon me, could you spare a dime for
a cup of coffee?
Stew is struck by a sudden idea as he
regards the bum intently.
STEW
Coffee? How would you like to be a Knight
of the Garter?
PANHANDLER
(stupidly)
Huh! No
Stew raises one foot, then the other,
and quickly removes the solid gold garters
which he presses into the bum's surprised
hand.
STEW
(as he removes the garters)
Just a minute.
(to Gallagher)
Entertain the gentleman, Gallagher.
(to the panhandler)
There you are, my man - with those you
can eat for a couple of months.
He walks away, leaving the bum staring
dazedly at the luxurious pair of garters.
PANHANDLER
(an afterthought)
How about the socks?
215. MED. CLOSE SHOT
As Stew and Gallagher pass the Camera
and go down the street, arm in arm.
As they get past the Camera, Stew is
seen to square his shoulders and throw
out his chest. He shakes first one leg,
and then the other, as if he were throwing
off shackles.
216. CLOSER MOVING SHOT
Stew and Gallagher moving along. Gallagher
has a peculiar expression as she glances
at Stew. She has been deeply affected
by the scene she has just witnessed.
Stew's face is very thoughtful.
GALLAGHER
(comfortingly)
I wouldn't worry too much about it,
Stew. She'll see it your way.
? 92 ?
STEW
Huh?
(snapping out of it)
Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm
worrying about that second act curtain,
that's all.
Gallagher stares at him, realizing he
is thinking more about the play than
his split-up with his wife. Then she
breaks into a grin.
GALLAGHER
Why, you're just a first-class chump!
You just staged a scene that would play
like a million dollars! How about that
declaration of independence for the
second act curtain?
Stew stops stock still and stares at
her.
STEW
(almost reverently)
That's an idea, Gallagher - a great
idea.
Gallagher happily links her arm in his
and again they move down the street.
