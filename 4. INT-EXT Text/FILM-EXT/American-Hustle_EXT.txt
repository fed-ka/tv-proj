Young Irving and his Father and Mother standing outside the
family's glass repair shop in the Bronx as some tough
contractors march up to them.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
I would rather be on the taking
side than the getting taken side
any day of the week, especially
after I saw how my father got
taken. I mean, seeing that scarred
me for life.
Young Irving runs by a store front as he throws a rock
through each window on the store, smashing them all.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I took it upon myself to drum up
business. I became a different kind
of guy than my father. I became a
con artist -- from the feet up, for
real.
CUT TO:
THE BRONX: STOREFRONT WITH SMASHED WINDOW. - DAY - PRESENT
Irv shakes his head, surveys the damage.

IRVING ROSENFELD
I was gonna survive no matter what.
I still had the glass business and
a few dry cleaning stores on the
side.

Chicago's "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?" fades
up. Jamming early 70s HOLIDAY party -- LONG ISLAND LADIES IN
BIKINIS WITH HUGE HAIR IN FUR COATS SMOKING OUTSIDE THE GLASS
ENCLOSED POOL -while inside steamed glass SHINY BIKINI
CANDIDATES FOR NOSE JOBS; A FEW OTHERS WHO ARE LARGE, SEVERAL
GUYS WHO LOOK MOBBED UP, pale, out of shape, gold chains, in
swim trunks, EVEN MORE BURT REYNOLDS TYPE GUYS, slim, hairy,
chains.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
So, one January I go to my friends
pool party in Long Island.
Irving sits holding court with some friends by the pool when
he turns and sees Sydney for the first time.
PUSH IN ON: Irving. He looks up, they lock eyes across the
party.
SYD REACHES FOR A SLICE OF FRUIT ON HIGH SET PLATE WHEN
IRVING'S HAND GRABS HER ARM -- she turns, taken aback -
IRVING ROSENFELD
Is that Duke Ellington on your
bracelet?
She does have on a Duke Ellington charm bracelet.
SYDNEY PROSSER
As a matter of fact, it is. He died
this year, you know.
10.
IRVING ROSENFELD
I know. I doubt anyone else here
knows or cares about it.
SYDNEY PROSSER
Well I care. He saved my life many
times.
Irving takes a good look at her, impressed.
IRVING ROSENFELD
(impressed)
Mine too. Which one?
SYDNEY PROSSER
Jeep's Blues.
IRVING ROSENFELD
(smiles, warm)
Jeep's Blues. Oh yeah.
Awkward pause.
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
You wanna hear it?
SYDNEY PROSSER
Right now?
IRVING ROSENFELD
Yeah.
SYDNEY PROSSER
Sure.
CUT TO: PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER PLAYS START OF JEEP'S BLUES as
Irving and Sydney nod to it - he watches her foot in her high
wedge and her tanned leg rocking as she sits on arm of sofa.
IRVING ROSENFELD
Who starts a song like that?!
SYDNEY PROSSER
It's magic.
IRVING ROSENFELD
Magic.
They listen to the record, Edith checks Irving out.
11.
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
He wasn't necessarily in good
shape, and he had this comb-over
that was rather -- elaborate. He
had this air about him. And he had
this confidence that drew me to
him. He was who he was and he
didn't care.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
Like me, she was a very particular
person. Like me, she came from a
place where her options were
limited -- and she had been someone
she didn't want to be in her past.
CUT TO -- SYDNEY DANCES IN A SMALL TOWN, OLD FASHIONED STRIP
BAR.
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
It actually can feel kind of sexy
sometimes. There's a boldness in
it. But where would that boldness
take me? I didn't know. But I was
gonna find out.

SYDNEY WALKS DOWN A BLEAK INDUSTRIAL STREET.
CUT TO -- RECORD STORE WHERE EDITH FLIPS THROUGH ALBUMS OF
THE OLD GREATS -- ELLA FITZGERALD, DUKE ELLINGTON, AND MORE
OF THE OLD GREATS -- A WORLD OF ELEGANCE, SOPHISTICATION, AND
CULTURE A MILLION MILES AWAY FROM WHERE SHE LIVES.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
Like me, she learned to survive and
reinvent herself. She knew she had
to reinvent her life and her
identity. And like me, she
envisioned a better elegant future
for herself. Like me, she knew you
had to have a vision.
Sydney looks at scrap of paper with info in her hand -- looks
up at office building address -- enters.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
She came to New York. She
envisioned it.
(MORE)
12.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And just like that, she applied for
a job at Cosmopolitan Magazine.

Irv and Sydney dance slowly.
SYDNEY
PROSSER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

anything, was to

was.

Irv holds the door open for Edith as she enters.
IRVING ROSENFELD
-- I got two in the Bronx and three
in Manhattan. (to an employee) Hey,
Byron.
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
He had a chain of dry cleaning
stores. He asked me to come in and
upgrade my wardrobe-- he said a lot
of nice things got left behind by
people and forgotten over the years-
-
IRVING ROSENFELD
I mean you wouldn't believe the
shit that people leave behind here.
Unbelievable.
SYDNEY PROSSER
People leave stuff here?
IRVING ROSENFELD
Oh yeah. They go out for the night,
they drink, come here in the
morning, put their clothes in and
then they forget. They got no idea
where they left it.
Irving touches a hanging blue sequined dress.
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
Look at that. Sequined thing. I
don't know. Is that nice or not?
14.
SYDNEY PROSSER
It's beautiful.
Irving and Sydney continue to walk through towards the back
and enter a fur vault filled with elegant designer clothes.
IRVING ROSENFELD
I mean, some of it's been here for
years. They're not picking it up.
Nobody's picking it up.
Sydney starts riffling through nice things hanging on the
racks.
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
You like that?
SYDNEY PROSSER
I love it.
IRVING ROSENFELD
It's yours. You want it? It's
yours.
Sydney looks back at Irving in shock.
CUT TO: SHE STEPS OUT OF THE DRESSING ROOM IN THE VON
FURSTENBERG DRESS - LOOKS FANTASTIC.
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
You look fantastic!
SYDNEY PROSSER
Oh my god. I can only dream about
these dresses. They're beautiful.
SYDNEY PULLS CLASSIC CLOTHES FROM THE ABANDONED RACK: ONE,
TWO, THREE. SHE PUTS A JACKET ON HIM THAT HE IS RELUCTANT TO
WEAR, PAISLEY SMOKING COAT.
LATER: THEY GO INSIDE THE ELECTRIC ROTATING CAROUSEL RACK OF
CLEAR PLASTIC COVERED, DRY CLEANED CLOTHES -- STAND INSIDE,
ENCHANTED, SMILING AT EACH OTHER, AS THE RACK SWIRLS
MAGICALLY AROUND THEM. THEY STARE AT EACH IN LOVE.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
I felt like we had a secret. Just
the two of us. You know like that
thing where you want to just be
with the one person the whole time.
15.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
You feel like the two of you
understand something that nobody
else gets. I could just tell her
everything about myself. And I
never had anybody like that in my
life before. I felt like finally, I
can truly be myself without being
ashamed, without being embarrassed.

ONE OF SYDNEY'S NANNY FRIENDS, REBECCA, walk out of a
BUSINESS MAN's (34) house pushing a stroller as the business
man comes chasing after them.
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
And so Irving and I began our
partnership -- in love and
commerce.
BUSINESSMAN
Rebecca, hold on. You're Edith
right?
SYDNEY PROSSER(V.O.)
He told me to tell my friends I had
(in British accent) London banking
connections
BUSINESSMAN
I'm Jim. I'm her employer. Listen -
- she told me you can get me a line
of credit. I know you have banking
connections in London, England.
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
And after that...say "no" a lot
until the guy is hooked.
Edith and Rebecca start walking away as the businessman
chases after them.
19.
BUSINESSMAN
Becky tell her! I've never missed a
check!
EDITH GREENSLY

NO!
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)

and pulls into his driveway of his split-level ranch. Irv

gets out of his Cadillac and walks to the front door of his
house --
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
We talk ourselves into things. We
sell ourselves things we maybe
don't even need or want by dressing
them up. We leave out the risk. We
leave out the ugly truth.
57
Irving, Edith, Richie, and the fake Sheik admire a REMBRANDT
painting on the wall.
IRVING ROSENFELD
I want to show you something. This
Rembrandt here? People come from
all over the world to see this.
RICHIE DIMASO
Yeah, he's good.
IRVING ROSENFELD
It's a fake.
RICHIE DIMASO
Wait, what're you talking about?
That's impossible.
IRVING ROSENFELD
People believe what they want to
believe. Cause the guy who made
this was so good that it's real to
everybody. Now whose the master --
the painter or the forger?
Richie's continues to stare at the REMBRANDT on the wall.
RICHIE DIMASO
That's a fake?
IRVING ROSENFELD
That's the way the world works. Not
black and white as you say.
Extremely grey.
ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE walks up to Irving and the group and
steps into the conversation.
ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE
Irving can I --
IRVING ROSENFELD
How many times I gotta tell you.
You can't meet the sheik, alright?
Edith sees this and steps into the conversation.
EDITH GREENSLY
Arthur? Hi. Edith. We've met
before.
42.
EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D)
I wanted to introduce you to Robert
Spencer. We're advising the Sheik

IRVING ROSENFELD
Mr. Mayor -- Please stop. Listen, I
apologize if that prick offended
you. I really apologize.
Carmine will not turn around -- Irving catches up.
CARMINE POLITO
Really, I'm all right, thank you.
I'm okay.
IRVING ROSENFELD
No. I'm fucking embarrassed to be
associated with that guy at all.
Can I just say somethin' to you,
please? Don't lose this opportunity
to fuckin' Florida -- all right? --
because of some bullshit from that
punk advisor with his diploma who
could never get into the school
that we come from. Don't lose that
opportunity.
56.
CARMINE POLITO
Where you from?
IRVING ROSENFELD
I'm from the Bronx. Grand
Concourse, Hundred and Sixty-fourth
Street.
THIS REACHES CARMINE. HE AND IRV ARE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH.
CARMINE POLITO
I got a lot of friends that live up
there. I go to Tomaso's on Arthur
Avenue. You know Tomasos's?
IRVING ROSENFELD
Yeah, Tomaso's.
CARMINE POLITO
The spicy clams.
IRVING ROSENFELD
Yes. They're always good.
CARMINE POLITO
Oh, they're to fucking die for,
those clams. I haven't been there
in a while. I like that place.
IRVING ROSENFELD
Carmine -- can I call you Carmine?
You know, Carmine -- (catches his
breath) My fuckin' heart's going
from running down the stairs -- I'm
not used to running. There's a
lotta green grass in that hotel
room up there, alright? And all the
deals would float through you. You
get a serious piece on both ends.
You do with that what you will. I
live in the real world, I am a
family man, I got mouths to feed
and everything. But, you know, we
just...we gotta grease you
directly. No middlemen, no
bullshit. It's the Arab way.
CARMINE POLITO
Yeah, look, I understand. It's a
great opportunity. It's just I got
a little thrown by going to have a
meeting with somebody who ended up
not being there, so --
57.
IRVING ROSENFELD
Hey, listen, I was thrown as well.
CARMINE POLITO
I understand. I'll deal with you
directly. I don't want any
middleman or any of that bullshit.
IRVING ROSENFELD
Done.
CARMINE POLITO
I like you. Eye to eye. We can do
business together.
Irv smiles and nods as they walk back into the hotel
together.
CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
How long do you know this guy? You
work with this guy before?
IRVING ROSENFELD
I gotta work with him. He's the
Sheik's man.

okay?
IRVING ROSENFELD
Done.

Todd Rundgren's "I Saw the Light" plays somewhere. Edith
dressed in tight Halston dress, hair flows huge all round
her; walks with Richie, who is waiting in a white gray suit
with a white disco collar outside the lapel, chains around
his neck.
EDITH GREENSLY
Didn't your fiance want to come out
tonight?
RICHIE DIMASO
Yeah, no, I don't know.
EDITH GREENSLY
I'm sorry, we don't have to talk
about it. I was just teasing you.
RICHIE DIMASO
Do you ever think, how did I end up
here? How did my life become this?
You ever think that? And you
wonder, am I ever gonna get to a
better place or is this it? You
ever feel like that?
Edith stares, nods yes.
EDITH GREENSLY
I do. I definitely know that.
Edith nods puts a hand on his face.
EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry we don't have to go
dancing. We can go have coffee or
talk or something.
RICHIE DIMASO
No, I need this. Please, I need to
go dancing with you.
Richie reaches down and squeezes her hand.
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
Please.

Edith smiles.

EDITH GREENSLY
OK baby, let's go dancing.

They walk in the morning sun to Carmine's Lincoln where he
opens the trunk and they stare at what is inside.
IRVING ROSENFELD
What is it?
71.
CARMINE POLITO
It's a microwave. It heats up
everything. Pasta, lasagna,
meatballs, whatever.
IRVING ROSENFELD
Really?
CARMINE POLITO
It's science, yeah. That's how it
heats up the food. It's scientific.
IRVING ROSENFELD
And you specifically bought this
science oven for me.
CARMINE POLITO
(Carmine stares
meaningfully at Irv)
Yes. A new friend.
Irv is touched. He sees it is a sincere gift from Carmine,
because Carmine likes him; not cynical in any way.
IRVING ROSENFELD
Thank you.
CARMINE POLITO
Don't put metal in it. Come on,
let's get out of here.

Don't look at me. Don't look at my
legs, don't look at my hair, don't
smell my hair, don't ask me how I
am, don't talk to me outside of
these roles, 'cause we're done.
IRVING ROSENFELD
What are you doing? Get under the
umbrella. It's just that Carmine
wants Rosalyn to come.
EDITH GREENSLY
I don't care. You weren't
listening. I don't care if Rosalyn
comes. Just do your job, okay?
You're nothing to me until you're
everything. I'm not Rosalyn. I'm
not gonna put up with that shit.
THEY ARRIVE AT Richie as the JET arrives on the tarmac.
RICHIE DIMASO
Now that's a fucking jet right?
76.
IRVING ROSENFELD
It's good.
RICHIE DIMASO
That's the kinda moves you need to
make.
They walk towards the Jet and walk on leaving Carmine and
Edith waiting outside.

ELO's "10538 Overture" kicks on. Irv and Richie exit the
plane walking slightly behind the "sheik" and his
"bodyguards" - the sheik in the front.
The Sheik hands the ceremonial knife to Carmine and bows his
head --
CARMINE POLITO
Hello Sheik, my friend. Welcome.
On behalf of the great state of New
Jersey I want to welcome you to New
Jersey. I know that was redundant.
I'm sorry. I'm just very nervous.

Elton John continues as Carmine LIGHTS A CIGARETTE in a two-

JULIUS, CARMINE, TITO, MELORA (Carmine's STEADFAST AIDES)
son DOMINIC, daughter LUCILLE, wife Dolly, assorted COPS,
FIREMEN IN FORMAL UNIFORMS WHITE GLOVES, UNION GUYS in suits,

Irv tries to turn Rosalyn away, but she keeps turning back

OPPOSITE PROSECUTOR, AMADO
- - the tape recorder and
microphone sit on the desk
in front of Stoddard as he records
a statement for a report.
STODDARD THORSEN
(SLOW MIDWEST MONOTONE)
Agent Dimaso called me late at
night on the 21st. I believe that
he was intoxicated. He threatened
me and I told him this was
inappropriate. I told him
procedures exist for reasons we
must respect. This is the third
such call I received from Agent
Dimaso. He called me again the
night of the 5th and he threatened
to kill me. Subsequently he
demanded that I allow him to use
the Sherman Suite at the Plaza
hotel for purposes of bribing
members of congress.
Camera pull-back reveals: THE CHASTENED Richie SITS
LISTENING, IN A SUIT AND TIE. He's in trouble with their
boss, the prosecutor.
RICHIE DIMASO
I am so sorry.
STODDARD THORSEN
I'm not finished. There's a lot
more.
Richie gets up and pulls up a chair next to Stoddard.
Stoddard flinches and moves away like he's going to get hit
again.

RICHIE DIMASO
I have nothing but the utmost
respect for you as my mentor. (he
reaches down and turns the tape
recorder off) and as my --
STODDARD THORSEN
(re: the recorder)
What are you doing?
RICHIE DIMASO
I just want to talk from my heart.
I don't want it on record. I want
to get vulnerable.
STODDARD THORSEN
Can I finish? Can I finish my
statement?
RICHIE DIMASO
Of course. I respect you.
STODDARD THORSEN
I think you do other things besides
respect me.

Representative O'Connell was
contacted by Carmine Polito to ask
if he could obtain rapid

CLOSE UP: ROSALYN STARES INTO LENS. Emotional, a mixture of
sadness and hope. She holds a closed bottle of her favorite
nail finish and smells it nostalgically.

Irving's Caddy comes screeching up to the house and parks in

They LAUGH, Irving's hair is all messed up.
Pete patches out. Irving and Carmine are a mess, shirts
ripped open, no buttons, they look at each other VERY SHAKEN.
CARMINE POLITO
Is it true? Is it true what he
said about your wife?
IRVING ROSENFELD
It's not fucking true. That's not
true.

The spare rhythmic intro of Jeff Lynne's "Long Black Road"
plays as Richie looks back over his shoulder and walks
towards the building with intensity.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
Necessity truly is the mother of
invention. The F.B.I. was willing
to wire the two million dollars if
it meant taking down Tellegio and
his entire organization.
178A
Irving walks with Richie and Sydney up to an office building.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

SYDNEY PROSSER

RUNS TO HIM IN HER HIGH HEELS -- HELPS HIM SIT UP ON THE
SIDEWALK.
SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)
Your heart pills. Where are your
heart pills?
She digs through his pockets, finds the pills, and feeds one
to him.
Sydney struggles to help Irving to his feet and together, an
embattled but surviving couple, they cross the street arm and
arm. She opens the door and helps him into the car.
IRVING ROSENFELD
I've got to lay down.
145.
SYDNEY PROSSER
Just rest.
She gets in and closes the door.

Camera tilts down from the Federal Building to find Richie
coming down the stairs, emotional. Richie walks wiping his
eyes, his innocence and Edith, lost.

GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT WITH A BAG FULL OF GROCERIES.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

GREY HAIRED SENATOR HORTON MITCHELL, wife by his side, denies
any wrongdoing and is photographed and humiliated as he then
sits with her in a Federal car.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
But in all it was six Congressmen,
one United States Senator, and my
friend, Carmine Polito.
THE DOOR TO CARMINE'S CLAPBOARD HOUSE OPENS, CARMINE STANDS
IN THE DOOR, STARES AT THE AGENTS, HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN IN
TEARS STAND BEHIND HIM AS HE SERVED A WARRANT. CARMINE IS
HANDCUFFED.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
We gave the two million back so
Carmine got the reduced sentence.
18 months. The loss of his
friendship would haunt me for the
rest of my life.

Irving stares at Rosalyn.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
She would always be interesting.
Rosalyn gets in to a car, revealing Pete Musane in the
driver's seat. Irving leans in.
PETE MUSANE
(to Irving)
You know my boss knows you did him
a solid.
IRVING ROSENFELD
Yes I did. He never took a nickle
so they can't get him for nothing.
I was never going to let that
happen.
Irving starts to leave --
ROSALYN ROSENFELD
Irv.
He stops and looks at her. With red lacquered nails Rosalyn
places her favorite nail finish in his hand.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
I'm done with this nail finish. Bye
for now. I'll see you next weekend.
Irving nods. Rosalyn drives off with Pete.
Sydney stands with Danny.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
Our conning days were behind us.
Irving and Sydney walk hand and hand with Danny down the
street. Irv drops the nail finish into a trashcan.
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
You can fool yourself for just so
long and then your next reinvention
better have your damn feet on the
ground.
