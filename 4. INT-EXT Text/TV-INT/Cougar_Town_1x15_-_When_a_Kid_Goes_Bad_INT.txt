                    Okay, it s not Valentine s Day yet 
                    but please let that bag be my present 
                    because it is soaked with grease.  
                    I ll tell you right now, I don t care 
                    what s in there, I m going to eat it.

                    If it s deep fried, I m still in.
                      (she looks in)
                    You got my favorite fried chicken.  
                    Travis, why?  Are you on drugs?  Is 
                    someone pregnant?  
                      (takes a bite, moans)
                    Ohhh, you know what, it doesn t 
                    matter.  We ll get through it.

                    When they open a new Chicken Shack, 
                    the first fifty people in line get 
                    free food for a month.  So, after 
                    twenty hours standing behind a large 
                    gentleman who used a paint bucket as 
                    both a chair and a commode, you re

                    Shoot, I forgot to call his school, 
                    didn t I?

                    Wow, you are still not great at 
                    zoning in on why I m angry.

                    So he misses one day -- it s his 
                    senior year.  My senior year I 
                    missed, like, fifty days, and...

                              JULES
                    You don t have a nice ending to that

                              BOBBY
                    I don t.  But in my defense, I just 
                    ate a gallon-jug of free coleslaw and 
                    my brain s a little mayonnaise-y.  

                              JULES
                    I only had one piece of chicken, but 
                    I ate the fried skin off ten other 
                    pieces.  I felt my heart skipping 
                    beats, but it s no biggie.  I took a 
                    baby aspirin and Travis knows CPR.
                    Look... you always talk to me about 
                    anything with Travis.  It s how I 
                    stop most of these ideas.  Why didn t 
                    you call? 

                              BOBBY
                    J-Bird, last week we had sex, I asked 
                    you about getting back together, and 
                    you said you weren t interested.  
                    Give me twenty four more hours before 
                    I start calling you to chat.  

                              JULES
                    I get that you re uncomfortable, but 
                    we still have to do all our parenting 
                    together.  When it comes to Travis, 
                    we have to stay a team, okay? 

                              BOBBY
                    Okay, but I get to pick the mascot.  
                    Coleslaw.  Hang on, let me try again.

                    I don t know, but she ll be back

                    I have seen those and they are worth

                    I love your smooth breasts.

                    they think, then he s a giant wuss 
                    and not worth your time anyway.

                              SMITH
                    Jules, it s nice to meet you.  You re 
                    even prettier than Laurie said.

                                LAURIE
                    Smith is such a charmer.  And even 
                    though he s dressed like an 
                      accountant, check out his socks.
                      (lifting his pants leg)
                    Bam!  These say he s still ready to 
                    get wild.

                              JULES
                    So far so good.  But Laurie s one of 
                    my best friends, so before I give you 
                    my blessing, I have a few questions.
                      (quickly)
                    Have you ever cheated on a woman?  
                    Have you ever robbed a bank?  What do 
                    you think of lady firefighers?

                              SMITH
                    No, no, and what they lack in 
                    physical strength they make up for in 
                    empathy and complex problem solving.

                              JULES
                    Almost flawless.  But people have 
                    flaws, and when they seem too perfect 
                    it means they re hiding something 
                    that will rear its ugly head later, 
                    like that birth control pill that 
                    lets you have four periods a year but 
                    also gives you gall stones.

                    This last Christmas my Dad gave our 
                    house keeper, the woman who raised 
                    me, an English Spanish dictionary... 
                    again.  For that and many other 
                    reasons I hate him.  Also I don t 
                    like sharing food.

                    Jules, actually, I don t celebrate 
                      Valentine s Day on principle.  It s a 
                    fake holiday designed to sell cut-
                    rate candy and cuddly teddy bears.

                    Bears are incredibly dangerous

                    flowers, no bear talk.  I promise.

                    I guess hanging out would be okay.

                    No problem.  One bit of advice:  
                    maybe go with a tad less cleavage.  I 
                    can kind of see a tattoo down there.

  Bobby and Jules are both heated as they argue. 

                              JULES
                    Yes, I decided that our underage son 
                    can t drink.  But to be fair, I 
                    didn t make that rule.  America did.

                              BOBBY
                    America also says he s old enough to 
                    act in a porno or fight in Iraq.  

                              JULES
                    Fine, if Travis is starring in a 
                    porno while fighting in Iraq, he can 
                    have a beer.

                              BOBBY
                    Actually, he can t.  Iraq s a Muslim

                    wear those long wrappy things.  You 
                    got to focus on, like, one ankle and 
                    use a lot of imagination.  

                              JULES
                    Not sure how we got there, but the 
                    bottom line is, underage drinking is 
                    dangerous and I won t allow Travis to 
                    go to parties where there s alcohol.  Cougar Town      "When a Kid Goes Bad" [115]           17.

                              BOBBY
                    So he can only go to nerd parties?   
                    Jules, all you re doing is creating a 
                    situation where Travis will be so 
                    afraid to get caught he won t call 
                    for a ride home if he s been 
                    drinking.

                              JULES
                    Travis won t be calling for a ride 
                    because he won t be at the party in 
                    the first place.  We need to stand 
                    strong.  That s our united front.   

                              BOBBY
                    Our  united front  was only decided 
                    by you.  You never asked me how to 
                    deal with this.  I had a great idea.

                              JULES
                    Maybe because your last  great idea  
                    was the  go-anywhere computer .

                    Don t say it was just like a laptop, 
                    because mine was bigger.  Anyway, 
                    this idea is way better than that.

                    Look, your Mom doesn t want you 
                    drinking.  I get it.  It s illegal.  
                    But I know that you re a teenager, 
                    and you re going to drink no matter 
                    what because alcohol is delicious and 
                    makes everything better. 

                                TRAVIS
                    I can t tell if this speech is 
                      responsible or insane. 

                              BOBBY
                    Here s the deal:  If you re ever 
                    somewhere drinking and you need a 
                    ride home, you call me.  No matter 
                    what time it is I ll pick you up, no 
                    questions asked.  And if I ve been 
                    drinking, which is likely, we ll call 
                    my buddy Two-Tone.  He s a Mormon.
                      (then)
                    There s just one rule:  Your Mom can 
                    never know about our deal.  Cool?

                                TRAVIS
                    Totally cool.

                    You re talking about jazz sharks?  
                    Are those sharks that play music?  
                    How does that even work?

                                TRAVIS
                    I don t know.  That s why it s an 
                      interesting discussion. 

                              JULES
                    I guess that s cool.

                                      ACT THREE


  Jules, Laurie and Ellie are there.  Travis comes downstairs. 

                              JULES
                    Happy Valentine s Day, Trav!  FYI, 
                    you didn t have to buy me a gift.  
                    The best gift you ever gave me was a 
                    kiss on the lips when you were five. 

                                TRAVIS
                    That is so not happening.

                              JULES
                      (as Travis exits, calling out)
                    Don t be sure!  I still have a kiss 
                    coupon from when you were little!

  She goes to the drawer and starts digging around.

                                LAURIE
                    I gave my Mom a  kiss  coupon when I 
                    was little.  She re-gifted it to her 
                      boyfriend.  From what I could hear, 
                    she gave him an upgrade.

                              ELLIE
                    Your stories are never surprising. 
                      (then, to Jules)
                    Looks like Travis is still mad at you 
                    for saying no to the party.

                              JULES
                    Yeah.  I just worry about him being 
                    safe... but I guess you always worry 
                    about your kids.  When they re babies 
                    you re afraid they ll hit their soft 
                    spot and go brain dead or stick their 
                    tongue in an outlet and get 
                      electrified.  Then they get a little 
                    older and you worry they ll go blind 
                    looking at an eclipse or fall out of 
                    a tree and impale their head on a 
                    gate.  Then they hit the teen years 
                    and it s sex, drugs, guns, booze, car 
                    racing, boat racing, weird choking 
                    fetishes, shingles... Basically from 
                    the time they cut that bloody cord, 
                    your whole life is about keeping your 
                    kid alive.  Cougar Town      "When a Kid Goes Bad" [115]           22.

                    No wonder you don t like horror 
                    movies.  They can t top the one 
                    playing in your head all the time.

                                LAURIE
                    Is choking really a fetish if you re 
                    just kinda into it? 

                              ELLIE
                    You re right, dear -- that would just 
                    make it a proclivity.    

                              JULES
                    More like an inclination.  You have 
                    an inclination for choking, Laurie.

  The lights are all off.  Travis quietly sneaks in the back.  
  Suddenly the lights flip on.  Jules sits on a counter stool.

                              JULES
                    I was married to your Dad for twenty

                    Got it.  See you in the morning.

  Travis goes in to kiss Jules on the cheek, she sniffs.

  From outside we hear Bobby doing trash raccoons.

  Roger reviews the papers with a still-troubled Andy.

                              ROGER
                    Closing this will be a nice 
                      Valentine s Day gift for your wife.

                              ANDY
                    Yep... she loves me and money.  Not 
                    in that order.

  A beat as Andy thinks about what he s about to do.  Then:

                              ANDY
                    Hey, I need to clear something up.  I 
                    said some really mean things about 
                    the girl your son is dating, and they 
                    weren t true.  I just did it to 
                    impress you.  Laurie s actually a 
                    great girl with a big heart. 

                              ROGER
                    I m waiting for the punch line.

                              ANDY
                    No punch line.  I like Laurie.  And 
                    you should be happy your son is with 
                    her.  And if standing up for a friend 
                    is contrary to your business strategy 
                    then I don t need your business.
                      (beat, then off Roger)
                    You re not giving me your business 
                    are you?  That s fine.  But if you ll 
                    excuse me, I have to go tell my wife 
                    her dream convertible will remain at 
                    a police auction lot in Toledo.

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Travis and Bobby are there, speaking quietly.

                                TRAVIS
                    Sorry, Dad.  Mom s going to hose you.

                              BOBBY
                    Don t worry about it.  Our deal still 
                    stands:  Always call if you need me.  

                                TRAVIS
                    Thank you.    Cougar Town      "When a Kid Goes Bad" [115]           29.

                      (entering, angry)
                    Travis, I need to talk to your Dad.  
                      (as Travis exits, angrier)
                    Bobby, I cannot believe--
                      (Travis is gone, happy)
                    We pulled this off.  Your plan was 
                    genius!  We stick with my rule of no 
                    drinking, but if he does, your new 
                    rule of picking him up and secretly 
                    telling me what he did keeps him 
                    alive!  Trav feels like he s got a 
                    confidant in you, plus he ll never 
                    get behind the wheel.  

                              BOBBY
                    I feel like a spy.  But like an evil 
                    spy, because Trav s my kid. 

                              JULES
                    My God, we might actually die before 
                    our son.  That makes me so happy.   

                              BOBBY
                    We make a pretty good team, huh? 

                              JULES
                    We do, Bobby.  Nice job.   
                      (As Travis enters to grab 
                        phone, Jules, angry, to Bobby)
                    You stupid, irresponsible ass!
                      (Travis is gone, fishing)
                    Sorry.  Hey, what are you doing 
                    tonight for Valentine s? 

                              BOBBY
                    Heading back to the boat.  I got a 
                      lady-in-waiting waiting.    

  He kisses her on the head and leaves her, melancholy.

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Jules is in her red Valentine s sweater, drinking wine.  
  Alone.  A knock at the door.  It s Grayson.   

                              GRAYSON
                    Come outside.  I ve got something to 
                    show you.

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:
