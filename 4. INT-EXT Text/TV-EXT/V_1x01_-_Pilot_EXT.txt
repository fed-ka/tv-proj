    A flock of pigeons head skyward as FATHER JACK LOWERY (30)
    opens the doors to the inner-city church for the day.  

    Nothing but junkies and prostitutes outside -- that, and
    one faithful parishioner in a wheelchair, who's always there.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                            2.
    CONTINUED:

                                    FATHER JACK
                  Morning Roy.

                                    ROY
                  Morning Father Jack.

    Just as Jack and ROY (45) head into the otherwise deserted
    church...  There's ANOTHER SMALL TREMOR.  Off Jack pausing...


    CLANK!  A JEWELER (60's) slides an expandable security gate
    to one side as he opens his business for the day.  

    RYAN NICHOLS (36) waits patiently with him as he unlocks
    the front door.  The two step inside, the Jeweler flipping
    the CLOSED sign to OPEN.  

    As the door closes behind them, ANOTHER EERIE RUMBLE rolls
    through the city... The "Open" sign sways back and forth...


    Ryan, ring in hand, sprints toward his car.  

    But suddenly there's a terrible NOISE.  As if something's
    falling at high speed.  He looks back just in time to see...

    ...an F-16 fighter jet drop out of the goddamn sky and crash
    into a building!  

    KABOOM!  Ryan ducks as a massive FIREBALL erupts.  Can't 
    believe it.  What the fuck's happening?!!  He bolts. 


    Ryan rounds a corner, dodging a shower of SPARKS coming
    from a blown transformer.  

    Then, out of nowhere, he's stunned as the pilot of the downed
    jet floats to the ground directly in front of him, dangling
    from his chute.  

    His lifeless and bloodied body gently touches down and
    crumples to the pavement.  

    Ryan rushes to the pilot, checks for a pulse - but the pilot's
    dead.  Ryan stands.  Looks around, terrified.  

    He's surrounded by high-rises that mostly block his view of
    the sky.  But then he catches a glimpse...  

    Reflected in the hundreds of windows lining an office tower
    is the distorted image of something monstrously big.  



                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                            7.
    CONTINUED:

    Ryan's heart nearly stops.  As he stands frozen in fear,
    the RUMBLING BEGINS TO SUBSIDE...


    Chad tears down the street, enters a high rise, having run
    from the hotel.  The shaking CONTINUES TO WEAKEN. 


    Cassie only makes it halfway across the street to Mrs.
    Belker's house before stopping dead in her tracks. 

    Val quickly catches up, negotiating her way through the
    throng of neighbors who've poured onto the road.  

    Everyone stands in silence staring up at something off in
    the distance.  Val's jaw drops as she sees what they see.


    CLOSE ON Tyler's foot as he KICK STARTS his motorcycle. 
    Bryce racing up to him...    

                                    BRYCE
                  Don't go.  They're telling people to
                  stay inside.

    VROOOM!  Tyler ignores him and roars away, off to save his
    mom.  As a panicky Bryce turns and heads back inside, CAMERA
    TILTS to the second floor windows to find...  

    Doctors and patients alike, faces pressed against the glass,
    staring into the distance.  A collective look of horror...                                                                                              9.



    A swarm of office workers all looking skyward.  GASPING. 
    CRYING.  AWESTRUCK.  PUSH IN on Chad as he makes his way
    through the crowd.  No one can believe what they're seeing...


    Both priests race out of the church, followed closely by
    Roy, back in his chair.  They look to the sky.  Father Travis
    drops to his knees praying. Father Jack crosses himself... 


    Ryan stomps on the gas.  His car peels away from the curb. 
    He can't take his eyes off what's in the rear view mirror.  

    As he barrels at us, we CRANE UP HIGH, past the office towers
    and finally reveal what everyone's staring at...

    ...A single, massive spaceship - two miles wide - has come to
    rest, now parked over the majestic skyscrapers of downtown L.A.

                                                                                  TIME CUT:


    CLOSE ON Tyler's sportsbike zooming along the crowded road. 
    OVER PICTURE we hear:

                                      NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                  It's been three hours since they arrived
                  and still no contact with any of the
                  29 ships now hovering over the major
                  cities of the world.  Reports of damage
                  continue to pour in, especially on the
                  west coast, where multiple ships
                  converged before crossing the Pacific...

    Tyler motors up to CAMERA and stops his bike.  Pulls off
    his helmet and looks in awe at THE GLEAMING SHIP. 

    It's enormous.  Stationary.  Hovering only twenty feet above
    the tallest building.  The craft reflecting so brilliantly
    the light of a new day, that he has to shade his eyes...  

    A large military presence has converged on the area.  It's
    like a war zone.  Tyler is suddenly grabbed by A SOLDIER.

                                    TYLER
                  HEY!

                                    SOLDIER
                  This area's restricted.  

    As Tyler's hauled away...

                                    TYLER
                  It's the only way I can get home! 
                  All the streets are blocked!                                                                                            10.



    Groups of civilians are being hustled out of the area by
    armed soldiers.  Abandoned vehicles.  Troops on the move. 

    CAMERA finds an agitated Erica, stopped at a military
    barricade, holding her badge up to an equally agitated
    MARINE.  Mid argument:

                                    ERICA
                  Look again, Sergeant, I'm FBI!

                                    MARINE
                  Counter Terrorism Division, I can
                  read.  You're still not getting
                  through.

                                    ERICA
                  I'm looking for my son.

                                    MARINE
                    Everybody's looking for their son.  

                                    ERICA
                  He called me an hour ago.  Your men
                  are holding him for Evac at 6th and
                  Main.  That's only one block up!

                                    MARINE
                  Turn around.

                                    ERICA
                  I'm a federal agent!  

                                    MARINE
                  And I have my orders!  Turn around!

    He gets distracted by two civilians getting into a fight
    and rushes over to break it up.  Erica puts her jeep in
    gear, stomps on the gas and motors through the barricade.  


    Tyler moves through the crowd, eyes searching.  Finally, he
    spots a limping Erica, looking for him.  

                                    TYLER
                  Mom!

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          13.
    CONTINUED:

    He rushes to her.  Tears well in Erica as she embraces Tyler.   

                                    ERICA
                  You're okay.  Thank God you're okay. 

    An emotional Tyler finds his mom's eyes. 

                                    TYLER
                  I heard you screaming.  Are you
                  alright?  What happened to your leg?

                                    ERICA
                  I'm okay - I'm okay, Ty.  Come on.

    She starts to lead Tyler away, but then...  

    All eyes suddenly turn toward the spacecraft as the ship
    begins to emit a HUM.  The hum quickly ramps to a HIGH
    PITCHED SOUND.  Something's happening to the underbelly.    

    Erica grabs Tyler.  They duck behind a car.  The rest of
    the crowd likewise scrambles to safety.  

    They look on as millions of various sized panels that make
    up the outer metallic skin begin to rotate, pivot and slide...


    The same phenomenon is happening simultaneously on all of
    the ships worldwide.


    Erica and Tyler watch as the rotating panels begin to
    interlock - and like a jigsaw puzzle - form one large smooth
    surface that begins to GLOW BRIGHT WHITE.  

    SCREAMING.  PANIC.  The soldiers aim their weapons.  

    EXTREME CLOSE UP on Tyler's fearful eyes.  The white light
    reflects in his pupils.  It grows brighter and brighter
    until eventually it engulfs everything... WHITE OUT... 

    We hear SCREAMING, CRYING, then... The light BEGINS TO
    SUBSIDE and it quickly becomes apparent: 

    It's not a weapon... it's a screen.

    And a picture is forming.  The crowd falls SILENT.  Tyler
    and Erica look on, hearts pounding, adrenaline pumping. 
    And as the picture finally resolves we reveal...

    ANNA (40), the Visitor Leader.  Her image fills the screen;
    the entire underside of the two mile wide ship.  Breathless:

                                    TYLER
                  My god...

                                                                      HARD CUT TO BLACK:

                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                          14.


                                          ACT TWO

    FADE IN:


    Erica and Tyler stare at the enormous image overhead.  Anna
    smiles, and like a benevolent deity looking down on humanity,
    speaks in a soft tone:

                                    ANNA
                  Don't be frightened.  We mean no
                  harm.  Please accept our apologies. 
                  We're truly anguished by the turmoil
                  our arrival has caused.  It was
                    unintentional, and we're standing by
                  to help in any way we can... 

    Her voice has a strange HARMONIC QUALITY but other than
    that she appears almost human.  


    The same message rings out from every ship simultaneously.

                                    ANNA
                        (in Japanese; subtitled)
                  We admit we watched you for a short
                  time, but only to determine if you
                  were friendly.  We're delighted to
                  meet you... but we need your help.  


                                    ANNA
                        (in Italian; subtitled)
                  We're far from home and require water
                  and a mineral which is common and
                  abundant on Earth in order to sustain
                  ourselves.  


                                    ANNA
                        (in Arabic; subtitled)
                  In exchange we'd be willing to share
                  some of our technological advances
                  with you.                                                                                            15.



                                    ANNA
                        (in Portugese; subtitled)
                  Technology that will help enrich
                  your lives in all areas.  Agriculture,
                  medicine, transportation...  


    Tyler and Erica, bathed in the light of the screen:

                                    ANNA
                  We look forward to getting to know
                  our new friends.  There will be more
                    communication with your world's
                  leaders in the hours to come.  Until
                  then... we are of peace, always.  

    And her image fades away... A moment of stunned SILENCE,
    then, a small smattering of APPLAUSE.  And then more and
    more until it grows into a tidal wave of CHEERS and ADULATION.

                                                                                  FADE OUT:


    A nice two story home in Pasadena.

                                      NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                  Countries around the world are
                  scrambling to schedule meetings with
                  the Visitors after their astounding
                  arrival yesterday morning...


    Speaking of going to see the ship in person... 

    CAMERA finds Father Jack walking through the crowd at the
    outer edges of the military barricades.  

    Most people are there taking pictures, marveling at the sight. 
    But there are a few misguided souls, people on the fringe of
    society, that have made the ship an object of worship.  

    Some kowtow, others seem to be locked in prayer looking up
    at the ship.  They're mostly ignored by the rest of the
    crowd.  But to Father Jack, they stand out like a bad omen... 


    As Anna, the U.N. SECRETARY (60's), and Anna's entourage exit
    the vehicles, heading for the U.N. building, a gaggle of
    reporters rush along side, swarming them as they go.  

    Security scrambles to hold them at bay.  Chaos ensues as
    the reporters - Chad among them - jockey for position in
    the moving procession.  

    Anna is caught off guard.  She expects to be treated with
    reverence, but the press is being pushy.  And because they're
    held back, have to SHOUT their questions.

                                    REPORTER #1
                  Anna, what do you have to say about
                  the damage caused by your arrival?  

                                    ANNA
                  It was unintentional, as stated
                  earlier.  

                                    REPORTER #1
                    Unintentional or not, lives were
                  lost; property destroyed.  

                                    ANNA
                  For which we've apologized.  

                                    REPORTER #2
                  How much of our water are you gonna
                  take?  You said you needed water.  

                                    ANNA
                  We're not taking anything.  We will
                  negotiate for a certain amount to
                  replenish our-- 

                                    REPORTER #3
                  Why park your ships over our cities -
                  it feels like a threat.  

                                    ANNA
                  There's no threat, it's so we can
                    communicate with the greatest number
                  of people.  

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          22.

                  You have the press to deliver your
                  message.  Why not move the ships?  

    Anna is clearly growing annoyed.  Chad fights to keep his
    position in the moving scrum, himself growing pissed at the
    aggression building around him.

                                    ANNA
                  We prefer to speak directly to the
                  people.  

                                    REPORTER #3
                  But you could just talk through us.

                                    U.N. SECRETARY
                  She already answered you.  No more
                  questions, please.

    The U.N. Secretary tries to keep it cordial while hustling
    Anna into the building, but the press are persistent.

                                    REPORTER #4
                  Some scientists say it's impossible
                  for Visitors and Human's to have
                  evolved along such similar paths. 
                  What do you say to them?  

                                    ANNA

                  These are serious questions - why
                  don't you give serious answers?

                  Why don't you have more respect?!  

    That stops everyone cold.  Including Anna.  She eyes Chad. 

                                    ANNA
                  Do you have a question?  

                                    CHAD
                  Yeah, I have a question... Is there
                  such a thing as an ugly Visitor?  

                                    ANNA
                  I don't understand.

                  Thank you.  You're not so bad

    Laughter.  Anna smiles at Chad, and then...

    Several FBI agents mill about in the aftermath of executing
    a search.  A frustrated Erica and Dale stand near an old
    farmhouse getting a report from another FBI agent.

                  Place's been in receivership for two
                  years - no one lives here.  Canvassed
                  some of the neighbors.  No one
                  remembers seeing a white truck.  Looks
                  like another dead end. 

    Erica starts to head off in frustration.  Dale follows.

    She suddenly stops.  Stares suspiciously at a pair of storm
    cellar doors that lead underground.  Off her look:

                  Storm cellar?  In the midwest maybe,
                  but in Ventura? 

    She pulls open one of the doors.  A nasty odor wafts out.

    The shuttle rises from the roof of a downtown skyscraper
    whose helipad has been converted to a sending/receiving
    station for mothership transport.

    As it gains altitude it quickly picks up forward momentum,
    gliding effortlessly through the blue sky.  

    The tiny shuttle is seemingly swallowed up by the monstrous
    ship as it enters the shuttle bay.

    Georgie glares at him a moment, then scribbles something on
    a scrap of paper.  Tosses it at Ryan.

    Father Jack heads down the street toward the church.  He comes
    upon a crime scene.  A man lying in the street.  Nothing new
    on this block.  

    But then Jack notices the man's shoes -- brown loafers. It's
    the man from the confessional.  Jack steps to a COP.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  What happened?

                                    COP
                  Random shooting.  Said he was headed
                  to the church.  You know him, Father?

                                    MAN
                        (spots Jack, calls out)
                  Father...  

    Jack looks to the cop for permission to go to him.  The cop
    nods.  Another cop tending to the man lets Jack through and
    gives them some privacy.  

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                  I was coming to see you -- The V's
                  did this to me-- 

    The man pulls out an envelope, an address on the front.

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                  Please, take this to that address. 
                  Give it to the people there.  

                                    FATHER JACK
                  What is it?

                  Promise me -- Please, it's important... 

    And he starts to COUGH and WHEEZE.  The cops step in, but
    it's too late.  The man dies.  A shocked Father Jack looks
    down at the address on the envelope.

                                          ACT FIVE

    FADE IN:


    Erica stands at a large gate punching in the passcode.  The
    lock opens.  She heads inside.


    A shadowy figure stands in the darkness at the side of the
    building.  As he peers around the corner, a shaft of light
    strikes his face and we see... 

    ...it's Ryan.  

    He clocks the security gate entrance, but hesitates.  Stands
    there agonizing over whether to go in or not. 

    We still know very little about his past with Georgie, but
    the one thing we do know -- going into that meeting somehow
    puts Val and Cass at risk.  


    Ryan's finally made up his mind to go inside.  But just as
    he starts for the security gate...  

    Several cars QUIETLY pull up to the factory; their lights off.  

    Ryan ducks back into the shadows.    


    Outside, Dale has now spotted the numerous shadowy figures
      surrounding the building. 

                                    ANNA (V.O.)
                  That embracing change is never easy -
                  but the reward for doing so can be
                  far greater than anything you can
                  imagine.  

    He quietly exits the car...


    The meeting's over. The 25 or so members of the group exit
    the building, and start to head off, going their separate
    ways.  

    CAMERA finds Erica, her mind swimming from the information
    she's just received.  Father Jack tags along with her, a
    little freaked.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  Bravery's not really my strong suit. 
                  I'm more the cower in the corner type.

    Strangely, his less than heroic tone is a little endearing... 

                                    ERICA
                  I'm not a hundred percent convinced
                  there's anything for you to be afraid
                  of yet, Father.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  Call me Jack. 

                                    ERICA
                  Erica.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  What percentage of concern would you
                  say you have -- Erica? 

    Before she can say anything they are suddenly TACKLED.

    A blur of images as numerous assailants unleash a violent
    attack on all the members of the meeting.  Fists fly as
    Erica tries to fight off one of the thugs.    

    Father Jack, likewise taken down by an assailant, swings
    wildly, connecting several times.  Despite characterizing
    himself as a coward, he's pretty good with his fists.

    All the other members from the meeting are likewise fighting
    for their lives in one big melee.

    Georgie is being pummeled by a thug who's pulled a blade. 
    The thug lunges, about to stab Georgie when suddenly
    OOOOOF...

    He's taken down in a hard tackle... by Ryan.  The two flail
    fiercely, grappling for the knife.  The thug reaches it first. 
    Lunges.  Slashes a deep gash in Ryan's forearm.  Blood gushes. 

    Erica flips her assailant around, about to deck him, but is
    surprised to find... it's Dale.  Relieved, she relaxes her
    stance, thinking they mistook one another...



                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          55.

                                    ERICA
                  Jesus, Dale...

    But there's no mistake on his part.  He grabs her by the
    throat.  Erica falls to her knees next to a pile of debris. 
    Shocked as hell.  Face bright red.  Gasping for air.  

    She manages to kick him off.  But he quickly comes at her
    again.  As he does, she reaches for the debris pile and
    WHAM, slams him in the head with a loose brick.

    He slumps to the ground.  Erica dives on her now unconscious
    partner, as Jack, having subdued his opponent, rushes to her.

    Incensed, she grabs Dale by the collar.  Pulls him upright.

                                    ERICA (CONT'D)
                  What the fuck's wrong with you?!

    His limp head falls forward, bleeding from the blow; a chunk
    of flesh sliced wide open from the brick.  And that's when
    she's thunderstruck to see, underneath the gaping wound... 

    ...A LARGE MASS OF GRAY, REPTILIAN SKIN... 

                                    ERICA (CONT'D)
                  Jesus CHRIST!

    Her partner's a fucking Visitor!  Erica and Jack are stunned. 
    She leans in, touches the skin, rubs it the wrong way,
    upending several large scales.  Fucking unbelievable.  

    A few yards away, Ryan having just subdued his opponent,
    rises, out of breath, looks at the carnage. 

    Most of those from the meeting now lie dead.  The scene
    profoundly effecting both him and Georgie.  But there's no
    time to mourn.  The thugs, having dispatched the others,
    now turn their sights on our heroes.  Ryan grabs Georgie
    and takes off.  

    Erica and Jack, likewise see the killers heading for them
    and tear into the night. 


    Ryan and Georgie hunched over, trying to catch their breath. 
    Ryan winces in pain.  Hand clamped over the gash in his arm. 

                                    GEORGIE
                          (freaked)
                  Where the fuck did they come from?!   
                  We were so careful this time!

                                    RYAN
                  Georgie--

                                    GEORGIE
                        (tears in his eyes)
                  You were right to walk away - what
                  hope do we have against them?

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          56.
    CONTINUED:

                                    RYAN
                  Georgie, listen to me.  There is
                  hope.

                                    GEORGIE
                        (beside himself)
                  They're fucking animals.  This is
                  the second time we've tried to start
                  a resistance and both times the V's
                  stomped on us before we even got out
                  of the starting gate.  They're all
                  fucking animals!

                                    RYAN
                        (beat)
                  Not all of them.

    Ryan removes his hand from his arm showing Georgie the deep
    six inch gash across his forearm.  Georgie's eyes go wide. 
    Underneath the bloody flesh wound is Ryan's real skin.

    ...COARSE REPTILIAN SCALES! 

    Georgie lurches backward, in shock.  

                                    RYAN (CONT'D)
                  I was wrong to run away from this. 
                  You were right to fight.  There are
                  others like me, Georgie.  Other
                  "traitors" to the cause.  We'll help.

    Georgie is speechless.  Ryan clamps his hand back over his
    wound, turns and starts to head off.

                                    GEORGIE
                  Where're you going?  
                        (no response)
                  Don't you walk away, we need you. 
                  Humanity needs you if we're going to
                  survive.

    Ryan stops and looks back.

                                    RYAN
                  I know.

                                    GEORGIE
                  Then where're you going?

                                    RYAN
                  Home... To tell Val I'm leaving. 
                  It's not safe for her to be around
                  me anymore.
                        (beat)
                  You were right, I can't just sit on
                  the sidelines - too many lives at
                  stake.                                                                                          57.
