LOUELLA
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are
not doing Hearst.
WELLES
I am not doing Hearst.
INT BUNGALOW. VICTORVILLE DAY
Mank and Houseman watch nervously as Welles reads the last page of
their massive screenplay.
The script, almost half a foot high, is piled on a table next to
Welles.
He sets down the last page and looks at Mank. A beat
WELLES
It's 350 pages long.
MANK
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
WELLES
It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
He leaps up and embraces Mank
WELLES
Housey, get us a drink.
Houseman glances at Welles, surprised, but dutifully scampers inside.
WELLES
I told you you could do this! How could you have
ever doubted me!? You must never doubt me again!
Mank laughs
MANK
It's good, huh?
WELLES
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's
terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of
course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . .
exactly . . .
MANK
What?
WELLES
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think
we need to change the name.
MANK
The title?
WELLES
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from
God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that!
I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster
Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I
was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
MANK
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
WELLES
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
MANK
(weakly)Craig is one syllable
WELLES
But it's not a great syllable
Houseman returns with a tray of drinks. Welles hands glasses all around
as:
MANK
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been
drinking since I started on this--
WELLES
( toasting)
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
Mank is stunned Welles smiles and drinks.
INT CAR. DESERT ROADS DAY
Welles sits in the back of his limo as his chauffeur speeds him back to
Los Angeles.
He goes through the script with a fervent intensity. He crosses out
huge sections and tosses away entire pages. The' floor around his feet
is littered with discarded pages.
Mank sits drinking heavily as the sun sets in the distance Houseman is
busy packing in the house behind him.
Houseman notices Mank and goes to him They stare at the crimson of the
setting sun for a moment
MANK
I'm out, aren't I?
HOUSEMAN
Welcome to the world of Orson Welles.
We focus on Mank's glowering face. But the background is somehow
different. We are at...
INT MANK'S CAR NIGHT
Late at night. Mank is sitting in his car, drinking from his flask and
listening to period jazz music from the car radio. He is parked outside
Welles' house, waiting and seething and very drunk.
He sees Welles pulling into his driveway and climbing out of his car.
Mank takes a final swig and then bolts after him, carrying a script. .
.
EXT WELLES ' HOUSE FOLLOWING
Mank roars unsteadily up to Welles:
MANK
YOU FUCK! YOU SELFISH FUCK!
Mank flings the script in Welles' face. Welles recoils
WELLES
Jesus Christ --
MANK
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY,
REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE -
- REMEMBER THAT?!
Mank snatches up the script and thrusts it in Welles' face
MANK
Pal from the studio sent this -- you see that?!
What does it say?! WHAT DOES IT SAY ORSON?!
Welles bats the script away:
WELLES
Get away from me--
Mank pushes the title page of the script toward Welles as
MANX
It says AMERICAN by Orson Welles. YOU TOOK MY NAME
OFF THE FUCKING SCRIPT!
WELLES
It's obviously a mistake, Manki Some steno girl
made a mistake, alright?!
MANK
You can't do this to me--!
Welles spins on him:
WELLES
(savagely)
I fucking well can! I own your script and I can do
anything I goddamn want. And don't forget for one
minute that I took your 350 pages of drunken
rambling and I made a movie out of them -- and now
I've got to shoot the bastard. So thank you very
much, I have all I need. And you can stop calling
me.
He goes into his house and slams the door.
Mank leans against the door in stunned exhaustion. Then he slides down
the door and sits leaning against it.
MANK
(quietly)
I hope you choke on it. I hope it kills you.
Inside the darkened House, Welles is leaning against the front door.
Silent.
INT ,, SAM SIMEON. ASSEMBLY RQOM NIGHT
The Assembly room is Hearst's private sanctum high in a tower at San
Simeon.
Marion is valiantly trying to piece together a huge jigsaw puzzle.
Hearst enters and goes to her. He puts his hand gently on her shoulder.
MARION
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some
kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a
temple to you? I can't see it myself--
HEARST
(quietly)
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
Marion stops working at the puzzle. She does not look up. Beat
HEARST
She said no
A pause. Then:
Marion slowly reaches out for the puzzle and delicately place a piece
in the proper position.
MARION
There. That's right.
HEARST
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in
peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
MARION
(not looking up)
Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks
I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...
(she clenches her fists)
will.
A long, difficult pause
HEARST
I'm so sorry.
Marion slowly stands and walks to a liquor cabinet and pours a stiff
drink.
Hearst watches sadly, but doesn't say a word
INT SCHAEFER'S OFFICE. RKO LOT DAY
Welles paces before Schaefer's massive desk with typical combustible
energy. Behind the desk, huge picture windows show the bustling
activities of the RKO lot.
WELLES
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think
of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF
UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it
-- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that
strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid,
Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
SCHAEFER
CITIZEN KANE
WELLES
Pardon?
SCHAEFER
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
Welles muses
WELLES
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the
eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF
ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
SCHAEFER
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
The budget projections on this--
WELLES
(theatrically)
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of
me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to
save money but to cut more would be to--!
SCHAEFER
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've
stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems
like, while the stockholders in New York were ready
to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was
set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract
stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's
gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about
that?
A beat
SCHAEFER
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think
again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
WELLES
Jesus
SCHAEFER
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's
happy. You make some money and New York's happy and
you have a track record and then we'll move on to
KANE.
WELLES
Please don't ask me to do this.
SCHAEFER
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong
with that.
A long pause as Welles leans against a wall, his head down He does not
look at Schaefer as:
WELLES
(simply)
George, I want you to let me make this movie
because I need to make it. And I don't really know
why. Afterwards there' II be all the time in the
world to make money and sell popcorn. And I'll do
that for you. For RKO and New York. But for now ...
please let me tell this story.
A beat. Welles finally looks up at Schaefer
WELLES
It's your decision, George. If you look into my
eyes right now and say, go make WAR OF THE WORLDS, I
will. I'll make it. And, yes, it'll make you money.
And I honestly can't think of a reason in the world why you should let
me do KANE other than that you should.
A long pause as Schaefer studies Welles. Then
SCHAEFER
If it'll get you the hell out of my office, go
ahead and make the picture.
Welles drops his head, too moved to speak.
Then he nods to Schaefer and begins to leave.
SCHAEFER
Say thank you, Orson.
Welles glances at him.
SCHAEFER
For the title
WELLES
(smiles)
Ah, it's a grand title.
He sweeps out. Schaefer smiles and shakes his head.
SCHAEFER
Like it would kill him to say thank you
EXT SOUND STAGE. RKO LOT DAWN
The sun is just rising on the RKO lot. We note a sign on the wall by
the sound stage door:
CITIZEN KANE. RKO PRODUCTION #281. DIRECTOR: ORSON WELLES
ABSOLUTELY NO
ADMITTANCE.
INT RKO SOUND STAGE FOLLOWING
Absolute silence.
Welles stands in the mammoth sound stage and looks around, it is as if
he has entered a great cathedral. A few lights illuminate portions of
the stage and giant lighting rigs and scaffolding soar to the unseen
ceiling miles away.
The Xanadu Great Hall set awaits.
Welles slowly walks to the set and stands, surveying his domain,
savoring the moment.
Title: JULY 30, 1940
He clears his throat and speaks, rehearsing his first day speech to the
cast and crew. His voice echoes.
WELLES
Today we - -
He stops, surprised by the echo.
WELLES
Today we are going to break every rule in motion
picture history...
No . . We are going to shatter every rule in
Today we are going to shatter the hallowed busts of Griffith and
DeMille and Ford. We are going to show the world a new way of seeing.
Together we will blaze a trail...
As Welles continues to rehearse we slowly ascend the scaffolding and
lighting rigs...
WELLES' VOICE
Together we will throw away all the maps and we
will become -joyously lost in the wilderness. And
the future cartographers of Hollywood will forever
chart our course. Following our lead...
We continue to ascend and finally discover two electricians on the
upper catwalk, staring down in amusement, much like the two stagehands
at the opera in KANE.
WELLES' VOICE
And do you know why we're going to do this?
Again to Welles on the stage floor: A beat. Welles slowly smiles.
WELLES
We're going to do this because it's going to be
fun.
Above, one of the electrician's throws the switch on a huge spotlight.
Welles is captured in the vibrant white light and Benny Goodman's
immortal "SING, SING, SING" immediately explodes and we are into:
THE MAKING OF CITIZEN KANE
A camera crane sweeps dramatically to the ceiling of the sound stage
and brilliant white lights flash on.
A film clapper snaps: CITIZEN KANE. RKO PRODUCTION 281 DIRECTOR:
ORSON
WELLES.
And we see Welles racing heroically into making his first movie:
In varying KANE makeups he tears through scenes and actors: laughing
with AGNES MOOREHEAD on the cabin set; charming RUTH WARRICK on
the
breakfast table set; berating DOROTHY COMMINGORE on the Great Hall
set...
He speeds back and forth and back and forth from the set to the camera
in the Campaign Headquarters set, never happy with the shot. . .
Gregg Toland watches, bemused, as Welles shifts tiny prop pieces on the
set. . .
Welles bullies and screams and pleads and seduces. Like an obsessed
artistic tornado he is seemingly everywhere at once. We see him
rejecting matte paintings and in makeup and rewriting the script and
trying on costumes and selecting props and leaping into odd positions
looking for the perfect camera angle.
It is very important in this sequence that we see the pressure building
... building ... building ... on Welles.
"SING, SING, SING" continues On the Xanadu stairway set Welles behind
the camera, filming actor Paul Stewart
PAUL STEWART
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
WELLES
Again.
A film clapper: take 58
PAUL STEWART
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
WELLES
Again.
A film clapper: take 59
PAUL STEWART
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
WELLES
Again
"SING. SING, SING" continues...
in a corner of the sound stage:
Welles, in full Kane makeup, studies a miniature model of the Kane
Campaign Headquarters set through a tiny periscope with cinematographer
Gregg Toland.
WELLES
It needs a ceiling, Gregg. Real rooms have real
ceilings.
GREGG TOLAND
You want a ceiling on this one too?
WELLES
You bet.
GREGG TOLAND
Gonna be tough
WELLES
(smiles)
No, it's gonna be impossible. That's why we're
doing it.
SING, SING, SING" continues Back on the Xanadu stairway set: Poor Paul
Stewart, now at his wit's ends, continues:
PAUL STEWART
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
WELLES
Again
The film clapper: take 112.
PAUL STEWART
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
WELLES
Again
Paul Stewart screams and collapses. "SING, SING, SING" continues... On
the Atlantic City nightclub set:
Welles watches as the camera crane attempts the dizzying and difficult
maneuver from the skylight at the top of the set
down to Dorothy Commingore as Susan Alexander below. The camera crane
goes out of control and crashes through some light fixtures and swings
crazily down toward Dorothy Commingore. She yelps and leaps away as the
camera barrels through the table and smashes to the floor.
Welles stands next to Toland. A beat.
WELLES
Well, that didn't really work
"SING, SING, SING" continues. Back on the, Xanadu stairway set
Paul Stewart, dazed and shattered, is listening intently. Welles stands
with his arms around Stewart, embracing him, whispering into his ear.
WELLES
It is the most important line of the picture. You
will weave the magic of "Rosebud" in a single word -
- you will say the word in such a way as to impart
to us the mystery of it. It is a divine and sinister
mystery worthy only of your talent. In this one word
the movie soars or falls. Once more, I beg you.
Stewart nods. The film clapper: take 178.
The cameraman leans into the viewfinder. We see his black- and-white
view of the shot through the lens then:
In a cramped editing room we see Welles watching the scene on an old
editing moviola.
On the moviola we see Paul Stewart taking a deep breath and then,
magnificently:
PAUL STEWART
(On moviola)
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
WELLES' VOICE
(On moviola)
Print. ;'
On the moviola we see Stewart laugh hysterically and dance away.
In the editing room, Welles shakes his head
WELLES
Actors.
"SING, SING, SING" continues. On the Campaign Headquarters set:
Welles and Toland lie on the floor of the Campaign Headquarters set and
gaze up through viewfinders. They squirm about on the floor and laugh
to one another about their newest outlandish idea.
Then Toland notices something in the catwalks high above the set. A
redheaded ELECTRICIAN.
TOLAND Orson, you see that electrician up there? The redhead.
He was
on GRAPES OF WRATH. He's a free- lance studio spy. Probably reports
right back to the RKO boys in New York.
Welles slowly stands and THUNDERS:
WELLES
STOP EVERYBODY STOP!
All the flurried activity on the sound stage immediately stops.
Every eye turns, terrified, to Welles. Welles glares up at the
redheaded electrician
WELLES
YOU COME DOWN HERE!
The electrician slowly climbs down from the rafters. Welles rivets him
every step of the way.
The electrician stops before Welles.
ELECTRICIAN
Mr. Welles...?
A tense beat and then Welles fiercely and purposefully spits in the
electrician's face.
The electrician recoils, stunned.
WELLES
GET OUT
Welles returns to Toland as the electrician slinks off "SING, SING,
SING" continues as:
We see the magnificent film emerging. Welles watching scenes in a
screening room, his feet up, exhausted, almost asleep, a cigar dangling
from his lips...
We see rushes of Welles going through scenes with Dorothy Commingore as
Susan Alexander. He is relentless with her off camera, driving her to
the harridan outbursts he wants just before he steps into the shot...
We see the crew observing, with great amusement, Welles' stumbling
attempts to learn the "Charlie Kane" dance...
We see Toland shifting lights to achieve deep-focus cross-fades. Welles
rages as the difficult process eats up time...
We see Welles growing increasingly manic. The long hours and the
pressure are clearly taking a toll..
We return to the screening room. Welles is now fully asleep. His cigar
falls from his mouth and begins smoldering on his suit.
"SING, SING, SING" fades at... On a Xanadu set:
Filming a scene. Welles, in old-Kane makeup, is sitting with Dorothy
Commingore as Susan Alexander. He is curiously distracted. She is
pouring tea in the scene:
DOROTHY COMMINGORE
"Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking
at things . "
Welles does not respond. He breaks character
WELLES
No -- no -- I'll pour the tea. Sorry. I should pour
the tea. Let's try that again.
Toland stands behind the camera and watches Welles. There is obviously
something wrong.
WELLES
Okay, here we go... Set. Action
Welles pops into character and pours the tea in the scene as:
DOROTHY COMMINGORE
"Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking
at things . "
Welles stops, breaks character again:
WELLES
No -- that's not right
He clears his throat and glances at the enormous crew, all staring back
at him expectantly.
WELLES
Urn. . . ah . . . yes -- you should definitely pour
the tea. Okay, again. Sorry.... Set. Action.
They start the scene again. She pours the tea
DOROTHY COMMINGORE
"Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking
at things . "
A pause as she waits for his reply in the scene He sits, frozen.
TOLAND
Orson, you wanna take five?
WELLES
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
He slowly walks off the set as he nervously pulls at his tie, tearing
it off.
Toland watches him go.
INT BROWN DERBY DAY
Louella is at her usual corner booth, on the phone to one of her many
spies. She is devouring a Cobb salad as she hears:'
PHONE VOICE
I don't know if this means anything but I just
talked to a guy in the RKO art department They've
got all these books and crap all over the place.
Pictures of San Simeon.
Louella instantly stops eating
PHONE VOICE
For the Welles picture.
LOUELLA
Pictures of the castle?
PHONE VOICE
Yeah
LOUELLA
Thanks, doll. Get me more.
She hangs up, intrigued.
INT WELLES' HOUSE
Welles is standing, absolutely lost, in the middle of his living room.
He is still in his old-Kane makeup which is just beginning to peel off
his face.
We hear a low, insistent drum beat, a Gene Krupa riff.
We hear the sound of an ice pick chipping into a block of ice. Welles
glances around. We are no longer in Welles' living room but at. . .
INT MANK'S HOUSE. SANTA MONICA DAY
A turntable spins in a corner, playing a Gene Krupa record. Ashtrays
overflow with cigar butts and messy piles of pages are littered around
a typewriter.
Mank's beach house is tiny and on the edge of squalid
Welles, still in his peeling old-Kane makeup, is standing in the middle
of the living room and Mank is in the small kitchenette, chipping ice
for drinks.
A long pause
WELLES
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking
at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
MANK
Uh huh.
WELLES
I just can't . . see it anymore
Mank returns to the living room and thrusts a drink in Welles hand.
WELLES
I want you back
MANK
Fuck you. (He sits.) You wanted me out. I'm out.
WELLES
I'm sorry.
MANK
I don't care.
Welles hands Mank a folded script from his jacket. Mank looks at it as:
WELLES
This is the shooting script we've been using every
day.
Sure enough, the title page of the script reads: CITIZEN KANE by Herman
J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles.
WELLES
It's just like we always said it would be
Mank hands it back
MANK
Too late, kid.
Welles sits.
WELLES
Did I ever tell you about my father?
MANK
I don't give a shit about-
WELLES
He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was
ashamed of him.
A beat. Welles proceeds quietly and with difficulty.
WELLES
He showed me the world, he took me with him
everywhere -- Europe, China -- and he was so proud
of me. But he would drink and he would get
...embarrassing. And I began to resent him Because I
was so ... sparkling, you see.
So I cut him dead. I turned my back and I walked away because I didn't
need him. He was getting in the way of my "genius." And he would write
me letters, and I never answered them, and he would call me, and I
never took his calls, and he showed up at school and I wouldn't see
him.
Tears are beginning to inch down Welles' face
WELLES
When I finally saw him again, he was in a coffin. I
was fifteen. And all of a sudden he wasn't that
embarrassing drunk anymore ... he was the man who
showed me the world.
Welles looks up at Mank, tears now streaming down his face.
WELLES
Just like you, Mank.
A long beat. Mank, despite himself, is moved.
To cover his emotion Mank rises and goes into the kitchen to freshen
his drink. We remain tight on Welles as we hear Mank's voice:
MANK'S VOICE
So you've lost it? Don't know who should pour the
tea.
WELLES
Yeah
A beat
MANK'S VOICE
Orson ... just cut the goddamn tea
WELLES
Okay
A beat. Welles reaches for a cigar, tears still wet on his face.
MANK'S VOICE
I been thinking about the beach scene. You done
that yet?
WELLES
No
MANK'S VOICE
Good -- cause I was thinking that we're starting
the scene too late...
Welles quickly bites off the end of his cigar -- his expression one of
"Gotcha!" -- even as. his cheeks are still wet with tears.
MANK'S VOICE (CONT.)
Cause if we don't show Susan watching Kane more
then we're not building the right tension into the
scene. See, she's gotta know that...
Welles slowly smiles as the record of Gene Krupa's percussion segues
into the unmistakable rhythms of "SING, SING, SING" and eclipses Mank's
voice...
And we see Welles everywhere, more energized than ever: perilous on a
high crane; stuck in a cramped corner behind the camera; doing magic
tricks for the cast; sleeping as makeup is applied to his face...
Mank is always at Welles' side: supporting; challenging; amusing;
inspiring. . .
We see Welles strutting, raging, boasting, dancing. And again towering.
"SING, SING, SING" finally ends at..
Through the black-and-white viewfinder we see Welles, in full costume
and makeup, carefully walking across the massive Kane Campaign
Headquarters set toward us. We see the low angle black-and-white
camera's perspective.
TOLAND'S VOICE
Closer ... closer ... closer -- stop. We just lost
your head.
WELLES
Can you see my shoes?
TOLAND'S VOICE
Yeah, but we lose your head.
WELLES
Goddamn it Joe -- stand here
JOSEPH COTTON, also in full costume and makeup, steps into the shot and
takes Welles' position as Welles scurries out of the frame. . ..
INT SOUND STAGE. RKO NIGHT. FOLLOWING
Welles marches across the set and squirms into position at the camera,
which is right on the floor, and peers up through the viewfinder.
Toland lies next to him. Mank stands to one side and- watches.
WELLES
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We
have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring
to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
TOLAND
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
WELLES
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also
Joe back there--!
TOLAND
I know what you want but it can't be done!
WELLES
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a
few more inches down and then tilt up--
TOLAND
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any
fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
Welles thinks for a moment and then bolts up. Toland watches,
mystified, as Welles races to a sound stage fire station and grabs a
fire axe. Welles storms back to the set and raises the axe high. Toland
quickly rolls away. And Welles slams the axe into the wooden floor of
the set. He continues to hack at the floor.
WELLES
Come on, Gregg! We'll tear out this floor!
Welles and Toland and various grips hack at the floor
Mank watches, bemused, and checks his watch
Welles and Toland finally tear away the remnants of the wooden floor.
They stare down, defeated. Under the wood is solid concrete.
Welles and Toland stand and stare at the concrete
TOLAND
It's midnight, why don't we pick it up tomorrow?
Welles does not answer. He continues to eye the concrete Then:
WELLES
Get me a jackhammer.
We see a grip pounding away at the concrete with a jackhammer as
Welles, always in motion, sweeps past Mank and Joseph Cotton.
MANK
(wryly, to Cotton)
There but for the grace of God, goes God.
Welles slams to a halt in front of the unit physician and thrusts out
an arm. The physician injects him with a dose of B-12.
Welles can barely wait for the injection before he speeds off.
Welles supervises as Toland lowers the camera into the freshly dug hole
in the middle of the sound stage. Mank checks his watch, 3:30 AM.
Welles leaps into the trench to check the camera setup.
Again we see the view through the black-and-white viewfinder. Joseph
Cotton stands at a distance, at the far wall of the set.
WELLES' VOICE
Okay, Joe . . . come closer . . . closer
We see Cotton approaching. He finally stops inches away from the
camera. His shoes and the far wall of the set are both in total focus.
It is a breathtaking, vertiginous shot.
Then we see Welles and Joseph Cotton rehearsing and rehearsing and
filming and filming the scene. Endlessly
Finally we seem to be seeing the scene from the movie
WELLES
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss
Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've
set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All
right, if that's the way they want it, the people
have made their choice. It's obvious the people
prefer Jim Gettys to me."
JOSEPH COTTON
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As
though they belonged to you. As long as I can
remember, you've talked about--" (he breaks
character)
Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
We continue to watch the scene through the viewfinder:
WELLES
(to the camera operator)
Keep filming.
JOSEPH COTTON
I can't remember the lines!
WELLES
Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
He shoves Joseph Cotton brutally
WELLES
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy.
Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
JOSEPH COTTON
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some
of us humans need sleep!
Welles shoves him again.
WELLES
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look
right at the monster and you tell him--
JOSEPH COTTON
(deeply)
"You don't care about anything except you. You just
want to persuade people that you
JOSEPH COTTON (CONT.)
love them so much that they ought to love you back.
Only you want love on your own terms. "
WELLES
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms.
Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his
own."
Welles/Kane drinks. A long pause.
WELLES
Cut. Print
We jump out of the black-and-white viewfinder and into the scene as
Welles turns to an assistant.
WELLES
How 'bout a real drink?
TOLAND
We done?
WELLES
Yeah.
The crew members exhale and practically collapse
Welles stands and looks around in satisfaction. He takes in the empty
corners of the sound stage, the sets, the cameras Savoring the moment.
WELLES
(quietly)
It's finished.
He walks to the massive doors of the sound stage and pulls them open.
Sunlight floods in.
Outside it is a blazing morning and the dazzling sunlight silhouettes
Welles.
Welles squints and steps into the glorious sunlight. Mank and Toland
follow. They stand and watch as RKO extras and crews bustle about on
their way to work. The assistant brings a tray of martinis.
They each take a glass. The RKO workers stare at them oddly as they
pass.
Welles toasts them.
WELLES
Good morning, good morning. . .
He grabs a passing extra and dances with her as Mank and Toland laugh.
EXT HEDDA'S MANSION. PATIO MORNING
Hedda Hopper reclines on her patio. An extremely ugly pug dog sits in
her lap. She has green goo all over her face and a cigarette dangling
from her lips.
Title: THREE MONTHS LATER. JANUARY 3, 1941
She is going through the trades. She stops at a particular item. She
studies it and then reaches for the phone and dials.
HEDDA
(on phone)
Orson, Hedda here! You naughty boy! You told me

see your masterpiece and here I read in the Reporter
that there's a screening tonight for the magazines
... yes, advance deadlines, I understand . . . (she
smiles) . . . oh, rough cut, uh-huh ... Been there,
Orson, know the drill. See ya tonight!
She hangs up. Her hideous dog leaps on her and starts licking her face
goo.
HEDDA
Get offa me, ya little prick
INT OUTSIDE AN RKO SCREENING ROOM NIGHT
Welles paces nervously outside the doors to the screening room.
Schaefer stands leaning against a wall.
From inside we can hear some of the final dialogue from CITIZEN KANE.
WELLES
This is an abomination There's no music and--
SCHAEFER
They've all seen a rough cut
WELLES
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did
we have to let her come?!
SCHAEFER
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of
martinis and you pray.
Silence from inside the screening room. The movie is over. An agonizing
silent pause
Then the doors swing open and the guests stream out. Totally neutral
expressions.
The bejeweled Valkyrie, Hedda herself, finally emerges. She stops
before Welles.
A beat.
She reaches up and pinches his cheek, a bit too hard. And then she
slaps his cheek, a bit too hard.
And then she goes
WELLES
What the hell did that mean?!
EXT HEDDA' S MANSION. PATIO MORNING
Hedda paces and smokes as she waits on the phone. Finally, she is
connected:
HEDDA
(brightly)
Why hello, Mr. Hearst! I'm so delighted you could
take my call. I just wanted to let you know -- I saw
this Orson Welles picture last night. First
screening ever, don't cha know, and, Mr. Hearst, I
don't understand something . . . (she smiles
wickedly) ... I just don't understand why Louella
hasn't told you it ' s all about you. . . Yes, oh
yes . . . My pleasure, sir.
She hangs up
HEDDA
Take that, you old cow
INT SCHAEFER'S OFFICE
DAY
Schaefer sits at his desk, going through some budget sheets. His
intercom buzzes, he presses a button:
SECRETARY'S VOICE Mr. Schaefer, Miss Parsons is here
SCHAEFER
(into intercom)
Here? As in right outside the door?
SECRETARY'S VOICE
Yes, sir
SCHAEFER
(chipper, into intercom)
Well, send her in!
He releases his intercom button
SCHAEFER
Shit
He bolts up and races to the liquor cabinet as Louella sweeps in like
the Lusitania in fur.
LOUELLA
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
SCHAEFER
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would
you like--?
LOUELLA
(eyeing gossip)
You drink at 10 am, do you?
SCHAEFER
No -- no -- I mean--
LOUELLA
I wanna see the picture today
SCHAEFER
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is
scoring the picture now and he's very particular
about the music--
LOUELLA
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me
to see the picture today.
SCHAEFER
He personally asked you to?
LOUELLA
That's right
Beat
SCHAEFER
Hearst?
LOUELLA
Uh-huh
Beat
LOUELLA
I'll be back at noon. Set it up in screening room
four.
She sweeps out
SCHAEFER
Oh god
INT RKO SCREENING ROOM DAY
Louella watches CITIZEN KANE
We watch her enormous face, grim and glowering, bathed in flickering
blue light as we hear a bit of the dialogue:
" KANE "
"You'll continue with your singing, Susan. I don't
propose to have myself made ridiculous. "
"SUSAN ALEXANDER"
"You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous
I What about me?! I'm the one that's got to do the
singing! I'm the one who gets the razzberries!"
With that, Louella bolts up and stomps out of the screening^ room... '
INT OUTSIDE THE SCREENING ROOM FOLLOWING
Welles and Schaefer are again nervously waiting in the hallway.
Louella slams out the door and almost crashes into Welles A beat as she
glares at him. If looks could kill She storms off
Welles and Schaefer are too stunned even to speak as we hear:
LOUELLA'S VOICE
It is . . . assassination.
INT SAN SIMEON. ASSEMBLY ROOM DAY
Hearst sits with one of his dachshunds on his lap Louella sits across
from him.
Hearst does not move a muscle in the entire scene.
LOUELLA (CONT.)
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and
the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the
castle. And ... Marion.
HEARST
How so?
LOUELLA
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man
spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's
opera and not movies. And...
HEARST
Yes?
LOUELLA
(quietly)
The drinking.
A beat
HEARST
(very controlled)
So my life is a subject for mockery. All of it.
Every detail. Every personal detail.
Louella nods.
A beat.
HEARST
Thank you for your time
LOUELLA
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
A beat
A pause
HEARST
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for
you.
LOUELLA
Sir?
(stops)
HEARST
Why did we not know about this sooner?
LOUELLA
Sir?
HEARST
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and
ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide
this simple service you are of no use to me.
LOUELLA
Sir, I-
HEARST
(lethally)
Please be quiet.
A young man has made a motion picture detailing my life. This motion
picture was made at a not insignificant studio. And you knew nothing
about it.
LOUELLA
He lied to me
LOUELLA
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about
you.
HEARST
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
A beat.
LOUELLA
I want blood
HEARST
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from
this day forth. It shall nourish us both
She nods and leaves the room We linger on Hearst, his expression dark
and dangerous.
INT SCHAEFER'S OFFICE EVENING
Welles reclines on a sofa, smoking a cigar, orating, while Schaefer
sits at his desk absently flipping through the evening edition of the
LA EXAMINER.
WELLES
Give me one dinner with her and I'll sort it out.
Woman of a certain age are woefully susceptible to a
younger man's charm. I'll make myself so
monumentally attractive that
He is distracted by Schaefer flipping through the newspaper anxiously.
Schaefer tears back and forth in the paper and then swivels around in
his chair to grab another newspaper. He flips through it. And then
stops.
SCHAEFER
(sickened)
Oh Christ...
Welles leaps up and goes to Schaefer's desk.
Schaefer has placed the two newspapers side by side on his desk.
He points to one
SCHAEFER
This is the morning edition of the EXAMINER.
He points to the other
SCHAEFER
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
WELLES
The ad..
Indeed, the morning edition contains a large ad for the RKO movie KITTY
FOYLE. In the evening edition the ad has been replaced by innocuous
copy.
SCHAEFER
They dumped our ad.
He flips through the evening edition and then looks up at Welles.
SCHAEFER
(quietly)
They dumped all our ads.
INT MAYER'S OFFICE DAY
Louis B. Mayer sits at his massive desk, taking notes Hearst sweeps in.
Mayer is surprised.
HEARST
Louis
MAYER
Randolph!
HEARST
Hope you don't mind my popping in--
MAYER
No -- no -- sit down, please
HEARST
(sitting)
What a wretched place this is. I can't come to town
without feeling filthy. You really must buy that
parcel of land by the castle and come north.
I only wish I could. You know, business
HEARST
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you
heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
MAYER
Over at RKO?
A beat.
HEARST
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
MAYER
(confused)
Uh-hub.
HEARST
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher
like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you
follow so far?
MAYER
Yeah
A beat.
HEARST
I can't see how the release of that picture will do
anyone any good, really.
HEARST
Say, while I'm in town why don't we play 18 holes
at Bel Air? Or maybe just nine. Do you have time for
a round today?
He gazes at Mayer. Mayer looks at him, disquieted
A pause.
A beat
HEARST
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn
and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
MAYER
(quietly)
You know that can't happen.
HEARST
Oh, why is that?
HEARST
Why is that, Louis?
MAYER
Bel Air is restricted.
HEARST
Oh, that's right. How silly of me to have
forgotten. I sometimes forget that you're all Jews.
Lots of people forget that. If they ever knew it.
A tense pause
HEARST
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE
picture, won't you?
MAYER
(quietly)
Yeah
Hearst stands.
HEARST
And you'll come out to the castle soon, I hope
Marion and I would love to see more of you.
He smiles and goes. Mayer sits, shaken
INT BROWN DERBY NIGHT
Schaefer sits with Louella in her corner booth
LOUELLA
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an
RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never
see the light of day.
SCHAEFER
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you
have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can
work something out--
LOUELLA
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
SCHAEFER
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
LOUELLA
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that
you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in
history if you release this picture. He'll bleed
your little studio dry and you can all go on back to
New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
SCHAEFER
Can I talk to Hearst?
LOUELLA
You are talking to him.
INT
SAN SIMEON. ASSEMBLY ROOM
DAY
Hearst stands with his arms behind his back, very Kane-like, and
surveys a collection of about 30 newspapers spread around the floor at
his feet. His newspapers.
Marion sits in a corner, doing needlepoint. Hearst picks up one of his
papers
HEARST
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
MARION
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president,
after all.
HEARST
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the
end of the year. I think I'm going to run that
wheelchair picture.
MARION
Don't
She holds up her needlepoint
MARION
Whaddaya think?
It is a sampler reading: BLESS THIS CASTLE He laughs
JOE WILLICOMBE, Hearst's private secretary, enters quietly. Willicombe
is a serious and sensitive man in his 60's. He is unquestioningly loyal
to the old man.
WILLICOMBE
Sir, we got the call.
A moment. Hearst looks at him. Willicombe shakes his head sadly.
HEARST
Thank you, Joseph.
Willicombe glides out
A long pause as Hearst moves to a window and stares down at his domain.
Marion watches him.
MARION
How bad is it?
HEARST
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
MARION
Pops

HEARST
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on
the debts.
MARION
How much?
HEARST
It's not really--
MARION
How much?
A -beat
HEARST
125 million.
She is absolutely stunned. A pause
MARION
(softly)
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
HEARST
Yes.
A pause
Hearst continues to gaze out the window. Marion goes to him and holds
him tenderly. ;
They look down at the massive San Simeon estate spreading out like
Wonderland below them.
INT
MARION
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
HEARST
One . . . buys things.
INT RECORDING STAGE NIGHT
KANE composer BERNARD HERMANN stands before an orchestra, going over
some of the music for KANE. He tries various measures and makes
adjustments. A movie screen is ready to run sections of the film.
Welles sits at the back of the room, talking quietly to Gregg Toland.
Welles is bewitching, spinning a web:
WELLES
We open on Monument Valley. Those towering
stalagmites reaching up like pleading fingers to
God. A single figure treads the arid plains. The
crimson sun is behind him so his shadow stretches
toward us. He is a simple man wearing a simple robe.
A profoundly quiet and sad man. Who is he?
Bernard Hermann turns back to Welles and Toland
BERNARD HERMANN
Orson, please..
WELLES
(whispering, to Toland)
Who is he, Gregg?
TOLAND
(realizing)
Oh, no--
WELLES
Yes!
TOLAND
He's Christ?
WELLES
I'm Christ
TOLAND
You want to do the life of Jesus?
WELLES
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso
sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the
whole thing in the gallant American West--
Mank joins them, carrying a newspaper.
MANK
Hey, kid. Gregg.
WELLES
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new
picture but I'll go back--
MANK
No, you gotta hear this-
BERNARD HERMANN
(snapping back at them)
I'm trying to work here!
WELLES
Sorry, you keep at it, old boy.
He leads Toland and Mank out of the stage and into the sound proof
recording booth...
HOOVER
Open a new file. Heading: Welles, Orson. Native
born. Communist.
HILLS AROUND SAN SIMEON
DAY
Marion and Joe Willicombe sit in deck chairs under the blazing sun.
Marion absently pets a dachshund in her lap. Servants stand behind them
with lunch and trays of iced tea
They watch Hearst riding a horse in the distance A pause. Then:
MARION
How bad is it?
WILLICOMBE
Miss Davies--
MARION
Come on Joe. How bad is it?
A beat.
WILLICOMBE
It's finished
Hearst gallops up to them. A servant helps him down from his horse. He
strides briskly to Marion and Willicombe as:
HEARST
I've been thinking about the Tribune in Chicago.
The Examiner just can't make any headway.
Circulation is still down. I think we should buy the
Tribune.
Marion glances to Willicombe and then looks at Hearst with great
tenderness.
MARION
Sure, Pops. That's a swell idea
INT MANK'S HOUSE. SANTA MONICA DAY
Manks pounding away at a typewriter in his tiny beach house.
He grumbles to himself as he types:
MANK

the Son of God" ... big Toland lighting effect ...
blah, blah, blah ...
A knock at the door. Mank answers it. Clean-cut FBI Agent McCabe stands
outside. He flashes his badge.
AGENT McCABE
Mr. Mankiewicz, I'm Special Agent McCabe of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Might I have a
moment of your time?
MANK
Sure, kid, come in. I'm writing the crucifixion and
it's a bitch. Sit down
Agent McCabe sits and snaps open a note pad
AGENT McCABE
I would like to ask you a few questions about Mr.
Welles.
MANK
You guys after Orson too?
AGENT McCABE
Mr. Mankiewicz.
MANK
Shoot
AGENT McCABE
Are you aware of Mr. Welles' Communist
affiliations?
MANK
Shit, Orson's no pink. He's everything else under
the sun, but he's no pink.
AGENT McCABE
Are you aware of Mr. Welles' Communist
affiliations?
MANK
No, I am not
AGENT McCABE
Do you have any knowledge of Communists working
within the motion picture industry?

in touch.
Agent McCabe leaves
MANK

Don't bother, you low-life prick
Mank slams the door
He stands for a moment, pale, and then goes to the kitchen and pours
himself a stiff drink.
INT SAN SIMEON, ASSEMBLY ROOM DAY
Marion is pouring a drink as well. She quickly fills a glass of Scotch
and then begins striding back and forth across the Assembly Room.
Hearst sits quietly at one of the jigsaw puzzles He occasionally and
absently puts a piece in place.
She has clearly been at him for some time
MARION
Then you explain it to me?!
HEARST
There's nothing to explain
MARION
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues
and there's nothing to explain?!
HEARST
I will not defend my life to you--
MARION
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in
a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
HEARST
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would
euphemistically have it.
MARION
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
HEARST
There is nothing to discuss-
MARION
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the
truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say
it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't
buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g-
goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
HEARST
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need
the Tribune to--
MARION
You don't need it! That's the problem you always
think you need everything--
Marion spins to a medieval arras cloth hanging from one wall.
MARION
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
HEARST
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
MARION
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
HEARST
You needn't use that language with me
MARION
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
HEARST
I wanted it
MARION
There's a different between want and
HEARST
(tightly)
Not for me.
MARION

But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so
everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
He stands quickly
HEARST
(angrily)
That's right. You've captured me exactly.
Goodnight.
MARION
You will not walk out on me
HEARST
You are repellant when you drink.
MARION
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--

mercilessly mimics her) t-t-t-tolerate it.

HEARST

I will not have this in my home.
MARION

gathered around him.
Mayer nods his head to each as we pan around the faces

I say to hell with Louella and to hell with Hearst!
Bring 'em on. We can take em.
HARRY COHN
We all didn't make GONE WITH THE WIND, ya know.
Some of us gotta look at this checkbook-wise.
MAYER
Who isn't hurting already? All this Jew talk and
these Communist rumors. Look, he's boycotting RKO
ads right now -- but how long before he takes on
Warners or Fox or Columbia?
HARRY COHN
Goddamn right.
A beat.
MAYER
And if Hearst goes public with all this filthy
private lives stuff, Hollywood's sunk. He's got us
nailed. Dates. Times. Photographs for God's sake.
WALT DISNEY
I don't mean to be funny, but what could he have on
Mickey Mouse?
MAYER
He's got you so tied in with J. Edgar Hoover and
America First that you might as well put on a brown
shirt and kiss those happy little kiddies so-long.
DAVID 0. SELZNICK
(suddenly)
Have any of you actually seen the movie?
A beat.
DAVID 0. SELZNICK
I have. It's probably the greatest motion picture
ever made. Nothing's going to be the same after

Who the fuck cares?
DAVID 0. SELZNICK
I do. And so should all of you--
JACK WARNER
Get off the soapbox--

MAYER
We will buy the movie and we will destroy it.
MAYER
We will assemble a fund between us -- privately,
'not studio money -- we will assemble this fund and
we will go to George Schaefer and we will buy the
negative and every print of CITIZEN KANE and we will
burn them.
A long pause
MAYER
If I do not hear an objection to this agenda in the
next five seconds I will assume the motion has
carried.
Five seconds tick by as we focus on the titans of Hollywood
MAYER
Very well, my associates will be in touch to
arrange payment. Thank you for your time.
INT RECORDING STAGE DAY
KANE composer Bernard Hermann again stands before the orchestra, his
arm poised, waiting to begin conducting. He is about to record some new
music for the deep-focus Thatcher/Bernstein/Kane scene from CITIZEN
KANE.
Welles sits nearby, supervising everything. Welles nods and on a movie
screen the scene from KANE begins and Hermann starts conducting. The
orchestra plays.
The music carries into and gradually fades during.
INT SAN SIMEON. ASSEMBLY ROOM DAY
In a scene eerily reminiscent of the Thatcher/Bernstein/Kane scene,
Marion sits in the extreme foreground, a man we do not know sits at
middle distance at a desk and Hearst stands far away.
Hearst has his back to them and stares out a window.
The new man is MR. LEWIS, a tight banker from New York, 50's.
He looks over a thick legal document on the desk as he speaks:
LEWIS You will retain some editorial control over the remaining
newspapers but the actual ownership will go to the Conservation
Committee and the banks. We will be immediately closing 12 of the
papers and the wire services. And we will be liquidating other assets
as soon as possible. Most of the land in Mexico as well as your
collection of art and antiquities--
MARION
(quietly)
Mr. Hearst spent his life collecting that art.
LEWIS
(ignoring her)
We've been in touch with Gimbels in New York and
they've agreed to hold a special sale. They're
giving over an entire floor for the merchandise.
You'll have to go there in person to sign the bill
of sale, by the way.
HEARST
(softly, not turning)
I'll have to sell the animals.
LEWIS
And we don't know whether we'll be able to retain
the castle. The land has some capital and we might
keep it on as an investment. Maybe break it up into
smaller units for housing.
A long pause Hearst finally turns and walks to them.
HEARST
(to Lewis)
When will it come out? When will the public know?
LEWIS
We can't keep it a secret, sir. Once we announce
the Gimbels sale and start liquidating the assets.
MARION
(pained)
This is your whole life. Pops. Don't do it. We'll
find another way..
A long beat as he looks at her. Then he quickly signs the document on
the desk. He puts down the pen and leaves the room without a word
INT SAN SIMEON. STAIRWAY NIGHT
Marion sits nestled on a sweeping marble stairway Weeping
INT NIGHTCLUB. HOLLYWOOD NIGHT
A swank benefit dinner is in progress A band plays
A banner hangs over the nightclub stage: CHILDREN'S MILK FUND BENEFIT,
1940
We float through the elegant crowd and spy Louis B. Mayer and Louella;
Clark Gable and Carole Lombard; all manner of movie stars and power
brokers.
We also spy Schaefer sitting with Mank and Toland and a few other men
and women.
The evening's EMCEE takes the stage
EMCEE
Next up we have a real treat. It's Orson Welles.
Now, during the rehearsal for the benefit tonight
Orson banished everyone from the club so he could
proceed in utmost secrecy. But you all know how
Orson is!
Laughter from the crowd
EMCEE
So, lets give a big round of applause for Mr. Orson
Welles and Miss Rita Hayworth.
Polite applause as Welles bounds to the stage with RITA HAYWORTH and
the band begins to play a buoyant tune.
Schaefer practically drops his fork
Welles is dressed in a padded costume and made up in a way that can
suggest no one but William Randolph Hearst. Rita Hayworth is dressed in
a manner mightily like Marion Davies.
Louella glances to Mayer, daggers. Some knowing laughter from the
audience. Particularly Mank
A line of chorus girls hoof on and join Welles and Rita Hayworth as a
row of harsh footlights snap on, giving the scene a resemblance to the
"Charlie Kane" dance in CITIZEN KANE.
And Welles launches into a jaunty song and dance version of
"DISGUSTINGLY RICH" an almost unknown Rodgers and Hart song;'. Welles
has wickedly changed some of the lines. '
WELLES
"I'll buy everything I wear at Saks. I'll print
gossip and I'll call it facts
RITA HAYWORTH
"Swear like a trooper, Live in a stupor--
WELLES AND RITA HAYWORTH
"Just disgustingly rich!
WELLES
"I'll make money and I'll make it quick, Starting
little wars I think are slick. Smother her in
sables, Like Betty Grable's-- Just disgustingly
rich.
"I'll build a castle, That'll cost a passel.
And as a resident, I will pan the president I'll
aspire, Higher and Higher. "I'll get married and
I'll buy a girl, So darn pretty that your head will
swirl
RITA HAYWORTH
"Swimming in highballs-- Stewed to the eyeballs--
WELLES AND RITA HAYWORTH
"Just disgustingly rich!
Welles, Rita Hayworth and the chorines do a nifty soft-shoe turn as
Schaefer turns to Mank:
SCHAEFER
(seriously)
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
MANK
Yeah, ain't it swell?
Welles and Rita Hayworth conclude their little dance break and Welles
resumes the song:
WELLES
"Ev'ry summer I will sail the sea, On my little
yacht the Normandie, Pet my little dachshund
friends, Kiss Louella's big rear end, Just
disgustingly rich.
About here Louella storms out.
"I'll eat salmon, I'll play backgammon. Turn breakfast into brunch,
I'll take Thomas Ince to lunch I'll aspire, Higher and Higher.
About here Louis B Mayer and a few others storm out.
RITA HAYWORTH
"He'll be photographed with Myrna Loy, Just to
prove he is a glamour boy.
WELLES
"Perfumed and scented, Slightly demented-- Just
disgustingly rich
RITA HAYWORTH
"I'll get my capers, Into his papers. Hoping his
folly would Lead me out to Hollywood. I'll aspire,
Higher and higher.
About here Schaefer buries his face in his hands
WELLES AND RITA HAYWORTH
"In the funnies and the valentines, We'll be
pictured drinking Ballantine's. Dopey and screwy,
Voting for Dewey.
Just disgustingly-- Too, too
disgustingly-- Riiiiich! "
Welles and Rita Hayworth conclude the number with a big flourish.
Some applause
Mank stands and applauds loudly. Laughing. Welles bows solemnly to Mank
EXT NIGHTCLUB FOLLOWING
Later that night, Welles is about to climb into his limousine outside
the nightclub with Rita Hayworth when Schaefer suddenly appears and
grabs his lapel.
WELLES
(happily)
George- -!
Without a word, Schaefer pulls Welles roughly into an alley beside the
nightclub. He slams Welles into the alley wall.
SCHAEFER
(brutally)
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how
many people RKO employs?! You know how many people
depend on what we do for a living?!
WELLES
I really think you're
SCHAEFER
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death-
wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down
with you!
WELLES
It was a -joke, George
Schaefer slaps Welles firmly across the face. Welles is stunned.
SCHAEFER
There are no jokes! There are people making a
living. There is food on the table!
Schaefer glares at him and then rages off
Welles straightens his suit and then, with a shaking hand, reaches for
a cigar. He tries to laugh, but cannot.
INT SCHAEFER'S OFFICE. RKO DAY
Schaefer sits at his desk, absolutely dazed. Speechless
B. Mayer sits across from him.
SCHAEFER
Where did this money come from?
beat
MAYER
It came.
MAYER
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget
and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a
profit on the deal.
SCHAEFER
Very generous
MAYER
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and
every existing print.
SCHAEFER
To do what?
MAYER
That's for me to decide.
SCHAEFER
You're going to destroy it
MAYER
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man
kicks it.
SCHAEFER
You're lying to me.
MAYER
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Schaefer is stunned.
SCHAEFER
You talked to New York?
MAYER
Yes
SCHAEFER
You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
Pause.
MAYER
Yes
SCHAEFER
Get out
MAYER
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time.
You'll never pull it off.
SCHAEFER
Get out.
Mayer stands and smiles
MAYER
This picture, George, it'll just break your heart.
Mayer goes. Schaefer sits, smelling defeat.
We linger on Schaefer as a haunting echo of "I CAN'T GET STARTED" is
heard. . .
INT/EXT SAN SIMEON NIGHT
We float through the estate as we hear the ghostly strains of Bunny
Berigan's recording of "I CAN'T GET STARTED."
It is a sad journey.
By this time many of the ornate antiquities have been removed from the
castle and it resembles Welles' stark and dreary Xanadu all the more.
BUNNY BERIGAN
"I've flown around the world in a plane, I've
settled revolutions in Spain, And the North Pole I
have charted, Still I can't get started with you...
We float past the private zoo, now empty, the cages hanging open. We
move past the tennis courts, empty.
BUNNY BERIGAN
"On the golf course I'm under par, Metro Goldwyn
has asked me to star, I've got a house, a show
place, Still I can't get no place with you.
We float into the castle itself and through the stripped- down
Screening Room and the Assembly Room and the Great Dining Hall.
All are mere shadows of their past glory.
BUNNY BERIGAN
"Cause you're so supreme, Lyrics I write of you, I
dream, dream day and night of you And I scheme just
for the sight of you, Baby, what good does it do...?
We finally float into the ballroom
A record of "I CAN'T GET STARTED" spins forlornly on a turntable.
And Marion and Hearst are having a quiet, poignant dance together in
the middle of the empty ballroom.
BUNNY BERIGAN
"I've been consulted by Franklin D. Greta Garbo has
had me to tea, Still I'm broken hearted Cause I
can't get started with you.
They finally stop dancing and stand swaying gently. Then they stop
swaying.
HEARST
(gently)
Ah, Miss Davies, the times we have seen
She holds him closely as "I CAN'T GET STARTED" concludes
INT CHASEN'S RESTAURANT. PRIVATE ROOM DAY
Welles has booked a private room at Chasen's. A long banquet table
contains cans of sterno heating various dishes.
Large photographs of the American West and renderings from THE LIFE OF
CHRIST are scattered around other tables.
Welles wanders around the renderings with Gregg Toland and Mank. Welles
carries a plate of food and consumes as:
TOLAND
See, this is the Great Salt Lake -- we do the
baptism here.
MANK
Great scene where John the Baptist pulls your head
out of the water and says, "Look up, and behold your
destiny"
WELLES
Is that from one of the Gospels?
MANK
Kinda.
Schaefer enters.
WELLES
George! Enter And Behold
Schaefer blinks at the massive photos and renderings.
WELLES
You're not still mad at me, I hope
SCHAEFER
No, we're jake. But listen-
WELLES
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've
found natural locations for the whole story--
SCHAEFER
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found
somewhere to premiere KANE but--
WELLES
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did
Radio City come crawling back?
SCHAEFER
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something
else.
Welles stops eating
SCHAEFER
I think you better sit down
WELLES
(evenly)
I don't want to sit
Beat.
SCHAEFER
The bosses -- the other studios -- they want to buy
the film and destroy it.
Absolute silence
Pause
SCHAEFER
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the
negative and all the prints.
SCHAEFER
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
MANK
(quietly)
Oh God.
SCHAEFER
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and...
Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as
Welles looks at Schaefer
Welles suddenly FLINGS his plate of food in Schaefer's direction as he
ROARS:
WELLES
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS
HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO
SELL IT!?
MANK
This ain't George's doing--!
Welles- rampages around the room
WELLES
I PUT MY LIFE INTO THAT PICTURE -- EVERYTHING I'VE
BEEN -- EVERYTHING I COULD BE---IT'S CITIZEN KANE! -
- IT'S ALL CITIZEN KANE!
And in a screaming, bellowing fury, Welles tears apart the room.
In a scene sharply reminiscent of Kane destroying Susan's bedroom,
Welles rampages around the room, upsetting tables and smashing
everything in reach.
Welles finally grabs a flaming can of sterno and flings it at Schaefer,
Schaefer knocks it away.
Then Welles stands in spent exhaustion, panting. One of his hands is
bleeding.
He looks at Schaefer. A pause. Then:
WELLES
Let . . . me . . . talk to them. . .
New York ... The stockholders
Give me one chance. And then you will never have to see me again.
