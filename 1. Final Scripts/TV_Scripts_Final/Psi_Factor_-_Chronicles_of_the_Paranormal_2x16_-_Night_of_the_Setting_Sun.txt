      FADE IN:

      EXT. H.L. STEPHENSON & SONS: FRONT GATE - NIGHT

      The entrance to an abandoned factory complex from the 1800s.

      FRANCO, a punk in his early twenties, wearing shiny white
      running shoes, sniffs the cold night air.  RATTLES the gate.

                                      FRANCO
                    It's locked.  It's been locked
                    forever.

      With an apologetic smile, he turns to...

      CLAUDIA VICKERS.  Vickers is in her early thirties, fit and
      well put together in a Roots-style bomber jacket.  She's too
      glamorous to be skulking around an old factory late at night.

                                      FRANCO (CONT'D)
                    Over here.

      Franco walks away from the gate and along the high brick
      wall.  Vickers follows.

                                      VICKERS
                    What about security?

      Franco tries to put her at ease.

                                      FRANCO
                    Ms Vickers, I've been in and out of
                    here four, five times.  I got you
                    covered.

      Franco piles up discarded crates to form makeshift steps
      against the brick wall.

                                      FRANCO (CONT'D)
                    That's why I was thinking, I know we
                    said six hundred.  But really it
                    should be more like seven-fifty.  To
                    be fair.

                                      VICKERS
                    Franco, let's see if you found what
                    I'm looking for.  Then we'll talk.                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 2.

      Franco and Vickers clamber to the top of the wall.  They
      swing over and drop inside the complex.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. H.L. STEPHENSON & SONS - NIGHT

      Vickers and Franco skulk along.  Franco nods.  This way.

      POV THE WATCHER

      Observes, unseen, as Vickers and Franco step into...

      EXT. H.L. STEPHENSON & SONS: COURTYARD - NIGHT

      MOONLIGHT cuts through the clouds.  Their FOOTSTEPS ECHO.

      They look at each other.  Vickers is starting to lose her
      nerve.  But then Vickers spots something.

                                      VICKERS
                          (excited)
                    There.

                                      FRANCO
                    See.  I told you.

      Vickers unfolds a large square of light canvas from her jacket
      pocket.  Holds it in front of herself.

      POV THE QUARRY

      As Vickers' canvas covers it and blocks out the light.

                                      VICKERS (O.S.)
                    Got it.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. H.L. STEPHENSON & SONS - NIGHT

      Vickers and Franco head to the gate.  Franco carries a LIVING
      CREATURE wrapped inside the canvas.  It squirms and SCREAMS.

                                      FRANCO
                    Geez.

      POV THE WATCHER

      Something's coming at them.  Fast.                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 3.

      BACK TO FRANCO AND VICKERS

      As the unseen circles them.  They run like thieves.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. H.L. STEPHENSON & SONS: ALONG THE WALL - NIGHT

      FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPLEX --

      Vickers hauls herself to the top of the wall.  Turns back. 
      Holds out her arms.

                                      VICKERS
                    Give it to me!  Now!

      With a fearful backward glance, Franco hands Vickers the
      package.  It's SQUIRMING.

                                      VICKERS (CONT'D)
                    Hurry!

      Vickers jumps down to the ground.  Turns.  Looks for Franco.

      Franco manages to get his shoulders and arms onto the top of
      the wall.  He muscles his torso up top.  He's going to make
      it.  He swings his legs around.  But...

      Something pulls him back down.

                                      FRANCO
                    Ms Vickers!  Help me!

      Franco clings to the wall's rim but he is losing the battle.

                                      VICKERS
                    C'mon!

      And Franco is gone.

                                      FRANCO (O.S.)
                          (high-pitched, shriek)
                      Noooooooo!

      And then, worse - SILENCE.  Beat.

                                      VICKERS
                    Franco!

      Something moves on the far side of the wall.  Vickers runs
      into the night carrying the squirming bundle.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

      DAN AYKROYD draws us into the story...

                                    DAN AYKROYD
                    Like many people, I have long been
                      fascinated by cryptozoology, the
                    study of rare and sometimes mythical
                    animals.  Normally these creatures
                    live in remote areas, largely
                    untouched by man.  But could it be
                    possible for a previous unknown 
                    creature to survive undetected in
                    the center of a modern city?

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. H.L. STEPHENSON & SONS: FRONT GATE - DAY

      Even in the daylight, the factory complex looks forbidding. 
      Abandoned.  Untouched since the 1880's.

      MATT PRAEGER (late 30s, intense) trails after L.Q. COOPER.

      Praeger is the Case Manager, the team leader of a group of
      scientific operatives who investigate the strange and
      paranormal for the Office of Scientific Investigation and
      Research (OSIR).

      Cooper is the team cryptozoologist.  He is an odd little man
      whose eyes swim behind his thick glasses.

                                      COOPER
                          (simmering)
                    Vickers calls herself an
                      ornithologist.  But she's really
                    just an animal smuggler.

                                      PRAEGER
                    And Elsinger authorized how much?

                                      COOPER
                    We paid $74,000.

                                      PRAEGER
                          (teasing Cooper)
                    That's good money for a rat with
                    wings.
                          (off Cooper's look)
                    It's a pigeon.                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 5.

                                      COOPER
                    Matt, Vickers sold us a passenger
                    pigeon.  They've been extinct since
                    1914.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Yup, In Search of...the Psi Pigeon.

      Praeger considers the factory complex.

                                      PRAEGER (CONT'D)
                    Coop, you sure this is the place?

                                      COOPER
                    Vickers found it around here.  It's
                    possible that a roost of passengers
                    survived this century in these old
                      buildings.

                                      PRAEGER
                    This is practically downtown.
                          (intrigued)
                    Why hasn't this land been developed?

                                      COOPER
                    You can ask the owner.

                                      PRAEGER
                    If he ever gets here.

                                      COOPER
                    I don't understand why he's late. 
                    Mr. Stephenson was very cooperative
                    on the phone.

      A LATE MODEL SEDAN rumbles past them to a stop, about twenty
      feet away, next to the gate.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Well, let's see a man about a pigeon.

      Cooper and Praeger approach the car.  They find...

      STEPHENSON (early twenties, ashen, expensive clothes) slumped
      in the front seat.  Praeger knocks on the window.  Stephenson
      pulls himself upright, clinging to the steering wheel.

                                      PRAEGER (CONT'D)
                    Mr. Stephenson?

      Stephenson rouses himself.

                                      STEPHENSON
                    Yeah, right.                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 6.

      He emerges from the car leaving the door open.  Praeger shoots
      a glance towards Cooper and gently closes the car door for
      Stephenson.

                                      COOPER
                    I'm L.Q. Cooper.  This is Matt
                    Praeger.

      Stephenson lurches towards the front gate.

                                      STEPHENSON
                    Don't know why no one ever called
                    before.  Don't know why.  But...
                          (coughs)
                    I didn't even know about them until
                    my father died.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Who?  The pigeons?

      Stephenson flails about, distraught.  Guilt ridden.

                                      STEPHENSON
                    The workmen.  I didn't know.  But
                    you knew about them, didn't you, Mr.
                    Praeger?  The workmen?

                                      PRAEGER
                    Whoa, you're going too fast.

                                      STEPHENSON
                    That's the real reason you called. 
                    I'll show you everything.  It's the
                      responsible thing to do.  I'm a
                      responsible boy.

      He laughs until he dissolves into HACKING COUGHS.

                                      PRAEGER
                    You okay?

                                      STEPHENSON
                    Right as rain.  Here we are.

      Stephenson unlocks the front gate.  He keels over.  Crumples
      to the ground.

                                      PRAEGER
                      Stephenson!

      Cooper bends to examine him.

      As blood bubbles from Stephenson's mouth --

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 7.

      EXT. H.L. STEPHENSON & SONS: FRONT GATE - DAY

      The back door of an ambulance SLAMMING SHUT.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL

      Cooper and Praeger watch the ambulance pull away.

                                      PRAEGER (V.O.)
                    Case log update.  We are attempting
                    to determine the point of origin of
                    a species of bird long thought to be
                    extinct.  Our investigation has been
                      complicated by the sudden death of
                    our contact, Neal Stephenson.

      Praeger nods to DR. CLAIRE DAVISON (35, trim, efficient) as
      she gets into her OSIR vehicle.

                                      PRAEGER (CONT'D)
                      Pathologist Claire Davison will
                    conduct the autopsy.  Praeger out.

      Cooper and Praeger are joined by PETER AXON (28, well-dressed,
      a bit of a hot shot) and DR. ANTON HENDRICKS (60, scholarly). 
      Axon carries techno-gak.

      The others follow Praeger onto...

      EXT. H.L. STEPHENSON & SONS: MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

      A cobblestone street lined with eight old factories and
      stores.  At the end of the street you can look up and see an
      elevated expressway.  Hear the cars BUZZ by.

      Cautiously, they move forward.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    Good muscle tone.  Something of a
                    looker, our Mr. Stephenson.  If this
                    was myocardial infarction it must
                    have a congenital source.  Those

                          (surprised)
                    Crusted with blood.

      She turns his head to the side.  Opens his mouth.  Blood
      dribbles out.  She looks inside.

                    Blood in the mouth.  He died so fast
                    he didn't even have time to swallow. 
                    Could be respiratory failure.

                    No, Anton.  That is a common pigeon,

                                      HENDRICKS
                    All right.  So what does a passenger
                    pigeon look like?

                    Can't.  I'm under quarantine.  The
                    best I can do is forward materials
                    to the health authorities to help

      Axon, Praeger and Hendricks confer.  Praeger is answering
      Hendricks' question.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Yes.  She was quite specific.  Spanish
                      Influenza.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    That's impossible.  That strain hasn't
                    been seen since 1919.

                                    AXON
                          (bit nervous)
                    Anton, you're talking about the flu
                    here.  How bad could it be?

                                      HENDRICKS
                    During the 1918 flu pandemic, millions
                    perished.  More people died from it
                    than in the trenches of World War I.

                                    AXON
                    So how did they stop it?

                                      HENDRICKS
                    They didn't.  Without explanation,
                    the strain disappeared.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Until today.  And we were exposed to
                      Stephenson.

                                    AXON
                    And we were exposed to you.  So we
                    could all have it.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Not necessarily.  In 1918 many
                    hospital workers never picked up the
                    infection at all.  Or they survived
                    thinking they'd just had a cold.

      Axon sneezes.  Everyone looks at Axon.  Axon rolls his eyes.

                                      HENDRICKS (CONT'D)
                    But its victims, predominately young
                    men, often died within forty-eight
                    hours.

                                    AXON
                      Wonderful.  What about antibiotics?                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 12.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    They won't work on a virus.  We need
                      a vaccine.  And to find the source
                    of the outbreak before it spreads.

                                    AXON
                    Maybe we should turn ourselves in
                    for quarantine.

      That gives Praeger an idea.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Maybe we should stay right here. 
                    This is pretty isolated.
                          (wry to Axon)
                    Here's your chance to get away from
                    it all.

                                    AXON
                    Great.

                    So how did a bird and a virus not
                    seen in eighty years pop up here at
                    the same time?  Could the pigeon be
                    a carrier of the virus?

                                      COOPER
                    Possibly.  One theory is that flu
                    strains originate when avian flus
                    and swine flus combine with human
                    strains.  It's called viral sex.

                    Kinky.

                                      COOPER
                    New flu strains usually start in
                    migratory birds.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Pigeons don't migrate.

                    It's just orange juice with added
                    glucose.

      INT. LUMIERE BUILDING: BENNING'S OFFICE - DAY

      Donner talks with LISA BENNING, late 30s, stylish.  In
      contrast, her office is a small and undistinguished.

      Benning SNEEZES.

                                      DONNER
                    Bless you.

                                      BENNING
                    Ragweed.  Every fall.

      Donner hands her a card.

                                      DONNER
                    This is the city health office.  You
                    should check in with them.

                                      BENNING
                          (uneasy)
                    Thanks.  I just saw Neal last week. 
                    He seemed fine.

                                      DONNER
                    How well did you know him?

                                      BENNING
                    Neal was a client I inherited from
                    my dad.  The fourth and last
                      generation to guide H.L. Stephenson
                    & Sons.

                                      DONNER
                    Who takes over now, Ms Benning?

                                      BENNING
                    I guess I do.  His will creates a
                    trust to preserve the factory complex
                    as a private historical site.

                                      DONNER
                    The OSIR could recommend historians
                    to work with you on this project.

                                      BENNING
                    Thank you, but we'll manage.

                    Who are the trustees?

                                      BENNING
                    There's only one.  Josef Schullman. 
                    I believe he's a friend of Neal's.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 16.

                          (abruptly)
                    I've never met him.  Ms Donner, I
                    want your colleagues to leave the
                    factory.  It's dangerous.  The
                      floorboards are rotted through. 
                    It's a firetrap.

                                      DONNER
                    Really?  Then why is it still
                    producing furniture?

                                      BENNING
                    Where did you hear that?

                                      DONNER
                    Your annual report.  Aren't company
                    directors personally responsible for
                    fire safety violations?

                                      BENNING
                    What do you want?

                    Just access for a few days.

      With a sigh, Benning nods her agreement.

                    Don't leave town.

      Cooper heads off.  Axon and Praeger set off in the other
      direction.  No signs of life.  Axon admires the buildings.

                                    AXON
                      Beautiful.  You know, I think I would
                    have loved to live in the 1890s.  An
                    age of new possibilities.  Scientists
                    were like rock stars...

      Axon listens to something in the distance.

                                    AXON
                    You hear that?

      They listen.  In the distance, faint, is the SOUND of a
      skipping rope SLAPPING against stone.  A reedy, little girl's
      voice drifts towards them:

                                    GIRL (O.S.)
                    I had a little bird...and its name
                    was Enza...

      The wind shifts and wipes away the sound.

                                      PRAEGER

      No response.

      Cooper enters the vast room.  Peers into the darkness.

      On the floor he finds some DROPPINGS.  Scrapes them up into
      a metal container.

      Cooper hears a faint WHAMP.  He stands up.  Listens carefully.

      Cooper caps the container.  Behind him the floorboards CREAK
      and MOAN.  Cooper wheels around.

      There's no one there.

      Cooper exhales.  He cautiously makes his way further into
      the room.  He spots...

      AN OLD FASHIONED CHICKEN COOP

      Inside, passenger pigeons COO.

                                      COOPER
                    Wow.

      Cooper reaches out to the pigeons.

                    What is that -- you got a chill?

                    You heard what Anton said.  If you've
                    got the bug, you should head back to

      He moves close to Axon.  Whispers in his ear.

                                      PRAEGER
                    It's just my spidey sense going off. 
                    Someone is watching us.

      They wait, watch and listen.  In the distance, a DOOR BANGS.

      They race towards the source of the noise.  Turn a corner of
      a building to find --

      A door BANGING in the wind.  They dash through it and into...

      A large old fashioned workshop.  Praeger feels the hackles
      rise on the back of his neck again.  Are they being watched?

      Pause.  Quiet.  They listen again.  Nothing.

      Axon pulls a drop cloth off of a pedal-powered lathe.

      Praeger finds straight-backed chairs with round legs.

                    No.

                                      PRAEGER
                    But please keep your distance.  We
                    may be sick with  influenza.  It
                    killed Mr. Stephenson.

                                      ELENA
                    We all had the grippe ages ago. 
                    Poor Mr. Stephenson.  He must have
                    caught it from us.

      Praeger catches Axon's eye.  Gives him the high sign.  Axon
      walks over to Sophie.

                                    AXON
                    My name's Peter.

                                      SOPHIE
                    I'm Sophie Schullman.  Very pleased
                    to meet you, Sir.

                                      ELENA
                    I'm Elena Schullman.  That's my
                    cousin, Josef.

      Josef lowers the shotgun.

      Axon hands Sophie the juice.

                                      SOPHIE
                    Thank you, Sir.

      She drinks thirstily.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. MOBILE LAB: CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

      The Schullmans sit around the table.  They tear into OSIR
      prepackaged rations and plates of sandwiches.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 22.

      The Schullmans eat ravenously.

      Juice dribbles over the chin of a COUSIN (male 20's).

      The Cousin leans close over his plate and rips apart a chicken
      sandwich, eating only the meat.

      Food slobbers out the side of Josef's mouth.  He wipes it
      away with the back of his sleeve.  He grabs a sandwich from
      the center of the table.  His eyes lock with his Cousin's. 
      The Cousin backs down.  Josef takes the sandwich.

      On the other side of the glass partition, Praeger and
      Hendricks watch them eat.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Charming.

      With a nod, Hendricks draws Praeger into...

      INT. MOBILE LAB: COMMUNICATIONS POD - CONTINUOUS

                                      HENDRICKS
                    They show all the early signs of
                      malnutrition.

                                      PRAEGER
                    They must have relied on Stephenson
                    for their groceries.

      Praeger finds Sophie's skipping rope on the counter.

                                      PRAEGER (CONT'D)
                    That's interesting.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    What?

                                      PRAEGER
                    The handles are made out of wood not
                    plastic.  Look at the carving.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    This is no toy.  It's an antique.

      Praeger considers this.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I want to see what Cooper found.

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 23.

      INT. H.L. STEPHENSON & SONS: PIGEON COOP - NIGHT

      Cooper and Praeger stand in front of an old-fashioned chicken
      wire set of coops.  Pigeons COO.  Sophie gives them the tour.

                                      SOPHIE
                    That's Clara and that's Lillian.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Lillian.  Nice name for a pigeon.

                                      SOPHIE
                    She's my favorite.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Sophie do you mind waiting while Dr.
                    Cooper and I talk?

                                      SOPHIE
                    No.  Are you a real doctor?

                                      COOPER
                    I'm an animal doctor.

                                      SOPHIE
                    Oh, you're a veterinarian.

      She moves away and starts skipping in the background.

                                      COOPER
                    It looks like the Schullmans bred
                    these for generations.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Why?

                                      COOPER
                    For meat.

      The FLAP FLAP FLAP of Sophie's skipping starts.

                                      PRAEGER
                    If they're eating pigeons no wonder
                    they're starving.

                                      COOPER
                      Interesting.  There's only sixteen
                    birds in the flock.  They kept the
                    bare minimum to promote genetic
                      variation.

      Praeger glances over to Sophie.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 24.

                                      PRAEGER
                    They don't look like geneticists to
                    me.

      Sophie chants as she skips:

                                      SOPHIE
                    I had a little bird.  And it's name
                    was Enza.  I opened the window.  And
                    in - flew - Enza.

      INT. MOBILE LAB: MEDICAL AREA - NIGHT

      Where Hendricks draws blood from Josef.  Josef sits in the
      med chair.  Josef's shirt is off.  Hendricks applies a cotton
      swab to the crook of Josef's elbow.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Just apply a little pressure there.

                                      JOSEF
                    No one in my family has needed to
                    see a physician for some time.  Really
                    Sir, I feel fine.

      Praeger joins them.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                          (to Praeger)
                    But you, Sir, look pale.  You should
                    work more in the sun.

      Praeger steps behind the chair and examines Josef's shirt as
      they talk.  And as they talk, Hendricks checks out Josef's
      lymph nodes.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I should.  Where exactly do you and
                    your family live?

                                      JOSEF
                    In the vicinity.

                    Sophie?  She's my cousin.  We teach
                    her at home.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Doesn't she miss having friends?

                                      JOSEF
                    We have our work, our family, our
                    beliefs, Sir.

                                      PRAEGER
                    And privacy.

                                      JOSEF
                    It is a good life.

      Josef stands up.  Praeger hands him his shirt.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    You found Barrymore.  Sophie will be
                    so pleased.

      Axon attaches his laptop to a SPECTROMETER.

                                      ELENA (CONT'D)
                          (re: the laptop)
                    That is a beautiful machine, Peter. 
                      Wonderfully crafted.  Can you show
                    me how it works?

                                    AXON
                    Sure.

      He picks up a core sample and empties some dirt into a Petri
      dish.  He slides it under the spectrometer's aperture.

                                    AXON (CONT'D)
                      I collected this soil sample this
                    morning.

      Axon fires up a program, hoping to impress her.  Numerical
      data races across the screen.  She presses closer to him,
      the better to see the screen.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 26.

                    The machine, ah, bounces light off
                    the dirt and then tells this machine
                    what minerals are there.

                                      ELENA
                      Wonderful.

                                    AXON
                    And it tells me...you are living on
                    top of magnetic rock.  Iron ore,
                    nickel, lead.  Other heavy metals.

                                      ELENA
                    And that is not good?

                                    AXON
                    It's not exactly healthy.  How long
                    have you been here?

      Elena changes the subject.

                                      ELENA
                    Have you not done enough work for

                    You planning to get me into trouble?

                                      ELENA
                    No, just out in the air.  I would
                    love a walk.

                                    AXON
                    Sure.  You can show me around.

                                      ELENA
                    No.  I mean outside the wall.  Outside
                    of here.  You can escort me.  The
                    other girls on the promenade will be
                      completely jealous.

      Praeger and Josef come around the corner.  Josef notices
      Elena's attention to Axon.

                    Elena, do not bother Mr. Axon.  We

      With a regretful glance back to Axon, Elena steps to her
      cousin's side.

                    Twelve.  Three fatalities.

      Praeger coughs.  Axon and the others look concerned.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I'm fine.

                                    AXON
                    You don't look fine.

                    Let's just say I'm waiting for the
                    other shoe to drop.

                                      DAVISON
                    Take care of him.  I'll check in

                    No current records for Josef or Elena
                      Schullman.  They've never even paid
                    income tax.

                    That could fit with their behaviour.
                          (to Praeger)
                    Have you noticed the close family
                      structure, the emphasis on work and
                    religious beliefs?  These are people
                    trying to shelter themselves from
                    modern society.

                    Perhaps Stephenson exploited their
                    fears in return for cheap labour.

                    that?

                    There was an immigration record of
                    two Schullman families landing in
                    Quebec City.  In 1905.

                    Maybe the Schullmans have been here
                    for generations.  Talk to the

      Axon and Elena.  They take their promenade.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 33.

                                    AXON
                    You know the Japanese believe that
                    magnets re-energize the iron in your
                    blood and prevent aging.  Maybe the
                    magnetic soil here is the reason for
                    your longevity.

                                      ELENA
                          (flirting)
                    Do I really look one hundred and
                    twenty years old?

                                    AXON

                                      ELENA
                    Thank you, Sir.

      Elena's gaze is a little too intense for Axon so he steps a
      few steps away.  She links her arm through his.

                                      ELENA (CONT'D)
                    Have you been to Japan?

                                    AXON
                    Yes.  I stayed with a friend of mine. 
                    His apartment was so small, the fridge
                    was in the living room.  It was
                    emerald green.  All the refrigerators
                    there are colourful because, well,
                    they're in your living room.  A fridge
                    is like an...an ice box.

                                      ELENA
                    I am not as sheltered as you think. 
                    I see the cars go by on the roadway. 
                    I used to go to the moving picture
                    shows.  Mr. Stephenson would bring
                    me books.

                                    AXON
                    Sounds like he was sweet on you.

                                      ELENA
                    He was a boy.  He wanted to keep the
                    world away from us.  I have my own
                    ideas.

      The attraction between them grows.  Elena reaches over and
      gives him a kiss.  Axon kisses her back.

      Josef violently pulls Axon away from Elena.  Josef's eyes
      glitter with anger.  He has his shotgun.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 34.

                                      ELENA (CONT'D)
                    Josef.

                                    AXON
                    Take it easy.

                                      JOSEF
                    Sir, you don't understand.

                                    AXON
                    Oh, I think I understand fine.  But
                    I'm not getting in the middle of
                    anything here.

      Axon lunges forward, grabs the barrel.  The two men struggle.

      Axon bangs Josef against the building.  And again.  Josef
      lets go of the shotgun.  Slides down the side of the building
      to the ground.

                                    AXON (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.

      Axon walks away from him.  Hands the shotgun to Elena.  Heads
      towards Praeger who has been watching the action.

                                      ELENA
                    Peter!

                                      PRAEGER
                          (overlapping)
                    Axon!

      Josef tackles Axon from behind.  Axon goes down like a sack
      of potatoes.  They wrestle in the dirt.

      WHAP.  Axon takes one across the face.  WHAP.  Again.

      Axon breaks free.  Turns on Josef and clocks him.

                                    AXON
                          (in pain)
                    Gah!

      Axon nurses his right hand.

      Josef advances and...

      BLAM!

      Elena fires the shotgun into the air.

                                      ELENA
                    Enough!                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 35.

      The fight stops.  Josef wheels and faces his cousin.

                                      JOSEF
                    I don't like the game you are playing,
                    Cousin.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Elena, why don't I hang on to that
                    for a while?

                                      ELENA
                    As you wish.

      She hands him the shotgun.

                    Now.

      Josef and Elena head into the factory building.

                          (proud of himself)
                    Not bad for a physics major.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Can I see you for a moment?

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      Axon and Praeger sit on the steps.

                                      PRAEGER
                    What did that accomplish?

                                    AXON
                    Matt, I was defending myself.

                                      PRAEGER
                    But Pete, you put yourself in that
                      situation.

                                    AXON
                    You're taking his side.

                                      PRAEGER
                    There are no sides here.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 36.

                                    AXON
                    They're lying to us.  I don't know
                    what they're hiding, but you're taking
                    their side.

                                      PRAEGER
                    We are guests here.

                                    AXON
                    Of Stephenson.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Of the Schullmans.  This feels like
                    their home.

                                    AXON
                    Like they've been here for a century?

                                      PRAEGER
                    We should step lightly.  There are
                    eight of them and four of us.
                          (re: shotgun)
                    And maybe Josef Schullman has another
                    noise maker.

                                    AXON
                    If you want me to roll over, I'll
                    roll over.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Just keep your mind on your work.

                                    AXON

                    Damn it, Pete.

      Before things get out of hand, Cooper pops out and...

                                      COOPER
                    There's a call for you, Matt.

                                      PRAEGER
                          (re: Axon's hand)
                    You want Anton to look at that?

                                    AXON
                    He'll just ice it down.

                                      PRAEGER
                    We'll continue this later.

      Praeger goes into the mobile lab.  Axon and Cooper.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 37.

                                      COOPER
                    I have to see Sophie.

      Cooper steps down off the gangplank and heads towards the
      tannery.  Axon follows Cooper.

                                    AXON
                    What's up?

                                      COOPER
                    I want to learn how the Schullmans
                    managed to breed the passengers in
                      captivity.  All attempts at the turn
                    of the century failed.

                                    AXON
                    Why?

                                      COOPER
                    The pigeons' migratory instincts
                    were so strong that they threw
                      themselves against aviary walls,
                    killing themselves.

                                    AXON
                    Hang on.  That fits.  Birds use the
                    earth's magnetic pole as a beacon in
                    their migrations.  Maybe the magnetic
                    pulses here countermanded the flock's
                    need to migrate.
                          (beat)
                    How's Lillian doing?

                                      COOPER
                    I just conducted the autopsy.

                                    AXON
                    Ah.  What killed her?

                                      COOPER

                    I have a lead on that running shoe
                    you found.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 38.

                                      PRAEGER (O.S.)
                          (through phone)
                    Great.

                                      DONNER
                    Have you seen anyone on the property
                    by the name of Franco Berri?

                                      PRAEGER
                    No.  Why?

                                      DONNER
                    Vickers left more behind than just a
                    shoe.  Franco has been missing for
                    five days.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Got you.

                                      HENDRICKS (O.S.)
                    Matt!

                                      PRAEGER
                          (into phone, to Donner)
                    I'll get back to you on that.  Thanks.

      Donner turns off her phone.  Davison and Ray arrive.

                                    RAY
                    I got us sprung.

                                      DONNER
                    How did you manage to do that?

                                      DAVISON
                    Neither of you two are symptomatic. 
                    So, you are prime candidates to test
                    out whether the existing swine flu
                    vaccine will prevent the Spanish
                    version.

      Davison pulls out a long needle.

                                    RAY
                    What's that?

                                      DAVISON
                    We think it may take.

                    You think it may take.

      Praeger joins Hendricks over at the microscope.

                                      PRAEGER
                          (to Hendricks)
                    What do you have?

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Josef and Elena both possess extensive
                    amounts of telomorase in their
                    systems.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I take it that's unusual.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Normally, you'd only find telomorase
                    in cancer cells.  It's the enzyme
                    which helps protect the chromosomes
                    and allows cells to keep reproducing.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Anton, start from the top.

                                      HENDRICKS
                          (beat)
                    Think of a cell like a shoelace.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Okay.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Over time.  Just from ordinary use,
                    our cells lose their elasticity and
                    start to fray.  That's one theory as
                    to why we age.

                                      PRAEGER
                    And telomorase...

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Builds the plastic tips which protect
                    the ends of shoelaces.  So long as
                    you have that, your cells keep
                      reproducing.  Now, cancer cells have
                    the unlimited capacity to keep going
                    until their source of nutrition, the
                    tissues they attack, is gone.

                                      PRAEGER
                    So the Schullmans' entire system
                    works like a cancer.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 40.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Yes.  You know what this means?  If
                    we can replicate the Schullmans'
                      biochemistry, we can stop all
                      degenerative diseases associated
                    with aging.  We could live forever.

                                      PRAEGER
                    But on what exactly?

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    I didn't want to do it, but I got
                    hungry.

                                    AXON
                          (re: Franco)
                    We can carry him.

                                      COOPER
                    Not a good idea until Hendricks checks
                    him out.  I'll be okay with Sophie. 
                    Sophie and I are friends, right?

      Sophie stands silently, watching them.

                                    AXON
                    Okay.

      Axon carefully sidles by Sophie and is out the door.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 42.

      Sophie takes a few steps closer to Cooper and...

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. H.L. STEPHENSON & SONS: TANNERY - NIGHT

      Axon runs through the deserted complex towards the mobile
      lab.  He thinks he HEARS SOMETHING over on his right.

      He's grabbed from his left and pulled into the shadows...

                                    AXON
                    No!

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. MOBILE LAB: SCIENCE POD - NIGHT

      Praeger and Hendricks.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    The Schullman cells replicate the
                    way a cancer would.  They would
                    require massive amounts of iron to
                    stay alive.  Liver, other internal
                    organs.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I'm betting they order their steaks
                    raw.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    The Schullmans -- or people like
                    them -- may actually be the factual
                    basis for the vampire myth.

                                      PRAEGER
                    So the Stephensons locked the gate
                    not to keep the world out, but to
                    keep something in.

      With a BHHHHHHJH the lights dim down to emergency level.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    What was that?

      Praeger checks the machinery and control consoles.

                                      PRAEGER
                    We're on auxiliary.  Someone must
                    have pulled out the cab's battery.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Who would do that?                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 43.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I don't know.  Maybe the Schullmans.

      Josef Schullman's eyes pierce through the semi-light.

                                      JOSEF
                    Why not, Sir?  Simply because I choose
                    not to use electricity or modern
                      conveniences does not mean I do not
                      understand them or their use.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    What do you want?

                                      JOSEF
                    Our lives returned.  But with
                      Stephenson dead and you here that
                    does not seem possible.

      Josef steps into the light.  He is flanked by two of his
      COUSINS.  They are not armed.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    We will take what we need and be
                    off.  I cannot vouch for the behaviour
                    of all my family.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Who can?

                                      HENDRICKS
                    We know how you survived this long.

      In the background, the cousins empty out Hendricks' medical
      cabinets.

                                      JOSEF
                    Do you?  I really do not think so. 
                    You cannot know what it is like to
                    be reviled and hunted.  For never
                    aging, for having hungers so acute
                    that you need to slaughter animals
                    for their blood alone.  For being
                      different.

      Praeger grabs the shotgun.

      Josef shakes his head sadly.  Holds out in his hand the
      shotgun shells.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    She fired both barrels.

      A THIRD COUSIN circles behind Praeger and Hendricks.  They
      are boxed in.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 44.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    Then we came to the New World and
                    thought we would be left alone.  But
                    it was the same.

      The Third Cousin edges closer.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    Until the Stephensons offered us a
                    shelter of sorts.

      The Third Cousin launches at Praeger.  Praeger grabs a fire
        extinguisher off the wall.  Clouts the Third Cousin.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    NO!

      The Third Cousin falls to his knees.  Praeger sprays him
      with the extinguisher.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Get him under control.

                                      JOSEF
                    Over here.

      The Third Cousin, partially blinded, staggers past Hendricks
      and Praeger to Josef.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    He wasn't thinking.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Guess not.  Why are you doing this?

                                      JOSEF
                    Don't you think we deserve to survive?

                                      PRAEGER
                    Not at any cost.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    We can help you.

                                      JOSEF
                    Maybe you can.

      OFF Josef moving towards them --

                    You smell good.

                                    AXON
                    There's a man in that building there. 
                    He's been hurt.

                                      ELENA
                    Josef wants us to leave, but I won't. 
                    Not without you.

                                    AXON
                    We have to get him help.

                                      ELENA
                    You can come with us.

                                    AXON
                    Are you listening to me?

                                      ELENA
                    Yes.

                                    AXON
                    I have to get a doctor.

                                      ELENA
                    Don't you worry about him.  He's
                    nothing - just a boy.

      Axon pushes her away from him.

                                      ELENA (CONT'D)
                    Come to me, Peter.  Don't push me
                    away.  Kiss me.  Please.

                    I'm hungry, Doctor Cooper.  We're
                    going on a long trip.  And I'm hungry.

      Sophie approaches them.  Franco whimpers.

                                      COOPER
                    What will happen to the pigeons?

                    We will have to eat them, I suppose.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 46.

                                      COOPER
                    You know, I was thinking about Clara
                    and the others.  Maybe they would
                    like to fly again.  Maybe they want
                    to be on their own.  You could release
                    them, Sophie.  They would have a
                    chance.

                                      SOPHIE
                    But I'm so hungry.

      Sophie stares at the pigeon coop.

      Cooper takes the opportunity to gather Franco up.

                    Step away.

                                    AXON

                    You heard me.

                                    AXON
                    It's fine.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL

      Ray circling towards Elena and Axon, gun extended.

                                    RAY
                    Ma'am, step away from him.

                          (husky)
                    No.

      Axon steps back two or three paces.

                                    AXON
                    Put the gun down, Ray.

                    Damn you're dense.

                                      ELENA
                    I need you!  NOW!

      With a guttural ROAR, Elena launches herself at Axon.

      She has a knife.  It glints in the moonlight.

      BAM!

      Elena is hit.  She slides from Axon's arms.

                                    AXON
                    What, what the hell did you do?

                                    RAY
                    I did you a favour.

      Ray turns Elena over and reveals to Axon that she had a 
      knife in her hand.

                                    AXON
                    We have to get her to a hospital.

                    Matt, she was attacking Axon.

                                      JOSEF
                    I tried to warn you.

                                    RAY
                    We're getting out of here.  Where's

                                      JOSEF
                    Go.  I won't be able to hold my family
                    back for long.  They will hold you
                      responsible for this.

                                    AXON
                    This way.

      He picks up Elena.

                    Yes, of course.

                    We must travel light.

                    There have been many claims, most
                    notably in Soviet Georgia, indicating
                      communities of people with remarkable
                      longevity.  Are these claims true,
                    or merely a reflection of our own
                    desires for a chance at immortality?
