      INT. 27TH FLOOR - CARY S OFFICE - DAY22

      Alicia.  She enters Cary s office, late, rushing...

                                  CARY
                    Here she is.  Alicia-- Marne Compton.  

      MARNE (26), young, intense, ready to conquer the world.  

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    Bowdoin, 2005.  Summa cum laude.  She 
                    worked for 3 years at Kaplan & Cohick.  
                    Personal assistant to Mr. Cohick.

      Alicia nods, impressed, sits, scans the resume: 

                                  ALICIA
                    Three years?  Why d you leave?

                                  MARNE
                    There was an opportunity with 
                    Habitat for Humanity.  Building an 
                    orphanage in Tijuana.

                                  CARY
                          (points to himself)
                    Peace Corps.  Belize.

      Cary, Marne share a chuckle.  Alicia studies Marne whose eye-
      contact starts with Alicia, then after four words pans to Cary.

                                  ALICIA
                    And you know we only have money for 
                    one assistant, Marne?  We ll need 
                    to share you?  

                                  MARNE
                    Oh, yes.  Don t worry... 
                          (eye contact moves to Cary)
                    ...I m used to high-pressured 
                      environments.  I like action. 

      Cary grins: loves that answer, as Alicia, um, feeling a bit 
      invisible, scrapes her chair closer to get in Cary s eye-line.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And you think you can work for both of 
                    us-- equally?

                                  MARNE
                    Oh, definitely.  To me...
                          (back to Cary like true north)
                    ...it s all about time management.

                                  MARNE (CONT'D)
                    I know you re juggling three or four 
                    cases at once.  And it s my job to 
                    help catch any balls that get dropped.  

      Cary grins, as Alicia s cellphone buzzes.  She glances at the  
    IM:  45 seconds. Alicia gets up, makes one last attempt:

                                  ALICIA
                    I love your boots, Marne.  Where dyou 
                    get them?

                                  MARNE
                    Why thank you.
                          (back to Cary)
                    I got them at Saks Fifth Avenue.  They 
                    have a sale now, and you can t believe 
                    the options--

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - BULLPEN - DAY33

      Alicia rushes out the door, grabs a piece of blank paper from 
      a secretary station, folds it in half-- we don t know why-- 
    as Cary rushes out after her, follows her toward the stairs:

                                  CARY
                    Isn t she great?

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh, yes.   

                                  CARY
                    So should I make it happen?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Well, actually, let s look at a few 
                    more people.  I ll make some calls.

                                  CARY
                          (disappointed)
                    Sure, but we should do this like 
                    voir dire or something.  Have three 
                    peremptory challenges, you know.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - HALL - DAY44

      Alicia and Cary come off the stairs onto the executive floor.

                                  CARY
                    Hey, you hear about the rumors: 
                    Stern is retiring.

                                  ALICIA
                    Stern?  Our Stern?  

                                  CARY
                    Yeah.  We ll just be Lockhart, 
                    Gardner.

                                  CARY (CONT'D)
                    I saw this happen at my dad s firm: 
                    two partners losing a third.  It was 
                    like  Dawn of the Dead .  People 
                    fighting over turf.  Junior Associates 
                    lining up against each other.

                                  ALICIA
                    But not us?

                                  CARY
                    Hey, I won t if you won t.  We have 
                    such a good working relationship.

      They arrive at the conference room.  Inside, we see Will 
      arguing with another lawyer, surrounded by trial exhibits.  

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    Wow, you re still on the Lakeshore 
                    Crash.  I thought we settled that 
                    already.  

                                  ALICIA
                          (smiles at his undercutting)
                    Nope.  Today.

    And we follow Alicia into...

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY55

      ...the large room, where the opposing lawyer points toward 
    one of Will s exhibits.  The wreckage of a train crash. 

                                  NYHOLM
                    That s our train.  It crashed.  
                    Your clients crashed it.  Do I have 
                    to use simpler sentences?

                                  WILL
                    Yes, please, I love it when you 
                    patronize me, Patti.

      PATRICIA NYHOLM (38).  Professional, put-together, 
      sophisticated, sexy, and eight-months pregnant.  Always has a 
      Mona Lisa smile for Will.  History there.  Behind her sits... 
    her assistant, COURTNEY WELLS (25), African-American.  
      Stylish. 

                                  NYHOLM
                    Cross National Freight entrusted your 
                    clients to drive our train.  They drove 
                    it too fast.  They derailed it-- 
                    causing millions in damage.  Luckily it 
                    was a freight train and nobody died--

                                  WILL
                    --except for our clients--



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #104    "Crash"    YELLOW COLLATED    9/8/09        4.
      CONTINUED:55


                                  NYHOLM
                    --We should be suing you instead of 
                    you us.   

      Alicia places the folded piece of paper beside Will, but he 
      ignores it for a moment, jumping up to point at another 
      exhibit of enlarged time cards:

                                  WILL 
                    Yes, except for this nagging little 
                    problem, Patti.  Your company 
                    overworked my clients with double-
                    shifts and 18 hour days--

                                  NYHOLM
                    Oh, yes, the sexy overtime evidence.  
                    Juries love that.  

      Will points to another exhibit: three photos of engineers.

                                  WILL
                    Except for the fact that my clients 
                    are heroes.  Except for--

    But Will is distracted, seeing through the glass Diane 
      talking with a casually distinguished lawyer, MALCOLM OVERBY 
      (55).  Alicia follows his gaze, sees him too.  

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yes?

                                  WILL
                    Except for the fact that these three 
                    men--

                                  NYHOLM
                     Heroes  you called them--

                                  WILL
                    --stayed with your train to keep it 
                    from crashing into a residential 
                      neighborhood, saving untold lives.

                                  NYHOLM
                     Untold?   Yes, love  untold. 

                                  WILL
                    My bet is a jury will too. 

                                  NYHOLM
                    Oh, Will.  We re not picking a jury 
                    tomorrow.  Judge Parks is a pro-business 
                    constructionist who detests nuisance 
                    suits as much as I do.  He s going to 
                    grant my motion to dismiss, and you know 
                    it.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #104    "Crash"    YELLOW COLLATED    9/8/09        5.
      CONTINUED: (2)55


      Will pauses.  Clearly true.  He has a bad hand.   

                                  NYHOLM (CONT D)
                    And I know you know it.   So what 
                    do you want?

                                  WILL
                    Make an offer.  

      Nyholm laughs-- finally honesty.  She gets up, stretches, her 
      pregnancy making her uncomfortable in a chair, as Will finally 
      looks at the folded paper.  Sees it s blank.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Dammit, Alicia, I thought I said 3 
                    o clock.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sorry.

      Nyholm smiles, eyes this little stageplay...

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yes, it s fun to watch you, Will.  
                    Like Shakespeare in the Park. 

                                  WILL
                    Well, this is awkward, Patti.  I 
                    tried to schedule it so you 
                    wouldn t cross paths, but-- 

      Will nods through the glass toward an assistant passing by 
      with three somber-looking WOMEN, ranging in age from 20 s to 
      mid-30 s.  The widows.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Oh, yes, heart-strings-- ouch,  
                    ouch-- being tugged.

    One of the widows looks in, makes eye contact with Alicia.  
      LINDA UNDERWOOD (35).  African-American, trying to maintain a 
      Jackie O. reserve in the face of tragedy.  

                                  WILL
                    What time is their interview with 
                     60 Minutes ?

                    to high-powered executives, and how 
                    they hate grieving widows.  Maybe 
                    you should just roll the dice. 

      Nyholm stares at Will.  Nods.  Okay: good point.  She turns 
    to Courtney, who quickly hits speed dial on an iPhone, hands 
    it to Nyholm.  Into the cell...

                    Mr. Harkin, I m putting you on speaker.

    She sets the iPhone in the middle of the table.  To Will:

                                  NYHOLM (CONT D)
                    Even though it is my belief we 
                    could win a countersuit against 
                    your clients for negligence, we are 
                    willing to pay out their pension 
                    for ten years.

                                  WILL
                    Ten--?!  Are you kidding?  Do they get 
                    double coupons with that?

                                  NYHOLM
                    Are you comfortable with that, Mr.

                    80 cents on the dollar. 

      Alicia is appalled, staring at the phone, the tiny voice.

                                  ALICIA
                    You know, their widows are having 
                    trouble paying their rent, sir.  
                    One is losing her house-- she has 
                    three children.

      Will looks toward Alicia.  Doesn t mind this bit of heart. 
    But Nyholm quickly takes him off speaker, shoots Will a look:

                                  NYHOLM
                    I ll get him up to a dollar.  You

                    After that, the offer s dead.

      Will pushes out the door, Alicia with him...

      DIANE returning to her office, the three walking together.

                    Will they take it?

      They both look to Alicia.  Clearly the one who knows.  She 
      looks toward the three widows...

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t know.  I don t think so.

      Will nods, but stops Diane before she can start off. 

                                  WILL
                    What was that about?  With Overby?

                    an old friend.  Just catching up.

    And Diane continues off.  Will pauses only a second: not sure 
      about that.  And...

    The widows.  They sit in Will s glass office.  Letters, 
      records, pay stubs spread out on the table in front of them.  
      Will and Alicia listening.  Strong, not angry: past anger:

                    They worked my husband-- ourhusbands-- 
                    to death; they tried to blame them for 
                    this accident; and now they want to pay

                                  LINDA UNDERWOOD
                    Then they must not be very sorry.

                    I think we should take it.

      They all look toward ROSE NERICH (29), a pale realist.

                    And look at these bills.  They re 
                    not even paying John s overtime.

      TERESA REYES (23), working class Hispanic.  Will stands to 
      leave.  Alicia does too, but Will shakes his head: stay.

                    Let me talk to her again, see what they

                    know we re in the end game here. 

                                  LINDA UNDERWOOD
                    You lost faith.

                                  WILL
                    No, Mrs. Underwood.  I believeCross 
                    National Freight overworked your 
                    husbands to the point of exhaustion.  I 
                      believethat s why the train crashed.  
                    But we haven t been able to prove it.  
                    And they canprove the train was going 
                    too fast.  

      Will goes.  Alicia frowns: pretty harsh.

    But Alicia pauses, stares at the letter Teresa slid toward 
      her.  Turns it around.  Looks at the stack of eight names

    But Alicia, running her finger down a memo, stops.  Looks up.

      Alicia points to the CCs at the bottom.  Clearly one is 
      longer.  Three added names at the bottom.  Will looks up.

                    Your Honor, no one has been denied

    But she pauses, raises her hand-- her pregnancy-- a  spasm.   
      Will rolls his eyes: oh come on.  There, it s past.

                    I m sorry, but I find Mr. Gardner s

                    Mr. Gardner, how long would it take to 
                    depose these witnesses?

      Nyholm frowns as Will jumps up-- a new lease on life.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    You have three days--

                    Now you have two days.  Want to try 
                    for one?

      Will starts to open his mouth, stops.  Sits:

                    No, your honor, thank you.

                    If I could interject, your honor.  
                    These executives are busy people; even 
                    two hours out of their work day can--

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Miss Nyholm, you just gave Mr. 
                    Gardner back his third day.  Would 
                    you like to give him a fourth?  

      Nyholm opens her mouth to object, stops, then...

                                  NYHOLM
                    No, your honor.  I ll stop.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Good.  We will return here on 
                    Friday to decide whether a 
                    dismissal is in order.  Does 
                    anybody have anything to say?

      Will and Nyholm shake their heads quickly.  

                                  JUDGE PARKS (CONT D)
                    Okay, next case.

      Other lawyers approach as Will whispers to Alicia:

                                  WILL
                    Cancel everything.  For the next seventy-

      Alicia collects papers from her office, on her cell:

                    Jackie, it ll just have to wait 
                    until next week.

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY1414

      ...JACKIE in the kitchen washing wine out of an apron.  

                                  JACKIE
                    But Peter is expecting them.  For his 
                    birthday.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Just explain that I ll bring Zach 
                    and Grace next time.  He ll 
                      understand.  Their first visit is a 
                    big thing.  I want to do it right.   

                                  JACKIE
                    And so you need me to stay for-- 
                    how many nights?    

                                  ALICIA
                    Three.  I shouldn t be too late.  
                    Eleven or so.  

                                  JACKIE
                    What do you want me to tell Zach and 
                    Grace?

      Alicia slows, knowing Jackie says this to hurt her, but it 
      doesn t hurt any less.  She exits her office, starting toward 
    the stairs...

                                  ALICIA
                    Tell them I ll phone tonight.  Tell 
                    them I love them.

                                  JACKIE
                    And Peter, what do I tell him?

                                  ALICIA
                    Jackie...

                                  JACKIE
                    Okay, then.  Good bye.

    And Jackie hangs up.  We stay with her a second in the 
      silence of the kitchen.  Sad really.  In the silence.

      Will, coming out of his office, joins Alicia, starts toward 
      reception... 

                                  WILL
                    Okay, so the goal is this.  I ll 
                    depose Merriman-- he s the VP of 
                      Operations.  I think that s who 
                    Patti s hiding from us.  The other 
                    two-- what s their names?

                                  ALICIA
                          (checks a document)
                    Jonathan Eldredge and Sarah Conley.  
                    He s a systems engineer.  She s in 
                    industry relations.

                                  WILL
                    Find out what you can, but whatever 
                    you do, keep those depos going.  
                    Just keep asking questions so Judge 
                    Parks doesn t pull the plug on 
                    this.  Hopefully, I draw enough 
                    blood with Merriman, they ll up 
                    their offer.  Remember the point 
                    isn t to get back to court; the 
                    point is to convince them to open 
                    their wallet further--

      They come around the corner into...

                    And you re a Mechanical Systems 
                    Manager, is that correct, Mr. 
                    Eldredge?

      JONATHAN ELDREDGE (36), abrupt and blandly handsome.  A key-
      card necklace around his neck.  Being deposed in the small 
      downstairs conference room.

                                  ELDREDGE
                    Yes.  

      Five people in the room: Alicia, Eldredge, Eldredge s Lawyer, 
    the always silent Courtney, and a COURT REPORTER.  

                                  ALICIA
                          (a document)
                    This says you ordered a new public 
                    address system for passenger cars, 
                    Mr. Eldredge.  Could you explain?

                                  ELDREDGE
                    Standard upgrade.

      That s it.  Okay.  Alicia turns to another document:

                                  ALICIA
                    And this says you authorized a new 
                    coupling mechanism, is that right?

                                  ELDREDGE
                    Yes.  Standard upgrade.

                                  ALICIA
                    And this one says... let s see, you 
                    replaced the Automated LRS, the Load 
                    Regulator System?

                                  ELDREDGE
                    Standard upgrade.  

                                  ALICIA
                    So that was a standard kind of 
                    upgrade?  Not an unusual upgrade, 
                    just a standard one?  

      Eldredge and Courtney look up.  Not in the mood for humor.

                                  ELDREDGE
                    Yes.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY1919

      ...Will questions DAVID MERRIMAN in the much larger 
      conference room.  50 s, imperious, sitting unhappily for a 
      deposition: 

                                  WILL
                    So, Mr. Merriman, I-- first of all, 
                    are you comfortable?

                                  NYHOLM
                    For the record, Mr. Merriman looks 
                    very comfortable.  And Mr. Gardner 
                    looks... verydesperate.

      Will smiles at Patti-- master tacticians-- as she stands in a 
      corner, her pregnancy making heruncomfortable.

                                  WILL
                    So, Mr. Merriman, your rail traffic 
                    has doubled in the last decade, but 
                    you ve cut your crews in half?  

                                  MERRIMAN
                    There s more automated equipment 
                    now.  Trains are easier to drive.

                                  WILL
                    And yet it still takes the same amount 
                    of time to drive them.  
                          (Merriman shrugs)
                    Let the record reflect that Mr. 
                    Merriman shrugged.  

                                  NYHOLM
                    Let the record reflect, I shrugged 
                    too.

                                  WILL
                    These men routinely worked 18 hour 
                    shifts, Mr. Merriman.  So tell me: How 
                    many hours do your train operators get 
                    off between shifts?

                                  MERRIMAN
                    Federal law requires 8 hours.  That s 
                    what we give them.  

                                  WILL
                    Even though they re forced to be on 
                    for 18 hours again?  Sometimes for 
                    eight, ten days straight.

                    clients who lost their husbands -- 
                    must have been a Freudian slip.

      Sarah looks away.  Nyholm s assistant, Courtney, hides an

                    So the truth is, these three employees 
                    had gone 24 hours without rest when 
                    this accident occurred--

                                  MERRIMAN
                    No, they worked hard, sure, but--!

                                  WILL
                    You worked them hard, didn t you?

                                  MERRIMAN
                    I did my job, Mr. Gardner!

                    Okay, let s pull this back--

                                  WILL
                    And what was your job?!  Tell us--!

                                  MERRIMAN
                    We pay these people well-- we expect 
                    results.  You re a lawyer -- do you 
                    work people hard at your firm?!  You 
                    bet your ass you do-- this is 
                    America.  You work hard and get the 
                    job done, whatever it takes!  

      A beat, as Merriman composes himself again.  Will stifles a 
      grin, glances at Nyholm, who taps a pen against the table.

                                  NYHOLM
                    I think we should take a break.  

                                  WILL
                      Definitely.   Let Mr. Merriman 
                    recompose himself.  

      Nyholm frowns at Will who grins happily.  And...THE GOOD WIFE #104    "Crash"    YELLOW COLLATED    9/8/09        18A.

    An excited Will, laughing, tossing a baseball up and down.

                    I know more about trains than I ever 
                    wanted.  And Mrs. Conley has forgotten 
                    more about her job than I ll ever know

                    better the offer.  If she does, can we

                    Linda said she d stay by the phone.

                    Thanks.  You kept them together.  I 
                    know it wasn t easy.

                                  ALICIA
                    I didn t do anything.

                    We gotta toughen you up, Alicia.  
                    You re too good a person.  We ve gotta 
                    work on that.

      Alicia smiles, picks up the remote control, throws it at him.  
      Will laughs, as BEHIND HIM -- Alicia sees Nyholm approaching.

                    You could just tell us the number.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yes, but this wasn t the company s.  
                    It was part of Underwood s 
                      application to renew his health 
                    insurance, a week before the crash.  
                    It was never processed-- until now.

      Alicia reads over Will s shoulder, in disbelief:

                                  ALICIA
                      Amphetamines?

                    That s right.  Your client was on 
                    speed.  Want to keep rolling the 
                    dice on two more days of 
                    depositions?  Because this can get 
                    rougher.

      Malcolm Overby.  The John Slattery lawyer.  At a podium-- 
       CHICAGO TRIAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION -- giving a CLElecture to 
      a group of LAWYERS.  Impressive.  Clarence Darrow reborn.  

                                  OVERBY
                    ...why?  Because we re trial lawyers.  
                    We re always looking for an edge with

    But our attention is focused on the back of the room, where 
      Kalinda, playing innocent, whispers with a very interested

                    So you work with him?

                    It s me.  Cross National is throwing 
                    an insurance drug test at us, for 
                    Underwood.  Can you check it out?

                    I-- why?  What s up?

      Kalinda pauses, decides-- what the hell?  Intentionally stilted:

                                  KALINDA
                    Diane asked me to do further work

                    She--?  What?  

    But Kalinda hears applause, sees Overby, finished, starting 
    out of the meeting room.

                                  KALINDA
                    Gotta go.

      Kalinda hangs up.  Alicia pauses, knows she was just told 
      something, but not sure what.  She sees Linda tending to a 
      track-side memorial: three small CROSSES, three framed 
      photographs.  Flowers in the fence.  Seeing her approach:

                    For the longest time I didn t think

      Will starts to say something when... the phone RINGS.  
      Startling them both.  Will jumps up, answers.

    He listens, then hands the phone to a confused Alicia.  

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - RECEPTION - NIGHT2929

      Alicia turns into reception to find a nervous woman standing 
    at the elevator door, holding it open.  Sarah Conley.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Mrs. Conley?  Did you forget

    Oh, Alicia steps closer.  As the elevator keeps bumping 
      Sarah s hand, irritated at being held open.  Alicia gestures 
    her in.

                                  ALICIA
                    Come on.  Let s talk.

                                  SARAH
                    No.  It s wrong what they re doing.
                    Blaming them with that drug test.  
                    Blaming them for something they...
                          (stops herself)

                                  ALICIA
                    Something they...?  

      Sarah looks at Alicia, shakes her head.  Can t, won t say.

                                  SARAH
                    Newbury Heights.

      Sarah retreats into the elevator.

                                  ALICIA
                    Wait, what?  

                                  SARAH

      EXT.  SUBURBAN CHICAGO HOUSE - DAY (EARLY MORNING)3030

      A baby laughing.  Three months old.  In an infant swing on the 
      front lawn of a pretty suburban house.  Sarah Conley hides her 
      eyes again, then-- surprise.  The baby laughs.

                                  ALICIA
                    How old?  

      Sarah turns to see Alicia approaching.  Frowns, to herself:

                                  SARAH
                    I m so stupid.  I should ve just shut 
                    up.  I should ve just... kept walking.

                                  ALICIA
                    But that would ve been wrong.  

                                  SARAH
                    I thought you d be different.  I 
                    thought after what you went through-- 
                    with your family-- 
                          (the worst part)
                    And you come here?  To my house?  

      Alicia nods.  She s right.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sorry.

                                  SARAH
                    Then go.

                                  ALICIA
                    I can t.  There are three mothers who 
                    are widows now, Mrs. Conley--

                                  SARAH
                    That is not my fault!

                                  ALICIA
                    But it s somebody sfault.

      Sarah is silent.  Looks at her son.  Frowns.

                                  SARAH
                    What do you want?

      Alicia eyes her.  Nods.  Empathizing:

                                  ALICIA
                    I looked into Newbury Heights.  I

                    I ve gone back fifty years.  
                    There s never been an accident 
                    there. 

                                  SARAH
                    Because it wasn t one. 

      Alicia takes out a pen and notepad.  Sarah frowns at this.  
    It all becomes more real with a pen and pad.

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    I watched you on TV.  I liked you.  
                    Standing there like that.  When 
                    people would say you knew about it, 
                    about the prostitutes-- I d defend 
                    you.  I d say they re in love.  
                    That s why she s doing it.  

      Alicia studies her.  Doesn t want to correct her.  Waits.  

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    It wasn t an accident; it was a 
                    near-miss.  And it wasn t one of 
                    our trains.

                    Coming into Newbury Heights,
                    there s a nine degree curve.

      Alicia strains to hear over the noise: ALTON HOOD (40), the *
      quietly professional African-American engineer.  Yelling:*

                    That s where we jumped the track. 
                    Just managed to get the brake on 
                    before we hit the commuter train.

      Alicia nods, cups her hand to his ear...

                                  ALICIA
                    Did your company ever identify the
                    problem?

                                  HOOD
                    Sure -- they identified me.  Said I 
                    was going too fast.  Put a 
                    disciplinary notice in my file.  
                    But the speed gauge never went 
                    above 32 m.p.h.  I thought it was 
                      mechanical.  Maybe a faulty 
                    pressure sensor--

      Hood stares at her: Um, how did you know that?

                    Trains, you know.  Love trains.  If 
                    you upgraded the LRS, you d be 
                    replacing the pressure sensor too, 
                    right?

                                  HOOD
                    Yeah.  Fact that s what they did, 
                    after the near-miss: they upgraded 
                    the LRS.

                    Did anyone from any other company know

      EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY3636

      ...Malcolm Overby, leaving his elegant residence, picks up 
    the Chicago-Tribunefrom his stoop, flops it open, starts 
      toward his car, reading, watched by...

      ...a nonchalant Kalinda.  Parked in her car.  She s good at her 
      job, never seeming like she s following you as she s following 
      you.  She watches, as...  

      ...HONK-- a perky car honk comes from a parked luxury Buick
    up the street.  He smiles, starts toward it.  A friend?  A 
      workmate?

      Kalinda gets out of her car, starts in that direction, 
      crossing the street.  She pauses at another car door, 
      pretends to be looking for her keys.  Eyes Overby in a car 
      mirror, seeing...

      ...him lean down, kiss the driver in the other car.  

      Interesting.  Kalinda, her back to the scene, unzips her coat, 
      slips out her CAMERA, tucks the long telephoto lens under her 
      arm, pointing it inconspicuously back toward Overby.  She peers 
      down at the camera s fold-out LCD, zooms in on...

      ...the two kissing.  Overby s face blocking the lover.  And--

      --click-- click-- Kalinda snaps photos, waits... waits... for 
    the kiss to end.  Finally it does and Kalinda sees the person 
      being kissed is...

      ...Diane.  

    Oh shit.  Kalinda lifts her eye from the camera.  Suddenly 
      gets it.  She starts to put her camera away, when...

      Kalinda zips up her camera bag, starts away discreetly toward 
    her car-- walking, faster.  Forty feet away, she starts to 
      smile, grin, laugh.  To herself, sing-song fashion:

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY3737

      Alicia sets up the video camera again, readying for a 
      deposition when-- KLUNK-- the door bangs open.  Patti Nyholm.  
      Overloaded with a laptop case, depositions, Courtney behind 
      her, carrying the rest...  

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. Merriman s will be upstairs.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yes, I thought I d sit in on this 
                    one today.  Get to know youbetter. 

    Oh.  Alicia doesn t flinch, offers her a chair:

                                  ALICIA
                    Great.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Uh, actually, chairs aren t my friends 
                    these days.  I think I ll just stand.

      Alicia nods, starts to unpack documents.  Patti eyes her.

                                  NYHOLM (CONT D)
                    So you re Will s new one?

      Alicia.  She keeps working, strategically deciding to 
      interpret it casually:

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.  I m his new Junior Associate.

                                  NYHOLM
                          (grins)
                    Yep, that s what I meant.  The way 
                    he looks at you: that s what I 
                    meant.

      Alicia peers up at a grinning Nyholm.  Then turns back to 
      unpacking.  Courtney acts like she s not there.

                                  NYHOLM (CONT D)
                    I guess he finds you a challenge.  
                    Too many blonde gigglers, and why 
                    not go for someone more substantial, 
                    someone with an interesting history--

                                  ALICIA
                    Mrs. Nyholm.  I know this is how it 
                    works: we try to get into each other s 
                    head, unnerve each other.

                    But can I just offer you a little 
                    advice: After the last eight months, 
                    I m vaccinated.  

      Nyholm stares at her.  Nods.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Fair enough.  Let s get started.

                                                                    CUT TO LATER:

      Alicia re-deposes Jonathan Eldredge.  Nyholm stands, taking 
      notes.  Courtney sits in a corner.

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. Eldredge, two months before the 
                    Lakeshore Crash, you authorized an 
                    upgrade of the Load Regulator 
                    System on all Cross National 
                    Freight trains.  Can you explain 
                    why?

                                  ELDREDGE
                    There was no one reason.  It s a 
                    change we d planned for some time.  

      Alicia s cellphone ring-- Twilight Zone-- Jackie s ringtone--  
      Alicia quickly grabs it-- shuts it off.  Nyholm smiles:

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yes, I know the feeling.

                                  ALICIA
                    And what about the LRS in the train that 
                    crashed, did you replace that one?

                                  ELDREDGE
                    I don t believe we did.  The upgrade 
                    takes time-- we can t have all our 
                    engines out of commission at once.

                                  ALICIA
                      I understand.  Tell me about 
                    Newbury Heights, Mr. Eldredge?

      Eldredge stops.  

                                  ELDREDGE
                    What?

                                  ALICIA
                    Newbury Heights, tell me about it.

                                  ELDREDGE
                    It s uh...  I don t know what you mean.

      Nyholm glances up.  She s not sure what it means, but she 
      doesn t like how it throws him.   

                                  ALICIA
                    On June 21st, you went to Newbury 
                    Heights to check out a near-miss 
                    collision, isn t that right?  

      Eldredge.  Really nervous now.  Nyholm seeing this.  To him:

                                  NYHOLM
                    Would you like to take a break?  

                                  ALICIA
                    If you were to learn there was a 
                    problem with a piece of equipment 
                    on your trains, Mr. Eldredge, you d 
                    replace the part, wouldn t you?

                                  ELDREDGE
                    Of course I would...

                                  ALICIA
                    And you d make sure no trains were 
                    operating with unsafe equipment?

                                  ELDREDGE
                    Look, I know what you re thinking--

                                  NYHOLM
                          (trying to stop him)
                    No, you don t. 

                                  ELDREDGE
                    --But I never once--

      Arghhhh!Nyholm grabs her stomach.  Immense pain.  As Alicia  
      rolls here eyes.

                                  NYHOLM
                    My apologies.  A pang.  We ll have 
                    to break this off.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh, come on!  Objection.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Let the record reflect: deposition 
                    suspended for medical reasons.  And 
                    again, I apologize.  Mr. Eldredge!

    And they start out the door as Alicia stands.  Dammit.  

                                  COURTNEY
                    Sorry.

    Oh.  Alicia turns, forgot Nyholm s assistant, Courtney. 

                                  ALICIA
                    It s okay.

                                  COURTNEY
                    The law, it s... a funny thing.

      Alicia eyes her: something genuine there.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, it is.

      Courtney picks up her purse and briefcase and rushes out as 
      Alicia eyes the door for a second.  Then looks toward her 
      cellphone, sees a voicemail.  Alicia dials--

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)

    And we find...

      INT. TAMMSMINIMUM SECURITY PRISON - PROCESSING - INTERCUT3838

      ...Jackie s cellphone.  It rests in a bin next to a metal 
      detector, along with two others.  A GUARD picks up the bin, *
      slides it onto a shelf next to dozens more just like it.*

      INT. TAMMSMINIMUM SECURITY PRISON - VISITING ROOM - DAY3939

      PETER.  He waits.  Sitting at a visiting room table, foot 
      tapping nervously.  He looks over toward... another white 
      collar prisoner hugging his visiting family.  His kid.

      Peter swallows.  He s vulnerable and likable this way.

                                  ZACH (O.S.)
                    Dad.

      Peter closes his eyes-- that word, it pushes his heart up 
      into his throat.  He turns, finds ZACH, looking very tall, *
      starting toward him.  Peter gets up, goes to him.  Reaches 
      out.  Hugs him tight.  Zach hugs him back.

                                  PETER 
                    I...

       --Missed you.   But he can t get it out, words caught in his

                                  ZACH
                    I know.

      Peter looks over Zach s shoulder, sees...

      ...GRACE, turning a corner, pausing, with Jackie.  Grace isn t *
      sure why, but she unconsciously reaches out, takes Jackie s 
      hand.  A little girl.  Jackie leans slightly, whispers to her:

                                  JACKIE
                    Go to him.  

      Grace.  She looks at Peter s clothes.  A blue prison outfit.  
      Just absurd, the whole thing absurd.  She sees her brother 
      gesturing sharply at her: let s go.  

      Grace lets go of Jackie s hand.  Takes a step forward.  Then 
      another.  Peter, his eyes wet, reaches out for her.  

    She goes to him and Peter slips down to one knee, holds her.  
      Emotionally overwhelmed.  First time in a long time he s been 
      emotionally overwhelmed.

                                  GRACE
                    Happy Birthday, Dad.

      Peter nods, holds her tight.  Grace purses her lips to keep 
      from crying, keep from feeling too much.  Then, too quickly, 
    she pulls away again, back to the safety of Jackie.  Peter 
      stands -- meanwhile, Zach looks around, curious --

                                  ZACH
                    So are you still a fish, or what?

      This takes the edge off things.  Peter smiles, bemused, pulls 
      Zach into a dad-son headlock, scruffs his hair.

                                  PETER 
                    Yep, it s just like Oz.  

                                  ZACH

                    Zach...

      Peter chuckles: shake-downs?  He shares a look with Grace, 
    but she just looks away.  Peter looks to Jackie instead...

                                                                    CUT TO LATER:

      Zach and Grace stand at the door, about to leave.  Waiting 
    for Peter and Jackie, who walk slowly over from the table.  A 
      FEMALE GUARD smiles at Grace.  Grace smiles back.  Oddly 
      comforting.  As Jackie and Peter approach, confer, intimate:

                                  JACKIE

                          (an answering machine)
                    Your honor, Will Gardner.  This is my 
                    third message.  Defense Counsel has 
                      interrupted deposition for the day-- 
                    Dammit.

    The phone hangs up on him as Alicia gasps-- lightbulb going 
      off-- freezing the Eldredge image, stares at it.  

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    What?

      Alicia points to the image on the screen -- not Eldredge, but 
    the KEY-CARD around his neck:

                                  ALICIA
                    He said he was in the office all 
                    day.  You have to swipe that every 
                    time you enter and exit.  Which 
                    means we can tell exactly when he 
                    came and went.

    She and Will share a look: that s it.  Will glances at his 
      watch, starts out...

                                  WILL
                    I can t get the Judge on the phone, 
                    but if I hurry, I might catch him --

                                  ALICIA
                    What are you doing?

                                  WILL
                    Getting a court order for Cross 
                    National Freight s security 
                    records.  Find Kalinda-- tell her 
                    to meet me at the courthouse--

      Alicia nods, looks up, sees Kalinda in Diane s office, 
      talking with Diane, and...

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - DIANE S OFFICE - DAY4141

      ...we re in with them.  Kalinda briefing Diane, both intent 
    on not making this awkward.  And yet... it s awkward.

                          (careful)
                    ...are you sure that s what you re 
                    looking for?

                                  DIANE
                          (eyeing her)
                    I don t know.  Should I be looking 
                    for something else?

                                  KALINDA
                    Well, that s like asking a dentist 
                    whether you should brush.  

    But Kalinda pauses, seeing Alicia in the hall, pointing 
      toward her, needing her.  Kalinda shakes her head-- later.   
      Alicia moves on as Diane notices the exchange... 

                                  DIANE
                    Okay.  See what you can find out.  
                    And, Kalinda, again, this is just 
                    between you and me.  Understand?

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes.
                          (starts to leave, stops)
                    Do you know how much you pay jury 
                    consultants?

                                  DIANE
                    No.

                                  KALINDA
                    $100,000 for three months work.

                                  DIANE
                    Sounds about right.

                                  KALINDA
                    Do you know how much I make?  

                                  DIANE
                    I have a feeling I m finding out.

                                  KALINDA
                    A fourth of that.

                                  DIANE
                    That sounds outrageous.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes, it does, doesn t it?

    And Kalinda leaves.  Diane leans there.  Considers that.  

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - ALICIA S OFFICE - NIGHT4242

      Klunk-- Kalinda drops large bound print-outs on Alicia s desk.

                    Thanks.  
                          (stops her from leaving)
                    So, Kalinda, can I ask you.  This 
                    thing you re doing for Diane, does 
                    it involve Malcolm Overby?

                                  KALINDA
                    No.

                                  ALICIA
                    It doesn t?

                                  KALINDA
                    No, you can t ask me.

                                  ALICIA
                          (nods: okay)
                    It s just... if he s coming on as a 
                    third partner, Will should know.  

      Kalinda pauses, doesn t want to give the wrong impression.  

                                  KALINDA
                    You can t ask me, and I can t tell 
                    you, but don t conclude from what 
                    I m saying, it s what you think.   

                                  ALICIA
                          (ummm...)
                    Okay.  Can you be anymore specific?  

                                  KALINDA
                    No.  

    And Kalinda starts away.  Alicia watches her go, confused and 
      unsatisfied.  She looks down toward the bound print-outs, 
      and...

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - NIGHT4343

      ...flips through them, now in Will s office.  Working late.  
    The rest of the office dark.  Just the skyscraper lights 
      outside.  Will and Alicia on the couches in his sitting area, 
      flipping through print-outs:  

                                  ALICIA
                    Wait, here s the date.  June 21st.

                          (peering over her shoulder)
                    It would take him about two hours 
                    to get out to Newbury Heights. 

                                  ALICIA
                          (reading)
                    He left the office at 6:42 pm, and 
                    came back...

                                  WILL
                          (seeing it too)
                    ...an hour later.

      Damn.  They both peer at the print-out.  Disappointed.

                                  ALICIA
                    That s not enough time.

                    How about the next day?

      Alicia nods, flips the page.  Frowns.

                                  ALICIA
                    Same thing.  He leaves at 9:48 pm.  
                    Comes back at... 10:33 pm--  And...  
                          (flipping the page)
                      ...Thursday the same.  He s out for 
                    one hour.

                    No, wait, that s somebody else.  

    Oh.  Alicia runs her finger across the line of numbers:

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh, right, Sarah Conley.  
                          (moves one line up)
                    There heis.  Eldredge went out and 
                    came back... a few minutes later.

                                  WILL
                    That s... interesting.   

                                  ALICIA
                    What?

      Will flips through his book.  

                                  WILL
                    Look, here it is again.  Sarah

                    minutes after him--

      Alicia and Will pause, look up at each other.

                                  WILL
                    They re always the last two working

                    each other-- through the street 
                    exit, not the parking garage, so 
                    they re on foot.  And you know

                    They were having an affair.

                    What s the occasion?

      Does anyone knock?  Jackie at her door.  Alicia looks at her, 
      confused by the question.  Um, simply:

                                  ALICIA
                    Work.

                    Late.  You were asleep.  Thanks, by 
                    the way.  This ll be the last late

                    I took Grace and Zach to see Peter.

      Alicia.  She freezes, momentarily unsure -- did she hear 
      correctly?  But Jackie just leaves the doorway.

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING4545

      Alicia follows Jackie into kitchen.  Angry:

                    discussed this.  I was taking them 
                    next week.  

                                  JACKIE
                    It worked out perfectly, seeing him.  
                    They were perfect.

      Jackie stands hand on hip: first time in her life she knows 
      she s wrong, but can t admit it. 

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)

      Alicia charges into work.  No-nonsense.  A world of heat 
      behind her.  She sees Cary chatting up three giggly blonde 23-
      year-olds, running through their resumes.  He sees Alicia, 
      smiles, starts to point toward the applicants, but...

                                  ALICIA
                    No.

      Alicia in the study.  Sarah enters, closes the door.

                                  ALICIA
                    Jonathan Eldredge is denying everything --  

                                  SARAH
                    That s not my problem.

                                  ALICIA
                    All those nights you went to the 
                    hotel across the street with him-- 
                    includingthe night of the 
                    accident.  It isyour problem.

      Sarah.  She just stares at Alicia.  Stunned.  Alicia tries to 
      keep herself hard, but she can t in the face of this...

                                  SARAH
                    Oh my god.

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t care about your personal life, 
                    Sarah.  That s your business.  All I 
                    care about is what he said the night of 
                    the Lakeshore Crash.  That s all.

                                  SARAH
                    I-- He needed to talk.  He was so 
                    upset.  He said he knew for awhile 
                    there was a problem with the 
                    pressure sensor.  

                                  ALICIA
                    He went to Newbury Heights?

                                  SARAH
                    No, but somebody from their company 
                    told him about it.  He was trying 
                    to fix it, quietly, but...

      Sarah starts to break down with the weight of it all.  Alicia 
      dreads what she has to say, but she has to say it:

                                  ALICIA
                    Sarah, I need to demonstrate that 
                    Eldredge knew about the problem before
                    the crash.  But there s no document, 
                    no smoking gun.  And I don t have time 
                    to find one.  All I ve got is you-- 
                    your testimony.

                                  SARAH
                    I can t testify--!

                                  ALICIA
                    This isn t about the affair, Sarah.  
                    It s about the accident.

                                  SARAH
                    But the only way I know about the 
                    accident is because of the affair.  
                    And I ll have to talk about it.  If 
                    I don t, they llbring it up, 
                    they ll say I m getting back at 
                    him, that I m bitter... you know 
                    how they ll twist this around...

                                  ALICIA
                    Sarah, I have no other way.

    But just then we hear the baby crying, and the door opens, 
      BRIAN, her handsome husband, enters the room, with baby:

                                  BRIAN
                    Sorry, hon-- Dylan only wants you.
                          (looks between them)
                    Everything alright?

      Sarah nods, smiles in spite of herself, takes the baby:

                                  SARAH
                    Yes, fine.  I love you.

      Brian kisses her, leaves again.  Alicia stares at Sarah.  
      Stares at the baby. 

                                  ALICIA
                    How old did you say Dylan was?

                                  SARAH
                    Three months.

                                  ALICIA
                    The accident was a year ago...

      Sarah stares at Alicia, nods, pleading, whispering:

                    It s not just me.  It s my husband, 
                    it s my other kids, it s a baby.  They 
                    have nothing to do with this, but if 
                    you make me testify --
                          (then)
                    All that happened to you.  Your 
                    husband, your family.  Please don t do 
                    to me what somebody did to you. 

      Alicia stares at her.  And...

      ...klunk-- Alicia slams her car door.  Sits in it.  Breathes 
      deeply.  She looks toward the suburban house: for the moment, 
      a happy place.  Alicia turns away, starts the car.

      Malcolm Overby.  There he is again, at a business cocktail 
      party.  The most interesting man in the world.  Laughing, 
      mingling.  Watched by...

      ...Kalinda, in a spectacular outfit, chatting with the Third 
      Year Associate from earlier...

                                  THIRD YEAR ASSOCIATE
                    Wow, you re really obsessed with him.

                                  KALINDA
                    Not obsessed.  Intrigued.  So, is he 
                    seeing anyone?

                                  THIRD YEAR ASSOCIATE
                    So that s what this is about.  You 
                    want me to introduce you?

                                  KALINDA

      A smiling Overby.  Kalinda turns.  Oops.  In the face of her

      Overby laughs.  Likes her.  Finds her monotone, non-flirting 
      tone a challenge.

      Overby laughs.  Hears his name being called across the room.  
    He pulls out a card.  Places it on the bar in front of her.  

                                  OVERBY
                    Use it any way you want.

      Overby smiles, goes.  And... Kalinda frowns.  Shit.

                    This is everything.  Every pill in

                    this was a prescription Jimmy got a 
                    month before the accident.  For 
                    allergies.  Could that be it?

      Alicia in her apartment entryway, studies it.

                                  NYHOLM
                    As melodramatic as Mr. Gardner s 
                    account is, your honor, I think the 
                    last time I stomped out of anywhere 
                    was the third grade.  Unless I ve 
                    grown bigger than I thought.   

      Nyholm chuckles.  Judge Parks doesn t.  

                                  NYHOLM (CONT D)
                    We ask, your honor, for an open 
                      deposition, so you can rule on the 
                      admissability questions as they arise.

      Alicia.  She looks back toward Sarah Conley, pale, sitting on 
    the aisle.  Whispering to Will:

                                  ALICIA
                    They re going to force her to testify 
                    in open court?  

                                  WILL
                    If she denies the affair, they ll 
                    accuse her of perjury.  Then 
                    everything she says gets thrown out.

      Parks finally clears his throat.  Everyone shuts up.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Who are you deposing?

      Will looks to Alicia who stands, without looking back:

                                  ALICIA
                    Sarah Conley, your honor.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #104    "Crash"    YELLOW COLLATED    9/8/09        51.
      CONTINUED:5454


      Sarah stands weakly and starts toward the stand, as Eldredge 
      eyes her.  Sarah doesn t meet his gaze, takes the stand. 

      Alicia approaches her, trying to muster the strength to do 
      this.  She looks out to the gallery, sees... 

      ...Linda Underwood, standing at the back.  

      Finally, Alicia turns back to face Sarah.  As she draws 
      closer, Sarah whispers under her breath:

                                  SARAH
                    Please don t do this...

                                  ALICIA
                          (whispers back)
                    I m so sorry.

    She looks away, takes a deep breath, and then:

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Ms. Conley -- what did Mr. Jonathan 
                    Eldredge tell you on the night of 
                    August 5th, just a few hours after the 
                    Lakeshore Crash?

                                  NYHOLM
                    Objection, your honor.  No foundation.  
                    Mrs. Florrick hasn t established 
                    access.   

                                  WILL
                    Do we really need to establish access, 
                    your honor?  They work in the same 
                    company.

                                  NYHOLM
                    But in vastly different departments.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Sustained.

      Alicia frowns.  Damn.  Looks at Sarah, her eyes welling up.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Ms. Conley, where were you on the 
                    evening of August 5th after the 
                    Lakeshore Crash?  

                                  SARAH
                          (beat)
                    I was in a hotel room, downtown.

                                  ALICIA
                    And were you alone?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #104    "Crash"    YELLOW COLLATED    9/8/09        52.
      CONTINUED: (2)5454


      A long beat.  At defense table, Jonathan Eldredge swallows 
      hard, praying she won t have the strength.  But she does:

                                  SARAH
                    No.  I was with Jonathan Eldredge.

      Eldredge closes his eyes.  Damn.  

5555INT. CIVIL COURTHOUSE - LADIES ROOM - DAY 

      Alicia washes her hands, dries them.  Staring at herself in 
    the mirror -- coming to terms with what she just did.

      INT. CIVIL COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME TIME5656

      Alicia exits the ladies room and finds Sarah Conley, seated 
    on a bench.  Crying, quietly.  PASSERSBY ignore her -- 
      courthouses are often places of strong emotion.  

      Hesitantly, Alicia approaches -- Sarah Conley looks up, sees 
      her.  They share a look.  Then Sarah gets up and walks away.

5757INT. 28TH FLOOR - DIANE S OFFICE - DAY 

      Diane and Kalinda.  Back in Diane s office.  One last scene 
    to be played.  A second passes.  

                                  DIANE
                    I assume you have some information.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes.  I looked deeper into Mr. Overby, 
                    and... I don t think he s a good 
                    candidate for... partnership. 
                    Based on my investigation, he appears 
                    to be... non-exclusive.

                                  DIANE
                      Non-exclusive? 

                                  KALINDA
                    In pursuit of other options. 
                          (then)
                    Openly in pursuit.

      A beat.  Diane s hurt, though she tries to hide it:

                                  DIANE
                    You re sure?

                    Positive.  The firm can do better.

      Diane nods, taking this in.  There s an awkward beat, then --

                                  DIANE
                    Thank you, Kalinda.  For your... 
                    discretion in this matter.

                                  KALINDA
                          (starts to exit)
                    Always.

                                  DIANE
                    And Kalinda?
                          (Kalinda turns back)
                    Let s talk tomorrow about 
                      renegotiating your contract.  

                                  KALINDA
                    I would like that.

      Kalinda exits, leaving Diane alone as in the next office 
      over...

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - DAY5858

      ...Nyholm s cellphone again rests in the middle of Will s 
      table, turned to a speaker phone...

                                  NYHOLM
                    Can you hear us, Mr. Harkin?  

      Just static on the phone.  Nyholm, Will, and Alicia stare at 
    it.  Nyholm shakes it.  

                                  WILL
                    Where s your assistant?

                                  NYHOLM
                    I don t know.  She quit.  It s hard 
                    to find a good assistant these 
                    days.  Mr. Harkin, I m going to 
                    make our last and final offer now.  

      Nothing from the phone.  Nyholm shrugs, hands a sheet of 
      paper to Will.  Alicia doesn t expect one, but Nyholm crosses 
    to her.  Gives her one too.  Alicia peers up at Nyholm who 
      nods with respect.  

                                  NYHOLM (CONT D)
                    I think you can see, this meets all 
                    your demands.  And then some.  Under 
                    one condition.  We don t go to trial.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #104    "Crash"    YELLOW COLLATED    9/8/09        54.

                                  WILL
                    I think we can handle that.

                                  ALICIA
                    One other thing.  They want an 
                    apology.

      Nyholm stares at Alicia.  Even Will s surprised.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Excuse me?

    But before she can say anything more, Mr. Harkin s voice 
      comes over the speaker, cutting her off--

                                  MR. HARKIN (V.O.)
                    Fine.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Mr. Harkin?  

                                  MR. HARKIN (V.O.)
                    Just settle this thing, will you?

      Click.  We hear the phone go dead, the dial tone.  Nyholm 
      quickly shuts it off.  Will suppresses a grin, stands.  
      Alicia too.

                                  WILL
                    Well, Patti, always a pleasure.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yep.

                                  WILL
                    Until next time.

                    Mrs. Florrick.

    She nods.  And they leave.  

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - BULLPEN - DAY5959

      Alicia starts down the stairs toward her floor, unsmiling, 
    not in a triumphant mood.  She pauses, sees...

      ...Linda and the other two widows near her office.  They look 
    up, see her.  She goes to them, seeing their expectant faces.  
    And Alicia can t help it: she smiles-- who wouldn t.  They 
      smile too, thrilled.  The group breaks out in hugs, cheers.

      Cary coming up behind her.  With another resume.  Alicia 
      looks at him, reluctantly.

                                  ALICIA
                    Sure.

                                  CARY
                    Because if you don t like this one, 
                    I think we need to be looking at 
                    the new crop of Ivy Leaguers.

    And they turn into...

      INT. TAMMSMINIMUM SECURITY PRISON - VISITING ROOM - DAY6161

      Prison.  A gate klangsopen.  And... Peter enters the 
      visiting room, then stops, surprised.  It s Alicia.  She 
      looks up at him as he approaches --

                                  PETER
                    Hey.  I didn t expect you.

                                  ALICIA
                    Spur of the moment.  Sorry I missed 
                    your birthday.  The kids said the 
                    visit went well?  

                                  PETER
                          (a wide smile)
                    Yeah, they look great.  Zach s 
                    almost as tall as I am.

                    Threemonths, just suddenly, boom.  *

      They sit in pleasant silence for a second.  Peter needs to 
    say something.  Tries to sound casual:




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #104    "Crash"    YELLOW COLLATED    9/8/09        56.

                    Mom said you were working hard on a 
                    case.  I guess you and Will were 
                    putting in a lot of long hours.

      Alicia.  She looks up at Peter, shakes her head: only he 
      could go there.  

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    It s just... you get a lot of time

                    Oh, Peter.  If there s one thing 
                    I m learning out there.  Nobody is.

                                  PETER
                    Gardner acts like a good guy, like 
                      everybody s friend.  But I could 
                    tell you things. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Can we at least acknowledge how 
                    ironic this conversation is?

                                  PETER
                    I love you, Alicia.

      Alicia blinks.  A whiplash from the sudden shift.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    I ve been thinking about that old 
                    apartment on 81st.  The air 
                    conditioning unit we had.  That T-
                    shirt you d wear-- from the Mexican 
                    restaurant downstairs-- and all I 
                    could think was-- God, you were the 
                    most beautiful woman in the world.

      Alicia stares at him.  A clear memory to her too.

                                  ALICIA
                    Then?

                                  PETER
                    No, and now.  And all I could think 
                    was: I don t want to lose you.

                    I got this sickness.  This power 
                    trip--    

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh, don t blame it on that.

                                  PETER
                    You re right.  It had nothing to do 
                    with that.  It had to do with me.  
                    And I m sorry.   

      Alicia studies him.  Wants to believe him.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Please.  Don t give up on me.  

      Peter s hand reaches out, tentatively.  Alicia stares at it. 

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Please.

      Alicia thinks about it.  And we BACK OUT.
