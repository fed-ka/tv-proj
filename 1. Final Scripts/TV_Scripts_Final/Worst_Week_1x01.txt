      INT. MEL AND SAM S APARTMENT - DAY

      CARD: December 20th.

      SAM BRIGGS, 31, dressed for work, nice-looking, is standing 
      next to a closed door.  After a beat, he calls into the door:

                                  SAM
                    You okay, Mel?

                                  MEL (V.O.)
                    I m fine.

      The sound of violent VOMITING comes from behind the door.

                                  SAM
                    Yeah, you sound good.

      SFX: Toilet Flushing.

      The door opens and MELANIE COOK (MEL), comes out, wiping her 
      mouth.  Even looking a little peaked, as she does, she is 
      beautiful.  She s 30, she doesn t wear makeup.

                                  MEL
                    Wow.
                          (then)
                    Okay, are we ready?

      Sam gestures to FOUR ENORMOUS SUITCASES.

                                  MEL (CONT D)
                    Sam, we re only going to be at my 
                    parents  for five nights.

                                  SAM
                          (re: luggage)
                    Yeah, but with all the Christmas 
                    gifts, and who knows what the 
                    weather s going to be like, and I 
                    wasn t sure if there were certain 
                    meals we had to dress for--

                                  MEL
                    Am I marrying a girl?        "Worst Week"                                           2.


                                  SAM
                    Would you like to?  Because I d be 
                    open to that as long as I could be 
                    your guys  butler.

      Mel studies Sam for a beat --

                                  MEL 
                    You re nervous about seeing my 
                    parents.

                                  SAM
                    Nervous?  Why would I be nervous?
                          (then, like he s just 
                              remembering)
                    Oh, you mean because I got their 
                    daughter pregnant out of wedlock?  
                    Or because I m going to ask them 
                    for your hand in marriage armed 
                    with the knowledge that they 
                    despise me?  Nah, I m not nervous.

                                  MEL
                    They don t despise you.

                                  SAM
                    You re right.  When I burned down 
                    their house last time I saw them, I 
                    think they were fine with that.  I 
                    think they thought that was cute.

                                  MEL
                    You didn t burn it all the way 
                    down.  You only burned it partially 
                    down. And, anyhow, it s been 
                    repaired and all is forgiven...
                          (off Sam s look)
                    As long as you promise to never go 
                    near the grill again.

                                  SAM
                    I m a great griller.  

                                  MEL
                    I know, honey.  You got distracted.

                                  SAM
                    I didn t get distracted, I got 
                    attacked by a dog.        "Worst Week"                                           3.


                                  MEL
                    Texaco s a herder.  A guy he 
                    doesn t know starts grilling when 
                    the rest of the family s out, he s 
                    going to herd that guy.  It s his 
                    instinct.

                                  SAM 
                    Whose side are you on, mine or 
                    Texaco s?

                                  MEL
                    Go over the choices again.

      Mel smiles and puts her arms around Sam.

                                  MEL (CONT D)
                    I m on your side.  I m always on 
                    your side.  Even when you burn down 
                    my ancestral home.

                                  SAM
                    Partially burn down your ancestral 
                    home. Anyway, that s not going to 
                    happen this time.  This time your 
                    parents are going to meet a whole 
                    new Sam.

                                  MEL
                    Well, you know what, even though I 
                    love the old Sam unconditionally, 
                    it might be nice for my parents to 
                    see some other colors.

                                  SAM
                    How about the color of prudence and 
                    the color of responsibility?  Would 
                    those be pleasing to their eyes?

                                  MEL
                    Those are their favorite colors.

      She kisses him.  Then:

                                  MEL (CONT D)
                          (re: kiss)
                    Oh, God, was that vomit-y?

                                  SAM
                    Little bit.

      Sam starts gathering his belongings and Mel starts throwing 
      stuff in a bag.        "Worst Week"                                           4.


                                  MEL
                    You re sure you re okay taking the 
                    train out?  I really don t mind 
                    driving back tonight for you.

                                  SAM
                    I don t want you driving all that 
                    way in the dark.

      Sam crosses out of the room.

                                  MEL
                          (calling after)
                    Okay, but try to get to my parents  
                    house by nine for dessert.  My mom 
                    made her cherry pie.  I kind of 
                    promised her you d be there for it.

                                  SAM (O.C.)
                    I don t like pie.

                                  MEL
                    Sam...

      Sam crosses back in.

                                  SAM 
                    I like cake.  And so do you.  And 
                    that s why we love each other. 

      He puts his arms around her and goes in for a kiss, but then 
      she gags.  As she HURRIES off to the bathroom:

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                          (beat)
                    I m sorry, that was Old Sam 
                    talking.  I ll be there for pie...!


      INT. CAP WEEKLY MAGAZINE - NIGHT

      Cap Weekly is Washington s version of Entertainment Weekly.  
      It s a light current events magazine, where Sam works as a 
      writer and editor.  They re having their annual Holiday Party 
      in the large, modern lobby.  Loud music, drunk people.  Sam s 
      standing with his best friend and co-worker, ADAM GREEN, 30.  
      Adam s scruffy and seems not to be enjoying himself.

                                  SAM
                    This is nice.

                                  ADAM
                    It s awful.  You know what would be 
                    nice?

                                  ADAM (CONT'D)
                    Some acknowledgment that Jews work 
                    here, too.  And don t say that 
                    shrub.

      Angle on a low greenish bush.

                                  SAM
                    You mean the Hannukah bush.

                                  ADAM
                    There s no such thing as a Hannukah 
                    bush.

      A WOMAN, 45, walks by.

                                  WOMAN
                    Merry Christmas, Sam.
                          (then, off Adam)
                    I mean, Happy Holidays.

                                  SAM
                    You, too, Alicia.  Have fun in Sun 
                    Valley.

      She smiles and EXITS.

                                  ADAM
                          (calling)
                    Great save, Alicia.  I feel much 
                    less persecuted.
                          (then, to Sam)
                    Why do you know her holiday plans?  
                    She works two desks down from me in 
                    the Art Department, and until just 
                    now, I thought her name was Olivia.

                                  SAM
                    That s because you artists look 
                    inward.  We reporters, we re 
                      interested in other people.  I 
                    waited in line for coffee with her 
                    on Tuesday.  She s kind of funny.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh, she s hilarious.  Everyone in 
                    the Art Department calls her Funny 
                    Olivia.

                                  SAM
                    Really?

                                  ADAM
                    No.
                          (then)

                                  ADAM (CONT'D)
                    What am I still doing here?  I have 
                      a refrigerator full of ham and a 
                    VCR full of porn.  Why am I not on 
                    my couch in my underwear?

                                  SAM
                    Because maybe you haven t quite hit 
                    rock bottom.

      SFX: Cell phone ring.

      Sam checks his phone, then:

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                    Hi, honey.


      INT. THE COOK RESIDENCE - SAME

      Mel s on the phone in her parents  large, living room.  
      INTERCUT through the call.

                                  MEL
                    How s the party?

                                  SAM
                    Amazing.  And by  amazing,  I mean 
                     pretty dull. 

                                  MEL
                    So why don t you come on out a 
                    little early?  You could be here 
                    for dinner.

                                  SAM
                    I d love to but the plan was arrive 
                    for pie, and once a plan s in 
                    place, it s a mistake to deviate.

                                  MEL
                    You re stalling, Sam.

                                  SAM
                    No, I m not.  I just don t like 
                      deviation.
                          (then)
                    I ve got to stay a little longer, 
                    Mel.  I don t want to look like I m 
                    not a team player.

      Just then, a very attractive, very drunk co-worker, NICKY, 
      comes up to Sam.  She s holding a sprig of MISTLETOE.        "Worst Week"                                           7.


                                  NICKY
                    Kiss, kiss, Sam.

      With a smile, Sam waves her off.

                                  MEL
                    Who s that?

                                  SAM
                    No one, honey.

      Nicky holds the sprig over Sam s head and lays a loud, wet 
      kiss as close to his mouth as she can get it.  Sam giggles.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                          (sotto)
                    Nicky!

      Nicky heads off with a smile.

                                  MEL
                    What are you doing?

                                  SAM
                    Nothing, Mel.  Honestly.

                                  MEL
                          (furious)
                    Sure, just being a good team 
                    player, right?  I sure hope having 
                    to be here for dessert doesn t 
                    intrude on your makeout sessions.

      She hangs up.

                                  SAM
                    Mel.  Mel?

      He CLOSES his phone.

                                  ADAM
                    I envy you.

                                  SAM
                    Shut up, Adam.  Mel s just been 
                    emotional since she got preg--

                                  ADAM
                    Since she got what?

                                  SAM
                    Nothing.        "Worst Week"                                           8.


                                  ADAM
                    She s pregnant! 

                                  SAM
                    Keep your voice down.

                                  ADAM
                    Do her parents know?  

                                  SAM
                    We re going to tell them this week.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh, what a nice Christmas gift.  
                    I m sure they ve always wanted a 
                    bastard grandchild.

                                  SAM
                    We re getting married.  We re 
                    telling them that, too.  

                                  ADAM
                    Well, that should ease the blow 
                    since they hate you.


      INT. THE COOK RESIDENCE

      Mel s still in the living room, looking sullen as she wraps a 
      Christmas present.  Her parents ENTER.  DICK COOK is mid-50s, 
      fit, handsome, serious.  ANGELA, also mid-50s, aging well and 
      naturally, always seems slightly tipsy.  She s in an apron.

                                  ANGELA
                    I ve finally finished stuffing the 
                    goose.

                                  DICK
                    Three days later.

                                  ANGELA
                    It s going to be quite a goose.  
                    And dinner s almost ready.  I 
                    forget, did you say your friend 
                    would be joining us or not?

                                  MEL
                    I said he would be joining us for 
                    dessert.

                                  ANGELA
                    Oh, good.  I m really proud of this 
                    pie.  The cherries have been 
                    soaking in brandy since Wednesday.        "Worst Week"                                           9.


                                  DICK
                          (to Mel)
                    And so has your mother.

                                  ANGELA
                          (playful)
                    Stop it, you.

                                  DICK
                    Mel, are you okay?

                                  MEL
                    Yeah, dad, I m fine.

                                  DICK
                    Was that your friend on the phone?  
                    Did he upset you.  If you want him 
                    to spend Christmas elsewhere and 
                    you don t have the nerve to tell 
                    him, I d be glad to do it for you.

                                  MEL
                    No, Dad, I love my friend, whose 
                    name, as you both know, is Sam, and 
                    you both promised to welcome him.

                                  ANGELA
                    And we do, dear.  Of course we do.  
                    Right, Dick?

                                  DICK
                          (non-commital)
                    Right.


      EXT. CAP WEEKLY MAGAZINE - NIGHT

      Sam s standing on the curb, talking into his cell.

                                  SAM
                    Mel, you re not picking up your 
                    cell.  What you heard back there, 
                    it was really nothing.  Someone 
                    walking around with mistletoe.  How 
                    desperate do you have to be, right?  
                    I should tell Adam to try it. 
                    Anyway, I m on my way.  Can t wait 
                    to dig into your mom s cherry pie.
                          (then)
                    And that sounded dirty.  Love you. 

      He hangs up.  A sports car comes tearing toward him, brakes 
      squealing as it SLAMS into the curb.  The window rolls down 
      to reveal Nicky, the drunk girl, in the drivers  seat.        "Worst Week"                                           10.


                                  NICKY
                    Hi, Sam.

                                  SAM
                    Oh, hey, Nicky.  Nicky, are you 
                    sure you should be driving?

                                  NICKY
                    Are you kidding?  This car 
                    basically drives itself.

      She GUNS it and slams into a street sign.  Sam looks around 
      to see if anyone else can deal with this, but there s no one.

                                  SAM
                          (to himself)
                    Dammit.


      EXT. CAP WEEKLY MAGAZINE - MOMENTS LATER

      Sam HELPS Nicky into a cab. 

                                  SAM
                          (to cabbie)
                    We re going to Bethesda.


      INT. CAB - MOMENTS LATER

      Nicky s sort of leaning on Sam, who looks uncomfortable.

                                  NICKY
                    My boyfriend broke up with me on 
                    Friday.

                                  SAM
                    Oh, I m sorry.

                                  NICKY
                    It s fine.  I shouldn t be with a 
                    guy like him, anyway.  He s like a 
                    cowboy, all quiet and big muscles 
                    and chiseled... 
                          (looks deeply at Sam) 
                    I should be with a guy like--

                                  SAM
                          (jumping in)
                    A lot of people don t know this, 
                    but I ve actually done a little 
                    cowboy slash ranchhand work.  
                    Roping, rustling.  Some branding.        "Worst Week"                                           11.


                                  NICKY
                      ...sometimes I watch you at work 
                    and I think naughty thoughts.

                                  SAM
                    Listen, Nicky -- okay-- I don t--

      She leans in and whispers something into Sam s ear.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                          (somewhat horrified)
                    Wow, that is naughty.

      He gently pushes Nicky away.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Nicky, that s very flattering... 
                    and a teensy bit degrading ... but 
                    I m about to get engaged.

                                  NICKY 
                          (beat)
                    Oh, God, I feel sick.

                                  SAM
                    Don t.  I think you re great.  It s 
                    just, I m really happy with Mel--

      Before he can finish, Nicky VOMITS in Sam s lap.


      EXT. BETHESDA NEIGHBORHOOD - MOMENTS LATER

      A dark quiet neighborhood.  Nicky s lying passed out on the 
      grass outside the cab.  Sam COMES AROUND the other side of 
      the car, his entire front side covered with vomit.  The 
      CABBIE is leaning into the back seat.  He COMES OUT, furious.

                                  CABBIE
                    I am known the world over for the 
                      cleanliness of my cab, and now 
                    this!  Stupid American holiday 
                    parties.

      And with that he JUMPS into his cab and SPEEDS off.  Sam 
      TURNS to the PASSED OUT Nicky, looks at his watch.  Shit.  He 
      pulls out his cell phone, dials.


      INT. COOK KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - SAME

      Tight on Mel s cell phone on the kitchen counter, quietly 
      BUZZING.  In the b.g., we see Mel eating dinner in the dining 
      room with her parents.  Mel steals a glance at her watch.        "Worst Week"                                           12.


      EXT. BETHESDA NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

      Sam waits for Mel to answer the phone.

                                  SAM
                    C mon, c mon.  Pick up.  Pick up!

      Nicky lets out a little MOAN.  Sam slams the cell shut.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                          (to Nicky)
                    Do you think you can make it the 
                    rest of the way on your own?

      Nicky lifts her head off the ground, looks around weakly, and 
      PLOPS her head back onto the dirt, out cold.


      EXT. BETHESDA STREET - MOMENTS LATER

      Sam is TRUDGING up hill with Nicky thrown over his shoulder.  
      It starts to RAIN.


      EXT. TOWNHOUSE ROW - LATER

      Sam has thrown Nicky in a trash can and is WHEELING her up to 
      her front stoop.  She sleeps peacefully.


      INT. NICKY S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Sam comes in from the hallway carrying Nicky.  He THROWS her 
      down onto the bed, catches his breath and then looks down at 
      his wet, soiled suit, cursing to himself. He looks over to 
      the bathroom then to the passed out Nicky.  Checks his watch.


      INT. COOK KITCHEN - SAME

      We see Angela pulling the cherry pie from the oven.  Mel is 
      tucked away in a corner with her cell phone in her hand.

                                  MEL
                          (sotto)
                    C mon, Sam.  Where are you? 

      Dick walks by and smiles at Mel.  She smiles back, covering. 


      INT. NICKY S BATHROOM - SAME

      We see the silhouette of Sam in the shower.         "Worst Week"                                           13.


      On the dresser, Sam s phone vibrates quietly.  It STOPS 
      buzzing just as Sam steps out of the shower onto the bath 
      mat, but then he sees there s NO TOWEL.  He checks a cabinet.  
      Nothing.  Dammit.  He EXITS.


      INT. NICKY S BEDROOM

      Sam ENTERS, NAKED, wet, and starts toward a cabinet by 
      Nicky s bed.  Nicky suddenly wakes up, sees a naked Sam in 
      front of her and SCREAMS.  Sam SCREAMS, too, and COVERS UP.

                                  NICKY
                    Sam, what are you doing?!

                                  SAM
                    I was just looking for a towel!

                                  NICKY
                          (getting up)
                    Get out, get out, get out!

      She starts waving him out of her bedroom and into the 
      hallway.  As he BACKS into the hallway:


      INT. HALLWAY

      She s frantically HERDING him down the hall.

                                  SAM
                    Nicky, this isn t what you think.

                                  NICKY
                    Get out or I ll call the police.

                                  SAM
                    You threw up on me and I was just 
                    trying to get cleaned up.

      Nicky picks up an umbrella in the hallway and starts POUNDING 
      on Sam.  Over his ad-libbed protests:

                                  NICKY
                    Get out!

      At the front door, she SHOVES him out.


      EXT. NICKY S TOWNHOUSE

      Sam is pushed out, wet and buck naked.  He tries to hold the 
      door open, but it is forced shut.  Then, he hears:        "Worst Week"                                           14.


                                  VOICES (O.S.)
                          (singing)
                    Good King Wenceslas looked out on 
                    the feast of Steven...

      Sam turns to see a group of YOUNG CAROLERS.  He covers up.

                                  SAM
                    Hi.  Merry Christmas.
                          (then, trying the locked 
                            door, loud whisper)
                    Nicky, open the door!  I wasn t 
                    trying to have sex with you!

                                  NICKY (V.O.)
                    I m dialing 9-1-1.

      Sam turns back to the carolers.

                                  SAM
                      Um...could I borrow some clothes?

      The carolers HURRY OFF.  Nicky s porch light goes out.  Sam 
      looks around, then heads over to a TRASH CAN.


      INT. COOK DINING ROOM - SAME

      Close on the remnants of a cherry pie.  Dick and Angela get 
      up, leaving Mel alone at the table, looking hurt.


      EXT. THE COOK RESIDENCE - LATER

      A cab, lights on, sits idling in the large circular driveway.  
      Sam, IN A DIAPER MADE FROM A TRASH BAG, is THROWING PEBBLES 
      at Mel s bedroom window.

                                  SAM
                          (loud whisper)
                      Mel...Mel!...Mel!!!

      Sam THROWS one more pebble.  Suddenly:

      SFX: A dog barking madly.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                          (Newman!)
                    Texaco!

      And all the LIGHTS GO ON IN THE HOUSE.  Sam hangs his head 
      and goes to the door.  Dick OPENS the door in his bathrobe.        "Worst Week"                                           15.


                                  DICK
                    Sam?

                                  SAM
                          (cheery)
                    Hello, Dick.  Merry Christmas.  
                    Hope I didn t wake you.

                                  DICK
                    It s two in the morning.

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    Dick, who is it?

                                  DICK
                          (calling)
                    It s Mel s friend, Sam.  In a giant 
                    plastic diaper.

                                  SAM
                          (re: bag)
                    Oh, this old thing, funny story--

      SFX: Car horn.

      Sam looks back at the cab.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Dick, could I borrow eighty 
                    dollars?  It s for the cab.  My 
                    wallet s in my...other pants.

      Dick, annoyed, goes off to get the money.  Sam steps inside.


      INT. THE COOK RESIDENCE

      The entryway is grand and decorated for Christmas.  Sam 
      ENTERS and looks around.  A big GERMAN SHEPHERD (TEXACO) 
      growls at him, and then starts sniffing at his trash bag.

                                  SAM
                          (to the dog)
                    Happy to see you too, Texaco.

      Texaco GROWLS menacingly at Sam. Angela COMES DOWN the 
      stairs, looking confused.

                                  ANGELA
                    Sam?

                                  SAM
                          (as if nothing s strange)
                    Angela, great to see you again!        "Worst Week"                                           16.


      He goes to kiss her hello.  She recoils slightly.  There s a 
      brief silence that Sam feels compelled to fill.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Good to see Texaco, too.  I read 
                    somewhere that German Shepherds are 
                    some of the smartest creatures on 
                    Earth.  Not as smart as dolphins 
                    but smarter than most monkeys.

                                  ANGELA
                    Oh.

      Mel ENTERS.

                                  MEL
                    Sam?

                                  SAM
                    Oh, hi, honey.  Just talking about 
                    German Shepherds.

      He goes to kiss her but she STEPS BACK.

                                  MEL
                    Where are your clothes?

                                  SAM
                          (waving it off)
                      Oh...don t ask.

                                  MEL
                    I am asking.

                                  SAM
                    Well...I shared a cab--

                                  MEL
                          (annoyed)
                    With that girl you were kissing?

                                  SAM
                    No!  No, with a guy...Mick.

                                  MEL
                    Mick?

                                  SAM
                    Yeah, you haven t met him.  
                      He s...the security guard.  
                      Absolutely hammered.  I wouldn t 
                    let him drive--        "Worst Week"                                           17.


                                  DICK
                          (REAPPEARING)
                    Should I pay the cabdriver?

                                  SAM
                    Thanks, Dick.

      Dick CROSSES through.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                          (to the ladies)
                    Anyway, Mick threw up on me in the 
                    cab--
                          (off their looks)
                    I know.  Yuck.  So I showered at 
                    his apartment.

                                  MEL
                    Didn t he have anything for you to 
                    wear?

                                  SAM
                    Nothing my size.  He s a dwarf.  
                    Well, not technically a dwarf, but, 
                    you know, as good as.

                                  MEL
                    Your security guard is a dwarf?

                                  SAM
                    Yeah.  I wouldn t want to mess with 
                    him, though.  He s vicious.

      Dick re-ENTERS.

                                  ANGELA
                    A vicious dwarf vomited on Sam, 
                    Dick.

                                  DICK
                          (flat)
                    Is that right?

                                  SAM
                    Can I just say how nice and 
                      Christmas-y everything looks.

                                  ANGELA
                      Um...thank you.

                                  SAM
                    Yeah, so, if it s all right, I 
                    really need to make a quick trip to 
                    the restroom.        "Worst Week"                                           18.


      He CROSSES past them.

                                  ANGELA
                          (calling)
                    Sam, use the powder room.

                                  SAM
                      Okey-doke!

      FX: The lights go out.

                                  ANGELA
                    Not again.

                                  SAM
                          (calling)
                    Sorry.

                                  ANGELA
                          (calling)
                    No, Sam it s not your fault.  The 
                    power goes out all the time.

                                  DICK
                          (pointed)
                    It hasn t been the same since they 
                    had to re-wire after the fire.  
                          (then)
                    I ll go down and fix it.

      He EXITS downstairs.  Sam EXITS toward the kitchen.


      INT. SMALL ROOM/KITCHEN

      In the dark, Sam is relieving himself.  Suddenly, the lights 
      go on and we see that Sam is NOT in the bathroom.  He s in 
      the pantry, which adjoins the kitchen.  Angela and Mel appear 
      in the b.g.  Sam realizes what he s done as they hurry over.

                                  MEL
                    Sam!

                                  SAM
                    I thought it was the powder room!  

                                  ANGELA
                    Oh my God.  My goose!  You ve 
                    urinated all over my goose.

                                  SAM
                    We can wash it off!        "Worst Week"                                           19.


      Sam picks up the tray with the goose and carries it onto the 
      big kitchen island.  As he walks, urine sloshes over the 
      sides and onto the floor.  Angela s borderline hysterical:

                                  ANGELA
                          (re: urine)
                    You re spilling everywhere.  How 
                    much have you had to drink?

                                  MEL
                    I ll get a mop.

                                  ANGELA
                    Three days I ve been working on 
                    that goose.

                                  SAM
                    Angela, I am so, so sorry.

      Dick re-ENTERS from downstairs.

                                  DICK
                    Angela, there s something wrong 
                    with that trip switch...

                                  ANGELA
                    Dick, be careful!

      But it s too late.  Dick doesn t see the puddle of urine.  
      HIS FEET SLIP and he comes CRASHING DOWN as the screen goes 

                                                                              BLACK:

                                            ACT TWO


      INT. COOK KITCHEN - MORNING

      CARD: December 21st.

      Sam is in the kitchen by himself.  He has a bowl of cereal.  
      He opens the fridge and takes out the milk.  When he closes 
      the fridge, the dog Texaco is right there, STARTLING HIM. 

                                  SAM
                    Ahh.
                          (then, off Texaco s snarl)
                    Texaco!  You just start herding 
                    first thing in the morning, huh?

      Sam looks in the fridge and grabs the slice of cherry pie 
      that was left for him.  He throws it out the back door.  
      Texaco RUNS out.  Sam SLAMS the door shut.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    I don t think a dolphin would have 
                    fallen for that.

      Sam sits down with his cereal.  Mel ENTERS.  She looks pale.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                          (sotto)
                    Did you just...you know...

                                  MEL
                    You don t have to whisper.  My 
                    parents are still at the hospital.  
                    And yes.
                          (then)
                    Is it possible to vomit so much 
                    that you actually throw up the 
                    baby?

                                  SAM
                    Yes.  That s common, actually.
                          (off Mel s smile)
                    I am so sorry about last night.  
                    About everything.  About missing 
                    dessert, about...the goose...

                                  MEL
                          (taking his hand)
                    Hey, listen, I ve lived here my 
                    whole life and I still get lost in 
                    this house.  I m always 
                      accidentally peeing in places that 
                    aren t bathrooms.         "Worst Week"                                           21.


                                  SAM
                    I m trying to apologize, here.

                                  MEL
                    I usually pee in the fridge.

                                  SAM
                          (smiling)
                    I m going to punch you in the face.

      Dick and Angela have ENTERED just in time to hear that last 
      line out of context.  Sam turns to see Dick GLARING AT HIM, 
      trying to understand what he s heard.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Oh, hello, guys.
                          (off Dick s look)
                    We were just joking around.

                                  DICK
                    That s very funny.

                                  SAM
                    No, in context, you would have--

                                  DICK
                    Yes, tell me the context in which 
                    punching my daughter in the face 
                    would be funny.  
                          (then)
                    Who locked the dog outside?

      Mel looks at Sam.  Sam looks at Dick.

                                  SAM 
                    No idea.

                                  DICK
                    And I m sure you have no idea how 
                    his nose got covered in cherry pie, 
                    either.

      Everyone glares at Sam, who shrinks into his seat.  Then:

                                  DICK (CONT'D)
                    The rule here is, Texaco stays 
                    inside unless he s doing his 
                    business.  If he s locked out, he 
                    scratches to get in.  I just paid 
                    $840 to have the mud-room door re-
                    sanded and re-painted because of a 
                    former cleaning person s inability 
                    to follow that rule.  I don t like 
                    wasting money.        "Worst Week"                                           22.


                                  MEL
                    Dad, how are you?

                                  ANGELA
                    The hospital wanted to keep him for 
                    another night, but your father s so 
                    stubborn.

                                  DICK
                    Darling, I m fine.  And I m not 
                    going to miss the Bar Council 
                    Christmas Luncheon.  I haven t 
                    missed one in thirty years, I m not 
                    missing this one.
                          (then)
                    I m just going to feed my birds and 
                    then get going.

      And Dick s OUT.  Angela watches him go.

                                  ANGELA
                    Oh, it makes me nervous, him out 
                    and about after such a big fall.  
                    Such a stubborn old coot.
                          (then, brightening)
                    That reminds me.  Come with me.  

      Mel and Sam GET UP and FOLLOW Angela out.

                                  ANGELA (CONT D)
                          (noticing Sam)
                    Okay, you, too, Sam.


      INT. BREAKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      It s a dark little room.  Angela goes to the back wall and 
      lifts a black tarp to reveal an enormous PORTRAIT OF DICK, in 
      his judge s robe.  He looks regal and scary.  Sam GASPS.

                                  ANGELA
                    It s his Christmas present.  Do you 
                    love it?  It s by the same man who 
                    does all the portraits of the 
                      Presidents.  He s been working on 
                    it for over a year.  He said it s 
                    his masterpiece.

                                  MEL
                    Dad looks very stern.

                                  ANGELA
                    I know.  Which he can be.  But see 
                    that little gleam in his eye?         "Worst Week"                                           23.


      Sam leans in, looking for that gleam.  He can t find it.

                                  ANGELA  (CONT D)
                    Your father s playful, too.  That s 
                    what a good portrait does: it gives 
                    the whole sense of a person.  Which 
                    is what a photo never captures.

                                  MEL
                          (to Sam)
                    My mom hates photos.

                                  SAM
                          (to Angela)
                    Mel hates them, too.  Which makes 
                    sense since she s your daughter and 
                    you come from the same gene pool.  
                    The same photo-hating gene pool. 
                    DNA.  It s some crazy stuff.

      Angela studies Sam for a beat, then--

                                  ANGELA
                    Yes, well, I think they look like 
                    ads for  family.   So tacky.  I 
                    refuse to have them splattered 
                    around the house. 
                          (then, re: portrait)
                    But this, this will tell whoever 
                    sees it for the next thousand years 
                    something real, something true 
                    about the man who lived here.

                                  SAM
                          (moving side to side)
                    Look, the eyes seem to follow you.
                          (then, off their looks)
                    I love it.


      EXT. TOWN OF MANASSAS - DAY

      Dick STROLLS along the sidewalk of this small quaint town 
      PAST A SIGN POINTING TO THE TRAIN STATION.  He suddenly looks 
      a little shaky.  He puts his hand to his head, then against a 
      wall to brace himself.  He tries to shake it off, but his 
      knees go wobbly and he FALLS to the ground.  His glasses fall 
      a few feet away.  Camera PANS up to a sign on the shop he s 
      fallen in front of.  It reads: HEWITT S FUNERAL HOME.


      INT. HEWITT S FUNERAL HOME, FRONT

      The FUNERAL DIRECTOR leads a still-shaky Dick in.        "Worst Week"                                           24.


                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                    Nice and easy, Judge Cook.

      A different undertaker brings Dick a glass of water.  He 
      takes a sip, then FAINTS again.  The funeral director catches 
      him by the shoulders.  The glass crashes to the floor.

                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT D)
                          (to the undertaker)
                    Take him to the back.

      The undertaker LEADS Dick to the back.


      INT. HEWITT S FUNERAL HOME, BACK

      The undertaker sits Dick down on one of the tables.

                                  DICK
                    Thank you.

      Dick lies back.  The undertaker PLACES DICK S GLASSES ON A 
      TRAY near Dick s gurney, then EXITS.


      INT. THE COOK RESIDENCE - DAY

      SFX: Phone ringing.

      A cheery, showered Sam comes hurrying into the front hallway.

                                  SAM
                          (calling)
                    Angela!  Angela!
                          (then, picking up phone)
                    Hello, Cook residence.


      INT. HEWITT S FUNERAL HOME

      The funeral director is on the phone.  INTERCUT throughout.

                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                    Hello, it s Hewitt s, the 
                      undertakers.  Is Mrs. Cook in?

                                  SAM
                    No, she s not.  But this is Sam, 
                    their daughter Mel s fiance, well 
                      soon-to-be, don t tell anyone. 
                    She s pregnant, too.  But that s a 
                    story for a different day.  Anyway, 
                    can I help with something?        "Worst Week"                                           25.


                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                    Yes, well, we ve got Mr. Cook.  I m 
                    afraid he collapsed in the street.

      Sam s face goes ashen.

                                  SAM
                          (beat)
                    What? 

                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                    We found him on the sidewalk.

                                  SAM
                          (upset)
                    He was fine half an hour ago.

                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                    We ve put him in the back room.

                                  SAM
                    Oh my God.

                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                    Hopefully you can get down here as 
                    soon as possible.

                                  SAM
                          (stunned)
                    Yeah.  Yes, of course.  Thank you.

      He hangs up and takes this in for a beat.  Then Angela and 
      Mel ENTER with groceries, laughing.  They see Sam, who looks 
      like he s just found out someone s died.

                                  ANGELA
                    Sam, is everything all right?

                                  SAM
                    That was Hewitt s on the phone.

                                  ANGELA
                    The undertakers?

                                  SAM
                          (beat)
                    They ve got Dick.  He collapsed in 
                    the street.

                                  ANGELA
                    I don t understand.        "Worst Week"                                           26.


                                  SAM
                          (beat)
                    Dick s dead.


      INT. HEWITT S FUNERAL HOME, FRONT

      Dick comes in from the back, looking steadier on his feet.

                                  DICK
                    Thank you, Martin.  I m feeling 
                    much better.

                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                    Are you sure, Judge Cook?  I just 
                    spoke to someone at your house 
                    ...Sam?  He s on his way over.

                                  DICK
                    God no, he s the last person I need 
                    to see now.  Got to catch my train.
                          (then, to the undertakers, 
                          as he EXITS)
                    Goodbye, gentlemen, I hope not to 
                    need you for a few years yet.

      And he s OUT.  Watching him go, the FUNERAL DIRECTOR sees 
      something outside, then turns to the others.

                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                    All right, guys, there s Larry.  
                    Shall we?

      They start to gather their things.

      Another younger undertaker, LARRY, ENTERS from the street.

                                  LARRY
                    I m back.


      INT. THE COOK RESIDENCE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

      Mel is sobbing.  Sam walks up to her and gives her a big hug.

                                  SAM
                    I m so sorry, Mel.

                                  MEL
                    I never even got to tell him about 
                    the baby.

                                  SAM
                    I know.        "Worst Week"                                           27.


                                  MEL
                    If it s a boy, I want to name him 
                     Dick. 

                                  SAM
                          (doesn t like this name)
                    Oh.  Well...that s something we can 
                    talk about.

      We hear Angela WAILING in the background.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    You know, maybe we should tell your 
                    mom about the baby.  That might be 
                    a little good news right now.

                                  ANGELA (O.S.)
                    Stupid Sam and his stupid urine all 
                    over the floor!  Stupid, stupid!
                          (ENTERING, to Sam)
                    You killed him!  You killed Dick!

      Angela EXITS.

                                  SAM
                    Or maybe we should wait to tell 
                    her.

                                  MEL
                    Yes.

                                  SAM
                    Why don t I go to the undertakers 
                    and deal with the paperwork?  You 
                    take care of your mom.

      Mel nods.


      INT. HEWITT S FUNERAL HOME, FRONT

      Sam enters.  Larry is going over some paperwork.

                                  SAM
                    Hello, hi, I m here on behalf of 
                    Mrs. Cook.
                          (off Larry s blank look)
                    Her husband Dick...well, earlier 
                    this morning he...he died.

                                  LARRY
                    Yes.  Yes, I m sorry I m so 
                    clueless.  I just got back from 
                    vacation.  Come on back.        "Worst Week"                                           28.


      He motions Sam towards the back.


      INT. HEWITT S FUNERAL HOME, BACK

      Larry walks back to two cabinets where the bodies are stored.

                                  LARRY
                    Have you ever identified a body 
                    before?  There s usually some 
                      discoloration.  It can be kind of 
                      unsettling.

                                  SAM
                    What?  I thought I d just sign some 
                    papers.

                                  LARRY
                    Oh, no.  The body has to be i.d. d.  
                    You squeamish around dead bodies?  
                    Here s a secret: I am, too.

                                  SAM
                    Oh, well...

                                  LARRY
                    Why did I pick this job, you ask?

                                  SAM
                    No, I didn t.

                                  LARRY
                    I have no idea.  I just spent the 
                    whole week with my cousin who s 
                    studying to be a chef...Now that 
                    seems like a fun job.
                          (opening cabinet and 
                            unzipping body bag)
                    All those good smells in the 
                    kitchen.
                          (then)
                    Is this him?

                                  SAM
                          (peeking in, quickly)
                    Nope.  Not him.

                                  LARRY
                    Really?  Ugh.  Sorry.  And now we 
                    get to look at another one.  Yay.
                          (opening another bag)
                    How about this guy?  Holy crap what 
                    happened to his lips?          "Worst Week"                                           29.

                          (peeking in, winces)
                    Uch.  No, that s not him, either.  
                    God, I feel sick.

                                  LARRY
                    Welcome to my world.  Constant 
                    nausea.  Instead I could be making 
                    sauces and little puff pastries.  
                    People would love me instead of 
                    crossing the street when I walk by.

                                  LARRY (CONT D)
                    Shoot, let me grab that. 
                          (pointing to a body in 
                            plastic on a gurney)
                    Must be that one.  Be right back.

      Larry EXITS.  Sam walks to the gurney.  He steels himself to 
      open the bag, but then notices Dick s GLASSES on the tray.  
      He picks them up, handles them, sadly.  Larry RETURNS.

                                  LARRY (CONT D)
                    Sorry.
                          (re: gurney)
                    So, is that him?

                                  SAM
                    Yes.  These are his glasses.


      INT. THE COOK RESIDENCE - DICK S STUDY

      Angela and Mel are in Dick s special room, just off the front 
      hallway.  They re standing by a birdcage, watching several 
      colorful FINCHES flitting around inside.

                                  ANGELA
                    Your father loved these annoying 
                    birds.  He would spend hours with 
                    them.  He knew everyone of them by 
                    the sound of its voice.
                          (then, breaking down)
                    Such a sweet, sweet man!

      Mel starts to cry, too, as Sam ENTERS, cautiously.

                                  SAM
                    It s done.  I said we d call to 
                    figure out funeral arrangements.         "Worst Week"                                           30.


                                  ANGELA
                    How did he look?

                                  SAM
                    What?  Oh...He looked...Yeah, he 
                    looked good.  He looked peaceful.

                                  ANGELA
                    Did he?

                                  SAM
                    Very.  You actually got the 
                    feeling, looking at him, that any 
                    recent unpleasantness had been long 
                    forgiven.

                                  ANGELA
                    That s a comfort.
                          (checking watch, to Mel)
                    It s nearly midnight in Nairobi.  
                    If we wait any longer we won t be 
                    able to reach your brother until 
                    morning.  I called your sisters, I 
                    don t think I can bear another 
                      conversation.  Will you call David, 
                    Mel?

                                  MEL
                    Oh, God, I can t.  Sam, would you?

                                  SAM
                    Really?  I mean, I ve never met him 
                    and wouldn t it be sort of weird...
                          (off their grieving looks)
                    ...yeah, okay. 


      INT. THE COOK RESIDENCE, KITCHEN

      Sam s on the phone.

                    He s dead!!

      Off camera we hear Angela SHRIEK, and then SOB LOUDLY.

                          (still can t be heard)

                            sports arena)
                    HE S DEAD!!!!

      As Angela WAILS in the b.g., Mel ENTERS in a hurry.

                                  MEL
                    Sam!  What are you doing?

                                  SAM
                    He s on a cell.  I guess there s 
                    bad coverage there.

      She takes the phone from him.

                                  MEL
                          (annoyed)
                    Will you run into town and get my 
                    mom some more valium.  The pharmacy 
                    closes in fifteen minutes.

                                  SAM
                    Sure, sure.  Sorry, honey.


      INT. DICK S CAR - NIGHT

      Dick is driving along in the dark, SINGING a holiday song.


      EXT. THE COOK RESIDENCE - SAME

      Sam HURRIES outside, JUMPS into the car, and SPEEDS out of 
      the driveway.  He goes about twenty feet then sees something 
      and SLAMS on the brakes, too late.

      SFX: CAR CRASH.        "Worst Week"                                           32.


      The screen goes BLACK for a second.  We come back up on Dick 
      SLUMPED over the steering wheel, passed out, smoke from his 
      radiator billowing up around him.

      Sam gets out of his car and comes around to inspect the 
      damage.  The bumpers are mangled.  Then he comes around to 
      the driver s side and sees:

                                  SAM
                    Dick!
                          (then,, overjoyed)
                    Dick, you re alive.  You re alive!


      INT. THE COOK RESIDENCE, FRONT HALLWAY

      An excited Sam DRAGS Dick, who s UNCONSCIOUS, into the house.

                                  SAM
                    Angela!  Angela, I ve got Dick!

      Angela ENTERS, looking confused and slightly angry.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Angela, look what I found?!

                                  ANGELA
                          (appalled)
                    Sam!

                                  SAM
                          (laughing)
                    It s Dick.  He s here.

                                  ANGELA
                    What are you doing?

                                  SAM
                    I ve got him!

                                  ANGELA
                    Take him back!

                                  SAM
                    What?

                                  ANGELA
                    Take my husband s body back to the 
                      undertaker s.

                                  SAM
                    Oh no, you don t understand.

      But Angela s had it.  She starts POUNDING on Sam.        "Worst Week"                                           33.


                                  ANGELA
                    Take him back, you sick, sick--

      Just then, Dick comes to, very groggily.

                                  DICK
                    What s going on?

      And this STOPS Angela.  She SCREAMS and then FAINTS dead 
      away, leaving Sam with two lifeless bodies.

                                  SAM
                          (after a beat)
                    Mel!


      INT. THE COOK RESIDENCE, MEL S ROOM

      Mel ENTERS.   A sad Sam sits on the bed.

                                  MEL
                          (re: her parents)
                    They re fine.  They actually 
                    laughed about it, kind of.  Like an 
                    internal chuckle.  Nearly 
                      undetectable.  
                          (sitting)
                    Look, it s going to get better, I 
                    promise.

                                  SAM
                    What s the matter with me?

                                  MEL
                    You re nervous.  You re nervous 
                    because a lot of stuff s happening 
                    in our lives.  And that s making 
                    you do some really stupid things.  
                    Really stupid.  Really, really--

                                  SAM
                    Mel--

                                  MEL
                    But I want you to know something: 
                    no matter what you do, I m still 
                    going to love you.

                                  SAM
                    Why?

                                  MEL
                          (pulling her arms back)
                    Hey, I never thought about  why.  
                                  (MORE)        "Worst Week"                                           34.

                                  MEL (CONT'D)
                          (thinking)
                    Maybe I don t love you.

      She PUNCHES him playfully.  That progresses into a little 
      tickling match, and then a long, deep KISS.  And from there, 
      it looks like things are going to go further, but Sam STOPS:

                                  SAM
                    Oh, no.  This I m not doing.  
                    You re evil.  Good night.

                                  MEL
                    Fine.  Your loss.  Hey, don t kill 
                    anybody on the way to your room.


      INT. HALLWAY

      Outside Dick and Angela s room, the door is opened slightly 
      as Sam PASSES.  He hears them talking and STOPS.

                                  DICK (V.O.)
                    You know I d say he s a horse s ass 
                    but I don t think that s fair to 
                    horses or asses.

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    Keep your voice down, Dick.

      Sam s face falls.

                                  DICK (V.O.)
                    Mel has such good instincts.  What 
                    could she possibly see in him?

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    Come on, old man.  Come snuggle  
                    with me.

      But just then, ALL THE LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT.

                                  DICK (V.O.)
                    That s great.  Another little gift 
                    from our boy, Sam.  

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    We don t need lights for what I 
                    have planned.

                                  DICK (V.O.)
                    Oh, fine.

      In the darkness, SAM HAS AN IDEA.        "Worst Week"                                           35.


      INT. BREAKER ROOM

      Sam ENTERS holding a candle.  He goes to the big breaker box, 
      but then notices the black tarp in the corner.  He can t 
      resist lifting it.  Dick s portrait stares at him.  After a 
      beat, he sets the candle on the shelf and opens the breaker 
      box.  It s massive.  Sam has no idea what does what.

                                  SAM
                          (to himself)
                    Well, you can t make the power go 
                    more out.

      He takes a shot, picking one of the breakers and, 
      miraculously, the lights FLICKER ON.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Oh my God.  I did it.  I did it!  
                    Let s see a horse s ass do that.
                          (turning to the portrait)
                    In your face!

      What he sees when he turns to the portrait is that he s left 
      the candle too close and Dick s FACE has been charred BLACK.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no.

      He starts to rub on the blackness but nothing s happening.  
      If anything, he s making it worse.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Oh, come on.  You ve got to be 
                    kidding me.  Come on!
