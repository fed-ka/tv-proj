(1951)
A little boy closes his eyes tightly. It is young Forrest as
he sits in a doctor's office.
FORREST (V.O.)
She said they was my magic shoes.
Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg
braces.
DOCTOR
All right, Forrest, you can open
your eyes now. Let's take a little
walk around.
The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet. Forrest walks around
stiffly. Forrest's mother, MRS. GUMP, watches him as he clanks
around the room awkwardly.
DOCTOR
How do those feel? His legs are
strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've
ever seen. But his back is as crooked
as a politician.
Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump.
DOCTOR
But we're gonna straighten him right
up now, won't we, Forrest?
A loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls.
MRS. GUMP
Forrest!
PRINCIPAL
Your boy's... different, Mrs. Gump.
Now, his I.Q. is seventy-five.
MRS. GUMP
Well, we're all different, Mr.
Hancock.
The principal sighs, then stands up.
Forrest sits outside the principal's office and waits.
FORREST (V.O.)
She wanted me to have the finest
education, so she took me to the
Greenbow County Central School. I
met the principal and all.
The principal stands in front of Mrs. Gump. Forrest, sitting
left, listens.
PRINCIPAL
I want to show you something, Mrs.
Gump. Now, this is normal.
The principal holds up a chart with a designations according
to I.Q. and points to the center of the graph, labeled
"Normal." A red line below the normal area is labeled "State
Acceptance." The principal points to the section below the
acceptance line labeled "Below."
PRINCIPAL
Forrest is right here. The state
requires a minimum I.Q. of eighty to
attend public school, Mrs. Gump.
He's gonna have to go to a special
school. Now, he'll be just fine.
MRS. GUMP
What does normal mean, anyway? He
might be a bit on the slow side, but
my boy Forrest is going to get the
same opportunities as everyone else.
He's not going to some special school
to learn to how to re-tread tires.
We're talking about five little points
here. There must be something can be
done.
Forrest sits outside the principal's office.
PRINCIPAL
We're a progressive school system.
We don't want to see anybody left
behind.
PRINCIPAL
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?
MRS. GUMP
He's on vacation.
Mrs. Gump reads from the book "Curious George" as Forrest
sits on the bed and listens.
MRS. GUMP
Finally, he had to try it. It looked
easy, but, oh, what happened. First
there...
FORREST
Momma, what's vacation mean?
MRS. GUMP
Vacation?
FORREST
Where Daddy went?
MRS. GUMP
Vacation's when you go somewhere,
and you don't ever come back.
Forrest lies down on his bed and looks up.
FORREST (V.O.)
Anyway, I guess you could say me and
Momma was on our own.
Mrs. Gump steps forward and speaks to all the boarders.
MRS. GUMP
It's suppa, everyone. Forrest...
A MAN WITH A CANE steps left across the hall.
MAN WITH CANE
My, my. That sure looks special.
Mrs. Gump looks into a sitting room and informs the boarders
about dinner.
MRS. GUMP
Gentlemen, would you care to join us
for supper? Hurry up and get it before
the flies do. I prefer you don't
smoke that cigar so close to mealtime.
FORREST (V.O.)
Sometimes we had so many people
stayin' with us that every room was
filled with travelers. You know,
folks livin' out of their suitcases,
and hat cases, and sample cases.
MRS. GUMP
Well, you go ahead and start. I can't
find Forrest.
Mrs. Gump walks up the stairs.
MRS. GUMP
Forrest... Forrest...
FORREST (V.O.)
One time a young man was staying
with us, and he had him a guitar
case.
Mrs. Gump looks into Forrest's room. She hears singing coming
from another room and walks over to a closed door. Mrs. Gump
opens the door, revealing a young man with long sideburns as
he plays the guitar and sings. Forrest holds onto a broom
and dances oddly. The young man is ELVIS PRESLEY.
ELVIS PRESLEY
(sings)
"Well, you ain't never caught a
rabbit, and you ain't no friend of
mine."
Forrest's legs rock back and forth to the guitar.
MRS. GUMP
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.
ELVIS
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. I
was just showin' him a thing or two
on the guitar here.
MRS. GUMP
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.
ELVIS
Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you,
ma'am.
Mrs. Gump leaves and closes the door. Elvis sits back down.
Forrest stands left, and looks himself in a mirror.
ELVIS
Say, man, show me that crazy little
walk you just did there. Slow it
down some.
Forrest begins to dance again as Elvis plays the guitar and
sings.
ELVIS
(sings)
"You ain't nothin' but a hound, hound
dog..."
FORREST (V.O.)
I liked that guitar.
Forrest dances as he watches himself in the mirror.
FORREST (V.O.)
It sounded good.
ELVIS
(sings)
"...cryin' all the time"
Forrest rocks up and down on his braced legs, then begins to
step.
ELVIS
(sings)
"You ain't nothin' but a hound dog..."
FORREST (V.O.)
I started moving around to the music,
swinging my hips. This one night me
and Momma...
Forrest steps up onto the bus. Mrs. Gump waves to Forrest as
the bus drives away. Forrest begins to walk down the aisle.
TWO YOUNG BOYS look up from the seat.
BOY #1
This seat's taken.
BOY #2
It's taken!
Forrest looks around. A larger girl slides over so Forrest
can't sit next to her. She shakes her head. Forrest looks to
the other side where a boy sits alone on a larger seat. They
boy glares up at Forrest.
BOY #3
You can't sit here.
FORREST (V.O.)
You know, it's funny what a young
man recollects. 'Cause I don't
remember being born.
Young Forrest is still standing in the aisle on the bus.
FORREST (V.O.)
...in the wide world.
GIRL
You can sit here if you want.
Forrest looks back at JENNY CURRAN, a young girl about
Forrest's age.
FORREST (V.O.)
I had never seen anything so beautiful
in my life. She was like an angel.
JENNY
Well, are you gonna sit down, or
aren't ya?
Forrest sits down next to Jenny.
JENNY
What's wrong with your legs?
FORREST
Um, nothing at all, thank you. My
legs are just fine and dandy.
FORREST (V.O.)
I just sat next to her on that bus
and had conversation all the way to
school.
JENNY
Then why do you have those shoes on?
FORREST
My momma said my back's crooked like
a question mark. These are going to
make me as straight as an arrow.
They're my magic shoes.
FORREST (V.O.)
And next to Momma, no one ever talked
to me or asked me questions.
JENNY
Are you stupid or something.
FORREST
Mommy says stupid is as stupid does.
Jenny puts her hand out toward Forrest. Forrest reaches over
and shakes her hand.
JENNY
I'm Jenny.
FORREST
I'm Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.
FORREST (V.O.)
From that day on, we was always
together. Jenny and me was like peas
and carrots.
Forrest nods as he remembers.
FORREST
My only friend.
Forrest continues talking to the black woman. She doesn't
seem to be listening as she reads her magazine. She looks up
from her magazine.
FORREST
Now, my Momma always told me that
miracles happen every day. Some people
don't think so, but they do.
Jenny lies in bed next to young Forrest. She hugs him.
FORREST (V.O.)
...but I think it was her grandma's
dog. He was a mean dog. Anyway, Jenny
and me was best friends...
BOY
Ya-hoo!

An anchorman named CHET HUNTLEY appears over the television.
CHET HUNTLEY
(on TV)
Federal troops enforcing a court
order integrated the University of
Alabama today.
A black & white television reveals George Wallace as he stands
in the doorway of the schoolhouse.
KATZENBACH

Governor Wallace, I take it from
that, uh...
A football coach looks at a black and white television as a

NEWSMAN
Here by videotape is the encounter
by General Graham, Commander of the
National Guard, and Governor Wallace.
Forrest stands next to George Wallace and listens.
GOVERNOR WALLACE
We must have no violence today, or
any other day, because these National
Guardsmen are here today as Federal
Soldiers for Alabamans. And they
live within our borders and they are
all our brothers. We are winning in
this fight because we are awakening
the American people to the dangers
that we have spoken about so many
times, just so evident today, the
trend toward military dictatorship
in this country.
A coach looks at the television. The television reveals
Forrest as he stands at the schoolhouse door. He looks around,
then waves.
CHET HUNTLEY
(on TV)
Governor Wallace did what he promised
to do. By being on the Tuscaloosa
campus, he kept the mob from gathering
and prevented violence.
An assistant coach looks at the television, then at the other
coaches.
ASSISTANT COACH
Say, wasn't that Gump?
The football coach and two assistant coaches look. Forrest
dries himself off with a towel as he steps from the showers.
CHET HUNTLEY
(on TV)
NBC News will present a special
program on the Alabama integration
story at 7:30 p.m. tonight...
ASSISTANT COACH
Naw, that couldn't be.
FOOTBALL COACH
It sure as hell was.
CHET HUNTLEY
...standard Eastern Daylight Time.
Now a word from Anacin.
Forrest steps up to the coaches' area and grabs a clean towel.
The coaches turn and stare at Forrest. Forrest gives them
one of his silly waves, then walks away.
COLOR FOOTAGE - Governor Wallace waves to the crowd as he
stands behind a podium with his wife.
FORREST (V.O.)
A few years later, that angry little
man at the schoolhouse door thought
it would be a good idea, and ran for
President.
COLOR FOOTAGE - Governor Wallace mingles in a crowd. Gunshots
are fired, wounding him. Some men wrestle the shooter. Wallace
lies wounded on the ground.
FORREST (V.O.)
But, somebody thought that it wasn't.
Jenny and Forrest sneak to Jenny's door.
FORREST
Is this your room?
JENNY
Shh!
Jenny unlocks the door and they step inside.
Jenny pulls a robe off of her sleeping roommate's bed. Jenny
hands the robe to Forrest, sitting on Jenny's bed.
JENNY
Do you ever dream, Forrest, about
who you're gonna be?
FORREST
Who I'm gonna be?
JENNY
Yeah.
FORREST
Aren't I going to be me?
JENNY
Well, you'll always be you, just
another kind of you. You know? I
want to be famous.
Jenny picks up a towel, then walks back toward Forrest. Jenny
dries the water from her hair.
JENNY
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.
I just want to be an empty stage
with my guitar, my voice... just me.
Jenny takes off her slip and sits on the bed next to him.
She is only wearing her bra and panties. Forrest looks at
Jenny like he's never seen a woman in her underwear before.
JENNY
And I want to reach people on a
personal level. I want to be able to
say things, just one-to-one.
Forrest looks down at Jenny's breasts. Jenny realizes that
he is looking at her.
JENNY
Have you ever been with a girl,
Forrest?
FORREST
I sit next to them in my home
economics class all the time.
DJ
(over radio)
You're listening to WHHY in
Birmingham, the clear A.M. voice of
Northern Alabama. I'm Joel Dorn...
Forrest looks at Jenny as she removes her bra. Forrest looks
away, a bit shamed. Jenny takes his hand and guides it up to
her breast.
DJ
(over radio)
...coming to you on a night that is
anything but clear. The weatherman
says that rain's gonna fall all night
long so stay with us, get warm, get
cozy, get under the covers to the
cool sounds of WHHY.
Forrest looks over at Jenny's breasts, the shudder as he has
an orgasm.
FORREST
Ohh... Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.
JENNY
It's okay.
DJ
(over radio)
...444-6789, with ya till sunrise,
playing the music you want to hear
when you want to hear it. If you
have a request or dedication, give
us a call. We guarantee you'll hear
your requests within one hour.
Forrest breathes heavily. Jenny puts her bra back on.
JENNY
It's all right.
Jenny leans over and puts her head on Forrest's shoulder.
DJ
(over radio)
Candy is on the line tonight. Candy's
answering the phones, give Candy
your request, your dedication, and
ask her why she won't go out with
me, would you? Here's more music.
JENNY
It's okay.
FORREST
Oh, I'm dizzy.
A song is coming over the radio. Jenny hugs Forrest.
JENNY
I bet that never happened in home
ec.
FORREST
No.
Jenny laughs and kisses Forrest on the cheek. Forrest and
Jenny hug on the bed as Jenny's roommate pretends to be
asleep, but is listening, horrified, with her eyes open.
FORREST
I think I ruined your roommate's
bathrobe.
JENNY
I don't care. I don't like her,
anyway.
The All-American players mingle around the food table. Forrest
steps up to the table. A large spread of food and soda is on
the table.
FORREST (V.O.)
Now, the real good thing about meeting
the President of the United States
is the food.
Forrest takes a bottle of Dr. Pepper from the buffet table.
Numerous bottle of Dr. Pepper are displayed on the table. A
servant opens the bottle for him.
FORREST (V.O.)
They put you in this little room
with just about anything you'd want
to eat or drink. And since number
one, I wasn't hungry, but thirsty...
Forrest begins to guzzle the Dr. Pepper.
FORREST (V.O.)
...and number two, they was free, I
musta drank me about fifteen Dr.
Peppers.
Forrest sets down an empty Dr. Pepper bottle next to a large
number of other empty bottles. Forrest holds his stomach and
burps.
BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE - President Kennedy shakes hands
with the All-American football players.
PRESIDENT KENNEDY
Congratulations. How does it feel to

President's hand.

I gotta pee.
President Kennedy turns and smiles.
PRESIDENT KENNEDY
I believe he said he had to go pee.
Forrest urinates in the bathroom, then lowers the lid and
flashes. Forrest washes his hands, then notices an autographed
photo from Marilyn Monroe and a photo of John with his brother
Bobby.
FORREST (V.O.)
Sometime later, for no particular
reason, somebody shot that nice young
President when he was ridin' in his
car.

ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - Robert Kennedy stands at a podium as people
around him applaud.
FORREST (V.O.)

Forrest steps onto the army bus. Rain pours outside as the
army bus driver yells at Forrest.
FORREST
...Forrest Gump.
ARMY BUS DRIVER
Nobody gives a hunk of shit who you
are, fuzzball! You're not even a
lowlife scum sucking maggot! Get
your faggoty ass on the bus. You're
in the Army now!
Forrest is about to sit on the first available seat, but the
recruit sitting there refuses Forrest.
RECRUIT #1
This seat's taken.
Forrest tries to sit on the next seat, but the 2nd recruit
slides over, blocking him.
RECRUIT #2
It's taken.
Forrest steps forward, looking much like he did on his first
bus ride to school years ago.
FORREST (V.O.)
At first, it seemed like I made a
mistake.
A large black recruit with a strange look on his face, much
like Forrest's, looks up from his seat. His name is BUBBA.
FORREST (V.O.)
...seeing how it was my induction
day and I was already gettin' yelled
at.
Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit
down.
BUBBA
You can sit down... if you want to.
FORREST (V.O.)
I didn't know who I might meet or
what they might ask.
Bubba hands Forrest a handkerchief.
BUBBA
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?
FORREST
No, but I been on a real big boat.
BUBBA
I'm talkin' about a shrimp catchin'
boat. I've been workin' on shrimp
boats all my life. I started out my
uncle's boat, that's my mother's
brother, when I was about maybe nine.
I was just lookin' into buyin' a
boat of my own and got drafted. My
given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
Bubba and Forrest shake hands.
BUBBA
People call me Bubba. Just like one
of them redneck boys. Can you believe
that?
FORREST
My name's Forrest Gump. People call
me Forrest Gump.
FORREST (V.O.)
So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre,
Alabama, and his momma cooked shrimp.
Bubba's mother, a robust woman in a cook's uniform, carries
a bowl of shrimp into a dining room. She sets it down on a
table in front of a wealthy white man.
FORREST (V.O.)
And her momma before her cooked
shrimp.
SLAVERY)
Bubba's grandmother carries a bowl of shrimp into a dining
room. She sets it down on a table in front of a wealthy white
man.
FORREST (V.O.)
And her momma before her momma cooked
shrimp, too. Bubba's family knew
everything...
FORREST (V.O.)
...there was to know about the
shrimpin' business.
BUBBA
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimpin' business. Matter
of fact, I'm goin' into the shrimpin'
business for myself after I get out
the Army.
FORREST
Okay.
A DRILL SERGEANT is in Forrest's face as Forrest stands in
line with the other recruits.
DRILL SERGEANT
Gump! What's your sole purpose in
this Army?
FORREST
To do whatever you tell me, Drill
Sergeant!
DRILL SERGEANT
Godamnit, Gump! You're a goddamned
genius! That's the most outstanding
answer I've ever heard. You must
have a godamned I.Q. of a hundred
and sixty! You are godamned gifted,
Private Gump!
The Drill Sergeant moves down the line to the next man.
DRILL SERGEANT
Listen up, people...
FORREST (V.O.)
Now, for some reason, I fit in the
Army like one of them round pegs.
It's not really hard. You just make
your bed real neat and remember to
stand up straight.
DRILL SERGEANT
That is one very intelligent
individual! You lock your scuzzy
bodies up behind that private and do
exactly what he does and you will go
far in this man's army!
FORREST (V.O.)
And always answer every question
with "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"
DRILL SERGEANT
Is that clear?
FORREST & RECRUITS
Yes, Drill Sergeant!
ANOTHER DAY
The recruits are sitting at the base of their bunks assembling
their rifles. Bubba speaks to Forrest.
BUBBA
What you do is you just drag your
nets across the bottom. On a good
day, you can catch over a hundred
pounds of shrimp. If everything goes
all right, two men shrimpin' ten
hours, less what you spends on gas,
you can...
Forrest finishes assembling his rifle as the other recruits
are still working on theirs.
FORREST
Done, Drill Sergeant!
DRILL SERGEANT
Gump!
The Drill Sergeant rushes up to Forrest.
DRILL SERGEANT
Why did you put that weapon together
so quickly, Gump?
FORREST
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.
The Drill Sergeant looks at his stop watch.
DRILL SERGEANT
Jesus Christ! This is a new company
record. If it wouldn't be a waste of
such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd
recommended you for O.C.S., Private
Gump. You are gonna be a General
some day, Gump! Now, disassemble
your weapon and continue!
The Drill Sergeant walks away as Forrest begins to disassemble
his rifle. After the Drill Sergeant walks past Bubba, Bubba
looks up at Forrest. Bubba continues talking about shrimp in
his slow southern drawl.
BUBBA
Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is
the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue
it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute
it. There, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp
creole...
ANOTHER DAY
Bubba and Forrest shine their boots.
BUBBA
...shrimp gumbo, panfried, deep fried,
stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper
shrimp...
ANOTHER DAY
Bubba and Forrest are on their hands and knees as they scrub
the floor with toothbrushes.
BUBBA
...shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp
salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp
burger, shrimp sandwich... that's,
that's about it.
NIGHT
Bubba lies in his bunk and looks up quietly.
FORREST (V.O.)
Nighttime in the Army is a lovely
time.
Forrest lies in his bunk and looks up.
FORREST (V.O.)
We'd lay there in our bunks, and I'd
miss my momma. And I'd miss Jenny.
A young private tosses a Playboy magazine onto Forrest.
YOUNG PRIVATE
Hey, Gump. Get a load of the tits on
her!
Forrest pick up the magazine and turns the page, revealing
Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all.
The pictorial is titled: "Girls of the South." Forrest looks
up with shock. He cranes his head up for a closer look.
FORREST (V.O.)
Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble over... some photos of
her in her college sweater. And she
was thrown out of school.
SONG
"My baby does the hanky-panky..."
Forrest, in his army uniform, steps into the foyer of the
club.
FORREST (V.O.)
But that wasn't a bad thing. Because
a man who owns a theater in Memphis,
Tennessee, saw those photo and offered
Jenny a job singing in a show. The
first chance I got, I took the bus
up to Memphis to see her perform in
that show.
EMCEE steps out onto the stage.
EMCEE
That was Amber, Amber Flame. Give
her a big hand, guys. Good job, Amber.
And now, for your listening and
viewing pleasure, direct from
Hollywood, California, our very own
beatnik beauty, let's give a big
round of applause to the luscious
Bobbie Dylan.
CROWD
Bobbie... Bobbie...
The emcee walks back off the stage and the curtain opens,
revealing Jenny as she sits on a stool on the stage. She
holds a guitar up and begins to play. She is topless.
JENNY
(sings)
"Yes, and how many seas must the
white dove said, before she sleeps
in the sand."
FORREST (V.O.)
Her dream had come true. She was a
folk singer.
JENNY
(sings)
"Yes, how many times must the
cannonballs fly before they're forever
banned."
MAN #1
You gotta lose the guitar, darling.
MAN #2
Hey, come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up now.
MAN #3
Hey, somebody ought to get her a
harmonica.
The men laugh.
JENNY
(sings)
"The answer, my friend is blowing in
the wind. The answer is blowing in...
MAN #
...skin, honey. This isn't Captain
Kangaroo.
MEN
Yeah! Come on!
Man #5 reaches up and tries to stick some money in Jenny's
shoe.
MAN #5 :
Hey, honey, I got something here for
you.
Jenny kicks his hand. He yells angrily as he sits back down,
then tosses his drink on her.
MAN #5
Goddamnit!
JENNY
Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk! I'm singing a
song here. Polly, get out here!
MAN #
Hey, show us some stuff, honey!
JENNY
Shut up! Oh, shut up!
Forrest walks up to Man #5 and grabs him and tosses him down
on the ground. Man #4 tries to grab Forrest, but Forrest
shoves him down too.
JENNY
Forrest, what are you doing here?
What are you doing?
Forrest climbs up onto the stage and picks Jenny up, guitar
and all, and carries her.
FORREST
Come on.
JENNY
What are you doing? Forrest, let me
down!
Jenny struggles and frees herself from Forrest. Forrest steps
back in surprise. Jenny shoves the guitar at Forrest. Jenny
walks off as Forrest holds the guitar. He follows after her.
Forrest holds two ice cream cones in his hands as he is
wheeled on a rolling stretcher.
FORREST (V.O.)
...is the ice cream. They gave me
all the ice cream I could eat. And
guess what. A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.
Forrest, lying on his stomach, is wheeled to his bed.
Forrest's butt sticks up and is bandaged. Forrest looks at
Lt. Dan lying on the bed. Forrest holds out an ice cream
cone for Lt. Dan.
FORREST
Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice
cream. Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.
Lt. Dan, annoyed, takes the ice cream cone and drops it into
his bed pan. Forrest slides himself onto his bed. A NURSE
reaches toward Lt. Dan.
MALE NURSE
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.
The male nurse places Lt. Dan's hands on a pull-up bar, then
picks up Lt. Dan, whose legs have been amputated.
MALE NURSE
Harper...
Another nurse wheels the rolling bed under Lt. Dan. The male
nurse sets Lt. Dan down on the rolling bed. Forrest looks up
at Lt. Dan as he is wheeled away. A soldier reads the names
from a pile of letters.
SOLDIER
Cooper, Larson, Webster, Gump, Gump...
FORREST
I'm Forrest Gump.
The soldier hands Forrest a large pile of letters.
"Undeliverable as addressed. No forwarding order on file."
Jenny Curran Rural Route 2 Greenbow, Ala. 39902 Forrest looks
down at the pile of letters.
A group of wounded soldiers hang out in the hospital,
recuperating. Forrest sits and watches "Gomer Pyle" on the
television.
SOLDIER
Gump, how can you watch that stupid
shit? Turn it off!
ANNOUNCER
From the D.M.Z. to the Delta, you
are tuned to the American Forces
Vietnam Network. This is Channel 6,
Saigon.
Forrest turns the TV off and he is hit on the back of the
head by a ping-pong ball.
SOLDIER
Good catch, Gump. You know how to
play this?
Forrest shakes his head.
SOLDIER
Come on, let me show you. Here.
The wounded ping-pong player hands Forrest a paddle. Forrest
and the wounded ping-pong player step toward the ping-pong
table.
SOLDIER
Now the secret to this game is, no
matter what happens, never, never
take your eye off the ball.
He holds the ball up and moves it back and forth. Forrest
keeps his eyes on the ball.
SOLDIER
All right...
The wounded ping-pong player tosses the ball down onto the
table. Forrest begins to hit the ball back to the other
player.
FORREST (V.O.)
For some reason, ping pong came very
natural to me.
SOLDIER
See, any idiot can play.
FORREST (V.O.)
So I started playing it all the time.
Forrest hits ping-pong balls.
FORREST (V.O.)
I played ping-pong even when I didn't
have anyone to play ping-pong with.
The balls at land in a bed pan positioned on a chair. A group
of wounded soldier sit and watch Forrest play with himself.
Forrest hits two balls at a time against the opposite side
of the table.
FORREST (V.O.)
The hospital's people said it made
me look like a duck in water, whatever
that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would
come and watch me play.
Lt. Dan stares out the window. Forrest lies in his bed asleep.
A hand reaches and grabs him.
FORREST (V.O.)
I played ping-pong so much, I even
played it in my sleep.
Lt. Dan pulls Forrest to the floor, and holds Forrest down.
LT. DAN
Now, you listen to me. We all have a
destiny. Nothing just happens, it's
all part of a plan. I should have
died out there with my men! But now,
I'm nothing but a goddamned cripple!
A legless freak. Look! Look! Look at
me! Do you see that? Do you know
what it's like not to be able to use
your legs?
FORREST
Well... Yes, sir, I do.
LT. DAN
Did you hear what I said? You cheated
me. I had a destiny. I was supposed
to die in the field! With honor!
That was my destiny! And you cheated
me out of it! You understand what
I'm saying, Gump? This wasn't supposed
to happen. Not to me. I had a destiny.
I was Lieutenant Dan Tyler.
FORREST
Yo-You're still Lieutenant Dan.
Lt. Dan looks at Forrest, lets go of Forrest and rolls.
Lt. Dan sits up as Forrest looks at him.
LT. DAN
Look at me. What am I gonna do now?
What am I gonna do now?
Forrest plays ping-pong by himself. An OFFICER walks up to
him.
OFFICER
P.F.C. Gump?
Forrest immediately grabs the ball and places it down on the
table under its paddle. Stands at attention.
FORREST
Yes, sir!
OFFICER
As you were.
The officer holds up an envelope.
OFFICER
Son, you've been awarded the Medal
of Honor.
Forrest steps up to Lt. Dan's bed.
FORREST
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan, they
want to give me a me...
Forrest stops in mid-sentence as he looks down at the bed. A
heavily bandaged soldier with bloodstains lies there. Forrest
turns and look at the NURSE.
FORREST
Ma'am, what'd they do with Lieutenant
Dan?
NURSE
They sent him home.
FORREST (V.O.)
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.
ANCHORMAN
(on T.V.)
The ceremony was kicked off with a
candid speech by the President
regarding the need for further
escalation of the war in Vietnam.
President Johnson awarded four Medals
of Honor to men from each of the
Armed Services.
The television reveals Forrest as he is awarded the Medal of
Honor by President Johnson.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON
America owes you a debt of gratitude,
son.
Color footage revealing President Johnson as he places the
award around Forrest's neck and shakes hands.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON
I understand you were wounded. Where
were you hit?
FORREST
In the buttocks, sir.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON
Oh, that must be a sight.
President Johnson leans and whispers into Forrest's ear.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON
I'd kinda like to see that.
The television revealing Forrest as he drops his pants, bends
over and shows the bullet wound on his bare buttocks.
President Johnson looks down and smiles. The three men in
the barber shop look up in disbelief. Mrs. Gump looks up in
shock.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON
Goddamn, son.
Forrest stands at an open window and looks at the White House.
FORREST (V.O.)
...to some of her new friends.
A Black Panther, named RUBEN, steps over and pulls the shades
down.
RUBEN
Shut that blind, man. And get your
white ass away from that window.
Don't you know we in war here?
Another Black Panther named MASAI grabs Forrest and pats him
down.
JENNY
Hey man, he's cool. He's cool. He's
one of us. He's one of us.
MASAI
Let me tell you about us.
WESLEY
Where the hell have you been?
JENNY
I ran into a friend.
MASAI
Our purpose here is to protect our
black leaders from the racial
onslaught of the pig who wishes to
brutalize our black leaders, rape
our women, and destroy our black
communists.
BLACK PANTHER
Masai, phone. Talk to these guys.
WESLEY
Who's the baby killer?
JENNY
This is my good friend I told you
about. This is Forrest Gump. Forrest,
this is Wesley. Wesley and I live
together in Berkeley, and he's the
president of the Berkeley chapter of
S.D.S.
MASAI
Let me tell you something else.
WESLEY
I want to talk to you.
JENNY
Okay, but...
WESLEY
No. Now! Goddammit!
MASAI
We are here to offer protection and
help for all of those who need our
help, because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam. Yes,
we are against any war where black
soldiers are sent to the front line
to die for a country that hates them.
Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers go to fight and come
to be brutalized and killed in their
own communities as they sleep in
their beds at night. Yes, we are
against all these racists and imperial
dog acts.
JENNY
You are a fucking asshole!
Wesley hits Jenny across the face. Slow motion -- Jenny falls
back. Slow motion -- Forrest steps forward with rage.
Slow motion -- Wesley turns and looks at Forrest. Forrest
tackles Wesley and slams him onto a table. Jenny turns and
looks as Masai pulls out a gun.
JENNY
Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest!
Stop it!
Jenny rushes over to Forrest and pulls Forrest off Wesley.
JENNY
Stop it!
Jenny tries to help Wesley as he moans on the floor. Wesley
knocks Jenny's hand away. He gets up, holding his bloody
lip.
WESLEY
Oh, God. I shouldn't have brought
you here. I should have known it was
just gonna be some bullshit hassle.
FORREST
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.
JENNY
Come on, Forrest.
Jenny steps out the door as Forrest picks up his hat.
FORREST
Sorry I had a fight in the middle of
your Black Panther party.
The group of Black Panthers glare at Forrest. Forrest turns
and walks out the room.
A footage of Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon on
television.
NEIL ARMSTRONG
That's one small step for man, one
giant leap for mankind. The, uh, the
surface is fine and powdery. I can,
I can pick it up loosely.
Forrest demonstrates a ping-pong to some wounded vets.
FORREST (V.O.)
I thought I was going back to Vietnam,
but instead, they decided the best
way for me to fight communists was
to play ping-pong. So I was in the
Special Services, traveling around
the country cheering up all them
wounded veterans and showing them
how to play...
BUS STOP - PRESENT - DAY
Forrest looks at a man.
FORREST
...ping-pong. I was so good that
some years later...
A television shows DICK CLARK as he emcees the Times Square
New York Eve celebration.
DICK CLARK
We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.
This is the site of the old Astor
Hotel. Down below us, well over a
hundred thousand people are milling
about, cheering with horns and
whistles and hats...
LT. DAN
What the hell's in Bayou La Batre?
FORREST
Shrimpin' boats.
LT. DAN
Shrimpin' boats? Who gives a shit
about shrimpin' boats?
FORREST
I gotta buy me one of them shrimpin'
boats as soon as I have some money.
I made me a promise to Bubba in
Vietnam, that as soon as the war was
over, we'd go in partners. He'd be
the captain of the shrimpin' boat
and I'd be his first mate. But now
that he's dead, that means that I
gotta be the captain.
LT. DAN
A shrimp boat captain.
FORREST
Yes, sir. A promise is a promise,
Lieutenant Dan.
LT. DAN
Now hear this! Private Gump here is
gonna be a shrimp boat captain. Well,
I tell you what, Gilligan, the day
that you are a shrimp boat captain,
I will come and be your first mate.
FORREST
Okay.
LT. DAN
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.
Two sleazy women, named LENORE and CARLA, walk up to Lt.
Dan.
LENORE
Danny, what are you complaining about?
CARLA
What are you doing, huh?
LENORE
Mr. Hot Wheels. Who's your friend?
FORREST
My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.
LT. DAN
This is Cunning Carla, and Long-Limbs
Lenore.
Carla puts a "Happy New Year" crown on Lt. Dan's head. Lenore
fixes her makeup.
CARLA
So where you been, baby-cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately. You
know, you should have been here for
Christmas 'cause Tommy bought a round
on the house and gave everybody a
turkey sandwich.
LT. DAN
Well, well, I had, uh, company.
LENORE
Hey, hey! We was, we was just there.
That's at Times Square.
Lenore leans and speaks into Forrest's ear.
LENORE
Don't you just love New Year's? You
get to start all over.
CARLA
Hey, Lenore.
LENORE
Everybody gets a second chance.
FORREST (V.O.)
It's funny, but in the middle of all
that fun, I began to think about
Jenny.
DICK CLARK
(on television)
...getting wild out there. It's
beginning to...
The New Year's Eve celebration over the T.V.
DICK CLARK
(over television)
...pour here in Times Square. It's
been off-and-on all night, but these
people hang in there.
Jenny fills her bag with her belongings.
FORREST (V.O.)
Wondering how she was spending her
New Year's night out in California.
A man lies passed out on the bed. Jenny looks at her black
eye in a mirror, then leaves the apartment. The TV shows the
ball in Times Square.
CROWD
(over television)
The ball is lowered, lighting up a sign that reads "1972."
CROWD
(over television)
...1! Happy New Year!
The people in the bar cheer and kiss each other. They blow
horns and toss confetti into the air. Forrest looks around
as Carla and Lenore lean over and kiss him.
PATRONS
(sing)
"Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to mind...
FORREST
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!
PATRONS
(sing)
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and days of auld lang syne."
Carla removes her top and sits on top of Dan in his
wheelchair. They kiss and play around. Forrest sits in a
chair. Lenore leaps on him and begins to kiss Forrest. She
reaches down to Forrest's crotch. Forrest stands up nervously,
causing Lenore to fall down on the floor. Lenore stands up,
angry.
LENORE
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem? What's his
problem? Did you lose your pecker in
the war or something?
CARLA
What, is your friend stupid or
something?
LT. DAN
What did you say?
CARLA
I said, is your friend stupid or
something?
LT. DAN
Hey! Don't call him stupid!
Lt. Dan throws Carla back onto the bed.
CARLA
Don't push me like that!
LENORE
Hey, don't you push her!
LT. DAN
You shut up! Don't you ever call him
stupid!
CARLA
What's the matter, baby? Why you
treating me like shit?
LT. DAN
Get the hell out of here!
LENORE
You stupid gimp. You belong in
"Ripley's Believe It Or Not."
LT. DAN
Get the hell out of here! Go on!
LENORE
You should be in a side show!
LT. DAN
Go on! Get out of here! Get out of
here!
LENORE
You big loser!
CARLA
Come on, Lenore. We don't need this
shit!
LENORE
You're so pathetic.
LT. DAN
Get out of here!
Lt. Dan falls out of his wheelchair and lands down on the
floor. Carla and Lenore laugh as they leave the apartment.
CARLA
You retard!
LENORE
You loser! You freak!
Forrest tries to help Lt. Dan. Lt. Dan pushes Forrest away.
LT. DAN
No!
Forrest steps back as Lt. Dan flips back over, then pulls
himself back up onto his wheelchair. He breathes heavily.
FORREST
I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's
Eve party, Lieutenant Dan. She tastes
like cigarettes.
FORREST (V.O.)
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's
some things you just can't change.
He didn't want to be called crippled,
just like I didn't want to be called
stupid.
LT. DAN
Happy New Year.
A plaque, presented to Forrest, reads "Presented to Forrest
Gump, member of the United States table tennis team as player
of the year for 1971. President NIXON holds the plaque.
FORREST (V.O.)
Only this time they didn't get us
rooms in a real fancy hotel.
PRESIDENT NIXON
So are you enjoying yourself in our
national capital, young man?
FORREST
Yes, sir.
PRESIDENT NIXON
Well, where are you staying?
FORREST
It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
PRESIDENT NIXON
Oh, no, no, no, no. I know of a much
nicer hotel. It's brand-new. Very
modern. I'll have my people take
care of it for you.
Forrest speaks on the phone.
SECURITY GUARD
Security, Frank Wills.
Forrest steps over to a window. Flashlights are moving around
in an office across from Forrest's room.
FORREST
Yeah, sir, you might want to send a
maintenance man over to that office
across the way. The lights are off,
and they must be looking for the
fuse box or something, 'cause them
flashlights they're, they're keeping
me awake.
SECURITY GUARD
Okay, sir. I'll check it out.
FORREST
Thank you.
SECURITY GUARD
No problem.
FORREST
Good night.
SECURITY GUARD
Good night.
Forrest hangs up the phone. The camera tilts down, revealing
the hotel stationary, which reads "The Watergate Hotel."
President Nixon makes a resignation speech on TV.
PRESIDENT NIXON
(over television)
Therefore, I shall resign the
Presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
The television cuts to a shot of President Nixon standing
outside Air Force One with his hands in the peace sign.
PRESIDENT NIXON
(over television)
Vice President Ford will be sworn in
as President at that hour in this
office. As I recall the high hopes
for America with which we began this
second term, I feel a great sadness
that I will not be here in this
office...
Forrest is playing ping-pong by himself at the gymnasium. An
officer steps up to him.
OFFICER
Sergeant Gump!
FORREST
Yes, sir!
OFFICER
As you were. I have your discharge
papers. Your service is up, son.
The officer hands Forrest an envelope, then walks away.
FORREST
Does this mean I can't play ping
pong no more?
OFFICER
For the Army it does.
FORREST (V.O.)
And just like that, my service in
the United States Army was over. So
I went home.
Forrest takes his paddle and runs out of the gymnasium.
Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk into the house.
MRS. GUMP
Louise, he's here. He's here,
everybody.
FORREST (V.O.)
Now, when I got home, I had no idea
that Momma had had all sorts of
visitors.
In the house are stacks of ping-pong paddles and life-sized
cardboard cutouts of Forrest playing ping-pong. The name on
the ping-pong paddles boxes reads: "Gump-Mao table tennis."
MRS. GUMP
We've had all sorts of visitors,
Forrest. Everybody wants you to use
their ping-pong stuff. One man even
left a check for twenty-five thousand
dollars if you'd be agreeable to
saying you like using their paddle.
FORREST
Oh, Momma. I only like using my own
paddle. Hi, Miss Louise.
LOUISE
Hey, Forrest.
MRS. GUMP
I know that. I know that. But it's
twenty-five thousand dollars, Forrest.
I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.
Oh, you look good, Forrest. You look
real good.
FORREST (V.O.)
That Momma, she sure was right. It's
funny how things work out.
Disco lights flash and people dance. A guy asks a girl to
dance.
GIRL
Okay.
Jenny sits at a table with some other people. She is snorting
cocaine.
FORREST (V.O.)
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny in a
long while. But...
Drug paraphernalia and a large wad of cash are spread out on
a table. A man drops a syringe on the table. He reaches over
and touches Jenny. She is pale with dark lines under her
eyes.
Jenny smears some lines of cocaine on a mirror. She looks at
herself in the mirror.
The all-black gospel choir sings and claps their hands.
FORREST (V.O.)
So I went to church every Sunday...
Lt. Dan is sitting in his chair at the back of the church.
He takes swigs from a liquor bottle.
FORREST (V.O.)
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too.
Though I think he left the praying
up to me.
An ANCHORMAN over TV, is standing in front of a pier.
ANCHORMAN
(over television)
Hurricane Carmen came through here
yesterday...
ANCHORMAN
...has fallen victim to Carmen and
has been left in utter ruin. Speaking
with local officials, this reporter
has learned, in fact, only one
shrimping boat actually survived the
storm.
Forrest's boat comes down the river.
MRS. GUMP
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest!
FORREST (V.O.)
After that, shrimpin' was easy.
FORREST'S BOAT - DAY
Lt. Dan and Forrest empty their net. A huge catch of shrimp
falls onto the deck. Lt. Dan opens another big catch.
Another catch drops open on top of yet another huge catch.
Forrest and Lt. Dan smile.
FORREST (V.O.)
And since people still needed them
shrimps for shrimp cocktails and
barbecues and all...
Forrest opens the door, the doctor stands next to Mrs. Gump
in bed.
MRS. GUMP
Hi, Forrest.
DOCTOR
I'll see you tomorrow.
MRS. GUMP
Oh, all right.
The doctor looks down at Forrest's legs.
DOCTOR
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?
The doctor leaves and closes the door. Forrest takes off his
hat and steps over to her.
FORREST
What's the matter, Momma?
MRS. GUMP
I'm dyin', Forrest. Come on in, sit
down over here.
FORREST
Why are you dyin', Momma?
MRS. GUMP
It's my time. It's just my time. Oh,
now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.
Death is just a part of life. It's
something we're all destined to do.
I didn't know it, but I was destined
to be your momma. I did the best I
could.
FORREST
You did good, Momma.
MRS. GUMP
Well, I happened to believe you make
your own destiny. You have to do the
best with what God gave you.
FORREST
What's my destiny, Momma?
MRS. GUMP
You're gonna have to figure that out
for yourself. Life is a box of
chocolates, Forrest. You never know
what you're gonna get.
FORREST (V.O.)
Momma always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.
MRS. GUMP
I will miss you, Forrest.
FORREST (V.O.)
She had got the cancer and died on a
Tuesday. I bought her a new hat with
little flowers on it.
FORREST (V.O.)
Now, Momma said there's only so much
fortune a man really needs...
A door opens as a white woman serves Bubba's mom some shrimp.
FORREST (V.O.)
She didn't have to work in nobody's
kitchen no more.
MRS. BLUE
Smells wonderful!
Jenny lies asleep in bed.
FORREST (V.O.)
Maybe it was because she had nowhere
else to go. Or maybe it was because
she was so tired, because she went
to bed and slept and slept like she
hadn't slept in years. It was
wonderful having her home.
Jenny sits by the vase of flowers and look out the window.
FORREST (V.O.)
Every day I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her.
The Statue of Liberty is shown on the TV. Fireworks go off.
Forrest and Jenny are watching the 4th of July celebration
on TV.
ANNOUNCER
(over television)
And this Fourth is witnessing one of
the largest fireworks displays in
the nation's two-hundred year
history...
JENNY
You done watching it?
FORREST
Mm-hmm.
ANNOUNCER
(over television)
...here in New York Harbor. After
the spectacular display of tall ships
earlier, the Statue of Liberty...
Jenny stands up and kisses Forrest on the cheek.
JENNY
I'm going to bed.
Jenny turns off the TV and walks outside. Forrest stands as
he puts down his Dr. Pepper. Jenny walks toward the stairs.
FORREST
Will you marry me? I'd make a good
husband, Jenny.
JENNY
You would, Forrest.
FORREST
But you won't marry me.
JENNY
You don't want to marry me.
FORREST
Why don't you love me, Jenny? I'm
not a smart man, but I know what
love is.
Forrest turns and walks toward the door. Jenny turns and
walks up the stairs. Forrest stands outside.
The cab drives away as Forrest is asleep in his bed. The
Congressional Medal lies on a table by a ping-pong paddle.
Forrest holds a glass of milk and wears his bathrobe. He
looks at the medal he had give to Jenny. Jenny's bed is made.
Forrest stands in the doorway looking at the room and bed
where Jenny had been.
The three men sit as they watch the television. Forrest runs
through the main street of town.
NEWSCASTER
President Carter, suffering from
heat exhaustion fell into the arms
of security agents.
FORREST (V.O.)
And when I got there...
Jenny fills customer's coffee cups.
NEWSCASTER
Charles Cooper brings us this report.
NEWSMAN
For the fourth time on his journey
across America, Forrest Gump, a
gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, is
about to cross the Mississippi River
again today.
The TV shows Forrest runs across a bridge that reads
"Mississippi River."
JENNY
I'll be damned. Forrest...
Forrest sits eating a sandwich, watching the news of the
assassination attempt.
NEWSCASTER
...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin. The
President was shot in the chest and
the assailant was immediately tackled
by a half a dozen lawmen. As the
Presidential...
LOUISE
I picked up the mail.
FORREST
Oh, thank you, Miss, Miss Louise.
FORREST (V.O.)
One day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny...
Jenny opens the door.
JENNY
Hey! Forrest! How you doing?
FORREST
Hi.
JENNY
Come in. Come in.
FORREST
I got your letter.
JENNY
Oh, I was wondering about that.
Jenny shuts the door. Forrest looks around.
FORREST
Is this your house?
JENNY
Yeah, it's messy right now. I just
got off work.
FORREST
It's nice. You got air conditioning.
Forrest hands Jenny the box of chocolates.
FORREST
Ah...
JENNY
Thank you.
FORREST
I ate some.
Jenny picks up a scrapbook and turns the pages.
JENNY
Hey, I kept, I kept a scrapbook of
your, of your clippings and
everything. There you are. This, I
got your running.
FORREST
I ran a long way. For a long time.
JENNY
There. Listen, Forrest. I don't know
how to say this. Um, I just... I
want to apologize for anything that
I ever did to you, 'cause I was messed
up for a long time, and...
There is a knock at the door. LYNN MARIE enters as she opens
the door.
LYNN MARIE
Yoo-hoo.
JENNY
Hey.
LYNN MARIE
Hi.
Jenny grabs a young boy.
JENNY
Hey, you. This is an old friend from
Alabama.
LYNN MARIE
Oh, how do you do?
JENNY
Ah, listen, next week my schedule
changes, so I'll be able to... but
thanks for picking up.
LYNN MARIE
No problem. Got to go, Jen. I'm double
parked.
JENNY
Okay.
Lynn Marie closes the door and waves bye to Forrest.
LYNN MARIE
Bye.
JENNY
Thanks. This is very good friend,
Mr. Gump. Can you say hi to him?
LITTLE BOY
Hello, Mr. Gump.
FORREST
Hello.
LITTLE BOY
Now, can I go watch TV now?
JENNY
Yes, you can. Just keep it low.
The little boy runs into other room and picks up TV remote
control.
FORREST
You're a momma, Jenny.
JENNY
I'm a momma. His name is Forrest.
FORREST
Like me.
JENNY
I named him after his Daddy.
FORREST
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?
JENNY
You're his daddy, Forrest.
Forrest continues to stare at Forrest Jr. Forrest then looks
frightened and starts to back away.
JENNY
Hey, Forrest, look at me. Look at
me, Forrest. There's nothing you
need to do, okay? You didn't do
anything wrong. Okay?
Jenny turns and looks at Forrest Jr. in the other room.
JENNY
Isn't he beautiful?
FORREST
He's the most beautiful thing I've
ever seen. But... is, is he smart,
or is he...
JENNY
He's very smart. He's one of the
smartest in his class.
Forrest breathes deep. He looks at Jenny, then at Forrest
Jr.
JENNY
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.
Forrest walks into the room and sits down next to Forrest
Jr. "Sesame Street" is on the TV.
BERT
Oh, great.
ERNIE
Hey, Bert, can you give me a hand?
BERT
A hand? Well, yeah, what do you want,
Ernie?
FORREST
What are you watching.
FORREST JR.
Bert and Ernie.
ERNIE
Well, it's the first stage. Bert.
It's planning to write a story, Bert.
I have pencils right here to write
with, Bert. Now, we got, uh, paper.
I'll take that paper, Bert. See, we
have the paper to write on.
Forrest steps into Jenny's bedroom. He carries a tray with
breakfast on it. Forrest looks at Jenny as she sleeps.
Slowly she wakes up and looks at Forrest.
FORREST
Hey.
JENNY
Hey.
Forrest sets the tray down next to Jenny as she sits up in
bed. Forrest opens a window, then sits down next to the bed.
JENNY
Hey, Forrest, were you scared in
Vietnam?
FORREST
Yes. Well, I, I don't know.
Forrest looks at Jenny. Jenny looks out the window.
JENNY
I wish I could have been there with
you.
FORREST
You were.
Jenny reaches over and takes Forrest's hand.
JENNY
I love you.
FORREST (V.O.)
You died on a Saturday morning.
Forrest Jr. reads a book to Forrest sitting next to him.
FORREST JR.
(reading)
"But he wasn't quite sure. Everywhere
they went, the new guests...
FORREST (V.O.)
About to start school again soon. I
make his breakfast, lunch, and
dinner...
