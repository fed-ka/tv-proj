RAE is naked.
Wrapped around her shoulders is a loose-knit spread that
conceals her slender form. She is in her 20's: a strawberry
blond, with cinnamon freckles spotted across her pale skin.
She is beautiful without trying.
She stares at the distant trees. This is the South; the small
town of FISHERVILLE, TENNESSEE.
Soon Rae will be alone.
CUT TO:
Ronnie places his duffle bag in Gill's truck. Rae begins to
cough.
GILL
You sick?
Rae doesn't answer.
Gill backs away, allowing Ronnie and Rae some privacy. The
two lovers stare into each others eyes and then embrace.
Rae peeks over Ronnie's shoulder at Gill with an expression
of dread. Anger seizes her.
RAE
This ain't gonna work.
RONNIE
Rae...
RAE
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout
it when you and I know this ain't
gonna work.
RONNIE
(holds her face in
his hands)
Rae don't do this now...
RAE
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
RONNIE
Rae!
Silence. Rae melts. Tears stream down her face.
RONNIE
(reaches in his pocket)
Look it. I got somethin' for us.
This is gonna help, okay.
GILL
You gonna miss your bus.
Ronnie removes a small digital watch and fastens it around
her wrist.
RONNIE
This watch here is gonna beep at
midnight. Every night. That's when
it comes up on you the hardest, right?
Ronnie holds out his own wrist to show her his identical
watch.
RONNIE
And wherever I'm at, my watch'll
beep, too. We'll be thinkin' bout
each other at the same time. Wherever
we are.
Rae is shaking. He grips her by the back of her neck and
pushes their faces inches away. Eye to eye.
RONNIE
I gotta believe we can do this or I
ain't gonna make it, Rae.
Rae sees the fear in his eyes. She swallows her own anxiety
and nods.
RAE
Okay... Okay.
They kiss passionately.
RONNIE
I love you.
Afraid of his swelling emotion, Ronnie quickly breaks away
from her.
Rae watches as her love leaves in Gill's pick-up. Compelled
to follow, she absently walks after the truck, down the gravel
drive.
She stops. Silence. She is alone.
An intense wave of sorrow hits, like a kick to her gut. She
gasps for breath as she struggles to hold back the flood of
her tears.
Rae drops to her knees, right there in the gravel drive. Her
hair falls in front of her face, masking her grief.
Her shoulders shudder.
Her middle finger begins to scratch at her thigh repeatedly --
a nervous habit that has always accompanied this burning
sensation that consumes her.
RAE
Shit.
Tears come to her. She's not going to be able to stop it.
RAE
Goddammit, Ronnie...
(shouting in
frustration)
GODDAMMIT!
Rae is gripping the watch around her wrist for comfort. Her
breathing is already out of her control. The dizziness is
already upon her. The familiar burning.
She inhales in gasps, rocking back and forth on her knees.
The late morning cicadas chirp in an undulating frenzy.
RAE
(shaking her head)
Mm-mm
(meaning "no")
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
The scratching at her leg leaves a red mark. She is dizzy
with anxiety. Her teeth are clenched, her face is flush.
RAE
MM-MM! MM-MM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
CUT TO:
Walking with his hands shoved deep into his pockets, wearing
his only suit and tie, is LAZARUS WOODS (LAZ). He is in his
late fifties, black, a strong face under his old fedora. He
stares across the street into Dunn's Cafe.
ROSE WOODS, black, early forties, stands in the cafe. She
looks confident and resolute in her new green skirt.
A brown Delta Olds pulls up into a parking space in front of
Laz. Stepping out is REVEREND R.L., Laz's longtime friend.
He is also black and in his late fifties.
R.L.
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are
you?
(no answer)
Nothing a man can do when a woman
make up her mind.
LAZARUS
I never laid a hand on her in anger.
Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'.
But this business got me wonderin'
what a good shake and slap would do
for her.
R.L.
That kind of talk is between us.
Don't you go in there with that shit
on your tongue.
LAZARUS
I didn't start this, R.L.
Laz tries to stop his lip from quivering: the man is hurting.
R.L.
You wanna pray with me 'fore you go
in? Laz?
(R.L. touches Laz's
arm and bows his
head)
Heavenly Father...
CUT TO:
Rae is prancing up the walkway on the square. Two young men
dressed for construction pass Rae.
MAN
It's already noon, Rae. You think
that skirt should still be on?
RAE
(flips them off)
If it weren't you could kiss my rebel
cootch, ya faggot.
The men keep walking as Rae coughs. She turns toward the
Fisherville Grocery.
SANDY
Cough drops or condoms?
Rae stops in her tracks, looking up at her estranged mother,
SANDY, smoking a cigarette outside the grocery store. Sandy
has bleached hair with dark roots. She is in her late-forties:
once a sexy girl, now she's lost all her tread.
RAE
(surprised to see her)
Didn't know you was workin' here
now?
SANDY
I just like dressin' up in these
goddamn blue vests.
(takes a drag)
Your money ticket get shipped today?
Rae walks away -- deeply affected by Sandy's presence.
SANDY
(calling after her)
You let me know if I can be of any
assistance.
CUT TO:
Laz drives an old green Ford pick-up. He pulls the truck up
to the front of the feed store and kills the engine.
LINCOLN, a 13-year-old black boy, comes out of the open
loading door.
LINCOLN
You won't at the square this mornin'.
LAZARUS
Get me ten bags of mulch.
LINCOLN
Yes'sir.
Lincoln runs off. Laz yanks off his black tie.
Lincoln slaps the last bag of mulch into the bed of Laz's
truck. Laz hands Lincoln a twenty.
LAZARUS
Keep the change on that.
LINCOLN
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.
(makes change)
You wanna tip me, best do it in butter
beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a
yours, none of that store-bought
junk. That's what she said.
Laz smiles. He takes the change. Climbs in his truck.
LAZARUS
Alright, Lincoln. You come on by,
I'll load you up.
CUT TO:
Lazarus steers his tractor toward his small home in a sea of
lush green kudzu. He kills the engine and looks beyond the
nose of his tractor. He lights a cigarette. Below the nose
is the head of a rose garden with a painted sign under it:
Rose's Roses.
Laz inhales smoke and exhales hate. The tractor lunges
forward, trampling the garden, ripping the flowers to shreds.
CUT TO:
The bleachers are packed with three generations of fans and
family cheering their boys on the high school football field.
Rae is sitting with her two girlfriends, JESSE and KELL --
two girls who graduated five years ago.
JESSE
(hands Rae a beer)
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
RAE
It's so stupid. Says to me that he
don't want nothin' to do with no
military career. Says he wants to
move. Open up an auto shop with his
uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay.
How about now? Let's go.
KELL
He'd be good for that. Shit, Ronnie
knows cars.
RAE
He get stubborn. Starts talkin' 'bout
obligation and duty and all that...
Shit. I just want him to come home...
I swear, if somethin' happens to
him...
KELL
He fixed up that Buick for my uncle
Dale. He say it purrs like a kitten
every morning.
JESSE
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like
everybody over there is in the line
of fire with them Arabs blowin'
themselves up.
RAE
Can't be thinkin' bout him every
second of my day. I'll go outta my
gourd.
JESSE
Why should you waste your life waitin'
and wonderin'. Not like you're
married.
RAE
(takes a healthy swig)
I begged him not to go. And he did.
KELL
(screaming at the
field)
PUNT YOU FUCKERS!
CUT TO:
Dirty South rap pounds the ears from a hoopty Olds with a
backseat full of bass. Rae, Kell, and Jesse are walking up
to the rowdy party through the variety of parked cars.
A girl rushes past the trio, vomiting on herself as a friend
comes to her aid.
JESSE
These baby chicks just can't hold
their Jello shots. I'm tellin' ya.
CUT TO:
NIGHT
CLOSE ANGLES: We never quite see the whole of what is implied.
Rae's eyes, Jesse's mouth, a boy's shoulder.
The room is packed with bodies. Rae laughs with pleasure as
her eyes attempt to focus. The kid on top of her finishes
and rolls off.
JESSE
What's so funny?
Jesse is straddling a guy in an arm chair, Chinese-eyed and
bouncing. Rae tries to respond coherently as another football
player rolls her over on all fours and takes her from behind.
RAE
(laughing)
Oh... I'm just on a water bed... And
it's just... so... Goddamn... funny!
A few coughs. Rae focuses to see a younger guy sitting at
her eye level.
RAE
Hi.
BRYAN
Hey.
RAE
You ain't the kicker, are you?
BRYAN
No, ma'am.
RAE
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta
run the ball more. You get into a
kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
BRYAN
Can I put it in your mouth?
RAE
Okay.
CUT TO:
NIGHT
Lazarus's blues is all we hear as four guys chase Rae through
the woods. She is in her shirt and panties, wearing football
shoulder pads.
She is completely wasted. Lost. The ground rocks back and
forth with each step. Trees pass in a slow-motion haze.
LAZARUS
(singing)
Well I sure did shot my baby, but I
did it because she did me wrong.
Well I sure did shot my baby, but I
did it because she did me wrong.
You know the judge called it murder
now the penitentiary is my home.
Rae grips a tree to steady herself, but a team member tackles
her. The woods spin and distort as someone mounts her with
ease.
LAZARUS
(singing)
I loved that woman, she said she
didn't love no one but me.
I loved that woman, she said she
didn't love no one but me.
Rae smiles as she lifts her hand up to the stars, passing
the writhing back of the guy on top of her. If she could
just grab a star she would feel safe again.
She tries to snatch one. She can't. Her hand drops as the
boy stands and takes off after his friends tossing the
football.
Rae lies motionless on the ground.
LAZARUS
(singing)
Yeah but I caught my baby cheating.
CUT TO:
NIGHT
Rae is wasted. She is still wearing her shirt, panties and
shoulder pads as she steps over passed-out teenagers.
RAE
Jes? Jesse?
(trips over a sprinkler)
Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
GILL
Stop what?
Rae doesn't look up. The Coricidin is tripping her out.
RAE
(coughing)
The ground is... turnin' upside down.
I'm gonna...
(coughing)
I'm gonna fall off...
Gill reaches down and pulls off the shoulder pads. The
coughing fit passes.
RAE
Oh. That feels so much better.
CUT TO:
Gill's truck flies down the dark road.
From outside the steamed truck window, we see Gill beat Rae
repeatedly.
Silence.
GILL
(muffled from the
inside)
Get up! I ain't playin'! OPEN YOUR
GODDAMN EYES!
Silence.
He opens the truck door, fear in his eyes. Rae isn't moving.
Blood is on her face.
GILL
Oh, Jesus...
A hasty idea. He pushes her out of the truck. She falls to
the dark pavement in a tangle of her own limbs.
The door slams. Gill floors the gas. Rae lies motionless
alone under the stars.
Her watch alarm goes off: Beep-beep. Beep-beep. Beep-beep.
CUT TO:
The bus roars past. The red brake lights fade into night.
FADE TO BLACK:
Lazarus steps out onto his porch. He picks up the trash bags
full of Rose's things and walks down the gravel drive to the
road.
MORNING
Laz tosses the bags inside his trash cans.
He's really hung over this morning. His eyes squeeze shut,
he grips his neck in pain.
LAZARUS
Mmmmmmmmmm... Mm!
His eyes open. They remain fixed beyond us. The pain in his
face is replaced with grave confusion.
Rae lies on the side of the road.
Her T-shirt and panties are damp from the early morning mist,
her face caked with dried blood. Her skin is deathly white,
her mouth open, her eyes shut and swollen.
Lazarus carefully steps toward her. He leans down over her
face.
LAZARUS
Sweet... Jesus...
Rae coughs. Laz flinches.
CUT TO:
Laz's Ford roars down the shaded street towards town.
CUT TO:
Laz parks his truck in front of MACON DRUGS and heads inside.
An old black man named RED sits on a bench next to an older
white man in his early eighties holding a cane. RED is the
paid caretaker of MELVIN.
MELVIN
How's the squash this year?
LAZARUS
It's good, Mister Melvin. I'll bring
ya some.
Laz rushes inside.
Laz opens his truck door and stops. At the pool-hall across
the square, Laz sees a green Cutlass with chrome rims.
CUT TO:
Laz runs out of his own home, not even shutting the door
behind him. He gets half way down his drive, the Bible still
clutched in his hand. He stops.
In a panic, Laz opens his Bible, places it down on the drive,
face up, creating a barrier to evil. He hears a choking cough
inside the house. Rae is fighting for breath beyond the dark
door.
Silence. Laz reaches down and picks up his Bible.
A passage catches his eye. As he reads, the fear vanishes
from his face. His back straightens. His jaw tightens. He
looks back at his house, his faith is renewed.
CUT TO:
The cicadas sing in a rising chorus as the clouds above fade
from copper to crimson.
FADE TO BLACK.
Rae races outside, tripping down the front porch steps. She
looks off at the blaze in the squash field. She frantically
races toward the fire, the beeping increases.
RAE
Ronnie... RONNIE!
BEEP BEEP... BEEP BEEP... BEEP BEEP... BEEP BEEP...
At the center of the blaze is an upside down Humvee. To the
left of the vehicle, a few soldier's bodies lay scattered.
Rae's legs lose all strength, she collapses and crawls across
the squash plants.
A far away voice is heard over the roaring flames.
LAZARUS
Gal? Gal?
Rae crawls across a fallen soldier, following the sound of
Ronnie's alarm. She struggles to breathe, she almost faints.
She finds a soldier face down. With all her strength she
turns him over. It is Ronnie, wide-eyed and lifeless.
An awful groan comes out of Rae -- crippling sorrow. She
pulls on his vest trying to wake him.
RAE
(sobbing)
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
LAZARUS
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Rae looks up. The flaming humvee is gone. She is not pulling
on Ronnie's vest, but the tangled vines of a squash plant.
Laz stands at a safe distance, silhouetted in moonlight.
LAZARUS
You travelin' right now, gal. You
asleep and you don't even know it.
(extends his hand)
Now... come on inside with me.
Rae looks like a terrified child. Her eyes well with tears
as she shakes her head. Laz takes a step toward her.
RAE
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
LAZARUS
Come on, gal...
She turns and runs away as best she can. Laz chases after
her. He's much older than her and a bit slower, but her
balance betrays her.
Laz wraps his arms around her. Rae screams to the sky.
RAE
NO! NOOO! NOOOOOOOOOO!
And then, stillness. Rae lies limp in Laz's arms, unconscious.
He reaches down and lifts her wrist to his face. The green
screen of the digital watch pulsates with the alarm.
He pushes the side button. The beeping stops. Silence.
CUT TO:
Lazarus is bent over, harvesting his tomatoes.
LAZARUS
(singing to himself)
Tell me who's that writin'? John the
Revelator. Wrote the book of the
seven seals.
CUT TO:
The door slams against the house as Rae rushes out in her
wolf shirt and panties -- the chain trailing behind her.
RAE
(screaming)
HELP!
Laz watches as the coil unravels and snaps taut, yanking on
the old radiator.
Clank! The chain whips Rae down to the ground. Laz watches
as dust flies of the radiator with each tug.
RAE
SOMEBODY!
CLANK!
The fear in Laz's face is replaced with a grin as he watches
his radiator hold firm.
RAE
SOMEBODY HELP ME!
Outside, Rae bucks and screams, yanking on the chain like a
wild mustang. Her bare feet and legs are soiled with fresh
mud and grass as she claws at the ground.
Laz crosses to the radiator and pats it like a proud parent --
his wedding ring clicks against the iron.
LAZARUS
(to the radiator)
Ain't gonna be moved.
He steps outside with resolve and strength. He picks up the
chain and wraps it around his fist.
LAZARUS
GAL! I ain't gonna be moved on this!
Laz yanks her back, dragging her towards him. He grips the
taut chain with his other hand and yanks her closer.
RAE
LET ME GO!
LAZARUS
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't
gonna bend my will.
(pulls her closer)
Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.
(Pulls her again)
Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to
the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE
GENERATION.
Rae is spent. She turns to look at her captor as he wrangles
her back to the porch.
LAZARUS
Now you get up! And you get in my
house!
RAE
Or what?
Rae spits at Laz. Bad idea.
CUT TO:
They are both seated on the front porch with paper plates in
their laps. Laz watches with amusement as Rae tears into her
chicken and gobbles up the vegetables.
LAZARUS
I put some back ache into growin'
them greens. You should slow down
and see how they taste.
Rae remains under Lazarus' intense gaze as the cicadas sing.
CUT TO:
Rae stares off at orange clouds and purple sky. She takes a
step to her left, walking through the parallel rows of squash.
The chain gently rattles behind her. Laz has given her about
20 feet of slack. He holds the chain tight around his fist.
Rae grins, standing proud in her wolf shirt and panties.
RAE
You like this? Walkin' me through
this field like I's your mule?
LAZARUS
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need
to get your legs strong.
RAE
(sassy)
If I break one you gonna shoot me?
Rae teases Laz by adjusting her panties. She turns back to
the sunset and stretches.
CUT TO:
A train rumbles past in the blue hue of dawn.
Laz pulls his truck next to two other fruit and vegetable
vendors: ARCHIE and GENE.
Archie is an old black man in his early seventies. Gene is a
short white man closer to Laz's age.
GENE
There goes our fortune. We been doin'
good for ourselves since you been
away.
Laz sets up his folding table and uncovers his produce.
LAZARUS
Y'all know when Ella Mae's open up?
ARCHIE
You needin' to buy some pantyhose?
LAZARUS
Just some dresses.
Gene looks at Archie and shrugs.
CUT TO:
Laz opens his truck and waves goodbye to Old Red. Melvin is
holding a healthy squash.
RED
You gonna be on the square later on?
LAZARUS
Got all my honey-do's done with. I'm
headin' home.
RED
Stay cool. It's a hot one.
Laz pulls away in his truck and rounds the corner just as
R.L. crosses the street. He steps over to talk to Red.
R.L.
Hey, Red. Was that Laz just left?
RED
Yes'sir, Rev'rend.
CUT TO:
Lincoln walks down the porch steps and stops. Thinks.
SLAM! Rae shuts the door.
Laz steers his Ford truck up the drive and parks. He takes
his time getting out and removing the shopping bags. He opens
the door and goes inside.
His curses can be heard from outside.
LAZARUS
SHIT BOY! WHAT THE HELL YOU...!
Lincoln is tossed off the porch, clinging to his overalls.
LAZARUS
CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR ONE...
Tears and fear come to Lincoln as Laz steps out onto the
porch, fuming with rage.
Lincoln backs away expecting a good beating. He starts running
up the drive but stops as R.L.'s Olds rolls up the drive.
LAZARUS
Lincoln, come on back.
Lincoln darts past Laz and runs into the barn, clutching his
overalls. R.L. stops the car halfway down the drive and steps
out.
R.L.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run
off?
LAZARUS
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
R.L.
Why's his britches round his knees?
LAZARUS
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I
can't have nobody round my place.
R.L. starts walking up the drive.
R.L.
You get a call from Rose?
LAZARUS
This ain't got nothin' to do with
that woman. Just don't want nobody
around me now.
R.L.
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been
callin' the last few days.
R.L. stops in his tracks as Lazarus pulls out his hunting
rifle from the rack behind his seat in his truck.
R.L.
Goin' dove huntin'?
LAZARUS
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin'
this time.
R.L.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I
don't?
(LAZ CAN'T ANSWER)
Spell it out, Laz. Man big enough to
pull a gun best have a tongue in his
mouth if he ain't got a brain in his
head.
Laz is struggling. The rifle feels suddenly strange to him.
LAZARUS
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit
no more. I got my mind made up and I
ain't gonna be moved on this.
R.L.
(amused)
Ain't gonna be moved?
LAZARUS
Got no place for preachin' here. Not
now. So you do as I say...
R.L.
(still stepping closer)
Or what?
LAZARUS
I told you to TURN BACK!
R.L. pushes his chest up against the rifle and shouts back.
R.L.
YOU GO'ON AND SHOOT ME, KILLA!
Laz's heart is breaking. He is pointing a gun at his only
friend.
R.L. snatches the rifle out of Laz's hands.
R.L.
Ought'a stomp yo ass pointing this
at me.
(unloads the rifle)
Always gotta bring up the preachin'.
Like you just a sheep in my flock
and all I'm good for is poundin' on
a pulpit.
(gets in Laz's face)
Dammit, Laz... we may not be blood.
But we sucked off the same old nurse
since the day we was slapped on the
ass. And you gonna point a gun at
me?
A tear rolls down Laz's cheek. The shame is unbearable.
R.L.
If you in some trouble, than WE gonna
figure somethin' out. You and me.
(hands him a bandana)
Wipe your face!
Laz takes the bandana and wipes the tears away.
R.L.
Now... this got anything to do with
Rose?
(Laz shakes his head)
Then what?
CUT TO:
R.L. shakes his head as Laz follows him off the porch.
R.L.
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
LAZARUS
Man like you ought not take the Lord's
name like you just done.
R.L.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
LAZARUS
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I
found her beat. Left for dead. So I
brung her home.
R.L.
Laz, I know about that girl.
(beat)
Good number of this town's sinners
got my ear, you know.
(shakes his head)
Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs
and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
LAZARUS
I haven't laid a hand. On my life,
R.L., my wick is dry on this.
R.L.
You say she was beat on. You call
the sheriff on that?
LAZARUS
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out
here, alone, with a beaten, half
naked, white woman loves to fuck. I
been toe to toe with the law in this
town for no more than being black
and nearby.
R.L.
What's that chain around her for?
Laz briefly looks off at the barn, knowing Lincoln is there.
LAZARUS
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She
need to talk wit somebody with sense.
Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on
this gal all her days. And this is
how I'm handling it.
R.L.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS
HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
Silence.
LAZARUS
Go in and talk to her. Please.
R.L. nods. Lazarus smiles.
LAZARUS
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I
expect you to come.
R.L.
You mean with you and that woman
chained to ya radiator?
LAZARUS
You treat folks special when they
company. It's just supper, R.L.,
shit.
R.L.
One thing at a time, Laz.
Laz walks toward the barn and turns back to R.L..
LAZARUS
Watch y'self in there. That girl'll
jump on ya junk like a grasshopper.
Laz opens the door to his barn wide, allowing the afternoon
light to find Lincoln sitting on an old tire, weeping.
LAZARUS
Did I hurt'chu?
Lincoln shakes his head. Laz carefully sits next to him.
LAZARUS
What happened in there... that won't
your fault. Ain't a young man alive
could keep they britches on with
that girl being in heat like she is.
LINCOLN
Why she got a chain on her?
LAZARUS
That's between her and me. It's
private. And I don't want you goin'
off and tellin' ya daddy.
LINCOLN
(in a panic)
Please don't tell my daddy.
LAZARUS
My mouth is shut, boy. And that's
how we gonna keep it. Don't go
braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
Lincoln nods. Laz hands him the bandana R.L. gave him.
LAZARUS
So...
(a bonding smile)
That your first time?
LINCOLN
Yes'sir.
LAZARUS
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
Lincoln grins as he wipes the snot from his nose.
LAZARUS
Shit. My first time was with my second
cousin behind my uncle's barn. She
weighed two tons, if a pound. Could'a
done a lot better for myself. You
sho'nuf did.
A bus stops at the station. The doors swing open. A few
passengers exit the bus followed by Ronnie.
He is not wearing his uniform.
He drops his duffle bag and pops a few quarters in the phone.
He waits, allows the phone to ring.
RONNIE
(into the phone)
This is Ronnie again. Don't know if
you been gettin' my messages but...
I'm down at the bus station and...
(struggles)
I just need you come get me. You get
this message, I'm on the interstate
headin' downtown toward the square.
(sadness hits)
Rae. I really need you to... come
find me. Please.
Ronnie hangs up the phone. He remains motionless, fearful
and alone.
He picks up his duffle and walks down the interstate.
CUT TO:
Lincoln stands over the barbecue spraying lighter fluid over
the coals while R.L. peels back the corn husks.
LINCOLN
We gonna eat with her?
R.L.
That's what I was told.
LINCOLN
She still gonna have that chain on?
R.L.
Well... I'm working on that.
(trying to change the
subject)
So... what's goin' on in your life,
Lincoln?
LINCOLN
I ain't no virgin no more?
Lincoln tosses a match on the coals. They ignite with flame.
Ronnie is walking by the bar along the interstate. He stops
when he sees Gill's truck.
Gill's truck rounds the bend and up the gravel drive leading
up to Ronnie's trailer.
The headlights scan across the porch as Gill parks.
The front door burst open as Gill goes flying down the front
porch. Ronnie cocks a .45 and shoves it into his belt.
Ronnie pins Gill's elbow behind his back and retrieves the
keys from his front pocket.
GILL
You gonna steal my truck?
RONNIE
Make yourself at home. You done it
already.
Gill watches Ronnie tear down the drive in his own truck.
CUT TO:
Laz and R.L. are smoking. Laz smiles as he watches Lincoln
and Rae through the kitchen window as they wash dishes and
talk about football.
R.L.
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz.
Somethin' like this gets out, you
could land in a heap of trouble.
LAZARUS
I'm dealin' with what God put before
me.
R.L.
You believe He wants this? A woman
chained to ya radiator?
LAZARUS
Not like that.
R.L.
Then what?
LAZARUS
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to
each other.
Laz is silent.
R.L.
I can't leave unless I get your word.
Laz looks down at his shoes. He surrenders. He nods.
R.L.
Laz. I got some news you need to
hear. It's about Rose and your
brother.
(this is not easy for
R.L.)
She's pregnant. She gonna have a
baby.
(silence)
Her sister told my wife. You know
how them sewing circles go. Just a
matter of time till you got word.
Thought that's why you been keepin'
to yourself out here.
(Laz conceals his
pain)
I don't know how much of this is to
make her happy or to hurt you. But
it is what it is.
Laz struggles with his emotions. He turns to R.L. stone faced
and cold.
LAZARUS
I'm through with them both.
CUT TO:
Laz and Rae wave to Lincoln as he climbs into R.L.'s car.
They pull away, up the drive, and disappear into the night.
The cicadas sing as the two stand in silence: Rae, at peace,
feeling genuine contentment; while Laz looks lost in silent
pain.
RAE
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
LAZARUS
You drink whiskey?
CUT TO:
Laz's truck pulls into his usual spot on the square. Rae is
riding shotgun.
RAE
Where you gonna be?
LAZARUS
Right here. Be here all afternoon.
(waits)
You ready for this?
RAE
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff,
like make-up and... stuff.
Rae looks out the window, a touch of fear.
LAZARUS
This town ain't goin' nowhere. You
take the time you need.
They both step out of the truck. Gene and Archie watch Rae's
ass as she walks by. They then look back at Laz, incredulous.
LAZARUS
Friend of mine.
CUT TO:
Laz is selling vegetables to a young woman. He is unaware
that Angela has moved up behind him, grinning, carrying a
small basket.
ANGELA
I bet you have loyal customers.
LAZARUS
(turns and grins)
You liked what I brung ya?
ANGELA
Been eatin' like a princess all week.
Even got enough for us to take a
picnic under the gazebo.
LAZARUS
That'd be nice.
ANGELA
I put on the lotion you got me. Can
you smell it?
Angela steps forward and pulls away her hair from her neck.
She cranes, offering her neck for Laz to smell.
LAZARUS
(smells)
That's nice, too.
CUT TO:
Laz and Angela are seated next to each other under the gazebo.
ANGELA
I's thinkin' about singing in the
choir.
LAZARUS
At church?
ANGELA
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good
voice or not but... practice is only
on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
LAZARUS
(grinning)
You gonna sing me somethin'?
ANGELA
When? Now? Oh. No.
LAZARUS
Come on, just a little somethin'.
Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Angela blushes. She looks around and then leans in close to
Laz. She sings softly, sweetly, with all her soul.
ANGELA
(singing)
There is a balm in Gilead to make
the wounded whole.
Laz is falling in love. She is so beautiful to him, he doesn't
see the people running to the front of the grocery store.
ANGELA
(singing)
There is a balm in Gilead to save my
sick, sick soul.
(opens her eyes, speaks)
So. You think I should be in the
choir?
Laz is grinning from ear to ear. He is about to speak but
the commotion outside the grocery catches his attention. His
smile fades.
ANGELA
What? What is it?
Laz bolts toward the grocery as fast as he can.
Ronnie has parked Gill's truck on the square. He starts
walking up to the grocery store.
He sees Laz carrying Rae in his arms. She is sobbing into
his chest, blind to all around her. Ronnie freezes in shock
as Laz approaches.
LAZARUS
Move, son.
(Ronnie is unable to
move)
Goddammit, kid, get outta my way!
Laz pushes Ronnie causing him to fall backwards on to the
pavement.
Ronnie watches Laz put Rae in his truck and drive away. A
wave of nausea hits. He turns over and heaves.
CUT TO:
The wooden chimes are deathly still above the porch. The
evening cicadas have begun their chorus.
Rae is wrapped in the quilt, laying on the couch. She is
awake and motionless, helpless to her depression.
Laz's truck groans as it bounces into the crowded parking
lot of Bojo's.
Rae steps out, looking beautiful in her sun dress. Laz slams
the door to his truck, guitar case in hand.
They begin walking inside. Rae's watch goes off. She quickly
turns it off. But a faint echo of the alarm can be heard
behind her. She stops and turns toward the truck. The sound
is gone.
LAZARUS
What is it?
RAE
Nothin'.
They go inside.
Ronnie's hand appears from under the blue tarp in the back
of Laz's truck. He pulls himself out and looks around.
Both Laz and Rae are drinking water from the sink in tall
glasses like they've been stranded in a desert.
RAE
Are you drunk?
(Laz shrugs)
Keep drinkin' water and you won't
get a headache in the mornin'.
LAZARUS
Yeah, gal I been here before.
RAE
(smiling)
I guess you have.
Ronnie lifts his head from sleep - his memory of Rae has
vanished.
He is leaning against the corner of the barn, his .45 in his
grip. His gaze slowly turns toward Laz's darkened house.
His hand begins to shake.
FADE TO BLACK.
A crow squawks in the rows of corn. A bright morning is
coming.
The door opens. Angela looks surprised to see Laz. She is
dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, wearing rubber gloves from
cleaning.
ANGELA
Hey.
LAZARUS
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that
nosey gal up at the counter give me
your home address. Hope you don't
mind me comin' over.
ANGELA
What do you need?
LAZARUS
I need ya help again.
Angela notices Rae and Ronnie seated in Laz's truck.
ANGELA
More cough syrup?
LAZARUS
Can I come in?
Angela takes a breath and opens the door wider.
Tehronne leads Laz down the back steps.
They both round the corner, revealing an old Chevy Caprice.
It is light brown except for one door that is gray, however
the chrome rims on the car are impressive -- worth more that
the entire car by a long shot.
TEHRONNE
It got some miles on it, but my boys
say she run good. Got fresh 22's on
her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how
it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody
gonna come lookin' for it. I got the
pinks... got no problem.
(hands Laz the keys)
Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no
bus.
LAZARUS
(moved, impressed)
Don't see generosity much these days.
Everything always got a catch. Guess
I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
TEHRONNE
Nobody ever asks me to do shit like
this for people. And you know what?
I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
Tehronne walks back into the pool hall, leaving Laz alone.
CUT TO:
Ronnie is wearing a brown corduroy jacket. He is attempting
to tie his neck tie in the side mirror of Laz's truck.
Lincoln, also wearing his Sunday best, steps up behind him.
LINCOLN
You Ronnie?
RONNIE
Yeah.
LINCOLN
I'm Lincoln. Guess I'm gonna be your
best man.
RONNIE
(ultimately accepting)
Okay.
LINCOLN
You havin' trouble with that tie?
Cuz I'm pretty good at it.
Ronnie nods. Lincoln steps behind him to tie the tie.
LINCOLN
Gotta do it like this or I get all
turned around.
Ronnie turns toward the trailer. He is in his suit, standing
in his front yard -- Lincoln at his side. R.L. stands to the
side with a Bible in his hands.
R.L. (V.O.)
When I became a man, I put childish
ways behind me.
Ronnie is amazed with what he sees. Laz leads beautiful Rae
down the steps as Angela tends to her side.
R.L. (V.O.)
Now we see but a poor reflection as
in the mirror; then we shall see
face to face. I know in part; then I
shall know fully, even as I am fully
known.
Rae holds firm to Laz's arm as they come together on the
green grass to witness and perform this union.
R.L. (V.O.)
And now these three remain: faith,
hope and love. But the greatest of
these is love.
(Looks to Laz)
Who gives this girl in marriage?
LAZARUS
I do.
Lazarus takes a few steps with Rae, offering her arm to
Ronnie. Ronnie and Laz stay locked in each other's gaze.
LAZARUS
You got her now?
Laz stands next to Angela as Ronnie and Rae face R.L.
together.
R.L.
Ronnie. Rae. I want you to look at
each other and listen to me carefully.
Do you understand?
RAE & RONNIE
Yes. Yes, sir.
They both obey -- each with a serious expression.
R.L.
I require and charge you both as you
stand in the presence of God to
remember that love and loyalty alone
will avail as a foundation of a happy
and enduring home.
(to Lincoln)
Go on, hand it to him.
Lincoln steps toward Ronnie and holds up the black velvet.
Ronnie takes the gold chain and carefully wraps it around
Rae's waist.
R.L.
No human ties are more tender. No
vows more sacred than those you now
assume.
Laz looks on -- a conflicted emotion of joy and loss.
R.L.
If these solemn vows be kept
inviolate, the home which you are
establishing will abide in peace and
your life will be filled with joy.
Angela reaches over and takes Laz's hand in hers.
CUT TO:
Ronnie is at the wheel of the Chevy Caprice. Rae sits silently
next to him.
Rae looks out the window as a huge 18 wheeler rolls up on
her side. She tries to ignore it and the tension it brings.
She turns to see that Ronnie is sweating. Another truck is
on his side sandwiching them in. An attack is coming over
Ronnie.
His breath is short. His chest tightens. Rae reaches over
and gently strokes the back of his neck.
RONNIE
I gotta pull over.
He breaks. The two trucks zoom ahead as Ronnie breaks to the
side. Dust flies as the Chevy skids to a stop on the side of
the road.
Trucks zip by shaking the car, as Ronnie tries to get control
of his breathing.
Rae tries to stay calm, stroking the back of his neck as he
struggles for breath. He puts his forehead against the wheel
to stave off the building nausea.
RONNIE
(through clenched
teeth)
FUCK!
Fear comes to Rae's face as she notices her middle finger
scratching at the back of Ronnie's neck. She pulls it away
and shoves her hand between her thighs.
Her eyes close as the burning builds. She grips the gold
chain around her waist.
FLASH TO
QUICK CUTS
The chain, tight around Rae as she struggles. Rae panting
and sweating on Laz's floor. She reaches out. Her hand lands
on the strings of his guitar. A single string is plucked.
FLASH BACK TO:
Rae opens her eyes -- the low note still sounding in her
head. She places her hand back on his neck. And then, soft
as a prayer:
RAE
(singing)
You are my sunshine. My only sunshine.
You make me happy, when times are
gray.
Ronnie slowly turns and looks at Rae, his head still resting
on the steering wheel. The panting has slowed. Color starts
returning to his cheeks.
RAE
(singing)
You'll never know dear, how much I
love you.
Please don't take, my sunshine away.
The anxiety is gone. Ronnie takes a breath and looks at Rae,
humbled and thankful of her power to soothe him.
RAE
See. We're okay.
Rae is smiling.
