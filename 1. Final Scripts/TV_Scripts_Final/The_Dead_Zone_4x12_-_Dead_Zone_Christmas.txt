                        It's too big.

                        Ya think?


  11INT. SMITH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny and Bruce struggle with a giant Christmas tree.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we can chop a few feet off
                        the bottom.

                                        BRUCE
                        Or cut a hole in the roof.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You stick to Christmas dinner and
                        let me handle the ambiance.

                                        BRUCE
                        I need some egg nog.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds good.

          They drop the tree and head for the kitchen.


  22INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Bruce heads straight for the fridge and throws it open. 
            Something stops him in his tracks...

                                        BRUCE
                        What in the hell is that?

          Johnny reaches in and lifts out a giant poultry thing
          sitting in a large roasting pan.

                        This, my friend, is a Turducken.

                                        BRUCE
                        Turducken?  You mean one of those
                          chicken-inside a duck-inside a
                        turkey things?

                        That's the one.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's kinda creepy lookin'.  Like
                          Frankenstein meets Colonel Sanders.

          Bruce taps it with a handy spoon.  Tink-Tink. 

                                        BRUCE
                        And it's frozen solid.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So?

                                        BRUCE
                        So it's nearly noon.  This thing
                        is gonna take until New Year's to
                        thaw.

                        Worst case scenario, I break out
                        the blow torch and we blast the
                        sucker from the inside out.

                                        BRUCE
                        That sounds appetizing.

          Johnny heads for the door.

          Johnny has to shove the Christmas Tree aside to get to
          the front door.  He opens it, REVEALING...

                                (suddenly concerned)
                        Is everything alright?

                                (slightly ominous)
                        I had a vision.

                        I was sitting at home and suddenly
                        I saw it.  Clear as day.  It was
                        me and I was spending another
                          Christmas by myself.  Then I
                        thought to myself, who else do
                        you know that's probably on his
                        own this time of year?

                        And you thought of me.

                                        ALEX
                        Who else might want to hide away,
                        watch bad Kung Fu movies and drink
                        this outrageously expensive bottle
                        of French wine?

          She holds out the bottle in one hand and the chop-socky
          DVDs in the other.  Johnny musters a weak, supportive
          smile.  Alex instantly realizes her mistake.

                                        ALEX
                        Oh God.  You have plans, don't
                        you?  This is so embarrassing.

          She starts away, as Johnny hurries in front of her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait.  It's nothing, really.

            Suddenly, Bruce comes through the doorway.

  3A3AVISION - MATCH MOVE MORPH

          The camera ramps around the Johnny and Alex, ending tight-
          tight-tight on the frozen kiss.

                                        A VOICE (O.S.)
                        Step away from the girl.

          Johnny cautiously opens one eye to look at the source of
          the voice.  What he sees makes him break the kiss.


          THEIR POV

          Standing in Johnny's entryway is a surly young SANTA CLAUS
          and three mean ass looking dark green elves.  (This is
          not the Santa we meet later, but an archetypal Santa.)

          Santa raises a gun and points it at Johnny.

          tree.

                                        ALEX
                        It's not so much Christmas that
                        bothers me, but what it represents. 
                        The stress and turmoil.  The
                          anxiety-induced shopping frenzy. 
                        God forbid we shoot for a little
                        peace on Earth, Goodwill towards
                        Men.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's right.  We'd all be a lot
                        better off if we just forgot all
                        the commercialism and looked for
                          a little more inner peace. 
                                (checks his watch)
                        Oh man, I gotta go!

                        What happen to forgetting
                          commercialism and the search for
                        inner peace?

                        there's no such thing as Santa
                        Claus.

          Bruce is putting his fingers in his ears...

                                        BRUCE
                        I can't hear this.

          He heads into the kitchen.

                                        ALEX
                        I don't mean to sound cynical. 
                        It's just that I experience my
                        visions through peoples' emotions,
                        and let's face it, around
                        Christmas, a lot of us are feeling
                        pretty lousy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        On that happy note.

                                        ALEX
                        Are you sure it's a good idea to
                        go out there considering what we
                        saw?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You said it yourself, your visions
                        are metaphorical.  I've been a
                        little naughty, but not nearly
                        bad enough for Santa to put a
                        bullet in my chest.  Besides, I
                          promised J.J. that game.

                                        ALEX
                        Okay, but I'm coming with you.

          She grabs her jacket and they leave...


  55EXT. SIDEWALK - MOVING - DAY

          Johnny and Alex walk and talk.

                                        ALEX
                        Why do you think Santa would be*
                          carrying a .38 revolver?*

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know, maybe he lives in a*
                        bad part of the North Pole.

          He can see that she's genuinely bothered.*

                        won't be that bad.*

                        Because you're here.  And that
                        has to be a good thing.
                                (then noticing)
                        There it is.


  66JOHNNY'S POV - THE CLEAVES MILLS TOY BOX TOY STORE - DAY

            A generic toy store, located on a corner.  A large sign*
          in the window says: "RATCHET DEADLOCKED HEADQUARTERS".


  77EXT. CLEAVES MILLS TOY BOX - DAY

          Johnny and Alex hustle across the street toward the side
          of the toy store to see:

          A LINE OF PEOPLE

          Stretching down the sidewalk, grim-looking shoppers.*

                                        ALEX
                        Looks like you aren't the only
                          last-minute shopper.

          Johnny decides to ask a surly looking DAD.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me?  Is this the line to
                        buy the Ratchet Deadlocked game?*

                                        SURLY DAD
                                (deadpan)
                        No, this is the line to see who
                        gets to spend the night with
                          Angelina Jolie.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I see.  Well, good luck with that.*
                                (to Alex)*
                        I guess we're waiting.*

          AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE

          A nervous, teenage employee makes an announcement through
          a large, battery powered bullhorn.

                                        EMPLOYEE

                        that we are completely out of the
                        Ratchet Deadlocked video game. *

            A collective GROAN goes up from the people in line.

                                        EMPLOYEE
                                (without irony)
                        Thank you and have a very Merry
                        Christmas.

            A disgruntled shopper turns and BUMPS into Alex, as...


    7A7ASUDDENLY, WITHOUT WARNING - SFX

          The crowd TRANSFORMS into ugly MOB, descending on the
          hapless employee, crushing him in a rugby scrum.  The
          bent bullhorn and bits of his uniform fly above the angry
          mob.


  7B7BRESUME - ALEX

          Watches, reacting to her vision, stunned.


          WIDER VIEW TO INCLUDE JOHNNY

          Reveals Alex's POV to be a vision; the disappointed crowd*
          leaving quietly.*

          Directly ahead of then, TWO SOCCER MOMS.*

                        better hurry.

          The Two Moms hurry off as Alex grabs Johnny by the arm.*

                        Follow me.

          Alex leads him through the dispersing crowd in the parking
          lot.  She catches up with the Soccer Moms we saw a moment
          ago.

                                        ALEX

                        I'm sorry, but I think you dropped*
                        this on the sidewalk.

          She offer up the dollar bill.

                                        MOM TWO

          When the Mom touches the dollar bill, we HEAR A DZ WHOOSH -*
          The view RAMPS INTO THE DOLLAR, then tracks from Mom Two's
          hand, through the dollar, to Alex's hand, through Alex,
          finally to Johnny, triggering:

          Johnny and Alex are transported to another toy store where

          store, "BIG PETE'S GAME WORLD" -- as the vision ends.

  1111IN FRONT OF THE STORE

          Johnny and Alex encounter a STRANGE OLD MAN, a lost-looking
          SANTA wearing a maroon track suit, tennis shoes, a sad-*
          looking red santa hat and holding a pillowcase full of*
          something.  He seems like a street person, talking to*
          anyone who will listen.

                                        "SANTA"

          Johnny heads past him into the store, followed by Alex*
          who lingers in the doorway long enough to make eye contact
          with "Santa".*

          She holds his gaze a beat, as if she is trying to get*

                        I just wear the suit when I'm

                        ask me a question.

          J.J. looks over at Sarah, who nods okay.

                        After they stole his bag, I chased
                        them into a store but they got
                        away out the back door.  He can't
                          remember anything before that.

                        That would qualify.  I'll get his
                        prints off a glass.  If he's got
                          a record we'll know who he is in

                        That's right.  Listen, I was
                        wondering, have you ever see them

          A blind man with dark glasses and a tin cup waits near a
          building entrance, the occasional PEDESTRIAN dropping in
          a coin.  A particularly fetching WOMAN walks past, and
          the blind man sneaks a peek over the top of his glasses,
            revealing himself to be our "SANTA".  Just as he resumes
          character, an ARMORED CAR pulls up and parks right in
          front of him.

          Johnny and Alex watch as the ARMED GUARD jumps out of the
          armored car and runs into the building.  A short beat
          later he returns with the money bag, knocking on the back
          door for the driver to let him into the truck.  As soon
          as the back door is open, "Santa" makes his move, pulling
          a gun from his coat as he knocks out the guard and forces
          his way into the armored car.  We hear a SCUFFLE inside,
          then Santa appears with the money bag and runs off down
          the sidewalk with the Guards FIRING at him as he runs.

                        When I was a kid, my Mom always
                        did Christmas.  She'd start
                          planning the day after
                          Thanksgiving.  By Christmas Eve,
                        she was a puddle of tears.  I
                        guess the expectations always
                          exceeded the reality.  But it was
                        always okay because we were all

          The house is dark as Matthew slips in.  He rummages around,

                          I figured you'd come back.

          Matthew, exhausted, sits down on the broken couch.  He
          suddenly seems like a boy, instead of a tough street kid.

                        Mom and dad were gonna get
                          divorced.  One night, she woke us
                        up and told us to stuff all our
                        clothes into some garbage bags. 
                        She said we were leaving, that my
                        dad didn't want us anymore.  We
                        didn't even get to say good-bye.

                        After she died, they were going
                        to split us up.  So we took off. 
                        All we had was this picture.

          Matthew pulls the worn snapshot of a dad and three small
          boys out of his back pocket.  The picture was obviously
          taken when the boys were very young.

          When Johnny touches the picture, we hear a DZ WHOOSH, but
          don't see the vision.

                        How about we give Santa back his
                        bag and go have some dinner?  You
                        ever had Turducken?

          Alex is asleep in the chair, bathed in the blue light
          from the TV in the otherwise dark room.  As we watch her,
          the sounds of voices become audible.

          A change in the pitch of the male voice wakes Alex and
          she sits up, looking at the television.

          ALEX

          Suddenly figures out what's different about the voice. 
          Now there's two male voices, speaking in unison.

          She turns to look at "Santa" who is still sitting next to
          her, no longer channel surfing, but watching this movie,
            repeating the man's dialog word for word.

                                        "SANTA" AND MALE VOICE
                        It's going to be different this
                        time.  Don't you see that?  I
                        love you.  I love you more than
                        I've ever loved anyone. 

          Alex looks from "Santa" to the television, where she sees
          a close-up of the Woman, listening to the Man's words.

                                        FEMALE VOICE
                        We can't go on pretending none of
                        this has happened.

          Just as it would be natural to cut to the Man's close-up,

          only younger.

                        It's him.

          Johnny flips on the lights, which seems to break "Santa"
          from his trance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why didn't you tell us you were
                        an actor?

                                        "SANTA"
                          I didn't remember until just now.

                        Hughes, star of stage and screen. 
                          I looked him up online.

                        That explains why we saw him doing
                        the things he was doing.  They
                        were movie parts.

                        And the stuff in his bag...

          Johnny dumps the contents onto the floor.  It's just junk,
          props from his old film career.

                                        "SANTA"
                        I remember now, I was at my
                        apartment.  I was going to play
                        Santa and pass out some of my
                          memorabilia at a retirement home
                        around the corner.  I felt a little
                        dizzy and then I... I must have
                        hit my head, because the next
                        thing I know I was fighting with
                        those kids on the sidewalk.

          Alex reaches down and picks up a hat, the same Sinatra-
          cool hat from the movie.  She hands it to Johnny,
          triggering:

                          Apparently, there was a house I

                        How?

                        Once we knew it was a custody
                        battle, it wasn't hard for Walt
                        to locate the dad.  Reverend Purdy
                        offered to let us use the Faith
                          Heritage helicopter to fly him
                        down.

                        Hungry, Gene?

                                        PURDY
                        Well, I wouldn't want to... 

          They all look at Bruce, then...

                                        BRUCE
                        Sit!  I'll set another place.

          He heads for the kitchen.

                                        ALEX
                                (to Johnny)
                        I take back every rotten thing I
                        ever said about Christmas.

          She touches Johnny's face and smiles...

                                        SARAH
                          Somebody should say something
                        before we eat.

                        It's Johnny's house, I think he
                        should be the one to say Grace.

          Johnny feels the pressure of everyone looking at him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, I'm not really very
                        religious, so I guess I'll just
                        say what's in my heart.

                        When I was a kid, it was always
                        just me, my mom and my dad.  Then,
                        after my father died, well, it
                        was just the two of us.  It was
                        okay, we had some good times. 
                        But I always wondered what it
                        would be like to have a big family,
                        people who cared about each other
                        and enjoyed being together.  You
                        people have made that come true
                        for me.
                                (to Bruce, Sarah and
                                Walt)
                        Old friends who are always there
                        through good times and bad.
                                (to J.J.)
                        A son who makes me prouder to be
                        his father with every day that
                        passes.
                                (to Alex)
                        Someone who shares a part of me
                        that no one else could ever
                          understand.
                                (to the others)
                        And new faces that bring home the
                        true meaning of friendship and
                        family.

          We HEAR the oven timer DING!

                                        BRUCE
                        My bird!  Excuse me.

          Bruce ducks away into the kitchen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This isn't exactly the way I had
                        things planned, but looking back
                        at it, I wouldn't have it any
                        other way.  In fact, I can't think
                        of one thing that would make this
                        moment any better.

          Just then, J.J. shouts from a nearby window.

                                        J.J.
                        Hey everybody, it's snowing!

                                        JOHNNY

          Everyone laughs as they all go to the windows and watch
          the flakes begin to fall...

                                        JOHNNY

          Johnny looks back through the window to SEE...

          POV - NIGEL

          He's out on the lawn looking up at the falling snow.

                                        JOHNNY

                        It looks like fun though.

                                        ALEX
                        I'm gonna join him.

                        Wait for me!

          As the last of them rushes out of the dining room, Bruce
          steps in, proudly carrying the roasted Turducken.

                                        BRUCE
                        Ladies and gentlemen, may I present
                        the Turducken!

          He looks up to find the entire room empty.

          SLOW MOTION.  As everyone plays in the snow, tossing
            snowballs at each other.  The SHOT FREEZES on a perfect
