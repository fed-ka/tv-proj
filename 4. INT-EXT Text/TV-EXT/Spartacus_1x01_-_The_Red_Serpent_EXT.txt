  Continue soaring across the plains, the harsh sun pounding 
  the parched earth. THUNDER BOOMS from a clear sky. No, not 
  thunder. The ROAR OF A CROWD. As the deafening sound splits 
  the air, we DIVE into a wooden ARENA on the edge of the 
  city.



  The CROWD howls as a MURMILLO GLADIATOR toys with DRENIS, a 
  bloodied Thracian prisoner. Drenis is a brute of a man, 
  early 30s, with an unruly black beard. He wields only a 
  sword against the shielded and armored Murmillo.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as we ROTATE AROUND the battle, Drenis and the Murmillo 
  trading deadly blows. Their swords crash against each other, 
  PROPELLING us


  INTO THE MURMILLO'S HELMET

  where we see the blazing fierceness of his eyes, sweat 
  coursing down his face from the exertion. The SOUNDS of the 
  CROWD FADE, replaced by the Murmillo's LABORED BREATHING. We 
  SNAP AROUND to






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

  THE MURMILLO'S POV

  from inside his helmet, looking through the grating of his 
  eye shields. Drenis lunges forward. As the Murmillo swings 
  his sword to meet him we

  PUSH OUT OF HIS HELMET

  and BACK INTO THE ARENA. The ROAR of the CROWD SURGES. The 
  Murmillo

  DEFLECTS DRENIS' BLOW

  and whirls around with his own sword. We DIVE IN close to 
  the blade as TIME SLOWS. Briefly reflected in the gleam of 
  the blood-splattered steel are the

  TWISTED FACES

  of the crowd, howling for blood.

  TIME RESUMES

  as the Gladiator's sword completes its arc, SLICING OPEN 
  DRENIS' ARM. The crowd CHEERS as

  BLOOD SPRAYS

  across the arena. We follow the blood, PUSHING THROUGH IT to 
  take us up to the bars of a PRISONER PEN. Reveal

  THE THRACIAN

  standing behind them. Mid 30s. Well muscled. Dirty and 
  battered. Long matted hair partially obscuring his searing 
  eyes. His grip tightens on

  THE SWORD

  in his hand. He stares out into the arena, waiting to be 
  called to his fate. We rotate around him, MORPHING US to --



  Lush and verdant. A stark contrast to the water-starved 
  lands of Capua. Snow-capped mountains sparkling on the 
  horizon. The Thracian's VILLAGE is nestled in a valley in 
  the distance. THRACIAN WARRIORS say goodbye to their wives 
  and children.

  THE THRACIAN WALKS PAST,

  joining Sura on a hilltop. He stands beside her looking out 
  across the mountains. A beat.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        I woke expecting my wife beside me.

                        She rose early to pray.

  She turns to him, her eyes betraying second thoughts.

                        That her husband would stay with 
                        her.

  He frowns at the suggestion.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        I thought we were in agreement.

  The Thracian tenses.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        What did they show you?

                                        SURA
                      My husband on his knees. Bowing 
                        before a great red serpent. The 
                        life flowing from his veins.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        And the meaning you take from it?

                                        SURA
                        A warning. That you are destined 
                        for great and unfortunate things, 
                      if you go to war.

  The Thracian absorbs that, gently dismisses it.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        The Getae worship the mountain 
                        wolf. They place no faith in 
                        snakes. It was only a dream.

                                        SURA
                        And if it is not?

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        I gave my word, Sura. Blood and 
                        honor. It speaks to the man.

  She nods, understanding despite her heart cleaving in two.

                                        THE THRACIAN(cont'd)
                        Nothing will keep me from returning 
                      to your arms. Not the Getae. Not 
                        the Romans. Not the gods 
                        themselves.

  He takes her in his arms. She bites back the tears as she 
  hugs him close.

                                        SURA
                        The nights grow cold. What am I to

  She complies, lifting her dress to reveal the turn of a 
  perfect thigh. He removes the ornate PURPLE BINDING from his 
  sheath. He kneels, tying it around her thigh.

                        Keep me close to your thighs. The

  He rises, a warm smile bending his lips. He kisses her, soft 
  and loving.

                        For you.

  One final kiss, then he turns to join the march from the 
  village. She watches him go, her eyes filled with 
    sadness...and pride.

  ON THE THRACIAN

  as he slips his helmet on. He picks up the pace and draws 
  his sword as the background BLURS behind him, transforming 
  into --



  A frozen wasteland dotted with half burned trees. The 
  BARBARIANS howl as they crash through the snow, with swords, 
  axes, and spears. The Barbarians wear no helmets, their 
  faces PAINTED in thick streaks, highlighting multiple

  FACIAL PIERCINGS AND SCARIFICATIONS.

  An army from the depths of the underworld. SNAP AROUND THEM 
  as they streak past, REVEALING

  THE THRACIAN AND THE AUXILIARY

  rushing to meet them. The Auxiliary is composed entirely of 
  THRACIAN WARRIORS, wearing the armor of their various 
  tribes. They are distinctly non-Roman in appearance -- and 
  ferocity.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as The Thracian slams into the hordes, his sword trailing

  SLOW MOTION RIBBONS OF BLOOD

  as he viciously hacks his way through arms, legs, and guts.  
  The BLOOD RIBBONS hang in the air as the Thracians following 
  PUSH THROUGH THEM, streaking their armor and faces.

                        Hold the line!

  DRENIS,

  the prisoner in the arena from the opening, hacks his way 
  through the hordes, bellowing merrily as he adds to the 
  carnage.

                                        DRENIS
                        I will fuck your women! I WILL FUCK 
                        THEM!

  BYZO,

  aka "the Goat" because of his looks and rather strong odor, 
  runs a Barbarian through with his spear. BLOOD spatters his 
  terrified face as he eyes the overwhelming odds.

                                        BYZO
                        Where the fuck are the Romans?

  THE THRACIAN DECAPITATES A BARBARIAN,

  the severed head grimacing in agony as it FLIES PAST THE 
  CAMERA. He spots a BARBARIAN ARCHER about to loose an arrow 
  at him.

  THE THRACIAN HURLS HIS SWORD

  at the archer. TIME SLOWS as it ROTATES through the battle, 
  narrowly missing Barbarians and Thracians alike. TIME 
  RESUMES as the sword

  SLAMS INTO THE ARCHER'S SKULL,

  lifting him off his feet. The arrow goes wild, missing The 
  Thracian but still coming close enough to THROW SPARKS as it 
  creases his helmet in SLOW MOTION.

  A BARBARIAN BLASTS HIS HORN,

  sounding the retreat. The hordes scramble back into the 
  woods as

  CLAUDIUS GLABER

  thunders up on his horse. Glaber, 40, handsome, with the 
  keen eyes of an ambitious man, is the LEGATUS (regional 
  commander) of the Roman campaign. His armor is pristine and 
    unblemished.

  He thunders after the enemy, followed by ROMAN SOLDIERS and 
  CAVALRY.

                        They'd just get in the way.

  He yanks his sword from the fallen Archer's head. BLOOD arcs 
  from the blade. TIME SLOWS as we follow

  THE BLOOD SPRAY

  up into the sky. It freezes in a familiar pattern, becoming 
  the CRATERS ON THE FULL MOON as we MORPH TO --

  A FULL MOON

    illuminating a crisp night sky. ADJUST DOWN from the FULL 
  MOON to find we are now --



  Snow glitters across the muddy terrain. The Thracian, worse 
  for wear after months of war, stands on a hill overlooking

  THE ROMAN ENCAMPMENT.

  Thousands of torches reveal the perfect grids of the 
  encampment, with the main command tent in the central 
  square. The Thracian turns away, heading back into the shit 
  and blood stained snow of

  THE THRACIAN AUXILIARY ENCAMPMENT.

  The Thracians are exhausted, battered, and malnourished. No 
  well organized tents protecting them from the elements. 
  Instead they huddle around


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

  MAKESHIFT CAMPFIRES,

  animal skins pulled around them for warmth. Drenis, Byzo, 
  and a knot of hard looking THRACIANS choke down bowls of 
  oily soup. Drenis discards his in disgust, the bowl landing 
  at The Thracian's feet.

                                        DRENIS

                        Guts and bones! While Glaber and 
                        his Romans feast on meat.

  The Thracian picks up Drenis' bowl and scoops himself the 
  dregs of the soup from a large kettle over the fire.

                        nourishment than men.

  The men chuckle. Drenis doesn't share their mirth.

                        This is a laugh? How is this a

  WHAM! The Thracian kicks the much bigger Drenis in the gut. 
  Drenis flies back, rolling across the fire as he smashes 
  back to the snow-crusted earth.

  Violence and mirth. Part and parcel of this ancient land.

  Just as he cocks his fist to smash in Drenis' face,

  THE SNORT OF A HORSE

  LEGATUS GLABER

  The Thracians go quiet. Glaber eyes them with contempt, 
  waves towards his Tribune to address them.

                                          TRIBUNE
                        The Legatus needs volunteers to 
                        scout beyond the forward line.

  His eyes fall on The Thracian and Drenis, still entangled.

                                          TRIBUNE(cont'd)
                        You. Tactical report by sunrise.

                      Or go without rations.

  Glaber spurs his horse, thundering off with his men. Drenis 
  glares.

                                        DRENIS
                        "Please" would have done.

  The Thracian stands, offers his hand to help Drenis up.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        We'll finish our discussion after.

  Drenis accepts his hand with a frown.

                                        DRENIS
                        And if we're dead?

                                        THE THRACIAN
                      My boot will find your ass in the 
                        afterlife.

  The Thracian grins as he yanks his sword from its sheath, 
  the GLEAMING BLADE WIPING US TO --

  We PLUMMET from the aerial shot to find The Thracian and 
  Drenis stealthily advancing through the arctic mountainside. 
  The Thracian pauses, signaling Drenis to hold. Nerves 
  strain.

  THE SOUND OF DRUMS,

  distant and menacing, are carried on the frigid winds. The 
  Thracian signals Drenis to swing wide up onto

  A HILL

  thick with snow. They crest it on their bellies, peering 
  down into

  A FROZEN VALLEY

  some distance away. TORCHES dot the icy landscape as the 
  Barbarian hordes strike their tents and load their horses. 
  Drenis grins, his teeth gleaming in the moonlight.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        They're breaking camp.

                        Frightened little gashes, running 
                        with their cocks between their 
                        cheeks.

  The Thracian's eyes narrow at the line of torches heading 
  off into the night.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Retreat would take them beyond the 
                        mountains to the north. Their 
                        torches bear west.

                                        DRENIS
                        West?

                        They're swinging around to attack 
                        the villages below the pass. Our 
                        villages.

                                        DRENIS
                        Slippery fucking cunts.

  The Thracian's eyes burn at the thought. WE ARM UP AND OVER 
  the scene, the terrain once again MORPHING into

  THE TWO DIMENSIONAL MAP

  on Glaber's war table. Pull back to reveal we are in --



  The Thracian thunders down a dirt road lined with well 
  ordered Roman tents. Drenis follows, more subdued in his 
  reaction.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Pompous, arrogant, Roman boy-lover! 
                        All but called us liars.

                                        DRENIS
                        How are you certain?

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        You heard what he said. "Turned in 
                        the mountains at night!" Like he's 
                        speaking to children!

                                        DRENIS
                        No, about the boys. How do you know 
                      he favors them?

  The Thracian glares.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Now who's having a laugh?

                                        DRENIS
                        There is a tickle at the back of my 
                        throat.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        That would be the cock Glaber just 
                        forced down it.

                      If he wants to send his own men, 
                        let him. Won't change the direction 
                        the Getae move.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Glaber's the most dangerous kind of 
                        fool. One with a title.

                                        DRENIS
                        Truth. But perhaps he has better 
                        sense when it comes to wine...

  He opens his cloak to reveal the ornate JUG OF WINE Glaber's 
  wife Ilithyia brought him. Drenis just lifted it from the 
  command tent. The Thracian stares in disbelief.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                                  hushed)(
                        You stole his wine?!

                                        DRENIS
                        Only borrowed it. Plan to piss it 
                        back shortly.

  Drenis quickly conceals the jug with his cloak as they pass 
  a knot of ROMAN SOLDIERS, WIPING US TO --



  Close on the dying embers of a fire. PULL BACK to reveal The 
  Thracian sitting beside it, watching the sunrise as he 
  sharpens his sword with a stone. His weary, concerned eyes 
  tell of no sleep. And worry for his wife's safety.

  DRENIS

  snores nearby, passed out beside his jug of pilfered wine. 
  Drool entangles Drenis' beard, intent on forming a frozen 
  crust.

  A PIERCING HORN

  splits the air. The Thracian tenses. Finally, the call to 
  arms. SHOUTS ERUPT, followed by Byzo and the other men 
  hustling to gather their gear. Spartacus nudges Drenis.

                                        THE THRACIAN

                        The Romans sound the call.

                        Fuck the Romans. And their fucking 
                        horns.

  The Thracian kicks Drenis.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Up, you drunken goat. The Legatus 
                        has gained his senses.

  Drenis groans, his eyes struggling to adjust to the harsh 
  aftermath of day. The Thracian tends to his gear.

                                        DRENIS
                        Any wine left?

                        Your belly holds the sum.

                      It may return the balance 
                        presently.

  He rises with a groan, wipes at his beard.

                        How far to the mouth of the pass?

                        A drink would spur my intent.

  The Thracian laughs.

  Byzo pauses in packing his meager gear.

  The Thracian shares a look with Drenis.

                        Byzo. Did the Legatus send his own 
                        men to scout the front?

                        Yes, he told me all about it over a 
                        delicious morning meal. How the 
                        fuck should I know? They blow their 
                        fucking horns, a Roman dog barks 
                        and the gods shit on me. Welcome to

                        The Getae head west.

  The men within earshot react.

                        reason. If we don't move to follow, 
                        every village west of here will 
                        fall.

  The men grumble, a crowd beginning to form. Byzo snorts in 
  contempt.

  The Thracian spots Legatus Glaber riding up in full polished 
  adornment, flanked by his Tribune and TWO ROMAN SOLDIERS.

  The air electrifies. A ripple of uncertainty passes through 
  the Thracian Soldiers. Glaber glares down at The Thracian.

  Glaber suddenly draws his sword to strike The Thracian. The 
  Thracian reacts, grabbing the bridle of Glaber's horse and 
  yanking hard. The horse rears back.

  TIME SLOWS

  as Glaber is thrown, his body drifting lazily to the ground.

  THE TRIBUNE AND HIS SOLDIERS

  HELL IS UNLEASHED

  as Drenis and the Thracians rush to meet the Roman threat in

  ROMAN SOLDIER #1

  is pulled off his horse by Drenis. The Tribune kicks him 
  away and makes a break for the Roman encampment. The 
  Thracian grabs up the Spearman's weapon and draws back. He 
  hesitates, knowing the measure it will cost him to unleash 
  it.

                                        DRENIS
                        Throw! Throw, damn you, before he 
                      --

  The Thracian hurls the spear. It WHISTLES through the air. 
  BLOOD ERUPTS as it slices the Tribune's neck open. He 
  clutches at the wound, tumbles to the ground, dead. The 
  Thracian stares, eyes filled with the weight of the deed.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.

                        lives are there. If not, I could 
                        give a fuck.

  The men scatter, grabbing their gear. Drenis moves to The 
  Thracian, who stares at the carnage, his fate altered beyond 
  repair.

                                          DRENIS(cont'd)
                        What of the Legatus?

  The Thracian casts his eyes to Glaber, laying unconscious in 
  the muddy snow. His face hardens.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Leave him in the mud.

  The Thracian turns to go, his CLOAK WIPING US TO --



  The golden sun warms the skin of Sura, The Thracian's wife. 
  She hums absently, gathering PERSIMMONS from the great 
  gnarled tree..

  SURA PAUSES,

  sensing something. Her eyes scan the tree line. Nothing. She 
  laughs at herself, turns to go -- and freezes.

  A BARBARIAN

  is now standing in the clearing, watching her. A frozen 
  beat. The Barbarian doesn't move. Sura's eyes flick to the 
  tree line as

  MORE BARBARIANS

  appear from the woods. FIVE in all. Standing. Watching. A 
  bird CAWS. Sura explodes into purpose, making a break for 
  it. The Barbarians descend.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.
  CONTINUED:

  BARBARIAN #1 GRABS HER,

  laughing at her struggles. WHAM! His mirth is cut short as 
  she slams her head into his nose, breaking it in a

  SPURT OF BLOOD.

  He howls, releasing her. She whirls and plants her foot in 
  his crotch. Barbarian #1 sucks air in agony.

  SURA GRABS HIS SWORD,

  yanking it from his sheath as he crumples to the ground. The 
  remaining four Barbarians chuckle as they encircle her, 
  drawing their own weapons. She holds her sword out, trying 
  to keep them at bay, which makes them laugh even harder.

  A BARBARIAN WITH ROTTED TEETH (#2)

  grins as he steps forward with his axe -- then freezes in 
  confusion as he spots something behind Sura high in the sky. 
  Sura glances behind her and sees

  SOMETHING GLINTING THROUGH THE AIR

  like a diamond in the sky. At the last second Sura realizes 
  what it is. TIME SLOWS as Sura ducks, narrowly avoiding

  THE THRACIAN'S SWORD

  as it whizzes past her head. TIME RESUMES as the sword slams 
  into ROTTEN TEETH'S mouth, knocking him off his feet in an 
  explosion of blood and teeth. Dead before he hits the 
  ground.

  THE THRACIAN APPEARS

  from the treeline, sprinting full tilt at the Barbarians. 
  He's now armed with nothing but a shield. Sura's heart leaps 
  into her chest.

  SHE SWINGS HER SWORD,

  slicing open Barbarian #1 as he struggles back to his feet.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as The Thracian launches himself at the remaining three 
  Barbarians. He slams his shield into Barbarian #3, crushing 
  his face in a spray of sweat and blood. Barbarian #4 and #5 
  attack,



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.
  CONTINUED:

  HAMMERING THE THRACIAN

  with sword and axe. Sura tries to intervene, but Barbarian 
  #4 backhands her in the face. She reels back, blood flowing 
  from a busted lip.

  THE THRACIAN ERUPTS,

  his shield flashing in the sun as it finds Barbarian #4's 
  throat, crushing it in an explosion of gore. A beat as The 
  Thracian and Barbarian #5 eye each other, bloodied and 
  winded.

  BARBARIAN #5 HOWLS,

  rushing The Thracian. They trade blows, each getting in 
  their crimson strikes. The Thracian slams the edge of his 
  shield into Barbarian #5's axe arm,

  SNAPPING THE BONE

  and sending his axe tumbling. Barbarian #5 screams, dropping 
  to his knees to clutch at the BONES protruding from his 
  flesh. The Thracian grabs the fallen axe and

  DECAPITATES BARBARIAN #5

  in a geyser of blood and gore. The headless body crumples.  
  Twitches. Is finally still.

  SURA AND THE THRACIAN

  rush to each other. He grabs her into a passionate kiss.  
  She touches his battered face, a thousand questions searing 
  her tongue.

  A BARBARIAN HORN

  splits the air, interrupting the answers.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        The village...

  They rush to

  A HILL

  Overlooking their village. THICK SMOKE rises from the 
  destruction of the barbarian assault. Sura starts forward, 
  but The Thracian catches her arm. He shakes his head, his 
  face etched with regret.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

                      We have to go. Now.

  He turns away, his body WIPING US TO --



  A CAMPFIRE burns. PULL BACK to REVEAL Sura sitting alone 
  beside it. Stained by dirt and blood, face etched by fear 
  and regret. Something moves behind her. She whirls to find

  THE THRACIAN

  appearing from the darkness. Bruised and battered from his 
  adventures, sword in hand.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        They haven't followed.

                                        SURA
                        Why would they. When they have an 
                        entire village to...

  She can't finish the thought. The Thracian's face slides 
  into regret.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        You were right. I never should have 
                        left.

                                        SURA
                        You had given your word. The fault 
                        lies with the Romans in breaking 
                        theirs.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        I'll point to their shortcomings, 
                      if I ever find myself in Rome.

  He sits with a grimace, favoring his side. Sura tenses.

                                        SURA
                        You're hurt.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        It's nothing.

                                        SURA

                        You should be used to it by now.

  He frowns, gingerly moves his cloak aside. His well muscled 
  body is revealed. Sura reacts to the bruises, scrapes, and 
  gashes. A tapestry of pain.

                                        THE THRACIAN

  She forces a smile.

                      Of course you are. Hold still...

  She takes piece of wrap from her dress. He winces as she 
  tends to his wounds. A long beat. The fire crackles, 
  throwing flickering shadows across their faces.

                        that far. Not to the risk of

                        South it is.

  The Thracian watches her face as the campfire caresses it. 
  Even dirty and disheveled, she's radiantly beautiful. The 
  Thracian drifts from love to sadness.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                        You did what you could. You came

                        your life.

  He puts a hand to her cheek.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        There is no life without you.

  He kisses her. Longing and desire flare. They hungrily 
  devour each other, silhouetted by the campfire.

  MOVE INTO THE FIRE

  as the FLAMES consume the screen. SHADOWS of SURA and THE 
  THRACIAN'S NAKED BODIES writhe within them. The flames 
  ABATE, dissolving to

  THE SMOULDERING REMAINS

  of the campfire, warmed by a golden sun. PULL BACK to reveal 
  we've TRANSITIONED TO --



  The Thracian lies naked under his cloak, Sura nestled 
  against him. He stirs, his eyes finding her. Even more 
  radiant in slumber. His gaze moves down her body to

  HER BARE LEG

  half exposed. A bit of FABRIC flutters. He eases the blanket 
  back, revealing the PURPLE BINDING tied once again to her 
  thigh. His fingers caress it. Sura stirs. She smiles 
  sleepily, eyes sparkling with love -- until a SHADOW 
  eclipses them, the source filling her with terror. The 
  Thracian whips around to find

  ROMAN SOLDIERS

  now looming over them. He grabs for his sword but a 
  SOLDIER'S BOOT slams down on his arm. The Thracian grunts in 
  pain.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

  SURA SCREAMS

  as calloused hands rip her from the crude bed, hoisting her 
  naked into the morning air.

                        Sura!

  Boots slam into The Thracian as the Soldiers kick him into 
  submission.

                        No!

  Sura is dragged away. The Thracian desperately struggles to 
  follow.

                        Sura --

  WHAM! A boot catches him in the face. TIME SLOWS as BLOOD 
  arcs from his mouth, the crimson wave hanging in the air for 
  a moment before TIME RESUMES. The Thracian's head swims, his 
  eyes forced back into focus by the appearance of

  GLABER ASTRIDE HIS HORSE,

  riding up with more SOLDIERS. A GASH creases Glaber's brow 
  from his fall from his horse in the Auxiliary encampment. 
  The Thracian is yanked to his feet.

                                        GLABER
                        Did you truly believe? That 
                        insurrection could be cast without 
                        consequence?

  Glaber dismounts, confronting The Thracian.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                      My Tribune dead. Half the auxiliary 
                        deserted.

  He reaches into his cloak and pulls out an official looking 
  scroll wrapped around a heavy, ornate rod.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        Now orders recalling me to Rome. 
                        All from your hand.

  The Thracian spits blood, glares.

                        courtesy of her husband.

  The Thracian lunges, but the soldiers hold him.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        The shadow of Rome is vast. And 
                        you, Thracian, will die under it.

  Glaber swings the dispatch. It finds The Thracian's jaw, 
  snapping his head from the impact. His eyes unfocus, legs 
  turning to jelly as the Soldiers release him.

  THE THRACIAN FALLS,

  the ground below him transforming into the INKY BLACK ABYSS 
  of unconsciousness. He tumbles down into it, swallowed by

  THE VOID,

  vast and impenetrable. A beat. A SOUND RISES: the CREAKING 
  of WOOD. A DROP OF WATER hits the void, rippling and 
  dissolving the darkness to reveal an ECU of

  THE THRACIAN,

  battered and unconscious. WATER drips on his face, 
  refreshing the dried, caked blood. PULL BACK to reveal we 
  are now --



  The harsh sun scorches Ilithyia, Glaber's wife, as she 
  stands on the balcony, lost in thought. A breeze stirs her 
  hair. She closes her eyes, hoping it will cool the sweat 
  staining her face. A beat.

  A HAND APPEARS

  into FRAME, reaching out to touch her cheek. As it makes 
  contact she jolts back, her eyes crashing open to find

  GLABER

  now standing beside her. He smiles playfully.

                                        GLABER
                        What if I'd been an assassin?

  Ilithyia flings herself at him. She finds his mouth, devours 
  it.

                        Father's in town. He'll be back

                        How shortly?

  His hand slips down to explore just how excited she is to 
  see him. She giggles, slipping from his grasp.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        He's not very happy with you.

  Her face slips into concern. And disappointment.

  Glaber turns away, looking out across the city.

                        crowd, and the senate will beg to 
                        follow.

  A COMMOTION ERUPTS from inside the villa. The angry voice of 
  SENATOR ALBINIUS, barely discernible, rumbles like distant 
  thunder.

  She heads inside with a smile, WIPING US TO --



  A courtyard has been lavishly appointed for the Cena Libera, 
  the outrageously indulgent feast the night before the munus 
    (gladiatorial games). MUSIC plays. GUESTS bray as they eat 
  and fuck. NAKED SLAVES offer epicurean oddities. Precious 
  WATER flows freely.

  SENATOR ALBINIUS

  steps into FRAME, commanding attention.

                                          SENATOR ALBINIUS
                        Good citizens of Capua! Revered 
                        guests! Ancient friends!

  Albinius nods at a WIZENED MAN with a great WHITE BEARD. The 
  Guests LAUGH.

                                          SENATOR ALBINIUS(cont'd)
                        A debt of gratitude for partaking 
                      in this celebration of the family 
                        name of Albinius!

                                        CROWD
                        Albinius! Albinius!

                        Your attendance honors the memory 
                      of my elders, gone too soon from 
                        the realm of the living, and the 
                        joy of a daughter, yet so full of 
                        life.

  He indicates Ilithyia, a vision in her intricate gown. She 
  glows at the compliment.

                                          SENATOR ALBINIUS(cont'd)
                        I repay your kindness with gifts of 
                        water! Carried from Rome where the 
                        gods have seen fit to keep the 
                        drought at bay! And gifts of blood, 
                      to be spilled in the arena!

  The Guests cheer.

                                        CROWD
                        Albinius! Good Albinius!

                        Quintus Lentulus Batiatus! Step 
                        forward and present your 
                        gladiators!

  BATIATUS, a thick, boisterous man in his 50s, appears on a 
  platform in the center of the courtyard.

                                        BATIATUS
                      In honor of Senator Albinius and 
                        the people of Capua, I give you 
                        Barca! The Beast of Carthage!

  The Guests applaud as BARCA, a wild giant of a man, climbs 
  the platform. He grunts, grinning viciously for their 
  amusement.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yet his ferocity pales against the 
                        titan of the arena! The god of 
                        blood and sand! Crixus! The 
                        undefeated Gaul!

  CRIXUS takes his place besides Barca. Smaller than Barca but 
  more powerfully built, Crixus radiates calm, deadly menace. 
  The Guests greet him with cheers.

                                          SENATOR ALBINIUS
                        Gratitude to Batiatus! Now to 
                        Marcus Decius Solonius, and his 
                        offerings!

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

  Batiatus and his men move off as SOLONIUS, mid 40s, a tall, 
  severe man with a shaved head takes the platform.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      In honor of Senator Albinius and 
                        the people of Capua, I give you six 
                      of my finest men! Behold Arkadios! 
                        Scourge of Athens!

  ARKADIOS, an ugly, scarred brute, takes the platform to the 
  cheers of the crowd. Batiatus joins his wife LUCRETIA, a 
  striking woman very much his junior.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A Greek! The bald headed cock 
                        offers a common Greek! Like digging 
                      in the backyard to provide dinner 
                        for your guests.

                                        LUCRETIA

                        I promise many things. And keep 
                        fewer.

  Batiatus glares over at Solonius. The man continues 
  introducing his gladiators in the background.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Preening shit eater. A mockery to

                        the pulvinus.

                        and everyone shits gold.

  Solonius finishes presenting his last man. The crowd cheers, 
  laughing and drinking.

                                          SENATOR ALBINIUS
                        Gratitude to Solonius! But water 
                        and games are distant praise for 
                        the city that has held the name 
                        Albinius as its own. More is 
                        deserved! And the gods have seen 
                        fit to bestow it in the form of my 
                        daughter's husband, Legatus 
                        Claudius Glaber, newly returned 
                        from the savage lands of Thrace!

  Albinius waves his hand, directing the crowd to Glaber as he 
  enters with his Soldiers. The Thracian prisoners are 
  presented in his wake.

  THE PRISONERS

  eye the scene, overwhelmed -- except for The Thracian, who 
  stares with dead, lifeless eyes. The crowd TITTERS.

                                        GLABER
                        More gifts for the people of Capua!

                        Getae! To be executed ad gladium in 
                        tomorrow's games!

  CHEERS of excitement as the Guests crowd for a better look. 
  Glaber basks in the triumph. Ilithyia beams, taking her 
  father's arm.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      He is well received.

  Albinius' senatorial smile belies a deeper displeasure.

                        Ask favor for him again, and your

                        Come! Let us have music and drink!

  Albinius disengages from her, turning his back to the 
  Thracian spectacle. Glaber's joy is tempered by the sight.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

  Thracians.

  He smiles politely, moving after Albinius. The Fat Man 
  tosses the decimated bone in the dirt at the prisoners' 
  feet. Byzo dives for it.

  DRENIS

  yanks the chain connecting him, snapping Byzo back before he 
  can seize the prize. The Romans LAUGH.

  Drenis shoots him a look. The Thracian stares off. Byzo 
  hesitates, then falls on his last meal, not even bothering 
  to wipe the dirt from it.

  THE CLASH OF WOODEN SWORDS

  draws The Thracian's attention to Arkadios and another of 
  Solonius' men atop the platform. A demonstration in fighting 
  techniques for the pleasure of the crowd. Batiatus passes 
  with Lucretia, eyeing the Thracians.

                        Glaber mentions execution. Perhaps 
                        a word could lend our men to the 
                        task.

                        The position has been occupied.

  Batiatus turns to find Solonius, his rival, near at hand. 
  Batiatus instantly shifts into a mask of delight.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Good Solonius! I was just marveling 
                      at your wares!

                          I appreciate.

  He turns his attention to Batiatus.

                        Good to lay eyes, old friend. I

                        excluded.

                        The dawn without the sun!

  Solonius casts an eye towards Crixus and Barca, on display 
  for the admiring guests.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Crixus and Barca. Two fine entries. 
                        They should provide distraction 
                        between the more important bouts.

                        proceedings.

  Solonius catches sight of Albinius across the way with 
  Ilithyia and Glaber, motioning him over.

                        I will pleasantly grip the knife.

  Lucretia moves off with Batiatus, revealing

  THE THRACIAN

  staring dispassionately from across the courtyard. Byzo 
  gawks slack-jawed at the debauchery of the Cena Libera.

                                        BYZO
                        I've never beheld such sights.

                        Nor will you again.

  Drenis darkens, feeling the hand of death closing near. The 
  Thracian glances at him, but there are no words left of 
  meaning. He looks away, his eyes falling on


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.
  CONTINUED:

  ARKADIOS

  still engaged in mock combat. Arkadios catches the look. He 
  grins at The Thracian, the promise of death flashing in it. 
  As the wooden swords crash against each other they MORPH 
  INTO STEEL, TRANSITIONING us to --



  The CROWD HOWLS as Arkadios (the Murmillo Gladiator) toys 
  with a bloodied Drenis (bringing us full circle to the 
  beginning of the episode). DRIFT AWAY from the battle, 
  moving across the arena to find

  THE THRACIAN

  standing behind the bars of the PRISON PEN set into the 
  arena wall, watching Drenis struggle for his life. He 
  glances back, revealing

  THE MANGLED BODIES

  of Byzo and the other Thracian deserters littering the floor 
  of the pen. They've already stepped into the arena. And 
  fared poorly. The ROAR of the CROWD pulls him back with hope 
  to THE ARENA

  where Drenis surges forward, attacking. Arkadios expertly 
  counters, swinging around and SLICING OPEN Drenis' arm. He 
  grunts in pain, recovers to attack.

  ARKADIOS

  counters, his sword catching the sun as it finds Drenis' 
  neck, opening it to the bone in a SPRAY OF BLOOD. Drenis 
  falls to his knees, forcing a last defiant smile before 
  giving himself to the sand.

  THE CROWD ROARS

  as LIBITINARII, the men in charge of clearing the corpses, 
  rush in to carry off Drenis' body. Arkadios raises his sword 
  in salute to

  THE PULVINUS,

  literally the "pillow of honor," the ancient equivalent to a 
  sky box. Glaber acknowledges Arkadios to the cheers of the 
  people. Ilithyia glows next to him. Albinius smiles 
  politely. A crush of other honored guests crowd the 
  pulvinus, including Batiatus, Lucretia and Solonius, seated 
  in the second row behind Albinius.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                        the last...

  THE ARENA

  The gate to the prison pen grinds open. The Thracian steps 
  out with his sword, disoriented by the sun and the crowd. 
  Arkadios waves him forward. Time to die. The Thracian's hand 
  tightens on his sword. He steps forward to meet his fate, 
  but as he does

  THREE MORE GLADIATORS

  hustle into the ring, surrounding the Thracian. Each 
  Gladiator is from a different classification: SECUTOR (axe), 
  HOPLOMACHUS (spear), and RETIARIUS (trident and net).

  THE CROWD MURMURS

  in disapproval. Four against one. Unfair, and very unRoman.

  THE PULVINUS

  Albinius echoes the sentiment of the crowd, turning his 
  barely contained ire towards Glaber.

                                        ALBINIUS
                        The odds seem out of favor.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        This Thracian caused Rome a great 
                        disservice, father.

                                        GLABER
                        His cowardice led to mass 
                        desertion.

                                        ALBINIUS
                      Is his life not ample repayment of 
                        the slight?

                                        GLABER
                      He must be humiliated in example. 
                        Solonius was kind enough to offer 
                        his services in the act.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

  Solonius grins uncomfortably, makes a gesture of apology 
  under Albinius' withering glare.

                        Give the command.

  Glaber motions the Gladiators to commence.

  THE ARENA

  The Thracian turns, trying to keep each of the Gladiators in 
  check as they close in. The Retiarius swings his NET lazily 
  overhead, the checkerboard SHADOW ebbing and flowing across 
  The Thracian's sweat drenched face.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as the Hoplomachus begins the attack, thrusting his spear 
  out. The Thracian SNAPS his head out of the way, SWEAT 
  erupting from the force. He counters, spinning to KICK the 
  Hoplomachus back.

  THE RETIARIUS

  sweeps in with his net, catching The Thracian's foot and 
  YANKING him from his feet. He crashes to the sand, narrowly 
  rolling out of the way as Arkadios thrusts down with his 
  sword.

  THE THRACIAN'S BLADE

  flashes out, cutting him free of the net. He rolls to his 
  feet but is instantly set upon by the Secutor. The Thracian 
  is knocked off balance.

  THE HOPLOMACHUS SWINGS HIS SPEAR,

  the arc of the tip OPENING A GASH across The Thracian's 
  back.

  THE PULVINUS

  Glaber grins in satisfaction. Albinius is unreadable. 
  Batiatus less so.

                                        BATIATUS

  CONTINUED:

  THE ARENA

  The Gladiators play cat and bloody mouse with The Thracian, 
  opening up repeated wounds on his ravaged body. The Thracian 
  tries to rally, but Arkadios slams him with his shield.

  THE THRACIAN FALLS TO HIS KNEES

  in the blood-soaked sand. The BOO of the Crowd FADES from 
  The Thracian's ears, replaced by the SOUND of his own 
  LABORED BREATHING. His eyes unfocus as he struggles to 
  retain consciousness.

  A DROPLET OF BLOOD

  breaks free from his face -- but never makes it to the 
  ground. Instead it slows, hanging impossibly in mid-air. The 
  Thracian stares in hallucinatory wonder as

  BLOOD RISES

  like steam from the sand to join the droplet, twisting 
  together to form A GREAT RED SERPENT

  writhing in the air. Sura's spectral vision. The Thracian 
  stares at it in wonder, the words of his wife carried on the 
  hot breeze:

                                        SURA'S VOICE
                                  a whisper)(
                        Kill them all...

  The Thracian grits his teeth, drawing strength from her 
  words. As he focuses through the pain, the RED SERPENT 
  dissipates, MORPHING into

  A SNAKE STANDARD

  carved into Arkadios' shield. Splattered with blood, the 
    snake-adorned shield has taken on the deep red hue of Sura's 
  vision.

  THE DROPLET OF BLOOD

  from The Thracian's face resumes its journey, falling to the 
  sand. The SOUNDS of the ARENA crash back up as Arkadios 
  raises his sword for the death blow.

  THE THRACIAN EXPLODES,

  his own blade flashing in the sun as he RUNS ARKADIOS 
  THROUGH THE GUT with his sword. The crowd goes silent. A 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

  frozen moment. The Thracian breaks it by rearing to his feet 
  and

  SPLITTING ARKADIOS IN HALF

  from belly to shoulder as he yanks his sword up in a SPRAY 
  OF BLOOD and INTERNAL ORGANS. The crowd erupts, ROARING 
  their approval. The Thracian gains strength from it, 
  engaging the remaining three Gladiators with renewed 
  purpose.

  THE PULVINUS

  Glaber tenses. Ilithyia shares his concern.

  THE ARENA

  The Thracian trades blows with the remaining three 
  Gladiators in a display of raw savagery. The Secutor rears 
  back and

  HURLS HIS AXE

  at The Thracian's head. TIME SLOWS. The Thracian barely 
  bends out of the way. As the axe passes in front of his 
  face, he sees

  THE REFLECTION OF THE RETIARIUS

  raising his trident to attack from behind. TIME RESUMES. The 
  AXE whizzes past The Thracian, accidentally

  SLAMMING INTO THE HOPLOMACHUS,

  killing him instantly.

  THE RETIARIUS

  thrusts his trident at The Thracian's back, but he whirls, 
  diving under it. The Thracian swings his sword and

  CLEANLY SEVERS THE LEGS

  out from under the Retiarius. The Retiarius screams, blood 
  spraying as he falls to the sand.

  THE SECUTOR

  desperately tries to yank his axe free from his fallen 
  comrade's chest as the Thracian rises, dripping with blood 
  and gore, his eyes burning. Just as the Secutor frees his 
  axe THE THRACIAN HURLS HIS SWORD,


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

  SPEWING BLOOD from his helmet as he dies. The crowd goes 
  insane.

  THE RETIARIUS,

  tries to crawl away, his severed legs leaving a trail of 
  gore like a great injured slug. The Thracian retrieves the 
  fallen trident and

  SLAMS IT INTO THE RETIARIUS' SKULL,

  pinning the man to the ground. He twitches, goes still. The 
  CROWD ROARS. The Thracian sways, more dead than alive as he 
  locks eyes with

  GLABER

  in the Pulvinus. Glaber fumes. Albinius gauges the approval 
  of the crowd.

                        crowd... Unwise. Even for a 
                        senator.

  Glaber erupts, unable to hold his fury in check.

                      He gave me grievance! I will not

  Batiatus, sensing opportunity, interjects.

                        A solution, perhaps, if you will

                        shown promise in the arena -- 
                        albeit against Solonius' inferior 
                        stock.

  Glaber starts to protest, but the shouts of the crowd still 
  his tongue. He lowers his eyes, acquiescing. Albinius rises.

                                        ALBINIUS
                      We will be merciful. And by such 
                        gain the favor you seek.

  He turns to address the crowd, pauses.

                                          ALBINIUS(cont'd)
                        What name does the man carry?

                                        GLABER
                        I never cared to ask.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The way he fights -- like the 
                        legend of the Thracian King of old. 
                        Spartacus, he was called.

  Albinius smiles, raises his hands to the crowd.

                                        ALBINIUS
                        People of Capua! This man -- this 
                        Spartacus -- has proven himself in 
                        the arena. For this... Legatus 
                        Claudius Glaber and I grant him 
                        LIFE!

  THE ARENA

  The thunderous CHEER of the crowd assaults The Thracian, now 
  forever known to history as SPARTACUS. He stares up at them 
  through the haze of blood and pain.

  THE LIBITINARII

  swarm in as he collapses, finally succumbing to his wounds.

  OVERHEAD SHOT

  looking straight down as the Libitinarii hoist the 
    semiconscious Spartacus up. They carry him Christ-like from 
  the arena as the Crowd chants his name.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                                        CROWD
                        Spartacus... Spartacus... 
                        Spartacus...

  His eyes flutter shut, plunging us into DARKNESS.


  BLACKOUT.
