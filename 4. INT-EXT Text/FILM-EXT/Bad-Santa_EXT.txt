It looks like a warm cozy place out of "It's A Wonderful
Life". The window is flocked with fake snow, and hung with
colorful Christmas lights, wreaths and ornaments.
CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN
DISSOLVE TO:
Santa staggers out the back door...
CAMERA FOLLOWS BEHIND HIM still hiding his face.
Santa gets about ten feet, then pauses and leans with one
hand against the alley wall, uses the other to hold his pom-
pom out of the way, and vomits.
Having vomited, and spit, he staggers off toward the street.
SUPERED TITLE OF THE MOVIE:
BAD SANTA
Wintry night. Ray Coniff's "Jolly Ole Saint Nicholas" scores
views of the downtown blanketed in snow and decorated for
the holiday. It is Christmas Eve, and the sidewalks throng
with people rushing to do their last-minute shopping.
A MOTHER and her two absurdly bundled CHILDREN emerge from
the crowd.
MOTHER
Hurry boys, we're gonna miss Santa!
She drags them across the street
toward the looming art-deco monolith
that is the big-city department store.
Marcus and Willie wheel out two carts and roll them through
the open doors of a waiting van. As they slam the doors --
The van speeds away through the Christmas Eve night and
disappears into the distance, like the down of a thistle.
FADE OUT:
CAMERA ROCKETS INTO C.U. of An alarm clock ringing with a
jolt.
Willie, sipping a cup of coffee, meanders down the street
scratching his ass.
Willie's walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime. As
he passes, he casually snatches a handful of car keys from
the parking valet key-box and moves on.
As he rounds the corner into the lot he pushes on the various
key fobs, identifying various cars when their alarms chirp.
He seems dissatisfied until a brand new Cadillac chirps.
Willie gets in and drives off.
To the chimey chords of "Sleigh Ride," we see Phoenix, Arizona
in MONTAGE / dressed for Christmas but sweltering under its
oppressive winter heat.
Through the heat ripples rising off the pavement two mirage-
like figures cross the infinite asphalt of the Saguaro Square
Mall parking lot -- Willie and Marcus in Santa and Elf
regalia, sweating and panting in the heat. Willie polishes
off a pint of Smirnoff's and flips it towards a nearby trash
can. It misses and breaks loudly on the pavement.
MARCUS
Jesus Christ! Can you maybe keep it
together for just ten minutes?!
He pulls some Tic Tacs out of his pocket.
MARCUS
For crying out loud, chew a few of
these... you drunken, fuckin'
imbecile!
Anchoring the huge mall complex is the large and upscale
Chamberlain's Department Store.
On the outskirts of the Saguaro Square Mall's parking lot a
city bus stops with a hiss. The doors swing open to reveal a
pathetic EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID, overweight, snot-nosed, badly
dressed and probably smelling of pee.
As the kid nears the mall entrance he passes a group of older
children doing skateboard stunts. They notice him.
KID
Loser!
One of them throws an empty can that hits him in the head.
The kid walks on, it seems without noticing.
The bullies, disheartened by the lack of reaction, go back
to their skateboarding.
The Kid sits on a bench watching the entrance to
Chamberlain's. After a beat Willie and Marcus walk out in
costume and cross toward the parking lot.
The Kid follows from a safe distance.
Willie and Marcus walk across the huge empty parking lot,
followed at a great distance by the Kid.
They arrive at their cars -- Marcus' van and a beat-up old
Chrysler that is Willie's -- parked next to each other.
As the Kid creeps closer, he is able to hear their
conversation.
Willie motions to the Black Angus in the parking lot.
WILLIE
I gotta get a drink on. See ya
tomorrow.
MARCUS
Just don't come in to work stinkin'
of booze again.
WILLIE
Don't worry about me. Get going,
you'll be late for your Wizard of Oz
Candy Bar Guild thing.
MARCUS
Lollipop Guild, asshole. Jesus, two
year olds flip me shit better'n you.
WILLIE
You tryin' to say something to me?
MARCUS
(pauses, then
deliberately)
Yeah. I'm gonna stick my whole fist
up your ass.
In the parking lot the barmaid finishes straightening her
clothes and touching up her lipstick in the rearview mirror.
Willie, leaning against his car, still in his Santa suit,
fires up a post-coital cigarette.
SUE
I got a thing for Santa Claus, I
don't know, I guess it's from early
childhood.
WILLIE
(taking a swig)
Yeah, so's my thing for tits.
SUE
Maybe because my parents were Jewish
and never celebrated Christmas. Santa
was sort of forbidden, you know?
She gets out of the car.
SUE
I like you. Most of the people around
here are pretty uptight. My name is
Sue. Here's my number.
She hands him the slip of paper and ambles off, calling back
over her shoulder:
SUE
...Don't mothball that suit!
Willie, nodding understanding, turns to reach for his car
door and --
TROUBLEMAKER
I AM NOT GAY!!
-- the accompanying PAN OVER brings in the screaming
homophobe.
WILLIE
Whoa-Jesus! All right buddy, that's
it...
TROUBLEMAKER
Buddy? I said, I am not gay!
WILLIE
Look, what's the problem pal, you go
off your meds?
The man stares at him for a beat.
TROUBLEMAKER
...Yes, but this isn't about that!
You are queer as a ten dollar bill.
WILLIE
Now you listen. My brother lost an
arm fighting you people in Vietnam,
so I want you to take a good hard
look at this face...
Willie pulls back a fist.
WILLIE
...'cause it's the last fuckin' thing
you're gonna see before I knock your
head off and sh --
WHACK-WHACK-WHACK-WHACK-WHACK! The man surprises Willie with
a flurry of effective punches. In moments, Willie is on the
losing end of homosexual panic.
TROUBLEMAKER
Who is the bitch now, fat man?!
PIPING VOICE (O.S.)
Leave Santa alone!
The Troublemaker stops and looks down to find the Kid beating
on his legs.
TROUBLEMAKER
Please little boy, I am doing this
for all of us!
Willie gets a chance to regain composure. He wipes the blood
from his mouth, raises his fists and... promptly collapses.
TROUBLEMAKER
I think he has finished his cruising
for tonight, hm?
The Hindustani hothead wanders off. The Kid shuffles over to
the prone Willie.
WILLIE
You.
Willie escorts the Kid along a long walkway that leads to
the front door of a large, opulent, new-money Southwestern
home.
Willie admires the surroundings.
WILLIE
Nice digs. Daddy home?
KID
He's on a adventure 'sploring
mountains. He been gone a long time.
WILLIE
Exploring mountains? When's he coming
back?
KID
Next year.
WILLIE
What about Mommy?
KID
She lives in God's house with Jesus
and Mary and the Ghost and the long-
eared donkey and Joseph and the
talking walnut.
WILLIE
Who the fuck takes care of you then?
KID
Granma.
WILLIE
(hatching an idea)
Really... What's her name?
KID
Granma.
As the Kid lets himself in Willie pulls out a black ski mask
and puts it on his head like a stocking cap.
WILLIE
Uh-huh. Is Granny spry?
He unrolls the mask to cover his face and takes out a
blackjack.
At the cut a new Mercedes screeches through the frame and,
as we hear it recede, we are left looking at the kid, who
stands at the curb, waving happily.
KID
Bye Santa!
Willie and Marcus walk to their cars.
MARCUS
That's just the kinda shit that's
gonna get us pinched!
WILLIE
(apologetic)
She said she was eighteen.
MARCUS
You promised no arcades! You said
you'd only hustle Big & Tall!
WILLIE
Ah, it's like shooting fish in a
barrel -- there's no sport,
MARCUS
How many times, you fuck? "The bigger
the store, the bigger the take."
Well, we can't work the big stores
with your big fucking train wrecks!
WILLIE
(pulling out his keys)
You got some nerve you little shit
ya! You my mom now?! You shat me out
your womb, is that it? You gotta
take care of me!? Well I can take
care of myself and I don't need no
lectures! I know how to keep a low
profile!
BOOP-BOOP! Willie uses his key fob to deactivate the car
alarm to the Mercedes.
MARCUS
What the fuck is this?!
WILLIE
Mind your own fucking business.
Willie opens the door and an avalanche of beer bottle empties
tumbles out, rolling everywhere.
MARCUS
You cocksucker!
Willie starts the engine and pulls out, and Marcus yells to
the receding car:
MARCUS
...EVER HEAR OF THE OPEN-BOTTLE LAW?!
(then, to himself)
-- You dumb Dipshit Motherfucker!
Willie parks the Mercedes in the front of a rundown motel
complex. He walks past hookers and junkies until he gets to
his unit.
He pulls out his key and just as he's about to insert it in
the lock he sees a flashlight beam shining inside the window.
Surprised, he backs off cautiously and presses up against
the wall.
Someone inside is rifling the room.
Willie hisses at a nearby hooker:
WILLIE
Opal, come here.
Opal looks at him with disdain.
OPAL
Screw you, Willie -- last time I
didn't shit right for a week.
WILLIE
No, not that -- come here!
Reluctantly, she sidles over.
WILLIE
Who the fuck's in my room, did you
see someone go into my fuckin' room?
OPAL
Yeah some guy askin' 'boutcha --
looked like a cop.
WILLIE
Ah fuck.
Willie is at a pay phone.
WILLIE
No, I think it's a cop though. You
think someone's onto us?
MARCUS
Is there anything in the room?
Anything professional?
WILLIE
No. Clothes.
MARCUS
Just ditch. You got anywhere to sack
out for a while?
Churning water.
The sloshing of water is now accompanied by a rhythmic
slapping sound.
Willie bangs Sue in the Jacuzzi. He is wearing his Santa
hat.
SUE
YES! YES! YES SANTA YES!
It is early morning and the parking lot is empty except for
Marcus' van. The Mercedes eventually pulls in, parking beside
him. Windows roll down. In the driver's seat, Marcus looks
up from his watch with a scowl.
MARCUS
You're late.
VAN DOORS
Marcus throws open the back of the van, revealing the
components of the water drill in various prop gift boxes.
Willie wears a forbearing smile:
WILLIE
Kids, lemmme tell ya...
He shakes his head and chuckles as Marcus tosses him an empty
red Santa sack.
WILLIE
...They'll run ya ragged.
Marcus stares.
Jesse, the security guard unlocks the door and opens up for
Willie and Marcus. They enter in costume. Willie lugs the
filled sack and seems to be straining.
JESSE
Morning boys.
MARCUS
Morning Jesse.
JESSE
(to Willie)
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Willie pants under the weight of his bag:
WILLIE
Up your ass.
As Willie and Marcus enter the store Gin Slagel drives by
their cars, carefully noting their tags.
Lois exits an electronics store with a box slung under her
arm, her mouth turned down in pruney disapproval. She places
the box on the hood of her car and we see its printings SONY
HVR-3200.
She opens the box, fishes out the remote, then tosses the
box and VCR into a nearby trash can.
Gin Slagel walks through the main gate of the heavily
fortified penitentiary, leaving a huge trail of cigarette
smoke.
A bus clears frame, revealing the kid as he walks toward the
mall.
VOICES
Loser! Dipshit!
CLANG! The kid is hit in the head with a can again. Again,
no reaction.
Someone in the group of frustrated bullies has a fresh idea:
VOICE
Wedgie!
Cheering, the six bullies engulf the kid.
We are pulling an eight-year-old child who rides his bicycle
along the sidewalk, looking off, struck by what he sees.
He slows and then comes to a stop having pulled even with a
group of other children gathered on the sidewalk also looking
off at the same spot. They stare for a good long beat,
expressions rather neutral. But the sight, whatever it is,
holds their attention.
Finally one in the foreground remarks:
KID
I didn't know he did that.
Their POV: rather distant, on a grassy hill a man in a Santa
suit is pounding the shit out of the bullies. One of the
bullies throws a punch, but Santa grabs his fist and pushes
him down. Santa puts his foot on another bully's butt and
sends him flying. After more wrestling and flinging about,
the bullies wind up in a heap on the ground.
Marcus stands by the side of his van. It's parked on the
shoulder with the hood up, jumper cables attached and hanging.
Lois is in the driver's seat.
Gin's Ford 4 X 4 speeds around the corner and Marcus flags
him down.
SCREEEEECH! Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls
over. He emerges from the 4 X 4 with road rage on full brew,
and strides over to the van.
GIN
Jesus, Mother Mary and Joseph! What
in the name of the holy lord Fuck is
the problem now?
MARCUS
Sorry, the van stalled. Give us a
jump will ya?
GIN
Well, I'll be dipped in dogshit!...
What am I, your auto mechanic now?
He shakes his head in disgust. Grumbling, he goes back to
the 4 X 4 and drives it into position. He gets out and raises
the hood.
The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet
apart as Gin opens the hood.
GIN
(motions to his battery)
Help yourself, small fry.
Marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery
terminals.
MARCUS
It's hard for me to reach...
Gin grabs the cables from him. Marcus takes a few steps back.
GIN
Jesus Christ, give me those!
MARCUS
Thanks.
Gin attaches the cables.
GIN
(then, to Lois)
Alright, TRY IT!
Lois turns the key and the van starts right up. Gin takes
the cables off the van and closes the hood. He lights up a
Pall Mall.
Marcus signals to Lois. She puts the car into gear and stomps
her foot on the accelerator, squashing Gin between the two
vehicles.
ANGLE PROM INSIDE VAN (SLOW MOTION):
Gin's face as it's squooshed up against the van's windshield.
A cloud of cigarette smoke escapes his lips.
Lois continues to step on the gas, trying to crush him.
ANGLE ON: the tires spinning in the gravel.
Finally, she takes her foot off the gas. The van eases back.
Gin falls to the ground with a groan. Marcus steps up and
leans over him.
MARCUS
Oh my, what a terrible accident!
LOIS
Is he dead?
MARCUS
No, but it looks like you broke most
of his ribs.
Then, leaning down to Gin.
MARCUS
(for Gin's benefit)
I'd say maybe... fifty percent of
them? Or do you think thirty percent?
LOIS
I needed more of a running start --
I couldn't build up any speed.
Marcus paces around trying to figure out what to do next.
MARCUS
(shaking his head in
dismay)
Motherfuck!
He grabs the jumper cables still connected to Gin's 4 X 4
and clamps the other ends on Gin's ears. A small jolt and a
spark or two. Only a minor shock.
MARCUS
Shit!
He grabs Gin's arm and with great effort drags him over a
few feet so that his head is positioned behind the front
tire of the van. Gin tries to crawl out of the way.
ANGLE ON: Gin's feet slipping on the gravel.
MARCUS
Put it in reverse.
ANGLE ON: shift level moving into REVERSE.
ANGLE ON: Lois' foot stepping on the gas pedal.
WIDER: Lois drives backwards. There's a bump and the sound
of a dull POP.
CUT TO:
CLOSE-UP: A large bubble gum bubble pops.
Willie, in a self-medicated stupor, barely managing to hold
a wailing toddler on his lap. Bubble gum is all over the
Kid's face.
WILLIE
'Tendo it is.
He passes the child off to Marcus, who holds it as Willie
gazes off and murmurs;
WILLIE
...Everything I touch turns to shit
and dies.
Marcus, still holding the child, quickly glances around, and
then hisses into Willie's ear:
MARCUS
What are you, drinking Sterno now?
'Cause you're sounding like my Aunt
Tilly right before she smeared her
own shit on the bedroom walls and we
had to lock her up and she spent the
rest of her life with a shaved head
and eating lunch through a tube up
her nose...
Willie continues to stare, head swaying.
MARCUS
...You better be in shape by this
evening, fat man. After tonight, I
don't give a shit. But this is the
time to reach deep down and suck it
up.
Marcus hands the kid to his Mother. He smiles warmly.
MARCUS
...Lovely boy.
Willie bursts out onto the loading dock still holding the
elephant. He dives into his Mercedes and peels out.
Rounding the corner of the loading dock, Willie comes upon a
fleet of squad cars idling in the street. Cops yell, draw
their guns and fire as Willie clips a couple cars, skids and
slues, and finally is clear of the pack.
He roars up the road as policemen leap for their vehicles,
crank up their sirens and pursue.
Willie's car corners onto Sage Terrace on two wheels, slams
back down onto four, fishtails up to the kid's house and
squeals braking into its driveway.
The police vehicles, in hot pursuit, squeal, skid, and slew
around in a jumble at the foot of the lawn. Cops leap out of
their cars just as Willie jumps from his.
MEGAPHONE VOICE
Halt, put your hands up!
Willie is sprinting up the walk toward the front door. His
voice echoes lone and weak after the boom of the megaphone:
WILLIE
Up your ass!
He bounds up the stoop.
POLICE VOICE
All right, boys -- nail him!
A ripple of gunfire.
At the top of the stoop, facing the door, Willie staggers,
rolls his eyes, and -- drops.
NEARBY WINDOW
Drawn by the noise, an adorable six-year-old in a nearby
house slides open his second-story bedroom window to look.
HIS HIGH POV:
Frozen in a semi-circle at the foot of the neighboring lawn,
an army of cops has guns trained on the felled Santa Claus,
who is sprawled on the neighbor's stoop, motionless. His
hand stretches toward the front door holding a fluffy pink
elephant un-delivered...
The six year old draws in his breath and SCREAMS.
He is joined by his equally adorable little brother and sister
who look, and SCREAM, with him.
Somewhere, a neighborhood dog barks.
A Cop looks up at the window and the three shrieking children.
COP
Somebody put a zipper on those fuckin'
kids!
FADE OUT:
