      Claire moves through the store, climbs a flight of stairs.


      Claire enters a glassed-in private room. CAMERA STAYS on a 
      sign on the door that reads,  Mondays -- Mystery Readers Book 
      Club; Tuesdays -- Dr. Claire Allen, Dating for Life. 


    An eclectic group of singles are seated in furniture angled 
      toward Allen. A flannel shirt-wearing GUY S GUY has floor.

                                  GUY S GUY
                    Everyone see the Hollywood sign 
                    tonight? Someone sgot cojones.

                                    JUST-OFF-THE-BUS INGENUE
                    Out there somewhere, there s a 
                    Holly realizing -- someone loves 
                    me. It s terribly romantic. Don t 
                    you think, Dr. Allen?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   4.


                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t know. I know most of you 
                    regulars have heard me say romance 
                    is in the eye of the beholder.I d 
                    ask myself, if I were this Holly, 
                    what kind of man have I become 
                    involved with? The sort of man who 
                    breaks the law? The sort of man who 
                    won t take no for an answer?

                                    JUST-OFF-THE-BUS INGENUE
                    I guess it s more of a fantasy.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Fantasy is overrated.

    All eyes shift to Prudence (29, Pretty by normal standards. 
      Cute by television standards.) Given the way the others 
      react, we get the sense she isn t one of the regular talkers.

                                  PRUDENCE (CONT D)
                    Sorry. It s just... I m a reporter 
                    for The Times, and I used to work 
                    the police beat. I d get these 
                    calls for violent crimes. I d show 
                    up, and almost without fail the 
                    victim and the perpetrator were 
                    lovers. Pretty soon I figured out 
                    these domestic disputes occurred in 
                    the exact moment that the fantasy
                    of what these people believed their 
                    lives together would be like 
                    crashed into reality of what their 
                    lives had become. That s why these 
                    days my goal is to find a 
                    relationship that doesn t make me 
                    crazy or inconvenienceme.

      Claire s cell phone rings. She looks annoyed, but she checks 
    it. CLOSE ON PHONE: the caller ID says  HOSPITAL. 

                                  CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)
                    What is it? I m in a meeting?

                                  DR. GREENBURG (O.S.)
                    Claire, we need you to come down 
                    here. Tonight, if possible.

                                  CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)
                    Why? McCormack s on call.

                                  DR. GREENBURG (O.S.)
                    Yeah, but you won t want to miss 
                    this one. He s right up your alley.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   5.



      Claire walks with her colleague, DR. CHARLES GREENBURG (50s.) 
      Claire references a folder in her hand. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    This is the guy who changed the 
                    Hollywood sign?

                                  DR. GREENBURG
                    Not the guy; the god.

      Claire shoots Greenburg a  what the hell?  look.Greenburg 
      points further down the file. Claire reads; her eyes go wide.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Really?

      Greenburg hands over a plastic bag containing several items.

                                  DR. GREENBURG
                    No ID. That s all he had on him. 
                    Chapstick, balloons, a novelty pen,  
                    and a feather. How s the follow up 
                    to your first book coming?

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s not. I m mediating a singles 
                    group hoping that I ll find 
                    inspiration. So far, nada.I may 
                    have to return the advance money.

                                  DR. GREENBURG
                    Keep the advance, Claire. There s a 
                    best seller waiting in your office.


      Cupid sits in a chair across from a desk. An orderly, ISAAC, 
      stands behind him. Claire enters, moves toward her desk.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hello, Mr...?

                                  CUPID
                    It s Cupid.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Cupid. I m Claire Allen, one of the 
                    doctors here.

                                  CUPID
                    Then I suppose you d like me to 
                    disrobe.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   6.


      Cupid begins taking off his shirt. Isaac steps toward him, 
    but Claire shakes her head. She can handle it.

                                  CLAIRE
                    That won t be necessary. Isaac, I m 
                    fine here.

                                  ISAAC
                    I ll be just outside the door.

      Isaac gives Trevor a warning look on his way out.

                                  CUPID
                    I thought he d never leave. So, 
                    where were we? That s right! We 
                    were about to play doctor.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m going to have to ask you to 
                    refrain from that kind of innuendo.
                    I can t help you until we establish 
                    some boundaries.
                            (indicatingwho s who)
                    Doctor. Patient.

                                  CUPID
                    You want to help me? Get me out of 
                    this place. I ve got a job to do 
                    that I can t get done in here. I m 
                    supposed to be telling Dave s story 
                    to a reporter right now! How s Holly 
                    gonnaknow he s looking for her?

                                  CLAIRE
                    So this is a job? Interesting 
                    choice of words...

                                  CUPID
                      Punishment, more like it. Two 
                    hundred mortals matched. One 
                    hundred happily-ever-aftersbefore 
                    I m allowed back.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Back where?

                                  CUPID
                    Olympus.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Of course.

                                  CUPID
                    You asked.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   7.


      Claire leans back in her chair, kicks her feet up.

                                  CLAIRE
                    So this punishment..? Did you do 
                    something wrong?

                                  CUPID
                    Oh, at my expulsion, they yammered on 
                    about relearning my craft, the 
                    screwed up state of love and romance.
                    Frankly, I had trouble taking the 
                    whole thing seriously.

      Claire catches Trevor admiring her legs, she tucks them under 
    her desk as he answers the question. Trevor doesn t register 
    any embarrassment. If anything, his eyes continue to linger.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Why s that?

                                  CUPID
                    A hundred couples? I used to knock 
                    that out before lunch.

                                  CLAIRE
                    How dyou pull that off.

                                  CUPID
                    My bow. My arrows.
                          (asif to a small child)
                    They re magic.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Do you have those with you now?

                                  CUPID
                    You mean...at this moment?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Maybe you could shoot me, and I d 
                    more fully understand this...magic.

                                  CUPID
                          (perhaps you recrazy)
                    Do you see a bow?

                                  CLAIRE
                    So how long you think this quest 
                    will take you? ...Bowless?

                                  CUPID
                    Ten days..? Two weeks, max.

    Off Cupid, confident, and Claire, moderately amused.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   8.



      Claire walks down the hall, speaks into a micro-recorder.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Four days into observation, patient 
                    presents no relief from his 
                    delusional state. I have no 
                      explanation why such high dosages of 
                      Haloperidol and Risperidonehave 
                    yielded no observable effect at all.

    As Claire walks, she spots Cupid in the REC ROOMplaying ping 
      pongwith Isaac the orderly. She pauses, backs up.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    As a side note: he has managed to 
                    win over much of the staff as well 
                    as most of his fellow patients.


    As Trevor and Isaac volley.

                                  CUPID
                    So, Isaac. Guess who I saw checking 
                    you out at breakfast?
                          (offhis curious look)
                    Marla.
                            (offIssac ssmile)
                    That s what I thought. So what re
                    you gonnado about it?

                                  ISAAC
                    Play it cool, I guess.

                                  CUPID
                    No you re not.

                                  ISAAC
                    I m not?

                                  CUPID
                    No. You re gonnawalk up to her and 
                    tell her the best part of your day 
                    is watching her medicate the old 
                    timers in that big bay window. You 
                    can t go wrong with backlighting 
                    and a white uniform.

                                  ISAAC
                    You noticed that, too. Huh? Man, I 
                    can t tell her that.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   9.


                                  CUPID
                    Tell her you like her lips. Tell her 
                    you d face the Persians at 
                      Thermopylae for one taste. Let her 
                    know that you can feel her eyes on 
                    you, mentally undressing you, 
                    wondering what kind of lover you--

      REVEAL CLAIRE has stepped into the room behind Cupid. The 
      last bit of dialogue was delivered for her benefit.

                                  CLAIRE
                    That lldo, Pig. That lldo.
                            (addressingIsaac)
                    Follow his advice, Isaac, and it s 
                    likely you ll end up facing sexual 
                    harassment charges.

                                  CUPID
                    Who reyou going to listen to, my 
                    man? The God of Love or the 
                    spinster in nurse shoes?

      Isaac is clearly torn which irritates Claire. Finally...

                                  ISAAC
                    Well...she isthe relationship 
                    expert.

                                  CUPID
                          (shocked)
                    She s the what?


    ON AN AMUSED DR. GREENBURG. Walking.

                                  DR. GREENBURG
                    Of course he finds it difficult to 
                    believe you re an expert in the 
                    field of love. He believes he s the 
                    godof love.

    TWO SHOT. Claire is walking and talking with Greenburg.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m not offended, Charles. I m just 
                    suggesting his lack of respect, his 
                    view that I am merely mortal or a 
                    woodland nymph he can charm is 
                      interfering with the therapy. It s 
                    been ten days. I m afraid I need to 
                    be more aggressive in punching

      A PLUMP NURSE steams up to Claire and Greenburg.

                                  PLUMP NURSE
                    Dr. Greenburg. Dr. Allen. We ve got 
                    a bit of a crisis. The patients are 
                    refusing their medication.

      Claire and Greenburg share a puzzled look.

                DR. GREENBURG*CLAIRE*
    All of them?*Why?*


      Claire and Greenburg push into the room to discover CUPID 
      leading a cross section of male mental health patients (not 
      unlike Jack Nicholson s Cuckoo s Nestbrethren) as they 
      collectively belt out the chorus of  All You Need Is Love.  

                        MEN*CUPID*
    All you need is love...*All together now!*

                        MEN*CUPID*
    All you need is love...*Everybody!*

                        MEN*CUPID*
      Love. Love. Love.*She loves you. Yeah. Yeah. *
                                                  Yeah.*

      Claire and Greenburg are momentarily speechless. Finally...

                                  CLAIRE
                    Have an orderly take Patient 245 to 
                    my office.

                                  PLUMP NURSE
                          (confused)
                    You mean Cupid?

      Claire sighs. Her patient is convincing everyone.


      Claire enters her office carrying a mythology textbook.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You know, those patients need more 
                    than love. Many of them need 
                    lithium.

      REVEAL CUPID already seated.

                                  CUPID
                    More of a Stones fan. I get it.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   11.


      Cupid leans forward, takes a FRAMED PHOTOoff Claire s desk.

                                  CUPID (CONT'D)
                    You know, if you just let me out of 
                    here, let me get back to the 
                    business of hooking up human-kind, 
                    you can be free of me. I m starting 
                    to see the pages of a calendar flip 
                    every time I close my eyes.

                    myself aging.

      CLOSE ON THE PHOTO which features a grinning 60-year-oldman 
    on a boat. He s holding up an adorable STUFFED-ANIMAL SHARK.

                    Your husband?

      Claire doesn t take the bait, though she does reach across 
    the desk, take the photo from Cupid and carefully put the 
      photo back in the exact spot it was before.

                                  CLAIRE
                    My dad.

                                  TREVOR
                    He looks fun.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes, my dad is certainly that. No 
                    one can deny that the man is fun.

      Trevor gives Claire a look. Her tone confuses him.

                                  CUPID
                    Nothing wrong with fun.

      Claire takes a beat, decides whether to engage in a discussion 
      about fun. She opts out. Instead she opens the mythology text.

                                  CLAIRE

                    in love with her despite the god s 
                      objections. I can t believe you

                    known myth of Cupid!

                    That never happened.

                    Sure it did. There s the picture.

      Shaken by this news, Cupid glances down at the book. (Careful 
      viewers may note the sketch resembles Claire.)

                                  CUPID
                    You re saying Cupid was married?

    The third person reference makes Claire beam. A breakthrough!

    Off Cupid, troubled.


      CLOSE ON THE TV. Captain Kirkis exhorting the crew.

      ANGLE ON CUPID watching said TV passively. His spark is gone. 

      ACROSS THE ROOM Claire talks to our plump nurse.

                    So no more trouble from him? He s

                    with Dr. Evans.

      Claire nods. It seems that all is well.


      A three-member mental health panel sits at a long table in 
      front of the room. Cupid sits next to Claire facing the 
      panel. He remains passive

                                  CLAIRE
                    ...he demonstrates no danger to 
                    himself or others. Given our 
                    current bed situation, I feel I can 
                    recommend this patient s release 
                    with some degree of confidence.

                    It s Trevor -- Trevor Hale.

      Claire looks at her patient. The news surprises her.

                                  DOCTOR 1
                    Well, good. That eases one of my 
                    qualms. Now, does he have any 
                    money? A place to stay?

                                  CLAIRE
                    We re looking into shelters that--

                                  TREVOR
                    I ve got a place to stay. And I may 
                    still have a job.

                                  DOCTOR 1
                    Excellent. I think I can speak for 
                    the committee when I say we ll 
                    approve the release of Trevor Hale 
                    on a trial basis if you continue to 
                    monitor his progress.

                                  CLAIRE
                    But, uh...

                                  DOCTOR 1
                    To that end, we d like to receive 
                    weekly reports keeping us informed 
                    of the patient s progress.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   15.

                                  DOCTOR 1
                    If you find the patient stops 
                    making progress, he should be 
                    readmitted immediately. Thank you, 
                    Dr. Allen. Next case.

    Off Claire s weary look.

                    I want to find out if there are any 
                    missing person reports for a man

                    I d like to find out if this is the

      Claire hands Digger a picture of Trevor in patient garb.

                    You see, this man is a patient of 
                    mine, and if he turns out to be 
                    Trevor Hale, I might get some 
                    insight on how best to treat him.

                    I could do some additional

                    slip up. They mention a street they 
                    lived on or reference the snow on 
                    the ground. I mean, if he mentions

      Trevor heads past the bar, climbs a spiral staircase that 
      leads to the old projection room now serving as the office.


      Trevor enters and finds bar owner FELIXARROYO (late 20s) 
      chatting with his sister LITA (sexy, 24.) 

                                  TREVOR
                    You re renting out my room?

                                  FELIX
                    You re here a week, then disappear 
                    for two weeks. What was I supposed 
                    to do? Where veyou been?

                                  TREVOR
                    I ve been in the hospital, thank-
                      you-very-much.

                                  FELIX
                    How was I supposed to know that? 
                    Are you okay?

                                  TREVOR
                    I was misdiagnosed. It was nothing.

      Hey! That s my sister.Grow up.*

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    What? The guy at Baja Fresh told me 
                    that s a common Spanish greeting. 
                    So, can I get a new key?

                                  FELIX
                    Do you have the rent?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   20.


                                  TREVOR
                    I will if you let me pick up some 
                    more shifts around here.

      Lita shoots Felix a look, shakes her head.

                                  FELIX
                    We haven t been exactly been 
                    packing them in lately.

                                  TREVOR
                    Keep me on, Chief, and I promise 
                    you ll be packed tonight. Got a 
                    Sharpie on you?

    Off Felix, intrigued.


    PAN OFF A SERIES OF HANDMADE PHOTOCOPIED FLYERS promising 
      half-priced margaritas at TRES EQUIS. PAN FINDS Claire 
      addressing one her singles group women.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Margaret, I respect your decision. 
                    I do. All I m suggesting is that if 
                    you re going to continue to place 
                    an ad in the personals, it might be 
                    wise to mention your chastity 
                    pledge within the text.

      A QUICK PAN for reactions among the group suggests the other 
      attendees are in total agreement. The PAN lands on Trevor and 
      Dave seated together.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    All right. It seems like we have 
                    time for one more person.

      Trevor s hand shoots up. Claire winces.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Trevor, maybe it would be a good 
                    idea if you just audited the first 
                    couple sessions.

                                  TREVOR
                    Not me. My buddy Dave, here.
                    He could use some help.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (relieved)
                    All right. Welcome Dave. Tell us 
                    about your love life.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   21.


                                  DAVE
                    Uh, yeah. Okay. As it turns out, 
                    I ve also been chaste, just over 
                    six months now, though, in my case, 
                      unintentionally.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m not sure what your friend told 
                    you, but we workshop long-term 
                      relationships. We re not here to 
                    facilitate hookups.

                                  DAVE
                    Oh, no. That s not what I meant to 
                    suggest. No, my problem is purely 
                    romantic. Singularly-romantic.

                                  CLAIRE
                    All right, then. I m sorry. Go on.

                                  DAVE
                    Okay... Last Christmas, I was 
                    working at my dad s pub, and this 
                    American woman comes in asking for 
                    directions to Connolly Station. We 
                    spent twenty minutes talking before 
                    she had to go catch a plane home to 
                    Los Angeles, but those twenty 
                    minutes were all it took. We had 
                    this transcendent, palpable 
                      connection. Unfortunately, all I got 
                    was her first name, Holly.

                                    JUST-OFF-THE-BUS INGENUE
                    Oh my god. You re the guy who 
                    changed the Hollywood sign!

                                  DAVE
                    Yeah, with a little help.

      Dave glances at Trevor. Suddenly the room is buzzing.

                                  TREVOR
                    So you know what Dave did? He took 
                    all his money, bought a ticket to 
                    L.A. He s been here six months, out 
                    on the streets, on a quest. So 
                    spread the word, people. You know a 
                    Holly who had a magic moment with a 
                    guy in a music store in Dublin? 
                    He s here. He s looking for her. 
                    Thatgood people, is love.

      ANGLE ON PRUDENCE, wearing a look of amused disbelief.                                                      Thomas_CUPID_031308   22.


                                  CLAIRE
                    I m sorry, that may be romantic, 
                    but it s not love.

                                  TREVOR
                      Hello?Transcendent connection?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Perhaps we can agree to call it 
                    infatuation.

                                  TREVOR
                    We can agree to disagree. What are 
                    you preaching in here? Just don t
                    do it? Reach for the copperring? 

                                  CLAIRE
                    I tell people besmart.

                                  TREVOR
                    Love isn t smart. Love is retarded. 
                    You wanna drink from that trough? 
                    Take it from me and Captain Kirk -- 
                    Bebold.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Love at first sight is a myth. Love 
                    is built on a sturdier foundation, 
                    Trevor -- shared interests, values, 
                    aspirations. Mutual respect, 
                    friendship -- things you can t 
                    possibly establish in a couple 
                    days, let alone twenty minutes.

                                  TREVOR
                    No. Love is heat. Love is passion, 
                    chemistry, sex.

                                  CLAIRE
                    No. Love is what s left after the 
                    heat and passion fades away, and 
                    you can learn that lesson in here, 
                    or you can learn it the hard way.

                                  TREVOR
                    Wow. Who ripped out your heart?

      Claire realizes she put this too bluntly. She takes a deep 
      breath before addressing her suddenly silent group.

                                  CLAIRE
                    This is probably a good place to 
                    take break.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   23.


      Group members stand, begin milling out.

                                  TREVOR
                    An announcement, though. Tres
                    Equis, just down the street, is 
                    offering half-price Margaritas 
                    tonight for singles. It s mariachi 
                    karaoke duets night. I ll be 
                    bartending and pouring  em strong.

    The announcement gets enthusiastic response.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Trevor. Stay.

      Trevor nods, not offended. Claire drums her fingers on the 
      arms of her chair, waits for the crowd to disperse. Then...

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Fifteen years of training has 
                    prepared me to help these people.

                                  TREVOR
                    Oh, and being the Roman God of Love 
                    since the dawn of time has prepared 
                    me for what? Celebrity judge on 
                    Blind Date?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Let s just say for a moment that 
                    you really are Cupid. Remind me 
                    again how you made your matches? 
                    Oh, that s right. You shot them. 
                    Random people falling madly in 
                    love. Look around you, Cupid. 
                    There s an entire economy built 
                    around romantic dissatisfaction. 
                    Your methodology didn t work. How 
                    about you let someone who actually 
                    gives a damn take a shot?

                                  TREVOR
                    But you re nottaking a shot! 
                    You re telling them not to trust 
                    their guts. You re slowing me down, 
                    Toots! Maybe you ve forgotten, but 
                    I wanna go home!

                                  CLAIRE
                    Oh, I haven t forgotten. You ve 
                    been very good about reminding me. 
                    Another thing: I don t want you 
                    feeding Dave s fantasy. He ll end 
                    up getting hurt.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   24.


                                  TREVOR
                    Or, living happily ever after.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I promised the hospital board you 
                    were no danger to yourself or 
                    others. Don t make me regret that.


      RAKING ON A SINGLES GROUP MALE and a SINGLES GROUP FEMALE. 
      They re on the bar s de facto stage performing a karaoke 
      version of Pat Benatar s,  Love is a Battlefield.  They re 
      backed by a five-piece mariachi band in full costume.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL Trevor entering. He finds a very busy Felix 
      behind the bar. Felix looks up, tosses Trevor an apron.

                                  FELIX
                    Margaritas are half price?

      Trevor catches the apron, heads behind the bar, shrugs.

                                  TREVOR
                    It s L.A. They re still six bucks.


    TEN SINGLES GROUP MEMBERS are seated around a large table. We 
      find an urban hipster named JIMMYattempting to chat up 
      Prudence.

                                  JIMMY
                    You can t back out. We re already 
                    signed up. Tell you what: I ll go get 
                    us tequila shots. Liquid courage.

                                  PRUDENCE
                          (worn down)
                    Fine. I ll sing, but do not get me 
                    a shot. I ll take a coffee if 
                    you re getting up.

                                  JIMMY
                    Right back. Don t go anywhere.

      Jimmy approaches Trevor at the bar.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    Tequila shot,  And a porfavor.

                                  JIMMY
                    That s fine. Gotta hit the head 
                    anyway. Coffee s for the lady.

      Jimmy points out Prudence with his eyes.

                                  TREVOR
                    Making that happen, huh?

                                  JIMMY
                    Working on it. She s a tough nut, 
                    though -- a reporter for The Times. 
                    Jaded. You know the type.

      Trevor reacts. A reporter, huh?He slides the tequila shot in 
      front of Jimmy who downs it in a gulp.

                                  TREVOR
                    I ll take the coffee out to her.

      Jimmy nods, heads off toward the bathrooms.

    AT THE GROUP TABLE

      Trevor takes a seat next to Prudence, sets her coffee down.

    ON STAGE

      A PAIR OF SINGLESGROUPERSput the final touches on  You 
      Don t Bring Me Flowers.  The crowd cheers. The singers hand 
    off one of the micsto Lita who checks her clipboard.

                                  LITA
                    Next up. Jimmy and Prudence.

      BACK AT THE GROUP TABLE

      Prudence glances over at Trevor.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    That s my cue. Sorry I can t help 
                    you.

      Prudence stands, makes her way to the stage. Trevor stews, 
      then has an idea. He hops up, heads to the restrooms.

    The men s room and supply closet doors are next to each 
      other. Trevor unspoolsthe power cord to a nearby vacuum. He 
      loops the cord between the two door handles, effectively 
      preventing either door from being opened from the inside.

    ON STAGE

      Prudence is standing self-consciously alone waiting for her 
      singing partner. The music has already started.

                                  PRUDENCE (CONT D)
                    Jimmy? Where are you?


      Jimmy stands at a urinal. The sports page hangs in front of 
    his eyes, and he seems engrossed in a story.


      Trevor finds Dave quaffing pints with a couple guys.

                                  TREVOR
                    Dave. Get up there on stage. 
                      Opportunity is knocking, my friend. 
                    She s a reporter. She can help us 
                    find Holly.

      Dave regards the stage, puts down his pint.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   27.

                          (female part)
                    Baby, you re not that type

      Prudence performs gamely despite the lack of a partner. 
      But...

                                  PRUDENCE (CONT D)
                    Jimmy. Wherever you are. You re a 
                    dead man.


      Jimmy finishes air drying his hands, reaches for the door. 
      He s perturbed when he can t seems to open it. He pulls 
      harder, then begins pounding on it.


      Prudence s had enough. She starts to put the microphone back 
    on the stand. She doesn t see the new performer take the 
      stage, until...

                                  DAVE
                    Don t go breaking my heart

      Prudence turns, discovers Dave on stage with her. She s too 
      taken aback to hit her next line. Dave picks up.

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    Honey, when you knocked on my door--

                                  PRUDENCE
                          (tentative)
                    Oooh, I gave you my key.

    As the song progresses, Dave s performance begins to win over 
      Prudence. His voice is dreamy. His performance is charming -- 
      just the right blend of cheeky karaoke savoir faire and 
      genuine talent. What s more, his confidence is contagious. 
      Prudence  turns it on  a bit.

    AT THE FRONT DOOR

      Claire enters. She spots Trevor standing behind the bar. A 
      voice calls her from the big singles group table.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   28.

      Claire moves to the table and takes a seat. Group members ad-
    lib enthusiastic greetings. Our REDHEADleans closer to 
      Claire, indicates Trevor behind the bar.

                                  OBLIGATORY BRASSY REDHEAD (CONT D)
                    So who s the new guy?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Oh, just a guy I know from work.

                    No. Just a guy.

                    No. He s not.

      Obligatory Brassy Redhead gives Claire a look. 

      ANGLE ON BATHROOM DOORS

      Jimmy forces his way out. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM out to the main 
      floor just in time for Prudence and Dave s big finish. The 
      pair hammilyclasp hands and bow like they re FleetwoodMac. 
    The crowd, with the notable exception of Jimmy, cheers 
        enthusiastically.

    AT THE BAR

      Claire approaches Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                    Couldn t stay away from me.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I wanted to verify employment. I m 
                      responsible for you. Remember?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   29.


                                  TREVOR
                    Likely story. What can I get you? 
                      Sex-on-the-Beach? Screaming Orgasm?

                    futon?

      Claire is at a momentary loss for words. A patron at the 
      other end of the bar waves a bill.

                                  TREVOR (CONT'D)
                    Think about it.

      Trevor wanders down the bar. Claire notices Prudence 
      loitering by the exit. She wanders over to her.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hey. Great job up there. 

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Thanks. My partner carried me.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yeah. He was something. Can you get 
                    over his story? If you were that 
                    Holly, wouldn t you be scared to--

      Dave sidles up to Prudence, hands her a coat. Claire 
      blanches.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Oh, hey. You two are leaving, huh?

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Yeah. We re gonnafind some place 
                    quiet. I think I m going to do a 
                    story about Dave.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (you re shittin me)
                    Wow. Yeah... Good idea.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Yeah, well. Trevor deserves the 
                    credit. It was his suggestion.

      Claire s jaw drops. Prudence and Dave ad-lib goodbyesas 
      Claire turns back to Trevor. He catches her eye, reads her 
      frustration. Off Trevor s  what s up?  shrug.


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   30.


                                      ACT THREE


      Lita exits the TresEquisoffice, descends the staircase. She 
      furrows her brow at the sound of arguing and peers out.

      LITA S POV- Trevor stacks chairs on tables as Claire 
      lectures him. The bar is otherwise deserted.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I told you not to keep feeding 
                    Dave s fantasy.

                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah. That s my point.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (sighs, then...)
                    Look, it s one thing to proclaim 
                    you re Cupid, the god of love. It s 
                    something else entirely when you 
                    insert yourself into strangers  
                    lives, Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah. Thenit s called divine 
                      intervention.

      Lita s absorbs the conversation, heads back up the stairs.


      Lita enters and finds her brother on the phone. He looks up, 
      gives her the  one second  finger. Meanwhile...


      Claire and Trevor continue their discussion as Trevor clears 
      tables by the dart boards.

                                  TREVOR
                    What s the problem? It s not like 
                    I m telling my believers to send me 
                    their social security checks. I m 
                    finding people their soulmates.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   31.

                    Trevor, you don t havebelievers.

                                  TREVOR
                    Is that so? Then why is there a 
                    Temple of Eros down on Melrose?

                                  CLAIRE
                    They sell trashy lingerie.

                                  TREVOR
                    Of course they do! It s one of the 
                      sacraments.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What s next on the agenda for Dave? 
                    Afterthe newspaper interview.

      Trevor finds a dart on a table. He picks up a nearly-full mug 
    of Guinnessfrom the table. He faces away from the dart board. 
    He lines up the dart board in the beer s reflection.

                                  TREVOR
                    Dave claims Holly is a super fox. 
                    Tomorrow I m taking him out where the 
                    beautiful singles mingle. See if we 
                    can t track her down.

      Trevor tosses the dart over his shoulder, hits the bullseye.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    Can you dig it?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Oh, so I suppose Tom Brady is Thor.

                                  TREVOR
                    I could ask around.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (shaking it off)
                    I m going with you tomorrow.

                                  TREVOR
                    Why?

                                  CLAIRE
                    To make sure you re  doing no harm  
                    like I promised the hospital board. 
                    Plus, I want to set up a weekly 
                    session. I ve got Fridays at 3 
                    available.
                          (off Trevor stewing)
                    Or did you want to be recommitted?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   32.


    Off Trevor, not pleased.


      Felix hangs up the phone, regards his impatient sister.

                    You ve gotta fire your tenant.

    Off Felix, curious.


      Dave and Prudence occupy a booth. Prudence takes notes in a 
      REPORTER S PAD.A grizzled waitress warms their coffees.

                    This place is exactly what America 
                    looks like in the movies. The

                    Both real. Each year, after the 
                    harvest came in, single men and 
                    women of Western Ireland would show 
                    up hoping to find a spouse. These 
                    farmers  kids were so spread out, 
                    they might not have met otherwise. 
                    Back in  59, my dad was there. He 
                    spotted my mom standing outside a 
                    dress shop.

                                  DAVE (CONT'D)
                    They were engaged two days later. 
                    I ve never met a happier couple.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    So you re mom must vebeen 
                    supportive as well.

                                  DAVE
                    She was killed when I was 12. Drunk 
                    driver.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I m so sorry.

                                  DAVE
                    Yeah. Me, too.
                          (offeringup his phone)
                    There s a picture of her. She was a 
                    music teacher.

      Prudence takes the phone, regards the picture.

                                  PRUDENCE
                          (touched)
                    She s your screensaver.
                          (then...)
                    Be careful who you show that too. 
                    This is Hollywood. Did you not see 
                    the  you must be...
                          (putting out hand)
                      ...thiscool to enter  sign?

                                  DAVE
                    Then I m in real trouble. First, 
                    I m absurdly uncoolmyself. It s 
                    hard to picture Steve McQueen
                    chasing a girl across the globe, 
                    isn t it? And I ve never wanted to 
                    hang out with cool people, you 
                    know. They re usually a drag.

      Prudence is charmed by Dave s answer.

      ANGLE ON THE DOOR as Trevor enters. He spots Dave and 
      Prudence, beelines toward their table, plops down next to 
      Prudence.

                                  TREVOR
                    So I m mopping up back at the bar 
                    and I get this idea -- what if you 
                    get the newspaper to hire a sketch 
                    artist to do a composite of Dave s 
                    dream gal? Run it with the story.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   34.


                                  PRUDENCE
                    We can do that.
                          (toDave)
                    It s been six months. You think you 
                    can give a description?

                                  DAVE
                      Absolutely.

    Off Prudence, surprised to feel stung by his enthusiasm.


      Felix is sound asleep, until we hear the sound of POUNDING. 
      Felix s eyes snap open. He shakes his head unhappily. The two 
      mixed-breed dogs -- one large, one small -- in bed with him 
      perk up, whine, unhappy about the disturbance as well.


      Felix, wearing a robe, and trailed by the dogs, trudges 
      across the room toward the source of the noise.


      Felix enters. He s nonplused by what he sees. Trevor is 
      standing on a chair nailing up a pool hall counter across one 
      corner of his room.

                                  FELIX
                    You don t plan on opening a pool 
                    hall in here, do you?

                                  TREVOR
                    Nope.

      Trevor steps down from the chair, drags it across the room. 
      Felix isn t quite sure what to do next. He settles on...

                                  FELIX
                    My sister heard you arguing with a 
                    woman after closing last night. The 
                    woman called you Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah, that was my shrink.

                                  FELIX
                          (on eggshells)
                    She said you believe you re Cupid?

                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah, it s a real bone of 
                    contention between us.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   35.


                                  FELIX
                    You told me your name was Ed Ross.

                                  TREVOR
                    No. I said my name was...
                          (drawing it out)
                    ...Eros.
                          (movingon)
                    That s what the Greeks call me. The 
                    Italians say Cupid. Take your pick.

      Trevor begins nailing the other end of the counter up.

                                  FELIX
                    I ll go with Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                    Whatever makes you comfortable.

                                  FELIX
                    Um.I don t have much experience 
                    with mental health patients. Do you 
                    know whether your doctors would 
                    want me to play along as though the 
                    delusion is real or refuse to be 
                    engaged by it.

      Trevor slides all the beads to one end of the counter.

                                  TREVOR
                    Oh, definitely play along. Any 
                    harsher therapy should be doled out 
                    by trained professionals.

      Felix seems relieved. He indicates the pool hall counter.

                                  FELIX
                    So what s all this about?

                                  TREVOR
                    I don t get to go home...
                          (cutting off Felix off)
                    Mount Olympus -- until I match a 
                    hundred couples. This just helps 
                    keep score.

                                  FELIX
                    So...what? You get a point every 
                    time a couple you hook up, you 
                    know, rocks the casbah?

                                  TREVOR
                    I wish. Nope. It only counts if the 
                    gods decide it s...

                    ...true love.

                                  FELIX
                    So how reyou supposed to know when 
                    that happens.

                                  TREVOR
                    I ll know.

      Trevor exits the room. We hold on Felix processing.


      Dave looks over the shoulder of a SKETCH ARTIST.

                                  DAVE
                    Her eyes are more...playful.

    The sketch artist gives Dave a look, begins revising.

      REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS Trevor and Prudence positioned around 
      Prudence s cubicle. The newsroom itself is a hive of 
      activity.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I m starving. Anyone else hungry?

                          (checking watch)
                    Aren t you meeting the photographer 
                    down at the pier in an hour?

      Both Trevor and Prudence deflate.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Damn. Should we all drive down 
                    there together?

                                  TREVOR
                          (still unhappy about this)
                    Can t. I have to meet someone 
                    first. I ll catch up though.

      Dave glances at the slide show playing on Prudence s computer 
      screen, double-takes.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   37.


                                  DAVE
                    Did I just see a picture with you, 
                    Daryl Hall and John Oatesgo by.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    That s right. Got something to say 
                    about it, Sport?

                                  DAVE
                          (shrugs helplessly)
                    Why..?

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Because they re awesome. That s 
                    why. The picture was taken at the 
                    Greek after their sold-outreunion 
                    show. They invited the web-masters 
                    of the top ten fansitesin the 
                    country to hang out backstage.

                                  TREVOR
                    There are tenHall & Oatesfans?

                                  DAVE
                      I certainly feel better about my 
                     property of the borg  boxers.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Get a life, nerd.

      Dave smiles, enjoying the give-and-take.

                                  SKETCH ARTIST
                    Something like this?

    The sketch artist reveals his work to the others.

                          (stunned)
                    That s her. That s the woman I came 
                    here to find.

                                  TREVOR
                    Let s see.

      ANGLE ON THE SKETCH. The woman is breathtaking.

      RAKING TWO SHOT on Trevor and Prudence. They re both 
      momentarily speechless.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    That dlaunch a thousand ships.

    OFF Prudence trying her best not to reveal her disappointment.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   38.



      Dave wanders through the bar scanning the faces of patrons. 
      He s about to give up when he spots a woman in one-quarter 
      profile by the pool. His jaw drops. The woman looks like she 
      could be the one from the sketch. Dave starts moving toward 
      her. Then he does something strange: he stops.

    It appears he s not sure he wants to find out if this is his 
      dream girl. He cocks his head, weighs his options before 
      finally turning back toward camera with renewed 
      determination. He walks toward the look-alike, but before he 
      gets there, she turns fully toward Dave. It s nother. 
      Strangely, Dave appears a mix of relief and disappointment.


      Prudence sits at her keyboard in her cubicle. She s staring 
    at her completed story on screen. She appears torn.

                                  FEATURES EDITOR
                    It s a human interest piece. It s

    The editor exits. We hold on a conflicted Prudence. She 
      turns, stares out the window at downtown Los Angeles. We note 
    the PRUDENTIAL LIFE BUILDINGin the foreground.


      Claire walks down a hallway. She notices the fruit of 
      Trevor s labor -- Isaac and a Marla -- engaged in a private 
      tete-a-tete. Isaac looks unhappy. Claire regards the pair, 
      concerned. She shakes it off, keeps walking. Her phone rings.

                                  CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)
                    This is Claire.


      Digger sits up in his desk, refers to his notes.

                    Dr. Allen. It s Digger. I think 
                    I ve got something for you. An R.T.
                    Hale from the Chicago area was 
                    reported missing a while back. 
                    Never found.

                                  CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)
                    R.T.?

                    Just R.T.Doesn t stand for 
                    anything. I talked to the cop who 
                    worked the case. Hale was a 
                    professor at Northwestern, and the 
                    university was investigating him 
                    for sexual misconduct. Local police 
                    assumed he threw himself off one of 
                    the bridges. They re trying to 
                    track down a photo for me.

                    Thanks, Digger. Let me know. Bye.

      Claire resumes her trek down the hall engrossed in thought.


      Claire sits at her desk holding a compact up to her face. At 
      first, we believe she s checking her reflection, but on 
      closer inspection, we see that she s eyeing a felt dartboard 
    on the wall behind her. She aims, then tosses a Velcro-tipped 
      dart over her shoulder. She fails to hit the board.

    She turns, regards several darts on the floor below the 
      board. She growls. Before she can make another attempt, her 
      iPhonerings. She regards the screen. We see from the 
      picture/text that it s  Dad  calling. It takes Claire some 
      energy to psyche herself up to take the call.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   46.

      Claire listens. A beat later all of her positivity evaporates.

                    Oh, no. Dad. Please do not do that. 
                    It s notthe Alamo.Squatters rights 
                    do not apply in this situation!

    Off Claire s frustration.


      Claire is on the phone dealing with her finances.

                                  CLAIRE
                    No. Just move the money from 
                    savings into checking... I don t 
                    know. I ll think of something.

    As Claire hangs up, Trevor knocks and enters in one motion.

                                  TREVOR
                    GutenTag, herrDoktor.Let s make 
                    this snappy. I ve gotta hundred 
                    things to do before Dave s show 
                    tonight. I ve got balls in the air.

                                  CLAIRE
                            (displeased)
                    It s 4:30.

                                  TREVOR
                          (checking his wrist)
                    Why, yes, it is. Very good. During 
                    our next session, we ll work on 
                    days of the week.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I raced back here, so I could be on 
                    time for our 3 o clock appointment.

                                  TREVOR
                    That s because you rea responsible 
                    adult.

                                  CLAIRE
                    And what s wrong with that? Isn t 
                    that a good thing? Did someone 
                    decide that responsibility was a 
                    quality possessed solely by nerds 
                    and losers?

                                  CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                          (gettingworked up)
                    Why is it that irresponsible people 
                    are always the heroes. They get to 
                    be the dreamers, the visionaries, 
                    the romantics. But if you re 
                      responsibleyou re a killjoy.

                                  TREVOR
                    I didn t make the rules.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I ll let you in on a secret. It s 
                    that responsible  killjoy  who ends 
                    up making the boat payments...who 
                    makes sure the dreamer she loves 
                    takes his medication. It s the 
                      responsible one who ends up with 
                    400 HDDVD players in storage shed 
                    in Van Nuysand five percent share 
                    in a revolving restaurant downtown. 
                    It s the responsible one who has to 
                    say,  No, dad. You did not win the 
                    Canadian Lottery. 
                          (emphatically)
                    Can you dig it?

      Trevor takes a long considerate beat. Then...

                                  TREVOR
                    How much are you asking for those 
                      HD-DVDplayers?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Let s take a walk. I could use the 
                    fresh air. Plus, there s a love 
                    story I want to share with you.

                                  TREVOR
                    I d prefer a courtroom thriller. 
                    I m up to my nards in love.

      Claire simply points toward the door.


      Trevor is gone. Claire opens her laptop. She clicks on a word-
      processing program, opens a title page. She types.

      CLOSE ON SCREEN: IN SEARCH OF CUPID: A CASE STUDY.


    The music cue fades as we find Felix tending to his books. He 
      wears a concerned expression. There s a KNOCK and Lita pokes 
    her head in. Felix looks up.

                                  LITA
                    You should come look at this.


      Felix descends the stairs, turns a corner, his eyes go wide.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   51.


    THE BAR IS PACKED. It s wall-to-wall humanity. We catch a 
      glimpse of Dave on stage tuning his guitar. Felix is 
      thunderstruck. Trevor calls out to him from behind the bar.

                                  TREVOR
                    Yo! Boss! Little help?

      Felix turns to Lita. They share a smile. They needed this 
      kind of night badly.


    The packed house applauds as Dave wraps up a version of the 
      Turtles   Happy Together. 

      Dave glances out into the crowd, smiles. CAMERA FINDS the 
      person he smiled at -- Prudence. She s seated next to Claire 
    at a small table enjoying the show. Claire observes the 
      smitten way Prudence watches Dave s performance. She smiles.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (knowingly)
                    You look awfully nice.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Am I being stupid? He s in love 
                    with someone else.

      Claire gives a supportive smile.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You re being proactive. That s 
                    chapter one of my book.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    A few days ago I felt sorry for the 
                    girl on the Hollywood sign. Now I m 
                    jealous of her.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Don t be. He s only in love with 
                    the ideaof someone else.

                                  DAVE
                    I learned a new song especially for 
                    this night. It goes out to someone 
                    who is spectacularly uncool.And 
                    that s what I dig about her.

      Dave starts playing guitar. Prudence shakes it off, turns her 
      attention back to Dave who is performing the Hall & Oates
      standard,  You Make My Dreams Come True.                                                      Thomas_CUPID_031308   52.


                                  DAVE (SINGING) (CONT D)
                    What I ve got s full stock of 
                    thoughts and dreams that scatter. 
                    You pull them together. And how, I 
                    can t explain. You make my dreams 
                    come true. Hoohoo.Hoohoo.

      Prudence is smiling wide. Most of the patrons of the bar have 
      started singing along, so we don t immediately notice when 
      Dave stops playing. Prudence notices, though. We re on 
      Prudence as she realizes what s happened.

      PRUDENCE SPOV- Dave has stopped playing. He looks like he s 
      seen a ghost. And there she is - the DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS WOMAN
    who inspired him to come to America. She s made it to a table 
      just a few feet from the stage and Dave has spotted her.

      ANGLE ON TREVOR AT THE BAR as he realizes what s happening.

      ANGLE ON CLAIRE as she sees it, too.

    The audience -- now without any accompaniment -- begins 
      cluing in. They ve all read the story. Someone starts 
      applauding. Others join in. Dave steps down from the stage. 
    The mystery woman stands. The two come together.

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    Holly. I knew I d find you.

      Dave embraces the mystery woman. Trevor is thrilled. He 
      glances over, notices Prudence walking sadly toward the door. 
      Trevor moves to catch her.

                                  TREVOR
                    Prudence. Don t go. This is it. 
                    You ve got your story.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I didn t want to be the girl who 
                    got the story this time, Trevor. I 
                    wanted to be the girl who got the 
                    song.
                          (holdingup thumb and 
                            forefinger)
                    I came thisclose.

      Prudence takes one look back at Dave hugging his mystery 
      woman. She forces a wan smile and exits.


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   53.


                                        ACT FIVE


      CLOSE ON TREVOR s CONCERNED FACE. We hold on this tight shot 
    as his eyes scan from side to side. He grunts unhappily.

                                  TREVOR
                    Huh.

      REVEAL TREVOR s POV.The pool bead counter. All the beads are 
      still lined up on one end.


      Trevor enters the diner, spots Dave and Holly in a booth. He 
      approaches the table. Dave sees him and lights up.

                                  DAVE
                    Trevor this is Holly. Holly, this 
                    is a friend of mine, Trevor. He s 
                    the person responsible for twisting 
                    the fabric of space and time and 
                    bringing us back together.

      Holly is beautiful, friendly enough, supremely self-
      confident, and ever-so-slightly hipper-than-thou.

                                  HOLLY
                    A regular Cupid, huh?

      Trevor shakes Holly s hand and sits down next to her.

                                  TREVOR
                    No such thing.

        A WAITRESSapproaches, sets down cappuccinos. Holly sips hers 
    as the waitress serves Dave.

                                  HOLLY
                    Uh. I asked for non-fat.

                                  WAITRESS
                    It is, honey. I made it myself.

      Holly grimaces in an I-hate-to-be-a-pain way.

                                    HOLLY
                    Maybe the container was mis-labeled.

    The waitress glances at Dave who says nothing. She picks up 
      Holly s cup, heads away from the table. Holly addresses Dave.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   54.


                                  HOLLY (CONT D)
                    I have so much to teach you. This 
                    place used to be theafter-hours hot 
                    spot -- it had this whole Reservoir 
                    Dogsvibe, you know, like real
                    people came here -- but then 
                    everyone sort of remembered,  what s 
                    so great about real people? 

                                  DAVE
                    I don t know...I m kind of a fan of 
                    real people.

                                  HOLLY
                    Oh, yeah, we all are. That didn t 
                    come out right. I grew up around 
                      salt-of-the-earth folk -- god love 
                     em -- but I came to L.A. forthe 
                    bright lights. If you moved to 
                    Paris in the  30s, you d wanna hang 
                    out with Cole Porter, Henry Miller, 
                    right? Not Jean QPublique.

      Trevor regards Dave. He can tell from the look in Dave s eye 
      that this relationship is never going to work.


      Lita watches over his shoulder as Felix stands at the cash 
      register counting the take from the previous night. They re 
      both euphoric. Lita is the first to notice Trevor entering. 
    She squeals, her attitude toward him muchimproved. 

                                  LITA
                    Trevor!

                                  TREVOR
                    Lita, ustedes tan hermosoque me 
                    duele.

                                  LITA
                    Oh, Trevor.

                                  FELIX
                    Trevor. My man!

                                  TREVOR
                    I need to ask you guys a favor...or 
                    two.

                        FELIX*LITA*
    You picked the right time to  name it...**You
      ask. Anything...*                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   55.


    Off Trevor s nod.The plan is in motion.


      Claire stands in the back of the room in which Trevor s 
      release was approved. Another psychiatrist addresses the same 
      trio of doctors we ve seen before. Claire glances up 
      momentarily and something catches her attention. Engraved in 
    the marble above the doctors is an epitaph...

    THE WORLD FELT A TREMOR
    AND DOWN CAME THE HAIL

      CLOSE ON THE FINAL TWO WORDS -- TREMOR, HAIL. Claire shakes 
    her head, allows a smirk. Her cell phone rings. She answers.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hello?


      Trevor is on the pay phone.

                                  TREVOR
                    Hey. It s your favorite patient.

                                  CLAIRE
                      TremorHale?

                                  TREVOR
                          (shaking it off)
                    Uh... Yeah. Listen, I ve been up 
                    all night brainstorming. As much as 
                    I hate to ask, I need you. What do 
                    you say? Help me OB-1-Claire-nobi.
                    You re our only hope.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What dyou have in mind?


      Prudence returns to her cubicle wearing a dour expression. 
      She s surprised to see Trevor waiting there for her.

                                  TREVOR
                    Baklava. You and me. I did some 
                      investigating. I know where we can 
                    find the best baklava in the great 
                    state of California. You with me?

      Prudence isn t in the mood, but it requires less energy to go 
      along with the plan than to resist. She picks up her purse.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   56.


                                  PRUDENCE
                    What the hell. I m done here.


      Trevor and Prudence ride in the elevator with others.

                                  TREVOR
                    ...some heretics will try to 
                    convince you syrup is an authentic 
                    topping. Humbug. Me? Give me honey.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I appreciate what you re trying to 
                    do. It s really sweet of you to 
                    check in on me, but I m not sure 
                    I m going to be very good company.

                                  TREVOR
                    That s okay. I ll be great company.

      Prudence manages a grateful smile.


      Trevor and Prudence sit across from each other in candlelight  
      browsing their respective menus. The view of the downtown 
      skyscrapers surrounding them is breathtaking. 

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I don t even see baklava on the 
                    menu.

                                  TREVOR
                    I think you must have to special 
                    order it.

      Prudence looks out the window, cocks her head.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Are we moving?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   57.


                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah, it s one of those restaurants 
                    that spins.

      Prudence glances down, sees the seem in the floor. The outer 
      ring of tables is revolving around an inner ring.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Huh... I didn t know these even 
                    existed anymore--

      Prudence stops talking abruptly as she hears the sound of an 
      acoustic guitar being strummed. She turns her head in the 
      direction of the sound.

      Trevor and Prudence s table is essentially moving toward the 
      restaurant bar. There on a small stage is Dave backed by the 
      TresEquishouse band. Dave is already looking Prudence in 
    the eye as he begins singing the first line of the song.

                                  DAVE (SINGING)
                    I ve been so many places in my life 
                    and time. I ve sung a lot of songs. 
                    I ve made some bad rhymes. I ve 
                    acted out my love on stages with 
                    ten thousand people watching, but 
                    we re alone now, and I m singing 
                    this song for you.

      ANGLE ON PRUDENCE. Her jaw has dropped. She s unsure how to 
      respond. Trevor reaches over and taps her on the hand. 
      Prudence regards Trevor who points out the window.

        PRUDENCE SPOV.The restaurant has rotated enough that the 
      PRUDENTIAL LIFE BUILDING has come into view. The sign on the 
    top no longer reads  PRUDENTIAL LIFE,  however.

    The sign now reads  PRUDENCE 4 LIFE. 

      TIGHT ON PRUDENCEas she tries vainly to choke back tears, 
    and yet she seems frozen in her seat as Dave begins to spin 
    by. She looks at Trevor imploringly.

                                  TREVOR
                    Ask yourself...what would Captain 
                    Kirk do?

      Prudence grins, then bolts out of her seat and rushes toward 
      Dave. Dave rips off his guitar. The two embrace and begin 
      kissing to the surprise of the restaurant s patrons. Though 
    the singing has stopped, the mariachi band continues to play. 
    The violin takes over the melody line.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   58.


      CAMERA FINDS CLAIRE sitting at the bar. She also finds herself 
      a bit misty-eyed. She glances over, sees Trevor savoring the 
      moment. She regards him for a moment. He turns and catches her 
      eye. Off Trevor and Claire sharing a satisfied look.


      Dave and Prudence kiss. They unbutton and unfasten each 
      other s clothing. They make the cat collar hanging from the 
      bedpost jingle. The images are sweet, romantic, sexy. 

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    Certainly there was no magic bow 
                    and arrow, but Trevor created a 
                    romantic scenario that witnesses 
                    would almost universally first 
                    think to describe as  magical. 

      Prudence and Dave roll off the bed in hysterics.


      Claire walks around her office speaking into a headset.

                    My casebooksare full of stories 
                    about soldiers who have seen so 
                    much blood and suffering on the 
                      battlefield that the only way they 
                    can cope is to convince themselves 
                    they re Jesus Christ -- the prince 
                    of peace.

      ANGLE ON HER LAPTOP as voice recognition software types in 
      everything Claire dictates.

                    In many cases, the delusion 
                    actually protects these patients

                    The key to dispelling the delusion, 
                    I believe, is to learn the cause

                    Of course to learn the cause, I

      Claire reaches into her desk drawer, pulls out the plastic 
    bag containing Trevor s effects.

                    ...pink feather, a tube of cherry 
                    chapstick, a novelty stripper pen 
                    and a trio of party balloons...

      Claire looks more closely at the balloons. Something catches 
    her eye. She holds a balloon up to her eye, then, surprises 
    us by blowing into it. She ties it off, regards the balloon.

      TIGHT ON THE HEART-SHAPED BALLOON:  Fete Accompli Party 
      Supplies -- Olympia, WA. 

      Claire stares at the balloon, intrigued. She dials her cell.

                    Hey, Mr. Lenardi... Yes, Digger. 
                    You can forget about RTHale in 
                    Chicago. I ve got a new lead. Can 
                    you find out if the man in the 
                    photo I gave you went missing from 
                    Olympia, Washington?

    Off Claire, a bit more hopeful than before.


      Dave passes through the lobby, but he s stopped by two men in 
      suits before he gets very far.

                                  MAN IN SUIT

    Off Dave, crestfallen.

                                        ACT SIX


      Trevor enters in a cheery mood. He moves behind the bar, puts 
    on an apron. Felix appears, and Trevor looks up.

                                  TREVOR
                    Hey, boss. What s the good word?

                                  FELIX
                    That singer, Dave, called hoping 
                    you were around. I guess the INS 
                    caught up to him. They put him on a 
                    plane back to Dublin...
                          (checking watch)
                    Dave wanted me to tell you thanks 
                    for everything...say goodbye.

      Trevor looks like he s been hit with a sledgehammer.

                                  FELIX (CONT D)
                    You should really get a cell phone.


      Trevor enters, approaches his pool hall counter. All the 
      beads remain grouped on one side. Off Trevor, demoralized.


      Claire stands at the door ad-libbing greetings to the singles 
      arriving at the session. She spots Prudence coming up the 
      stairs, clearly upset. Claire approaches her, pulls her aside.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Prudence. What s wrong, honey?

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I ve got a question to ask you, and 
                    I already know your answer, and 
                    it s not your decision to make, but 
                    I want a sober voice in my head...

                                  CLAIRE
                    You lost me.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    The INS took Dave away. Back to 
                    Ireland. And I think I may be in 
                    love with him. But I know that s 
                      impossible. I ve known him two 
                    days. People don t fall in love in 
                    two days, do they?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   61.


      Claire regards Prudence sympathetically, but the resignation 
    in Claire s expression indicates her she won t be giving 
      Prudence the answer she was hoping for.

                                  TREVOR (PRELAP)
                    For thousands of years I just shot 
                    people. Sat back. Laughed at the 
                    results.


    PAN OFF an unwrapped cell phone box, find Trevor using it.

                                  TREVOR
                    It was a game. An easy game. I 
                    preferthe easy game. Why do 
                    mortals make falling in love so 
                    difficult?


    We find Claire in a downtown loft, modern design. She stares 
    out at the lights of the city, a glass of wine in hand.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You ll get used to it, Trevor. In 
                    fact, I find my moments of playing 
                    god much more taxing.

                                  TREVOR
                    What?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Nothing. I just... I just gave some 
                    advice tonight, and I m not sure it 
                    was good advice.
                          (shakingit off)
                    No. I m sure it was good advice, 
                    it s just no fun always being the 
                    one telling people to slow down.
                          (then...)
                    I m thinking about disbanding the 
                    group. I ve been using them for 
                    research. Maybe it s not fair.

                                  TREVOR
                    No. You can t. They need you. I
                    look around that singles group of 
                    yours and think,  buddy, get a dog. 
                    Order the complete cable package. 
                    I m in there looking to make the 
                    easiest match. But not you. You 
                    show up at those sessions thinking 
                    you can save them all.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   62.

                                  TREVOR
                    You say that with your authoritative 
                    tone, and even though I know better, 
                    I almost believe you.

                    Someone broke your heart -- I m 
                    sure of that much. But you ll heal. 
                    You ll even fall in love again.

                    Here? With a mortal? Not likely.

                      Homesickness.

      Claire smiles. As she does, we INTERCUT...


      Claire and Trevor sit at an outdoor table engaged in 
      conversation. From this distance the two look more like 
      friends or people on a date than a doctor and her patient. We 
      leave them feeling as though their relationship evolved into 
      something new.


    We find the source of the music. It s Dave. He s sitting at a 
      piano in a mostly-deserted pub attempting to figure out the 
      chords to a Hall & Oatessong. He begins to sing.

                                  DAVE (SINGING)
                    She s gone. Oh I, oh I d better 
                    learn how to face it. She s gone. 
                    Oh I, oh I d pay the devil to--

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey.

      Dave looks up. He s overwhelmed to find Prudence standing 
      over him. If Prudence had any doubt about whether Dave would 
    be glad to see her, it s gone in an instant.

      Dave knocks over the piano bench in his anxiousness to take 
      Prudence in his arms. As the two fall into a mind-bending
