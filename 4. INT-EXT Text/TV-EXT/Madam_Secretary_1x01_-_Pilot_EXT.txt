teachers with fixity of purpose, messenger bag over her 
shoulder, checking her watch.  45, striking in every way, 
full of passion for everything she does, including getting to 
her destination.  A male student, JAKE, approaches.

Jake is just staring at her.

ELIZABETH (CONT D)
Oh, I thought we were telling each 
other our problems.  No extension.

Elizabeth walks off leaving Jake to ponder.

She smiles.  Anton peels off.



Elizabeth comes out of the building with her SECURITY DETAIL. 
She looks completely different.  Head to toe makeover 
including a sassy hair cut.  She looked good before.  She 
looks amazing now.  As she begins to walk down the D.C. 
street, people start to recognize her.  Some call out.  
Everyone stops to take her picture.  A young female TOURIST 
steps forward to say hello.  Security stops her.  

ELIZABETH

TOURIST

ELIZABETH
Of course.  How about the whole

A YOUNG HUSBAND and SMALL CHILD join them.  They pose and a 
DIPLOMATIC SECURITY AGENT takes the photo.  The tourists 
thank her and she walks on with her detail.  Cameras are 
coming out of the woodwork.  Just as she planned.



Elizabeth comes out with the King and poses once more for 
press photos.  They shake hands and part.  She heads down the 
hallway with her staff following close behind.

DAISY
That moment is already trending, 
Madam Secretary.  Twitter is 
blowing up.  People love it.62.


ELIZABETH
Not everyone s going to love it so, 
Matt, prepare a statement for 
tomorrow.  We might have to call a 
press conference.

MATT
Already working on it.

NADINE
Do you want it to become an issue 
or do you want it to go away?

ELIZABETH
 Let it become an issue.  We ve
spent enough time on my hair.

DAISY
World health, education, War on 
Women, how do you want to frame it?

ELIZABETH
All of the above.
