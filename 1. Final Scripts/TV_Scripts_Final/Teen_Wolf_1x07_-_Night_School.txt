                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT11

      The school doors slam shut, shaking on their hinges as Scott 
      and Stiles grip the handlebars with everything they ve got.

                                  SCOTT
                    Lock it, lock it!

                                  STILES
                    Do I look like I have a key?

                                  SCOTT
                    Grab something--

                                  STILES
                    What?

                                  SCOTT
                    Anything.

      While Scott clutches the handlebars, Stiles looks out the 
      doors to the BOLT CUTTERS leaning against the wall outside.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    No.

                                  STILES
                    Yes.

                                  SCOTT
                    No, Stiles, don t--

      But he pushes past Scott, stepping out into the cold air.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT22

      Holding still, Stiles glances into the darkness. All he sees 
      is the breath pluming from his lips. Then feet moving, he 
      races to the side of the building where the bolt cutters lie. 
      Grabbing them, he turns back to see--

      Scott staring out the glass doors. Trying to speak. Trying to 
      say--          TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/112.

                                  SCOTT
                    Run.

      Stiles slowly turns his head as SOMETHING lopes out of the 
      darkness, a swiftly moving POV coming right for him.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT33

      Stiles charges back in with the bolt cutters. Scott grabs the 
      other handle, the two of them fumbling to get both sides of 
      the tool down into the bars, a makeshift lock.

      When they look up again the WALKWAY leading to the doors lies 
      empty. A few leaves tumble across the pavement.

      They slowly retreat back, taking each step faster and faster 
      until--

      They re running.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - NIGHT44

      Scott and Stiles hurtle into a dark classroom.

                                  STILES
                    The desk--the desk.

      They slip around the teacher s desk and start pushing it 
      toward the door only to flinch at the LOUD SQUEAL of metal 
      against tile.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Stop, stop!

      Holding still, they speak fast.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                            (whispering)
                    The door s not going to keep it 
                    out.

                                  SCOTT
                    I know--

                                  STILES
                    It s your boss.

                                  SCOTT
                    What?

                                  STILES
                    Deaton. The Alpha. Your boss.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/113.

                                  SCOTT
                    No--

                                  STILES
                    Yes. Murdering, psycho werewolf.

                                  SCOTT
                    It can t be.

                                  STILES
                    He disappears and that thing shows 
                    up ten seconds later to toss Derek 
                    twenty feet through the air. That s 
                    not convenient timing?

                                  SCOTT
                    It s not him.

                                  STILES
                    He killed Derek.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek s not dead. He can t be dead.

                                  STILES
                    Blood spurted out of his mouth. 
                    That doesn t exactly qualify as a 
                    minor injury. He s dead. We re 
                    next.

                                  SCOTT
                      Okay--just--what do we do?

                                  STILES
                    We get to my Jeep. We get out of 
                    here. You seriously think about 
                    quitting your job. Good?

      Scott nods. They turn to the windows to view the parking lot. 
      Quietly stepping to the furthest window, they spot Stiles s 
      Jeep sitting in the lot about twenty yards away.

      Scott puts his hands on the window sill.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/114.

                    They don t open. The school s 
                    climate controlled.

                                  SCOTT
                    Then we break it.

                                  STILES
                    Which will make a lot of noise.

                                  SCOTT
                    So then we run really fast.

      They glance back to the Jeep. Now seeming much further away.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Really fast.

      While Stiles starts looking for something to break one of the 
      windows, Scott comes closer to the glass.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Stiles, what s wrong with the hood 
                    of your Jeep?

                                  STILES
                    What do you mean? Nothing s wrong.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s bent.

                                  STILES
                    You mean dented?

                                  SCOTT
                    I mean bent.

      Stiles cups his eyes to the window. Oddly, the Jeep s hood 
      twists up toward the windshield like the top of a tin can.

                                  STILES
                    What the hell happened to my--

      AN EXPLOSION OF GLASS by their heads sends them SCREAMING to 
      the floor. Ducked under the window, they look past raised 
      arms to see--

      SOMETHING skidding across the tile and slamming to a stop on 
      the opposite side of the room amid a shower of BROKEN GLASS.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/115.

      It s the JEEP S BATTERY, wires hanging off it.

                                                                            CUT TO:
      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - NIGHT55

      Scott and Stiles sit frozen underneath the classroom window, 
      staring at the Jeep s battery in front of them. 

                                  STILES
                    That s my battery.

      Scott nods. Both of them gazing at it, stunned. Stiles starts 
      to get up but Scott grabs him.

                                  SCOTT
                            (whispering)
                    Don t.

                                  STILES
                    We have to move.

                                  SCOTT
                    He could be right outside.

                                  STILES
                    He is right outside.

      Scott keeps him down, hand gripping his friend s shoulder.

                                  SCOTT
                    Just let me take a look.

      Craning his neck to see out the window, Scott glances around 
      the empty and dark school lot.

                                  STILES
                    Anything?

      Scott shakes his head.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Move now?

                          (nodding)

      They get up, scrambling across the tile floor.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/116.


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT66

      The classroom door cracks open. Scott and Stiles slip into 
      the hall. They glance down the opposite ends of the corridor, 
      nervously drifting forward.

                                  SCOTT
                    This way.

                                  STILES
                    No, no--somewhere without windows.

                                  SCOTT
                    Every single room in this building 
                    has windows.

                                  STILES
                    Somewhere with less windows.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT77

      The door opens, Scott and Stiles hurrying inside.

                    Call your Dad.

                    And tell him what?

                                  SCOTT
                    Anything. There s a gas leak, a

                    There s nothing near the school for

      Still gripping Stiles s arm, Scott listens, nervous breath 
      rising. Stiles moves to take his hand off the doorknob, but 
      Scott clenches down on his arm, a signal to stop.

      A SHADOW passes by the mottled glass window of the door. Mere 
      centimeters from them.

      Scott eases off Stiles s arm, slowly stepping back.

                          (barely audible)
                    Hide.

      Stiles draws back into the darkness with him. They both 
      glance around in terrified desperation. 

      There is nowhere to hide. 

      Stiles looks to Scott with pleading eyes. But Scott doesn t 
      seem to know what to do either. So Stiles reaches for a 
      locker door. And climbs right in.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    No, Stiles--Stiles.

      But then a second later, Scott slips into the locker across 
      from Stiles to hide as well.

      INSIDE THE LOCKER - Scott holds still, trying to control his 
      breathing, trying to quiet his heartbeat.

      THE LOCKER ROOM DOOR OPENS.

      A large, dark figure enters. AN ODD CLICKING SOUND on the 
      concrete floor.

      THROUGH THE LOCKER S AIR VENTS - Scott watches the SHAPE pass 
      by him. He can see Stiles through his own vent holes, eyes 
      wide and terrified.

      INSIDE THE OTHER LOCKER - Stiles puts his hand over his mouth 
      trying to cover his breathing while--

      Scott holds utterly still, just his eyes blinking rapidly in 
      the darkness as--

      The locker door yanks open, revealing--          TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/119.

      THE JANITOR. He SCREAMS in surprise, staggering back. Before 
      Scott can get a word out to explain, Stiles stumbles out of 
      the opposite locker.

                                    JANITOR
                    Son of a bitch!

      Scott grabs him, trying to keep the terrified man on his 
      feet.

                                  SCOTT
                      Quiet--quiet!

                                    JANITOR
                    Quiet, my ass. Are you two trying 
                    to kill me?

      Gasping, the Janitor leans against the locker looking like 
      he s on the verge of a heart attack.

                                    JANITOR (CONT D)
                    Both of you. Get out.

                                  STILES
                    Just listen for half a second, 
                    okay?

      The door slams open into the hallway, Scott and Stiles pushed 
      out by the furious Janitor.

                    Just one second to explain--

                    Shut up and go.

      Then, hand still on the door, the Janitor suddenly WHIPS BACK 
      into the locker room, SWINGING the door SHUT with him.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1110.

      The movement happens so quickly it leaves Scott and Stiles 
      staring in utter confusion at the closed door. Until--

      THE JANITOR S FACE COMES SLAMMING BACK TO THE DOOR S WINDOW. 

      Scott and Stiles stagger away in shock as the body of the 
      Janitor slams forward again, rattling the door in its frame.

      Scott grabs at the door, trying to get it open, trying to 
      help the man as Stiles pulls him back.

      Both of them SCREAMING, Scott and Stiles finally run for it, 
      racing down the corridor as--

      THE LOCKER ROOM DOOR wrenches off its hinges, BURSTING into 
      the corridor and falling to the floor. The Janitor s dead 
      body collapses down onto the door and then in one swift 
      motion--

      Is dragged back into the darkness of the locker room.

      EXT. ARGENT HOME - NIGHT99

      Down the sidewalk from her home, Allison looks from one end 
      of the street to the next, still waiting for Scott. Her phone 
      RINGS and she puts it to her ear.

                    Too late.

      Jackson pulls up in his Porsch  with Lydia. He rolls down the 
      window. Strangely, his face has lost the paleness, a 
      healthier glow returning to his cheeks.

                                    JACKSON
                    Lydia gets what Lydia wants.

      Allison finally gives a reluctant sigh. But the moment she 
      opens the door to get in the back, her phone BUZZES.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1112.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT1010

      Feet flying across the floor, Scott and Stiles race for the 
      exit at the end of the hall. They reach the fire door handles 
      at the same time, pushing down and shoving forward.

      The doors OPEN, but only an inch, CLANGING against something 
      behind them. Pushing again, they hear the same METALLIC 
      CLANG. Something is on the other side, blocking the doors.

                                  STILES
                    What the hell?

      Scott peers out the open inch of the door.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s a dumpster. A garbage 
                    dumpster.

      The two slowly retreat a few steps.

                                  STILES
                    He pushed it in front of the doors--

                    --to trap us in.

      Stiles turns, backing into the door, trying to push off from 
      his feet and move the dumpster behind it.

                                  STILES
                    Help me.

      The door CLANGS against the dumpster again and again as he 
      keeps trying to muscle it open.

                    into teamwork. That s beautiful.

      They retreat from the doors again, looking down the other end 
      of the hall. But their cautious progression comes to a halt 
      when Scott pauses. He turns to the wall of windows at the 
      side of the corridor looking out on the courtyard and 
      opposite side of the school.

      ON THE ROOF - A figure crouches in the darkness, RED EYES 
      gazing directly at them.

      Scott and Stiles start moving, running, nearly stumbling over 
      each other as--        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1114.

      crashing back into the school.

      Scott grabs Stiles, pulling him to the adjacent stairwell.

      They race into the lower level of the school, running for 
      safety while--

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT1111

      Jackson s Porsch  swerves into the lot. He gets out of the 
      driver s side, pulling the seat up to let Allison out. They 
      both glance at the Jeep parked a few spaces away.

      upright against it, carefully placed there to hold it open. 
      Almost as if welcoming Allison into the school.

      Scott and Stiles back into the basement of the school, 
      slipping around corners. Florescent lights flicker above them 
      with an ELECTRIC CRACKLING.

      Stiles glances at the doors with mesh cage windows in them, 
      old and dirty lockers lying open inside. Trying to think 
      fast, eyes darting as--

      A DOOR SLAMS OPEN behind them.

      The two of them pull back into the darkness. Holding still, 
      they hear a STRANGE CLICKING on the floor, claws tapping 
      against the tile.

      Stiles s eyes move from the thin corridor to where several 
      old ADMINISTRATIVE DESKS lie stacked against the wall. Scott 
      catches his look, seeing an idea come to fruition.

      Stiles slowly--very slowly--moves his hand into his coat 
      pocket to pull out his CAR KEYS. He brings them up. They 
      JANGLE softly, causing both boys to flinch.

      Scott glares at Stiles, eyes nearly coming out of his head. 
      Especially when his friend rears back and--

      THROWS THE KEYS.

      They land right in one of the cage rooms, CLATTERING AGAINST 
      THE WALL.

      Something BLURS past, A MASSIVE SHAPE in the darkness, 
      soaring in after the keys.

      Without hesitating, Stiles jumps out of the shadows and slams

      With barely a second to comprehend the plan, Scott rushes to 
      one of the steel desks and rams it against the closed door. 
      Stiles slips out of the way as the door JERKS FORWARD hitting 
      the side of the desk.

      The Alpha ROARS from inside the cage room, SLAMMING into the 
      door. But the desk wedges between it and the opposite wall.

      Scott and Stiles turn to each other in a moment of pure 
      triumph. The Alpha can t get out.

      He steps out, Lydia clicking her own door open.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT1414

      Jackson runs his fingers over the crumpled hood with Lydia by 
      his side.

                                  LYDIA
                    Look at that. It is indeed a piece 
                    of crap. Can we get Allison and 
                    leave now?

      Ignoring her, he leans closer, noting the strange grooves in 
      the hood. Like claw marks. He then glances to the doors of 
      the school. And starts toward them.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    What are you doing? Are we getting

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/BASEMENT EQUIPMENT ROOM - NIGHT1515

      Stiles and Scott stand on opposite sides of the desk now 
      wedged between the cage door and the wall. Stiles slowly 
      motions with his hand for Scott to climb over. But Scott 
      looks too scared to move.

      A BREATH comes from inside the cage room. 

      Both boys turn back. They can t see it in the darkness, but 
      the Alpha is there, trapped inside.

      With a far more emphatic look, Stiles twists his head at 
      Scott, trying to get him to climb over the desk to him.

      Finally, Scott moves, awkwardly sliding over the desk as--

      THE ALPHA S HAND SLAMS UP against the mesh wire window of the 
      door sending both Stiles and Scott flinching back. They stare 
      at the massive hand, clawed fingers like talons fitting 
      through the openings. It slowly pulls back, disappearing 
      again into the shadows.

      Incredibly, Stiles starts toward the cage room.

                                  SCOTT

                                  STILES
                    It s trapped. It can t get out.

      The cage RATTLES as if in response.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                          (more confident now)
                    That s right. We got you.

                                  SCOTT
                    Shut up.

                                  STILES
                    No. I m not scared of this thing.
                          (to the Alpha)
                    I m not scared of you. Because 
                    you re not going any--

      Suddenly the Alpha LEAPS UP, SHOOTING RIGHT INTO THE CEILING. 
      THE PANELS BURST away, CRASHING and CLATTERING to the floor.  

      Scott and Stiles gaze up in horror as the ceiling panels 
      above them SHAKE, bending and popping up under the weight of 
      the creature. No longer trapped at all.

      They turn to watch the panels rumble and shake above as the 
      Alpha makes its retreat.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT1616

      Heels clicking down the hallway, Allison peeks into one 
      classroom after another.

      Her voice echoes down the corridor. Shadows bounce across the 
      walls as she moves toward a stairwell.

      She heads for the door of the GIRLS ROOM.

                                    JACKSON
                    Are you kidding? You have to use

                    all your functions.

      Ignoring his comment, she pushes through the door. Arms 
      folded, Jackson gazes back to the empty corridor. But his 
      arms fall to his sides when he sees something...

      A LARGE SILHOUETTED FIGURE. At the end of the corridor. 
      Standing there. Watching him.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    McCall?

      He steps forward, trying to catch any detail of the figure at 
      the end of the hall. But it s an almost perfect silhouette. 
      And still strangely motionless.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Scott?

      Then, almost as an inaudible whisper, he says another name...

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Derek?

      The silhouette moves from a standing position down to all 
      fours. Then, almost casually, it lopes into the next hallway, 
        disappearing around the corner.

      Short gasps choke their way between Jackson s lips as he 
      stares down the long corridor until--

      THE GIRL S ROOM DOOR slams open, sending him nearly off his 
      feet.

      it out to answer.

      In-between the walkways of the high school s swimming pools, 
      Allison puts her phone to her ear.

      She clicks off and is about to put her phone away when it 
      rings again, startling her. She gives a curious look at the 
      display and then answers.

      Lydia pauses. The others watch her expression change to one

                    Derek want to kill us? Why s he 
                    killing anyone?

      They all look to Scott for the answer.

      He snaps at her, causing Allison to flinch noticeably. Behind 
      her, Jackson can t help but smile just a little bit. Stiles 
      gets in between them to pull Scott aside.

                                  STILES
                    What? Like it wants to eat us all

                                  SCOTT
                    No. Derek said it wants revenge.

                    That s it. Give me your phone.

      He spins Stiles around, grabbing for the phone in his pocket. 
      But in a moment of pure instinct, Stiles reels back and 
      CLOCKS Jackson, sending him sprawling to the floor.

      Strangely, Lydia isn t the one running to help him up. It s 
      Allison.

                                    ALLISON
                    Are you okay? Jackson?

      While he s turned around, she can t see the look on his face. 
      And despite being punched, he s smiling, silently pleased by 
      the turn of events. He slowly gazes back, feigning shock and 
      hurt.

      Seeing Allison covering her territory, Lydia seems to snap *
      back to life and hurries over to help. *

      Cradling his shaking hand, Stiles looks to Scott who is just 
      as surprised. Then, with the hand not trembling in pain, 
      Stiles reaches into his pocket and fishes out his cell phone. 
      As the others watch, he dials.

      WHAM! A stack of chairs tumble down as the barricade against 
      the doors begins to fall. Stiles lowers the phone, backing 
      away with the others.

      Something HAMMERS at the doors. SMASHING at them, POUNDING, 
      desperately trying to BREAK THROUGH.

      THE VENDING MACHINE SLIDES FORWARD. A chair whips past

      Stiles grabs at him, trying to get him to pull back. But 
      Scott cocks his head, listening...

      He hears the CLICK of CLAWS against the tile floor. The 
      creature coming closer and closer. The door RATTLES from the 
      weight of its approach.

      Lydia covers her mouth with her hands, trying not to shriek 
      as a BREATH STEAMS THE WINDOW at the door. And then...

      It moves on, the sound of its lumbering body dissipating. 
      After a moment, the kids breathe. But no one moves. Eyes

      She has tears in her eyes, out of fear and anger.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Remember how you told me that you d

                    You re a terrible liar. And you ve 
                    been lying all night.

      The others listen behind her, watching with evident 
      discomfort as Scott almost responds with another lie but then 
      keeps his mouth shut.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)

      Furthest from the group, Jackson practically has to bite his

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/STAIRWELL - NIGHT2626

      The door to the darkened stairwell eases open. All too aware 
      of his own frightened gasps, Scott steps inside and peers 
      down...

      No sign of movement. He begins taking the steps one-by-one, 
      inching his way back to the first floor.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT2727

      Scott steps around the corner, breathing the air in, cocking 
      his head... and catching a scent.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT2828

      TWO DOUBLE DOORS quietly click open allowing Scott to step 
      into the school s cavernous gymnasium. A large wide-open 
      space, it s lit only by the emergency lights mounted over the 
      two exits. 

      Clutching the MOLOTOV COCKTAIL in his hand, Scott takes a 
      breath of the air, his head turning toward THE TELESCOPING 
      BLEACHERS against the wall.

      He makes his way over. But instead of climbing up, he steps 
      around and UNDERNEATH the bleachers.

      Through the dark recesses Scott ventures deeper and deeper. 
      Feeling his way through the underside of the bleachers, he 
      slowly peers up to discover something hanging in the shadows 
      above.

      THE JANITOR S KEYS.

      Hanging from his body which itself hangs from the metal 
      supports crosshatching the underside of the bleachers...

      Stiles, Lydia, Jackson and Allison sit, lined up against the 
      wall while waiting for Scott s return.

                    It s going to be okay.

      Stiles turns, hearing the whispers. He glances to Lydia who 
      seems strangely calm. Almost like she s determined not to be 
      frightened anymore while Jackson leans closer to Allison.

                                    ALLISON
                    I can t stop shaking.

                    It s okay.

      He puts his hands over hers, their fingers intertwining, 
      trying to keep her calm while his eyes linger over her just a 
      little too long.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT3030

      Scott gently sets the MOLOTOV COCKTAIL down on the floor. He 
      reaches for one of the metal supports underneath the 
      bleachers. Stepping gingerly up, he begins climbing, making 
      his way toward the KEYS which hang from the Janitor s belt. 

      After one last step, he stretches his arm, trying to grasp at 
      the keys when--

      A CLUNKING SOUND makes him stop.

      He holds still, eyes darting to the shadows. Then cocks his 
      head to listen. But there s nothing. He reaches up again for 
      the keys when--        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1138.

      CONTINUED:3030

      ANOTHER CLUNK causes the supports to shudder. Turning back, 
      he sees what the source of the sound is when--

      THE BLEACHERS START COLLAPSING INWARD.

      Someone or SOMETHING is pushing the seats in from the gym 
      floor, causing the bleachers to telescope in on him.

      With a well-aimed swipe, Scott snatches the keys off the 
      body. He jumps back to the floor between the bleachers and 
      the wall and hurtles for the light just beyond.

      But the bleachers close in fast, threatening to crush in on 
      him as he makes one last leap. He grabs the MOLOTOV COCKTAIL 
      on the floor and--

      Tumbles out to safety.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CHEMISTRY CLASSROOM - NIGHT30A30A

      At the teacher s desk, Lydia glances at the bottles of 
      chemicals they used to make the Molotov Cocktail.

                    I gave you exactly what you asked 
                    for. Didn t I?

      He stares at her, unblinking. An unnerving, frightening 
      stare. Lydia looks back at the bottle.

                                  LYDIA
                    Yeah. Yeah, I m sure you did.

      Standing at the edge of the collapsed bleachers, Scott 
      shakily raises the Molotov Cocktail.

                    Come on. Come and get me.

      and squeezes his eyes shut waiting for the fiery explosion.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1138A.

      But all he hears is breaking glass. He snaps his eyes open to 
      see harmless chemicals spilling across the floor.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Oh damn.

      SOMETHING latches around his ankle and drops him right to the 
      floor. The KEYS tumble out of his grasp as he s hurled to the 
      center of the gym. 

      A CLAWED HAND clamps down on the side of Scott's head, 
      pushing his face to the floor. The tips of the claws poke 
      into his cheek, threatening to draw blood as his eyes open 
      wide.

      Then the ALPHA S SILHOUETTED PROFILE eases down toward 
      Scott s face, sharp teeth jutting from its open mouth. It 
      lets loose a ROAR as powerful and earth-shaking as the cry of 
      a T-Rex. 

      Pinned and helpless, Scott s eyes suddenly blaze with a 
      YELLOW GLOW as if in response to the Alpha s roar. He opens 
      his mouth, teeth now fanged.

      He s beginning to shift...

      The others turn to hear the echoes of the bizarre sound 
      coming from the school below. All except for Jackson who--

      Falls to his knees, wincing in pain. Then he s SCREAMING. 
      Hand clutching the back of his neck, he crumbles to the floor 
      as the others whirl around to see him lurching in pain.

      Scott twists up, the Alpha no longer holding him down, no

      But brought on this time by the howl of the Alpha, the shift 
      is agonizing, his body wracked with spasms of pain, clawed 
      hands pressing, almost digging into the floor.

      His head whips up as the transformation completes. But 
      something is different. Teeth bared, an animalistic pulling 
      back of his lips, it s as if innocent Scott McCall has 
      disappeared completely. Nowhere to be found behind the yellow 
      eyes now searching the shadows for something...

      hand comes up. His breath is ragged, almost strangled by low 
      growls rising from the back of his throat.

      Stiles turns to Scott.

                                  STILES
                    We survived, dude. We outlasted the 
                    Alpha. That s still good, right? 
                    Being alive?

      Scott shakes his head, sitting down on the school steps.

                                  SCOTT
                    We were in the Chemistry room and 
                    it walked right by us. You don t 
                    think it heard us? You don t think 
                    it knew exactly where we were?

                                  STILES
                    Then why are we still alive?

                                  SCOTT
                    Because it wants me in its pack. 
                    But I think first I have to get rid 
                    of my old pack.

                                  STILES
                    What? What old pack?

                                  STILES
                          (starting to understand)
                    The Alpha doesn t want to kill 
                    us...

                                  SCOTT
                    He wants me to do it.

      And for once, Stiles doesn t know how to respond.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    That s not the worst part.

                                  STILES
                    How the holy hell is that not the 
                    worst part?

                                  SCOTT
                    Because when he made me shift... I 
                    wanted to do it. I wanted to kill 
                    you. All of you.

      As the words sink in on Stiles, Scott glances past him. A 
      look of shock comes to his face. Stiles follows Scott past 
      OFFICERS and CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS to an ambulance where 
      someone is being checked out by an EMT.

      Deaton looks up.

                                  DEATON
                    There you are.

                                  SCOTT
                    How.. How did you...

                                  DEATON
                    Get out? Not easily. And from what 
                    they ve been telling me, I m alive 
                    because of you. 
                          (with a warm smile)
                    I think I owe you a raise.

      Stilinski approaches, gently pressing Scott back.

                                  STILINSKI
                    We ll let you talk to him later. 
                    Give the EMT s a chance to check 
                    him out.

      Scott steps back with Stiles, both still looking on Deaton. 
      But his attention is grabbed by someone else hurrying between 
      police cars.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1142aA.

                                  SCOTT
                    Allison?

      She glances back to see him hurrying toward her.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Are you okay?

                                    ALLISON
                          (nodding)
                    My dad s on his way.

                                  SCOTT
                    Do you need me to do anything? Want 
                    me to come back with you--

                                    ALLISON
                    No, I don t.

      The words come quickly.

                    Okay...        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1142A.

                    I don t feel like I trust you. 

                                  SCOTT
                    I can explain.

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t care--

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay. Don t say anything else. 
                    Please. Just don t say anything 
                    yet.

                                    ALLISON
                    Don t.

      Scott opens his mouth to speak, but the response won t come. 
      Just a short, agonized breath. Almost like a gasp of pain in 
        anticipation of the words he knows are coming...

      the flashing red and blue police lights.
