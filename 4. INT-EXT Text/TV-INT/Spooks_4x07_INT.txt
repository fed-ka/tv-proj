      Title: Foreign Ministry, Damascus, Syria

      Foreign Minister RIYAD BARZALI: 50s, greying, glasses, very 
      old world, probably sports a mustache -- is at the door of 
      his office, bidding farewell to BRITISH AMBASSADOR WRIGHT.

      The Minister s personal assistant -- in effect his 
        intelligence services (the  Mukhabarat ) MINDER, ALI (30s, 
      dark hair, in a slick suit) is, as always, by his side. This 
      is a place where every word, every wink, is monitored KGB 
      style, particularly when it comes to interacting with 
      foreigners, and even more so when it involves members of the 
      government.

      Barzali ushers the Ambassador to the door --

                                    BARZALI
                    It s a shame you won t be with us 
                    in London for the celebrations. I m 
                    told the center is an incredibly 
                    beautiful building. 

      -- subtly positioning himself between the Ambassador and Ali.

                                  AMBASSADOR WRIGHT
                    I m afraid our foreign office is a 
                    bit of a miser when it comes to 
                    travel allowances. Still, I ll make 
                    sure I see it on my next trip home.

                                    BARZALI
                      Inshallah.

      The Ambassador extends his arm to shake hands. Barzali cups 
      the man s hand in both of his. Ali is behind him now, and 
      can t see his face.

      Barzali looks the Ambassador in the eye. The affable, casual 
      smile is replaced by a more serious look, the hands firmly 
      cupped.

                                    BARZALI (cont d)
                    I look forward to meeting your 
                      colleagues while I m there. There s 
                    so much to discuss. 

      -- and as Ali is back in their sightline, Barzali s 
      expression goes back to one of a smiling host, still holding 
      the Ambassador s hand firmly.

                                  AMBASSADOR WRIGHT
                          (thrown, but hiding it)
                    Have a safe trip.

      He turns to the minder. A mutual smile and a handshake.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   2.

      The Ambassador leaves, unnerved.


      Adam watches as Fiona gets dressed for a formal event. Adam s 
      visibly concerned about something, and Fiona s avoiding him.

                                  ADAM
                    I still think it s a bad idea.  

                                  FIONA
                    It s not everyday that the foreign 
                    minister of Syria says he wants to 
                    have a quiet chat.

                                  ADAM
                    We re not even sure that s the 
                    case.

                                  FIONA
                    The foreign office seem to think 
                    so.

                                  ADAM
                    There are a hundred other ways we 
                    could have done this. None of which 
                    would have required your presence.

                                  FIONA
                    I know these people. 

                                  ADAM
                    I was there too, remember?

                                  FIONA
                    I think I know them a bit more 
                      intimately.

      It s not something Adam likes to be reminded of.

                                  ADAM
                    That s my point.

                    Adam, we ve been over the guest 
                    list ten times. There isn t a 
                    single name on it I recognize. No 
                    one there s going to know me. And 
                    even if they did, so what? My ex-
                    husband turned out to be an Israeli 
                    spy, not me. I left the country a 
                    disgraced widow. No one s going to 
                    bear me a grudge.

                    As long as they still buy that 
                    little fairy tale.

                                  FIONA
                    It s been hanging over us long 
                    enough, don t you think?

      He just stares at her, frustrated. Something s wrong. He 
      moves closer, takes hold of her shoulders, turning her to 
      face him.

                                  ADAM
                    What is it? Come on. Talk to me. 
                    You ve been acting strange for 
                    weeks.

      She finds it difficult to look him in the eye. She musters up 
      a smile -- but it s not an entirely convincing one.

                                  FIONA
                    I can t hide forever, can I?

                    You re not hiding, sweetie.

                    Of course I am. Even here, in the 
                    privacy of my own bedroom, I feel 
                    like I m undercover. It s like, 
                      sometimes, I wake up in the morning 
                    and I m not sure who I am anymore.

                    At least you remember it.

      He looks at her for a beat. Not getting it.

                    What s gotten into you?

                    I m just tired of living a lie.

      She gently pulls away and goes into the bathroom.


      Fiona stares at herself in the mirror.

      FIONA s POV: She s looking at her face. Haunted. Scared.

      And we SMASH CUT to her remembering...


      Fiona s in the women s department, checking out some clothes. 
      OTHER WOMEN shoppers are around.

      ANGLE ON A WOMAN, young, Fiona s age -- dark haired, olive 
      skinned, middle eastern, well dressed -- who does a double 
      take as she spots her from behind some rails, maybe thirty 
      feet away. It s like she recognizes her.

      She watches Fiona for a beat, trying to see if it really is 
      who she thinks it is, and looks around furtively before 
      moving closer hesitantly and with visible unease.

                                  WOMAN
                    Amal...? Amal?

      The name chills Fiona to the bones. She glances at the 
      approaching woman and turns, slipping away, heart racing.

      The woman follows her, not in a desperate chase, but wanting 
      to talk to her --

                                  WOMAN (cont d)
                    Amal!

      She rounds a corner -- only:

      WOMAN S POV: Fiona s gone. Disappeared among the crowd.

      Disappointed, the woman turns and walks away.

      Watched from behind a display by a nervous Fiona. And we 
      SMASH CUT to --


      Fiona, staring at herself in the mirror. Pulse racing.

      Her face hardens with resolve. She needs to be strong. She 
      blocks the memory and takes a deep breath.


      A major gala underway: crystal chandeliers, string quartet in 
      the corner, champagne flutes. ARABS in robes and head-dress 
      mingle with other DIGNITARIES in black tie and long 
      dresses...

      In the crowd, we FIND ZAF, working the room as a waiter, 
      smiling as he navigates, a tray of canapes in hand.

                                  ADAM (O.S.)
                    Do you have a visual on Fiona yet?

      CLOSE ON THE SCREEN: ZAF S HIDDEN CAM POV, navigating through 
      the crowd, its mike also PICKING UP a noisy cacophony of 
      AUDIO CHATTER from everyone in the vicinity -- 

      We re with Adam, MALCOLM, and COLIN, in the van, watching 
      several CCTV screens. Colin s fiddling with the audio 
      controls, ISOLATING CONVERSATIONS and filtering them as Zaf 
      moves around.

      Adam turns to SCREEN 2. It shows another angle of the party. 

                                  ADAM
                    Jo?

      The IMAGE and SOUNDS on the screen match --


      -- the POV from the hidden camera in JO S BROOCH as she walks 
      through the crowd, in disguise, looking very different. 

                                  JO
                    I ve got her. Three o clock. She s 
                    about to make contact.


      Adam tenses up, watching the screen --

                                  ADAM
                    Okay, everybody. Eyes and ears on 
                    Fiona. Anyone even flinches like 
                    they ve recognized her, I want to 
                    know about it.


      FIONA -- understatedly elegant, not eye-popping, so as not to 
      attract undue attention -- shakes hands with Foreign Minister 
      Barzali. The omnipresent minder is with him.

                                  FIONA

                    I m sure we can arrange something.

      ANGLE ON JO 

      Scanning the crowd, studying faces -- 

      AND NEAR JO, very close to her -- she doesn t notice him even 
      though he s within mike range from her -- A MAN with a 
      cigarette has taken a serious interest in Fiona. We ll come 
      to know him as BASHEER SHALHOOB, 45. 

      HIS POV: Fiona, chitchatting with the Foreign Minister.

      He reaches for his mobile and dials a number. The ringing 
      TONE is not a UK one. His eyes burn into Fiona.

                    Ba ath party upon his return to 
                    Syria. Mid-level party member until 
                    he s appointed foreign minister two 
                    years ago.
                          (beat, to Adam)
                    He s a Sunni Muslim.

                                  JO
                    Why is his religion relevant?

                                  ADAM
                    Syria is ruled by a minority, the 
                    Alawites -- probably the least 
                    religious branch of Islam. Even 
                    though they only make up around ten 
                    percent of the population, they 
                    control all the positions of power 
                    in the country, big and small. 
                    We re talking every military 
                    officer, every tank commander, 
                    every helicopter pilot, and of 
                    course, all the top seats of 
                      government -- they re all Alawites, 
                    except for the foreign minister, 
                    which has traditionally been a 
                    token cabinet position they hand 
                    out to the country s huge Sunni 
                    majority.

                                  ZAF
                    In other words, Barzali isn t  part 
                    of the family .

                                  RUTH
                    He s a follower -- he toes the 
                    party line, does what he s told and 
                    keeps his head down in return for a 
                      prestigious position and a 
                      comfortable life.

                                  ZAF
                    So we re saying the man s not one 
                    to ruffle feathers.

                                  ADAM
                    Until now.

      A beat. 

                                  JO
                    So why all the cloak and dagger 
                    routine? Can t he just set up a 
                    meeting and tell us what s on his 
                    mind? He s got diplomatic status.

                    Syria, like any self-respecting 
                    Ba athist dictatorship, has a 
                    notorious intelligence service, the

                    Barzali practically can t brush his

                                  RUTH

      He looks to Fiona for confirmation -- she nods.

                                  FIONA
                    I d say he wants to talk.

                    I ve already established contact.

                    I hardly think you and me waltzing 
                    in there together would be the

                    presence, take the focus off you.

      Jo looks at Fiona. Not Fiona s ideal scenario, but...

                                  FIONA
                    Fine.


      Fiona, Jo and Ruth. Ruth s handing Jo some printouts, a crash

      Shalhoob -- the man who was watching Fiona at the big bash -- 
      is at his desk. He studies some pictures.

      CLOSE ON THE PICTURES: they re shots of Fiona, at the party. 

      He settles on one of them: 

      CLOSE ON THE SHOT: she s talking to Barzali.

      He stares at it, thinking. His phone BEEPS. He answers.

                                  SHALHOOB
                          (in Arabic, with subtitles)
                    I m looking at them right now... 


      MALCOLM hands Fiona a small aluminium BRIEFCASE from a table. 

                                    MALCOLM
                          (re: briefcase, curious)
                    You don t usually go for the heavy 
                      artillery. You sure you remember 
                    how to use one of these?

                                  FIONA
                          (dismisses it lightly)
                    It s just to keep Adam happy. 
                          (re: briefcase)
                    You know, this might be a bit 
                    too... cumbersome. You think I 
                    could also have something more 
                    discrete?

      He thinks about it. Reaches into one of his big drawers and 
      pulls out a key ring, which he hands her. Fiona examines it.

      CLOSE ON THE KEYRING: it s got what looks like a black 
      plastic car alarm BLEEPER on it. Only there are two small 
      holes on its side.

                                    MALCOLM
                    It s got cupro-nickel hollow point 
                    bullets for maximum effect --

                                  FIONA
                    -- but it s not the most accurate 
                    gun on the planet. I know.

                                    MALCOLM
                    At least it won t trip the 
                    embassy s metal detectors.

                    Serbian mafia would be if they knew 
                    we were using their little 
                      inventions?

                                    MALCOLM
                    Theirs tend to go off 
                      unintentionally. 

                                  FIONA
                    And ours don t, right?

      Malcolm just gives her an enigmatic smile.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Anything else I can interest you 
                    in?

                                  FIONA
                          (playful)
                    I could use one of those trackers, 
                    if it isn t too much trouble.

      Malcolm smiles and reaches for something else: a small 
      microchip wafer, the size of a flattened vitamin tablet.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Turn around.

      She does, and lifts her hair off her neck. 

      Malcolm takes places the flat chip on a piece of skin-
      coloured tape and tapes it at the base of her hairline. It s 
      unnoticeable.

      He turns to his computer and hits some keys. She joins him.

      CLOSE ON THE SCREEN: A map of London, and a cursor showing 
      Fiona s position BLINKING. It ZOOMS IN to show she s at 
      Thames House.

                    He invented GPS. 
                          (beat, a bit concerned now)
                    You know you can always swallow it 
                    if it s compromised. It ll still

      She smiles and leaves. 

      OFF FIONA -- nervous.


      Fiona s finishing stuffing some clothes into a bag and zips 
      it shut. Adam hovers, still unhappy with the situation.

                                  ADAM
                    You don t need to stay there. We ll 
                    make sure they only see what we 
                    want them to see. 

                                  FIONA
                    I don t want to take any chances. 
                    My legend needs to be fully 
                      backstopped. 

      She picks up the bag, gives Adam a kiss as he hands her the 
      aluminium case --

                                  FIONA (cont d)
                    Besides, it s good to spend a few 
                    nights apart. Makes it all the more 
                    fun when we re back together.

      Adam looks at her. He s not swayed.

                                  FIONA (cont d)
                    Tell Wes I ll call him from there?
                          (sees he s still miffed)
                    It ll be over before you know it.


      Fiona s alone. Fidgety. Flicking through TV channels. Staring 
      through the screen. She FLICKS it off, walks over to the 
      window.

      She rubs her finger against the back of her neck, her eyes 
      catching her reflection in the glass. And we SMASH CUT to --


      Fiona, peeping out from behind her cover, watching as the 
      woman who recognized her stands there, looking lost. 

      The woman turns and walks away, disappointed.

      ON FIONA -- she can t bring herself to do this. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   15.

      She emerges from her cover and follows the woman, puts her 
      hand on her shoulder as she reaches her.

                                  FIONA
                    Joumana?

      The woman -- JOUMANA -- turns. Her face lights up when she 
      sees Fiona. It s like the meeting of two long lost sisters. 
      Joumana hugs Fiona, tight. Fiona s as moved as she is.

      They pull back -- and Fiona sees sadness and fear breaking 
      out across Joumana s face. Tears streak down her cheeks. 
      Fiona doesn t understand.

                                  FIONA (cont d)
                          (Arabic, in subtitles)
                    Joumana? What s wrong?

      Joumana shakes her head like she doesn t want to talk about 
      it. Fiona presses her.

                                  FIONA (cont d)
                          (Arabic, in subtitles)
                    What s happened?

      And as Joumana turns, Fiona recoils as she spots a nasty old 
      SCAR just below her friend s hairline. Joumana looks at 
      Fiona. Whatever it is, it s an extremely painful memory -- 
      Joumana starts to cry -- 

                                    JOUMANA
                    After you left...  They came for 
                    us...

      -- and we SMASH CUT back to PRESENT DAY and --


      Fiona snaps the image out of her mind, heart racing. She 
      calms herself, finds the briefcase Malcolm gave her and opens 
      it. 

      CLOSE ON THE BRIEFCASE: it s got a big, silver 9mm automatic, 
      silencer, bullets. The works.

      She pulls out the gun, pops in a magazine, chambers a round. 
      And looks at it. 


      ...where Fiona and Jo are finishing up a meeting with 
      Barzali, with Ali in attendance as always.

                                    BARZALI
                    We need to move away from this 
                      ridiculous  axis of evil  label the 
                    Americans seem obsessed with.

                                  FIONA
                    Despite the fact that you signed up 
                    for Desert Storm --

                                    BARZALI
                    -- at great political risk, I might 
                    add. Our people weren t happy to 
                    see Syrian troops fighting side by 
                    side with Marines and killing other 
                    Arabs. 

                                  JO
                    What s happening in Lebanon isn t 
                    helping either.

                                  FIONA
                    We ll flesh out some ideas and put 
                    together a pitch document for you. 
                    Give us...
                          (looks at Jo)
                    ...three days?

      Jo nods.

                                    BARZALI
                      Excellent.

      They reach the door. As they shake hands --

                                  FIONA
                    We d love to take you out for a 
                    nice meal while you re in town. 
                    Lunch perhaps? Tomorrow?

      Barzali turns to Ali, who shrugs like it s doable.

                                    BARZALI
                    It would be a pleasure.

      They re about to leave when Shalhoob appears. He seems 
      surprised to see them. Fiona almost imperceptibly flinches in 
      a moment of recognition. 


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   17.

                    She might be doing some PR work for

                          (to Fiona)
                    Mr Shalhoob is also here for the 
                    opening.

                                  FIONA
                    Setting up a cultural center was a 
                    great idea. We can build on that.

                                  SHALHOOB
                    Most people don t know anything 
                    about Syria. Have you ever been 
                    there?

                                  FIONA
                    Not yet.

                                  SHALHOOB
                          (to Barzali)
                    You should arrange for Miss

                    It s a beautiful country. 

                                  FIONA
                    I m sure you re right, but I m way 
                    too busy to even think of going 
                    anywhere in the foreseeable future.
                          (to Barzali)
                    Thank you.

      She turns to Jo, motioning that it s time to go.


      Fiona and Jo get into the car. Fiona s visibly shaken. She 
      reaches for the car keys, but her hand s shaking and it takes 
      a beat for her to get it in. She pauses, shuts her eyes for a 
      beat, controls her breathing -- which Jo s watching.

                                  JO
                    Are you okay?

      Fiona doesn t answer, lost in her own thoughts.

                                  JO (cont d)
                    Let me drive.

                                  FIONA
                    No, I m fine.

      Jo looks at her. She s anything but.                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   18.




      Fiona, ten to twelve years ago. Major difference: long hair. 
      Laughing, carefree -- oblivious to the problems of the world.

      She s with her cigar smoking, champagne popping husband-to-be 
      FAROOK SUKKARIEH: around 40, tall, tanned, thick black hair, 
      not bad looking despite the big mustache, and radiating power 
      and ruthlessness. Having a ball.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   19.

      They re at a table with friends. Farook is in full swing, 
        entertaining them with some story, Fiona (next to him) and 
      the others hanging on his every word before erupting in 
      laughter. He turns to her, gets the waiter to refill her 
      glass -- attentive. Smiles at her. She s bewitched.

                                  FIONA (O.S.)
                    I got completely caught up in his 
                    aura. He had charm, he had power.


      A big group getting drunk at a table. Only Fiona s cast 
      aside, watching as Farook toasts and laughs away, fawning 
      attractive local WOMEN to each side --

      She looks across the table in silent frustration, finding a 
      sympathetic eye in another woman: Joumana, the woman who 
      recognized Fiona in the department store.


      By their front door, a suited Farook jabs a stern finger and 
      mouths fierce words to a tearful Fiona before abandoning her 
      and SLAMMING the door --


      Farook is all over another WOMAN -- watched from the shadows 
      by a scared Fiona.


      Ten years ago. Fiona, looking frail and drained, drifts 
      through some stalls. A man s eye catches hers: Adam s. 

                                  FIONA (O.S.)
                    He was really sweet.


      -- and behind some stalls, where Adam grabs her and they kiss 
      passionately.

                                  FIONA (O.S.)
                    We fell in love...


      Adam, getting savagely beaten up by THREE SYRIAN HENCHMEN and 
      FAROOK as another of his men holds back Fiona. 

      Adam collapses, seemingly dead, and Farook turns to Fiona and 
      gives her a massive, open handed slap, sending her down.

      They get into a car and drive off. 

      Fiona crawls over to Adam s inert body, tears streaming down 
      her bloodied face. She turns him over. He looks dead.

                                  FIONA
                    I m sorry. I m so sorry...


      Adam, heavily bandaged and bruised, sits with an MI6 FORGER 
      who s working on some photos. Adam s studying several black 
      and white photos:

      CLOSE ON THE PHOTOS: one shows Farook talking to a Syrian 
      man. Others show an Israeli officer in various poses, some 
      with an Israeli flag clearly visible nearby.

      The forger finishes his work, hands Adam the picture. Adam 
      checks his work:



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   22.

      CLOSE ON THE PHOTOS: the new one s just like the original of 
      Farook talking to the Syrian, only his face has been replaced 
      with the Israeli s face. 

      Adam nods his approval.

                                  FIONA (O.S.)
                    He framed him. 


      Ruth, at her desk. Studying her screen.

      CLOSE ON THE SCREEN: she s working her way through a list of 
      Syrian arrivals, flicking through screen shots of their 
      passports.

      Adam peers over her shoulder.

                                  ADAM
                    You re checking Syrian arrivals?

                    She didn t mention it.

      Ruth can see Adam s uncomfortable with the situation.

                    She could still be recognized.

                                  RUTH
                    Farook was hanged. Fiona had 
                    nothing to stay for. Even if 
                    someone were to recognize her... 
                    they ve got nothing against her.

                    In which case they d be after you, 
                    not her. You were the one who 
                    framed him. Besides, as far as 
                    they re concerned, you did them a 
                    favour. He did turn out to be a

                    pissed off at you, it s the

      It s late. Jo s still at her desk. Pulling up old files on 
      her computer.

      ON SCREEN: A newspaper article headlined  SYRIA EXECUTES 
      ISRAELI SPY . It s got a picture of a man dangling lifelessly 
      from a noose at a public hanging (archive photos of this

                    It s romantic, in a weirdly

                    didn t snap his neck. He choked to

                    she married some Neanderthal.

                    At least she got out of there.

                    It s hard on her, you know. Going

      An elegant place. Fiona, Jo, Barzali and Ali are seated 
      together as a WAITER finishes pouring the wine. 

                                  FIONA
                    I wasn t sure if we should order 
                    any wine.

                                    BARZALI
                    Please, Miss Stratstone. We re not 
                    mullahs. And we re not hypocrites 
                    like the Saudis either, claiming to 
                    be the great defenders of Islam and 
                    opening fundamentalist madrassahs 
                    for their people while getting 
                    drunk the minute they re behind 
                    closed doors. In Syria, we live 
                    very much like you do here in 
                    London -- free to wear what we want 
                    and drink what we like. Which is 
                    not the way the wind is blowing in 
                    the region. Look at our newly 
                    liberated neighbours. 
                          (beat, smiles)
                    We re an endangered species. And 
                    without a strong government in 
                    Damascus, you could see burkas on

                                  FIONA
                    We need to remind people about 
                    that.

      Fiona eyes Ali discretely, watching him as he studies the 
      waiter carefully. The waiter leaves. Fiona raises her glass.

      Jo raises her glass. Barzali is about to go for his glass -- 
      but Ali reaches for it courteously and takes it instead.

      Barzali notices the girls spotting this, and smiles 
        reassuringly as he reaches for the glass that was meant for 
      Ali.

                                    BARZALI
                    It s just an old habit. Protocol.

                                  FIONA
                          (a beat, then laughs)
                    I thought it was a custom I wasn t

      They CLINK glasses, we ZOOM UP to a tiny camera hole in the 
      wall and SMASH CUT to -- 


      -- and a CCTV view of the table on a screen.

      Watching are Adam and Colin. 

                                  ADAM
                          (into mike, annoyed)
                    We ve got ourselves a taster. 
                    Malcolm, you getting this?


      Malcolm is in the kitchen, listening through his earmike, 
      watching another screen alongside the CHEF and the WAITER.

                                    MALCOLM
                    They ve ordered the same starters 
                    and main course as each other. They 
                    could be swapping them around all 
                      afternoon. 


      Adam, reacting --

                                  ADAM
                    Go to plan B.

                                                                      JUMP CUT TO:                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   28.




      Later now. The WAITER finishes serving the main courses. 
      Barzali and Ali have identical dishes of lamb. 

                                  FIONA
                    Make sure you leave plenty of room 
                    for their puddings. They re to die 
                    for.

      Fiona watches, waiting to see if they switch plates -- but 
      Ali doesn t go for it, keeping his own.

                                  FIONA (CONT'D)
                    Bon appetit.


      Adam, watching the screen.

                                  ADAM
                    Okay. Let s wait for them to dig 
                    in.

      ON SCREEN -- they pick up their forks and take their first 
      bites. Barzali included.

                                  ADAM (CONT'D)
                    Go. Now.


      The waiter arrives at the table, a sauce boat on a tray.

                                  FIONA
                    Ah, the mint sauce.
                          (to Ali)
                    You must try some. 

      Ali glances at the waiter -- and as he does, Barzali looks at 
      Fiona who gives him the most discrete of nods. Ali nods to 
      the waiter to go ahead. 

      The waiter serves Ali some sauce, then moves over to Barzali. 
      Barzali nods too. The waiter leans over --

      CLOSE ON THE SAUCE BOAT: as he stirs the sauce, he uses the 
      spoon to SQUEEZE OPEN a small sack hidden inside the boat, 
      releasing a liquid into the sauce.

      He serves Barzali. Smiles, and retreats.

      Fiona watches, waiting --


      -- as does Adam --

                    Let s see him switch plates now.

      ON SCREEN: Barzali doesn t really give Ali an option. He just 
      digs in.

                                  ADAM (cont d)

                    repeat, we are go.


      The end of the meal now. They re all savouring their coffees.

                                    BARZALI
                    ...and I thought, well, since I 
                    wasn t going to...

      Barzali loses his train of thought. He looks ill and seems 
      dazed and sweaty. He loosens his tie. 

                                    BARZALI (cont d)
                    I m sorry, I don t know what...

      Ali looks at him. He looks terrible. 

                                  FIONA
                    Are you alright?

      Just then, Barzali SEIZES UP, grabbing his stomach in pain, 
      and falls off his chair. Ali jumps out of his chair as Fiona 
      and Jo get up to help --

                                  JO
                    Oh my God. What s wrong with him?

      Ali s all over him already, checking his breathing, loosening 
      his collar -- but Barzali s shaking, bile oozing out of his 
      mouth before passing out --

                                  FIONA
                    Someone call an ambulance.

      Jo pulls out her mobile --

                    No, it s okay, I ll call the

                                  FIONA
                    Look at him. He needs help NOW.

      Ali looks from Fiona to Barzali, not sure what to do --                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   30.




      The Kuwaiti underling from the jet, Kareem -- but not in his 
      white robe anymore -- sits next to an Arab DRIVER. He motions 
      for him to go. 

      They pull out following the taxi, right past --


      Zaf and another AGENT watch as the Arabs follow Fiona s taxi. 

      Zaf uses a camera with a long lens to take shots of them.

      Dusk. Barzali s in bed. He s out, asleep, an IV drips going

      Ali stands with ADAM -- who s in doctor garb.

                    We ll take good care of him.

                    I ll wait here.

                    Suit yourself. 


      Zaf, parked nearby, watching them.

                                  ZAF
                    Adam. They re pulling out. They re 
                    going after her.


      Fiona, listening to Zaf s ranting through her earpiece.

                                  ZAF (O.S.)
                    You re going to pay for that, mate. 
                    I ll calling the cops.

      Only she doesn t smile. She looks at her hands, clasping the 
      small keyfob gun that Malcolm gave her. 

      She s shaking.


      Ruth is at her desk, studying the video footage of the party. 

      ON SCREEN: it s the roaming POV of the surveillance cameras 
      on Zaf, Jo and others.

      She stretches out, knotty after several hours of this. Takes 
      a sip of her coffee. And resumes.


      Fiona, screening the passport captures of Syrians going 
      through immigration on her laptop (or PDA). 

      She studies each one carefully before clicking to the next.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   34.

      On the table next to her is the gun.


      Ruth, still working her way through the videos. Tired.

      She spots something and sits up:

      ON SCREEN: a camera angle crossing in front of Jo, only as it 
      does, the camera turns to capture Jo for a beat. A moment of 
      recognition between two agents on an assignment.

      Only Ruth s seen something else. She looks closer.

      ON SCREEN: To Jo s side is SHALHOOB. From the angle, we can 
      tell that he s looking at Fiona, who s off to one side of the 
      screen.

      He then picks up his mobile and calls, his eyes still on 
      Fiona (this is the scene we saw him do in the Teaser, but 
      from another angle). But before he can speak, the camera 
      moves off frustratingly and roams again.

      Ruth freezes the image and rewinds it, intrigued.


      Ali sits on the uncomfortable waiting chairs outside 
      Barzali s room, tired, bored. There s a scattering of boring, 
      out of date magazines, and a coin operated coffee machine. 
      It s all captured on CCTV by --


      Adam, Colin and Malcolm, watching him ON SCREEN.

                                  COLIN
                    Maybe we should pipe in some 
                    Richard Clayderman tapes.

                    Rob. You re on.

      They watch as --


      An OLD MAN (Rob) in dressing gown and slippers, wheeling an 
      IV drip, walks over and sits next to Ali.

      He doesn t look at him. He just starts to COUGH. A really 
      disgusting, wheezing, contagious sounding cough.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   35.

      Ali, annoyed, gets up and walks away --


      Adam, Colin, Malcolm -- watching it on screen.

                                  COLIN
                    Nice.

                    Let s hope Barzali doesn t really 
                    catch something in there.

                                  COLIN
                      I wouldn t bet on it.

      They see Ali take a few steps, leaning against the wall.

                                  ADAM
                    Cue Jenny.

      They watch as the NURSE from earlier (Jenny), appears, smiles 
      at him as she passes and stops at the coffee machine.


      The nurse acknowledges him as she pops some coins in and 
      selects her coffee. 

      Ali just half smiles. 

      She pulls out her coffee from the tray and takes a sip. He 
      looks at her -- wanting one.

      She smiles and walks off. 


      Adam, Colin and Malcolm -- watching.

                                  COLIN
                    Go on. You know you want to.

                                    MALCOLM
                      I wouldn t mind one right now.

                                  ADAM
                    He s going for it.

      ON SCREEN: Ali goes to the machine, reads his options, fishes 
      some coins out, pops one in and selects his coffee.

      Malcolm hits some controls on a REMOTE CONTROL unit.


      CLOSE UP: COFFEE DISPENSER CAVITY: the cup plops down.

      ZOOM INTO THE MACHINE: A smaller nozzle -- tucked in behind 
      the one that spews out the normal coffee -- comes alive, 
      squirting a clear liquid into the cup as it fills with 
      coffee.

      ALI

      Takes out the coffee, heads back to a seat as the coughing 
      man moves away, and sits down. He warms his hands on the cup 
      before taking a sip, then another.


      Adam, Malcolm, Colin -- elated.

                                  ADAM
                    How much time do we have?

                                    MALCOLM
                    It should kick in in about five 
                    minutes, then you ve got at least 
                    half an hour.

                                  ADAM
                    Good job.


      Adam, in hospital garb, reaches Ali, who s sound asleep on 
      the chair. He leans down, and checks him. He s out. He 
      replaces Ali s cup with a discarded one, chucks Ali s in the 
      bin instead, and continues, talking into his lapel mike.

                    A little magic potion we came up

                    You wanted to talk. We don t have

      Barzali takes a beat. He s not in great shape, and this is a 
      huge, dangerous step for him. He summons up his courage.

                                    BARZALI
                    We don t want to turn into another

                                  ADAM
                    It s easily taken care of. Stop

                    get out of Lebanon and hold some 
                    real elections for a change.

                                    BARZALI
                    You joke, but the people in the 
                    streets are talking about the 
                    elections in Iraq. They re

      Ali stirs, wakes up, heavy headed. He sits up, looks around,

      He gets up, and heads towards Barzali s room.


      Ali swings the door open --

      Adam s gone. Barzali s sounds asleep. Ali looks around. 
      Nothing suspicious.

                    How will you be settling the bill?

      Ali looks at Barzali. Barzali nods for him to take care of 
      it.

                                  JENNY (cont d)
                    This way.

      She leads him out --

                                  ADAM
                    We can do business, but we need 
                    something from you first. To 
                    convince everyone you can deliver.

                                    BARZALI
                    What is it?





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   42.

                                  ADAM
                          (keeping an eye out for Ali)
                    Iraqi insurgents are going back and 
                    forth across your border like it 
                    wasn t even there, bringing back 
                    money and weapons which they re 
                    using to kill British troops. 
                          (beat)
                    We need crossing points, smuggling 
                    routes, timings. Specifics to help

                    the information and we can do 
                    business.

      As Ali steps back in. Adam removes the blood pressure wrap, 
      smiles.

                                  ADAM (cont d)
                    Take it easy for a few days. And 
                    drink lots of water.


      Ruth sits with Colin, watching the footage from the opening 
      night that she was looking at earlier.

                                  RUTH
                    You see that? Right there.

      She pauses it.

      ON SCREEN: The image freezes on Shalhoob, making his call.

                                  RUTH (cont d)
                    I can t make out what he s saying, 
                    too much noise around. And then the 
                    camera moves away anyway.
                          (beat)
                    But then he s not far from Jo. And 
                    she was wired.

                                  COLIN
                    Her mike might have picked up 
                      something.

                                  RUTH
                    Exactly. At least we d have audio.

                                  COLIN
                    I ll try and isolate it.


      Barzali walks into his suite -- and stops in his tracks. 
      Waiting for him is the OLDER KUWAITI from the plane. Shalhoob 
      is also there.

                                    BARZALI
                          (nervous surprise, subtitles)
                    No one told me you were --

      Before Barzali can even finish his sentence, Kareem appears 
      from behind the door, lifts up a metal rod the length of a 
      baseball bat and swings it full strength against the back of 
      Barzali s legs.

      Barzali goes down, in massive pain. He clutches his legs in 
      agony as the Kuwaiti moves in, looming over him.

                                    BARZALI (cont d)
                          (subtitles)
                    What are you doing? My leg --

      But the Kuwaiti is unmoved. He calmly gestures for the rod 
      from Kareem, who hands it to him. 

      He swings it over his head, and brings it down on Barzali 
      berating him angrily in Arabic --

      Barzali cowers but can t deflect the massive blow and SCREAMS 
      in pain --


      Afternoon. Fiona, fidgety, finds Ruth --

                                  FIONA
                    Any updates from immigration?

                                  RUTH
                    Not since this morning s lot.
                          (sees her nervousness)
                    Are you okay?

      Before Fiona can answer, her phone RINGS. She looks at it, 
      nods at Ruth like  it s him .

                                  FIONA
                    Emma Stratstone.
                          (beat, smiles, into phone)
                    Mr Barzali. 


      Colin sits before his computers, earphones on, working on 
      isolating the audio from the opening night.

      He s like a DJ, fiddling with his onscreen control panel 
      while trying to pluck out Shalhoob s CONVERSATION from a 
      cacophony of different CONVERSATIONS going on in the busy 
      room.

      He s getting there -- but it s still very garbled.


      Dusk. Fiona, Harry, Adam.

                                  FIONA
                    The presentation is confirmed for 
                    tomorrow afternoon at Barzali s 
                    hotel. He s booked a meeting room 
                    there. 

                                  HARRY
                    The boffins in research came up 
                    with these proposals for your 
                    pitch. They re scarily effective. 

                                  ADAM
                          (to Fiona)
                    He ll be able to justify the time 
                    spent with you without a hitch.
                          (beat)
                    We ll have a team outside the 
                    hotel. Any sign that he s been 
                    rumbled, you get out of there.

                                  FIONA
                    I ll be fine.

      He looks at her. It s almost as if she s trying to convince 
      herself.


      It s late. Fiona s in bed, but she s awake, unable to sleep. 
      Staring at the ceiling.

      Her mobile BEEPS, lighting up in the darkness. She takes it.

      CLOSE ON THE PHONE S SCREEN: It s Adam.

      She answers.

                                  FIONA
                    What s wrong?

                                  ADAM (O.S.)
                    Open the door and find out.

      She does a double take, climbs out of bed, grabs the gun and--                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   45.




      She opens the door, slightly panicked. Adam s standing there.

                                  FIONA
                    What are you doing here?

                                  ADAM
                    Conjugal visit. I miss my wife.

                                  FIONA
                    You can t stay. 

                                  ADAM
                    No one saw me --

                                  FIONA
                          (interrupting, dead serious)
                    You have to leave. Now.

      She tries to lead him back out -- and he SEES the gun in her 
      hand.

                                  ADAM
                    What are you doing with that? 

                                  FIONA
                    You have to go. The whole point of 
                    my being here is so you don t get 
                    spotted, remember?

                                  ADAM
                    We ve got this place covered. And 
                    we made sure you weren t followed 
                    here.

                                  FIONA
                    If I m here, it means there s a 
                    risk. 

                                  ADAM
                    You re the one who insisted on 
                    staying here. I mean, come on, 
                    what s going on here? You ve got 
                    Ruth feeding you immigration 
                    records, you re requisitioning 
                    weapons without telling me --

                    alright? 

                                  ADAM
                    Me?

                                  FIONA
                    They almost killed you once because 
                    of me. I can t let it happen again. 
                    Now leave. Go.

      A beat. Adam looks at her, frustrated.

                                  ADAM
                    This ends tomorrow. You get the 
                      information from him, and you re 
                    done.

                                  FIONA
                    Fine. Would you please get the hell 
                    out of here now.

      He pushes him out and shuts the door. She stands against the 
      door, heart racing.

      OFF ADAM -- he doesn t like this.


      Fiona turns to Jo, urgently --

                                  FIONA
                    Go to the magazine stall, somewhere 
                    out of sight. Wait five minutes and 
                    call me. If I don t pick up the 
                    phone, red flash Adam.

                                  JO
                    What are you talki--

                          (interrupting)
                    I need you to do this.

                                  JO
                    I can t let you go in there alone. 
                    No way. That s not the plan.

                                  FIONA
                    Please, Jo. I know what I m doing. 
                    You ve got to trust me on this.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   47.

                          (interrupting)
                    They know who I am. They recognized 
                    me at the party. 

                                  JO
                    At the party? But --

                          (interrupting)
                    I wanted them to know it was me. 
                    Look, I can t explain it right now. 
                    Just go. If something goes wrong in 
                    there, I d rather have you out here 
                    calling in the cavalry.

      She nudges her away -- Jo edges away, reluctantly, worried 
      now as Fiona sees ALI coming towards her from the lobby. Her 
      hand dives into her handbag and pulls out her KEYS with the 
      gun FOB as he reaches her. She smiles.

                                  ALI
                    You re alone?

                    Vanessa had to take care of

                    This way.


      Colin plays the cleaned conversation for Ruth who listens 
      intently. We HEAR Shalhoob s DISTORTED Arabic words -- 

                                  COLIN
                    It s the best I could do.

      -- but Ruth s concentrating. She translates:

                     Guess who I m looking at right 
                    now .

      A beat. There s a pause while the other side of the 
        conversation talks. Then we hear Shalhoob s answer, and 
      Ruth s face freezes.

                                  COLIN
                    What?

                    It s used when someone goes

      Ali swings the door open and beckons Fiona in. She steps into 
      the room. Barzali s in a chair.

                                  FIONA
                    Mr Barzali --

      And SEES it:

      BARZALI s lying on the ground, dead. His face is bruised 
      horribly, his throat s slit.

      She turns -- Kareem and Ali are rushing her --

      She raises the gunfob but Ali hits her arm, knocking it out 
      of her hand as she YELLS in pain --

      They re quickly on her, grabbing her, PINNING her down --


      Jo, waiting, nervous, desperate to do something --


      Ruth, with Adam and Harry -- urgent:

                                  RUTH
                    He recognized her and called 
                    someone about it. I m sure of it.

      Adam s already speed-dialing his cellphone --


      Fiona s led by Ali and Kareem to a waiting car. He looks 
      around and pops the boot open when her cellphone RINGS. 

      Ali fishes it out, drops it to the ground and STOMPS on it, 
      shattering it to bits.


      Adam calling, Harry, Ruth -- Colin and Zaf converge too --

      Joumana looks at her. She can t bring herself to say it, but 
      it s obviously horrible. She shakes her head, sobbing.

                                  FIONA (cont d)
                    What about Leena...? 

      Joumana shakes her head. It s not good.

      Ali moves over to the other car and pops its boot. Fiona s

                    Get in.

      CLOSE ON HER NECK: her fingers desperately grope for it, 
      trying to pick it off and get rid of the tape without getting 
      noticed, but it s stuck -- she can t do it.

      She heads for the new car -- cautiously, towards the open 
      door. Trying to keep them in her eyeline, but they re spread 
      out and it s impossible to keep the back of her head away 
      from both of them -- but manages it.

                    Quickly.

      She starts climbing into the boot -- it s an awkward 
      manoeuvre. Heart pounding, she does it -- 

      She s about to bend down when Ali spots something --

                    GCHQ s got Shalhoob s conversation

                    No. They re running the voice 
                    through the database. But I just 
                    ran a trace on the number. Whoever 
                    he called is here. In the UK.

      Ali and the underling push a blindfolded and mouth-taped 
      Fiona into the jet whose engines are SCREAMING, ready to taxi 
      off, and throw her into a big leather seat.

      The Arab boss looks angrily outside, thinking. Wants to wait,

      The Arab nods, impressed that she s not surprised. And we 
      realize it s Farook -- only with no moustache and some subtle 
      plastic surgery, just enough to make him unrecognizable.

      Harry, Ruth, Colin -- urgent --

                    If they didn t hang him, it can 
                    only mean one thing.


      Rushing --

                                  ADAM
                    He was a double agent. He was 
                    really working for the Syrians all 
                    along.
                          (beat)
                    She knew he was still alive. 
                    Somehow, she found out. 

      INTERCUT WITH THE GRID

                                  HARRY
                    Why didn t she tell you?

                                  ADAM
                    She said she was tired of hiding.


      The engines are now screaming at FULL THROTTLE --

                    Hang on. We wouldn t want that

                    It s in Sussex.

                    They ve taken off.

                    Fake Kuwaiti passports are a dime a 
                    dozen since the invasion. We should

      Farook looms over Fiona, studying her, touching her hair.

                                  FAROOK
                    What have you done to yourself? 
                    This short hair... And you look so 
                    pale. 
                          (beat, sniffs her)
                    And what s that horrible perfume 
                    you re using?
                          (beat)
                    This won t do. We re going to have 
                    to change all that.

      Fiona looks at him with fear and hatred.

                                  FIONA
                    Leena. Joumana. Why did you have to 
                    come after them like that.

                                  FAROOK
                    I wanted to find you.

                                  FIONA
                    Leena killed herself. Because of 
                    what your men did to her.

                                  FAROOK
                    She wasn t as strong as you ve 
                    turned out to be. I m impressed. 
                    Working for MI5. Helping traitors.

                                  FIONA
                    Barzali isn t a traitor. He wanted 
                    to save your country.

      Farook laughs, ridiculing her.

                                  FAROOK
                    Barzali wanted to save his pride.

      Fiona looks at him like  ...what?  

                                  FAROOK (cont d)
                    The head of the Mukhabarat he

      Which REALLY SHOCKS and FLOORS Fiona -- it s the last thing 
      she wanted him to discover. 

                                  FAROOK (cont'd)
                          (beat, OFF her surprise)
                    Is bigamy allowed in England now?

                                  FAROOK
                    Let me worry about that. You should 
                    be more concerned about your own

                    before he comes out to Damascus to 
                    find you?

      He watches her. She s shivering. REALLY looks bad now. All is 
      lost. She curls over, clutching her belly.

                                  FIONA
                    I need to use the bathroom.

                                  FAROOK

                    I m... going to throw up.

      Farook studies her. She really looks like a wreck. He looks 
      at Ali. Ali nods like she s been thoroughly checked. 

      Farook nods to her. Ali gets her up and walks her to the 
      small toilet. He stands by the door as she goes in.                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   63.




      Fiona closes the door behind her. She holds onto the sink 
      unit, stares into the mirror. Lost. Broken. Hopeless. A tear 
      trickles down her cheek. What have I done?

      She stares at her face. Mind in turmoil.

      FLASHBACK to Joumana crying as she tells her about what 
      happened. 

      FLASHBACK to Adam being beaten half to death by Farook and 
      his men.

      She looks at herself. She shuts her eyes. Like someone who s 
      lost all hope. 

      She looks around. Searching for any hope. Desperate. 
      Devastated. Beaten. 

      Nothing. 

      She looks back at her broken self the mirror.

      Then she gets an idea. Her expression changes. A wave of 
      determination surges over her.

      She stares into the mirror -- and LOCKS the door before 
      SMASHING the mirror with her fist.


      Ali, the Arab and Farook react to the sound of the locking 
      door and the shattered glass -- first surprised, unsure of 
      what it is, then realizing it could be something. They rush 
      to the door --


      Fiona, in a panic, the door getting pounded from outside and 
      about to be kicked in, sitting on the toilet, using a long 
      shard of mirror to CUT into her wrists -- NOT THE UNDERSIDE 
      that one expects in a suicide attempt, but the UPPER SIDE, 
      and SMEARING BLOOD down to the palm side to simulate the 
      suicide cuts --


      Ali KICKS the door in to reveal --

      FIONA, sitting on the loo, BLOOD oozing down from her wrists--

      FAROOK looks at her in shock --

                                  FIONA
                    You ll have to land. I ll never

                    And you ll have nothing to use 
                    against Adam.

      Farook, in a panic, shouting at ALI --

                                  FAROOK
                          (in Arabic, with subtitles)
                    GET ME THE MEDICAL KIT!

      Farook lifts her up -- carries her out into the main cabin --

      CLOSE ON FIONA S HAND -- as she SLIPS OUT a long, pointed 
      SHARD OF GLASS from her shirt -- and holds it FIRMLY --

      Her hand WHIPS UP quickly -- expertly STABBING the shard deep 
      into FAROOK s jugular vein --

      He tumbles back, grasping his neck from which BLOOD erupts --

      ALI and the THIRD ARAB, at the back of the cabin, react, 
      grabbing their weapons --

      She SPOTS Farook s gun in his belt, grabs it and pushes 
      Farook back at them while firing --

      She hits the underling in the chest, he goes down, but --

      In his panic and unbalance from Farook s body, Ali lets rip a 
      long BURST OF SILENCED GUNFIRE --

      BULLETS bite into the cabin s interior, including the 
      partition leading to the cockpit --

      Before he s hit by Fiona s bullets and slumps --

      She stands up, then drops down in pain. She looks down at her 
      side -- she s been hit, a blood patch swelling to her side.

      In pain, she looks at the cockpit door. SEES the bullet holes 
      through it. 


      Fiona staggers into the cockpit to find the PILOT dead at the 
      controls, BLOOD splattered on the windshield.

      She collapses to the floor, barely conscious --

      And we HEAR the plane s engine noise change -- it s going 
      down --


      Harry, on the phone --

                                  HARRY
                    Adam, listen to me --

                          (beat, horrified)
                    They re over water.

      Colin shouts over from another position --

                                  COLIN
                    I ve got Fiona. She s on the

      Ruth, Harry, Colin, eyes glued to the radar feed --

                                  RUTH
                    It s dropping too fast. It s 
                    dropping way too fast!

      ON SCREEN: We can see the green RADAR BLIP of the plane, with 
      its MARKINGS flashing next to it, and the ALTITUDE READING 
      scrolling down vertiginously, crashing through 15,000 feet, 
      then 10,000, then 5,000 --


      Fiona, on the floor, hanging on against the NOISE of the 
      plummeting plane --

      All eyes are on the screen -- watching as

      THE BLIP s altitude reading hurtles down towards zero.

                                  FIONA (O.S.)
                    I love you. Always have, always

                    ADAM!

      And the reading scrolls down to ZERO and the BLIP disappears. 
      Just like that. In silence. Like it never existed.

      Ruth looks at Harry -- stunned.
