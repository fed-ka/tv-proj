  FADE IN:


  INT. THE LAMPLIGHTER - NIGHT

  A dimly lit tavern where every hour is happy hour. In ONE 
  SHOT that will last the scene, we move down a mile-long bar 
  filled with booze-happy REGULARS, through leatherette 
  booths, and stop on a small karaoke stage. Everyone cheers 
  as the immensely likable and slightly overweight MR. MARTIN, 
  30s, starts singing to the tune of The Archies  Sugar, 
  Sugar.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                              Glucose!--!ah,!sugar!sugar.!You!are!

  CAMERA ROAMS to the dance floor, where the crowd bumps and 
  grinds. A lacy bra flies on stage, TAKING US back to Mr. 
  Martin, clearly a favorite here. He gamely swivels his hips.

                                        MR. MARTIN(cont'd)

  A sexy REDHEAD runs on stage and starts go-go dancing. Mr. 
  Martin sings to her for all he s worth.

                                        MR. MARTIN(cont'd)

  FREEZE FRAME on Mr. Martin, in all his small-time glory, and 
  WHOOSH to his smiling face. The words appear under him:

                                      The Victim

                                                                  FLARE TO WHITE.                                                                                    2.


  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

  FADE FROM WHITE to a bank of STADIUM LIGHTS. In another ONE- 
  SHOT scene, we SWOOP DOWN, SkyCam-style, over the action of 
  a high school football game. The ball is snapped. Shoulder 
  pads crunch. A hole opens. A RUNNING BACK bursts through the 
  line, racing for a touchdown for the Waverly Tigers.

  As the crowd roars, we VEER off the running back, GLIDE over 
  a squad of impossibly buoyant cheerleaders, and into the 
  stands past cheering students, parents and faculty, until we 
  reach --


  THE MARCHING BAND

  playing a VICTORY SONG. We MOVE DOWN a row of the colorfully 
  dressed band to the very end, to find a bored bass drummer 
  named TOM, 17, wearing a headpiece with an ostrich feather.

  TILT UP to two STONERS standing behind a rail.

                                        STONER
                      You guys play any Foo Fighters?

  BACK to Tom, used to this sort of abuse. He keeps playing, 
  face expressionless, eyes front. One stoner leans over the 
  rail and snaps Tom s feather in half, so it flops down.

                                          STONER(cont'd)
                        Oops, I think you need a new 
                        feather.

  They crack up, but Tom doesn t react. The other stoner leans 
  over and dumps beer onto Tom s headpiece. The stoners laugh 
    hysterically. Tom never even flinches. FREEZE and WHOOSH to 
  the wet face of the unflappable drummer. The words appear:

                                      The Killer

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK.


  EXT. MARTIN HOUSE - NIGHT

  FADE FROM BLACK to a nighttime sky full of stars. TILT DOWN 
  to a 1985 Camaro with mismatched body panels pulling up to a 
  modest two-story house in the San Fernando Valley. Two 
  patrol cars sit outside, light bars spinning a kaleidoscope 
  of colors. NEIGHBORS mill on the sidewalk to see what s up.

  The Camaro stops and a sexy woman, mid-30s, exits in stone- 
  wash jeans. Her lipstick is a touch too red, her roots are 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

  showing, and her tight-fitting NASCAR T-shirt makes no 
  secret of her flat chest. But she s proud of her look. It s 
  the closest thing she has to heritage.

  This is LAPD Detective ANGIE SNOW. She puts on a  LAPD 
  Homicide  cap and pulls a business jacket over her 
  shoulders.


  IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE

  Snow steps through the milling neighbors, some of whom are 
  standing on the lawn. She pulls a DIGITAL CAMERA from her 
  coat pocket and turns back to face the onlookers.

                                        SNOW
                        Smile for the camera, please.

  She snaps FLASH photos of the surprised crowd, then gets the 
  attention of two UNIFORM OFFICERS, who are quietly talking.

                                          SNOW(cont'd)
                      Hey guys. Keep  em off the grass, 
                        okay?

                                        UNIFORM OFFICER
                        Sorry, detective. Didn t know this 
                      was part of the crime scene.

                                        SNOW
                        It s not. It s just nice grass.

  As Snow heads up the walk, the officers move back the crowd.


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - NIGHT

  Snow walks upstairs with LAPD Detective OSCAR VEGA, 40s, 
  Latino, a seasoned veteran who moonlights as an ordained 
  minister. They pull on rubber gloves as they talk.

                                        VEGA
                        Working on a great sermon for

                        It ll be real interesting.

                                        SNOW
                      No such thing as an interesting 
                        sermon.

                                        VEGA
                        You ve never heard me preach.

                        comparing the Fruits of the Spirit 
                      to actual fruit.

  Snow gives him a look. You gotta be kidding.

                                        SNOW
                        Moving on, Oscar.

                                        VEGA
                        Right, white male. Thirty-two. Wife 
                        says he was attacked in bed. 
                        They re walking down the hallway 
                        now.

                      Who was the attacker?

                                        VEGA
                      We don t know, but he apparently 
                        calls himself  The Creeper.  At 
                        least that s what was written on 
                      the refrigerator door.

                        Where was the wife during the 
                        attack?

                        Says she was sleeping in the spare 
                        room.

  They reach the FIRST OFFICER, standing outside a closed 
  door.

                                        SNOW
                        Victim in here?

                        inhibiting access to the body.

                                        SNOW
                        Same principles apply. It s all 
                        about taking control. Snow opens 
                      the door and confidently steps 
                        inside.


  INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

  On the queen bed, she sees the body of Mr. Martin on his 
  back, head on a blood-soaked pillow, face beaten and 
  bloodied. And then she sees the powerful PRESA CANARIO 
  attack dog standing by the bed, growling menacingly. Snow 
  speaks firmly.

                                        SNOW
                        Sit!

                                  intensifies)
                        I said... sit!
                                (the growl turns 
                                  rabid)
                      If you don t sit, right now --

  The dog charges. Shit. Snow barely has time to run out --


  INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

  -- and slam the door. The dog BARKS relentlessly on the 
  other side.

  Snow looks at Vega.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                      out by the weeds of pride.

  Snow smiles weakly. As the dog barks, CAMERA RISES straight 
  up, THROUGH the plaster of the ceiling, to reveal directly 
  over their heads --


  INT. ATTIC CRAWLSPACE   NIGHT

  In a gabled attic, filtered moonlight through an air vent 
  finds Tom curled up in a fetal position, frozen in terror. 
  He wears bloody white band gloves. Beside him rests his 
  backpack covered with skateboard patches.

  Tom s world has just changed forever. As he closes his eyes 
  tightly, willing the nightmare to go away, trying to shut 
  out the MUFFLED BARKING below --

  An ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER leads the muzzled Presa Canario 
  down the front walk. The scene has expanded to include a 
  coroner s truck, two more patrol cars, and a larger crowd of 
  neighbors. None of them stand on the grass. PUSH INTO the 
  upstairs bedroom window until we are --


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

  Snow takes photos of the body with her digital camera. Vega

  As Vega enters, followed by the First Officer, a crime scene 
    PHOTOGRAPHER, and the CORONER, we FLOAT over to the bed 
  until we re looking straight down on the battered Mr. 
  Martin. PUSH INTO his face. Suddenly, Mr. Martin s injuries 
  DISAPPEAR, he comes to life, and the bedsheets around him 
  SWIRL INTO --


  INT. THE LAMPLIGHTER - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Mr. Martin sits at the bar holding a beer. The Redhead who 
  was go-go dancing on stage hangs all over him. HOUSE MUSIC 
  plays in the background. A CHYRON appears on screen that 
  says: Four Hours Earlier.

                        sexy.

                        such a gift. Will you take me home 
                        tonight?

  He holds up his ring finger, which has a gold band.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        Sorry, I m a happily married man.

  Off his tired smile --


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  BARB MARTIN, Mr. Martin s wife, folds laundry on the kitchen 
  table. She s a plain woman, bored with life.

                                        MRS. MARTIN
                      For God s sake, Glenn. How long s 
                      it take to walk a dog?

  Mr. Martin unleashes the Presa Canario, which trots off.

                        I stopped by The Lamplighter. Can

                        A little. Doesn t mean we can t 
                        talk. Might even make it easier.

                                        MRS. MARTIN
                        What do you want to talk about?

                      It doesn t feel that way, Barb. 
                        You re so far away. All the time. 
                        What d I do, baby? I can t figure 
                      it out. Just tell me and I ll make 
                      it right, okay?

  Mrs. Martin stops folding and looks up. Seeing her husband 
  so raw, she feels a touch of sympathy. Or maybe it s pity.

                                        MRS. MARTIN
                        We ll talk in the morning, Glenn. I 
                        promise. Go upstairs and sleep it 
                        off.

  She resumes folding. As Mr. Martin heavily trudges to the 
  stairs, a DRUM CADENCE starts playing. The rhythm takes us 
  --


  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  CLOSE on Tom, headpiece wet and feather dangling, banging 
  his bass drum. The band marches out of the stadium after the 
  game, 80 pairs of feet tapping the pavement in unison to the 
  hypnotic beat. Behind them, football players shake hands on 
  the field and the crowd files out.


  INT. BAND ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  The band members break ranks and flood into the band room, 
  laughing and joking. FIND Tom putting down his drum. He 
  removes his headpiece, sees the broken feather, holds it 
  straight. It flops back down. Oh well. WILLIE, a long- 
  haired skate rat, walks up and sees everyone changing.

    A big-bellied TUBA PLAYER struts by with no pants.

                                        TUBA PLAYER
                        It's the new sensation sweeping the 
                        nation... the No Pants Dance!

  He starts playing the tuba and dancing around in his band 
  jacket and underwear. The trombonists join in the act with 
   headchops  -- rapidly bending and crossing over each 
  other s heads with trombones. A pretty and petite girl named 
  KRISTI calls out.

  A paramedic tries to resuscitate Patrick Swayze in the back 
  of an ambulance. After a beat, the paramedic looks up at 
  Demi Moore with a hopeless expression. REVEAL that we re --

  INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Tom s MOM and DAD sit on a well worn couch, zoning in front 
  of the TV watching  Ghost.  A lazy mixed-breed TERRIER lies 
  with his head in Dad s lap. Tom enters the messy living 
  room.

                                        TOM
                      Hi, I m home.

                      Hi honey.

  But his parents are too engrossed in Patrick s death scene 
  to look up. They remain glued to the TV, where the ghost of 
  Patrick, also in the ambulance, yells at the paramedic --

                                        PATRICK SWAYZE
                        Don t stop! I m not dead!

                        Okay, I m going to bed. G night.

  Tom heads to his room. His Dad waves goodnight, but keep his 
  eyes on the TV, where Demi grabs the dead Patrick and begins 
  to cry in long terrible sobs.                                                                                    12.


  INT. APARTMENT - TOM S BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Tom enters his room, shuts the door, and turns off the

  night.


  EXT. WOODBRIDGE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  A beater car, dented and mottled with a grey undercoat, 
  pulls to a stop in front of the park. The rattling engine 
  stops.

  Willie turns off the lights and looks at Tom.

  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Snow stands with the startling image of Mrs. Martin in a 
  sexy nightgown smeared with blood, along with her hands and 
  arms.

                        Martin.

  The crime scene photographer takes close-up shots of all the 
  blood on Mrs. Martin. Vega, hovering silently, points to 
  some blood on her leg. The photographer kneels down to shoot 
  it. Snow tries to keep her calm.

                                          SNOW(cont'd)

                        loved him. Why... why would...

  She just can t make sense of it. She fights back tears. The 
    photographer finishes. Snow nods and the two men quietly 
  leave the room, shutting the door behind them.

                                        SNOW
                        Mrs. Snow, we need to record your

  Mrs. Martin waits for the detective to leave but she 
  doesn t.

                      Oh.

  Mrs. Martin, humiliated, awkwardly slips off her nightgown, 
  trying her best to cover her body. Snow politely looks away. 
  She spots a romance novel and batteries on the nightstand.

                                        MRS. MARTIN(cont'd)

                      You get dressed. We ll talk 
                        afterward.

  Snow heads out with the nightgown. HOLD on the face of Mrs. 
  Martin, bloody, shocked, distraught. Suddenly, the blood on 
  her DISAPPEARS and the room around her SWIRLS INTO --


  INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Mrs. Martin, wearing what we saw her in earlier, clears the 
  top of the stairs carrying the basket of now folded laundry.


  INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  She enters to find Mr. Martin passed out in bed, with a loud 
  chainsaw SNORE. He appears to have gotten halfway undressed 
  before he crashed. Setting down the laundry basket, Mrs. 
  Martin smiles at her husband and pulls the blanket over him.


  INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Mrs. Martin stands outside the bedroom door, eagerly hunched 
  over the cordless phone. We still hear Mr. Martin snoring.

                        out. If we go in the guest room

  EXT. MARTIN HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Mrs. Martin, who has now changed into her sexy nightgown, 
  drags the unwilling Presa Canario into the backyard.


  EXT. MARTIN HOUSE - STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  An old Chevy panel van, black and beat up, pulls to a stop 
  in front of the Martin house. The van door opens, revealing 
  red fur on the inside panel, and a 19-year-old Russian buck 
  named ARMAN POZNER steps out.

  He closes the van door with an eager smile. As he walks INTO 
  CAMERA, his wildly oversized belt buckle gets bigger and 
  bigger, until it finally fills the screen, and we SMASH TO

  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Mrs. Martin yanks Arman into the spare bedroom, kissing him, 
  mauling him, sliding her hands under his jeans to grab his 
  firm young ass. Arman can t wipe the smile off his face.

                                        ARMAN
                        This is crazy. Why I came to 
                        America.

  Mrs. Martin starts to unbuckle the Russian s belt. CLOSE on 
  her face, impetuous, naughty. Abruptly, we CUT TO --

  INT. ATTIC CRAWLSPACE   NIGHT

  Tom sits up now, still afraid, but pulling himself together. 
  From below, he hears the MUFFLED VOICES of police officers. 
  Tom looks around his prison searching for an escape. His 
  eyes stop on the gable vent pouring in filtered moonlight.


  CLOSE ON THE GABLE VENT

  Tom ENTERS FRAME and tries to pull the vent free. No luck. 
  Screws hold it in place. Tom s fear is fast fading in favor 
  of self preservation. He pulls a handful of coins from his 
  pocket, finds a penny, and inserts it into the head of the 
  screw. With some effort, the screw rotates a quarter turn.

  vent, CAMERA LOWERS straight down, THROUGH the ceiling

                      No. This one s perfect.

                      But they re still awake.

                                        TOM
                        Yeah. Cool, huh?

                                        WILLIE
                        Fine. Let s find a souvenir and go.

  Tom disappears into a different room to search. STAY with 
  Willie, who walks to the kitchen. He takes out a pen and 
  writes  The Creeper  on the refrigerator door.

  IN THE LIVING ROOM Willie, swigging a beer bottle, finds Tom 
  in the living room.

                                          WILLIE(cont'd)
                        There s some icy cold ones in 
                        there.

                                        TOM
                        Nothing for me.

  Tom is desperately searching for something. It seems like 
  he s searching for something specific. Willie is impatient.

                                        WILLIE
                        C mon, grab something and let s go. 
                        That ceramic hula girl looks 
                        perfect.

                                        TOM
                        I don t want that.

                                        WILLIE
                      You shopping for something 
                        specific?  Cause I can drive you to 
                      the mall.

  Abruptly, they hear a DOOR OPEN and giggling.

                                        ARMAN (O.S.)
                        Thank you for phone call. I hope to 
                      see you soon.

  Tom and Willie exchange a look of panic. Willie hurriedly 
  sets down his beer but knocks it over as he and Tom race out 
  the front door.


  EXT. WOODBRIDGE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Tom and Willie run up to the car, out of breath. Willie is 
  pumped, laughing, high with adrenaline.

                                        WILLIE
                        That was so close! Who was that guy 
                        doing the Governator?

  But Tom, taking off his white gloves, seems disappointed.

                                          WILLIE(cont'd)
                        C mon, let s get stoned now. I know 
                        a guy who sells the chronic.

                                        TOM
                      Not for me. That s a wrap.

  Tom puts his hands in his pockets and starts walking away.

                                        WILLIE
                        What are you doing?

                                        TOM
                      My apartment s only a few blocks 
                        away.

                                        WILLIE
                        You re going home? Dude. For 
                        someone who likes to live on the 
                        edge, you can be a total buzzkill.

  STAY with Tom walking off as Willie gets in his car and 
  drives away. Tom turns around to make sure he s gone, then 
  abruptly changes direction and heads back toward Mr. 
  Martin s house.

                                        CORONER (O.S.)
                      We got blunt-force trauma to the 
                        head. Contusions around the neck...


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

  The gruesome sight of Mr. Martin s bloodied and battered 
  face. Vega watches the coroner examine the body. Mr. 
  Martin s hands are now bagged to protect trace evidence.

                                        CORONER
                      No apparent defense wounds. Victim 
                        might have been asleep at the time 
                      of attack.

  Behind them, Snow slowly circles the room, looking for 
  anything out of place.

                                        SNOW
                      He wasn t sleeping. His wife heard 
                      him shouting.

                                to the coroner)(
                        What about the time of death?

  The coroner removes a meat thermometer inserted deeply into 
  the area below Mr. Martin s rib cage and checks the reading.

                                        CORONER
                        95.6 degrees. Based on liver temp, 
                      the victim s been dead two to three 
                        hours.

                                  checks his watch)(
                      So somewhere around midnight.

  Snow stands over a dresser.

                                        SNOW
                        Hey, didn t Lucas say nothing of 
                        value was missing?

                                        VEGA
                        That s right.

                                        SNOW
                        Take a look at this.

  Vega joins Snow to find a dusty dresser top full of bowling 
  trophies. Snow points to one round area that s dust-free, 
  suggesting a missing trophy.

                                        VEGA
                        Wouldn t exactly classify a bowling 
                        trophy as an object of value.

                                        SNOW
                      It is if it s our murder weapon.

  Vega reacts to that possibility. The room grows DARK as we 
  PAN from Vega to the dusty dresser, where the missing trophy 
  now sits. We are --


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Back in the room before the crime. From the bowling trophy, 
  we PAN to find Mr. Martin snoring peacefully in bed. From 
  there, we MOVE to the window and look out to see Tom walking 
  nervously up to the house.                                                                                    25.


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Tom slips into the house wearing his white gloves and closes 
  the front door. He turns to see the Presa Canario, haunches 
  up, growling menacingly. Oddly, he smiles.

                                        TOM
                      Hey Skipper... come here, boy.

  The dog stops growling. Tom drops to a knee and Skipper 
  comes to him, tail wagging, and slathers his face with dog 
  licks. Tom scratches behind his ear, just the way Skipper 
  likes it.

  In a SERIES OF CUTS, Tom searches the house... an office... 
    a bathroom.... inside a closet... before opening the door to 
  --


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Tom sees Mr. Martin crashed in bed. And on the floor by the 
  bed, Tom spots what he came for -- his backpack covered with 
  skateboard patches.

  Tom creeps over to retrieve it. He s almost there... when 
  Mr. Martin stirs and opens his eyes. Seeing a figure in his 
  room, he sits up with a start -- and recognizes the 
  intruder.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        Tom? Is that you?

  Tom is busted but he wants the backpack. Off his indecision 
  --


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Mrs. Martin, asleep in the spare room, wakes to the sound of 
  DISTANT SHOUTING. She sits up. What s going on? The yelling 
  suddenly stops. Mrs. Martin fumbles for the light. Turns it 
  on. Finds her slippers.


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Mrs. Martin hurries up the stairs, calling out --

                                        MRS. MARTIN
                        Glenn?                                                                                    26.


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Mrs. Martin enters through the open door. She sees her 
  husband lying motionless on the bed, covered in blood.


  INSIDE THE CLOSET

  Through the closet door that he holds ajar, Tom peeks out to 
  see Mrs. Martin stumble to the bed, sink onto the mattress, 
  and let out a guttural WAIL. Tom shuts the closet door.


  IN THE BEDROOM

  CLOSE ON Mrs. Martin, who collapses over her husband s body 
  in tears. TILT UP to the face of Snow. The detective stands 
  over the bed looking down. The LIGHTS brighten and the room 
  MORPHS back into a crime scene. We are now --


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Back in the room after the crime. Snow stands over the now 
  empty bed. The body has been removed and the coroner is 
  gone. Vega and Lucas watch Snow act out movements as she 
  speaks.

                                        SNOW
                        Okay, so the killer stood over the 
                        bed, grabbed the statue, and whack 
                      -- right?

                        Right. Why?

                                        SNOW
                      No idea. But before the lethal 
                        blow, the victim s wife heard her 
                        husband shouting from the spare 
                        room downstairs.
                                (to Oscar, jabbing

                      Or so she says.
                                  then, continuing)(
                        When she heard the shouts, she 
                        hurried upstairs to check on her 
                        husband.

  Lucas gets what she s going for.

                        How d the killer get away? Not down 
                      the stairs. He would ve run into 
                      the wife.

                                        SNOW
                      So where d he go?

                        I checked the windows in here. They 
                        were all locked. Painted shut, in 
                        fact.

  The detectives look around. Snow spots the open closet door. 
  She walks over and looks inside. Empty. She sees a foreign 
  substance on the ground. Bends down. We GET LOW to see WHITE 
  PARTICLES in the carpet. Snow brushes some into her hand.

                                          VEGA(cont'd)
                        What is it?

                        I don t know. Plaster maybe?

  She looks up to see a 3x3-foot square cut into the ceiling 
  plaster, outlining a removable attic door. Off Snow --


  EXT. MARTIN HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

  A gable vent on the backside of the house pops out. Tom s 
  head peers through. Seeing it s clear, he climbs out with 
  his backpack and then sets the vent back into place.

  Tom scuttles up the roof and peeks over to see the flashing 
  lights of police and emergency vehicles. We FADE TO BLACK --


  INT. ATTIC CRAWLSPACE   NIGHT

  DARKNESS. The 3x3 plaster panel slides back and LIGHT floods 
  the crawlspace from below. After a beat, a head pokes up 
  with a flashlight. It s Snow. She makes a horrible face.

                                        SNOW
                      Oh God, it stinks something fierce 
                      up here.

  INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

  Vega and Lucas stare at the bottom half of Snow, who has 
  climbed built-in shelves in the closet to check the attic.

  Snow shines her flashlight to reveal a glistening PUDDLE on 
  the area of plywood where Tom was hiding.

                      Cat pee?

  Snow shines her flashlight higher to reveal dark red BLOOD 
  STAINS on the beams that Tom was holding onto for support.

                                        SNOW
                        I don t think so.

  She quickly swings her flashlight beam around the dark 
  attic, searching for further signs of human presence.

                        Lucas, get outside, fast. Tell the 
                        blue suits to expand the perimeter, 
                      and lock it down. We might have a 
                        killer on the property.

  Off her urgency --

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.

  FADE IN:


  EXT. MARTIN HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

  Tom scrambles down the roof toward the backyard. He stops 
  and glances down, measuring his chances of a successful 
  jump. There s grass to land on but he has to clear a 
  concrete patio.


  EXT. MARTIN HOUSE - SIDE YARD - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

  The side door opens and Lucas steps out with the two uniform 
  officers we established out front in the teaser.

                        yards.


  EXT. MARTIN HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

  Tom gathers his courage -- and leaps outward, barely 
  clearing the pavers. He hits the grass, rolls, and runs into 
  a dark hedge. After a beat, an officer enters the yard to 
  search.


  EXT. MARTIN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

                        sent a couple of SID guys up there 
                      to gather evidence.

  They stop on the porch when Lucas joins them from out front.

                                        LUCAS
                      We conducted a thorough search of 
                      the surrounding area. Nothing.

                                        SNOW
                      We screwed up. The offender was in 
                      the house while we were 
                        investigating.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

                      Not in the house, in the attic. 
                        Don t be so hard on yourself. He 
                      was probably trapped in the bedroom 
                      and climbed up there before we 
                        came.

                                        SNOW
                        Why d he wait so long to escape? He 
                        waited so long he couldn t hold his 
                        bladder.

                                        LUCAS
                      He just took a human life. Maybe he 
                      was too scared to move.

  Snow turns to scan the faces of the milling crowd, which has 
  grown substantially.

  CAMERA ROAMS to find brooding men, a group of stoned teens, 
  Latino youth -- all possible suspects. She reaches into her 
  jacket and takes out her digital camera.


  ON THE SIDEWALK

  FIND Tom in the middle of the onlookers, backpack over his 
  shoulder, watching the police. As Snow raises her camera, 
  Tom turns away in SLOW MOTION and fades into the night, as 
  --


  ON THE PORCH

  Snow snaps a photo or two. She turns to Vega.

                                        SNOW
                        When they re done in the attic, go 
                        ahead and release the crime scene. 
                        I have to stop by the house and 
                        check on my kid.


  INT. TOM S BEDROOM - NIGHT

  The window slides open and Tom climbs back inside. He unzips 
  his backpack and pulls out the bowling trophy caked with 
  died blood, along with his bloody white gloves. Tom hears a 
  CREAK and looks up to see --

  His sister LULU, 8, standing at the bedroom door in her PJs. 
  She looks at the trophy in his hands.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                        What d you win?

                                        TOM
                        None of your business, Lulu. Go 
                        back to sleep.

  But Lulu keeps staring at the trophy. The terrier slips into 
  the room through the open door and jumps on Tom s bed.

                                        LULU
                        What s all over it?

  Tom shoves the trophy and gloves into a pillowcase.

                                        TOM
                        Just dirt. Go to bed.

                                        LULU
                      If I m tired for my piano lesson in 
                      the morning, I m telling Mom and 
                      Dad you woke me up.

                                        TOM
                      You tell Mom and Dad anything, 
                        you re dead.

  It s an ominous threat from Tom. Lulu makes a face at her 
  big brother and shuts the door. Tom, riddled with anxiety, 
  takes the trophy bundle and hides it on the top shelf of his 
  closet.


  IN BED - LATER

  Tom lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, sweating and 
  scared. He can t sleep. Tom gets up, startling the terrier 
  sleeping at his feet, goes to the closet, and takes down the 
  trophy.

  Tom climbs back into bed and hugs the murder weapon close to 
  his chest as his mind races, trying to figure out what to 
  do.


  EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

  CITY IMAGES establish the Valley at night. An aerial shot of 
  the 101 freeway. The period neon sign over Chris  & Pitt s 
  Bar-B-Q on Victory Blvd. The giant Muffler Man towering over 
  Expert Tune on Sherman Way. The colorful bail bond offices, 
  vintage car lots, and Mexican shops lining Van Nuys Blvd.                                                                                    32.


  EXT. VALLEY HOUSE - NIGHT

  We LAND on a two-bedroom starter house in Panorama City. The 
  poor part. Snow pulls into the driveway in her Camaro.


  INT. VALLEY HOUSE - NIGHT

  Snow enters the house carrying a bag from 7-11 and quietly 
  moves through a dark house, filled with mostly secondhand 
  furniture.

  She hears a noise in the backyard.

  Putting her hand on her gun, she yanks open the sliding 
  glass door and turns on the porch light.


  EXT. VALLEY HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

  Her son MANNY, 16, reclines on a tattered couch, feeling up 
  a shirtless girl named CRYSTAL. He reacts with mild 
  surprise.

                                        MANNY
                      Hey Mom. Thought you were working.

                        Crystal, put on your top.

  As Crystal, who s wearing a bra, reaches for her top, Snow 
  can t help but notice her rather ample breasts.

                                          SNOW(cont'd)

                        Nope. Got  em for my birthday. You

                                        SNOW
                      No. Maybe. How much did they cost?
                                (before she can 
                                  answer)
                        Never mind. Go inside and get 
                        dressed.

  Crystal heads into the house. Snow pulls a LAPD-issue 
    breathalyzer from her purse and hands it to Manny.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

                        What re you doing home?

  Unfazed, he takes the Breathalyzer and blows into it.

                                        SNOW
                        I stopped by to make sure you had 
                        breakfast for the morning. Here.

  She hands him the 7-11 bag. Manny gives the Breathalyzer 
  back to Snow, who checks his blood-alcohol level. Manny 
  pulls a box of powdered donuts from the bag.

                                          SNOW(cont'd)

                      us to make out inside, then put the 
                        couch in the house like normal

                      Not as embarrassing as the plastic 
                        lawn furniture in the living room.

  Manny gets up off the couch. Snow puts her arm around him.

  EXT. LOS ANGELES - MORNING

  The sun rises over downtown.


  INT. APARTMENT - TOM S BEDROOM - MORNING

  CLOSE on the blood-encrusted bowling trophy and bloody 
  gloves inside the pillowcase. Tom checks them, ties off the 
  top of the pillowcase, and shoves it into his backpack.


  INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

  Lulu practices piano with her Mom.

  Nearby, Dad sits with a PARTY PLANNER, a 40-year-old woman 
  with fading beauty, who s showing photos of herself dressed 
  shamelessly in various fairy and princess costumes.

  Tom disappears without ever being seen.


  EXT. ALLEY - DAY

  Tom skateboards down a grungy alley, lined with trash cans 
  and dumpsters. Seeing what he s looking for, Tom hops off 
  his board and picks it up.

  Checking to make sure no one is watching, Tom steps behind a 
  dumpster, unzips his backpack, and pulls out the pillowcase 
  containing the murder weapon. He drops the bundle into the 
  empty dumpster and closes the lid.

                        I work with Arman at the 99 Cent 
                        Store. He needed a down payment for

                        passed out, but he had nothing to 
                      do with this. He was long gone 
                        before I went to bed.

                      You gotta understand something, I 
                        loved my husband. He just... wasn t 
                        doing it for me. No ambition, no 
                        fantasies.

                        Yeah. It came with his credit card. 
                        Guess what? I get a whopping 
                        thousand dollars. Now I gotta find 
                        a full-time job and probably sell 
                      the house, too. Some motive for 
                        murder, huh?

  Snow and Vega exchange a look. So much for the wife.


  INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

  Detective BOYD BLOOM, 50s, looks over the Murder Book, 
  filled with photos and reports. He sits behind a cluttered 
  desk in a station that looks like an accountant s office -- 
  metal desks, overflowing file cabinets, unflattering light.

  Boyd, a paper pusher with an ass to match, supervises lower- 
  grade detectives. His desk is his domain, plus the snack 
  room, the only places he goes. He looks up at Snow and Vega.

                        bottle at the crime scene match 
                        prints from a recent series of hot 
                        prowls in the larger valley area. 
                      The intruder looks for unlocked 
                        doors, windows. And... he leaves a

  EXT. L.A. RIVER BASIN - DAY

  Tom and Willie carve walls and grind rails on their boards. 
  Willie has fun, but Tom is tense, working out his 
  aggression. Abruptly, Tom WIPES OUT, taking a bad fall. 
  Willie walks up.

  As Tom ponders that very real question --


  EXT. MULHOLLAND PATIO - SUNSET

  A stunning patio overlooks the Valley below, with the sun 
  fading in an orange sky. FIND Tom and Willie entering the 
  crowded patio. Instead of partyers, they find clusters of 
  tearful BAND MEMBERS, half of them wearing band jackets, 
  talking quietly with hung heads, comforting each other.

  Willie splits off to find the keg. Tom looks around, dazed. 
  Nearby, a girl sobs in the arms of another girl. For the 
  first time, Tom sees the hole he left behind in taking a 
  life.

  He walks to a railing overlooking the city and stares out at 
  the orange sky. Kristi, looking sexy, joins his side.

                      Did you know Mr. Martin sang in 
                        high school choir? Nobody gets it 
                        worse than the choir queers. He 
                        once told me he was the biggest 
                        queer of all. Not gay, just... 
                        different. I think that s why he 
                        became a teacher. Singing in class. 
                        Just to let everyone know it s 
                        okay.

  It finally hits Tom. What he did. The life he ended. He 
  starts to cry. Kristi mistakes his tears for grief.

  She reaches out and puts her arms around him. Tom wraps his 
  arms around her and they hold onto each other.

  Kristi s hands find Tom s face and bring it down to hers. 
  She kisses his cheek. His lips. Emotions yield to hormones, 
  and he kisses her back. As they start to make out in that 
  hungry teenage way --

                        I found two possible suspects. Both 
                      had Martin for science. Both have 
                        juvenile records.

                        Oscar s an ordained minister. Most 
                      of us moonlight. Best part of 
                        making detective. You get regular 
                        shifts.

                                        LUCAS
                      Do you moonlight?

                                        SNOW
                        Yeah. As a mom. So did you contact 
                      the suspects?

  Lucas points to the top photo of a LATINO YOUTH in the 
  folder.

                        I talked to Suarez there. His alibi 
                        doesn t kick in until after 
                        midnight. Do we have an official 
                        time of death?

                                        SNOW
                        Moments away, right Betty?

  REVEAL that they are in a morgue watching the oldest Medical 
  Examiner in L.A. perform an autopsy. DR. BETTY MARION, 70s, 
  stays current on all the latest technology, but she trusts 
  her instincts foremost. She stands over the body of Mr. 
  Martin, his skullcap removed and body split down the front.

                                        DR. MARION
                        Don t rush me.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

  She removes abdominal organs, with the help of an ASSISTANT. 
  Lucas looks over and his face goes slack.

                                        LUCAS
                        I ve never attended an autopsy 
                        before.

                      The first one s the hardest. If you 
                        need to leave...

  But Lucas steps forward, fascinated. Dr. Marion removes the 
  STOMACH and holds it over a container. Using scissors, she 
  cuts open the wall and examines the contents.

                                        DR. MARION
                        Stomach s pretty much emptied out.

                      He was drinking beer. Probably a 
                        lager. Smell those hops?

  She thrusts the stomach at Lucas, who eagerly takes a whiff.

                                        LUCAS
                        Bitter aroma... with a spicy 
                        bouquet.

                                        DR. MARION
                      How much did he have to drink?

                        Four beers. Bartender said he 
                        served the last one around ten.

                        Based on his size? Time of 
                        consumption? Victim died at 1:15 
                        a.m. Give or take five minutes.

                                        LUCAS
                      Is that official?

                                        SNOW
                      Not till we ve had the samples 
                        analyzed, but Betty s never been 
                        wrong. So Suarez here has an alibi 
                        after midnight. What about this 
                        guy? Where was he?

  Snow takes a second photo from the folder. We can t see it.

  EXT. MULHOLLAND PATO - NIGHT

  A miserable Willie sits near the keg with a beer in his 
  hand, cornered by a PLAIN GIRL, who s all smiles and 
  giggles.

                                        PLAIN GIRL

                        horn. You wanna know what that 
                        makes me? Bisectional.

  She laughs like there s nothing funnier. Willie spots Tom 
  filling two beers at the keg and hurries over to him.

                                        WILLIE

                        long to talk to her. We re going 
                      out next weekend.

  Tom eagerly walks off with two beers, leaving Willie 
  hanging.


  ACROSS THE PATIO

  Snow and Lucas enter from the house and look around. The 
  party is rocking now that alcohol is flowing. They pass two 
  DRUNK GIRLS singing to the tune of  My Sharona  by The 
  Knack, while the big-bellied tuba player accompanies them --

                                        DRUNK GIRLS

                        Singing can be very cathartic.

                        Whose party is this?

  The band member points to Kristi sitting alone in a corner. 
  Snow and Lucas watch Tom sit down and hand her a beer. The 
  detectives walk over to the couple, who are talking quietly.

                                        SNOW
                        Excuse me, is this your party?

  Snow shows her LAPD badge. HOLD on Tom s horrified reaction.

  Tom drops his head. Tries to hide his anxiety. Snow takes 
  note of his behavior, while Lucas looks down at his notes.

                                        LUCAS
                      Is there a James Anthony here?

                        Yeah. Right there.

  She points to the beefy tuba player. Tom nearly faints in 
  relief. Snow keeps her eye on him.

                                        SNOW
                      You okay?

                        upset about Mr. Martin s death.

                        Were you in his class?

                      No. I know him from the park. We 
                      ran our dogs together sometimes.

                                        SNOW

                      No. Everybody loved Mr. Martin.

  Snow senses something up with this kid.

                                        SNOW
                        Well, we re conducting interviews 
                      on campus tomorrow. If you hear 
                        anything, stop by.

  Tom nods his head. He will. Snow and Lucas walk way. Kristi 
  slips her arm around Tom and nuzzles him, as Tom watches the 
  detectives start questioning the tuba player.


  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

  The marching band practices on the field, with their 
  DIRECTOR on a high ladder. Tom marches with the 
  percussionists. The band is the picture of synchronicity.                                                                                    48.


  MOMENTS LATER

  Everyone splits apart for a break. As Tom removes his heavy 
  drum, Kristi bounds up to him, cute and flirty.

                                        KRISTI

                        I said I wish I could. My dad only 
                        lets me out on weekends. I can t 
                        wait.

  She kisses him and sashays away. Tom watches her go. Damn, 
  she s sexy. Tom hears his name from a distance. He looks 
  over to the stands to see Willie frantically waving him 
  over.


  THE STANDS - MOMENTS LATER

  CLOSE on a newspaper with a front-page PHOTO of the Martin 
  house. The headline reads: SINGING SCIENTIST MURDERED IN 
  BED.

  Willie and Tom stand over the paper by the stands.

  Abruptly, Willie finds two hands on his chest, driving him 
  under the shadows of the bleachers, where nobody can see.

                                        TOM
                        Residential burglary is a felony, 
                        Willie. You re not talking to them.

                                        WILLIE
                        Yeah, but we could catch a killer, 
                        dude.

  Tom spins Willie to the ground, awkwardly falling on top of 
  him. It s not like Tom knows how to fight, but he knows 
  enough to put a knee on Willie s neck. Willie can t breath. 
  He clutches at Tom, panicking, flailing his arms.

                                        TOM
                        I will not go to jail for you. Do 
                      you understand me?Do you?

  The fear in Willie s eyes says yes. Tom climbs off Willie, 
  leaving him gasping for breath, and starts walking away.

                                        WILLIE
                        What s the matter with you? There s 
                        a psycho out there! There might 
                        even be a reward!

  CLOSE on Tom walking away, realizing Willie is a wild card.


  INT. PRINCIPAL S OFFICE - DAY

  Snow and Vega sit across from an ANGRY GIRL, dripping with 
  teenage pain and angst, reading a poem she wrote.

                                        ANGRY GIRL
                         ...an original thinker in a world 
                      of foreboding. He saved us from our 
                        heads exploding. His spirit shall 
                        always be remembered. Whoever 
                        killed him should be dismembered. 

                                        SNOW
                        Thank you, Pam. That was... 
                        heartfelt. Do you have anything for 
                      us that could actually help our 
                        investigation?

                                        ANGRY GIRL
                      No.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

                        Have you ever heard of The Creeper?

                                        ANGRY GIRL
                      No. He sounds hot.

  The detectives nod appreciatively. She gets up and exits.

                                        VEGA
                        Told you this was a wild goose 
                        chase. Like that tuba player at the 
                        party last night. These kids don t 
                        know anything.

                        Give it a chance, Oscar.

  There s a KNOCK, the door opens, and Willie walks in. He s a 
  little stoned. Snow checks her sign-in list as he sits.

                                          SNOW(cont'd)
                        Hello, Willie. Have a seat. Tell us 
                        what you know.

                                        WILLIE
                        Yeah. Okay. I was at Woodbridge 
                        Park the night of the murder. Not 
                      far from Mr. Martin s house. I saw 
                        a black van. Very suspicious. This 
                        Russian dude behind the wheel.

                                        VEGA
                      How could you tell he was Russian?

                                        WILLIE
                        I don t know. He just looked 
                        Russian.

  Vega and Snow exchange a look.

                                        SNOW
                      Why were you at the park so late on 
                        a Friday night?

                                        WILLIE
                        I was hanging out with a friend.

  SNOW What were you and your friend doing?

                                          WILLIE(cont'd)
                        What s it matter?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                        when you tell me what you were 
                        doing.

                                        WILLIE
                        Hey, whoa, ease off the pedal. I m 
                        here to be helpful.

  Snow coolly downshifts and backs off.

                                        SNOW
                      You sound a little parched there, 
                        Willie. Need some water?

  There are plastic cups and a pitcher of water on the desk. 
  She pours him a cup. Willie picks up the cup to drink.

                                        WILLIE
                      So, do I get any money for this?

                                        VEGA
                        Depends on how good your 
                        information is. You ever heard of 
                      The Creeper?

  Willie freezes up. Unmistakable. Puts down the cup.

                                        WILLIE
                        Look, that s all I got. I need to 
                      go now, before I miss my ride home.

                                        VEGA
                        Keep in touch Willie.

  Willie exits. When he s gone, Snow turns to Vega.

                                        SNOW
                        Little liar. He was a lot closer 
                        than the park.

                                        VEGA
                        I ll bag this for prints and run 
                       em against the partials we found 
                      at the crime scene. Nice move.

  trophy.
  As he zips the trophy into his backpack, a STORE OWNER comes 
  out a back door and starts yelling. Tom jumps onto his 
  skateboard and takes off with his dog running behind.


  INT. APARTMENT - DAY

  Tom walks in the door with his dog and his backpack. He 
  shuts the door and turns to see -- Snow and Vega on the 
  couch with his Mom and Dad, eating birthday cake from paper 
  plates. In the background, the party planner, dressed as 
  Little Bo Peep, plays Duck Duck Goose with Lulu and her 
  princess friends.

                                        DAD
                        Hello, son. Have a seat. These 
                        detectives want to talk to you.

                                        SNOW
                      Hi again.

  Tom nervously smiles and sits, his backpack at his feet.

                                        VEGA
                        Willie Schubert was at Woodbridge 
                        Park with a friend on the night Mr. 
                        Martin was killed. We asked around 
                      and found out you two are pretty 
                        tight.

                                        DAD
                        Tom. Were you at the park with 
                        Willie?

                                        TOM
                        I came straight home after the 
                        game.

                                        MOM
                        I remember that. He went to his 
                        room.

                                        SNOW
                        Willie s your best friend. Has he 
                        told you anything that might help 
                      us?

  Tom looks down, fingering the zipper on his backpack, which
  holds the murder weapon.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    53.

                        It s okay, son. If you know 
                        something, you need to tell the 
                        police.

                                        SNOW
                      You can start by telling us why you 
                        panicked when we showed up at the 
                        party last night.

  Tom, anguished, looks up at his parents.

                                        TOM
                      Is it okay to tell the truth if it 
                        hurts a friend?

                                        MOM
                      Oh, Tommy. You have to tell the 
                        truth.

  Tom reluctantly turns to the detectives.

                                        TOM
                        Willie was in Mr. Martin s house 
                      the night he was murdered. He was 
                        Creeping.

                                        TOM
                        It s like a game. Willie invented 
                      it. He breaks into houses while 
                        people are home. He tried to get me 
                      to try it, but I wouldn t...
                                (overcome by 
                                  emotion)
                        I think Willie killed Mr. Martin.

  Tom breaks down in tears. Whether real or not, we can t be 
  sure, but it doesn t matter. The tears feel real enough to 
  everyone in the room. Off Snow and Vega, closing in on the 
  wrong guy --

  dark shadow creeping into the room, bowling trophy in hand. 
  Tom stops at the bed, staring down at his friend. DIP TO 
  BLACK.


  EXT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MORNING

  The front door opens. Willie s MOTHER answers. REVEAL Snow 
  and Vega, with Lucas and two UNIFORM OFFICERS behind them. 
  Snow presents the woman with a search warrant. DIP TO BLACK.


  INT. TOWNHOUSE - WILLIE S BEDROOM - MORNING

  The detectives search Willie s room. Vega finds a piece of 
  drawing paper in his desk and shows it to Snow -- it s a 
  crude comic book image of The Creeper. DIP TO BLACK. Lucas 
  pulls something from under the bed. As he holds up the 
  bowling trophy, caked in blood --

                                                                  FLARE TO WHITE.


  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - MORNING

  FADE FROM WHITE to Tom marching on field in formation. The 
  band is practicing the Waverly High School VICTORY SONG. Up 
  in the stands, Willie sits on a bleacher playing Gameboy.

  From the field, Tom watches Snow and Vega approach Willie 
  and say something. Tom can t hear what, but from his vantage 
  point he sees two uniform officers closing in from the other 
  side, forming a net around his increasingly agitated friend.

  Suddenly, Willie makes a break for it. Tom watches the cops 
  roughly take down Willie and handcuff him. As Willie is led 
  away, Tom returns his eyes front, playing his victory song 
  with the same impassive expression he had in the teaser.


  INT. POLICE STATION - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

  Willie, face red from crying, sits on one side of the desk 
  next to a LAWYER. Vega sits on the other.

                                        LAWYER
                      My client has nothing to say.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    57.

                                        VEGA
                      You sure? See, if Willie could 
                        clear up a few questions, he might 
                      be able to go home tonight. If 
                        not... he s looking at jail time, 
                        court dates, possible trial.

                                        LAWYER
                        Trying to intimidate a minor? Nice, 
                        detective. I think we re done here.

  Willie can t stand it. He starts tearing up again.

                                        WILLIE
                      No we re not! I didn t do it!


  INT. POLICE STATION - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

  CLOSE on a TV MONITOR with the black-and-white video feed of 
  the Interview Room, looking over Vega s shoulder at Willie.

                                        WILLIE
                        You ve got the wrong --

                                        LAWYER
                        Willie, that s enough.

                                        WILLIE
                      Why can t I tell  em what happened?

  REVEAL Boyd watching the monitor from his desk. Snow stands 
  over him, along with Los Angeles County Assistant District 
  Attorney DONNA RIVERS, 40s, a smart and fair woman.

                                        SNOW
                      I m not so sure this is our guy.

                                        BOYD
                        What re you talking about? We got 
                      his prints and handwriting at the 
                        scene. The murder weapon under his 
                        bed. Best friend s testimony. All 
                        that s missing are the rainbow 
                        sprinkles on top.

                                        SNOW
                      But look at him, Boyd. He wants to 
                        talk to us.

                                        BOYD
                        Hell yeah. He s afraid of jail.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    58.

                      I m normally with you, Angie. But I 
                      can make a strong case with this 
                        evidence. Why not let the courts 
                        decide?

                                        SNOW
                        He s a kid, Donna. I don t wanna 
                      put him through the system if we 
                        don t have to.

                                        BOYD
                        I ll make this easy, detective. 
                        You re shift s over. Go home.

  Off Snow, with no options --


  EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY RACEWAY - DAY

  A vertical light tree counts down. When it reaches green, a 
  tricked out Acura and old-school Mustang GTO both PEEL OUT. 
  A quick-cut SERIES OF RACING IMAGES establish a drag event 
  taking place. Working-class FANS gather in bleachers at the 
  weekly race, which pits novice drag racers against each 
  other for a nominal entrance fee.

  Manny, wearing a race-approved Snell helmet, sits inside his 
  mom s Camaro, waiting for his turn. It s loud. Engines REV. 
  Snow, dressed like a cool biker chick, leans into the window 
  to give her son a pep talk.

                                        SNOW
                        This is what we did for fun when I 
                      was your age. Better than a 
                        videogame, huh?

                                        MANNY
                        Yeah.

                                        SNOW
                      Of course, it wasn t sanctioned 
                        back then. Fact, this is how your 
                      dad got his first misdemeanor. 
                        After he wrapped his super-charged 
                        Nova around a light pole. But 
                        you re gonna do great! Have fun!

  A RACE OFFICIAL waves for Manny to pull forward. Snow slaps 
  the roof of the car and gives her son a holler.                                                                                    59.


  IN THE STANDS

  Snow moves down a bleacher, past some real REDNECK TYPES, 
  until she finds Lucas eating popcorn. She excitedly sits.

                                        SNOW
                        Manny s next!

                                        LUCAS
                      Are you sure this is what you want 
                        your son to get involved with? I 
                      see a lot of questionable 
                        characters in this crowd.

                                        SNOW
                        They just have a different sense of 
                        style. Don t be fooled by the 
                        window dressing.

  Lucas glances at a huge HARLEY GUY next to him with a fuzzy 
  beard and Hell s Angels jacket. Lucas turns back to Snow.

                                        LUCAS
                        Okay.

                                        SNOW
                      If you came to my house, you could 
                        judge me by what you saw, but you d 
                        totally miss who I am.

                                        LUCAS
                        Like a crime scene. Sometimes the 
                        best clues are the ones that aren t 
                        there.

                                        SNOW
                        That s right...
                                  sudden realization)(
                        Like a dog that didn t bark.

                                        LUCAS
                        Excuse me?

  Snow fervently turns to Lucas.

                                        SNOW
                        Mrs. Martin said her husband s 
                        yelling woke her up -- why didn t 
                      the dog wake her? It was in the 
                        house. It barks at everyone.

  They hear the REV OF ENGINES and turn to see Manny s Camaro 
  at the line, next to a custom Civic, chopped down and beefed 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    60.
  CONTINUED:

  up. The Tree counts down. Snow and Lucas cheer from the 
  stands.
  At green, both cars LEAP FORWARD. The Civic gets the jump, 
  but the American muscle of the Camaro kicks in and overtakes 
  the rice burner to win the race.

  In the stands, Snow jumps up and down, clapping and shouting 
  with Lucas. Amid her wild celebration, Snow yells to Lucas 
  --

                                          SNOW(cont'd)
                      Why didn t the dog bark at the 
                        killer?


  INT. KRISTI S BEDROOM - NIGHT

  CLOSE on Kristi sleeping peacefully in a frilly bedroom. PAN 
  OFF her to the window, covered by a lacy curtain. An ominous 
  SHADOW moves outside. The figure slides open the window and 
  pulls back the curtain to reveal Tom.


  BACK ON THE BED

  Tom ENTERS FRAME and sits on the edge of the bed. Tenderly, 
  he reaches out and brushes back Kristi s hair. He bends down 
  and kisses her cheek. Kristi awakes with a start. She sits 
  up, scared, pulling the covers over her body.

                                        KRISTI
                        What s going on?

                        Shhh... it s just me.

                                        KRISTI
                        Tom? Why are you in my bedroom?

                                        TOM
                      You said you wished you could see 
                      me before the weekend. Here I am.

                                        KRISTI
                      You snuck into my house? What s 
                        wrong with you?

                                        TOM
                                  frowns)(
                        Nothing s wrong with me.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    61.

                      Get out of my room, Tom. Now. Go.

  In that instant, Kristi recognizes Tom as a deeply disturbed 
  person, and he knows it. Sadly, he turns to climb out the 
  window. Off Kristi, more than a little freaked out --


  EXT. WOODBRIDGE PARK - DAY

  A terrier joyfully runs across a field. The dog chases a 
  tennis ball, bounds back, and drops it by a pair of feet. 
  TILT UP to a somber Tom. He throws the ball to his dog.

  The terrier sprints away, but this time another dog joins 
  the chase. It s bigger and faster -- the Presa Canario. It 
  beats the smaller terrier and runs the ball back to Tom.

                                        TOM
                      Hey Skipper. How you been doing?

  Tom scratches behind Skipper s ear, just like he likes.

                                        SNOW (O.S.)
                        That dog likes you.

  Tom turns to see Snow and Vega walking up. Across the field, 
  Mrs. Martin calls for Skipper. Snow gives her a wave to say 
  thanks. Snow steps up to Tom. Vega hangs back.

                                        SNOW
                        I had a feeling. Just wanted to 
                        make sure. See, I was wondering why 
                        Skipper there didn t bark at the 
                        killer, then I remembered that you 
                      and Mr. Martin ran your dogs 
                        together.

  She hands Tom a PHOTO. He looks at the crowd picture she 
  took at the crime scene, blown up. It shows the back of Tom 
  walking away from the murder, backpack over his shoulder.

                                          SNOW(cont'd)
                        I printed that up at home. Pretty 
                        good quality, huh? See how you can 
                        make out the skateboard patches on 
                      the backpack.

  Tom looks down at his backpack by his feet. It s the same 
  one in the photo. Tom looks up, across the field, and sees 
  two UNIFORM OFFICERS spread out, just like they did for 
  Willie.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    62.

                      So you want to tell me how it 
                        happened, Tom? Why d you kill Mr. 
                        Martin?

  SLOWLY PUSH IN on Tom. The world closing in. Tighter and 
  tighter. Tom s face appears beyond hope.

                                        TOM
                      He found my backpack.

  The park behind Tom SWIRLS INTO a green chalkboard. We re --


  INT. MR. MARTIN S CLASSROOM - DAY

  Tom stands in front of the chalkboard. PAN to Mr. Martin s 
  desk. Mr. Martin leans against it holding Tom s backpack.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                      You left it in the park.

                                        TOM
                        How d you know whose it was?

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        I checked inside for an ID. I found 
                        something we need to discuss.

                                        TOM
                      The marijuana isn t mine.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        It s not the drugs I m worried 
                        about.

  The teacher pulls out a DIARY. Tom looks up, intensely 
  violated and humiliated, and takes a threatening step 
  forward. His body is coiled, ready to attack.

                                        TOM
                        That s my diary.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                      It reads more like a manifesto. 
                        You re holding a lot of hatred 
                        inside, Tom.

  Mr. Martin flips through pages. We can t see them clearly. 
  We re not meant to. But what we can make out is disturbing. 
  Violent drawings. Pools of blood. Bodies being tortured, 
  abused. It s a peek into a dark and dissociative world.

                        I wouldn t do any of those things 
                      in there. They re just private 
                        thoughts.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                      You know, you re not alone. 
                        Everyone feels different, Tom. When 
                        I was your age, I felt like an 
                        outsider, too.

                                        TOM
                        Give me my diary.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        I ll make you a deal. You agree to 
                        show this diary to a counselor, 
                        I ll throw away the marijuana. If 
                      you don t, I ll turn them both over 
                      to the police.

  Tom stares at him, rocking on his heels, silently seething.

                                        MR. MARTIN(cont'd)
                      Not much we can do right before the 
                        weekend. I ll give you till Monday 
                      to think about it.

                                        TOM (V.O.)
                      But I didn t need the weekend to 
                        think about it. I had to get my 
                        diary...


  INT. MARTIN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Mr. Martin stirs and opens his eyes. Seeing a figure in his 
  room, he sits up with a start -- and recognizes the intruder

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        Tom? Is that you?

  Tom is so close to getting what he came for. He goes for it 
  and snatches the pack, enabling Mr. Martin to grab his arm.

                                        MR. MARTIN(cont'd)
                        What re you doing in my house?

                                        TOM
                      Let go!

  Tom tries to pull away, but the large teacher has him 
  firmly.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    64.
  CONTINUED:

                                        MR. MARTIN
                      No! This has gone too far, Tom! I m 
                        calling the police!

  As Mr. Martin reaches for the phone with his free hand, Tom 
  looks around desperately and spots the bowling trophy on the 
  dresser. Tom picks up the heavy object and SWINGS with all 
  his might, clubbing Mr. Martin on the forehead.

  Mr. Martin falls back on the pillow, stunned, woozy. For a 
  surreal beat he just lies there. Rivulets of BLOOD cascade 
  down his face. He stares up at Tom, confused.

  Tom impulsively raises the bowling trophy and strikes the 
  defenseless teacher AGAIN, and AGAIN, and AGAIN. He stops, 
  looking down at what he did, breathing hard.

                                        TOM (V.O.)
                        I didn t plan to kill him. I just 
                        wanted what was mine....


  INT. POLICE STATION - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

  As we pick up Tom s confession, we find that he s now 
  telling his story to Snow and Vega in the station, with his 
  tearful parents present, along with A.D.A. Rivers.

                                        TOM
                        I couldn t let anyone else see it.

  Snow looks at Rivers, who nods. She s got what she needs.

                                        RIVERS
                        You re doing the right thing, Tom. 
                      The judge will go much easier on 
                      you with a signed confession.

                                        SNOW
                        I need to know... why? Why end a 
                        man s life? When Mr. Martin woke 
                      up, the most you were guilty of was 
                        breaking and entering. They 
                        would ve let you off.

                                        TOM
                      But I wouldn t be invisible 
                        anymore. I like to be invisible.

  As Tom signs his confession, DISSOLVE TO --                                                                                    65.
