                  Hi, I m Gabi Diamond. I m here to 

                  interview for the chef position.

                                      ESMERELDA

                  You have to use the service entrance. 

                  I m sorry. 

      SHE CLOSES THE DOOR ON GABI.


        THERE S A KNOCK AND ESMERELDA OPENS THE DOOR TO FIND GABI.

                                      ESMERELDA

                  This is not the service entrance.

                                    GABI

                  Have a heart. I got on five inch heels.

                                      ESMERELDA

                  I m sorry.

      SHE CLOSES THE DOOR ON GABI.


        THERE S A KNOCK AND ESMERELDA OPENS THE DOOR TO FIND GABI.                                                                                      2.


                                    GABI

                  Is this it? Or is there a shuttle bus 

                  I need to take. 

        ESMERELDA GESTURES HER IN.

                                    GABI (CONT D)

                  Finally. Thank you! (SEES A BATHROOM) 

                  Can I use the bathroom real quick?

                                      ESMERELDA

                  It s for employees only. I m sorry.

      GABI ROLLS HER EYES AND FOLLOWS ESMERELDA.

                                    ELLIOT (O.S.)

                  Hey, there. 

      GABI TURNS TO SEE ELLIOT, A HIGH STRUNG, SHORT, METRO-SEXUAL 
      GUY IN HIS 40 SWALKING A HOITY-TOIDYCHEF TO THE FRONT DOOR. 

                                    ELLIOT (CONT D)

                  I m just finishing up with another 

                  applicant. I ll be right with you.

      GABI STANDS OFF TO THE SIDE, LISTENING TO ELLIOT AND THE CHEF 
        FINISH THEIR CONVERSATION.

                                    ELLIOT (CONT D)

                  (TO CHEF) So you knowGordon Ramsey.                                                                                      3.

                  soon. Possibly on the way to your car. 

      THE CHEF EXITS AND ELLIOT CHUCKLES AS HE TURNS TO GABI.

                                    ELLIOT (CONT D)

                  Well, meeting someone else seems 

                  unnecessary, but you re already here. 

                  You must be Gabi. 

                                    GABI

                  Is that the spice rack? (IT LIGHTS UP 

                  AND SPINS) Or the barber pole in

                  Quiet, El PolloLoco. Gabi, we re not 

                  looking for amateurs. We need someone

        ESMERELDA RUNS OVER TO TAKE HIS BAG.                                                                                      7.

                  China was awe-some! Only problem is 

                  you open a business there and an hour 

                  later you want to open up another one.  

                                    ELLIOT

                  (LAUGHS) I m glad it was a success.

                                    NICK

                  Even my karaoke was a hit. I sang that 

                  song  Daylight  so well they thought I 

                  wasAdam Levine. 

                                    ELLIOT

                  Converting the fifth bedroom into a 

                  karaoke lounge really paid off.

                                    NICK

                  I m exhausted, happy to be home and 

                  starving!

                  source code s corrupt. You gotta zero 

                  out the primary variable and run a

                  she leaves. Which is now, if her car

                                    GABI

                  Go ahead! I m not afraid of a trial. 

                  Cause I m innocent and my food s delish!

      GABI SNORT LAUGHS AGAIN AND HER GUM FLIES OUT OF HER MOUTH. 

                                    GABI (CONT D)

                  Five second rule.

      SHE GRABS HER GUM AND POPS IT BACK IN HER MOUTH.

                                    GABI (CONT D)

                  So what do you want me to make?

                                    NICK

                  Have you ever been proposed to?

                                    GABI

                                    NICK

                  Well, I m proposing to my girlfriend 

                  Friday. We ve only been going out for 

                  four months... But I already know 

                  she s perfect for me. She s cultured, 

                  drop dead gorgeous and I m nevergoing 

                  to do better. I want a dinner that ll

                  put her in the mood to say yes.

                                    GABI

                  Done! I know exactly what girls like 

                  her love to eat.                                                                                      11.


                                    ELLIOT

                  Really? You ve never even met her.

                                    GABI

                  She s an elegant, green-eyed brunette 

                  who s used to the finer things in life. 

                                    ELLIOT

                  How did you--

                                    GABI

                  All part of my superpowers.

                                    GABI

                  Welcome back to  Young and Hungry,  

                  I m Gabi Diamond. These are the 

                  ingredients for pear chutney, which 

                  we re going to start by caramelizing. 

                  First, turn on the broiler, the G-spot

                  of the kitchen. It's hard to find, but 

                  once you do, things get a lot more 

                  fun.

        SOMEONE CLEARS THEIR THROAT AND WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE RE 
      IN... 


      ...A SMALL, CRAPPY KITCHEN. GABI TURNS TO SEE TESSA, 25, A 
      CUTE, BOSSY, CHUBBY BLACK WOMAN, STARING AT HER.

                                    TESSA

                  Are you pretending you have your own 

                  cooking show again?

                                    GABI

                  Not pretending. Practicingfor when it 

                  really happens. One day I m going to 

                  have my own show, cookbooks, a big 

                  house and a husband to curl up and 

                  watch Julia Child with! And I m closer 

                  than ever, because guess what?                                                                                       13.


                                    TESSA

                  You got the job?!

                                     GABI

                  Yes, in an almostykind of way. I got 

                  a trial dinner and if that goes 

                  well... I get the job!

                                    TESSA

                  And Iget a boyfriend!

      THEY HUG AND JUMP UP AND DOWN.

                                    GABI

                  (PULLS AWAY FROM HUG) Wait, what?

                                    TESSA

                  You know a rich eligible bachelor like 

                  Nick Kaminski has party after party 

                  where there s tons of cuties.

                                    GABI

                  He has a big pool party on the books 

                  for next week.

                                    TESSA

                  And we will be there. Locked, loaded 

                  and looking good.

                                    GABI

                  Speaking of loaded, look what he gave me. 

      SHE PULLS OUT A CREDIT CARD.                                                                                      14.


                                    TESSA

                  A Platinum Amex. Damn, we could buy 

                  the whole Mad Men box set. I love me 

                  some Jon Hamm.

                                    GABI

                  That reminds me, I need prosciutto. 

                  He s going to propose to his high 

                  society girlfriend during the meal and 

                  my food has to make her say yes. 

                                    TESSA

                  You re damn right it does! It s going 

                  to be covered in all the magazines. 

                   The Meal That Sealed The Deal.  

                                    GABI

                  (HOLDS UP PEARS) These better be the 

                  best tasting pears in the world. 

      TESSA GRABS A PEAR AND TALKS TO IT.

                                    TESSA

                  Listen here, pear. I m not afraid to 

                  admit it. I ve been going through a 

                  bit of a dry spell. But if you taste 

                  good our lives will change. Our foot 

                  will be in San Francisco s social door 

                  where I will find myself a rich man. 

                                    GABI

                  Or anyman.                                                                                      15.


                                    TESSA

                  Hallelujah! (THEN) I need to buy me 

                  some hair.

                                    GABI

                  You have hair.

                                    TESSA

                  Yes. Everyday-go-to-work-maybe-a- 

                  movie-hair. But not high-class party 

                  hair. That shit sexpensive.

                                    GABI

                  You re starting to give me a panic 

                  attack. The pressure s already 

                  overwhelming. What if I screw this up? 

                                    TESSA

                  You got nothing to worry about. 

                  Remember when we were kids at camp and 

                  I was so hungry I nearly ate a pine 

                  cone. And you raided the mess tent and 

                  using a Bunsen burner, Top Ramen and 

                  ketchup packets, whipped us up a five 

                  star meal. I mean, sure your bunk bed 

                  caught fire and we were banned from 

                  coming back. But you can cook, girl. 

                  You. Can. Cook.                                                                                      16.


                                    GABI

                  You re right. My life might be a hot 

                  mess... but in the kitchen (SNAPS) I 

                  (SNAPS) have it (SNAPS) together.

                                    TESSA

                  You have a gift. And I m going to ride 

                  on your gift s apron strings as far as 

                  they go. 


      GABI LOOKS SOPHISTICATED WEARING A COOL, TIGHT, VINTAGE 
        DRESS, WITH HER HAIR PULLED BACK. SHE S FINISHING WASHING UP 
      WHEN ELLIOT ENTERS WITH TWO GIANT BAGS OF TO-GO FOOD.

                                    GABI

                  What s that?

                                    ELLIOT

                  The back up meal for tonight when you 

                  fall flat on your ass. 

                                    GABI

                  Elliot, with all due respect, check out 

                  my ass. Does it look like it s been 

                  fallen on? No. It s high and tight.

                                    ELLIOT

                  Good, then we have something to focus 

                  on as you re leaving in shame. 

                                    GABI

                  Why do you have such a problem with me?                                                                                      17.


                                    ELLIOT

                  Because I see right through you. You 

                  lack taste and style. You re in way

                  over your head.

      GABI, USING THE REMOTE CONTROL, TURNS ON THE LIGHTS IN THE 
        DINING ROOM TO REVEAL THE TABLE S BEEN FLAWLESSLY SET WITH A 
      COOL FLEA-MARKET FLARE: MIS-MATCHED CHINA, CANDLES IN 
        TERRARIUMS FILLED WITH SUCCULENTS, FRENCH STRIPED LINEN TEA 
        TOWELS AND EXQUISITE FLOWERS. CHAMPAGNE SITS IN A VINTAGE 
      HOTEL SILVER ICE BUCKET NEXT TO SEVERAL DISHES COVERED BY 
        PEWTER CLOCHES.

                                    ELLIOT (CONT D)

                  I can t believe it. You actually, kind 

                  of... pulled it together. 

                                    GABI

                  Yes, I did. I made Cornish game hen 

                  with caramelized pears, truffle 

                  potatoes and a big side dish of bite 

                  me. (SMUGLY) It s what I do.

                                    ELLIOT

                  Well, I ll just put this in the oven to 

                  keep it warm then. Cause when you screw 

                  up - which is inevitable - Nick s going 

                  to realize he made a huge mistake.

        ELLIOT STORMS OFF JUST AS NICK ENTERS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR 
        WEARING A SUIT.

                                    GABI

                  (RUNS OUT) Oh, my god. You look so 

                  handsome!                                                                                      18.


                                    NICK

                  This is my lucky suit. I ve closed 

                  seven huge deals in this. And 

                  hopefully tonight s the eighth. (THEN) 

                  But just to make sure things go my way 

                  I also designed a rabbit s foot app.

      HE TAKES OUT HIS PHONE TO SHOW HER.

                                    GABI

                  You don t need that appwhen you have 

                  this. (MOTIONS TO DINING ROOM) Ta-da!

                                    NICK

                  Wow, it s so intimate and romantic. 

                  Even I want to marry me. And I m 

                  really picky.

                                    GABI

                  And I found the perfect song.

      SHE TURNS ON THE STEREO AND MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYS. 

                                    GABI (CONT D)

                  Whoops. (SOTTO) Esmerelda! (THEN) I 

                  meant this. 

      SHE HITS ANOTHER BUTTON AND TEGANAND SARA S  CLOSER  PLAYS. 
      GABI SINGS ALONG AND DANCES.

                                    GABI (CONT D)

                  (SINGS) All I want to get is, a little 

                  bit closer. All I want to know is, can 

                  you come a little closer?

                                    NICK

                  Teganand Sara! I karaoke this all the time.                                                                                      19.

                  were just having a quiet movie night so 

                  this is going to knock her socks off. If 

                  she wore socks. Which she usually

                  cheered him up. It s kindamy thang.                                                                                      28.

                  Aww, I bet you miss your Mom. That 

                  must be nice. I see mine every day.

                                    GABI

                  Yeah, she was great. She taught me to 

                  cook. We d watch Julia Child together--

                  I loveJulia Child.

                  Really?! 

                                    NICK

                  Yeah, I studied her in a business class. 

                  What an entrepreneur. She took her 

                  passion and turned it into an industry.

                                    GABI

                  She s my inspiration. Whenever I m in 

                  a fix I say,  What would Julia do?  It 

                  became my mantra. (BRIGHTLY) That s 

                  why I dropped out of college.

                                    NICK

                  You re kidding.

                                    GABI

                  Nope, I was miserable. I was studying 

                  economics and hated it, so I asked 

                  myself, what would Julia do? And I 

                  packed up and left to follow my 

                  passion. And here I am!                                                                                      29.

                  Caroline doesn t like me to talk about 

                  it, but yeah. I had to. It was my 

                  Junior year and I asked myself, what 

                  would Julia do?

                                    GABI

                  You did?

                                    NICK

                  (LAUGHS) No. But when you have a dream 

                  you ve got to follow it... especially 

                  when you can t afford your tuition. 

                  Which, oddly, was the impetus for my

                  Wow, we re kind of alike. We both 

                  dropped out of college to follow our 

                  dreams. Except you re in Fortune 500 

                  and to me, 500 isa fortune.  

      THEY BOTH CRACK UP, A LITTLE DRUNK.

                  (HEARTFELT) I m the fortunate one.

                  these rich people won t give me the 

                  time of day. You marrying Caroline is 

                  my ticket to hobnobbing with the elite 

                  class. This is devastating.

                  I know and I hate myself. That s why I

                  I m sorry, Tessa. I should ve never 

                  slept with him. I mean, it was amazing 

                  but it s never going to go anywhere. 

                  He s out of my league. I m like an

                  is a fancy chocolate eclair.

                  A - Twinkiesnever expire. And B - of 

                  course he s out of your league. That s 

                  what makes him good. Who wants someone 

                  in their own league?

                  Two bangs. You said you did it twice. 

                  (THEN) So did he officially fire you? 

                  Cause you could get unemployment.

                                    GABI

                  No, he didn t have to. I was his 

                  rebound sex, Tessa! I peed in his 

                  shoe! I m pretty sure he doesn t want 

                  me around. Elliot already knew my 

                  resum  was B.S. And Esmerelda most 

                  likely told everyone I was in the 

                  closet. Things couldn t be worse. 

                                    TESSA

                  Sure they could. Your car couldabroke 

                  down on the way home, that lady coulda

                  Tweeted about finding you in the closet...

                  (WORRIED) Is it my pink slip?

                  call me if you find my pink slip... 

                  because it s somewhere in his room.

                  job, I just wanna say, you are a  

                  petty, cowardly--

                  (TO GABI) Seriously, I m going to miss

                  (CLAPS) Great  I f dup  speech, Gabi. 

                  But then again, you ve probably had

      HER CHEF KNIVES, THE DOORBELL RINGS AND NICK RACES DOWN THE

        CAROLINE (THINK CAROLYN BESSETTEKENNEDY. STUNNING AND 
        CONFIDENT IN A WAY THAT 12 GENERATIONS OF GOOD BREEDING

                  Caroline. 

                                    CAROLINE

                  Nick. I m so glad you called. I m so 

                  sorry about all this.

                                    NICK

                  You have nothing to be sorry about.                                                                                      41.


                                    CAROLINE

                  Yes, I do. My shrink says I create 

                  drama. (EXPLAINS) He says I m just so 

                  used to getting everything I want that 

                  sometimes I sabotage things to create 

                  a challenge. You understand, right?

                                    NICK

                  Not at all. But that s what I love 

                  about you. You re elusive, mysterious, 

                    complicated... and beautiful. 

                                    CAROLINE

                  Exactly. So you see my problem.

      THEY KISS. AFTER A BEAT SHE PULLS BACK.

                                    CAROLINE (CONT D)

                  There s just one thing I have to get 

                  off my chest. 

                                    NICK

                  I hope it s your bra. 

                                    CAROLINE

                  I slept with someone else.

                  (SHOCKED) Oh, my god!

      WE SEE GABI BEHIND THE COUNTERS MOUTHING  OH MY GOD  TOO.

                                    CAROLINE

                  I saidI sabotage. (THEN) It was a 

                  terrible mistake. If I could take it 

                  back I would. Do you hate me?                                                                                      42.


                                    NICK

                  Not as much as I hate myself. (THEN) 

                  Because... I slept with someone, too. 

      GABI GASPS.

                                    CAROLINE

                  Really?!

                                    NICK

                  It was stupid, it meant nothing! Can 

                  you forgive me?

                                    CAROLINE

                  Yes... I can. In fact, in an odd way, 

                  it kind of turns me on.

                                    NICK

                  Really? Does that mean we can move on? 

                  Because I love you, Caroline. (PULLS 

                  RING FROM HIS POCKET) And I want to 

                  marry you.

                                    CAROLINE

                  Oh, Nick.

                                    NICK

                  Is that a yes?

                                    CAROLINE

                  Yes! It s beautiful. 

      THEY START KISSING AGAIN. 

                                    CAROLINE (CONT D)

                  Though I ll have to watch you like a 

                  hawk.                                                                                      43.

                  I m not going to let you out of my 

                  sight.

      THEY START MAKING OUT AGAIN. GABI SHAKES HER HEAD. CAROLINE 
      PUTS THE RING ON AND LOOKS AT IT.

                                    CAROLINE

                  I m going to be Caroline Rukeyser

                  Huntington Kaminski... IfI go through 

                  with this. (THEN) I m calling mother. 

                  And my shrink.

      SHE RUNS OFF AND GABI QUICKLY TRIES TO CRAWL OUT THE BACK OF 
      THE KITCHEN WITH HER KNIVES WHEN NICK ENTERS.

                  I was just getting my knives. (GETS UP) 

                    Congratulations, Nick. I overheard. 

                                    NICK

                  I feel horrible about all of this. 

                                    GABI

                  Me too. I was so excited to have this 

                  job and then felt awful when Caroline 

                  broke up with you and then got super 

                  drunk trying to make you feel better. 

                  I didn t mean for us...                                                                                       44.


                                    NICK

                  Neither did I! (THEN) But you helped 

                  me get through the worst moment of my 

                  life. (THEN) I didn t mean to make 

                  things so difficult.

                                    GABI

                  Well, you did. Because this was my 

                  dream job. I was going be your chef 

                  for a really long time and eventually 

                  write a series of books, with your 

                  approval, called  Cooking For Mr. 

                  Kaminski . And then buy a big house 

                  and... well... It doesn t matter. I 

                  have to start all over again. 

                                    NICK

                  But I m not firing you. (JOKING) My 

                  lawyers told me I couldn t.

                  situation. You re engaged to your fianc e 

                  while I m in the kitchen. I wanted to 

                  make tarts not be one.

                  Can t we just go back to how it was? 

                  We don t have to tell anyone what 

                  happened.                                                                                      45.

                  She d never pass up a huge opportunity
