      OVERHEAD VIEW of a dark, hilly, tree-lined road in Northern 
      Virginia, fifteen or twenty minutes outside the nation s 
      capital.  A SPEEDING CAR approaches.  

      SQUEALING BRAKES as the car takes a hairpin curve at 50 MPH, 
      leaving a trail of burnt rubber behind it.  But it keeps the 
      road.  


      A SQUASHED RACCOON, bisected by tire treads, lies on the 
      edge of the asphalt several hundred yards away.  The tip of 
      a CRUTCH stabs down, plants itself in the steaming innards.  

      The crutch belongs to a MOONLIT FIGURE who s just shambled 
      out of the woods.  He s moving slowly and with extreme 
      difficulty: one leg, obviously shattered, dangles uselessly 
      from his hip.  His left arm is missing altogether. 

      He seems to be wearing some sort of military uniform. 

      We can t see his face, because it s dark out, and because 
      his back is to us as he makes his way along the gravelly 
      shoulder of the road.  DISTANT HEADLIGHTS come into view 
      just as he passes a SIGN that reads:  

      WASHINGTON, D.C.  19  


      As the car speeds toward the man on crutches, HEADLIGHTS 
      catch him full in the face.  In the instant before he throws 
      his one good hand up to shield his eyes from the glare, we 
      get a quick glimpse of the burned, puckered skin that covers 
      half of his almost-hairless skull.  


      -- and the car, at full speed, PLOWS DIRECTLY INTO the man 
      on crutches.  It s as if he s held together by pins and 
      baling wire: an arm hurtles off in one direction, a leg in 
      another.   

      The crutch flies upward, end over end ...  


      -- slamming into a TREE at the edge of the woods.  




                                                3.  




      David is slumped over the wheel, stunned. He comes around 
      slowly, wincing, as the airbags deflate (assuming we can 
      afford airbags). He glances over at Jane -- who's badly 
      rattled, and sporting a cut on her forehead, but otherwise 
      instact.  

                                      DAVID  
                        You all right?  

                                      JANE  
                        I hit my h--  

      Before she can finish the sentence she glances at the 
      cracked windshield -- and lets out a piercing SHRIEK.  

      They have company.  The HEAD of the man on crutches seems to 
      have landed in the groove between the hood of the car and 
      the windshield.  In fact it s stuck there, practically face-
      to-face with Jane.  She squirms in her seat, SHRIEKS AGAIN, 
      pulls her legs up in front of her.  

      Then the head OPENS ITS EYES.  Stares at her.  Seems to 
      recognize her.  The mouth opens, as if to say hello.  

      She begins POUNDING HYSTERICALLY on the dashboard. David 
      turns on the windshield wipers -- dislodging the head, which 
      rolls off the hood and bounces off into the trees.  

      He grabs her by the arm to let her know that the head is 
      gone, and it's okay to stop screaming.  

                                      JANE   
                        Sorry.  I, uh ...  
                                (sheepishly)  
                        I think I knew him once. Where 
                        are we?  

      David opens the door and climbs out.  


      As Jane gets out of the passenger side, wiping blood from 
      the cut on her forehead, she sees David leaning against the 
      car, clutching his side in obvious pain.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Jesus ... I think I broke a 
                        rib...  



                                                4.  



                                      JANE  
                        Suck it up. We've got to get out 
                        of here.  

      Their heads turn at the sight of the DISTANT HEADLIGHTS 
      rounding a bend, approaching on the straightaway. Jane pulls 
      off her heels and scampers, barefoot, to the edge of the 
      road.  

                                      JANE   
                        Honk the horn! Maybe they'll 
                        give us a ride.  

      She stands directly in the path of the oncoming headlights, 
      waving her shoes as if they were semaphore flags. The 
      vehicle slows and stops. It's big -- a truck of some sort.  

      CLOSEUP -- ON JANE  

      The headlights are shining right in her face; she holds up 
      one hand to shield her eyes. A truck door opens O.S. All at 
      once her face is full of apprehension...  

                                      JANE   
                        David...  

      Now she turns and runs, in a full-fledged panic.  

                                      JANE   
                        David! Jesus! Pop the trunk!  


      It appears to be a canvas-topped army troop transport.  And 
      it s carrying a load of passengers, several of whom have 
      already climbed out.  

      We can t see them well; they re still a good ways off.  But 
      there s enough moonlight to make out the occasional missing 
      arm or leg.  Some of them can t even walk without the help 
      of their comrades.  

      They re all wearing raggedy, tattered UNIFORMS.  


      Jane rips a swath of cloth from her already-short skirt and 
      ties it around her bloody forehead bandanna-style.  From the 
      trunk of the car she pulls out a double-barreled shotgun and 
      a box of shells.  

      Wheezing, David stumbles to her side.  

                                                5.  


                                      JANE  
                        There s an automatic in the 
                        trunk.  

                                      DAVID  
                        What s the point, Jane?  

                                      JANE  
                        The point is, we are not giving 
                        up.  And we are definitely not 
                        giving up to a bunch of 
                        crippled, stinking, maggot-
                        infested, brain-dead zombie 
                          dissidents.  
                              (to the truck)  
                        COME AND GET IT!  COME AND GET 
                        IT, YOU PUSSIES!  

      She fires a shotgun blast into the air, then reloads.  

                                      DAVID  
                        What are we going to do?  

                                      JANE  
                        We re going to take their goddam 
                        truck right out from under them, 
                        that s what.  Now grab that gun, 
                        you chickenshit.  

      One of the fellows from the troop transport is tramping 
      slowly but steadily toward them.  With a feral gleam in her 
      eye, Jane lowers the shotgun slightly and fires.  Both 
      barrels.  

      The twin blasts knock the legs out from under this  zombie 
      dissident.   He hits the road HOWLING IN PAIN   and his 
      weird keening plaint is picked up by his comrades, one by 
      one, until the entire company is CATERWAULING in harmony.  

                                      JANE   
                        That s the trick, see ... aim 
                        low, take their legs out ... 
                        can t kill  em, but you can slow 
                         em up ...  
                              (firing again)  
                        GET UP, YOU PANSIES!  BRING IT 
                        ON!  

      David smiles ruefully at Jane, who is, in some bizarre way, 
      thoroughly in her element.  As she blasts away, he hobbles 
      to the trunk of the car and comes back with a .38.  



                                                6.  



                                      DAVID  
                        I m sorry, Jane.  I m truly 
                        sorry.  

                                      JANE  
                        Who cares?!  Shut up and shoot!  

                                      DAVID  
                        It s my fault, you know.  The 
                        whole damned mess. It s all my 
                        fault.  

      The undead troops are still advancing   no more than ten or 
      fifteen feet away now.  Jane can t reload fast enough to 
      hold them off.  

                                      JANE  
                        Holy Mother of Hip-Hop Jesus ...  

                                      DAVID  
                        I m sorry, Jane.  I never 
                        should ve opened my mouth.  

      He levels his gun at the back of her head and squeezes the 
      trigger.  SCREEN GOES BLACK.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        I remember the night the whole 
                        world went to hell.  It was the 
                        night I first met Jane.  

      SUPER TITLE:  Four weeks earlier   

      FADE THROUGH TO:  


      David's car drives through ornamental gates, entering a 
      hillside cemetery in a D.C. suburb.  


      David pulls over to the shoulder of the gravel road just 
      above a spreading chestnut tree.  He fetches his mom's 
      aluminum walker from the trunk, then opens her door and 
      helps her out. 

                                      MOM  
                        Patty Ranahan s boy came by to 
                        see her last night ...  

      She keeps talking as David reaches into the back seat for 
      the flowers and the chocolate.  



                                                22.  



                                      MOM   
                        He was standing outside the 
                        window.  In the moonlight, she 
                        said.  And she went out on the 
                        patio.  He just wanted to tell 
                        her goodbye.  

      David hasn't been listening very closely, and it's only now 
      that the penny drops:  

                                      DAVID  
                        Patty Ranahan.  
                              (pause)  
                        Isn t she the one ... wasn t her 
                        son killed in the war?  

                                      MOM  
                        Yes, that s him.  -- I thought 
                        it was odd when she told me.  

                                      DAVID  
                                (snorting)  
                        Well, what?  Is she off her 
                        meds?  

                                      MOM  
                        I don t know, honey.  Maybe I 
                        just got the details wrong.  

      Concerned, David helps his mom negotiate a hillside path 
      that leads to a gravesite with a MILITARY HEADSTONE:  

                              LANCE CPL. PHILIP W. MURCH 
                              May 6, 1951 - Oct. 22, 1971 
                                Beloved Son and Brother 

      Mom places the flowers in a small urn at the head of the 
      grave and adjusts them to her liking.  Then she sets a 
      single chocolate truffle at the base of the urn.  

                                      MOM   
                        He liked chocolates.  

                                      DAVID  
                        You re making some little 
                        squirrel very happy.  

      David helps Mom to her feet.  He gives her a truffle from 
      the box and has one himself.  As the two of them stare 
      wistfully at the grave his cell phone rings again.  Twice.  

                                      MOM  

                                                23.  


                        Oh, go on.  You can answer it.  

                                      DAVID  
                        No.  It s just my ... it s a 
                        woman I ve been seeing.  On and 
                        off.  

                                      MOM  
                        Oh.  Have I heard about this 
                        one?  

                                      DAVID  
                        Actually, it s Jane Cleaver.  

                                      MOM  
                        From TV??  Oh, you be careful, 
                        hon.  She s what we used to call 
                        a skank.  

      They walk up a gently sloping hill to the car, which is 
      parked on a gravel access road that snakes through the 
      cemetery.  As David is helping his mom into the front seat, 
      something peculiar catches his eye.  

      He squints off into the distance.  Downhill, maybe a hundred 
      yards away, a FIGURE is hunched over a grave, flinging dirt 
      clods into the air.  It s almost sunset and the light is 
      bad, but he's plainly not an employee of the cemetery.  For 
      one thing, he doesn t have a shovel.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Hey, mom?  Wait here a minute.  

      A drunk?  A fraternity prankster?  David starts down the 
      hillside to get a closer look.  

                                      DAVID   
                        Hey!  Buddy!  What the hell are 
                        you doing?  

      The hunched figure turns to stare at David.  There s not 
      much skin covering his skull.  It's a UNIFORMED CORPSE.  

      And all at once, the corpse is up on its feet, coming right 
      at David.  For an agonizingly long moment David finds 
      himself rooted to the ground.  Finally he turns ...  

      ... just in time to see a SECOND FIGURE coming over the 
      crest of the hill, working its way down toward the car.  
      Toward David s mom.  He sprints up the hill shouting:  

                                      DAVID   
                        MOM!!  LOCK THE DOORS!!  

                                                24.  


      Uniformed Corpse #2 has a game leg.  Just as Mom is leaning 
      over to lock the driver s side door, the creature loses its 
      balance.  He hops downhill, picks up speed, and SPLAYS 
      HIMSELF across the hood of David s car.  

      As David slides in on the driver s side, Mom lets out a 
      nice, full-throated SCREAM.  The thing on the windshield 
      matches it with one of the plaintive, unearthly WAILS we ve 
      heard before.  David gets the engine running with Corpse #2 
      still clinging to the hood.  

      He hits the gas; Corpse #2 slides off onto the gravel.  But 
      now Corpse #1 has arrived to block the road; and as David 
      slows, trying to weave around him --  

      -- Corpse #2 sticks his arm through the partially-open 
      window and GRABS DAVID around the throat!  

      Gasping, David raises the electric window until the corpse's 
      arm is pinned between the door frame and the glass.  He 
      pulls the creature's hand away from his throat and, by 
      leaning over as far as he can to the right, manages to stay 
      out of its grasp as he drives.  He floors the pedal again.  

      As they speed toward the cemetery gates, the hand continues 
      to open and close, groping at David.  Mom points out the 
      window and SCREAMS AGAIN ...  

      ... because they seem to have left Corpse #2 behind some 
      time ago.  Now there's just a SEVERED ARM dangling from the 
      window -- detached from its owner, but still, apparently, 
      alive!  


      David lowers the window just enough for the detached arm to 
      fall out onto the road.  The two Uniformed Corpses come 
      shambling into view just as David s taillights vanish 
      through the cemetery gates.  


      A ZOMBIE SOLDIER stumbles down the street in a TORRENTIAL 
      DOWNPOUR.  The OWNER of a small mom-&-pop lunch counter, 
      sweeping out the entry to his store, watches him pass.  

                                      MR. BAKER  
                        Son ... ?  Son?  

      The rain-soaked zombie stops in his tracks and gapes at Mr. 
      Baker.  He s not used to being addressed by the living.  

                                      BAKER (CONT.)  
                        You ought not to be out in that 
                        rain.  






                                                38.  




      Post-funeral.  Mrs. Murch stares down at her elder son's 
      fresh grave, with young David at her side.  



                                                52.  



                                      DAVID  
                        You ll see, Momma.  I m gonna 
                        wish.  I m gonna wish for Philip 
                        to come back and be okay, and 
                        he ll tell you.  We were just 
                        playing a game and he ll be 
                        okay.  

                                      MOM  
                        I know, baby.  

                                      DAVID  
                        That s gonna be my wish every 
                        day till he comes back.  

      Mom pulls him close and holds him tight.  

                                      MOM  
                        You re a good boy, David.  

                                      DAVID  
                        It was just a game ...  


      CITIZENS arriving, standing on line to vote, with ZOMBIE 
      SOLDIERS waiting their turn like anyone else.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        But they voted.  I saw to that.  
                        I went in to POTUS and I gave 
                        him the sales pitch of my life 
                        ... and on election day, by God, 
                        they voted.  

      VARIOUS SHOTS of ZOMBIE HANDS as they punch cards, pulling 
      levers.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        And when they d made their 
                        point, and their voices were 
                        heard ... they were finally at 
                        peace.  

      VOTERS look on as ZOMBIE SOLDIERS emerge from voting booths 
      and topple lifelessly to the ground.  


        Confetti-covered REVELERS in party hats wander out of a 
      hotel ballroom onto the streets of downtown D.C.  Among them 
      are David and Jane   both half-smashed and giggly as they 
      make out at a bus stop.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Six weeks in Bora Bora.  That s 
                        what we need.  That ll fix us 
                        right up.  

                                      JANE  
                        I can t, David.  I have to ramp 
                        up.  Kathy wants me on the team!  

                                      DAVID  
                        Really.  Her old job?  

                                      JANE  
                        No, you dumb shit.  Yours!  

      David manages to conceal his surprise   just barely.  

                                      JANE (CONT.)  
                        She told me you were packing it 
                        in.  But can still be my mentor 
                        and spiritual adviser.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Jane!  You re so good to m   

      AN AWFUL, GHOSTLY KEENING NOISE FILLS THE AIR.  

      It s everywhere.  It s unavoidable.  PASSERSBY cover their 
      ears.  Jane and David do likewise.  


      Row upon row of white military markers.  




                                                56.  




      TIGHT ON a military headstone.  A SKELETAL HAND bursts 
      through the sod before it.  Six feet away, another.  And 
      then a third ...  


      Up and down the street, PEDESTRIANS are reeling from the 
      omnipresent KEENING.  Jane is trying, with some difficulty, 
      to carry on a cell-phone conversation ...  

                                      JANE  
                        Kathy!  What is it?  What s 
                        happening?  


      The KEENING CONTINUES as Jane flips the phone shut and 
      shouts in David s ear.  

                                      JANE  
                        They re coming out of Arlington.  
                        All of  em.  World War II.  
                        Korea.  Vietnam ...  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        We said we'd count their votes, 
                        but we didn't.  We lied.  What 
                        were they going to do?  -- Well, 
                        they did what soldiers always 
                        do.  They called for 
                          reinforcements.  

      CUT TO:  


      A deserted country road outside Washington, where a FIGURE 
      ON CRUTCHES is silhouetted by the headlights of an oncoming 
      car.   

                                                57.  


      The car SWERVES suddenly and PLOWS RIGHT INTO HIM.  

      A HORN BLARES.  A TROOP TRANSPORT rumbles into frame.  The 
      car veers off the road, crashes through a barrier, and slams 
      into a tree.  


      Beside the wrecked car, with dead soldiers advancing on 
      them.   

      Jane aims her shotgun at the zombies while David reaches in 
      the trunk for an automatic.  

                                      JANE  
                        Get up, you pansies!  BRING IT 
                        ON!  

                                      DAVID  
                        I m sorry, Jane.  I never should 
                        have opened my mouth.  

      With that, he shoots her in the back of the head.  The 
      zombies keep on coming   so he lifts the gun to his temple, 
      closes his eyes, and pulls the trigger.  

      Click.  Empty clip.  

                                      DAVID   
                        Oh, shit.  

      And now the zombies are all around him.  But instead of 
      attacking, they MURMUR among themselves   examining David as 
      if he s some kind of exotic specimen.  One of them (with 
      working vocal cords) steps to the front of the group.  

                                      CAPT. ZOMBIE  
                        You re the one who called us 
                        back.  

                                      DAVID  
                        That s right.  

                                      CAPT. ZOMBIE  
                        You said we d have a voice.  But 
                        you betrayed us.  

                                      DAVID  
                        That s right.  I ve got it 
                        coming, okay?  And I m not 
                        afraid.  So go on.  Do what 
                        you re going to do!  


                                                58.  


      A long silence. Capt. Zombie smiles, admiring David s grit.  

                                      CAPT. ZOMBIE  
                        Help us.  

                                      DAVID  
                        How?  

                                      CAPT. ZOMBIE  
                        Join us.  We re looking for a 
                        few good men.  

      Now David spies an old corpse moving through the crowd.  
      It s little more than a skeleton, in tattered rags, with 
      bits of leathery skin clinging here and there.  With two 
      bony fingers it flashes him a PEACE SIGN.  

                                      SKELETON  
                        Hiya, squirt.  Long time no see.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Philip?!?  

                                      SKELETON  
                        You did your best, little 
                        brother.  I d be proud to fight 
                        beside you.  

      In a tender, brotherly gesture, Skeletal Philip claps his 
      claws on either side of David s head   and TWISTS it 
      suddenly, neatly snapping his brother s neck.

                        remind you, if you forget, that
