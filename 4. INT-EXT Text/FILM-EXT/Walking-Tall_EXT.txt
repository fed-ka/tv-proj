He walks through a town, passing various stores and the general
bustle of the people there. He notices a baby in a pram left
out on the sidewalk, then sees the mother is in an alleyway doing
what looks like a drug deal.
Chris reads a closure notice on the door. A police car rolls
up.
SHERIFF WATKINS
How ya doin'?
CHRIS
Ok. When'd the mill close?
SHERIFF WATKINS
Ahh 3 years this August. If ya lookin
for work you might wanna try Aberdeen,
that's the closest mill work you're
gonna find around here.
CHRIS
That's too bad.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Nah just simple economics. Y'know we
have a really nice casino here, the
wild cherry. You wanna make some money
maybe you wanna go on down there and
try your luck at the blackjack tables.
CHRIS
Nah I don't think so. Thanks.
Chris turns around and the sheriff notices his name on a bag.
SHERIFF WATKINS
You're Chris Vaughn?
The sheriff chuckles and steps out of the car.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Well hell, I know all about you Chris.
I know your folks, I'm sheriff Stan
Watkins.
They shake hands.
CHRIS
How ya doin.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Ralston get outta the car, you're lookin
at a real soldier here pay some respect.
RALSTON
Welcome home soldier.
CHRIS
Thanks.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Here Chris, (opens the back door) We'll
give ya a ride up to your folks.
CHRIS
Nah I'm fine thank you.
SHERIFF WATKINS
I insist.
CHRIS
I'll walk.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Hey it's my pleasure.
CHRIS
It's ok.
SHERIFF WATKINS
I won't take no for an answer (jokingly
reaches for his gun). HEY! Get in the
car.
Chris raises his hands and the sheriff chuckles.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Did I scare ya with that one?
CHRIS
Lil bit.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Ya. Let's go.
CHRIS
Thanks for the ride.
SHERIFF WATKINS
No problem, and uh Chris (hands him
a piece of paper). It's election month...
I'm your man.
Chris takes the paper and smiles. He walks up the lane toward
the house, a simple white building clad in wood. A lady dressed
in a police uniform comes out.
MICHELLE
Can I help you?
Chris laughs.
MICHELLE
Lil' brother.. You come over here and
gimme a hug.
They laugh together.
MICHELLE
You look great.
CHRIS
What is this?
MICHELLE
Hey, I couldn't let you be the only
one looking good in uniform. Hey ma!
Chris is here!
CHRIS
What's with the tent? (points to a tent
set up on the lawn).
MICHELLE
Oh, that's for Pete.
CONNIE
Look at you!
CHRIS
How ya doin!
Chris hugs his mother, Connie. A man slowly emerges from the
front door.
CONNIE
How long do we have ya for?
CHRIS
For good. I'm home.
CONNIE
Really? You're not kiddin.
CHRIS
No.
They hug again.
CHRIS
Hey dad.
DAD
Welcome back.
A crappy camper van rolls up. A man steps out.
CHRIS
Ray Ray! Ahaaa.
RAY
Hello puddin'.
They hug.
CHRIS
How ya doin?
RAY
I'm alright.
CHRIS
What is that? (points to the van)
RAY
That's the lovemachine.
CHRIS
Girls actually get in there?
Ray shrugs.
CHRIS
How ya been?
RAY
Good. Clean livin.
CHRIS
Wanna beer?
RAY
No. Believe it or not I quit drinkin.
I'll take a soda though.
CHRIS
Here.
RAY
Thanks man.
CHRIS
Whoah. (spots a tattoo of a guitar on
Ray's arm).
RAY
Ya like that? When you left town it
gave me the idea that I should do something
with my life too so uhh I went down
to Seattle, got a guitar and became
all about music. And then pretty soon
I was about music and drugs, n pretty
soon I was basically just about drugs.
Ended up doin 2 years for B+E.
CHRIS
I'm sorry.
RAY
Nahh, look at me now though right? I
been clean and sober for 14 months,
doing construction and renewing those
supportive and healthy friendships from
my past. Matter of fact I talked to
the bastards, told em you were back
and they asked me to politely remind
you that kick off's in twenty minutes.
A group of guys are there waiting, one of them holding a ball.
They salute as Chris walks up. They all laugh.
CHRIS
Playin ball?
ALL
Let's play ball!
JIMMY
Ray go deep go deep! (as Ray runs off
he throws the ball into Ray's back).
CHRIS
(Spotting a sign that reads 'HAMILTON
FIELD') When did that happen?
JIMMY
His parents hadn't left him the mill
more than 2 minutes before he shut it
down.
CHRIS
Why?
a voice shouts 'HEADS UP' Chris catches a fast ball thrown from
behind. Jay steps out of his vehicle.
JAY
Cause I opened my Casino.
CHRIS
Still got a gut huh Jay?
JAY
Still got your reflexes. What, you get
tired of being all that you can be?
CHRIS
I'm still all I can be.
JAY
Really? I'll just have to see about
that. What brings you home?
CHRIS
I just wanna relax, catch my breath.
JAY
You? Relax?
Another truck with a few guys on it pulls up
JAY
Not today.
A football game ensues, there are two teams. Jay's guys vs Chris'
guys. On the sidelines Pete pulls up on a small motorcycle. Chris
notices Pete hanging around with kids smoking. It comes down
to the last play, the teams are huddled into two groups talking.
RAY
If we score here we win right?
CHRIS
Alright boys, last play. We need to
put this to rest.
RAY
Just give me the ball.
CHRIS
You got it. On the first hut!
JAY
Ok Vaughn, last chance.
Chris gets the ball and throws it. An opponent comes in hard
and tackles him low. He collapses. Ray runs for the ball but
gets clotheslined by Jay.
JAY
That's game!
OPPONENT
(to Chris) Sorry about that.
CHRIS
That's cool man.
Chris Helps Ray onto his feet.
JAY
Welcome home.
CHRIS
Good to be back.
JAY
See ya round. Hey, if you're not doing
anythin later on you could come by the
casino. I'll introduce ya to some nice
girls, drinks are on me. Whaddya say?
CHRIS
See ya tonight.
JAY
Cool.
Jay speeds off in his car. Pete rolls up on his bike.
PETE
Hey Sarge, good game. Maybe next time.
CHRIS
Hold up. Maybe next time I won't see
you with the bleachers smoking weed.
RAY
Welcome home buddy.
CHRIS
Don't you have to be native american
to own a casino?
JIMMY
Oh Hamilton's one sixteenth black man
now.
FRIEND 2
Just so you guys know, I'm gonna triple
my money tonight.
FRIEND 3
Yea, like last time. Wound up selling
your body for bus fare.
FRIEND 4
He had to walk!
They all laugh.
CHRIS
Nobody's gonna have any problems finding
this place.
RAY
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics
that I find most impressive, blends
in with the mountains SO nicely.
We see Chris is crawling, badly hurt. A truck stops directly
in front of him. Chris passes out again.
Chris has returned home. He's still in bad shape and his parents
help him out of the car. He insists on taking the steps by himself.
PETE
There's some old crutches in the garage.
Chris laughs.
Jay pulls up in his car.
JAY
Hey. First of all I wanna say thanks.
CHRIS
For what?
JAY
He's been fired, and his gaming permit's
been pulled. I don't know how my security
cameras didn't catch that.
Jay starts to help Chris taking wood off the truck but Chris
throws it back on.
CHRIS
They miss a lot at your place don't
they Jay.
JAY
Look Chris I hate seein ya like this.
CHRIS
Your boys did it.
JAY
Wait wait... so they got a little rough,
they were a bit edgy. Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes
they have to put up with on a daily
basis. Look, they've been reprimanded.
They say you went nuts man. I'm sorry.
I know the proper term vets use is post
traumatic stress.
CHRIS
What the fuck are you talking about?
JAY
Whatever it was, you tore my place apart
and it wasn't easy for me to get my
guys agree not to press charges. Look
Chris, if you had a problem... shouldn't
you have come to me? Look, I wanna bring
you inside. Chris I wanna make you head
of security. Whaddya say?
CHRIS
No.
JAY
Ah well. I guess you probably need time
to think about it. This is for you.
It's a little something to help you
get... Y'know..
He puts down an envelope with money in it. Chris gives it back
to him.
JAY
Come on man, don't be like that. I came
all the way out here to your house just
to see you get back on your feet.
CHRIS
I'm goin to the sheriff.
JAY
I'm sorry you feel that way. I'll see
ya round Chris.
DENI
How you been?
CHRIS
Been better.
DENI
Talked to the sheriff yet?
CHRIS
Well I went down to the police station
and I talked to somebody with a badge.
Sure as hell didn't seem like much of
a sheriff.
DENI
He's up for re-election you know. Maybe
you could take his job.
CHRIS
Somebody ought to. How about you?
DENI
Sunshine and pine trees. Been readin
these books, teach you how to cultivate
happiness. Books on the future, go with
the flow, that sorta thing.
CHRIS
Is it workin?
DENI
I have my moments.
CHRIS
So the casino huh?
DENI
Yep. Been there almost a year.
CHRIS
Treatin you good?
DENI
Lot better than it treated you.
CHRIS
I like that. Jay Hamilton's done well
for himself hasn't he.
DENI
Yea, he's a real go-getter that one.
CHRIS
Must be. I heard he got you.
DENI
Lasted about 8 minutes, a long long
time ago.
CHRIS
You still work for him though.
DENI
Rent's gotta be paid Chris.
CHRIS
Suppose so.
DENI
Hope to see you around.
CHRIS
Do you?
She begins to drive off.
CHRIS
Thanks for the jacket.
She toots the horn as she goes.
The Vaughn's truck pulls up at speed. They enter a garage, Pete
is on a stretcher.
MICHELLE
It's ok mom he's stabilised. (To Chris)
It was close. Crystal Meth.
PETE
I'm sorry. I never did it before.
KID
It's true. We mighta kinda pushed him
into it.
Chris approaches the kid.
CHRIS
Where'd you get the drugs?
KID
I'm not really sure...
CHRIS
Stop. Where?
KID
From the security guys workin at the
casino.
Chris gets into his truck.
CONNIE
Chris, wait. Call the police.
CHRIS
No, that won't do any good.
Chris speeds off. He pulls up at their home and enters the garage.
DAD
Is Pete ok?
CHRIS
He'll be fine.
Chris is searching about and forces open a cupboard.
DAD
What are you doin?
Chris pulls out a shotgun and loads it.
DAD
Aw Chris not like this. Chris listen
to me. If you go outta here with that
gun, they're gonna.. ne... Chris!
Chris drives to the casino, he cocks the shotgun but decides
to leave it in the truck. Instead he takes a piece of wood from
the back of his truck. He enters the casino with it. He smashes
a fruit machine. A guard comes up and Chris beats him. A fight
scene breaks out with Chris beating the guards and generally
trashing the place. He takes back his special forces dogtag from
the guard who stole it. Chris hurls his piece of wood at the
VIP lounge window, smashing it to pieces. Jay emerges from behind
it.
JAY
Guess that changes our relationship
a bit huh?
Chris leaves. As he drives off in his truck, police cars appear
with sirens going. He pulls over.
SHERIFF WATKINS
You should NOT have come looking for
trouble. Keep your hands up, get out
of the vehicle now Chris! NOW!
Chris pulls up to the station in his police truck, it's clear
he's now the sheriff.
WATKINS
Sheriff.
CHRIS
Watkins.
WATKINS
Well you won the election, congratulations.
We do have a tradition of professional
courtesy up here, and I can personally
vouch for each and every one of these
men. They're good deputies.
CHRIS
You're all fired.
Jay is speeding along in a sportscar. He is pulled over by a
police truck.
JAY
Hey Chris.
CHRIS
License and registration please.
JAY
You're joking right?
CHRIS
License and registration.
Jay hands it over.
JAY
What's the problem sheriff?
CHRIS
You. And the drugs you're pedalling
out of your casino.
JAY
Oh. Only thing that's going on in my
casino right now is reconstruction.
You took care of that.
CHRIS
Yea that's right and I plan on taking
care of everything else too.
JAY
If you can, try to think this through.
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardise that by selling
drugs?
CHRIS
Cause you owned the town Jay. It's changed
now.
JAY
Really? See the only thing that I think
has changed around here is that every
morning you get to wake up and put on
that nifty lil badge. But underneath
that badge is the same guy that couldn't
make it playing college football, apparently
couldn't make it in the army and not
gonna make it as a cop.
CHRIS
Is that right?
JAY
Yea, and if you push too hard you're
gonna be a man who doesn't live to see
40. License please.
Chris hands it over.
JAY
Thanks sheriff.
CHRIS
Sir get your tail lights fixed, it's
your last warning.
JAY
What's wrong with my tail lights?
Chris smashes up the back end of Jay's car with his trusty piece
of cedar wood.
CHRIS
They're broken.
RAY
Mornin sheriff.
CHRIS
Mornin deputy.
Chris tosses Ray a badge.
RAY
No, nope, no. Come on man you know I
hate cops. You been sheriff 2 minutes
and I'm already startin to hate you.
I'm a convicted felon.
CHRIS
I got a lil pull around here.
RAY
Oh now you're a CROOKED cop doing favours
for friends. That's how it starts. See
next thing you know you'll be taking
bribes, setting up roadblocks, frisking
dudes crotches.
CHRIS
Are you done? Ray I need your help.
RAY
Oh don't do that.
CHRIS
I need you to take me to drugs school.
RAY
I get to wear a uniform?
A montage ensues, with Chris and Ray busting various drug dealers.
CHRIS
You're SURE you're not carrying anything.
BOOTH
I don't have shit.
CHRIS
Officer.
RAY
Yeah.
CHRIS
Search him.
RAY
Oh. Spread your legs, arms down. Been
workin out? Nothin there. Ohhhh somebody
needs a BATH!
BOOTH
Now you read me my rights and take me
in. And I call my lawyer.
RAY
K. I have a hunch there may be somethin
else in here (Pats the dealer's truck).
CHRIS
Could be.
Music plays while the two chop up the dealer's car into pieces
while laughing.
RAY
He's clean. Guess we gotta move to plan
B.
BOOTH
Screw you, I do have a bit of information
for you. It's not just me actually,
there's a whole lotta people in on this
one.
CHRIS
Spit it out.
BOOTH
You're gonna get hurt.
Jay calls a number on his celphone.
JAY
Do it.
Chris is in a police car driving at speed. He approaches the
mill and busts through the locked gates.
