      FADE IN:

601601EXT.  INNER CITY STREET - DAY

      GRAFFITI screams from the walls.  HOMELESS push shopping
      carts overflowing with the debris of other people's lives. 
      Hope, like Elvis, has definitely left the building.

      VRRROOOM!

      -- a motorcycle screams by with two riders.  A WOMAN'S LAUGH
      drifts back, on a trail of exhaust.

602602EXT.  CHECK CASHING PLACE - DAY

      A shining bastion of international commerce.  Garish red and
      yellow signs proclaim "CHECKS CASHED" in more languages than
      Saturday afternoon cable access.

      The bike ROARS up to the curb and stops.  It's Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    You gotta be joking.

                                      AMANDA (O.S.)
                    I never joke about money.  Especially
                    when it's mine.

      Amanda pops her head up from behind Richie's shoulder.  She
      looks over at the store.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Besides, the place has atmosphere.

      Richie sniffs the air, wrinkles his nose.

                                      RICHIE
                    Yeah.  I can smell it from here. 
                    What's wrong with a regular bank?

      Amanda swings herself off the bike.

                                      AMANDA
                      Unfortunately, dear boy, regular
                    banks are full of sad little men who
                    would insist on knowing all the dreary
                    little details of my overseas money
                    transfer.

                                      RICHIE
                    So?

      Amanda gestures toward the store.

                                      AMANDA
                    Behold the "Temple of No Questions
                    Asked."

                                      RICHIE
                    Amanda, that's called fraud.

                                      AMANDA
                    It's called C.Y.A.
                          (off his look)
                    Cover your assets.

      She heads for the front door.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Coming?

      Richie casts a wary glance up and down the street.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'd better stay with my bike.

603603INT.  CHECK CASHING PLACE - CONTINUOUS

      Peeling paint, chipped counter... and one very terrified
      male CLERK behind the counter.

      The Clerk slides a canvas bag across the counter to a MASKED
      BANDIT.  The Bandit wears a grey FEDORA pulled down over his
      eyes, a HANDKERCHIEF tied over his face and brandishes an
      old-fashioned TOMMY GUN.

                                    CORY
                    Relax!  I'm not going to hurt you.

      He stops, getting the BUZZ.  A BELL TINKLES behind him.  The
      Masked Bandit spins just as the front door swings shut behind
      Amanda.

                                      AMANDA
                    Uh, oh.

      Amanda and the Masked Bandit lock eyes.  A flash of
        recognition.

                                    CORY
                    Amanda!?

      Her jaw drops...

                                      AMANDA
                    Cory!?

      The Clerk sees his chance to hit the ALARM.  SIRENS galore.

                                    CORY
                    Damn!

      He grabs the money from the counter, grabs Amanda's arm.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    C'mon!  Time to blow.

604604EXT.  INNER CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

      At a corner food stand, Richie trades SOUVLAKI SAM two bucks
      for Indigestion on a Stick.  He's about to take a tentative
      bite when Cory explodes out the front door of the check
      cashing place pulling Amanda behind him.  She's yelling with
      excitement.

                                      AMANDA
                    Yeeeee!

      From down the street Richie sees the masked man, the gun,
      Amanda screaming -- puts two and two together.  He drops his
      lunch and rushes to her rescue.

                                      RICHIE
                    Hey!!!

      Cory swivels toward the noise, his Tommy Gun BARKING BULLETS
      into the air.

                                    CORY
                    Stay back!  Everybody!

      Souvlaki Sam SCREAMS.  Richie hits the dirt.  So do the rest
      of the PASSERSBY, obviously familiar with the duck and cover
      two-step.

      Cory and Amanda dash up to a VAN.  He pulls open the side
      door, shoves Amanda in and jumps in after her.

      Richie's on his feet again and pounding the pavement --

                                      RICHIE
                    Amanda!!!

      As the van BURNS RUBBER and disappears down a side street.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Amanda!!!

      The van speeds down the road, quickly leaving the city behind.

                                      AMANDA & CORY (O.S.)
                      Yeeeehaaaaw!

606606INT.  VAN - CONTINUOUS

      CORY RAINES is at the wheel.  Unmasked, fedora cocked back,
      he looks every part the handsome, debonair, gentlemanly...
      thief.  Amanda rides shotgun, feeding off his adrenalin rush,
      matching his excitement whoop for whoop.

                                    CORY
                    Seems like old times.

                                      AMANDA
                    Too old.  I haven't been in a getaway
                    car since... well, too long.

                                    CORY
                    Miss it?

                                      AMANDA
                    Yeah, I do.

      Cory glances at her out of the corner of his eye.

                                    CORY
                    Miss anything else?

      Amanda smiles mischievously, fondly remembering...

                                      AMANDA
                    Well --

      They both get the BUZZ.  Cory checks his rearview.  It's
      Richie on his bike.

                                    CORY
                    Hmmm... persistent little devil. 
                    Know him?

                                      AMANDA
                    A friend.

      Cory squints back at the bike.

                    Let's take a look at who you're making
                    friends with these days.

      His foot eases off the accelerator and

      RICHIE

      speeds up alongside the driver's side.  He cranes his neck
      to look in the window and sees

      AMANDA AND CORY

      looking back.  A sly smile curls Cory's lips.  Suddenly

      THE VAN

      lurches toward Richie.

      RICHIE

      reacts to the van.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)

                    What was that for?

      But Cory just shrugs it off -- a well worn gesture.

                                    CORY
                    Maybe I want you all to myself.

                                      AMANDA
                    I'm flattered, of course, but that
                    was too much.

                                    CORY

608608EXT. VAN

      Cory takes a side road on two wheels and pulls up into a
      clearing.

609609EXT. CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER

      Cory wipes down the van for fingerprints.

                                      AMANDA
                    Since when were you so careful?

                                    CORY
                    Since forensics got better.  Gettin'
                    hard for an honest man to make a
                    dishonest living these days.

      He glances at his watch, looks over to Amanda.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    Don't just stand there, we're two
                    minutes behind schedule already.

                                      AMANDA
                    We?  I'm just an innocent bystander.

                                    CORY
                    Don't kid yourself, sister.  Minute
                    you jumped in the van, you became an
                      accomplice.

      Cory walks up to her, feels the heat of her excitement.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    You and me, together again. Look at
                    you.  Your cheeks are flushed.  You
                    love it.

                                      AMANDA

                            cool)
                    Merely a metabolic surge in reaction
                    to external stimuli.

      Cory crosses to a large TARP under a tree.  With a magician's
      flourish, he whips off the tarp revealing a glittering 1924
      PACKARD.  Mint condition.

      Amanda loses her cool.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    The twenty-four Packard! I don't
                    believe it.

      Cory glances suggestively from the car to Amanda.

                    I've always appreciated the

                    Your chariot awaits, my queen.

610610EXT.  DITCH - SAME TIME

      Sopping wet and coveted with mud, Richie drags his crippled
      bike up the embankment.  He stands in the road, surveying
      the damage.

      A 1924 Packard GRILLE roaring towards him at warp speed. 
      It's speeding up.

                    Damn.

      THWACK!

      He bounces off the hood, up into the air and back flips down
      into the muddy stream.  Again.

      Richie sits poring over a glossy antique car book.

                                      MACLEOD
                    If you've got a better idea, I'm
                      listening.

                    Wait.  Here.

      He points to a gorgeous shot of a car that looks just like
      Cory's.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    This is it.

      MacLeod looks over his shoulder.

                    1924 Packard.  You're sure?

      He tries to nibble her neck, but she wriggles free.

                                      AMANDA
                    I can tell.

                    You always were a great-lookin' skirt.

                    hard to break.
                          (moving in again)
                      I remember one in particular.

      He nuzzles her ear, draws her to him.  She slips away.

                                      AMANDA
                    Cory... look, I'm flattered.  Really.

      But Amanda only shrugs noncommittally -- let him think what
      he wants.  She glances at her watch, remarks coyly...

                                      AMANDA
                    You know, I should really call home.

      A vintage Pierce Arrow sits perched up on the garage lift. 
      Underneath a well-oiled mechanic, REYNALDO, puts the finishing
      touches on the exhaust system as Richie and MacLeod enter.

                                      RICHIE
                    We're looking for a 1924 Packard.

                                      REYNALDO
                    I'm happy for you.

      Reynaldo turns back to the job at hand, ignores them.  Richie
      taps his shoulder.

                                      RICHIE
                          (insistent)
                    This is important.

                                      REYNALDO
                    Really?  You a cop or something?

                                      RICHIE
                    No.

                                      REYNALDO
                    Then buzz off.

      MacLeod thinks quickly, dons a French accent and the attitude
      to match --

                                      REYNALDO
                    I give up.  Who?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (isn't it obvious!)
                    I am Jacques Bellac!

      Reynaldo stares blankly.  So does Richie.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Oui!  Jacques Bellac!

      Richie clicks in, hurries to catch up --

                    I am!

      MacLeod paces the garage, hands waving, arms flailing, ranting
      against the cosmic injustice of it all.  Angst personified.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I, Jacques Bellac, am on the threshold

                    And yet, the gods, they mock me. 
                    The only thing my creation lacks is
                    a car.  But not just any car.
                          (wringing his hands)
                    Mais, non!  It must be a 1924 Packard!

      MacLeod rages over to Reynaldo, his eyes ablaze with insane
        inspiration.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    You, monsieur.

      MacLeod grabs Reynaldo's hands.

                    Just look at these hands.

      Greasy palms, dirt under the fingernails, but MacLeod sees --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    The hands of a genius!

                    my pain.

      He embraces Reynaldo, declares passionately --

                    I love this man.

      Reynaldo quickly detaches himself, searches his memory.

617617INT.  CHECK CASHING PLACE - DAY

      In the B.G., two UNIFORMS take notes while they talk to the
      Clerk.  Off to one side, Robbery Detective DENNIS TYNAN, has
      just finished interviewing the owner, SAM GRINGKOV.  Gringkov,
      from hard-working, immigrant stock, is clearly upset.  Tynan,
      rumpled, Peter Falk at 40, is on top of the case.

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN
                    Well, Mr. Gringkov, look at it this
                    way.  No one got hurt.  And they
                    didn't get away with much.

                    Yeah.  Yeah.  Few thousand, I guess. 
                    Too early to tell.

      Tynan waves the Uniforms over.

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN
                    Okay, boys.  We've taken up enough

      The Uniforms exit.  Tynan closes the door and turns back to
      Gringkov.

                    So what happened?

      Gringkov's eyes turn to ice.  He drops the poor confused
      victim routine, spits his reply --

                                      GRINGKOV
                    You tell me.  There was one-point-
                    four mil in laundered cash and I
                    want it back!  What the hell I pay
                    you for?  So lowlife can waltz in

                    I've already put the word out on the
                    street.  Nobody knows nothing.  The
                    guy came outta nowhere.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    I don't want hear no stinking excuses. 
                    All I know is I'm one and half million
                    poorer than I was this morning.  And
                    I am not happy.

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN
                    I'll make it right.

      Gringkov gets in Tynan's face.

                                      GRINGKOV

618618EXT.  CORY'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

      MacLeod and Richie creep stealthily around a bush, working
      their way towards a large log cabin.  Rustic but ritzy, cedar
      deck, hot tub, and a 1924 Packard in the lane.

                                      RICHIE
                    This is it.

      They slink along a row of bushes and up alongside the Packard. 
      MacLeod fingers a fresh DENT in the hood.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I see you made a good impression.

                                      RICHIE
                    Very funny.

      MacLeod and Richie share a look, move off toward the cabin.

619619INT. CORY'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

      A fire CRACKLES in the big stone fireplace.  Bearskin rugs
      blanket a gleaming wooden floor.  Gershwin TINKLES from
      concealed speakers.  And standing center stage, Cory, in a
      burgundy silk robe, fills a crystal champagne flute with the
      best bubbly stolen money can buy.

      He gets the BUZZ.  No time to react.

      MacLeod bursts through the front door.  Richie kicks in the
      back.  They rush the room, swords at the ready.

      Richie lunges for Cory.

                                      RICHIE
                    Where is she, you bastard!?

      He looks to his partner for backup, but MacLeod is LOWERING
      his sword!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Cory!?

      Amanda appears from another room.  She almost drops her
      champagne glass.

                                      AMANDA
                    MacLeod!?

      Now it's Richie's turn.  Relaxing his attack stance, he aims
      his dropped jaw in her direction.

      And through it all, ever the charming host, Cory extends a
      champagne flute to MacLeod --

620620INT.  CORY'S PLACE - NIGHT

      Like a game of "Statues," everyone is still frozen.  Cory
      breaks the ice first.

                                    CORY
                    Serial monogamy, Amanda?

      He looks from MacLeod to Richie and back again.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    Unless I'm seeing double... I count
                    two of them.

      He offers a champagne flute to MacLeod.

      RICHIE

      rushes up, knocks it out of his hand.  The glass SMASHES on
      the floor.  Cory turns to Richie, snaps his fingers --

                                    CORY
                    Now I recognize you.  You look a
                    little different flying over the
                    hood of a car.

      Richie cracks.

                                      RICHIE
                    How would you like to go flying
                    through a wall!?

                    Listen, Richie.  Cory didn't mean
                    anything personal by it.
                          (beat)
                    Did you, Cory?

                                    CORY
                    No, of course not.  I don't know him
                    well enough to dislike him yet.

                                      RICHIE
                    Alright!  That's it!

      Richie moves on Cory but MacLeod blocks him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Easy, Richie.

                    You're an Immortal, right?  It was
                    all in fun.

                                      RICHIE
                    All in fun?  Are you nuts?

      Cory puts his arm around Amanda.

                                    CORY
                    Let's everybody relax.  As you can
                    see, the lady's not in any immediate
                    physical jeopardy.

                          (shoots her a look)
                      Apparently not.  In fact, she's
                      positively glowing.

      Amanda taunts him with a smile.

                                    CORY
                    I was just going to suggest we dive

                    I'll take a rain check.  You know
                    what they say.  Two's company... but
                    four's just not sanitary.

      Cory turns to Amanda.

                                    CORY
                    I think he s still jealous...

621621EXT. ROAD - MISSOURI - 1926 - DAY

      Summer air shimmers in the heat.  Sun-scorched wheat fields
      stretch to the horizon. The only crop this year -- dust.

      ZOOM!

      Bisecting this beige wasteland, a cherry red ROADSTER blazes
      through FRAME.

622622INT.  ROADSTER - MISSOURI - 1926 - CONTINUOUS

      At the wheel of her convertible roadster, Amanda argues with
      MacLeod.  She is dressed in her circus spangles and wearing
      a glittery turban.

                                      AMANDA
                    Rules are made to be broken.  So are
                      contracts.

                                      MACLEOD
                    But we signed on to Barnum and
                    Bailey's for a year.  We can't just
                    leave.  Where are they going to find
                    an act to replace us?

                                      AMANDA
                    Let 'em use that third rate lion
                    tamer.  The "Amazing Amanda" does
                    not take second billing to anyone.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I thought he was pretty good.

      She punches it again.  MacLeod grips the door handle.

                                      AMANDA
                    And then expecting me to work that
                    tacky fortune teller scam between
                    shows!

      She tears off the turban and tosses it out of the car.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (trying to calm her)
                    But you were great.  Really.  With
                    that turban and crystal ball...
                    could've fooled me.

      Amanda growls and tromps on the accelerator.

                                      AMANDA
                            (dismissive)
                    Ugh.  Parlor tricks for rubes.  Is
                    that why I spent sixty years
                      perfecting my tightrope technique?

      MacLeod mistakes this for a rhetorical question and doesn't
      reply.  Besides, he's got his eye on a HERD OF COWS looming
      up ahead.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Well!?  Is it!?

                    Uh... Amanda.  You may want to slow
                    down a bit.

                                      AMANDA
                    You're not even listening.

                    You don't care about me.  You don't
                    care how depressed I get playing all
                    these one-pump towns night after
                    night.  Where's the glamour?  Where s
                    the glitz?  Where's the Great White
                    Way?

      Up ahead, a herd of cows move slowly across the road.  MacLeod
      tries to get Amanda's attention.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda!

      Taking desperate action, MacLeod wrenches the wheel from her
      grip and stomps on the brake with his foot.

      The roadster SKIDS to a stop centimeters from the cows.

                                      AMANDA
                    Edgy today, aren t we?

      An ARMORED CAR pulls up and stops on the other side of the
      herd.  MacLeod takes a deep breath and begins to relax, then
      he gets the BUZZ.  Amanda checks her mirror but MacLeod points
      through the windshield.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There.

      They watch as a sleek black ROADSTER pulls up beside the
      Armored Car.

      Out of this roadster jumps Cory, Tommy Gun in hand.  He runs
      to the Armored Car and hurtles a GAS GRENADE through the
      view slot.  It EXPLODES in a burst of SMOKE.

      MacLeod and Amanda are out of their car in a flash.  MacLeod
      starts moving through the cows that block his path.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Damn!
                          (to the cows)
                    Excuse me. Pardon me.

      On the other side of the herd, the two SECURITY GUARDS stumble
      out of the armored car, coughing and gagging from the gas. 
      Cory cold-conks both of the Guards, apologizing as he goes.

                                    CORY
                    Sorry, fellas.  But it's all in the
                    name of charity.

      The Guards lie motionless as Cory drags a couple of money
      bags from rear of the armored car.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96506     "Money No Object"    21.    Final Shooting Script 8/14/96

      He takes a few bills, stuffs them into their shirt pockets.

                    There's a little something for your
                    trouble.  I'll mail you a receipt
                    for the rest.

      Cory tosses the money bags into his roadster, jumps in, does
      a 180.

      In the midst of the cows, MacLeod silently curses.

                                      MACLEOD

      tips his grey fedora, waves a cheery adieu to his captive
      audience as he speeds away.

                    That Immortal just robbed that armored

      They react to the BUZZ and turn and see

      On the front porch, Cory is handing out some of the stolen
      money to a poor young FARMER and his WIFE while their three
        malnourished CHILDREN look on.  Dressed in rags, they have
      the gaunt, bleak faces of people who gave up hope a long

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    I just gave that family hope.  Chance
                    to head west to California and begin
                    again.  A new life.

      Cory plays it up.  He puts a hand on his heart.  MacLeod's
      not buying.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Oh, brother... let me get my violin.

                                    CORY
                    Aw, c'mon, pal.  It's not like I
                    took all the bank's money.  They've
                    got lots left.

      MacLeod points out the remaining money in Cory's bag.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And so do you.

                                    CORY
                    Try thinking of me as the Robin Hood
                    of the Roaring Twenties.

      MacLeod can't help but like Cory, but he knows he's an
      accident waiting to happen.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Well, I got news for you, Robin. 
                    This isn't Sherwood Forest.  And
                    you're not robbing the rich.  You're
                    stealing from banks.  Banks that
                    hold other people's money.
                          (gestures toward family)
                    People like them.

      While MacLeod and Cory talk, the Farmer tries to start the
      vehicle.  He fails.

                                    CORY
                    Hey.  Nobody gets hurt, and I get to
                    do a little good for the common folk.

                    Block's cracked.

      The Farmer's Wife sags against the truck, their new-found
      hope snatched away again.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    What now, Robin?

      Cory sighs.  Looks at the truck, looks at his roadster.  He
      makes a decision.

                                    CORY
                    Hey!  Catch!

      He tosses the keys to his beloved roadster to the Farmer.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    Take care of her and she'll take
                    care of you.

      The Farmer can't believe his good luck.

                                      FARMER
                    Thank you.  Thank you.

                                      AMANDA
                    Cory, that was the most unselfish
                    thing I've ever seen.

                                    CORY
                    Thanks, Amanda.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (with a half smile)
                    Now I suppose you'll be wanting a
                    lift?

      Cory slaps MacLeod jovially on the back.

                                    CORY
                    I knew you'd come around!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (resigned)
                    C'mon, Robin... get in.
                          (to the Farmer)
                    If I were you, I'd switch the plates
                    before you hit the main road.  She's
                    probably a little hot.

                                    CORY
                    A minor detail, Mackie-boy.  A minor
                    detail.

      And as MacLeod gives Amanda an "I told you so" look, they
      head off down the lane.

625625EXT.  ROAD - MISSOURI - 1926 - DAY

      Just your typical pastoral scene -- sun shining, birds
      chirping, three Immortals speeding through the countryside
      in a red roadster.

      Amanda points up ahead.

                                      AMANDA
                    Uh-oh.

      MacLeod strains to see.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Uh-oh.

      Cory peeks around.

                                    CORY
                    Oh brother.

      There's a ROADBLOCK dead ahead.  Three police cars block the
      way through.  MacLeod starts a U-turn.  Too late.

      POLICE swarm out of the trees on either side of the road,
      effectively blocking any escape.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Look's like this is the end of the
                    party.

      Amanda glances in the back seat.

                                      AMANDA
                    This definitely doesn't look good.

      Cory's not fazed at all.  If anything, he's a little
        disappointed in his new playmates.

                                    CORY
                    Oh, please.  Where's your sense of
                      adventure?

      The CORDON of Police closes in.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Right now, I'd say it's looking at
                    ten to twenty years behind bars.

                                    CORY
                    Don't worry.  I always got a plan.

      Silence.  MacLeod and Amanda are waiting.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Now would be a good time.

                                    CORY
                    Okay.  I got it.  You're my hostages,

                    the robbery.
                          (warms to it)
                    Yeah, that's it!  And you two get

                    I'll be waiting for you guys to dig
                    me up.

      MacLeod and Amanda exchange looks... "Dig him up...?"

      In a flash, Cory's out of the car, wielding his Tommy Gun. 
      He sprays the air with hot lead, then he points his gun at
      the car.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    Freeze or I blast these hostages
                    into swiss cheese!

      Everybody freezes.  MacLeod and Amanda raise their hands. 
      Cory points the gun at the cops.  He moves toward them
      threateningly.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    You'll never take me alive, coppers!

      Like shooting a well-dressed fish in a barrel, the Police
      open fire and Cory goes down in a hail of bullets.

      As several Cops crowd around his lifeless body.  Amanda and
      MacLeod get out of the car.

                                      AMANDA
                    Thank God you shot that horrible
                    man!  He threatened to kill us!

      As an OFFICER approaches, MacLeod pulls her head down onto
      his shoulder, comforts her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There, there, dear.  It's all over.

626626EXT.  PAUPER'S GRAVE - 1926 - DAY

      MacLeod and Amanda are digging up a pauper's grave.  MacLeod's
      working, Amanda leans on her shovel.

      MacLeod's shovel strikes wood.

                    About time.

      He starts to work on the coffin lid.

                    You know, it'd serve him right...

                    MacLeod!  Don't even think about it.

      OFF her look he pries open the lid, revealing Cory inside. 
      A shaft of sunlight strikes his face and his eyes pop open.

      MacLeod bends over to lend a hand, but Cory's up and out of
      the grave like a jack-in-the-box.

                                    CORY

      Cory thinks he must be joking, slaps him on the back.

                    Looks like it's just the two of us.

      They walk to her roadster, Cory takes the wheel.

                                    CORY
                    Just you and me, dollface.
                          (over his shoulder)
                    So long, Mackie-boy.  It coulda been
                    fun.

      MacLeod watches as Amanda and Cory pull out of the graveyard.

      Amanda turns to look back, something in her eyes pleading
      with MacLeod to stop her.  But he stays strong.  Hat pushed
      back, jacket slung over his shoulder, MacLeod just watches
      them drive away -- finally, the roadster becomes a dot on
      the horizon.

      With a last look down at the now-empty grave, MacLeod turns
      and heads down the road the other way.

                          (fondly)
                    Boy, those were the days.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Are you out of your mind?  How many
                    bullets did they pump into you?

                                    CORY
                    More than Bonnie, less than Clyde. 
                    What's the difference?

      MacLeod signals to Richie, they're leaving.

                                      MACLEOD
                    C'mon Richie.
                          (to Amanda)
                    Amanda?

      Amanda knows that tone, she puts her champagne glass down. 
      She gathers up her things, follows Richie and MacLeod to the
      door.  Cory calls after --

                                    CORY
                    Amanda... think about tomorrow.

      Amanda just smiles.  As they move out, she blows him a kiss
      goodbye.

                    How can you like this guy?  He treats
                      everything like a joke.

                                      AMANDA
                    That's why I like him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, what did Cory mean about
                    tomorrow?

      She plays it cool, buffs her nails against her sleeve.

      She borrows the rearview mirror to fix her hair.

                                      AMANDA
                    He wanted me to do a little job.

                                      MACLEOD
                            (persistent)
                    What kind of job?

      Amanda sighs.  He's worse than a parent, sometimes.

                                      AMANDA
                    The Federal Reserve.

      MacLeod reacts, hits the gas and with an angry roar, the 
      T-Bird speeds off down the lane.

      FADE IN:

632632INT.  MACLEOD'S LOFT - NIGHT

      MacLeod paces back and forth in front of an obstinate Amanda. 
      From the sidelines, Richie's eyes track MacLeod like a tennis
      ball at Wimbledon.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're not actually thinking of
                    helping Cory rob the Federal Reserve!?

      Amanda only plants her feet firmer.

                                      AMANDA
                    So what if I am?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, this is not some Ma and Pa
                    outfit in Hicksville.  You're talking
                    about the Federal Reserve!

                                      AMANDA
                    C'mon MacLeod.  It's not the whole
                    Federal Reserve.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (dryly)
                    That's a relief.

                                      AMANDA
                    It's more like... a Federal Reserve
                    truck.  A little one.  And Cory
                    promised no one will get hurt.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He can guarantee that?

                                      AMANDA
                    He's got a plan.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He always has a plan!

                                      AMANDA
                    You are jealous.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I am not jealous.

                    Oh yeah?
                          (beat; believes him)
                    Why not?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because this is all a big joke to
                    Cory, that's why.  You're shot, you
                    die, bingo, you pop back up again.
                          (with feeling)
                    Amanda, Immortality is a gift, not a
                    game.  You don't go running people
                    down for fun.

                                      RICHIE (O.S.)
                    Damn right.

      They both turn to stare at Richie.  In the heat of the moment,
      they forgot he was there.  A LONG BEAT as Richie feels their
      eyes on him.  He reddens.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Not that I'm taking sides.

      MacLeod turns back to Amanda.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Listen, you get in over your head,
                    don't come looking for me to bail
                    you out.

      Amanda swallows.  Richie does a double take.

                                      AMANDA
                    What are you saying?  You're throwing
                    me out?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I didn't say that.

                                      AMANDA
                    Sounded a helluva lot like that to
                    me.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You don't need the money.

      But she stopped listening long ago.

                                      AMANDA
                    Far be it from me to stay where I'm
                    not wanted.

      She picks up her jacket, puts it on.

                                      AMANDA
                    I know what I heard.  You don't need
                    to tell me twice.

      She spins on her heels and storms out.

                                      MACLEOD

                    So now I'm stupid, too.

                    It's amazing, MacLeod.  We've known
                    each other for 350 years and you
                    still don't know.

      MacLeod can only watch as she walks out the door.

                    Okay, let's see this plan of yours.

      She plops down on his sofa.  Cory accepts his good fortune
      and decides to shut his mouth as well as the door.  He pours
      Amanda a glass of wine, pulls out a map.

                                      AMANDA
                    I knew you'd come after me.

      But it's not MacLeod who comes through the back door.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Richie!?  Where's MacLeod?

                    Forget it.  I'm doing the job, and
                    that's that.

                                      RICHIE

                    You're wasting your time.

                    Look, you don't really want to be
                    with Cory.  You're just doing it to
                    get back at MacLeod.

                                      AMANDA
                    Thanks for the insight, Oprah.  But
                    you're wrong.  I miss the good old
                    days.  Racing from town to town,
                    always one step ahead of the cops.

                    I know Mac comes on a little strong. 
                    But that's only because he cares

                    And that's the difference between
                    MacLeod and Cory!

      Amanda gets up, paces the room.

                    A woman wants to be wanted.  Hell,

                    that.

                                      AMANDA
                    Then why didn't he tell me to stay.

                                      RICHIE
                    Amanda, nobody tells you anything.

                                      AMANDA
                    That's beside the point.

      She stops pacing, declares to no one in particular

                    No.  This is the right thing.  It's
                    time to cut loose again.  Time to

      Amanda spreads out Cory's map on a table, motions Richie
      over to see.

                    This is the armored car route.

                    Yeah, so?

      She points to an intersection on the map.

                                      AMANDA
                    And here's where they're gonna stop.

      FADE IN:

640640EXT.  ROAD OUT OF TOWN - DAY

      Still prostrate on the ground, an ashen MacLeod slowly wakes
      up.  Cory extends a hand, but gets brushed aside.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Get away from me.

                                    CORY
                    Aw, c'mon Mackie-boy.

      MacLeod gingerly stands up.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And don't call me Mackie-boy.

      Cory instinctively backs away.

                                    CORY
                    Yeah, sure.  No hard feelings, eh?

      MacLeod advances on Cory.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (hisses)
                    You mean, why let a little thing
                    like being blown to bits come between
                    us?

                                    CORY
                    All in fun, eh?  All in fun.  Hey,
                    think now.  You can't kill me.  You
                    need me to get Amanda out...

      Cory smiles ingratiatingly.  MacLeod knows he's right.  And
      he hates him for it.

641641INT.  MACLEOD S LOFT - DAY

      MacLeod on the phone, strains to hear over Cory and Richie's
      constant caterwauling in the background.

                                      RICHIE
                    First you run me off the road.  Then,
                    you get Amanda arrested.  Now, you've
                    blown up Mac.

                                    CORY
                          (glancing at MacLeod)
                    Hardly the worse for wear.

                    Why don't you try it?

      MacLeod slams down the phone... loudly.

                                      MACLEOD
                    SHUT UP!  Both of you.

      Duly chastised, they relent.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    The police don't have Amanda.

                                      RICHIE & CORY
                    What!

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                      Everybody's got the same story.  No
                    progress on the robbery case.  No
                    arrests made.  No suspects in custody. 
                    No Amanda.

                                      RICHIE
                    If the cops don't have her, then who
                    does?

                                      MACLEOD
                      Exactly...   Cory?

                                    CORY
                    You're not going to like this.
                          (beat)
                    Sam Gringkov.

                                      RICHIE & MACLEOD
                    You stole from Sam Gringkov?!

642642EXT.  DOCK YARD - DAY

      The forlorn BLEAT of a tugboat pierces the eerie stillness. 
      In one end of the yard, a battered aluminum CONSTRUCTION
      TRAILER perches precariously on cement blocks.

                                      AMANDA (O.S.)
                      Peee-yuuu!  What's that horrible
                    stench?  Oh, of course.  It's a rotten
                    cop.

643643INT.  CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

      Amanda sits tied to a chair in the trailer.  Detective Tynan
      raises his arm to strike her, but Gringkov stops him.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    Don't damage the insurance policy.

      Amanda smiles at Gringkov.

                                      AMANDA
                    Obviously a gentlemen of discretion.
                          (takes in his clothes)
                    Though of somewhat dubious fashion
                    sense.

      Gringkov chuckles a low chuckle.  He can rise above it.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    Your partner took something that
                    didn't belong to him.  Namely, my
                    money.

      Gringkov puts his mouth an inch from her face.

                                      GRINGKOV (CONT'D)
                    And I want it back!

      She recoils.

                                      AMANDA
                    You really should brush again after
                    lunch.

      Tynan has had enough.  He lunges forward.

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN
                    And you really should shut your mouth.

                                      AMANDA
                    Relax, Fido.
                          (to Gringkov)
                    My hands are tied.  You'll have to
                    dial.

644644INT.  MACLEOD'S LOFT - DAY

      MacLeod is on the phone as --

                                      RICHIE
                    You actually thought you'd get away
                    with stealing money from Sam Gringkov. 
                    You're not a thief, you're an idiot.

      MacLeod steps in, mediates.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (to Richie)
                    Alright, alright, we get the idea.
                          (to Cory)
                    We give back the money, he gives
                    back Amanda.

                    Sorry, no can do.

      MacLeod grabs him by the throat.

                                      MACLEOD
                    come again?

                                    CORY
                    I gave the money away.

                                      RICHIE
                    Yeah, right.  To an orphanage, I
                    suppose.

                                    CORY
                    Actually, yes.  The Little Angels
                      Orphanage.  You know, just across
                    town.
                          (to MacLeod)
                    You can check if you want.

      MacLeod releases Cory's throat, Cory seizes the moment.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                          (lays it on thick)
                    Hey... guys... you know what it's
                    like...  growing up in one of those
                    places...  no money, no toys, no
                    love.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Okay, Mother Theresa, so how do you
                    expect to pay back Gringkov?

                                    CORY
                    I was thinking you could front me
                    the money?  Strictly a loan, of
                    course.

                                      MACLEOD
                    One point four million dollars?!

                                    CORY
                    Yeah, right.  Recession.  Okay, we'll
                    just have to steal it.
                          (snaps fingers)
                    I got a plan!  We go for the Federal

                    Uh, except for that little timer
                    thing.

      MacLeod smiles a frightening smile, bears his pearly whites
      in Cory's direction.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I've got a better idea, Cory.

645645EXT.  CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - NIGHT

      Close on a VEST wired with EXPLOSIVES and a PLUNGER DETONATOR.

                                    CORY (O.S.)
                    There's got to be another way.

      PULL BACK

      to find MacLeod with Cory.  The vest is on him.

                                    CORY
                    Let's be creative!  Work with me

                          (hands him detonator)
                    Here's the plunger.

                                    CORY
                    But it's a fake one, right?

                    Trust me.  I got a plan.

      He tightens the cinches on the vest, Cory's lungs collapse.

      Richie rounds a corner carrying a briefcase filled with
      "money." He opens the case for MacLeod's inspection.

                                      RICHIE
                    How'd I do?

      MacLeod reaches in, pulls out a stack of "bills" -- actually
      a few real bills on top, pieces of newspaper on the bottom.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    They better not look too close.

                    They won't have time to.

      He smiles at Cory.

      The briefcase sits in front of Gringkov and Tynan.

      Gringkov tries to open it, but it's locked with a COMBINATION
      LOCK.  He looks up at Cory who stands beside Amanda.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    What gives?

                    ...the combination to the briefcase.

      Gringkov aims his gun at the briefcase lock.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    Screw the combination.

                    Uh uh uh... any attempt to tamper
                    with the lock will detonate the
                    contents.

                    You wouldn't!?

                                    CORY
                    Sixty seconds... and leave the money
                    on your way out.

      Gringkov stands there nervously.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    You're bluffing.

                                    CORY
                      Forty-five to go.

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN
                    Hell, it's not my money.

      He rushes out.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    You're not that crazy.

      Cory reaches into his pocket and takes out a stick of
      dynamite.  He lights it.

      Gringkov runs out the door.  Cory smiles and pulls the fuse.

647647EXT.  CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

      MacLeod, Amanda and Richie watch the trailer from a distance.

                                      AMANDA
                    Looks like it worked, MacLeod.

      Suddenly Tynan and Gringkov come tearing out of the trailer,
      running for their lives.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Now for the grand finale.

      He reaches into his breast pocket and pulls out a device. 
      It's a wireless ELECTRONIC TRIGGER.

                                      RICHIE
                    You didn't.

      Amanda is shocked --

                                      AMANDA
                    You wouldn't!?

      and a little turned on --

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Would you... ?

                                      RICHIE
                    Let me.

      He grabs for the detonator.  MacLeod snatches it away.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Uh uh.  This one's all mine.

      He presses the switch and -- BLAAAMM!!

      The construction trailer is airborne.  Like a giant aluminum
      can, it's up, up and away.  And then a shattering CRASH. 
      Flat as a pancake.  Scraps of money and newspaper drift
      through the air.  Nothing left standing.  Well, almost
      nothing.

      Through the smoke and fire, one lone, slightly scorched figure
      staggers out of the wreckage.  It lurches over toward MacLeod.

                                    CORY
                    What the hell was that for?

      Again that frightening smile.

                                      MACLEOD
                    All in fun, Cory-boy. All in fun.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

648648INT.  MACLEOD'S LOFT     DAY

      MacLeod enters, sees Amanda's bags packed.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (re: suitcases)
                    Somebody leaving?

      Amanda tries to keep it light.

                                      AMANDA
                    Cory already blew town.  Said he had
                    a plan.  Time I hit the road, too. 
                    Least 'til Gringkov stops looking
                    for me.

      MacLeod watches her face.  He knows what she wants to hear. 
      It hangs like an unseen barrier between them.  Much to his
      own surprise, he says it --

                                      MACLEOD
                    I wish you could stay.

      And the invisible obstacle vanishes.  Amanda's up and across
      the room without touching the floor.  She looks up at MacLeod,
      into his eyes.  He meets her gaze -- no walls.

      They both know how much it took for him to give that to her.

                                      AMANDA
                    That's nice to hear.

      They kiss.  She pulls away and glances at her watch.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    But I really do have to go.

      MacLeod smiles.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Of course you do.

      Amanda gathers up her suitcases, starts for the door.  A
      toss of her head --

                                      AMANDA
                    Hey, Mackie-boy.  Maybe I'll see you
                    in Paris?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (as the French director)
                    But of course, my cherie, but of
                    course.

      And she's out the door.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
