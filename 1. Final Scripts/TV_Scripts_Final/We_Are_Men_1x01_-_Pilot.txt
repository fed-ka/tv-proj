                                  COLD OPEN


      INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE - DAY 

      A ruggedly HANDSOME GUY, 30-ish, drives rapidly.

                                   NARRATOR
                    There are defining moments in life 
                    that change everything.


      EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - CONTINUOUS 

      The car whips around the corner, speeding down the block. 


      EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY 

      It pulls up to the curb. He hops out, and RINGS THE DOORBELL.

                                    WOMAN S VOICE
                    If you re looking for Sara... 

      It s the NEIGHBOR, pushing a stroller down the sidewalk.

                                  NEIGHBOR (CONT D)
                    She s getting married today.

                                  HANDSOME GUY
                          (frantic)
                    Where? Do you know where? I m, 
                    uh... supposed to... read a poem.

                                  NEIGHBOR
                    First Presbyterian on Riverside. 
                    You better hurry.

      He dashes back to his car.


      EXT. VENTURA BLVD - DAY 

      The Mustang weaves in and out, passing cars. 


      INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE - CONTINUOUS 

      He drives like a Nascar champ, until -- 


      EXT. VENTURA BLVD - CONTINUOUS 

      Road construction. Traffic comes to a standstill.                                                                                     2


      INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE - CONTINUOUS 

      He pounds the dashboard in frustration, then pulls the car 
      onto the shoulder.


      EXT. VENTURA BLVD - CONTINUOUS 

      He jumps out and starts running along the side of the road.   
      He hops the fence, blazing a short-cut -- 


      EXT. PARK - DAY 

      He dashes across the grass, through a touch football game.


      EXT. ALLEY - DAY 

      He sprints by the trash bags and dumpsters. 


      EXT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - DAY 

      He darts up the stairs two at a time and --


      INT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - CONTINUOUS 

      Bursts in! The BRIDE and GROOM stand at the altar.

                                  MINISTER
                    ...to be your lawfully wedded 
                      husband...

                                  HANDSOME GUY
                    Don t marry him! I love you, Sara!

      The bride, SARA, stands there, confused and scared.  

      She looks back at the groom... then yanks off her veil and 
      dashes down the aisle. The CAMERA FOLLOWS the exhilarated 
      couple running out into the beautiful fall day. But then --

      The CAMERA WHIPS back to the jilted GROOM. Meet CARTER, 28, 
      handsome, charming, funny and... shell-shocked. 

                                  NARRATOR (AKA CARTER S V.O.)
                    This was my defining moment.

                                  MINISTER
                    Oy.

                                  END OF COLD OPEN                                                                                   3


                                  ACT ONE


      INT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - CONTINUOUS 

      As we were. Carter stands at the altar, devastated. 

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Losing love is like coming to terms 
                    with death. You have to go through 
                    the five stages of grief.


      INT. BALLROOM, STAGE - DAY 

      The worst WEDDING RECEPTION of all time. A SMATTERING OF 
      GUESTS mingle awkwardly. Carter swigs a champagne bottle, 
      yammering into the mic.  

                                  CARTER
                    She just got cold feet! She ll be 
                    back any minute! Let s party!

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Denial.


      INT. BALLROOM, DANCE FLOOR - TWENTY MINUTES LATER 

      Carter screams, as he SMASHES the wedding cake with a chair.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Anger. Next comes bargaining.


      EXT. STREET - TWO DAYS LATER

      He walks down the sidewalk, on his cell, leaving a message.

                                  CARTER
                    I ll take cooking classes with you.  
                    I ll totally wear the V-neck 
                    sweater you bought me. I ll never 
                    again ask you to do that thing in 
                    bed you don t want to do. Unless 
                    you want to spice things up, then 
                    I m willing to discuss it.


      INT. CARTER S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - ONE WEEK LATER 

      It hasn t been redecorated since he was sixteen. He sits on 
      his old bed, comatose.                                                                                   4


                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Then depression.

      His MOM enters, handing him a glass of juice.

                                  CARTER S MOM
                    It s so nice to have a man around 
                    the house again.

      Carter s DAD pokes his head in.

                                  CARTER S DAD
                    Tell your mother I can hear her.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    I had to find someplace else to 
                    live.

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      Carter in the EXACT SAME POSITION. Only this time PULL BACK 
      TO REVEAL he is now...


      EXT. OAKWOOD APARTMENTS, POOL - DAY 

      ...sitting on a lounge chair, poolside.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    The brochure says it  quality, 
                      furnished, short-term housing.   
                    After being here a few weeks, I d 
                    say it s more like a way station 
                    for guys who just got divorced, or 
                    dumped, or are otherwise incapable 
                    of buying their own furniture. 

      The CAMERA WHIPS to --

      A 50-year-old, floating on a raft, listening to his iPod. 

      This is FRANK RUSSO, a college drop-out who built, ran and is 
      now semi-retired from a clothing manufacturing company.  

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Frank Russo. After sixteen years of 
                    marriage, he and his wife had grown 
                    apart.


      INT. BUNGALOW, KITCHEN - FLASHBACK - DAY 

      A pretty woman, 50-ish, throws a COFFEE POT at Frank. Ouch!                                                                                   5


                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    But then Frank found true happiness 
                    with...


      INT. CHURCH - FLASHBACK - DAY 

      Frank lifts the wedding veil of his new 40-ish wife.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Lauren.

      He lifts another veil. This one is 30-ish.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Then Stacy.

      He lifts another veil. 20-ish.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Then Jessica.


      EXT. THE OAKWOOD, POOL - BACK TO PRESENT 

      On Frank floating by, a satisfied grin on his face.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    After his fourth divorce, Frank 
                    vowed the next time he found true 
                      happiness, he was just going to 
                    sleep with it for a few weeks.

      The CAMERA WHIPS to --

      A 34-year-old guy under an umbrella, doing a crossword 
      puzzle.

      This is GIL BROOKS, a nice, sweet guy, who owns a Spa and 
      Pool equipment store.  

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Gil Brooks. Separated.


      INT. RANCH HOUSE BEDROOM - FLASHBACK - DAY 

      A woman lies naked under a sheet. GIL hurries in, taking off 
      his clothes and joins her in bed.

                                  HIM
                    The kid s napping, we have twenty 
                    minutes.                                                                                   6


                                  HER
                    Not now. I had pizza for lunch.

                                  HIM
                    Come on, we haven t had sex in weeks.

                                  HER
                    No, I m bloated.

                                  HIM
                    We can do it from the side. I ll do 
                    all the work.

                                  HER
                    I don t want you to touch me.

      As the mood continues to sour, GIL S WIFE enters.

                                  GIL S WIFE
                    Oh, my God!

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Gil got caught having the World s 
                    Worst Affair.


      EXT. THE OAKWOOD, POOL - BACK TO PRESENT 

      On Gil, erasing a wrong answer.  

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    He moved here temporarily until he 
                    can convince his wife to take him 
                    back. That was a year and a half ago.

      The CAMERA WHIPS to --

      A SEXY, BIKINI-CLAD WOMAN sunbathing.  

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    I don t know the first thing about 
                    her. I m depressed, not dead.

      The CAMERA WHIPS to -- 

      A 38-year-old guy wearing a bathrobe and yelling into a 
      bluetooth cell phone hooked to his ear.

      This is STUART STEGEMAN, a feisty, Republican-leaning, Yale-
      educated doctor, with a booming OB-GYN practice.  

                                  STUART
                    She gave me chlamydia once, see if 
                    she wants half of that back!                                                                                   7


                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Dr. Stuart Stegeman.


      INT. CHURCH - FLASHBACK - DAY 

      An elaborate black-tie wedding. A beaming STUART stands at 
      the altar with his beautiful bride.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Stuart was madly in love with a 
                    young divorce attorney.


      INT. LEGAL OFFICE - FLASHBACK - DAY 

      Stuart, flanked by his lawyer, sits across from his estranged 
      wife.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    ...who, it turns out, was very good 
                    at her job.

      Stuart writes a hefty check, hands it to his ex.


      EXT. WOODS - FLASHBACK - DAY 

      A hippy-dippy wedding. A beaming Stuart stands at the altar 
      with his new yogi bride.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Next time, Stuart fell for a more 
                    spiritual woman. Who unfortunately 
                    developed a taste for the material 
                    world...


      INT. LEGAL OFFICE - FLASHBACK - DAY 

      Stuart, again flanked by his attorney, sits across from his 
      second estranged wife.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    She hired the most ruthless lawyer 
                    she could find.

      Stuart s FIRST EX-WIFE enters, and joins her new client.  
      Stuart lowers his head in despair.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    But Stuart was smarter this time...                                                                                   8


      EXT. THE OAKWOOD, POOL - BACK TO PRESENT 

      Stuart stands, getting ready to take a swim.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    He can afford a big house in Bel 
                    Air but he s living here, hiding 
                    his assets until a settlement is 
                    reached.

      He removes his robe, revealing a skimpy speedo.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                      Unfortunately, not all his assets.

      As he dives into the water, the CAMERA TILTS with him, 
      lingering on the AGITATED WATER. After a beat --

      WE PULL OUT of the water, to a view of all four guys sitting 
      in the JACUZZI.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Here s the thing. It s never easy 
                    opening up. But since these guys 
                    have all been through horrible 
                      break-ups, I felt comfortable. I 
                    felt like I could tell them how 
                    much I still miss Sara.

                                  STUART
                    She s a whore.

                                  FRANK
                    Listen closely. Craig s list.  
                    Keyword: Asians.

                                  CARTER
                    I m not ready to start dating.

                                  FRANK
                    Who said anything about dating? 

                                  CARTER
                    You guys don t understand. It s not 
                    that easy for me. Sara s the only 
                    woman I ve ever been with.

                                  GIL
                    Really? 

                                  STUART
                    That s impossible.                                                                                    9


                                  FRANK
                    I m offended by it.

                                  CARTER
                    I fell in love with her the first 
                    week of college. What was I 
                    supposed to do?  

                                  GIL
                    Junior year abroad? A semester at 
                    sea? 

                                  FRANK
                    No, no. This is a blessing. She did 
                    you a favor. We re taking you under 
                    our wing. 

                                  STUART
                    We did the same thing for Gil.

                                  GIL
                    I was here before you. 

                                  STUART
                    But you didn t use the time well.

                                  FRANK
                    Carter, look around you. You don t 
                    know it yet, but you re living in 
                    paradise. 

                                  CARTER
                    This is paradise? It s temporary 
                    housing. 

                                  FRANK
                    Temporary housing with a great gym.  
                    Indoor parking. Two Starbucks and a 
                    Coffee Bean in walking distance.  
                    And this is Hollywood. Actresses 
                    come through here all the time.  
                    Enter Frank stage left. Then 
                    upstage, downstage and backstage, 
                    if she ll let me. 
                          (sheepish smile)
                    And one did, last week, right here 
                    in this jacuzzi.

      Off looks of horror...


      INT. THE OAKWOOD, REC ROOM - NIGHT

      The guys shoot pool.                                                                                   10


                                  STUART
                    The point is, nobody knows more 
                    about break-ups than we do. Between 
                    the three of us, we have seven 
                    failed marriages.

                                  GIL
                    Six. Any day now, Claire s going to 
                    forgive me and we re --

                                  STUART
                    Yeah, yeah, you re going to renew 
                    your vows in Maui. Tell you what, 
                    I ll pay for the whole thing  cause 
                    it s never going to happen.

                                  GIL
                          (playful)
                    You re no longer invited.

                                  FRANK
                    Carter, come on, we re taking you 
                    out for drinks. 

                                  STUART
                          (re Carter s argyle V-neck)
                    But don t wear that sweater. We 
                    might go someplace from the present.

                                  CARTER
                    What s wrong with this sweater?  
                    Sara bought me this sweater.  
                          (proud)
                    It s reversible.

                                  GIL
                    Much like her love for you. Up 
                    high, fellas. That was good, right?
                          (beat)
                    Come on, give me some love. I 
                    really need it.

      Stuart reluctantly high-fives him.

                                  GIL (CONT D)
                    Okay, you re back on the guest 
                    list. Let s get out of here.

                                  CARTER
                    I just need a second to change.

      Carter takes off the sweater, turns it inside out, puts it 
      back on.                                                                                   11


      INT. CASA VEGA - NIGHT 

      The guys sit at a table, drinking cocktails. 

                                  CARTER
                    So last night I went on her 
                    facebook page...

                                  FRANK
                    Why? Why would you do that? 

                                  GIL
                      Guaranteed tears.

                                  STUART
                    So you could look at her with that 
                    douchebag trainer she left you for?  
                    Let me guess. A lot of pictures of 
                    him shirtless on the beach.

                                  CARTER
                    No. He s mostly doing yard work.

                                  GIL
                    Handy. Woman go nuts for that.

                                  FRANK
                    There s more than a few pictures of 
                    me shirtless on facebook.

                                  CARTER
                      I shouldn t ve have looked. I just 
                    have too much time on my hands. I 
                    don t even have a job anymore -- I 
                    was working for her dad. 

                                  STUART
                    He fired you?! This is a family of 
                    animals.

                                  CARTER
                    No, he was totally cool about it. I 
                    quit. Believe it or not, marketing 
                      industrial paint is even more 
                    boring than it sounds. 

                                  FRANK
                    So what are you going to do? 
                    World s your oyster.

                                  CARTER
                    I don t know. I ve always wanted to 
                    coach basketball, but Sara really 
                    hated the idea.                                                                                   12


                                  GIL
                    Well, now you re a free man. You 
                    can do anything you want. I mean, 
                    Claire never let me wear Crocs.
                          (re his foot)
                    Now, I wear  em all the time.

                                  CARTER
                    Crocs with socks?  

                                  GIL
                    My toes get cold.

                                  CARTER
                    Then wear sneakers.

                                  GIL
                    My feet sweat.

                                  CARTER
                    I don t know how she let you get 
                    away.

                                  GIL
                    Great. Even the new guy s picking 
                    on me.

                                  FRANK
                          (to Carter)
                    Love it! You re coming out of your 
                    shell, my friend!

      A pretty, 40-year old walks by. 

                                  STUART
                          (to Frank)
                    Here we go. What do you think?

                                  FRANK
                    Pass. Too much Botox. I can t even 
                    tell how old she is.

                                  CARTER
                    I can tell she s younger than you.

                                  FRANK
                    You can go back in your shell now.

                                  STUART
                          (to Carter)
                    Look, you want to coach basketball? 
                    I know the principal over at Taft.                                                                                     13


                                  CARTER
                    You d put a call in for me?

                                  STUART
                      I delivered all three of his 
                    homely, chubby girls. They re like 
                    family. Done.

                                  FRANK
                    Okay, enough chitchat, time to get 
                    young Carter back on the horse.  
                          (to Carter, re: women)
                    See anything you like?  

                                  CARTER
                    Um... I don t know. She s pretty 
                    cute, I guess.

      Carter indicates an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN across the bar. Frank 
      looks over -- oooh, not up to his standards.

                                  FRANK
                    Her? No, you re right, crawl before 
                    you walk. Go.

                                  CARTER
                    Nah, I don t have the stomach for 
                    another rejection right now.

                                  FRANK
                    It s a numbers game. You ask a 
                    hundred women to have sex. You get 
                    slapped ninety-nine times, one says 
                    yes. Dare to be great. 

                                  CARTER
                    I m not going to ask her to have 
                    sex with me.

                                  FRANK
                    Fine. One will bake muffins with 
                    you. Now go.

      Carter gathers his courage, stands, walks across the bar, 
      cautiously approaches the woman, smiles, then...

      ...walks right around her, and heads back to the guys. 

                                  STUART
                    Wow. Okay. We ve got some work in 
                    front of us.                                                                                   14


      INT. SHARK LOUNGE - NIGHT 

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    The next night, the we went out 
                    again. 

      With the guys encouraging him from a nearby booth, Carter 
      scans the crowd. A CUTE BRUNETTE approaches him.

                                  CUTE BRUNETTE
                    Hi.

                                  CARTER
                    Hi... I m Carter.

                                  CUTE BRUNETTE
                    Gaby. Um... can I get you a drink?

                                  CARTER
                    Yeah, I d like that. How about a 
                    Rolling Rock?

                                  CUTE BRUNETTE
                    Be right back.

      She heads over to the bar. Carter smugly turns to the guys.

                                  CARTER
                    See that? A pretty girl s getting 
                    me a drink.

                                  GIL
                    She s the waitress. 

                                  STUART
                    But good eye contact. We re making 
                    progress.

      ACROSS THE BAR, Carter notices Frank with his arm around an 
      adorably pretty 24-year-old. 

                                  CARTER
                    We ve been here twenty minutes. How 
                    does he get a girl like that to 
                    even give him the time of day?

                                  GIL
                    Charm. Confidence. And she s his 
                    daughter. 

                                  STUART
                    Frank won t let us near her.

      Frank and JULIE step up.                                                                                    15


                                  JULIE
                    Hi guys.

                                  GIL/STUART
                    Hey, Julie./How are you doing?

                                  JULIE
                    Good. Good...
                          (then)
                    I m sorry, I m so bad with names.

                                  FRANK
                    Gil, Stuart, and this is the new 
                    guy, Carter. His bride just dumped 
                    him at the altar.

                                  CARTER
                    Do you have to lead with that?

                                  GIL
                    It s really your defining 
                      characteristic right now.

                                  JULIE
                    Ooh. Awful. You okay?

                                  STUART
                    See? You re getting sympathy. We re 
                    going to be able to work with this.

                                  JULIE
                    Totally. You re going to clean up.

                                  FRANK
                    So what are you doing here?

                                  JULIE
                    Went to the Clippers game with some 
                    friends from work, then decided to 
                    grab a beer at what I thought was a 
                    cool place until I ran into my dad.

                                  FRANK
                    Are these girlfriends from work?

                                  JULIE
                    Yes.
                          (knowing her dad)
                    And no.
                          (then)
                    I should get back. See you.

      She kisses her dad on the cheek, then heads over to her 
      friends. The guys watch her go, all clearly a little smitten.                                                                                   16


                                  FRANK
                          (to Stuart)
                    No.
                          (to Gil)
                    No.
                          (to Carter)
                    No... Maybe... No.


      INT. GIL S CAR - NIGHT 

      Gil drives the guys home -- all eating fast food burgers.

                                  CARTER
                    This. This is what I ve been 
                    missing. I was in a relationship 
                    for so long, going to dinner 
                    parties and farmer s markets, I 
                    lost touch with my guy friends. 
                    Sara and I never went out Saturday 
                    night because we woke up early 
                    Sunday to buy organic produce. Now 
                    who the hell knows what I m putting 
                    in my stomach.

                                  FRANK
                          (mouth full)
                    Food of the Gods!

                                  GIL
                    Just keep it off the upholstery.

                                  CARTER
                    I forgot how much I love all this. 
                    Going to bars, eating burgers in 
                    the middle of the night. I m just 
                    going to say it. I love you guys. I 
                    know you think I m drunk, and I am, 
                    but I do. I love you guys. Can I 
                    say that?

                                  STUART
                    No. I m not comfortable with that.

                                  FRANK
                    Oh, loosen up. We re men and we 
                    love each other. Celebrate it.

      Yelling out the window:

                                  GIL
                    We love each other!                                                                                   17


                                  STUART
                    Next time I m taking my own car.


      INT. THE AMAZON - THE NEXT NIGHT 

      Carter, Stuart and Gil check out the action.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    The following night, we were right 
                    back out there. 

                                  CARTER
                    I think I m finally ready to meet 
                    someone.  

      Frank approaches with two ASIAN WOMEN -- a tipsy, attractive 
        fifty-year-old, and an even tipsier twenty-six-year-old.

                                  FRANK
                    Carter, there you are. This is May 
                    and her daughter, Jill.  

      As they ad-lib hellos, Frank WHISPERS in Carter s ear.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    She s a sure thing. You can thank 
                    me later.
                          (then, loud again)
                    Come on, let s let these two get to 
                    know each other.

      Frank grabs Jill, the younger woman, by the hand and 
      disappears into the crowd. May turns to Carter:

                                  MAY
                    I can teach you things.  

      As Carter ponders this...


      INT. THE OAKWOOD, POOL - DAY 

      Carter sits at a table drinking coffee and reading the paper. 
      Gil, Frank and Stuart approach.  

                                  FRANK
                    How did it go with Crouching Tiger?  
                    She beat you up pretty good?

                                  CARTER
                    Nah, couldn t go there.                                                                                     18


                                  FRANK
                    What? Why not?

                                  CARTER
                    Don t get me wrong, she was kind of 
                    hot in a weird sort of way. And we 
                    had a few drinks... it just made me 
                    miss Sara.

                                  STUART
                    We ve already got a Gil. We don t 
                    need another Gil.

                                  GIL
                    Actually, when I move back in with 
                    Claire, you might.

                                  STUART
                    Oh, my god, get him away from me.

                                  FRANK
                          (to Carter)
                    I am deeply, deeply disappointed.

                                  CARTER
                    I m sorry, but going home with a 
                      middle-aged stranger is not the 
                    answer to my problems.

                                  FRANK
                    It could take your mind off them 
                    for a little while.

                                  CARTER
                    Is everything about sex with you?

                                  FRANK
                    I also enjoy a nice steak.

                                  CARTER
                    Look, you don t get it. I lost 
                      everything. I was crazy about Sara; 
                    we just bought a house; we were 
                    going to have kids. I had a life. 
                    And now I m in temporary housing in 
                    the Sherman Oaks. 

                                  FRANK 
                    You know what I think? I think 
                    you re a little scared. I don t 
                    blame you. You ve had one 
                      girlfriend, one job you hate, never 
                    lived on your own...                                                                                    19


                                  STUART
                    Yeah, I wouldn t be so quick to 
                    call that  a life.   

                                  CARTER
                    I don t want to talk about this. 
                    You wouldn t understand. Our 
                      situations are different.

                                  STUART
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                  CARTER
                    Nothing. I shouldn t have said 
                    anything.

                                  STUART
                    No. Tell me. I d like to know.

                                  GIL
                    I don t think I need him to 
                      elaborate.

                                  CARTER
                    It s just that... I know I can fall 
                    in love again. But you guys, I m 
                    not so sure. You re all a little 
                    stuck. 

                                  STUART
                    I m not stuck. 

                                  CARTER
                    Come on, Stuart, you re so angry 
                    you can t move on. Gil, you re 
                    obviously holding on to something 
                    that s not there anymore. 

                                  GIL
                    I told you I didn t need to hear 
                    this.

                                  CARTER
                    And Frank, really? Do you honestly 
                    think you ll have a meaningful 
                      relationship with some random 
                      twenty-five year old you meet at a 
                    Jamba Juice?

                                   FRANK
                    Is she Asian?                                                                                   20


                                  STUART
                    Let s get out of here. We ve 
                    obviously been wasting our time.

                                  CARTER
                    I ll save you the trouble. I m 
                    going to the hot tub.

                                  GIL
                    We were going to go to the hot tub.

                                  CARTER
                    Fine. I ll go watch the game.

                                  GIL
                    After the hot tub, we were going to 
                    go to watch the game.

                                  CARTER
                      Ping-pong? Were you planning on 
                    playing ping-pong?

                                    GIL/FRANK/STUART
                    I don t think so./No./Go ahead.

                                  CARTER
                    Good. See you.

      Carter leaves.

                                  GIL
                    Damn. Now I feel like playing ping-
                    pong.

                                  END ACT ONE                                                                                   21


                                  ACT TWO


      EXT. THE OAKWOOD, BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

      Carter shoots hoops -- Swish, swish, swish.  

                                  CARTER (V.O.) 
                    The next few days we all kind of 
                    kept to ourselves.

      Gil approaches. The mood is a little awkward.

                                  GIL
                    You re pretty good at that. Play 
                    college ball?

                                  CARTER
                    Started for Northwestern all four 
                    years.

                                  GIL
                    I was cut from my intramural team 
                    and replaced by a really good 
                      Vietnamese girl from the dental 
                    school. Really good. Triple threat.

                                  CARTER
                    So I feel bad about the other day.

                                  GIL
                    Don t sweat it. Those other two 
                    guys can be real jerks.

      Carter laughs. 

                                  CARTER 
                    Guess what? Stuart s friend called. 
                    I ve got that coaching interview 
                    next week.

                                  GIL
                    Wow. That s--

      Carter tosses Gil the ball, which SMACKS him in the face.

                                  GIL (CONT D)
                    Ow!

                                  CARTER
                    Sorry. You re worse than I thought.                                                                                   22


                                  GIL
                    Look, I m not here to play 
                      basketball... 

      During the following, Gil s nose STARTS TO BLEED.

                                  GIL (CONT D)
                    After I messed up my marriage, 
                    which I regret every waking minute, 
                    I thought the best thing to do was 
                    give my wife lots of space, wait 
                    for her to forgive me and --  
                          (feels his nose)
                    Were you going to tell me my nose 
                    is bleeding?

                                  CARTER
                    You were on a roll.  

      Gil tilts his head back and squeezes his nose.

                                  GIL
                    The thing is, I m still waiting... 
                    Now I only see her when I pick up 
                    my daughter. If you really love 
                    Sara, don t sit around, doing 
                    nothing. That other guy made some 
                    big, grand gesture. Guess what? 
                    It s your turn -- Excuse me, I 
                    think I swallowed a little blood.


      EXT. VICTORY BLVD. - DAY 

      The car weaves through traffic. 


      INT. VOLVO STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS 

      Carter drives fast, a man on a mission -- 


      EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

      Carter fills the tank.


      INT. VOLVO STATION WAGON - DAY

      Carter drives fast again.                                                                                   23


      EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 

      The car pulls up in front of the house from the opening. With 
      a head of steam, Carter marches up the path and bangs on the 
      door. After a beat, Sara opens it.  

                                  SARA
                    Carter? What are you --

      But he blows right past her...


      INT. CARTER S OLD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 

                                  CARTER
                    I m fighting for my woman. Where is 
                    he?

      He kicks open the bedroom door, and --


      INT. CARTER S OLD HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 

                                  CARTER 
                    You and me, jackass! Right now! 

      But the bed is empty. He checks the bathroom. Also empty.

                                  SARA
                    He moved out a week ago.

      Carter sits on the bed, relieved.

                                  CARTER
                    Thank God -- he was big.

                                  SARA
                    I can t believe you re here. I ve 
                    been dying to call you but I was 
                      embarrassed. I m so sorry. I 
                    panicked. You probably hate me and 
                    I don t blame you, but being away 
                    from you made me realize I never 
                    want to be away from you again.  

      Carter takes this all in. After a beat, he stands and... 
      kisses her. It gets more and more passionate.

                                  CARTER (V.O.) 
                    I knew I wasn t like those other 
                    guys, who, at that moment...                                                                                    24

      Establishing.  

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    ...were back at the apartment 
                      complex... 

      The CAMERA PUSHES into one of the windows to find...


      INT. THE OAKWOOD, GIL S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS     

                                  CARTER (V.O.) 
                    Gil had a date with a lovely young 
                    lady.

      Gil plays checkers with his daughter, MAISIE. (NOTE: He 
      hasn t completely moved in. The only homey additions to the 
      standard set-up are photos of his family, including Claire.)

                                  MAISIE
                    Dad, when are you going to start 
                    dating again? Fiona s mom would 
                    totally go out with you.

                                  GIL
                    I m not interested. Any day now, 
                    your mother and I --

      Gil stops. Takes a deep breath. 

                                  GIL (CONT D) 
                    You know what? Why not? Maybe I ll 
                    ask her to have lunch with me.

                                  MAISIE
                    Great. She s super nice and has 
                    really big boobs.

                                  GIL
                    Or maybe dinner.


      INT. THE OAKWOOD, STUART S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

                                  CARTER (V.O.) 
                    Stuart was negotiating the terms of 
                    his divorce.

      He putts golf balls, talking on the phone. (NOTE: Stuart s 
      place is much nicer than the others -- high-end electronics, 
      art on the walls, expensive furniture, etc.)                                                                                   25


                                  STUART
                    No, I m not giving her BLEEP. I 
                    don t care if we re in court for a 
                    thousand years. So tell my first 
                    stupid BLEEPing wife to tell my 
                    second stupid BLEEPing wife to -- 

      Stuart stops. Takes a deep breath. Thinks. 

                                  STUART (CONT D)
                    Okay. Let her have the Dodgers 
                    tickets. 
                          (then)
                    But I m not giving her the BLEEPing 
                    parking pass.


      INT. THE OAKWOOD, FRANK S APARTMENT - NIGHT    

                                  CARTER (V.O.) 
                    And Frank was enjoying the company 
                    of a much younger woman.

      Frank and Jill, the babe from the previous night, make-out on 
      the couch. But then Frank stops, takes a deep breath.

                                  FRANK
                    How old are you?

                                  JILL
                      Twenty-six. Why?

      Frank thinks. Is this really appropriate? After a beat:

                                  FRANK
                    No reason.

      Frank kisses her again, starting to unbutton her blouse.  


      INT. CARTER S OLD HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT 

      ...Carter, smiling, and Sara lay in bed, post-coital.

                                  CARTER
                    You know, later, we could spice 
                    things up and try that thing--

                                  SARA
                    Not gonna happen.

                                  CARTER (V.O.) 
                          (happy)
                    My old life was back.                                                                                     26


      EXT. THE OAKWOOD, REC ROOM - DAY 

      Gil watches Stuart and Frank play Call Of Duty. On the couch 
      next to Frank... JILL texts.

                                  STUART
                    Speak of the devil.

      Carter, in the REVERSIBLE V-NECK SWEATER, and Sara approach. 

                                  CARTER
                    Hey, guys. I want you to meet Sara.

      They ad-lib hellos.

                                  GIL
                    So, things seem to be going well.

                                  CARTER
                    Yeah, we re back together. 

                                  GIL
                    Awesome. No gifts, a simple thank 
                    you will do.

                                  SARA
                    We just came by to get his stuff.

                                  CARTER
                    We re talking about picking up 
                    where we left off. Sara spoke to 
                    the country club and we can get 
                    married as early as next month.

                                  STUART
                    Great. Maybe this time you ll make 
                    it all way through the ceremony.

                                  FRANK
                    They worked it out, Stu.
                          (then)
                    I m happy for you. But I gotta be 
                    honest. Even though you said a lot 
                    of things you obviously wish you 
                    could take back... you re going to 
                    be missed around here, pal.  

                                  STUART
                    Yeah, keep in touch. Let me know if 
                    you get that coaching job.

                                  SARA
                          (to Carter)
                    What coaching job?                                                                                   27


                                  CARTER
                    Oh, I was waiting for the right 
                    time to tell you. There s a high 
                    school in Woodland Hills that s 
                    pretty interested in me. They 
                    almost made it to the play-offs 
                    last year. Lotta potential.

                                  SARA
                    But you already have a job. My 
                    dad s dying to have you back. 
                    Actually, act surprised, you re 
                    getting a promotion -- V.P. of 
                    exterior paints and sealants.

                                  CARTER
                    ...um, that s nice of him, but 
                    coaching is something I ve always 
                    dreamed of and --
                          (then)
                    You know what? Let s talk about 
                    this later.

                                  STUART
                    No, no, I m enjoying this.

                                  CARTER
                    Actually, we have to get going. 

                                  SARA
                    We re meeting another couple at the 
                    farmer s market.  

                                  STUART
                    Ooh, don t want to be late for 
                    that. The white nectarines go fast.

      Sara and Carter say goodbye and head off. 

                                  JILL
                    He s never going to call my mom, is 
                    he?


      INT. THE OAKWOOD, FRANK S APARTMENT - THREE WEEKS LATER 

      Stuart, wearing his bathrobe again, Frank and Gil, hang out 
      drinking Starbucks coffee. Gil turns to Stuart.

                                  GIL
                    For God s sake, there s a reason 
                    that thing comes with a belt.                                                                                   28


                                  STUART
                    I m getting ready to do some laps.

                                  FRANK
                    Speaking of which... Strip club?

                                  STUART
                    On Sunday morning? Really?

                                  FRANK
                    They started serving brunch. The 
                    blintzes aren t bad.

                                  STUART
                    No, how about a round of golf?

                                  FRANK
                    Alright, but we need a fourth. 
                    Should we call Carter? Haven t seen 
                    him in a while.

                                  GIL
                    He s not free. He s getting married 
                    today.

                                  FRANK
                    That s right. The ninth. Still a 
                    little miffed we weren t invited. 
                    But...
                          (raising his coffee)
                    To Carter. May he have a lifetime 
                    of happiness.

                                  STUART/GIL
                    To Carter.

      But before they can clink --

                                  GIL
                    Who are we kidding? That is not a 
                    good match.

                                  STUART
                    Cheated on him once, she ll cheat 
                    on him again.

                                  FRANK
                    Poor guy will be back here in six 
                    months.  

                                  STUART
                    You know what we need to do? We 
                    need to make a pact. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                   29

                                  STUART (CONT'D)
                    Let s not let any of us get into 
                    another crappy marriage. And yes, I 
                    know Gil, yours isn t crappy, it s 
                      wonderful.

                                  GIL
                    We have our issues.

                                  FRANK
                    Here here. To good friends. And not 
                    letting them make a horrible 
                    mistake.

      This time they clink.


      INT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - DAY 

      As in the opening -- Carter and Sara stand at the altar.  

                                  MINISTER
                    ...to be your lawfully wedded 
                      husband...

      Just then -- there s a COMMOTION in the back of the room.

                                  MALE VOICE
                    Don t do it!

                                  MINISTER
                          (to Sara)
                    How many ex-boyfriends do you have?

      But it s FRANK. 

                                  FRANK
                    I m not here for her. I m here for 
                    him.

                                  MINISTER
                          (under his breath)
                    Ay yi yi.

      Stuart and Gil rush in to find all the WEDDING GUESTS  
      staring and muttering angrily. The guys talk sotto voce.

                                  GIL
                    They re all looking at us.

                                  STUART
                    I know, say something.

                                  FRANK
                    I already did. You say something.                                                                                   30


                                  GIL
                    I told you we should have written 
                    stuff down.

      Frank spots an ATTRACTIVE ASIAN wedding guest.

                                  FRANK 
                    Hi, Frank Russo.

                                  GIL
                          (to Carter)
                    Look, I know we probably could have 
                    timed this better, and we haven t 
                    even known you that long, but... is 
                    this really what you want? 

                                  SARA
                    Carter, these guys are ruining our 
                    wedding.

                                  CARTER
                    Maybe if you let me invite them 
                    instead of your weird cousins from 
                    Canada --
                          (to weird cousins)
                    Thanks for the killer maple syrup, 
                    by the way.
                          (back to Sara)
                    -- we wouldn t have this problem.

                                  SARA
                    Are you taking their side?

                                  CARTER
                    Of course not. And this obviously 
                    isn t the best way to do it, but 
                    they re just making sure I m doing 
                    the right thing.

                                  SARA
                    Do you have concerns?

                                  CARTER
                    No, I don t have concerns.

                                  MINISTER
                    I have concerns.

                                  CARTER
                    It s just that -- and I ve tried to 
                    tell you -- but what s wrong with 
                    the produce at Ralphs? 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                   31

                                  CARTER (CONT'D)
                    It s reasonably priced, it s open 
                    24-hours, they have a great 
                      selection. Ralphs is America s 
                      supermarket.

                                  SARA
                    Why are we talking about Ralphs?

                                  CARTER
                    You re right, it s not about 
                    Ralphs. Forget Ralphs. If I m being 
                    honest, I prefer Vons. It s... your 
                    obsession about things being 
                      reversible. Just once I d like a 
                    green sweater and a blue sweater. 
                    Not a greenblue sweater. That s 
                    still not what I m trying to say. 
                    It s me. I m the thing that s not 
                      reversible. You can t take me off, 
                    turn me inside out and suddenly, 
                    I m a industrial paint kind of guy. 
                    I m not. I m a basketball coach. 
                    And we re getting married. I need 
                    to know you re on my side.  

                                  SARA
                    What, you want a job where you can 
                    wear shorts to work? That s what 
                    this is all about. 

                                  CARTER
                    Did you not hear a word I said?

                                  SARA
                    It s like you ve been brainwashed 
                    by these... idiots you ve known two 
                    months.   

                                  FRANK
                    Just so you know, the acoustics are 
                    really good in here.

                                  CARTER
                    I ve known you ten years, but they 
                    seem to get what s important to me.

                                  SARA
                    This is ridiculous. Kick them out 
                    already. Do you really want to 
                    throw your life away?

      After a long beat:                                                                                   32


                                  CARTER
                    No, Sara. No, I don t.  


      EXT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - DAY 

      SLOW MOTION. Carter, with a big grin on his face, bursts out 
      into the sunlight, followed by the guys.  

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    In case you re keeping track. That 
                    look on my face is the last 
                    stage... acceptance.

                                  GIL
                    Why are we running?

                                  STUART
                    No idea.


      EXT. THE OAKWOOD, POOL - DAY 

      Carter, Gil, Frank and Stuart recline on lounge chairs, 
      checking out the ladies.

                                  GIL
                    Two o clock. Red bathing suit.

      The others sneak a peak.  

                                  CARTER
                    The chubby guy with the hairy back?

                                  GIL
                    Okay, more like 2:30, quarter to 3.

      Now they spot her.

                                  FRANK
                    Pass. Too young. Even I have 
                    scruples.

                                  STUART
                    Not pretty enough for you?

                                  FRANK
                    Not even for a weeknight.

      Frank s daughter, Julie, approaches.

                                  JULIE
                    Hey guys.                                                                                   33


      They all say hi, still smitten, as Frank gathers his stuff.

                                  JULIE (CONT D)
                          (she likes him)
                    Carter, right?

                                  CARTER
                          (he likes her)
                    Yeah. You remembered...

                                  FRANK
                    Ready to go eat?

                                  JULIE
                    Let s do it. See you around.

      Frank and Julie head off. But then he turns back to Carter.

                                  FRANK
                    No.

      Carter smiles. There s an upside to being single. 

                                  END OF SHOW*
