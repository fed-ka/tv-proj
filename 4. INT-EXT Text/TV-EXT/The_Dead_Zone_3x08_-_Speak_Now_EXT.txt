          We hear WEDDING BAND music as a tipsy Bruce, in a tux,
          bow tie askew, comes tumbling out of a door marked
            BALLROOM, a pretty but drunk and slightly disheveled
          BRIDESMAID tugging at his arm. 

                                        BRIDESMAID
                                (flirty)
                        Where do you think you're going? 
                        You promised to Macarena with me.

          She dances closer, presses her hips against his
            suggestively.

                                        BRUCE
                        Things were getting a little too
                        hot in there.  I need a second to
                        cool off.

          The Bridesmaid laughs, takes Bruce's face in her hands,
          plants a wet one right on his mouth.  Bruce, caught off
          guard, resists for a beat, then starts to give in.  Just
          as it heats up, he feels a tap on his shoulder, turns and
          BAM!  He gets punched in the face by an ANGRY HUSBAND,
          wedding band gleaming as his fist strikes Bruce's jaw.
          Bruce goes down hard, then looks up from the floor.

                        No disrespect, man.  She told me
                        she was a widow!



          Johnny is crouched in some bushes, there's something about
          his body language that's hostile, furtive.  He's spying
          into the backyard at

          MARIA

          As she sets a pitcher of lemonade out on a picnic table.

                                        MARIA
                          Brianna!  Alec!

          As Alec comes out and they kiss, Johnny looks down to see
          his fingers close involuntarily into an angry fist.



          Walt and Johnny follow Sarah as she leads them to Bryan's
          gravesite, filling them in on what she knows.

                                        SARAH
                        Maria, Alec and Bryan were all
                          friends, doctors at the hospital
                        here.  When that terrible
                        earthquake hit Uzbekistan in 2001,
                        they volunteered to help Doctors
                        for Peace.

                                        WALT
                                (nods)
                          I didn't really know them back
                        then, but what I heard was it was
                          supposed to be a two-week trip
                        just to do triage.  Only it turned
                        out to be in a very dangerous
                        region.  The village where they
                        were posted was attacked by rebels. 
                        Maria and Alec survived.

                                        SARAH
                        Bryan didn't.

                                        WALT
                        He was murdered by the rebels.

                                        SARAH
                        Maria was devastated... and about
                        a year later, Alec's wife died
                          suddenly.  Breast cancer.  They
                        gave each other comfort... which
                        eventually turned into love.

                        It was a small funeral.  All they
                        had to bury were a few personal
                          effects.

          ON GRAVE MARKER, name and date etched in marble: Bryan
          Taylor Hampton, 1970 - 2001. 

          FRESH FLOWERS have been placed at the grave.  Johnny leans
          down to touch them, triggering:          DEAD ZONE: SPEAK NOW - ACT TWO - 3/30/04 - YELLOW     19.



          Maria lays the fresh flowers at the grave, MORPHS INTO:



          Johnny watches as Maria, Alec and Bryan are operating on
          a CHILD in a semi-destroyed building.  Suddenly they hear
          shouts and then shooting as through a break in the wall
          they see battered Toyota pickup trucks full of GUERILLA
          SOLDIERS roll into the village.



          Maria, Alec and Bryan are dragged out of the building by
          the guerrillas.

                                        MARIA
                        No!  No!  We are doctors!  Here
                        to help!

          Maria and Alec are dragged off in one direction, another
          guerilla jabs a gun into Bryan's back and motions him to
          go in the opposite direction.

                                        MARIA
                                (voice shaking)
                        Bry...

          Bryan turns and yells over his shoulder.

                                        BRYAN
                        Alec, get her out of here!

          The Guerrilla kicks Bryan, drags him into a burned out
          structure.

                                        MARIA
                        No, Bryan!  Bryan!

          We hear SHOTS.  Johnny flinches.

                                        MARIA
                          Noooooo! 



          Johnny moves to the grave.

                        his personal effects?

                        That's just it, Sarah.  He wasn't
                        killed that day.  The rebels faked
                        his death.  My vision was in the
                          present.  Bryan's alive.

                        He's being held captive by some
                        rebels, forced to patch up their

                        In your vision of the future, he
                        was missing an arm.

                        We gotta get him out.  Now.  One
                        of the rebels said they were

                        My contact at Doctors for Peace
                        says the State Department's looking
                        into it.  They've had some dealings
                        with the Uzbeki rebel faction in
                        the area where you saw Bryan.

                        Maybe if we get Bryan home sooner,
                        he won't be so damaged.  Maybe
                        Maria should wait for him.

                        So we're agreed?  Until we know

                        of us.  Last thing we need is a

          JOHNNY watches Bruce, who's down on one knee, with an
          engagement ring in his hand in front of an over-the-moon
          Nicole.  Bruce slips it on her finger, tears of joy stream
          down her face.  As Nicole throws her arms around him --



          There's a knock at the door.  Maria, still in her wedding
          dress, opens it to find --

          She's angry, distraught.

                        down like this? 

          He follows Maria into the house, sees she's hauled out a
          box of Bryan's things.  Newspaper articles, some clothes,
          letter announcing his death.

                        All I had left of Bryan.

          Johnny's phone rings.  He picks it up.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (into phone)
                        Hello?  Yes, I'm with her now.
                                (nods)
                        As soon as I hang up.  Thanks,
                        Gene.

          He flips his phone shut, looks at Maria.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Reverend Purdy just got a call
                        from the State Department. 
                          There've been rumors about an
                          American doctor working for the
                        rebels against his will.  Until
                        now, the government thought they
                        were just that.  Rumors.  They're
                        sending in a rescue team as we
                        speak.

          Johnny moves to the box, takes out a letter from the State
            Department...





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SPEAK NOW - ACT FOUR - 3/30/04 - YELLOW    51.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reads)
                        "We regret to inform you..."

          Clipped to the letter is Bryan's burned and blood-stained
          I.D. placard, like you hand around your neck for "Doctors
          for Peace," which triggers --



          Johnny watches as Bryan, on the ground, in worn and blood-
          stained medical scrubs, runs from the GUERRILLAS.  He is
          surrounded by U.S. SOLDIERS, guns drawn, who create a
          shield around him.  The REBELS scatter as the SOLDIERS
          shoot in their direction, pulling Bryan towards a waiting
          Humvee.  Just as they're about to board, there's a scuffle,
          A REBEL comes straight at them, gun held high, takes aim
          at Bryan.  As the Rebel's about to shoot, he's knocked
          back by the force of the Rescuers' bullets taking him
          out.


          CONTINUOUS

          The soldiers jump into the moving vehicle, reach for Bryan. 
          One of them grabs his right hand.  But his arm's badly
          wounded, and the searing pain makes him let go.  Still
          under fire, they start to drive off, Bryan's in danger of
          being left behind when suddenly he reaches out his other
          hand, his good arm, and --

            A soldier grabs it, pulling him to safety.  As Bryan falls
          into the Humvee, REVEAL Johnny sitting on the seat next
          to him.

                                                                                BACK TO:



          Maria, in a more simple wedding dress than before, and
          Bryan, looking more like his old self -- clean-shaven and
            healthier -- in a nice suit, stand next to each other,
          GUESTS assembled.  After a long shared look, Bryan walks
          her forward to where Purdy stands.  Then he --





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SPEAK NOW - ACT FOUR - 3/17/04 - WHITE     53.


    53CONTINUED:53

          STEPS AWAY

          and Maria turns to face her groom -- Alec, flower girl
          Brianna between them, beaming.  Walt, Sarah, Bruce --
          they're all there.  Not a dry eye in the house.  Bryan
          crosses in, stands next to Johnny, who acknowledges him
          with a sympathetic nod.

                                        PURDY
                        Into this holy estate these three
                        persons present come now to be
                        joined.  If any one can show just
                        cause why they may not lawfully
                        be joined together, let him speak
                        now, or forever hold his peace.


          FIND JOHNNY

          in the audience.  His eyes meet Sarah's, and they share a
          sad smile.

                                        PURDY
                        And now, Maria, in lieu of
                          traditional vows, would like to
                        speak from her heart.

                                        MARIA
                        Alec, we've traveled many miles --
                          together, and separately -- to
                        get here.  The road's had many
                        twists and turns, sometimes it
                        even felt like d j  vu ...

          They and the audience smile.

                                        MARIA
                        But here we are, standing side by
                        side.  I'm ready to start our
                        life together, as a wife...
                                (takes Brianna's hand)
                        ...and a mother.  And although
                        it's taken a long time to get
                        here, it was worth the journey,
                        because I'm finally exactly where
                        I want to be.  At home.

          On Maria and Alec -- this is their happily ever after.

                                                                    TIME DISSOLVE TO:          DEAD ZONE: SPEAK NOW - ACT FOUR - 3/25/04 - PINK      54.
