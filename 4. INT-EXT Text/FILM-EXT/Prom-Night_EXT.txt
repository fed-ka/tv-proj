SUPER: April 27, 1973
All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny
Friday afternoon. Cars idle in the driveway awaiting
the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children.
Two faded yellow buses stand ready.
The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL.
A swarm of children pours out the door and down the
broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward
the cars and the buses.
Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND,
nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway..
Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub-
dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the
stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a
girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old,
two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in
school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM
HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister.
ALEX
C'mon, Robin.
ROBIN
(STUTTERING BADLY)
W-w-where's D-d-daddy?
ALEX
He's got a meeting at the high
school. We're supposed to walk
home with Kim...
(sees Robin watching
the young couple)
She's too busy. Let's go
by ourselves.
ROBIN
N-n-n-no, Alex. Let's w-w-wait.
ALEX
Why?
Robin is staring at Nick. Alex looks, understands.
He's angry.
ALEX
(CONTINUING)
You're crazy, I'm not waiting.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED :
He strides away. Robin's eyes remain on Nick and Kim.
Nick says something to Kurt. She shakes her head and
pains toward Robin. Robin quickly turns away as they
look at her.. When she glances back, Ki_m is walking
towards her and Nick is bicycling away.
KIM
Okay, let's go.
The sisters start to walk across the lawn.
ROBIN
Y-you 1-1-like him?
KIM
Who?
ROBIN
(SMILES SHYLY)
Y-you know.
KIM
Nick? Oh, he's all right, I guess.
They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at
her big sister.
ROBIN
(FINALLY)
Are y-y-you g-gonna m-in-marry him?
KIM
Robin?
Robin smiles and takes Kim's hand. They walk along the
road, kicking rocks and swinging their bookbags. Sud-
denly Kim halts.
KIM
(CONTINUING)
Oh, damn!
Robin looks up in surprise.
KIM
(CONTINUING)
Debbie was gonna lend me her new
record. Look, you go on home
by yourself. Tell Mom I'll be
a little late.
Before Robin can reply, Kim is hurrying away.

Robin watches her go, then moves off alone, breaking
into a skip and playing imaginary hopscotch.
As she turns off the main road into a side street,
Robin passes a construction site. The empty skeleton
of a half-finished apartment building looms up above
the dark shade trees. Hearing VOICES, Robin stops to
investigate.
ROBIN
(CALLS OUT)
Alex?
The VOICES continue. Robin moves closer, peering
through the tall bushes surrounding the lot. She
sees Nick playing in.the framework with three of his
classmates. Robin recognizes JUDE CUNNINGHAM, and
KELLY LYNCH as Kim's two best friends. The fourth
child, WENDY RICHARDS, is a dark-haired girl, domin-
eering and loud. As Robin watches, Wendy jumps
up onto the floor of the building.
WENDY
I want to play 'Murder.' Who's
the killer?
NICK
You, Wendy!
JUDE
(GIGGLING)
you, Nick.
KELLY
Yes, Nick!
WENDY
(LAUGHING)
You'll never catch me. Hide your
eyes, killer!
As Nick turns his back, hiding his eyes against an ex-
posed beam, the children scatter through the structure.
Robin watches with mounting excitement as Nick finishes
counting, and whirls around.
NICK
The killer is coming for you!
He moves into the building, chanting "Kill, kill.," in a
low monotone. As he disappears from view, Robin cau-
tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the
building.
NICK (O.S.
The killer strikes!
(CONTINUED)

Robin hears Jude's SQUEAL of LAUGHTER. Nick has caught
her. Immediately Jude's VOICE TAKES UP the "kill"
chant in unison with Nick.
A Police Officer is getting out of his car. Walking
around to the passenger side, he opens the door
for an attractive blonde woman in her mid-thirties.
VIVIAN HANMOND, Robin's mother, appears pale and
haggard as she steps out of the car. Kim and Alex
slowly climb out of the back, With the Police Officer
escorting her, Vivian and her children move toward
the skeleton of a building.
Catching sight of her husband framed in a lower window,
Vivian suddenly breaks. away from the Police Officer and
runs inside the building.
The Hammonds' car pulls up in front of a towering
modern building.
Alex jumps out of the car and opens the door for his
mother. Taking her arm, he helps her out. Kim leans
over in the back seat.
KIM
See you later,'Mom.
Vivian gives her a thin smile. Hammond takes her arm
and leads her into the imposing building.
15.
The CAR SCREECHES to a halt inches away from the terri-
fied child who stands frozen in the middle of the
crossing. After a moment, realizing she is safe, the
girl giggles nervously and skips away.
Hammond, Kim and Alex walk through the empty lot
towards the school. Suddenly, we HEAR a loud GRATING
SOUND coming from nearby. The sudden noise startles
Kim and she huddles against her father.
A seedy little middle-aged man with a stubble of gray
beard appears from behind a row of bushes, brandishing
a pair of electric hedge clippers.
HANMMMOND
Good morning, Mr. Sykes.
SANFORD SYKES, the newly-hired custodian, bares his
yellow teeth in a crooked grin and waves the whirring
blades in salute. Kim shudders and stays close to
her father as they walk on.
KIM
He's creepy.
ALEX
I heard he's wacko.
HAIIOND
The man is not... wacko.
KIM
Kelly says he's a pervert, spying
on the girls undressing in the
locker room.
HAIIOND
Sykes may have some problems, but
he's no Peeping Tom. He's been
thoroughly checked out.

They climb the broad front steps of the high school.
Hammond glances at his watch.
HAMNIOND
(CONTINUING)
You're early today. Plenty of
time to study with no one to
bother you.
Kim reaches up.and kisses her father on the cheek.
Pulling out a fashion magazine, she rushes off, call-
ing back over her shoulder.
KIM
I'.ve got to decide on my hair
style for tonight.
HAMMOND
(WRYLY)
Wonderful. Alex?
ALEX
I'm building an atomic bomb in
shop.
Smiling, he moves inside. Hammond shakes his head
and hurries off.
The expansive residence sits back off the road in this
upper-middle-class suburb. Wendy climbs into her
white Mustang and starts the engine. TIRES SQUEALING,
she ROARS out of the driveway with the RADIO BLASTING.
The small house appears almost identical to the other
dwellings in this lower-middle-class neighborhood. Jude
pulls an apple from her large purse, munching while
she walks to the bus stop.
A gaudily-painted van pulls up alongside her. The win-
dow slowly rolls down and a young curly-haired GUY
wearing glasses sticks out his head.
GUY
Hey, beautiful, need a lift?
Jude continues walking, the van moving slowly alongside
her.
JUDE
No thanks.
GUY
C'mon, I won't bite.
Jude chomps down hard on her apple.
JUDE
So who are you?
TheGuy leans further out the window.
GUY
Seymour Stone but..
He's cut short as the van bounces up onto the sidewalk.
Jude shrieks. The flustered boy steers the van quickly
back onto the road.
(CONTINUED)

GUY
(CONTINUING)
but they call me Slick!
Jude laughs, almost choking on her apple.
JUDE
I can see why... How old are you,
Slick?
GUY (SLICK)
Old enough...
JUDE
I've heard about guys like you...
running over girls on the sidewalk...
SLICK
Just some girls... If they're good
lookin' I give 'em a ride.
JUDE
(SMILING)
Can you stop that thing?
Slick jams on the brakes. The van jerks to a halt.
He opens the passenger door.
JUDE
(CONTINUING)
I'm going straight to Winston High,
understand?
SLICK
(NODS)
Straight to Winston.
She climbs inside.
The van weaves through the parked cars, passing up
several vacant spots. It finally SCREECHES to a halt
at the far end of the lot near some high bluffs over-
looking a lake.
Kim and Vicki are sprawled on the grass eating lunch.
Lou storms down the front steps. Pausing at the bottom,
he turns, strolls over to Kim.
LOU
Watch for me, little girl. You
know I'm just a kiss away.
Lou laughs and walks off toward the parking lot. Kim
shudders.
Wendy's white Mustang slides up to the curb. The pass-
enger window rolls down and Lou leans over to look in-
side. After a moment he climbs in and the MUSTANG
PEELS out of the lot, leaving twin black tread marks in
its wake.
KIM
What a pair!
VICKI
Made for each other!
Kim opens a carton of yogurt.
KIM
You wearing that green gown tonight?
VICKI
You kidding? That was last year.
This year... red silk!
(smiles and runs her
hand from her neck
to her waist)
Cut to here! ...
NICK (O.S.)
Cut to where?
Kim and Vicki turn to see Nick ambling across the lawn
toward them.
VICKI
(MOCK-SEDUCTIVELY)
Anywhere you like...
KIM
(SMILING)
On the prowl!
Wendy's white Mustang streaks through traffic, dodging
in and out of lanes, running yellows, burning around
corners.
The Mustang suddenly slows down and makes a hard left
turn, narrowly beating a horn-honking oncoming van.
The big white car bounces up over the curb and sweeps
into the end slot at a sprawling fast-food drive-in.
A WIDE VIEW; high weather-worn bluffs tumbling down to
a strip of beach and the calm blue waters of the lake.
Above the bluffs there's a narrow shaded park and then
the buildings and parking lots of Winston High.
63 CONTINUED:
Nick and Kim walk slowly along the rim of the bluffs.
Nick has his arm around her. She leans into him.
KIM
I am excited, it's just... in some
ways it's such an awful day... It's
Robin's day...
KIM
My mother's all upset, as usual.
My father too... he doesn't show
it so much... It's hard to get
over something like that. Robin
would have been a junior, like
Alex. This would've been her first
prom... I guess that's'why it seems
so much worse this year...
She stops, turns and faces Nick. It's hard for him to
meet her gaze.
KIM
(CONTINUING)
The Queen of the Prom is determined
not to let it get to her... She
must maintain her... whatever, at all
costs..
She tries a weak smile. Nick stares at her, then sud-
denly takes her, pulls her to him, embraces her. She's
caught by surprise, but she responds.
She smiles.
KIN
I love you too.
Di.
64 CONTINUED: 64
NICK
I'm... I want you to know that...
Robin's death... I remember it and
I've always been... so sorry
about it...
Kim looks puzzled.
NICK
(CONTINUING)
I mean... I know what you're
feeling... I've...
(looks at her)
:Listen I...
Across the school parking lot a CAR HORN BLARES, inter-
rupts Nick. Kim reacts.
KIM
That's my father... I've got to go,
Okay?
NICK
Yeah... I'll see you later.
She hesitates a moment, then kisses him quickly, turns
and goes. Nick looks shaken up. He stares after her
as she hurries away.
Behind Nick, in the other corner of the parking lot, a
metal door slides open, loud RAUNCHY ROCK and ROLL sud-
denly infests the air. Nick turns, sees Jude climbing
out of Slick's van. Jude looks about as stoned as she
can get. She spots Nick, waves.
JUDE
Hey, Nick!
Nick turns and heads the other way.
There's a small marble headstone inset with the carved
face of an angel and the inscription "Robin Anne Hammond
1964 - 1973 Too Soon Taken From Us."
Kneeling beside the grave is Vivian Hammond. She's ar-
ranging a large bouquet of mixed flowers, fussing with
them, trying for some kind of impossible perfection.
HP`MOND (0. S.
We have to go, Vi.
(CONTINUED)

65 CONTINUED: 65
She doesn't react, she keeps playing with the flowers.
Hammond moves in behind her, puts his hands on her
shoulders. She looks at him.
HAMMOND
(CONTINUING)
We have to get back.
She stands, with her husband's support. Kim and Alex
are standing quietly at the foot of the grave. Vivian
looks at them both. Her eyes hold a terrible rage, a
terrible sadness. Hammond carefully guides her away.
Kim has a flower of her own, a white rose, which she
drops on her sister's grave. She turns, meets Alex's
stare, moves off after her parents. Alex remains a mo-
ment longer, then. he, too, goes.
During the afternoon phys. ed. class, the girls play
tennis: Kim with Kelly and Vicki with Jude. Sykes
lingers nearby, watching the girls. Their instructor
is Miss HENRI-ANNE BENTON, a stocky woman in her late
thirties with teased, lacquered hair. A product of
genteel Southern womanhood, Henri-Anne stalks the
courts in her baggy Bermuda shorts, constantly blowing
a silver whistle hanging from her neck.
A very stoned, giggling Jude runs Vicki ragged, hitting
balls over the fence, straight up in the air and occa-
sionally even back over her head. Each time a ball
flies over the fence, Vicki runs to retrieve it to the
delight of Sykes.
At one point, Vicki bends over to pick up a ball under
Sykes' appreciative gaze. The shrill WHISTLE inter-
rupts her as Henri-Anne rushes over.
HENRI-ANNE
(SOUTHERN ACCENT)
No, no, Miss Cantrell! Never bend
from the waist... Squat!
(DEMONSTRATES)
Always squat to retrieve.
Otherwise, you look like the broad
side of a barn!
(glares at Sykes)
Isn't that so, Mr. Sykes?
Embarrassed, the custodian scuttles away to the girls'
Laughter.
66 CONTINUED: 66
HENRI-ANNE
(CONTINUING)
That's enough for today, ladies.
We don't want you all worn out for
the ball tonight.
Kim, Jude and Kelly gather'around with the other girls.
JUDE
(GIGGLING)
Ball?
KIM
Shhh!
Kelly takes Jude aside as Kim and Vicki approach Henri
Anne.
KIM
(CONTINUING;
WHISPERS)
You sure she likes Weller?
VICKI
Positive. I heard her say she's
had the hots for him since they
met!
KIM
She said that?
VICKI
Well, not exactly.
HENRI-ANNE
Oh, Kim. You'll be in the gym
promptly at three-fifteen for
rehearsal?
KIM
Well, actually no, Miss Benton.
can't make it... You know Mr.
Weller?
HENRI-ANNE
We're... acquainted.
KIM
He.. umm..
VICKI
(BLURTS OUT)
He's got a crush on Kim!

Kim stares in amazement aL Vicki;
HENRI --ANNE
(staring at Kim)
He has what?
Kim, wide-eyed, can only look at Vicki.
VICKI
He keeps making Kim stay after
school in detention study hall for
no reason... Just so he can be
near her.
HENRI-ANNE
That's horrible!
Kim gulps.
HENRI-ANNE
(CONTINUING)
You mean to tell me that awful man
A girl half his age!
(a very slight
SMILE)
So you have detention this
afternoon?
Kim nods meekly. Lost in thought, Henri-Anne fondles a
tennis ball, a curious smile playing across her face.
HENRI-ANNE
(CONTINUING;
FINALLY)
Leave everything to me...
She hurries away. Kim turns on Vicki and starts to
protest.
VICKI
(INTERRUPTING)
It worked, didn't it?
Kim and Vicki, and behind them, Jude and Kelly are
walking back to the gym and the dressing rooms from the
tennis courts. Vicki's in high spirits and Jude still
can't stop giggling.
Vicki spots old Sykes heading out toward the playing
field. She calls out to him.

VICKI
Mr. Sykes!
KIM
Vicki, don't...
VICKI
Oh, Mr. Sykes...
Sykes stops, turns around.
VICKI
(CONTINUING)
This is just for you...
She turns, bends over, quickly yanks down her shorts
and moons him. There's a squeal of laughter from Jude
and from Kelly. Vicki whips her shorts back up and
runs to the gym door, the other girls in pursuit.
Kim looks back at Sykes. He's just standing in the
field, not moving. There's a look in his eyes.
Kim opens the outside door, peers down the walkway to
the tennis courts, playing fields. There's no sign of
anyone. She closes the door.
The split-level suburban residence sits on a tree-lined
street in an older, middle-class neighborhood. Walking
up the driveway, Kim hears a LOUD THUD from behind the
house. As the SOUND CONTINUES, Kim walks around back
to investigate.
Stepping around the corner of the house, Kim sees her
father furiously chopping an old stump in the flower
garden.

Hammond's axe slashes into the rotten wood, sending
splinters flying in all directions. Kim watches him
work. He appears angry and upset.
KIM
Hi.
Oblivious, Hammond buries the axe in the stump. Kim
moves around to face him. When he sees her, Hammond
jumps, startled.
HAMMOND
I didn't hear you.
KIM
(SMILES)
Sorry.
Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Hammond struggles
to catch his breath.
HAMMOND
I'm getting too old for this.
KIM
Why are you doing it now?
HAMMOND
Your mother's been hounding me to
get it done... You got nay message?
KIM
(PUZZLED)
No.
HAMMOND
(ANGRILY)
I told that woman to tell you I
had a meeting and couldn't drive
you home.
KIM
Your secretary?
HAMMOND
(NODS)
Idiot!
KIM
I liked her.
Hammond angrily jerks the axe from the stump.

You okay?
HA` ONND
(SHRUGS)
This thing with your mother...
Have you seen her yet?
KIM
No. How is she?
HAMMOND
(SIGHS)
One minute she's depressed, the
next she's bubbling over like a
child... She wants to go with me
tonight.
KIM
Great!
HAMMOND
I'm not so sure.
KIM
I think getting dressed up and
going out might be good for her.
HA",24OND
She's had a bad day, Kim. I'm not
sure she can handle it... See if
you can talk to her.
Hammond picks up the axe and sends it crashing into the
stump.
Hammond takes Vivian's arm as they step outside, walk
toward the car in the driveway.
Hammond guides his wife to their family car, opens the
passenger door for her_ He looks past her, down the
street, sees a car parked there.

98 CONTINUED: 98
A streetlight reflecting off its windshield prevents
him from seeing inside. Vivian interrupts his
speculations.
VIVIAN
I'm going back to change.
She turns back to the house. Hammond holds on to her
arm.
HAMMOND
Vi... there's no time...
VIVIAN
I'm not going to look ridiculous!
IAMMOND
You don't look ridiculous, you
look fine...
Hammond takes Vivian by the shoulders, faces her.
HAMMON D
Vi.. this is a big night for the
school, it's a big night for me...
I know how you're feeling... I
understand... It's difficult for
all of us... But we've got to make
a special effort, Vi... We can't
let the... terrible memories of
this day affect us... That may
seem cold and... insensitive to
you, but it's the way it has to
be..
He pauses, staring down at his wife. She's holding his
gaze.
HAMMOND
(CONTINUING)
Now, Vi, if you think it's going
to be too difficult for you...
VIVIAN
You don't want me to go.

HARMOND
No! I don't... believe me..
VIVIAN
Then why are you saying these
things?
HAMMMOND
Vi... I just..
He's trying to stay calm, to keep the lid on. She's on
the verge of tears.
HAMMOND
(CONTINUING)
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to
upset you...
VIVIAN
You treat me like a child! I'm
your wife!
She glares at him. He releases her from his grip, ges-
tures toward the car.
HANMOND
Let's get going...
He walks around to the driver's door. Vivian stares
after him with hard cold eyes.
The figure climbs out of his car, gazes at the fading
taillights of the Hammond car. The figure is Nick
McBride.
