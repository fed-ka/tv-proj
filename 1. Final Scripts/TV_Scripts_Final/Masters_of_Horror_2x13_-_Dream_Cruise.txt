A child's cap drops with a SPLASH over the side of the boat. 

 

2   EXT. ON THE OCEAN 

The baseball cap floats on the high seas. 

The hand of a young boy - SEAN, age 8 - extends to grab the hat. 

His elder brother - JACK (JOHN PATRICK MILLER), age 10 -watches and warns: 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Don't lean over... 

 

                                        SEAN 

                          I'm okay. 

. 

Sean leans forward without thinking, really wanting that hat. 

 

                                        JACK 



                                          3   


                          Sean! Sean! Stop it. Sean!  

The boat tips sideways. M2 

                                                                                              ) 
Jack overcompensates and the boat capsizes. (393

The boys are thrown into the water. 

Sean desperately seeks help from his big brother. 

Jack reaches out for his little brother. 


                                        JACK 

                          Calm down, Sean. Grab my arm! Sean! 


Jack lends assistance grabbing Sean by the arm. 

But Sean's in a panic. He clings to Jack, his sudden terror making him thrash wildly, forcing him 

under the water. 

Jack barely  manages to  grab  the side of the capsized boat with his free hand, trying to  keep it 

steady and help his little brother. 


                                        SEAN 

                          Jack help me! 


From  the  shock  of  almost  being  drowned,  Jack  loosens  his  grip  for  an  instant  and  Sean's  arm 

slips free. 


                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Sean! 

 

Sean sinks into the murky water. 


(FLASH ) 

Jack, now age 35, wakes up. 






                                          4   


We see Sean s face as he drops down into the depths, eyes and mouth wide in a silent scream, 

which struggles to the surface in a bubble. 

3   INT. JACK'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING, THE PRESENT DAY 

Jack springs up in bed as if he's been dreaming. 

He's in a cold sweat.

He starts to wash his face but then stops cold. 

A cap is floating in the sink. M3 

Jack shuts his eyes. After taking some deep breaths, he slowly opens his eyes. 

The cap is gone.

With an expression of relief, he goes back to washing his face. 

In that instant, the hand of a young boy shoots out of the water and grabs hold of Jack's face. 

 

5   EXT. ROWBOAT 

Jack wakes up in real time, springing to attention. 

As he looks around, the ocean stretches out around him for miles.

Jack realizes that he's awakened not in bed but in a rowboat. 

A baseball cap floats on the surface right beside the boat. 

Jacks slowly reaches out his hand to grab the hat. 

Then, something suddenly grabs onto him from behind. 

It's Sean, his face as pale as a ghost s. 

Jack reacts.

He's in a cold sweat. 



                                          6   


He sits on the bed with an expression of anguish. 

His cell phone RINGS. 

He grabs the phone peering at the LCD screen. 

The caller ID screen reads: Yuri. 

He answers the phone.

                          What are you doing up so early?

                                          7   


Jack goes out to the balcony.  
Silence on the line.

                          Something's not right. 

 

Worry crosses Jack s face. 


                                        JACK 

                          What did he say?

                          I had a last-minute meeting I couldn t get out of it. 

                          It was too late to call.

                          I need to see you, soon. 

 

Jack s face darkens with guilt. 


                                        JACK 

                          I  will call you.

HARRISON, the branch manager, is waiting for Jack. 

Jack comes.  

Harrison hands Jack a file.

                          Got a little fire for you to put out. Eiji Saito is about 

                          to get sued for contract default by several corporations. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          God, damn it Eiji.  Do they have a case? 

 

Jack peruses the materials.

                          I don t want it to get that far.  If this gets dragged into court, 

                          we'll be the ones on the wrong side of the law. 

                          Go see the guy and figure something out. 

 


                                        JACK 

                          Okay. I will do. 

 


Jack looks troubled.

                          Something wrong? 

 

                                        JACK

                          Jack, handle this with complete discretion. Saito is 

                          a valuable client. And you're the only one who could 

                          wrangle him up. I don t wanna see you in a straight jacket  

                          like your overpaid Harvard University predecessor. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          You don't have to worry about me big guy. 

                          I will do whatever it takes, okay? 

 

                                      HARRISON 

                                        (smiles) 

                          That s what I would like to hear.

                                        JACK 

                          Okay. 


Jacks goes out the room.. 


12  INT. LAW OFFICE, JACK'S OFFICE 

Jack is on the phone. 


                                        JACK

Jack hangs up the land line phone. 

Jack stands and stares out the window. 

He looks a photo by the window.  M5

It's a picture from a party given at Saito's home. EIJI SAITO has his arm around Jack's shoulder. (293

YURI SAITO, his wife, stands next to them. 

The signed photo reads: To Jack, my best partner, from Eiji Saito. 

The VOICE of Jack's assistant breaks the silence. 


                                      ASSISTANT 

                          Jack. Mr. Saito is on line three for you. 


                                        JACK 

                                (picking up the phone) 

                          Eiji, where are you? 

                          I ve been trying to track you down all morning. 

 



                                          12   


                                      EIJI (O.C.) 

                          I know all about the situation. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Let s get together in my office. We can talk about it. 

 

                                      EIJI (O.C.) 

                          I can't. I'm taking my boat out this afternoon. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          I hardly think this the time for a pleasure cruise. 

 

                                      EIJI (O.C.) 

                          I'm at the Yumehama Marina. Come on over, we can talk here. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          No you should probably came down here --  

 

But Eiji has already hung up the phone. 


13 EXT. THE STREET IN FRONT OF JACK'S OFFICE 

Jack goes out office. 

He finds a taxi. 

                                        JACK 

                                               Hey ! Taxi! 

 

He flags down an approaching taxi. 


                                        JACK 

                          Yumehama Marina, please.

                                        JACK

                          Huh? Where? 

 

So much for the company paid Japanese lessons. 

Jack writes down on a memo and shoves it at the driver. 

 

                                  CABBIE (CONT'D) 

                                    (in Japanese)

                          Why didn't you show me this in the first place? 

 

                                        JACK

Jack uses his cell phone to call Eiji. 

He put the cell to his ear. 


                                        JACK 

                          Yeah, I'm here. Where would you like me to meet you?

Cabbie counts the change. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          He s getting little crazy. 

                          Okay, where you at? 

                          Terrace Caf . Terrace Caf , I ll meet you. 


 Cabbie hands the change to Jack. 


16 EXT. YUMEHAMA MARINA, ENTRANCE GATE 

Jack gets of the taxi. 

He walks between the yachts, looking for the Terrace Caf . 

 

17 INT. TERRACE CAF  

Jack enters looking around for Eiji.. 

YURI SAITO (30) sits in a daze alone at a table. 

She notices Jack.. 


                                        YURI 

                                                Jack? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri. 


                                        YURI 

                           What're you doing here? 


                                        JACK 

                          I just got a call from Eiji.  He asked me to meet him here. 

 



                                          16   


                                        YURI 

                          He called you here? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yeah. What? Did something happen? 

 

                                        YURI 

                                      (whispering) 

                          That worries me. 

 


                                        JACK 

                                  (it worries him, too) 

                          Why Yuri? What s the matter? 


                                        YURI 

                          Why didn't you come the other night? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          I told you I had to work late--. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          That isn t true, is it? 

 

Jack looks away and falls silent. 


18  INT. TERRACE CAFE, ANOTHER CORNER 

EIJI  SAITO  (50)  watches  the  two  with  an  expressionless  but  scary  face  like  that  off  a  Noh 

theatre mask.  He watches them, but they don t see him. 

 

19  INT. TERRACE CAFE M6 

                                                                                              (403) 


                                          17   


                                        JACK 

                      (stammering a bit, in a low, confessional voice) 

                          Truthfully, I ve been worried this little situation we got here. 

                          At first, I don t know, I thought we were seeing each other  M6 

                          because I was lonely guy in a lonely city and a and now 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Now, you re serious. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yeah. 


                                        YURI 

                          But Jack it s probably too late to worry now. 

                          He might be on to us. 

 

                                        JACK 

                              (a touch upset and shocked) 

                          What&Eiji? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          You know the kind of man he is, right? 

                          If he really knew about us, he'd do just... 


Eiji approaches with a totally different expression than from earlier: hale and friendly. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                    (shaking his hand) 

                          Hey! Thanks for coming, Jack. 
 

                                        JACK 



                                          18   


                          Eiji, listen. We don't have a lot of time. 

                          We got to get on the situation right away. 

 

                                        YURI  

                                                Oh, yeah. Go ahead. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Don't rush yourself, Jack. 

                          There's plenty of time for talking on the ocean. 

                          Have a seat! 

 

                                        JACK 

                          The ocean? 


Yuri shifts her line of sight away from the men. 


                                          EIJI 

                          Of course.  Where better to talk business but on the sea? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          You want me to go out on the boat? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          You don't mind, do you? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Sorry, I don t do water. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          I thought you needed to talk. 

 



                                          19   


                                        JACK 

                          Yeah& The sea and I do not get along. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Oh, c mon Jack, don t be a child. I won't let you say no. 

                          Or have you got some reason you won't ride on my boat? 

                          Perhaps a more important client waiting? 

                                                Jack, have a seat! Take off your jacket! 

 

Jack steals a glance of Yuri. She's got a worried expression on her face. 
                                                                                              M7 
There s no way Jack can back out. 
                                                                                            (473) 


20  EXT. YUMEHAMA MARINA, FLOATING PIER 

Eiji's cruiser is docked outside. The three walk up, Jack s face a mask of trepidation. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Well isn't she beautiful? This 48-foot princess has twin 550 

                          horsepower engines. Unlike other boats with many owners, 

                          she's true to me. 

                                (grabbing Yuri by the arm) 

                          She's just like my wife. My treasure and mine only. 

 

The name on the bow of the boat reads: Yuri.  Yuri puts on an insincere smile.

                          She s a beauty, all right. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          And she rides like a dream. C mon. Let's have fun. 

 




                                          20   


Eiji boards the cruiser and heads up to the flying bridge deck, leaving Jack to stand still on the 

pier a moment. 

Jack had been frighteningly and seem looks about the surface of the water.  M8 

                                                                                                ) 
Nothing is reflected in water.  (563

His eyes lock on Yuri who is boarding the cruiser. Their eyes meet. M8 

She enters the cabin area. 

Jack boards the cruiser. 

Then, the VOICE of a young boy is heard faintly carried by the wind. 

 

                                      THE VOICE 

                          Jack... Jack... 

 

As Jack hangs his head down peering at the water, Sean's body floats along, staring balefully up 

at him from below the water. 

Jack freezes. 


                                          EIJI 

                          Jack, what're you doing? We gonna  miss the sunset. 

 

As always, Jack closes his eyes, breathes deeply and then slow opens his eyes. 

Sean's phantom has disappeared. 


                                        JACK 

                          I m Sorry. 

 

Jacks boards the boat. 


21 INT. CABIN 

Jack enters, looking at the interior of the cabin. 

Yuri stands by the kitchen, placing the groceries and kitchen supplies from the bag. 

 



                                          21   


                                        JACK 

                                (Coming closer to Yuri) 

                          Here, let me give you a hand with this. 


                                        YURI 

                          Oh, no. No thank you. 

                          I m fine. 

                                        JACK 

        It s okay. 


Jack hears Yuri, but helps her anyway. 

Yuri takes out the kitchen knife and places in the kitchen. 

Jack looks at the knife in daze. 


                                        YURI 

                          Look I m sorry I got you into all this. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Look, we got us into all this, okay? 

 

                                        YURI 

  Yeah& 


Jack s hand, trying to put on the jar, is touched by Yuri s hand. 

Yuri looks at Jack. 

Jack looks Yuri in the eye. 

The two stare at each other. 


                                      EIJI(O.C.) 

                                    (in japanease) 

                          Yuri, we are clearing the port. 



                                          22   


 

                                        YURI 

                                    (in japanease) 

                          Coming! 

 

Jack and Yuri look away each other. An awkward moment. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I ve got to go. 

 

Yuri walks out the cabin. 

Jack is left alone in the cabin.

He pushes the axle level forward. 

Yuri is on the deck, pulling the fender.

Eiji's cruiser leaves the marina. 

Eiji sits on the flying bridge.

                          Sean! 


Sean's arm slips from Jack's grasp. 

Sean sinks into the sea. 

Some time later. 

                                                                                CUT TO: 

31  INT. CABIN 

Jack sits quietly, his mind on the long-ago death of his brother. 

Jack puts a glance on a coffee cup, and finds refection of SEAN s face. 



                                          24   


Jack senses he's being watched and turns around. 

But there's no one to be found. 

Yuri enters from the rear deck. 


                                        YURI M10 

                          Hey are you all right?  You don't look so good. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          I m fine. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I'll get you some seasick pills, ok? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          It s ok. I don t need any seasick pills. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          What s the matter, Jack?  How come you re so afraid of the ocean? 

 

He looks at her for a beat, decides to confide in her. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                  (can't find the words) 

                          When I was a kid, my little brother drowned in the ocean. 

                          I was right there with him at the time. I was holding his hand. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Oh I m sorry.  


She  put  her  hand  his  shoulder,  and  that  connection takes  him  out  of  his  reverie.    He  takes  her 

hand. 



                                          25   


 

                                        JACK 

                          Why did you marry Eiji? 

 

She is shocked about his throws. 


                                        YURI 

                          What?---- because --- 

But that throws her off guard. 


                                        YURI 

                                    (sitting down) 

                          Because he gave me what I thought I wanted... 

                          and I guess I gave him the same. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          What was that you thought you wanted? 


                                        YURI 

                          Things: a nice house, the best car, unlimited access to 

                          a large bank account.  Just whatever I wanted. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Right, and he gets a beautiful wife to wear on his arm. 

                          Like an ornament or an accessory or something. 

                          It s very nice trade. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          But things have changed, and I have changed. 

                          I know that now, because I met you. 

 



                                          26   


Jack wonders what she s on about. 
                                                                                          M11 

                                                                                            (393) 
                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          I'm going to leave him, Jack. 

 M11 

He looks up at her. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          You re too afraid to ask him, aren t you? 

 


                                        YURI 

                          If you were me, what would you do? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          I might be too afraid to ask him too. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Yeah... 


They look at one another, trapped within an impossible situation. 

 

32  EXT. THE FRONT DECK 

The boat comes to a stop.  Eiji drops the anchor from the front deck. 

The anchor chain unravels, plunging into the depths. 

 

33  EXT.  THE  CRUISER  ON  THE  OCEAN  WITH  THE  SHORE  FAR  OFF  IN  THE 

DISTANCE 


34  INT. CABIN 

Eiji, who is wearing reading glasses, peruses some documents. 



                                          27   


 

                                          EIJI 

                              (looking up from the papers) 

                          So, what do you suggest I do? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Do you trust me to handle this? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Trust you? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Exactly. You know I m not gonna let anything bad happen to you. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                      (grinning) 

                          Fine. I'll leave it you. But don't you ever betray me, Jack. 

 

What does he know? 

                                        JACK 

                          C mon Eiji! You know I know better than that. 

 

Yuri comes up the stairs entering the cabin. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Are you men finished talking business, yet? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Yeah. Hungry too. Are we ready to eat? 

                                        YURI 

                          Yeah, almost. 



                                          28   


 

                                        JACK 

                          Oh, I m sorry Eiji. I ve got a whole lot a work  

                          I ve got to do back at the office. 

                          Could you drop me at the next harbor? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Come on, Jack. At least stays. Eat with us. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          No, I can t. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Yes, Jack. Please. 

 

                                          Eiji 

                                                You must be hungry? 

 

Reaction shot of Jack. 




REEL.3 

35  INT. CABIN - SOMETIME LATER 

Yuri is laying out the meal on the table.  The three are having a late lunch. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          So, how's your Japanese coming? After two years here, 

                          you've probably improved, huh? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          No. My Japanese is terrible. I think I might have

                           beginning to get worse. 

                          I don t think I m gonna ever get the hang of your language. 

 


                                          EIJI 

                          Pillow talk, son. The best way to master a foreign language 

                          is to get a local woman. 


                                        JACK 

                          Never heard that before. It s too bad no one will have me. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Don't be so modest, Jack. Just being an American in Tokyo 

                          means there are plenty of girls whose eyes would light up 

                          over you. Surely you've found that out once or twice. 

 

                                        JACK 

                              (trying not to look at Yuri) 

                          I wish. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          "Thou shalt not commit adultery". Right, Jack? 

                          You know what happens to people who do it? 

 

The dinner conversation comes to a standstill. 

Yuri covers up the silence by serving the men more food. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          "God Only Knows", I guess. 

 

                                          EIJI 



                                          30   


                          They go to hell, Jack. In the old days in Japan, 

                          people who committed infidelity were sliced into four parts. 

                          The proper punishment for sinners. 


                                        YURI 

                          Can we change the subject? 

                          Let's talk about something more fun. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                      (grabbing her) 

                          I ll change the subject. So just wait. 

 

                                    EIJI (CONT'D) 

                          Jack, what do you think is my treasured thing 

                          in the whole world? 

 

Nothing from Jack. 

 

                                    EIJI (CONT'D) 

                                  (hugging Yuri close) M12 

                                                                                                ) 
                          MY Yuri. Four years since we got married and she (513

                          still fascinates me. There are plenty of men who'd love to 

                          make a play for her, even knowing she's a married woman. 

                          Don't you think so? 

 

Jack doesn't know how to answer.  Is Eiji toying with him? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Stop it. You're embarrassing him. 

 

Yuri moves away from Eiji. 



                                          31   


                                          EIJI 

                          Answer the question, Jack. 

 


                                        YURI M12 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Eiji, will you stop. 


                                          EIJI 

                          What's wrong, Jack? She's beautiful, isn t she? Am I right? 

 

Jack can't answer. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Will you lay off. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Say something, Jack. She's beautiful, right? 

 

Jack can t answer. 

                                          EIJI 

                          C mon ! Tell me! 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yes,  Eiji.  Yes.  No  one  could  argue  that  Yuri  is  a  very  beautiful 

                          woman. Are you happy now? 

 

Eiji lets out a BIG LAUGH. 






                                          32   


                                          EIJI 

                          Yes, Jack. Very happy. 

 

Eiji LAUGHS even louder than before. 


                                        YURI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Have you lost your mind? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                (laughing and in Japanese) 

                          What's with you? He complimented you. Be happy, babe.

Jack doesn t know how to say. 

  

36  EXT. THE OPEN SEA  

Eiji tools along in his cruiser. 


37  EXT. FLYING BRIDGE  

While HUMMING in good spirits, Eiji pilots the boat. 

 

38  INT. CABIN 

Yuri sits on the sofa. 

Jack stands her side. 


                                        JACK 

                          So, he knows about us. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I wonder if we'll make it home alright. 

 



                                          33   


                                        JACK 

                          What do you mean? 

 


                                        YURI M13 

                          When I met him, he was already married. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Right I knew you were his second wife. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          He told me she was emotionally unstable. 

                          But we got married because she disappeared. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                    (shivering a bit) 

                          Yuri, what are you saying? 

 

                                        YURI 

                                  (looking up at him) 

                          I'm scared, Jack. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri, stop it! Just stop it! 

                          Okay, you were Eiji s "most treasured thing" 

                          in the world. You remember that? 

                          He's not the kind of guy who'd do anything... dangerous, right? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I'm his treasure. And you know what he s capable of doing&

                                          34   


Her s an uneasy expression. 





39  EXT. FLYING BRIDGE M14 

Eiji takes out a diver's knife from the console glove compartment. 

He takes the knife out of the sheath and studies the blade. 

 

40  INT. CABIN 

Yuri suddenly looks outside the window. A sense of discomfort comes over her. 

She goes beside the window. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          That's strange. 

Jack stares out the window too. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          What is it? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          If we were heading back, we should see the shore by now. 

 

Yuri  studies  the  GPS.  The  GPS  reveals  that  they  are  headed  in  the  opposite  direction  of  the 

shore. 


41  EXT. FLYING BRIDGE 

Yuri comes up. Eiji is at the controls. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Where are you heading? Aren't we supposed to be going back? 



                                          35   


 

                                          EIJI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          We'll head back after we've had a little more fun. 

                          The real fun is yet to come. 

Yuri doesn t know how to answer. 

Eiji HUMS a song. 

Suddenly, a BAFFLING SOUND is heard. 


42  EXT. THE BUBBLES FROM THE PROPS UNDER THE REAR DECK DISAPPEAR 

 

43  EXT. FLYING BRIDGE 

 

                                        YURI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          What? What s wrong? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Don't worry.  

 

Eiji goes to restart the engine by pushing the starter. 

No matter how many times he tries, NOTHING. The sound of the STARTER is heard grinding 

away, but the engine doesn't turn over. 


                                          EIJI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                                        Damn it. 

 

Eiji smacks his lips and goes down the flying bridge steps. 

 



                                          36   


44  INT. CABIN 

Jack is studying out the window. 

Eiji enters and puts on light. 

                                        JACK 

                          Eiji, what s happened? 

                          Eiji, talk to me.  

 

Eiji doesn't answer and heads into the engine room. 

Yuri tries to run after Eiji. 

 Jack stops Yuri and he goes after Eiji. 

                                        YURI 

                                      (to Jack) 

                                                Be careful. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                                Okay. 

  

Jack heads into the engine room. 


45  INT. ENGINE ROOM 

Eiji examines the engine. 

                                        JACK 

                                      (entering) 

                          Is it broken? 


                                          EIJI 

                          No, the engine is fine. The prop probably got hung 

                          up on some seaweed. Lend me you hand. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Me? 


                                          37   


 

Eiji heads outside with Jack following. 


46  INT. CABIN 

Yuri awaits the men in the cabin. 

Eiji and Jack go out the engine room. 

Eiji opens a storage compartment under the sofa and takes out some rope. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Look, I d love to help, but I don't know my way 

                          around a boat. 

 

Eiji heads for the rear deck, ignoring him. 


47  EXT. REAR DECK 

Jack timidly makes an entrance.  

Yuri comes out from the cabin. 

Eiji throws the rope at Jack. 


                                        JACK 

                          What do you want me to do with this? 


                                          EIJI 

                          Only one thing to do. It's a lifeline. 

                          Dive down and take a look at the prop. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          I can't do that. 


                                          EIJI 

                          Captain's orders. Disobey them and I'll hang you 



                                          38   


                          with that rope. 

 

Is he joking?  But there s little humor in it. 

 


                                        JACK 

                          I already told you. I don't like water, okay? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Don't tell me you can't swim? You're from Long Island, right? 

                          Don't go soft on me, Jack my boy. Show a little backbone. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Eiji, Jack's our guest. Leave him alone, okay? 

 




                                          EIJI 

                              (whispering into Jack's ear) 
                                                                                            M15 
                          Found a nice ally, huh Jack. How did you seduce my wife? 
                                                                                            (173) 
 

Eiji heads for the cabin 

Nothing from Jack, too shocked to reply. 

Jack sees Yuri. 


48  EXT. OPEN SEA - NIGHT 

Night shot of the cruiser bobbing up and down on the sea.  

 

49  EXT. CRUISER - REAR DECK 

He ties a lifeline rope around his waist. He changes into a wet-suit.   

He also has a diver s knife attached to his leg. 



                                          39   


 

                                          EIJI 

                          If anything happens, I'll tug on the rope. 

                          Then pull me up. Okay? 

 

Jack is holding the rope with Yuri standing next to him. 

 


                                        JACK 

                          It s no problem. 

 

Eiji puts on his goggles, and with a flashlight in one hand, dives into the water. 

Eiji's body soon disappears into the darkness of the water as he swims downwards. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I wonder if we'll make it home in one piece. 

 

                                        JACK 

                              (almost convincing himself) 

                          We re gonna be okay? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I hope so.

50  EXT. THE SEA - UNDERWATER (12

Eiji, flashlight in hand, is under the boat. 

He inspects the twin propellers of the boat in the illumination of the flashlight. There is some sort 

of black matter wrapped around the propellers. 

Eiji takes his divers knife and begins to cut free the black matter from one of the propellers. 

The black matter appears to be not seaweed, but rather long strands of black human hair. 




                                          40   


Eiji  looks  rather  shocked.  Seemingly  repulsed  by  the  material  he  is  cutting  away  from  the 

propeller, he hurriedly throws it away from him. 

 

51  EXT. REAR DECK 

Eiji appears on the surface of the water near the rear deck to take a breath. 

 

                                        YURI M16 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Was it seaweed? 

 

Eiji looks at his hand which has been touching the seaweed-like stuff. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                                  Well, what was it? 

 

Eiji dives again without answering. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          What the hell is he doing? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Who knows. 

 

52  EXT. FLYING DECK 

There is no one on the deck. 

Suddenly the switch flicks over and the lamp on the starter motor is engaged. M17 

                                                                                                ) 
The throttle lever trembles.  (353


53  EXT. SEA - UNDERWATER 

Eiji cuts away the hair-like substance and throws it away. 



                                          41   


 

54  EXT. FLYING DECK 

The throttle lever trembles.  


55  EXT. SEA - UNDERWATER 

Eiji pulls out the hair-like substance and throws it away. 

 

56  EXT. FLYING DECK 

The throttle lever trembles.  


57  EXT. IN THE SEA - UNDERWATER 

Having finished clearing the black hair-like matter from one propeller, Eiji moves on to the next 

one. As Eiji cuts away the black hair-like matter from one propeller, suddenly the hair extends 
                                                                                              M18 
outwards and Eiji's arm becomes entangled in it. 
                                                                                              (503) 

Eiji is shocked, and in his surprise drops the knife. 

Eiji's arm, caught in the hair, is being drawn in towards the propeller. 

Through the goggles we see Eiji's look of horror. 


58  EXT. FLYING DECK 

The throttle swings to backward. 


59  EXT. REAR DECK 

Before Jack and Yuri's eyes, the sea behind the boat suddenly churns into a mass of foam. 

Jack and Yuri both look in shock. 

The rope in Jack's hands is being pulled strongly into the sea. 

He is about to get pulled in too. 


                                        JACK 

                          Pull the rope, pull the rope! 


                                        YURI 



                                          42   


                          What's happening? 


                                        JACK 

                          Just grab the line... quickly. Common!  

 

Yuri stops moving. 

                                           M18 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Yuri! Grab the line! 

 

Yuri doesn't move. 

                                        YURI 

                                                No, Jack. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          What are you talking-- 

 

Yuri begins to back away. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          No, Jack. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Are you crazy? If we don't do anything Eiji is... 

 

                                        YURI 

                          No! 

 

The tension in the rope Jack is holding goes flat. 

Jack falls on his behind.  

                                        JACK 



                                          43   


                          Oh, god. Eiji ..Eiji! 

Jack hurriedly pulls up the rope. Yuri watches vacantly. 

The end of the rope which Jack pulls up is cleanly cut. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Eiji! 

 

Jack looks into the sea, but there is no sign of Eiji. 

Jack turns and looks at Yuri grimly. Yuri picks up the rope. 

Jack walks away from her and rushes to the cabin. 


56  INT. CABIN 

Jack is frantically searching in the storage space underneath the sofa. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                      (entering) 

                          What are you doing? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Emergency flashlight. There's got to be one around some place. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          And what are you going to do with it? You going diving? 

 

Jack makes no answer. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          Well, I won't. Jack, please& Let s just stop this! 

                          It was an accident, it s over. An accident! 

                                                Jack! 

With the flashlight in his hand, he turns and heads back out onto the deck. 



                                          44   


 

60  EXT. REAR DECK 

Yuri chases after Jack onto the rear deck. She grabs hold of him. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Jack! Jack, he's dead! 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Look, he might not be, alright!! 

                          Maybe he's just out there injured somewhere, we can t see him. 

  

                                        YURI 

                          Look! Everything would be much simpler if he was dead. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                      (shocked) 

                          How can you say that? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Let him be dead, Jack. 

 

They look at one another, taking in the import of what Yuri wants to do. 

Suddenly,  Eiji  comes  climbing  up  a  ladder  onto  the deck  across  from  them,  as  if  nothing  had 

happened. 

Jack and Yuri are in shock. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Eiji! You okay? 

 

                                          EIJI 



                                          45   


                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Yeah& 

 

Eiji gets himself up onto the deck and then sits down. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Are you hurt? 

 

Eiji has a bit of a look at himself. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          No. No injuries. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          But...the propeller&we watched the propeller& 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          The propeller? It was seaweed after all. 

Eiji looks vacant.  

 

                                    EIJI (CONT'D) 
                                                                                              M19

                          I'm going to change. 

Eiji stands up rather sluggishly. 

Eiji heads towards the cabin. 

                                        JACK 

                                      (to Yuri) 

                          What did he just say? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          He's going to change.

CRUISER. 


62  EXT. FLYING DECK 

Eiji and Yuri are both on the flying deck. 

Eiji engages the starter button of the engine. The sound of the engine ROARS to life. 

Eiji engages the throttle. 

Yuri looks at the water behind the cruiser. But there is no sign of anything happening there. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          The props aren't working. 

 

Eiji throws the throttle lever to the max. The sound of the engine ROARS AT FULL POWER. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          You'll damage the engine. 

 

Eiji doesn't answer. He just holds the throttle down at full. 

 


REEL.4 

63  INT. CABIN 

Jack sits on the sofa. 

Jack sees smoke start to come from a crack in a panel leading to the engine room. 

Jack opens the panel to the engine room. Smoke billows out. 

Shortly the engine stops suddenly with a thud. 

Eiji climbs down from the flying deck. 

                                        JACK 



                                          47   


                          What happened? What did you do? 

 

Eiji makes no reply, but simply heads towards the master bedroom. 
                                                                                              M20 
As he passes by, Jack notices some blood on the floor. 
                                                                                              (503) 

 

 

                                        JACK M20 

                          Eiji, are you really OK? 

 

Eiji stops walking to answer. But does not turn around. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          What? 

 

Yuri comes from the rear deck. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          What's going on? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          It s Eiji. He s really hurt. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          What do you mean? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Look at the blood on the floor. 


But when they look down at the place where the blood was, somehow it has vanished. 

 

                                        YURI 



                                          48   


                          Where? 

 

                                        JACK 

        There was blood on the floor& 


Jack looks back at her blankly. 

                                        YURI M20 

                          Jack?

A calm looking Eiji is sitting on the bed. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Eiji, don't you want to use the radio& call for help? 

 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Why? Nothing to worry about. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          We can't move. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          I said there's nothing to worry about. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          But... 



                                          49   


 

Suddenly  they  hear  a  mechanical  yet  human  THUMPING sound.  The  EERIE  sound  and 

REVERB gives you the creeps. 

Jack and Yuri turns around toward the cabin. 

  

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          What's that? 

                                        YURI 

                          I'm not sure. Something s hitting the boat. 

 

66  INT. CORRIDOR 

Jack and Yuri look around, but there doesn't seem to be anything around or any danger. 

But as Jack looks around he notices at the bow of the boat what seems to be a YOUNG BOY. 

Jack fearfully heads towards the rear decks of the boat. 

Yuri follows after him. 


67  EXT. REAR DECK 

Jack looks around him. He seems to see something off the bow in the water. 

A cap floats on the surface of the water. 

Jack closes his eyes, takes some deep breaths and then looks at the water again. 

The cap is still there. 


                                        YURI 

                                                Are you okay?

                          What? Is something wrong with the cap?

                                      (shocked) 

                          What!? Can you see&Can you see that too?

                                                What? Yes. Jack ? 

  

Yuri looks a bit confused by Jack's behavior. 


68  INT. CABIN 

Yuri holds the microphone of the radio in her hand. 

 

                                        YURI

                          please respond, over. 

 

Jack takes out his cell phone and tries to call help. 

The message NO SIGNAL appears on his cell phone screen. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Nothing. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          No response here either. But it's not possible that 

                          we're out of radio range.

Yuri adjusts the channel settings on the radio. 

Noise and static splutters from the radio, mixed in with the static can be heard a BOY'S VOICE. 

 

                                    BOY'S VOICE

                                                 Turn it off! 

 

A shaken Yuri turns the radio off. 



                                          52   


 

                                        JACK 

                          What in God's name is happening? 


Jack, confused, sits down on the nearby desk. Tired. 

 

                                        YURI M22 

                          Jack? What was that? It sounded like that voice was calling 

                          your name. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                      (haunted) 

                          It was Sean.  

 

                                        YURI 

                                                 What? 

                                        JACK 

                                      (haunted) 

                                                 It was Sean's voice. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                      (frightened) 

                          You mean... your little brother? The one who drowned? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          You remember the cap? That was Sean's cap. 

Yuri shivers. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          You see... I killed him. He didn't just drown. I could have 

                          saved him. Instead, I stood by and watched him die& 



                                          53   


                          and he knows it s my fault... 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Stop it, Jack! 

 

At this point, the grating SOUND of something metal and heavy being pulled along the floor can 

be heard. Yuri turns around to face the noise. 

 


                                        JACK 

                          Eiji. 

 

Yuri also turns around to look. Eiji is walking up the corridor pulling an anchor behind him. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          Eiji & 

Eiji is silent. He looks at Yuri with what look like the eyes of a dead man.    M23 

                                                                                              ) 
Yuri can t move. (513

Eiji looks at Yuri. 

Jack anxiously sees Eiji. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          I was killed... it was your fault, I was killed because of you. 

                          If only you hadn't been here, I would not have died. 

 

At some point in this dialogue, Eiji's voice transforms into the VOICE OF A WOMAN. 

Jack looks in shock. 

Yuri begins to back away. 

 

                          EIJI (WOMAN'S VOICE) (CONT'D) 



                                          54   


                                    (in Japanese) 

                          I will never forgive you.  


Yuri starts back. 

Eiji lifts up the anchor. 

Yuri screams. M23 

                                        JACK 

                          Eiji, stop!. 

 

Jack hurls himself at Eiji. But Eiji brushes him off with superhuman strength. 

Jack bangs his head as he lands and is concussed. 

Eiji swings the anchor down. 

We here Yuri s scream.  

                                                                      FADE TO BLACK 

69  INT. CABIN - SOME TIME LATER 

Darkness. 

NOISES. 

Jack opens his eyes regaining consciousness. 

The noises are coming from above, on the flying deck. 

 




                                        JACK 

                                      (Whispering) 

                                        Yuri& 

 

Yuri has been gone. 

Jack opens the storage area under the sofa and pulls out a wrench.. 

 

70  EXT. REAR DECK 

Jack fearfully creeps out onto the deck. M24 

                                                                                            (323) 


                                          55   


Jack can see the back of Eiji on the flying deck doing something. 

Jack goes back to the cabin. 


71  INT. CABIN 

Jack looks around the cabin but cannot find Yuri. 

Jack heads down to the corridor. M24 


72  INT. CORRIDOR 

The door to the head won't open. Jack tries to open the door but stops as he hear nosies coming 

from the flying deck. 

Jack walks down the corridor opening each door in search of Yuri. 

 

 

                                        JACK 

                                      (Whispering) 

                          Yuri.... 

 

73  INT. MASTER BEDROOM 

Jack enters the bedroom. 

Jack opens each door. 

But she's not there. 


74  INT. CABIN 

Jack comes back to the cabin. He opens the hatch to the engine room, and enters. 

 

75  INT. ENGINE ROOM 

Jack comes down to the engine room. 

She's not there. 


76  INT. CABIN 

Jack heads for the cabin. 



                                          56   


But he sees Eiji on the rear deck with the anchor. 


77  EXT. REAR DECK 

Eiji, with the anchor in one hand, unties with the other the life-ring hanging from the deck. 

Eiji throws the life-ring into the water. 

Eiji moves onto the other life-ring and starts working on eighty-sixing it too. 

Eiji stops his work as he notices noises. 

Eiji turns around. 
                                                                                            M25 

Jack appears, wrench in hand. (22
                                                                                              583) 

                                        JACK 

                          What did you do with Yuri? 

                          What did you do! 

 

Eiji makes no reply. He begins to lift the anchor. 

Jack stands ready with his wrench. 

Eiji approaches Jack, slowly. Jack backs away. 


78  INT. CABIN 

Jack and Eiji enters the cabin. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Where is she? C mon, answer me. 

                          Eiji&stay back! Stay back!  

 

Eiji swings the anchor at Jack. 

Jack desperately tries to defend himself with the wrench, but his timing is out. 

Jack dodges a swing of the anchor as it smashes a support for the back. 

There is a clash of metal as the anchor and wrench meet, the wrench is flicked out of Jack's hand 

and goes flying. 

The now unarmed Jack tries to avoid the strikes of Eiji's anchor. But the anchor scrapes his inner 

thigh taking off a scoop of flesh 



                                          57   


Jack falls down. 

Jack tries to stem the flow of blood from the wound. 

Eiji  looks  at  Jack  with  a  creepy,  seemingly  possessed  expression  on  his  face.  With  this  same 

expression on his face, Eiji advances on Jack. 

Limping, Jack backs away toward a desk. 

Eiji attacks, swinging the anchor in hand. M25 

Jack dodges a swing of the anchor as it smashes a light on the desk. 

Jack dodges the anchor as it smashes into and penetrates halfway through a sofa. 

Jack escapes to the kitchen. 

Eiji tries to pull the anchor back out from the sofa, but it won't come. 

Jack desperately searches for a weapon. He picks up a kitchen knife. 

Jack, armed with the knife, faces Eiji. 


                                        JACK 

                          We end this now. 

                                                Back off& you back off, Eiji! Back off! 

 

Jack goes back the cabin. 

Eiji looks at the tip of the knife, but isn t upset. 

And Eiji continues to walk towards Jack. 

Eiji grips Jack by the throat and falls in the sofa with Jack, with the knife in his hand. 

The knife pierces Eiji's stomach.  

Jack is stunned. 

Eiji sits up silently. 

Jack sits up, too. 

Eiji looks down at the knife sticking out of his stomach with a strange expression on his face. 

Eiji pulls the knife out of his guts. But no blood follows it. 

Jack can t move. 

 Instead, blood spurts out from above Eiji's shoulder. One of Eiji's arms then detaches and drops 

to the ground. 

Jack is amazed. 



                                          58   


Half of Eiji's face also seems to have been wrenched off. 

A shocked Jack GULPS. 

Eiji draws away from Jack. 




79  EXT. REAR DECK 

The broken Eiji stumbles back from the cabin. He lets out a blood-curdling CRY  

and then- - plunges straight down into the sea. 

80  INT. CABIN 

Jack looks down in pain at his own leg, from which blood is running. 

Jack falls. 


81  INT. HEAD 

Yuri  is  collapsed  in  the  bathroom,  unconscious.  There  is  an  injury  on  her  forehead  where  it 

appears she has been struck. There is a faint sound of WATER DRIPPING from the faucet. 

Yuri groggily regains consciousness and holds the wound on her forehead. 

                          Yuri stands up and tries to open the head door. 

 

82  INT. CABIN 

Eiji's severed arm lies on the floor.

Jack sees that Eiji's arm has grabbed hold of Jack's injured leg around the ankle. 
                                                                                        (12383)

The arm is holding Jack s leg back. He cannot move. 

 

89  INT. HEAD 

Suddenly water cascades from the faucet in the head. 

Yuri tries to turn off the taps, but they won't go off. The water won't stop. 

Then, a deep GURGLING sound begins to come from the toilet bowl. Suddenly, water begins to 

gush out from under the toilet lid. 


                                        YURI  

                           Help!

Jack tries to open the door, but the knob won't move. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri! Okay, listen to me. I m gonna get you out of them.

                                          63   


Jack desperately looks around for some kind of tool to use to open the door. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                                Just hold on!

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          I love her. 

 

A long haired woman, NAOMI (age 40) stares grimly at Eiji, who stands before her holding a 

glass. 

 

                                        NAOMI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          What did you say?

                        (making himself a drink and in Japanese) 



                                          65   


                          What I was attracted to was the inheritance 

                          from your parents.  


(FLASH--present) 

Yuri stares at the scene. 

                                                                                          M27

                          From the very beginning, 

                          I never felt the slightest love for you. 

 

Naomi responds with a high pitched laugh. 

 

                                        NAOMI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Do you think you can get away with this? 

                          Your  company, the house, even this cruiser.   

                          You wouldn't have any of these without me. 

 

Eiji appears to be paying no attention to what Naomi is saying. 

 

                                  NAOMI (CONT'D) 

                          I'll take it all. Every red cent of your assets will be mine.

Yuri stares at the scene. 


Quite calmly, Eiji picks up a blunt instrument lying close by and strikes to Naomi's head.

                                    (in Japanese)

                                    (in Japanese)

                           You're getting your blood all over my 

                          beautiful cruiser! 

                          Can you imagine how much it costs replacing the floor?

                                          EIJI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Who do you think you're looking at like that, huh? 

 

Naomi, panting, slowly fixes Eiji with a grim smile. 

 

                                        NAOMI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          You... and that woman... I'll never forgive you. 




                                          68

                          Yuri! Yuri! 

 

There is no sound from the other side of the door. 

Jack strikes into the gap between the door and the door frame with the axe. 

The door suddenly busts open, and masses of water come gushing out. 

Yuri's limp body also comes lolling out of the head together with the water. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Yuri! Common Yuri! 

 

Jack slaps her cheek.  

But Yuri doesn t wake up. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri! Yuri! Can you hear& 

                          Common!

                                        JACK 

                                  (screaming in anguish)

                                          70   


 

Jack clenches his fists and pounds on her chest. 

Still no response from Yuri. 

But she s still out. 

Jack recalls some faint memory. He grabs Yuri s nose, raises her jaw, forces open her mouth and 

begins mouth to mouth resuscitation. Yuri still won t respond. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                  (in a crying voice)

Jacks pounds on her chest again. 

Yuri spits up some water and coughs. 

Jack gently hugs her.

                          Oh, my God! Thank God.

                          What? Yuri, what are you talking about? Sweetheart. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          He killed Naomi. 

 

                                        JACK

                          Eiji murdered her so he could marry me. 

 

Yuri begins to cry. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          This is where Eiji dumped her body. 

                          He dumped her body in this part of the sea. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Okay. Okay. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          That's why this area is cursed. That s why this sea 

                          is cursed!(in Japanese) It s cursed! It s cursed!  




                                          72   


Yuri cannot control herself any longer, in a combination of fear and shock she begins to weep 

uncontrollably. 

Jack embraces Yuri and steadies down.  

 

                                        JACK 

                          Hey, hey, it s okay. We have to get it together.

                          Jack, Jack, listen. If we stay here, we're dead. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          That s why we get the fuck out of here, okay? 

                          Hang on to me& Let s go.

                                          73   


 

Yuri stares blankly at the destruction. 

Then they hear that same THUMPING sound they heard previously 

. 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Oh, shit! 

 

Yuri covers her ears with her hands. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          No, no! Stop it! 

 

Jack looks into the sea. 

From under the sea behind the rear deck of the cruiser a pallid light glows. An object begins to M28 

                                                                                              343)

                                        JACK 

                          What the fuck...? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          It s her! 

 

                                        JACK 

                                                C mon! 

 

Jack and Yuri urgently back away from the rear of the boat. 

 


134  INT. CABIN 

 

                                        JACK 



                                          74   


                          Hurry! 

 

Jack, leading Yuri by the hand, moves into the cabin. But Yuri catches her foot on something and 

falls over. Jack loses hold of Yuri's hand. 

Jack helps Yuri up out of the floor. M28 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Are you okay? 

                          C mon! C mon! 

 

Jack hurriedly takes Yuri in his arms and picks her up. 

As Yuri is being picked up, CLOSE UP on her face as she lifts it up. 

The face is not Yuri, somehow it has transformed to Naomi's. 

Jack s reaction, shocked. 

Naomi speaks in a VOICE NOT OF THIS WORLD. 

 

                                        NAOMI 

                          Jack. 

 

Jack looks at Naomi, shocked. He hears the voice but her lips are not moving. He begins to back 

away. 

 

                                  NAOMI (CONT'D) 

                          Jack. 

 

Naomi, covered in blood, slowly stands up. 

 

135  INT. CORRIDOR 

Jack backs away down the corridor, limping. Naomi follows. 

 

                                        JACK 



                                          75   


                          Stay back! 

 

Naomi, bathed in that same strange pallid light, continues to advance towards Jack. 

Jack, continuing to back away, picks up the fire axe. 

 
                                                                                              M28 
                                        NAOMI 

                          Jack. 

 

Naomi continues to advance on Jack. 

Jack stands facing Naomi, brandishing his axe. 


                                  NAOMI (CONT'D) 

                          Jack. 


Naomi continues to advance on Jack. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Stay  stay stay back... 

 

Jack raises the axe. 

Suddenly a SMALL BOY appears from behind Jack and embraces him. 

Jack turns round, looks down, and sees SEAN. 


                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Sean. 

 

As Jack looks at Sean, Naomi places her hand on Jack's neck from behind. 

Jack swings around and again raises the axe, seemingly about to strike. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Jack! No! 



                                          76   


 

Jack looks in shock. Now standing before him is not Naomi, but Yuri. 

Jack turns round and looks round. 

Sean disappears. 


                                        YURI 

                          Jack! Jack! Get a hold of yourself. 


Jack finds his head. 

From the cabin comes the muffled sound of a woman laughing. 

The lighting onboard the cruiser suddenly goes off. 

Jack  and  Yuri  are  standing  at  the  end  of  the  corridor  in  darkness.  They  look  around  them 

uneasily. 

The pallid glow appears around the area of the cabin. 

Jack and Yuri back away. 


                                        JACK 

                                               C mon! 

 

 They enter the master bedroom at the end of the corridor. 

 

136  INT. MASTER BEDROOM 

Jack locks the door and limps back away from it. 

The sound of Naomi's LAUGHTER can be heard approaching the door on the other side. 

Jack and Yuri look toward the door, terrified. 

The sound of Naomi's CACKLING suddenly stops. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          What happened? 

 

                                        JACK 



                                          77   


                          I... don't... know. 

 

Suddenly, in the mirror behind Jack, the image of a SMALL BOY appears. 

Jack swings around. 

But there is no one there. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          We're outta here! 

 

                                        YURI 

                                               Okay. 

 

Jack looks around. He sees the moonlight coming in from a skylight. 

Jack reaches for the skylight. 

Jack s face, intense.  

Yuri watches Jack what he is up to. 

Fearfully, he opens it. 

As  his  hand  goes  through  the  opening  in  the  skylight  it  is  grabbed  from  the  other  side  by  the 

hand of a woman. 

A shocked Yuri GULPS. 

Jack quickly pulls his hand back inside and slams the skylight shut. 

Jack winces at the pain caused by the injury in his leg. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          Oh my god! Are you Okay? 

 

                                        JACK 

                                    (holding his leg) 

                          Yeah ..I think so. 

 

A loud BANGING against the door. M29 

                                                                                          (12483) 


                                          78   


Yuri and Jack stand frozen, looking at the door in terror. 

The door SQUEAKS. It seems like it is being pushed forcefully from the other side. 

Yuri hides behind Jack, holding onto him. 

The door continues to squeak, and begins to crack. Is it breaking? 

The door continues to squeak and groan. M29 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          What is she doing? 


The door continues to squeak and groan. 

Yuri's expression suddenly changes. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I'll go. 

 

Jack turns round. 

                                        YURI 

                                (stepping away from Jack) 

                          I am the one she wants. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          What are you saying. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          I am the one she wants. If I go, you'll survive. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          What the hell are you talking about?. 


Yuri throws off Jack s inhibitions. 




                                          79   


                                        YURI 

                          Let me go. Let me go. 

 

Yuri pushes Jack aside, and heads towards the door. 

                                           M29 

                                        JACK 

                          Stop! 

 

Jack grabs Yuri and holds her back. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          I m not gonna lose you& 

 

Jack embraces Yuri. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Oh, Jack. 

 

The door begins to crack. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          Oh my god&What are we gonna do? 

 

Jack looks around. In the carpeted floor under his feet, he sees a pull ring for a trap door. 

 

137  INT. ENGINE ROOM PASSAGEWAY 

Yuri, followed by Jack, drops down into a narrow passage leading towards the engine room. 

The narrow passage stretches away before them. 

Half crawling, Jack and Yuri advance down the passage. 

Shot on Jack and Yuri crawling. 




                                          80   


Blood seeps from Jack's wound in his inner thigh.  The pain caused by the injury is visible on 

Jack's face as he crawls along. 


                                        YURI 

                          Oh my god. Are you okay? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Don't stop. Keep moving. 

                          C mon. C mon.  

 

From behind them, we hear the sound of a DOOR BREAKING. M30 

                                                                                            263)

Yuri comes up first, then offers her hand down to help Jack out. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Take my hand!

                                                 Jack, here. 

 

But Jack hesitates. 

                                        JACK 

                          No... I can't.

                                               We made it!  

 

Jack looks unconvinced. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                                        (smiling) 

                          She wasn't able to follow us this far from the boat. 

                          Oh my God. 

 

Yuri embraces Jack. She kisses him. 

Yuri s face is washed with relief, and an almost hysterical smile. Jack also finally allows himself 

a smile. They both embrace. 

But Jack's face, looking over Yuri's shoulder, suddenly changes expression. 

Behind Yuri is Naomi. 

Naomi stands on the surface of the sea. 

Jack screams. 

Yuri swings around to face Naomi. 
                                                                                        M32 

Naomi wraps herself around Yuri and pulls her down into the sea. (22
                                                                                          133) 

Yuri is pulled into the water. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri! 



                                          86   


 

Jack desperately holds on to Yuri's hand. 

Underwater, Naomi is wrapped around Yuri. 

Jack continues to hold on. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) M32 

                          Yuri! 

 

Yuri's face, underwater, is in agony. 

Jack holds on desperately... Just like 25 years ago... 

 

149  EXT. SEA - 25 YEARS EARLIER 

FLASH  BACK  TO  JACK  HOLDING  ONTO  SEAN'S  HAND  25  YEARS  EARLIER.  JACK 

LETS GO AND SEAN DROWNS. 




150  EXT. OPEN SEA - PRESENT 

It looks like Yuri's hand is going to come free from Jack's hand. 

But Jack continues to hold on; he won t let go this time. 

Yuri is in pain under the surface, as Naomi continues to hold tight. 

Suddenly, SEAN'S GHOST comes floating up from the depths of the ocean. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Sean! 

 

Sean advances on Yuri and Naomi. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          No! 

 

Sean grabs hold of Naomi s  arm. 



                                          87   


Naomi let go her hold of Yuri s body. 

Jack pulls on Yuri's arm in a tug of war.  

Before log, Yuri's head pops victoriously back up above the surface of the water. 

Jack embraces Yuri. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) M32 

                          Yuri, are you okay? It s okay. 

                          You still with me? You still with me? 

 

Yuri is out of breath, panting and exhausted, but she is able to nod. 

Jack looks down into the water. 

SEAN'S GHOST is restraining Naomi. 

Yuri also looks down into the water. 

SEAN,  continuing to hold onto Naomi, disappears as he descends down  into the depths of the 

sea, pulling Naomi from behind.. 

Jack and Yuri continue to stare downwards. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Sean... 

 

                                        YURI 

                          He was&He was protecting you. 

 

Jack and Yuri continue to look down towards where Sean disappeared. 

Then Sean's cap appears floating next to Jack. 


                                        JACK 

                                      Hold this. 

 

Jack gives the life ring to Yuri. 

Jack picks up the cap, and holds it tight.  



                                          88   


 


                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          Look 

                          . 

Jack turns to Yuri. 

Yuri points towards the horizon, where the first light of dawn is beginning to appear. M33 
                                                                                              )

151  EXT. THE SEA - ONE YEAR LATER 

A yacht cruises beneath a blue sky. 

Yuri takes the steer, and Jack stands right next to her. 

 

152  EXT. A YACHT ON THE SEA 

Jack holds the photo in hand. 

Jack and Sean in their childhood appear in the photograph. 

Yuri casts the anchor, and comes toward Jack. 

Yuri sits beside Jack. 

                                        YURI 

                          So, Jack& 

 

                                        JACK 

        Yeah& 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Are you still afraid of the ocean? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Not so much any more. 

                          I might even be starting to see its beauty.  

 



                                          89   


He  takes  her  hand  and  brings  it  to  his  mouth  for  a light  kiss,  and  she  lays  her  head  on  his 

shoulder. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          So what did the doctor say? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Well. It s three months and counting. 

 

Yuri lovingly places his hand on her belly, and strokes her tummy with it. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          You know, if it s a boy, at least we know what to call him. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                      (grinning) 

                          Yeah. His name works for me. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                               Hold on second. 

 

Jack gives the wreath to Yuri. 

Jack puts the photo into the wreath. 


                                        JACK 

                                               C mon! 

 

Jack and Yuri stand up the deck. 

Jack kisses the wreath.   

 

                                        JACK 
                                                                                          M34 

                                                                                          (22503) 

 
                                          90   


                          Goodbye Sean. 


Jack throws a wreath he had been holding into the water. 

 

 

                                        JACK M34 

                          We ll see you little soon again, pal. 

 

Jack and Yuri continue to look down on the sea. 

The photo of Jack and Sean in their childhood gently floats on the rise and fall of the sea swell.
