MODERN CITY STREET
DAY
22
DR. PARNASSUS and PERCY are performing on a street corner in
modern clothes. As are all the PASSERSBY who pay them no
attention.
They look exhausted, like beggars...and very old.
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
It seemed as though the Devil,
after all... had triumphed... And
then... one day....
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (played by the same actress as Valentina,
but older with different coloured hair) comes into view.
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
From the very first moment I saw
her, I was head-over-heels in love.
She was beautiful, enchanting,
delightful, young... But I... I was
several thousand years old! How
could I woo her? What could I do?

CLIFF TOP
EVENING
23
CUT TO a desolate cliff top where PERCY is struggling with DR
PARNASSUS, trying to prevent him from throwing himself off
the cliff.
PERCY
Don't be a fool! You can't die!
You're immortal! You'll just end up
broken, in the eternity ward, and
I'll be stuck looking after you!
Forever!
DR. PARNASSUS breaks free, stumbles backwards, and pitches
out into space. PERCY screams.
DR. PARNASSUS V.O.
At times like these... the devil is
never far away.

DR. PARNASSUS is hanging by his coat, snagged on a branch
angled out from the cliff face and held, like a fishing rod,
by MR NICK who has a great grin on his face.

RIVER
DAY
24
CUT TO a much younger DR. PARNASSUS and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
in a row boat, picnicking, as they float down a river. They
are in love, very happy to be together.
PERCY, wearing a blazer, flannels and straw boater is rowing
or punting.
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
The devil granted me mortality
again...and youth and great powers.
I won my bride. I was in love. But
at what price...
The boat bumps into a submerged log. DR. PARNASSUS tries to
push free. Several cigarette butts float past. Looking up,
DR. PARNASSUS sees a man sitting on the riverbank, fishing,
smoking a cigarette. It's MR NICK .
There is a loud and ominous clap of thunder.

NIGHT

A police siren howls as the wagon comes crashing around the
corner of a great rubbish tip and clatters to a halt... the
horses steaming, sections of the theatre hanging loose,
broken..an utter mess. The siren fades into the distance.

Amongst collapsed scenery PARNASSUS lies in a heap. The

VALENTINA pushes him out of the way.
VALENTINA
What were you thinking? Look what
you've done. Get out of the way!

Tony.
TONY, battered and bleeding, helps her lift PARNASSUS and
manoeuvre him to his room.

Impossible, Valentina. First to

Ssshhhh... Thanks, Tony. Leave us.

PERCY is angrily banging about, trying to repair the damage.
ANTON is trying to help but, is just getting in the way.
PERCY
Do me a favour. Take a long walk
off a short pier.
TONY arrives.
TONY
Can I help?
PERCY
Bugger off!
TONY finds ANTON sitting despondently a short way from the
wagon swigging from a bottle. He sits down next to him.
ANTON
L-leave me alone.
TONY
What were you doing to that girl
behind the mirror?

What are you suggesting?
TONY
Oh, c'mon...we all heard her
screaming.
ANTON
I was screaming as well.
It was t-
terrifying...
TONY
Terrifying? Why? I don't
understand.
ANTON
(reluctantly)
No, well...you wouldn't. You've n-
never been inside the D-Doctor's
mind have you?
TONY
Your not trying to tell me that
mind control stuff is real?
ANTON
You think it's some k-kind of scam,
d-don't you?
TONY
Isn't it?
ANTON
No... But I d-don't expect you to g-
get it... N-not in a million years.
TONY
Hang on.. if he can really control
people's minds, why isn't he ruling
the world? Why bother with this
crappy side show?
ANTON
He d-doesn't want to rule the world
d-does he?... He wants the world to
rule itself!
TONY
What a waste... Tell me about the
mirror. What's the point of that,
if not to razzle-dazzle the public?

It's a b-bloody great mystery...

enema...or do I mean, enigma...
He pulls himself up and starts to stagger off.
TONY
Er... one more thing....Does `first
to five' mean anything to you?
ANTON looks at TONY with loathing.
ANTON
I thought you were the c-clever
one.
He walks away into the darkness.
TONY sits there busily thinking.

DAWN

The morning light suffuses mountains of domestic refuse.
Rubbish for as far as the eye can see. Plastic sacks of
various colours, many spilling open. A few fires are burning.
Flocks of scavenging sea gulls hover and dive, screaming blue
murder.
On one of the many pinnacles of garbage sits a lonely figure.
It's ANTON, depressed, angry, forlorn.
The CAMERA SWINGS ROUND to show, below ANTON, in a valley of
waste material, the wagon.

PERCY has spread out the broken scenery assessing the damage.

He holds her hand.
Looks deep into her eyes.
TONY (CONT'D)
Valentina, your father seems in a
terrible state. Is it the police?
The show? Maybe I can help.
VALENTINA
I don't know what's wrong with him,
but if it's about the show...I
don't care. I'm tired of it...let
the police arrest us. I'm sick of
living like this....
She looks miserable. TONY puts his arms around her.
Holds
her tightly to him.
TONY
Don't say that. What you're doing
is important. Really important.
It's just... maybe... it should be
done in a different way.
He is about to kiss her.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S
What sort of "different" way do you
suggest?
DR. PARNASSUS, grim faced, head bandaged, steps from behind
the wagon.
TONY and VALENTINA quickly disengage.
TONY
Oh, hello, good morning sir. How
are you feeling? That was a nasty
bump on the head you got..
DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S
(beady eyed)
"Different?"
TONY
Well, sir, I've been thinking...
It's clear the show's not
attracting many people. Forgive me
but... I see two ways of tackling
this problem.

TONY (CONT'D)
Either the style of the show is at
fault... or the type of audience. I
would suggest changing both.
PERCY has appeared, dragging a damaged flat.
PERCY
Change the show!? Who the fizzing
hell do you think you are?......
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Shhh!
He sits down heavily.
TONY
I'm sorry but.. you're not modern.
People want modern. Look.
He holds open a tattered fashion magazine to a page of
beautifully photographed models in a fabulously magical
setting. He thumbs through more pages of dreamy images.
TONY (CONT'D)
This is modern. It works. Trust me,
I understand this world.
(with a wink)
This kind of mind control. Let's
try to meet the public halfway..
the right public.. and in a better
part of town.
From behind the wagon ANTON watches forlornly.
Alone and
unnoticed by the others.
PERCY
What about the filth?
TONY
(puzzled)
What?
PERCY
The filth. The police.
TONY
There'll be a better class of
police too.
PERCY
That'll be the day.

TONY
The trick is not to hide. Change
your colours. Be bold. Go where
they would least expect to find
you. I think we have been brought
together for a reason. I don't
believe in coincidence. You saved
my life. Now let me do something
in return.
PARNASSUS confers with PERCY.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Our time's nearly up... This could
be what we need.
TONY
(to Valentina)
This can be my birthday gift to
Valentina.
VALENTINA smiles and nods to PARNASSUS.
DR. PARNASSUS
Well then...
(with a burst of energy)
For God's sake let's do it!!!
PERCY
(sighs)
Yeah, okay, but what exactly do we
do?
TONY
Well... First of all, I want you to
give me your money. All of it.
What?!
PARNASSUS, PERCY, and VALENTINA look at each other.
Then PARNASSUS sees something beyond the wagon...ANTON,
downcast, heading off through the swirling plastic bags and
flying rubbish... a battered suitcase in his hand.
DR. PARNASSUS
Anton!
Where are you going?
No answer from ANTON.
VALENTINA runs after him but, he marches on silently.

Are you trying to wreck my
birthday, or what?
Anton stops, still not looking at VALENTINA he slowly drops
his suitcase.
VALENTINA (CONT'D)
Please. We need you.
Moved, ANTON turns to her.
She smiles sweetly.
VALENTINA (CONT'D)
How much money have you got?

EXT
BOND STREET
EVENING
53
Close up on Parnassus's glass plinth..now open-topped and
sitting on the edge of the stage... full of the troupe's
savings. A sign proclaims "Please Take Generously"
Directly behind the glass box is a half-globe with the
continent of Africa featured. Sitting on top is Percy
playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one
hand...his other is held out pathetically... a beggar. He's
blacked up and dressed in rags. He doesn't look happy. He
sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money.
The wagon, newly painted in sleek and stylish black and
white, stands in Bond Street or some similarly fashionable
street with expensive shops and art galleries. RICH WOMEN
anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth
glide past.
New signs proclaim `The Choice Is Yours' `The Imaginarium -
More Exclusive than ever'.
The stage, hung with soft,flowing, gauzy fabric, has been
chromatically divided in half - one side black, the other
white.
On the dark side a bloated, sun-glassed woman consuming vast
quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge. She is,
in fact, a very uncomfortable ANTON in full and fulsome drag.

Center stage stands DR. PARNASSUS dressed as a stylized
doctor with head reflector. In his hand is a staff with an
elaborate sun on the top. He is blindfolded.
On the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a
stylized Tree of Knowledge with bright red apples. Under the
tree, and reflected in the mirror, sits VALENTINA as
Eve...naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty.
She gracefully combs her hair.
Above the mirror is a sign proclaiming "The Naked Truth".
DR. PARNASSUS, peeking under his blindfold, is distinctly
uncomfortable by his daughter's lack of attire.
TONY, in a beautifully cut white suit, and wearing his
`romantic' Venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy
pose on the edge of the white side of the stage.
Nobody speaks. They pay no attention to the crowd.
A few women stop, curious. One of them takes out some money
and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go.
TONY
(retrieving the money)
Excuse me, madam. I'm afraid we
can't accept this.
The woman stops, confused. Tony hands her back her money.
TONY (CONT'D)
We are here to give...not take. We
are here to help those in need. If
it's money you need, then here it
is.
(referring to the glass
plinth)
If it's the flowering of the soul
you need, then here we are but,
unfortunately we are booked solid
at the moment. But thank you.. I
can see you have a generous spirit.
TONY returns to his pensive pose.
The women look at each
other.
WOMAN
Excuse me but, how does this work?
What does it cost?
(CONTINUED)

TONY
Cost? Money is no good in the
Imaginarium.
This is a refuge for
hearts in need of truth. A place
for souls to be purified.
WOMAN 2
How long does that take?
I'm
running late.
TONY
Madam, why should you care about
time? What are your dreams worth in
minutes?
The women grow pensive.
TONY (CONT'D)
There are hard choices to be made
in life.
(he indicates the
tableaux)
What about the dreams of the less
fortunate in the world. Do you
have time for their dreams? Or are
you like I once was...do you just
despair? Despair at all that is
wrong in the world..
(getting to his feet)
...despair at your inability to do
anything to change it.. to make it
better...I despaired so much at the
powerlessness of my own existence
that I took the easy way out...the
coward's way...I committed suicide!
Yes, that's right, I killed myself.
Can you understand my despair? But
I was saved...saved by a
miracle...The Imaginarium...and
Doctor Parnassus. He brought me
back from the dead. He gave me a
new life. A reason to live. He has
given me power to dream again... to
dream of a better world.
During his speech, more and more people have gathered. Some
are actually weeping. They are press forward putting money
in the plinth. Tony tries to stop them but, they insist.
VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY, and DR. PARNASSUS are astonished by
TONY'S performance.

Please, I'm sorry but, we're booked
solid at the moment.
A Louis Vuitton-dressed woman (60+ years old)at the back of
the crowd shouts:
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
Is that child up for adoption?
She points at the blacked up PERCY.
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)
I want to adopt that unfortunate
black child. It shouldn't be
working like this. It should be in
school.
PERCY is appalled.
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)
Who's in charge here?
The LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN looks around as a couple of POLICE
OFFICERS arrive on the scene.
TONY spots them too and heads off the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN as
she makes towards them.
TONY
Madam, congratulations, you have
been chosen.
The other WOMEN gasp.
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN

chosen. Don't miss this once-in-a-
life-time opportunity. This way.
Please.
He ushers the uneasy LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN onto the stage and
guides her upstage. PARNASSUS goes into his trance.
TONY (CONT'D)
Believe me Madam, you're the
luckiest woman in the world.
The LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN steps into the mirror. TONY
hesitates..a moment of uncertainty. VALENTINA encourages him
with a smile. He steps through.
Across the street a clock begins striking the hour.
CUT TO the two POLICE OFFICERS who start to move the crowd
and show on.
POLICEMAN
Alright, I think it's time to move
on, folks.
But on spotting the naked VALENTINA who winks at them, they
agree between themselves to give the show a bit longer.

attached to clouds - all in delicious slow motion.

love.
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)

Ohhh... What bliss... and I don't

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
Tony. How dashing.
A bar or two of tango encourages them to take a couple of
intimate tango dance steps.
Now gently wafting curtains part to reveal.. down a flower
strewn path and over a bridge... a sleazy motel with a
shingle over the door reads: "The One Night Stand Motel". In
the office window sits MR. NICK
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)
Oh, goodness me!
She bats her eyelashes at TONY and begins, knowingly, to pull
him towards the motel.
TONY
(resisting)
If I'm not wrong, I fear you must
go alone.
THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN pouts playfully, pulling him onwards.
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
Why would I want to go without you
darling?
TONY
It's one of the rules... One
imagination at a time, free from
the influence of another.

They have reached the bridge. Stairs descend to a stream.
TONY
Oh..look... another possibility..
Below them a gondola rests in the stream as small, flower
bedecked barques float past with framed pictures of romantic
heroes who died young; Keats, Shelly, Byron, James Dean,
Rudolph Valentino, Marilyn Monroe, Buddy Holly, Princess
Diana... the stream continues off into the distance to a
dark, towering Egyptian pyramid.
TONY is as bemused as THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN.
TONY (CONT'D)
You must make a choice...and...
actually, to be honest, I'd
strongly recommend this one.
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
But... Rudolph Valentino, James
Dean, Princess Di?... all these
people... they're dead.
TONY
(thinking fast)
Exactly. To be reborn, first you
must die. All of them have achieved
a kind of immortality. And we love
them all the more for it. They
won't get old or fat. They won't
get sick or feeble. They are beyond
fear. They are forever young. They
are gods. And you can join them.
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
(softening)
You're such a wonderful speaker.
The gondola awaits....with a beautiful male model at the
helm. THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN smiles at him.
TONY
There's not a moment to lose.
But as she hesitates a dark shadow rises over them. TONY,
looking past the WOMAN"S shoulder, sees the dark waters of
the stream rise up transforming into a GIGANTIC KING COBRA
that towers menacingly over them. It's wearing a BOWLER
HAT... and it's angry.

He helps THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN remove her necklace,
earrings, bracelets, rings, broach, in double quick time and
guides her onto the gondola, blowing a kiss after her.
TONY (CONT'D)
Remember nothing is permanent...
not even death.
He turns back to see the GIGANTIC KING COBRA shrinking back
below the bridge, transforming itself back into the waters of
the stream. From under the arch of the bridge hangs a rope.
At its end.. a hangman's noose.
TONY stares at it darkly disconcerted.

TONY re-enters the stage through the mirror, looking at DR.
PARNASSUS who has just come out of his trance with
astonishment
TONY
(gobsmacked)
That was so... I had no idea...
It's just... incredible.
...And then he realizes the clock is still striking the hour
realizing that only a few moments have passed since he
entered the mirror.
TONY (CONT'D)
..how do you do this?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(ignoring him and with a
big theatrical gesture)
Hooplah!
The LOUIS VUITTON woman reappears, sitting on a cut-out cloud
descending from the ceiling of the stage. She looks radiant.
She is weeping, completely overcome by her experience.
PARNASSUS steps forward and helps her to her feet. She kisses
his hands in gratitude.

Thank YOU, dear Lady, you give me
strength to continue
Born again, tearful but transcendent, the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
produces her cheque book and begins to write a cheque.
TONY is frozen, confused. The crowd is still... stunned by
the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN's transformation as she deposits the
cheque, her handbag, her expensive coat in the glass box and
glides benignly through the crowd... which parts in awe.
Pause... and then the other WOMEN rush the stage. Mayhem is
narrowly averted as TONY and PERCY manage to coral them into
a more-or-less orderly queue.
Across the street, standing in the doorway of a shop selling
luxury goods, is MR NICK. He watches events, intrigued...
...as TONY escorts a second woman through the mirror, and a
third, they descend, ecstatic, emptying the contents of their
handbags, their pearls, earrings and diamond rings into the
glass box.
TONY pays off the cops who move on.
TONY, getting more and more flamboyant, forgets to lower his
mask each time he re-enters the stage. And now a fourth woman
descends. Four successes for DOCTOR PARNASSUS.
DR. PARNASSUS
(aside to Percy)
One more to go and we're free.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS spots MR NICK across the street, smiles,
holds up four fingers.
MR NICK gives a little `I'm not impressed' smirk and turns
away and pretends to be interested in the luxury goods in the
shop window as four large dark heavy RUSSIAN MEN, all laden
with luxury shopping walk past.
One of the RUSSIANS stops..looking at the show..at TONY whose
mask is sitting on top of his head. The leading RUSSIAN
pulls him on.

TONY, reaching down to help an elderly lady up to the stage,
looks up and sees the RUSSIANS heading through the crowd..
Panic!! He pulls the mask down and begins to back up.
But it's too late, they've definitely seen him.
He spins around and rockets upstage, past DR. PARNASSUS who
is deep into his trance.
TONY dives through the mirror much to the amazement of
VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY.
The RUSSIANS chase after him, shoving the queuing WOMEN
aside, smashing the scenery and knocking ANTON into the

GREGOR (IN RUSSIAN)
There he is!!
In the distance, TONY is hiding behind some billowing fabric.
On being spotted, he takes off up a hill.
The RUSSIANS race toward the hill only to crash into a solid
wall - painted as a landscape with TONY frozen in mid stride.
Looking off to their right they see Tony heading up another
hill. But as they rush in that direction another wall rises
up blocking them. Again it is painted with a hill and TONY
frozen in midstride. A third and fourth wall rise up..
surrounding and trapping the RUSSIANS.
There is a cell door in one wall. Like crazy animals they
start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it
down. It won't budge.
While the others batter the door, GREGOR, who has been
somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, sits
quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers.
Exhausted, the other RUSSIANS collapse on the ground.
GREGOR gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and
exhales. As he does the door swings open. The other RUSSIANS
gape at him... then barrel out the door.
Outside is a new, beautiful, landscape - the sky dotted with
white fluffy clouds. Extending from the ground to each cloud
is an incredibly long ladder. On each ladder is a person
climbing upwards.
The RUSSIANS spot Tony. He is already a hundred feet up a
ladder and climbing.
Unfortunately, their way is blocked by an over-bright, hyper-
active, wide-eyed sales girl.
SALES-GIRL
Hi! Hello! Today's special! Reach
for the clouds! Discover your true
potential! Gift certificates are
available at...
The RUSSIANS roughly shove her aside.
As they rush past,
GREGOR pauses, hands her his flowers.
GREGOR
Relax...smell the flowers.

Reaching the base of TONY'S ladder, the RUSSIANS start
climbing.
Seeing the threat, TONY kicks hard and breaks the rungs below
him.. setting off a domino effect with more rungs breaking
downward towards the RUSSIANS. Snap! Crack! Rungs break in
their grasp.. they fall.
The RUSSIANS land in a tangled heap as the domino effect
continues down to the base of the ladder.
Laughing down at them, TONY turns to continue climbing - only
to see the domino effect heading down from the top of the
ladder... towards him.
THE LADDER COMPLETELY SEPARATES IN TWO.
Tony struggles to maintain his balance - and somehow manages
to get his feet on the two halves of a broken rung. Then, as
if he were on giant stilts, starts to stride away.
The RUSSIANS chase after him but, his giant strides leave
them far behind. Smugly, TONY looks back just as one of the
legs of his ladder snags on a fallen log. He loses his
balance... and plunges hundreds of feet earthward.
From nowhere, ANTON (still dressed as a fat woman) appears..
running to catch the plummeting TONY. He does and Whomp!!..
is flattened. Knocked out cold. TONY is unscathed.. his fall
broken by ANTON'S padding.
But, the RUSSIANS arrive, grab TONY, start to beat him up.
SERGE
You thieving scumbag! We break
every bone in your body!
They scrawl strange symbols on TONY'S forehead.
TONY
No! Wait! I can explain! Give me a
chance!
VLADIMIR
We want our money or you die again!
This time for good!
ANTON struggles to his feet.
ANTON
Stop it! L-leave him alone!

The RUSSIANS turn and, thinking ANTON is a fat, bossy, middle-
aged woman, hesitate.
ANTON (CONT'D)
Stand b-back! I'm warning you!
Foolishly, he whips off his wig and assumes a manly martial
arts pose. The RUSSIANS look at each other. Then, utterly
ignoring ANTON, turn their attention back to beating TONY.
GREGOR walks calmly over to ANTON who is in attack mode.
GREGOR
(bending down and picking
a flower, he offers it to
ANTON)
Relax. Smell the flowers.
Confused, ANTON takes the flower, sniffs and then... GREGOR
floors him with a powerful punch on the nose
Meanwhile, the RUSSIANS have a noose around TONY's neck and
have looped the rope over a tree branch. TONY struggles to
pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck.
He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when...
... the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helmet
rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves -
revealing DR. PARNASSUS' carved and painted face beneath.
The mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a
welcoming red carpet. From inside the giant mouth a smiling
policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in..
The terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope.
TONY drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe
flies out of his mouth.
Behind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads
"JOIN THE FUZZ.. WE LOVE VIOLENCE".. and a chorus line of
LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear -
high-kicking a snappy song and dance number.
The astonished RUSSIANS don't know what the fuck is going on.
Suddenly, a friendly OLD WOMAN'S VOICE is heard shouting
something in Russian.
Spinning around, the RUSSIANS see an old BABOUSHKA (Russian
grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily to
them. A stunned pause. Then, pell-mell, they rush to her.

RUSSIANS (IN RUSSIAN)
Mama!
Mama! Help! Save us!
As they run toward her they get smaller and smaller. She
lifts her skirts and all four disappear underneath. And
then.. BOOM!.. a muffled explosion balloons the skirts
outward. Smoke spews out from below.
Straightening her skirt, the BABOUSHKA looks up, and pulls
off her head - revealing MR.NICK's tiny head poking out of
the collar. He smiles smugly.
The giant POLICEMAN DR. PARNASSUS registers disappointment
and, like a balloon rapidly deflating, spins off into the sky
sending up a cloud of dust obscuring everything.
The dust clears and TONY and ANTON find themselves in a
desolate, empty landscape. Nowhere. Nothing.
TONY
Did you see me!! I almost reached
the clouds! I could have...it was
incredible...I was almost there...
ANTON
Shut up!
Over a distant rise the wagon appears, pulled by the horses.
ANTON drags Tony, babbling and stumbling, towards it.
TONY
I made my choice and I climbed... I
felt so much potential. I could
have done anything. I have to have
another chance...another go...I
need this...

The wagon is parked on waste ground. It looms out of nowhere

THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

The angry troupe huddles amongst the clutter of props and
jumbled scenery. TONY is on trial.
DR. PARNASSUS is sitting in a corner, head in hands. He seems
utterly destroyed.
ANTON
You're a l-liar. You've been lying
to us all along. Who are you? Who
were those thugs?
TONY
I am not a liar!
ANTON
No?
TONY
No! I just... didn't divulge
everything I knew.
PERCY
Comes to the same thing.
TONY
Absolutely not. Not in law.
ANTON
You stole their money.
TONY
No. I didn't.
ANTON
That's what they said.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

TONY
Are you going to believe them
before you believe me?
PERCY
Why not?
TONY
Because they're irredeemably bad
people, and I'm essentially good. I
know that sounds terribly prim and
arrogant and self righteous, but
I'm trying to be honest. Look, the
truth is... in order to get my
charity off the ground I needed
capital.
ANTON looks askance.
TONY (CONT'D)
(in response to Anton)
Yes, I know, and you're right, but
that's the way the grown-up..the
real world works. You can't make
omelettes without soiling your
hands. Or should that be the other
way round? Anyway, I - with
hindsight very foolishly - accepted
a loan from people who seemed to
me, at the time, to be very decent
and sincere. There was absolutely
no way I could have known that they
were part of a ruthless organised
crime syndicate and that they
wanted to use my charity to launder
money. I made a mistake. And I have
to live with that. I'm sorry. What
more can I say?
VALENTINA wants to believe TONY. ANTON and PERCY don't.
VALENTINA
(distressed but basically
sympathetic)
Oh Tony.
TONY
But, can we not talk about me for a
moment.. I want to thank the Doctor
for letting me experience the most
sublime, inspiring ....

ANTON
So why were they trying to k-kill
you? "Again!" is what they said.
TONY
What?
ANTON
(answering his own
question)
The first time they hung you from
the b-bridge... right?... B-because
you stole their money.
TONY
Stop saying that! I didn't steal
it! I didn't have it. I'd had to
invest in infrastructure. I needed
more time. When you run a charity
you have to give lots of money
away. You wouldn't believe the red
tape. The Charity Commission are a
bunch of fascists. It's incredible.
I mean... c'mon give me a break...I
almost died today.. and I said I'm
sorry... and anyway..... this was
supposed to be a special day...it's
Valentina's birthday.
He pulls out the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN'S beautiful necklace
from his pocket.
TONY (CONT'D)
Happy birthday. For a beautiful
woman.
He puts it around Valentina's neck. VALENTINA smiles.
ANTON
glowers.
ANTON
The marks on your face...
TONY
Marks?
ANTON
They scrawled something on your
forehead. Symbols... Signs...
TONY looks uncomfortable, tries to rub his forehead clean.

You had some of those when we
rescued you.
ANTON
Yes, what's that about?
But, before he can say anything, there's a knock on the door
which startles everyone. They exchange looks.
DR. PARNASSUS is frightened but hides this from the others.
The knock is repeated. PERCY starts to get up.
DR. PARNASSUS
(sotto voce)
No! Leave it!
PERCY sits down.
The knock comes again.
VALENTINA
(sotto voce to the DR.
PARNASSUS)
Who is it?
DR. PARNASSUS
(sotto voce)
It's too late... for visitors.
Once more someone knocks. Everyone is edgy. Particularly
PERCY.
The knock comes again.
PERCY
(sotto voce, agitated)
Please can we answer the door? I
can't stand not answering the door,
or the telephone, or whatever. It's
not in my nature. I won't sleep for
weeks if we don't answer the door!
Sorry!
DR. PARNASSUS gets up, goes to the door, opens it and steps
outside, closing the door behind him.

The horses are standing steaming nearby.
DR. PARNASSUS
(very down)
I know... It's over....you've
won...
MR NICK
Four rotten Russkies?
DR. PARNASSUS
And the girl..from the pub.
MR NICK shakes his head.
MR NICK
Sally doesn't count.
Do you, gal?
SALLY (the woman thrown out from the wagon as they escaped
from the pub mob) steps out of the shadows, puts her arms
around NICK
DR. PARNASSUS
You're joking... toying with me.
Like a cat with a mouse... As is
your privilege.
MR NICK
Sal didn't get to make a real
choice. You were gaga. Out for the
count. Wouldn't be fair...And
you've got four, thanks to your
friend Tony. So... we're even...
it's not quite over.
He smiles, lights a cigarette, takes a deep drag...

Not quite.

VALENTINA (V.O.)
Father?
DR. PARNASSUS looks round to find VALENTINA standing next to
him. He starts to round up the horses.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Valentina... my darling girl. We
must do another show! Now! Quickly!
Get ready to move out!
VALENTINA
Who was that?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Somebody asking the way. Where's
Tony?
VALENTINA
I overheard you... He wasn't asking
the way.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Please! Get everybody together.
Another show! Tony! Percy!
VALENTINA
I want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(harnessing the horses)
Not now.
VALENTINA
Yes, now! I want to know the truth!

It's something to do with that
bloody rambling story you were
telling me the night we found Tony
isn't it?
PARNASSUS sighs. Stops. He checks his watch
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Yes.
VALENTINA
So tell me.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
What I told you was... the truth.
I really am thousands of years old.
I have been immortal. I have been
mortal. And I have had many
dealings with the devil. Too many.
VALENTINA
(fearful)
What are you saying?...
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Remember the woman I was telling
you about?.. the one I was so
desperately in love with.. so in
love that I made a deal with the
devil? That was your mother...
...she was so beautiful, so
enchanting...so...
Looking at VALENTINA, DR. PARNASSUS sees her morph into the
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN appearing. He almost swoons.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
... so young. She was everything I
had ever dreamed of. I made a
choice. I bargained away my
immortality. I regained my youth...
and I won her. I did! I won her...!
The BEAUTIFUL WOMAN morphs back into VALENTINA.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)

DR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and
loses his balance.

I can't say it.
VALENTINA
Say it.
DR. PARNASSUS

DR. PARNASSUS
I was mortal again... on condition
that... any children I fathered...
would, on their sixteenth
birthday... belong to him.
VALENTINA

VALENTINA can't take it in.
VALENTINA (CONT'D)
But... didn't...
DR. PARNASSUS
Your mother never knew. She died

wretched stories... A cruel story!

A new wager... The first of five.
If I win... you're free... you're
mine again.. and we can win!
Where's Tony? We can still win!
VALENTINA
By playing games with the devil!?
DR. PARNASSUS
With one more show. The day isn't
over.
VALENTINA
No!
DR. PARNASSUS
Valentina.
VALENTINA
All my life you've made me play
`Beauty', `Truth', `Justice'...
filled my head with dreams and high
ideals. All that crap! While... all
the time...! The devil was right!
You're arrogant! Vain and arrogant!
I'm just another one of your stupid
wagers!... You're beneath contempt.
She rushes off into the dark night.

He starts to violently bang his head against the side of the
wagon.
Suddenly the stage begins to unfold. PARNASSUS looks up,
unable to see what or who is doing this. He drunkenly
stumbles around the side to see TONY pulling ropes.

I'll take the risk to save
Valentina and, hopefully, you sir.
We've still got a few minutes.
Tony steers DOCTOR PARNASSUS towards his glass column.

Yes! Yes! Of course! Of course!
Thank God! Thank God!

How about thanking me?
DR. PARNASSUS
What?

Oh God!... Doctor... We can save
her.. you and me. I need this. We
both need this. Please. The trance.

Don't cry. It's going to be

Mist and rain descend as TONY and VALENTINA run through the
darkened shapes of the shampoo-commercial landscape - now
tattered, ragged, and wind blown. Darkness reigns.
TONY
This isn't right. This is all
wrong. Which way?
Soaked and cold they spy a welcome sight. A uniformed valet
with an open umbrella stands by the door of a sleek limo.
VALET
Your car is here, Mr.Tony.
TONY
Ah, Lester, just in time.
TONY ducks under the umbrella and helps VALENTINA into the
car ahead of himself.
As she slides across the seat she notices the driver - bowler
hatted and smoking a cigarette.
VALENTINA
No! Tony, don't get in! Get away!
She pushes TONY back and scrambles out...dragging him back
out into the dark rain.
The driver turns around.
It's MR.NICK.. looking vexed.
VALENTINA and TONY struggle through the rain. Suddenly, they
find themselves in deep water up to their chests. They are
sinking. Through the mist they see a boat. It is the gondola
that transported the LOUIS VUITTON LADY.

VALENTINA recoils, drags TONY off the boat.
TONY
Stop! What are you doing!
We'll
drown!
VALENTINA
No we won't. This is the way.
She points to jumbled rocks just visible in the darkness.
They drag themselves onto them. The rocky monoliths appear
to be the same as the landscape ANTON climbed over when he
was searching for DIEGO, the son of THE FAMILY FROM HELL.
And, like a repeat of that experience, from behind the ridge
rises the Parnassus-faced Mongolfier balloon. But, now the
eyes stream tears and rain pours down. In the basket is
ANTON.
ANTON
Don't d-do it. Don't g-go on. Not
with him! He's all lies.
VALENTINA
Just like my father. Leave me
alone. I don't care anymore. I want
a new life.
TONY

He pulls her away..towards a little tumble-down cottage. Warm
candlelight glows in the windows, smoke curls from the
chimney. They run to the door. TONY bangs on it. Someone
can be heard unlatching the locks inside.
A child's crying cuts through the wind.
VALENTINA turns and sees a little girl sitting on the path...
among flapping laundry. She rushes to her, tries to pick her
up but, the little girl resists..

Behind him, in the warmth, stands the old BABOUSHKA.
Seeing that VALENTINA is really struggling with the little
girl, TONY reluctantly goes to help. The little girl, on
seeing TONY, tries to break away but, he holds on to her.
TONY (CONT'D)

Ostanobuite bas menshi schit!
The litle girl goes quiet. VALENTINA looks at TONY with
surprise. The BABOUSHKA looks angry. Suddenly a light begins
to suffuse TONY and the little girl. A small orchestra can
be heard playing garden party music.
VALENTINA
You did it! You made the right
choice!

They are dressed in ethnic clothes. TONY takes OLGA'S
hand...offers the little boy's hand to VALENTINA. She takes
it in her own. The four of them start to walk to the door
leading to the ballroom.
TONY (CONT'D)
(looking to everyone)
This is a vitally important moment
for the future of the Foundation.
The children of the world are
depending on us.

Anton!?
TONY and VALENTINA look around. ANTON is nowhere to be seen
but, his voice continues.
ANTON (V.O.)
All of this is false! It's nothing
to do with you! It's all him. It's
his imagination!
TONY
Call security, somebody.
ANTON (V.O.)
It's all rotten! A naked lie!
You've got to understand!
The LITTLE BOY is tugging VALENTINA'S arm.
She looks down.
It's ANTON. A child-size ANTON.
ANTON (CONT'D)
Look at this...
He produces the newspaper with TONY'S photo and news story.
ANTON (CONT'D)
...`Tony Liar'..
TONY
What?
How?...
TONY lunges for him but, ANTON dodges out of the way.
ANTON
(reading and dodging)
'The disgraced director of the
children's charity "Suffer the

TONY has grabbed little ANTON and starts hitting him.
TONY
And now he doesn't stutter! You
see!? It was all an act to get
cheap sympathy!
VALENTINA
(pulling TONY off ANTON)
Take your hands off him!! Stop it!
TONY
Get off me! What are you doing?
(lashing out and hitting
VALENTINA in the face)
You've betrayed me! Haven't you?
You let him in...into my world, you
bitch!?.. after all I've lavished
on you...OW!!
Little ANTON has leapt on TONY's back and sunk his teeth into
TONY'S ear. TONY throws him off and starts beating him.

THE BALLROOM

In the glittering ballroom a children's choir sings.
CHILDREN'S CHOIR
"We are the world..we are the
children..."
Behind the choir the double doors of the ballroom crash
open... exposing TONY violently beating up an `ethnic child.'
Stunned silence as the horror of this happy scene sinks in.
Then...
GUESTS
My God! Somebody stop him!
He's a
monster! Get him!
As one they leap to their feet.

TONY looks up and freezes. At the same time the walls of the
ballroom begin to crack and disintegrate. TONY'S world starts
to fall apart... literally.
The floor around TONY falls away into an abyss leaving only a
narrow escape route. He hurls ANTON aside and dashes away as
the GUESTS pursue him. ANTON avoids being trampled but,
loses his footing and falls over the edge.
VALENTINA
Anton!!!
VALENTINA, fighting through the angry GUESTS, rushes to the
edge of the abyss. ANTON is struggling to hold on to a
broken floor joist that protrudes several feet down from the
side of the cliff face.
ANTON
Valentina!..help me. Please.
His grip slips. VALENTINA reaches for him, grasps his hand.
VALENTINA
Forgive me, Anton. I was wrong.
ANTON
I know... I'm not a child.
And.. ANTON REVERTS TO HIS NORMAL SIZE...AND WEIGHT.
ANTON (CONT'D)
I love you, Valentina.
ANTON slips out of her grip, plummeting into the abyss.
VALENTINA
Noooo!
Suddenly, VALENTINA is jerked backwards by her hair.
TONY
Who's behind this!? Eh!? You didn't
come up with this all on your own
did you!!!???
(slapping her)
No! Someone's got at you. Someone's
paid you!!!... Who!!!??? Tell me!!!
DR. PARNASSUS(O.S.)
Valentina! My darling daughter!
There you are!

They turn to see PARNASSUS in the distance (where once the
ballroom stood) stumbling towards them, drunk, desperate. As
he moves forward a new landscape is created behind him.
TONY rushes towards PARNASSUS.
TONY
You old bastard! This is all your
doing!
DR. PARNASSUS
(drunkenly)
All my doing?... I'm merely the
facilititatater, dear boy.
GUESTS (O.S.)
There he is! Stop him! Leave her
alone. Get him!
Throwing his arm around TONY, PARNASSUS spins him around to
face the MOB rushing towards him.
DR. PARNASSUS
I create the opportunities. Is it
my fault if your not up to it?
Tony wrenches his arm free and violently shoves the drunken
DOCTOR right into the path of the frenzied MOB. PARNASSUS is
trampled underfoot in their rush to catch TONY.
VALENTINA
Father! No!
PARNASSUS'S body lies broken on the ground. Frantically,
VALENTINA rushes to him, throwing herself on her father's
battered body, sobbing hysterically.
VALENTINA (CONT'D)
NO..NO NO... Please.. father..it's
all my fault. What have I done?...
With siren wailing, an AMBULANCE arrives, screeching to a
halt. PARAMEDICS pull VALENTINA away. They check PARNASSUS
for signs of life and begin to lift him onto the gurney.
VALENTINA can't control herself and tries to throw herself
onto his body. The PARAMEDICS struggle with her.
PARAMEDIC
(with a severe stutter)
P-p-p-lease m-mis-s, there's-s
n-n-othing y-y-y-you c-can d-d-o,
he-he-he's d-d-dead...

VALENTINA
NOOOOO...!!!
VALENTINA wrenches herself out of their grasp howling like an
animal and rushes away out of earshot before the PARAMEDIC
can finish speaking.
PARAMEDIC
...d-dead drunk.
A bottle falls from the DOCTOR'S hand and explodes in a
million fragments as it hits the ground.
The shimmering fragments coalesce into a fractured mirror
corridor down which a multi-reflected VALENTINA runs -
sobbing like a madwoman - lashing out at her reflections,
some of which are flashbacks of her flirting with TONY,
irritated with ANTON, angry with PARNASSUS.
VALENTINA
(to her reflections)
You little fool! You're to blame!..
for everything... I hate you!
The multi-reflection broken mirror corridor ends at two
mirrors identical to the one used in the Imaginarium. The one
to the left is marked 'His' with a bowler hat, the other to
the right 'Hers' with a bonnet. She hesitates.
VALENTINA (CONT'D)
(laughing madly)
So this is to be my choice!!
MR NICK appears out of the "His" mirror - a burst of flame
behind him.
He makes a sweeping gesture inviting VALENTINA to enter the
mirror marked 'Hers'.
VALENTINA, heads for the mirror marked 'His'. MR NICK blocks
her path.
MR NICK
Now, there's absolutely no need for
that. That's just plain
contrariness.
VALENTINA tries to get around him.

MR NICK (CONT'D)
You think you deserve punishment
but you're a kid - you have no
idea...trust me.
VALENTINA feints another direction. MR NICK blocks her.
VALENTINA
(a crazed look)
Wrong. I'm 16...I'm a woman now..
She spins around him...he blocks....a kind of dance between
them begins - confusingly reflected in the mirrors. A tango
can be heard.
VALENTINA (CONT'D)
...a selfish bitch, everyone I love
dies...I'm...
MR NICK
...only fit for hell? If only.
He looks at Valentina with lascivious intent. He's tempted,
briefly, but resists it.
MR NICK (CONT'D)
No... your pop would never speak to
me again. And that'd be a shame.
Let's dance.
Reflected in the swirling mirror fragments, they tango until
he spins her towards the right hand mirror. She sails through
- and, with a mad smile, throws him a kiss.
The mirror closes with a burst of flame. The briefest flash
of DR. PARNASSUS face is reflected in the mirror fragments.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S
Valentina!!!!!!
MR NICK turns, realizing he has been looking into a mirror
fragment reflecting the two mirrors. The writing on the
Valentina's mirror reads "His".
MR NICK
Damn!... I've won.

EXT
STRANGE
MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE

DR. PARNASSUS is sitting alone on a prominent bluff (the same
one he tried throwing himself off many years ago) He's
distraught. Tears run down this cheeks. A distant bell tolls
midnight.
MR NICK appears behind PARNASSUS...sits down beside him.
MR NICK
Funny how things work out, isn't
it?
He lights a cigarette.
MR NICK (CONT'D)
It's not what I had in mind
y'know... this.. Valentina, being
the fifth... It doesn't seem
right... She's supposed to be the
prize, the star prize... not part
of the bloody score... And you
lumbered with eternal life all over
again... What a bummer, eh?
No response from PARNASSUS. A Tarot cards drops from his
hand. It is The Hanged Man.
MR. NICK points to the plain far below. Across the harsh
ground, TONY is running for his life...pursued by the MOB.
MR NICK (CONT'D)
I hope they get that bastard. Tear
him limb from limb... But they
won't... He leads a charmed life,
that one... I've been trying to
nail him for years... I thought I
had him this time. But, there's
always some prat comes to his
rescue... Talk about the luck of
the Devil.
(he laughs)
Those weird markings you found on
him... on his forehead... Those
satanic-symbol, so-called,
things... What's all that about?...
Maybe they protect him in some
way... I've never been into that
black-magic stuff myself... Can't
seem to get the hang of it... I
know, pathetic isn't it?...

PARNASSUS ignores him, sunk even deeper into despondency.
MR NICK (CONT'D)
God, I hate to see you like this.
Look, I tell you what... If you can
get the lowdown on those satanic
markings, or.. wait.. better
still, if you can wipe that self-
righteous little creep off the face
of the universe... I'll give you
Valentina back.
A beat. Slowly, PARNASSUS looks up.
MR NICK (CONT'D)
How about it?

EXT
SOMEWHERE ON THE MOUNTAIN

TONY, sweating, panting for breath, is running up the
mountain.
Below, the MOB is still in hot pursuit.
TONY reaches the summit. In front of him, is his salvation -
an empty gibbet. A noose hangs from the crossbeam.
TONY
Thank God for that!
TONY relaxes a little.
We can hear the mob now, struggling up the mountain.
TONY digs into one of his pockets and pulls out the brass
tube that he has always kept close.
TONY opens his mouth and is about to slip the tube down his
throat when he spots the Hanged Man Tarot card lying at his
feet. A hand from behind him snatches the tube away.
TONY, startled, turns to find himself looking up at DR.
PARNASSUS.
PARNASSUS is standing on a chair with the noose around his
neck. He smiles and opens his hand. The metal tube has
vanished.
TONY panics. The MOB is getting closer.

With his other hand DR. PARNASSUS produces the tube from
TONY'S ear.
TONY (CONT'D)
(desperate)
Give me that!
DR. PARNASSUS gestures at the CROWD.
DR. PARNASSUS
Give us a moment, please.
The CROWD goes into very slow motion...but twice as angry.
DR. PARNASSUS teases TONY with magic.
DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
Here's your tube... Here's mine.
(producing a second tube)
But mine's just a cheap
counterfeit... Look, it breaks...
(he breaks it)
But here's another...
TONY
Stop!
DR. PARNASSUS
You're not amused?
TONY
(desperate)
You've been talking to the devil,
haven't you? Let me guess what he
said... If you manage to kill me,
he'll release Valentina. Yes? Am I
right?... I am aren't I? It's all
lies. He can't release her. And why
not? Because he doesn't have her.
He can't have her because she's the
prize.
(gaining confidence)
He doesn't have five wins. But if
you kill me he will, won't he?
You'll have lost Valentina forever!
DR. PARNASSUS does a double hand shuffle.
DR. PARNASSUS
Choose.

TONY chooses.
TONY
You've got to believe me! For all
our sakes!
DR. PARNASSUS
Are you sure you made the right
choice?
TONY
Look...
DR. PARNASSUS
Let's find out.
He slides the tube down his throat and kicks the chair away.
He drops... dangles from the rope...the noose tight around
his neck.
At the same moment, the MOB resumes normal speed and roars up
the mountain.
Is PARNASSUS dead?
Working very fast, TONY hoists him over his shoulder and
wrestles the noose loose. He drops PARNASSUS on the ground.
He's stunned but still alive.
The MOB is closing in.
TONY slaps DR. PARNASSUS hard between the shoulder blades.
The tube pops out of the DOCTOR'S gullet. TONY catches it.
TONY
Gotcha!
TONY swallows the tube as the MOB surge around the gibbet,
grabbing him, beating him, and then lifting him onto the
chair, tightening the noose around his neck.

Although battered, TONY winks smugly at DR. PARNASSUS, but
his mood changes when he sees DR. PARNASSUS spit out several
more fake tubes, then, gagging, force the real one up and out
of his gullet.
With a look of realization and horror, TONY drops to his
death as the MOB kicks the chair away from under him.
The MOB cheers. Yes, he's dead.
DR. PARNASSUS tosses the metal tube to MR NICK who steps
coolly out of the MOB, cigarette in his mouth.
DR. PARNASSUS
(hoarsely)
There are three cardinal rules.
One, there's no black-magic, only
cheap tricks. And... er... I forget
the others. Now, where's my
daughter?
MR NICK
How should I know? You're her
father.
(with needle)
Her loving father.
DR PARNASSUS looks askance at MR NICK.
MR NICK (CONT'D)
She's free... isn't she?
MR NICK smiles and blows smoke in PARNASSUS'S face. The smoke
fills the screen and becomes...

DESERT
DAY

... a dust storm. The wind is howling. The swirling dust
thins to reveal DR.PARNASSUS, alone, exhausted, trudging
across a vast desert.
He's tormented by his thoughts.
DR. PARNASSUS
What else could I do, Valentina?
What else could I have done... What
other choice could I have made?...
Damn!... It was the right choice...
Of course it was... Of course...
But where are you?

Where's my beautiful daughter?
Where's my darling? How long must I
suffer?
There is no proper road, only endless sand, but nevertheless
DR. PARNASSUS reaches a signpost which indicates two distinct
paths.
One leads to a tidy little suburban home, the other up an
dramatic mountain pass via a painfully steep staircase cut
into the rock (the same one that MARTIN THE DRUNK chose not
to climb days earlier.
DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
No, no, no... No more choices,
please... No more choices...!!!
Enraged, he tries to push the sign over, but is too feeble.
Exhausted, he subsides onto a smooth protruding stone.
VOICE (V.O.)
(angry)
Hey!
DR. PARNASSUS, alarmed, rolls quickly off the stone.
Now on his knees he finds himself looking at the top half of
PERCY'S head and face. What he'd thought was a stone was, in
fact, his old companion buried in the sand.
DR. PARNASSUS
Percy!
DR. PARNASSUS, overjoyed, begins to dig PERCY out.
PERCY
About bloody time!
DR. PARNASSUS
Where have you been?
PERCY
(irritated)
Here!
DR. PARNASSUS
How long have you been here?
PERCY
How long's a piece of string? Don't
ask daft questions.

PERCY
Problematical my arse! Come on... I
know it's against the grain...
PERCY grabs DR. PARNASSUS'S cloak and begins to pull him
across the sand in the direction of the bungalow. We can now
see the sign reads `Easy'...
DR. PARNASSUS
(on his dignity)
No! Suburban bungalows and all that
they evoke are anathema to me.
Dammit Percy! Stop! I've got my
pride!
PERCY
Yeah, it goes just before the fall.
PERCY grabs DR. PARNASSUS'S cloak and begins to pull him
across the sand in the direction indicated by the sign which
we can now see reads 'Easy'..
PERCY (CONT'D)
Come on... I know it's against the

PERCY pulls the reluctant DR. PARNASSUS up the drive of a
suburban bungalow, past a perfect lawn and double garage, to
the front door.
PERCY rings the bell.
DR. PARNASSUS tries to make a run for it but PERCY holds him
fast.
The door is opened by VALENTINA. She's older and is carrying
a BABY in her arms.
Both DR. PARNASSUS and VALENTINA are astonished. Neither
