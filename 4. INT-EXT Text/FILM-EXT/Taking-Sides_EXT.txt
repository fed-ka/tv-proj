Steve's car swerves round the corner and comes to a halt.
A small crowd watch workmen on ladders hammering away at a
stone swastika above the portico. American soldiers
supervise. Steve gets out of the car, carrying an attache
case, and he, too, watches as the stone swastika falls and
crashes into pieces on the road. One or two people clap,
most just stare.
The American soldiers immediately hoist the Stars and
Stripes. Steve goes into the building. The sentry salutes.
The driver of the car goes to the trunk and takes out a
labelled duffel bag, cans of film, a case which holds a 16-
mm projector. A small BOY sidles up to him:
BOY
Cigarettes, chewing gum?
Freezing weather. A narrow street, crowded, busy, noisy.
Some makeshift stalls set out, trestle tables, open
suitcases, people buying and selling every imaginable
commodity.
Emmi wanders through the crowd, passing a violinist, Helmuth
Rode, wrapped up against the cold, playing Handel's Air on
a G String, a bowl for money at his feet. A passer-by drops
a cigarette butt in it.
Immediately, Rode retrieves the
butt.
Emmi comes to a stall selling piles of gramophone records.
She asks the stallholder a question. He points to another
stall across the way.
In the back, David and Steve. Military driver. The car's
making its way along a road that skirts a lake towards a
grand mansion from which fly the four Allied flags.
STEVE
You think a whole orchestra, what,
a hundred and forty or so guys,
could be orchestrated?
DAVID
I guess it's possible.
STEVE
So, what does the Russki want?
DAVID
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially
to see you.
STEVE
'Dim-shits'?
Outside the club room for the participants. Buzz of
conversation, clink of glasses, cups. The terrace is
deserted.
A waiter carries a tray with various refreshments to a
quiet corner where Dymshitz, Green, Vernay, his aide
LIEUTENANT SIMON, Steve and David sit in comfortable
armchairs. The waiter serves them. During this:
DYMSHITZ
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz.
I'm glad to see you.
STEVE
Colonel. Pleasure.
DYMSHITZ
So, Major, tell me, have you
questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
STEVE
Not yet.
DYMSHITZ
I've had two meetings with him.
He's a great musician. Maybe the
greatest conductor in the world.
His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert -
unequalled.
Steve makes a non-committal gesture.
DYMSHITZ
I'll come straight to point. I've
offered him a very attractive
position. Conductor of the
Staatsoper Unten den Linden. He
refused. But I want him. I want
him badly. And I want your help.
GREEN
Hey, just a moment, you should
have discussed this with me first.
DYMSHITZ
I'm discussing it with you now.
Major, I want you to drop your
investigation, save everybody time
and trouble.
GREEN
We can't drop a case just like
that.
DYMSHITZ
I'll give you another conductor in
exchange or writer, musician, actor
what...what do you care?
But I
like Furtwngler. He's my favourite
conductor.
(chuckles.)
Mine and Hitler's. He's our
favourite conductor.
The tram packed to overflowing. Then, a sudden stir among
the passengers as people push through trying to find space.
One of them is FURTWNGLER. He's recognised. Whispering.
He stares ahead or keeps his eyes downcast. An elderly man
tugs at his coat, half-rises, offering his seat.
Furtwngler manages a smile and shakes his head. The tram
rattles on.
Summer evening. The first movement of Schubert's String
Quintet in C Major, D956, played by three men and two women
to a large audience packed into the ruins, partly open to
the sky, Dymshitz
among them.
At the rear of the church, Emmi and David, enraptured,
seated side by side.
The first movement ends and the Adagio begins. After the
music gathers momentum:
Rain. Thunder and lightning. The musicians continue to
play, unperturbed.
They are coming to the end of the
Quintet.
David and Emmi huddled together. Some umbrellas up and
then movement which catches David's attention. He nudges
Emmi, I indicates with his chin.
People have moved to reveal Furtwngler: seated, wearing a
hat, still I' as a statue, soaked, listening,
expressionless.
Much applause. The musicians bow. The audience start to
leave.
Emmi and David emerge from the ruins.
Furtwngler passes
them.
They nod awkwardly. He doesn't respond but is about to
walk on when Dymshitz pushes through, nods to David, who
salutes. Dymshitz catches up with Furtwngler. They are
near to Emmi and David.
DYMSHITZ
Dr. Furtwngler -
Furtwngler stops.
DYMSHITZ
Moving, you agree? Whenever I hear
Schubert I am moved.
You agree?
FURTWNGLER
The tempi were a little too correct
for my taste. But I expect that is
because of the rain.
He nods politely, is about to go -
DYMSHITZ
(also for David's
benefit)
Wait, Doctor, I understand you
have difficulties with the
Americans. I want you to know, I
am your champion. We can help.
Furtwngler allows himself a faint smile, tips his hat,
and then hurries off into the night. Dymshitz goes, too.
David and Emmi watch them.
Then:
EMMI
(frowning, worried)
What does he mean, too correct?
DAVID
I don't know.
Huddled under their umbrella, they dash off.
Steve lies, shirt off, taking the sun. Children playing.
Noise behind him of someone in the bushes. Steve doesn't
move.
Rode, carrying a slender leather case, pushes through to
Steve, who remains with his eyes closed.
RODE
Major.
STEVE
(eyes still closed)
Helmuth.
RODE
Guess what I am holding in my hand.
You like guessing games?
STEVE
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What
are you holding in your hand?
Rode takes from the case a conductor's baton. Steve opens
one eye.
RODE
It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which
I stole.
STEVE
The one he kept in his right hand.
Yes, you remember.
RODE
Yes, you remember.
STEVE
How could I forget?
Sits up, takes the baton. Somewhere a child laughs; suddenly
Steve thrusts the baton at Rode.
STEVE
Show me.
RODE
Show you?
STEVE
Yeah, show me, I want to see you
do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're
the maestro, and you have the baton
in your right hand, but you give
me the salute just the same.
RODE
Not here, Major, there are people,
if anybody should see... please,
please, Major...
STEVE
Do it, Helmuth.
After nervous looks over his shoulder Rode, salutes half-
heartedly.
STEVE
Do it right.
Rode thrusts his hand out in the Nazi salute.
People by the lake:
Mostly elderly, but some younger ones see Rode saluting.
Some turn away. Others stare.
STEVE'S VOICE
You look great doing that.
Rode and Steve:
Rode looks around nervously, lowers his arm.
STEVE
And I see what you mean. You nearly
poked my eyes out.
RODE
Exactly.
Replaces the baton, gives
Steve the case.
STEVE
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our
secret.
A ball comes bounding towards them. Steve catches it. Then
a BOY runs in, looks hopeful.
BOY
Mister, mister, here, here,
mister!!!
Steve tosses the ball back to him.
STEVE
Great catch, kid. The boy runs
off.
RODE
So. You wanted to see me.
Steve pats the spot next to him and Rode sits.
RODE
You usually don't work on Sunday,
Major?
STEVE
All in the cause of humanity,
Helmuth. Or should I call you one-
zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
RODE
What?
STEVE
One-zero-four-nine-three-three-
one. Or d'you mind if I just call
you 'one'?
Rode makes an attempt to go but Steve grabs him.
STEVE
You know what I say you are,
Helmuth? I say you're a piece of
shit.
Rode suddenly starts to retch.
RODE
That bastard!
People by the lakeside:
Faces turning at Rode's sobs. Impassive. Blank.
Steve and Rode:
STEVE
Who's the bastard, Helmuth? Hinkel?
Rode nods.
STEVE
Why? He promised to remove your
file?
Rode vomits.
STEVE
And what about before that? What
were you a member of in Austria?
After a moment:
STEVE
Was a member of...?
Speak up?
RODE
(barely audible)
I was a member of the Communist
Party. I was a communist. That's
what Hinkel had over me. He knew
everything. He held that over me.
That's how he made me co-operate.
STEVE
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate.
And now are you a communist again?
RODE
(angry)
You don't know what it's like to
wake up every single morning of
your life terrified, you don't
know that -
(he stops.)
Brief silence. Steve stands.
Further along the lakeside:
Steve and Rode walk. People about. Boats on the lake.
RODE
I would never, in my wildest dreams,
have ever been a second violinist
in the Berlin Philharmonic. When
they got rid of the... the Jews in
the orchestra, it gave people like
me a chance.
Rode rowing Steve in a small boat. Rode, exhausted, stops.
The boat drifts. Steve watches him for a moment, then:
STEVE
Helmuth, you ever heard of plea-
bargaining?
Rode, trying to catch his breath, shakes his head.
STEVE
Talk about power, I have the power
to give you work, make your life
easier. Your past won't be
mentioned. I could give you a job
tomorrow but I have to get something
in return. See, Helmuth? That's
plea-bargaining.
No response. Rode keeps his head bowed.
STEVE
I can give you freedom of movement,
freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth.
But I need something in return.
RODE
Major, we're discussing a man of
genius, I don't want...
STEVE
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to
discuss symbols here?
This guy
was a front man. He was the piper,
but he played their tune, you get
my philosophical meaning?
I'm not
interested in small fish, I'm after
Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard
facts.
Silence. Then Rode slowly raises his head.
RODE
The only thing I know is he's an
anti-Semite.
STEVE
Of course. You, too. Like everyone
else in this goddamn country.
Rode and Steve walking. Rode suddenly turns to him:
RODE
I've remembered something else...
STEVE
Yeah?
RODE
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram
for his birthday.
STEVE
He did?
RODE
One of your people told me.
STEVE
One of my people?
They start to walk away from the water.
RODE
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew.
He said he'd seen the telegram in
the Chancellery.
STEVE
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the
corporal and we'll find the
telegram.
He stops, takes out a cigarette, offers one to Rode, lights
them both, gives Rode the packet.
They smoke for a moment.
STEVE
But I need documentary proof. You
know of anything like that?
RODE
No. But that's why we hated him.
We admired him as a conductor but
we all hated him too because he
didn't have to join the Party and
yet he had a better life than any
of us. He didn't have to go and
deliver a report after every trip
abroad. He got everything from
them, everything. He was filthier
than any of us Party members.
The sun is setting. Rode stops suddenly.
RODE
There's a rumour... I don't know
if it's true or not... but ask him
about von der Null.
STEVE
Never heard of him, who is he?
RODE
Edwin von der Null. Music critic.
He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews
while he raved about Herbert von
Karajan.
STEVE
Who's he?
RODE
Also a conductor. Very brilliant.
Young. Von der Null called him
'The Miracle von Karajan'.
Furtwngler was outraged and they
say he had von der Null conscripted
into the army. The same thing
happened to another critic. True
or not, it's not such a bad idea.
Critics give you bad reviews, you
have them sent to the Russian front.
(Chuckks.)
But if you really want to get
Furtwngler, ask him about Herbert
von Karajan.
STEVE
The Miracle Kid.
RODE
Yes, yes you may notice that he
cannot even bring himself to utter
his name, he... he refers to him
as K.
Rode tries to make up his mind about something, then
decides. He reaches into an inside pocket and takes out a
small black notebook.
RODE
And ask him about his private life.
STEVE
His private life?
Rode hesitates, then he hands Steve the black book.
RODE
Yes, it's all in here. His women.
A half-ruined caf with tables on the sidewalk. WERNER,
the timpanist, SCHLEE, the oboist, and two others seated
at one of the tables, drinking coffee.
David carries an attach case and walks towards the caf.
He scans the people at the tables, sees the musicians and
approaches. They stand.
WERNER
Lieutenant Wills.
David nods
WERNER
Herr Schlee, timpanist, Herr Romer,
cello and Herr Schmidt, viola.
They are willing to help. We have
already ordered ourselves coffee.
I hope you...
DAVID
Yeah, of course.
WERNER
The whole orchestra will vouch for
him. He was always there to support
us.
DAVID
We need names, if possible with
addresses, because it's urgent.
Names of musicians saved by Dr.
Furtwngler, people he helped to
escape abroad. Let's go somewhere
public.
David leaves money on the table and then walks off with
the four men. They talk as they make their way down a side
street.
FLEA MARKET - DAY
Bright summer's day. Emmi pushing her way through the
crowded market. She comes to the stall with gramophone
records.
David is with her, staying behind a little so as not to
disturb her.
She starts to look through the records, blowing her nose
from time to time. Then she finds a box of records, opens
it, is delighted. She bargains with the stallholder, and
she hands over money.
She shows her purchase to David happily. They struggle on
in the crowd. David suddenly stops. He has spotted a tandem.
The bicycle with two seats is old and rusty but seems to
be in working order. David steps up to it, touches it.
Two persons, Emmi and David, riding the tandem. Emmi in
the front, pedalling, David behind. The road going up into
the hills is full of potholes. They change seats. David is
in the front, Emmi at the back. Suddenly the road begins
to descend. They change again, Emmi sits in the front,
David at the back. They speed down the hill.
STEVE S BUILDING - DAY
Furtwngler, on the stairs, stops, hearing the music echoing
through the building.
Furtwngler left hand begins to tremble, but it is only
his way of sensing the tempo.
Furtwngler slowly continues down the stairs.
STEVE'S VOICE
We handed Wilhelm Furtwngler over
to the civil authorities and he
was charged with serving the Nazi
regime, with uttering anti-Semitic
slurs, performing at an official
Nazi Party function and with being
a Prussian Privy Councillor.
Dr.
Furtwngler was acquitted. I didn't
nail him. But I sure winged him.
And I know I did the right thing.
Furtwngler resumed his career but
he was never allowed to conduct in
the United States. He died in 1954.
Little K succeeded him as head of
the Berlin Philharmonic.
