      EXT. AERIAL SHOT OF THE HAMPTONS - SUNSET11

      We start on the dark, deep swells of the North Atlantic as we 
      hear the voices of a small group singing  Happy Birthday to 
      you, happy birthday--  The song trails off abruptly.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Defense lawyers use the term 
                     duress  to describe the use of 
                    force, coercion, or psychological 
                    pressure exerted on a client in the 
                      commission of a crime.

      And as the camera pushes our way towards the magical, 
      twinkling coastline, we CUT INTO:

      EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT22

      A small Hamptons-ie tent is set up, a casually elegant dining 
      table inside. Emily is sitting at the head of the table in 
      front of a devil s food cake with the words  HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
      DANIEL  written on it, next to half opened gifts. But Emily s 
      not smiling. Rather, her face is filled with anxiety. 

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    When duress is applied to the 
                      emotionally unstable, the result 
                    can be as violent as it is 
                      unpredictable.

      Widen to see VICTORIA, CHARLOTTE, CONRAD, DECLAN, ASHLEY, 
      JACK, AMANDA, and DANIEL sitting frozen. As the shot 
      reverses, we see why: Tyler is pointing a gun at all of them. 
      He stalks the table, training the gun on each of them until 
      he arrives at Conrad. Pauses there a while.

                                  TYLER
                    Clock s ticking, Conrad. You have 
                    three seconds to tell everyone the 
                    truth about what really happened to 
                    David Clarke. 

      Conrad glances to Victoria. What should he do?

                                  TYLER (CONT'D)
                    Do it, or I swear, once again, 
                    someone else is going to die because 
                    you were too weak to own up to your 
                    lies. The question is... who?  REVENGE EP 111   "DURESS"  Blue Production Draft   11/3/11  2.


                                  CONRAD
                    Tyler, put the gun down, this 
                    doesn t involve them--

                                  TYLER
                    Wrong answer. 

      On that, Tyler swings the gun over, aiming directly at Emily.*

                                  TYLER (CONT D)
                    Good bye, Emily.

      ALL SOUND FALLS AWAY as we go TIGHT ON TYLER s FINGER as he 
      squeezes the trigger back on the gun in EXTREME SLOW MOTION , 
      and then, SMASH TO BLACK:

      INT. EMILY S BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY55

      Emily comes downstairs, finds Daniel with coffee, kisses him. 

                                  DANIEL
                    Hey there. I know how you like your 
                    morning coffee.

                                  EMILY
                    You know how I like everything. I 
                    missed you last night. 

                                  DANIEL
                    Me, too. I already sleep better 
                    with you next to me.

                                  EMILY
                    Anything to report on Tyler?

                                  DANIEL
                    He never came home last night. 

                                  EMILY
                    How s your mom holding up?

                                  DANIEL
                    All right, under the circumstances. 
                    She s past the initial shock of the 
                    divorce papers, and now she s 
                      redirecting her energies into 
                    planning my birthday party.  REVENGE EP 111   "DURESS"  Blue Production Draft   11/3/11  3.


                                  EMILY
                    Which is... a problem?

                                  DANIEL
                    For my 21st she hired the cast of 
                    Cirque de Soleil to perform. 
                    Subtlety is not her strong suit when 
                    it comes to parties.

                                  EMILY
                    Then why don t we do something 
                    small here instead? Maybe a 
                    clambake on the beach? 

                                  DANIEL
                    Perfect. I ll call my mom, tell her 
                    it was my idea.

                                  EMILY
                    And I ll make sure she feels included.

      There s a KNOCK at the open door. It s Conrad. Daniel is 
      wary, still furious with him about Tyler.

                                  CONRAD
                    Hello?

                                  DANIEL
                    Dad, what are you doing here?

                                  CONRAD
                    I m on my way to sit down with your 
                    mother and our lawyers; but I was 
                    hoping you and I could talk first.

      Emily senses the tension and grabs her bag, kisses Daniel.

                                  EMILY
                    And I was just on my way out. Call 
                    me later. 
                          (as she goes)
                    Mr. Grayson.

      Conrad gives her a smile as she leaves. A long, tense beat.

                                  DANIEL
                    What do you want me to say, dad?

                                  CONRAD
                    Nothing, I m just asking you to listen.
                          (off Daniel s silence)
                    I have enough people hating me, 
                    son. And I don t want to add you to 
                    the list. You and Charlotte...

                                  CONRAD (CONT'D)
                    you re everything to me. I m not 
                    asking you to take my side against 
                    your mother, or even agree with my 
                    actions. But please, don t cut me 
                    out. Not completely.

                                  DANIEL
                    What about Tyler? Clearly he was 
                    just using me to get to you, but 
                    you hired him with full knowledge-- 

                                  CONRAD
                    And admittedly, it was a mistake; I 
                    wasn t thinking clearly. 
                          (taking a calculated risk)
                    Consider him gone.

                                  DANIEL
                    Then consider me back on board.

      Daniel puts out his hand. Conrad shakes it. As Conrad leaves, 
      Daniel s smile fades. He picks up the phone, dials, then...

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)
                    Hi mom...

      Victoria on the phone with Daniel, finishing getting dressed. *
      She s putting on the diamond earrings from David Clarke.*

                                  VICTORIA
                    Daniel. You left this morning 
                    without saying goodbye. 

                                  DANIEL
                    Thought you could use the rest; I m 
                    sure it was a sleepless night. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Actually it was a comfort knowing 
                    you were in the house. Thank you 
                    for staying.

                                  DANIEL
                    I just spoke to dad. As far as he s 
                      concerned, we ve patched things up. 
                    As far as I m concerned, I m

                    Thank you, Daniel. 

                                  DANIEL
                    Tyler ever come home?

                                  VICTORIA
                    No. But I agree; he s overstayed 
                    his welcome. I ll be asking him to 
                    move out when he returns. 
                    Any more thoughts on how we should 
                    celebrate your birthday? 

                                  DANIEL
                    Yeah, actually; in light of 
                      everything that s going on, I 
                    wanted to keep it simple. So 
                    Emily s throwing a clambake. Just 
                    family and one or two friends.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Whatever makes you happy, darling.

                                  DANIEL
                    You know I m going to have to 
                    invite dad.

                                  VICTORIA
                    It s all for the greater good.  
                    I ll check in with you later. 

      Victoria hangs up as Ashley enters with her arms full of 
      party planning books.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Hello, Mrs. Grayson. Thought I d 
                    spend the morning going over 
                    concepts for Daniel s birthday 
                      celebration. Since we re getting a 
                    bit of a late start, I ve already 
                    narrowed it down to-- 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Clambake.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Yes, as a matter of fact. A young 
                    woman named Amanda Clarke has quite 
                      unexpectedly returned to the 
                    Hamptons after a long absence. 
                    She s the daughter of an old family 
                    friend, and from what Daniel told 
                    me, the current girlfriend of that 
                    boy who runs the Stowaway Tavern. 
                    I d be very interested in catching 
                    up with her while she s in town.

      EXT. NOLAN S HOUSE - POOL - DAY66

      NOLAN is on a chaise with his iPad, watching a tracking 
      system showing a RED DOT FLICKERING on a google-earth 
      satellite map of the SOUTHFORK INN. His waterlogged laptop is 
        disassembled into parts, drying out on a towel nearby. Emily 
      walks up. He ignores her, keeping his eyes on the screen.

                    I Googled  friendship  on the 
                      interwebs. Apparently when you have 
                    a fight with a friend you re 
                    supposed to apologize.

                                  NOLAN
                    Word of advice? Leave the joke

                    And the apologizing? How m I doing 
                    there?

                                  NOLAN
                    I m no expert, but I think 
                    apologies are supposed to include 
                    the words  I m sorry. 

      Nolan s not entirely impressed. She sits next to him.

                    What happened with you and Tyler 
                    took me off guard. But I believe 
                    you never set out to sabotage me. 

                                  NOLAN
                    On the contrary. All I ever set out 
                    to do was help you. And your dad. 
                          (beat, then)
                    As much as I hate to admit it, you 
                    were right about Tyler; I m a 
                    terrible judge of character. 

                                  EMILY
                    We all have weaknesses, Tyler s 
                    just very good at exploiting them. 

                                  NOLAN
                    And now he has all the ammo he 
                    needs. He stole my whale cam.

                    Including everything that happened 
                    at Lydia s. Now he has the physical 
                    evidence he needs to extort Conrad.

                    Rather than wasting more time, let 
                    me make this simple: my client is 
                    willing to forfeit her rights to 
                    every piece of property except 
                    Grayson Manor...

                    She knows damn well this place is 
                    worth all the other homes combined.

                                  RYAN
                    As for the art, all she s asking 
                    for is the Renoir, the Pollock and 
                    the Henry Moores.

                    What about the DeKooning I bought

                    Against my advice, Ms. Grayson is 
                    being more than fair here. In 
                    addition to her share of the 
                    finances, she s simply asking for 
                    one house, a few pieces of art, 
                    and, of course, Charlotte.

                                    BARBARA
                    Mr. Grayson s seeking sole custody.

                                  VICTORIA

                    Charlotte came to live with me of 
                    her own volition. I m just trying 
                    to honor that choice.

                                  VICTORIA
                    The only thing you ve ever honored 
                    is your own ego. You ve been on a 
                    campaign to alienate her from me 
                    for years. 

                                  CONRAD
                    Charlotte needed no provocation.
                          (to Ryan and Barbara)
                    She and Victoria have never gotten 
                    along. Victoria was even caught on 
                    tape recently saying she wished 
                    Charlotte had never been born.

                                  VICTORIA

                    You re reprehensible. 

      Ryan subtly places his hand on Victoria s wrist. Stay cool.

                                    BARBARA
                    I concur. I took the liberty of 
                    glancing through the pre-nup 
                    Victoria signed back in  86. We ll 
                    be using that as the basis for any 
                    financial discussions going forward.

                    Actually, Barbara, we won t. Victoria 
                    was pregnant when she signed the pre-
                    nup. Which by any court s definition 
                    would qualify as  duress.

                                  CONRAD
                    What exactly does that mean?

                    It means, Mr. Grayson, that Mrs.

                    No, it s fine. We were just getting 
                    ready to uh... open the bar. What s

                    more thought to the terms of our

                    more basis to those accusations now 
                    than there was 15 years ago.

      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - LIVING ROOM - DAY1212

      Victoria with Ryan, debriefing after their meeting.

                                  RYAN
                    It s obvious after this initial 
                    meeting that Conrad has no intention 
                    of simply handing over what we re 
                    asking for. You should be prepared 
                    for this to proceed to trial. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    No, we ll handle the matter privately. 
                    Neither one of us has any interest in 
                    airing our laundry in public. 

                                  RYAN
                    Then you may want to consider what 
                    you re willing to give up to avoid 
                    that eventuality. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    I ve given up far too much already. 

                                  RYAN
                    I m afraid you can t have it both 
                    ways. If talks break down in 
                      mediation, our best chance of 
                    defeating Conrad will be to expose 
                    his infidelities in open court. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    A point you ve made abundantly clear.
                    There are other considerations.

                                  RYAN
                    What, Charlotte and Daniel?

                    That s exactly what opposing

                    your self interest. You re playing 
                    right into their hands.

                    I m quite good at what I do, 
                    Victoria, but I can t do anything  
                    unless you start trusting me. You 
                    said you were willing to get your 
                    hands dirty, that time is fast 
                      approaching.

                                  VICTORIA
                    My hands already are dirty. That 
                    pre-nup I signed before we were 
                    married. I lied, I wasn t really 
                    pregnant when I signed it. The 
                    contract is valid.

                                  EMILY
                    Anything?

                                  NOLAN
                    Hiding in plain sight, Dora. I m 
                    guessing back pack or duffel bag on 
                    the floor in the North West corner. 

      Emily looks toward the whale cam. Appears in the corner of 
      Nolan s screen.

                                  NOLAN (CONT D)
                    I see you. Turn 10 degrees to your 
                    right and walk forward. 

      Emily arrives at the duffel bag. Finds the figurine inside 
      the duffel. Puts Shamu in her purse.

                                  EMILY
                    Got it. Thanks.

      She hangs up and Nolan s computer screen goes black as she *
      puts Shamu in her purse. Something else in the duffel catches 
      Emily s eye. An EMPTY PILL BOTTLE. She reads: CLOZAPINE: ANTI-
      PSYCHOTIC. Dr. M. Kutsch, MD. SAN FRANCISCO, CA and a phone *
      number. Off Emily --

      Emily has the pill bottle in one hand, her cell in the other.  *
      She rifles through Tyler s things while she talks.*

                          (beat, neverous)
                    I m sorry, would you mind holding a 
                    minute? I m going to connect you 
                    with the detective in charge of Dr. 
                    Kutch s case. They ve been searching 
                    for Tyler Barrol for weeks.

                                  EMILY
                    Of course, I ll hold.

      But when Emily looks through the window, she sees Tyler 
      walking up the patio towards the house. Emily quickly hangs 
      her phone up and slides out the back door, with the whale cam 
      and pill bottle in hand, just as Tyler enters. He makes an 
      immediate bee line for the duffel bag. Searches and finds 
      nothing. Dumps the contents on the floor, drops to his hands 
      and knees and pores over the mess, which includes the FRAMED 
      NEWSPAPER CLIP FROM THE TIMES IN 107. And as Tyler realizes 
      that the whale cam and his pill bottle are missing, we cut to 
      another POV FROM OUTSIDE THE BACK WINDOW, where Emily peers 
      through, watching Tyler losing it. Tyler topples the coffee 
      table over, then picks up the framed photo of Daniel and 
      Emily off the ground. Stands, studies it a moment, then HURLS 
      it at the mirror behind the bar. The mirror cracks on impact. 
      And OFF Tyler, staring at his reflection, his personality 
      literally fracturing in front of us...

                    What you yipping about, Declan?

                                  DECLAN
                    I was just telling Amanda they 
                    don t make  em any easier going 
                    than you;  cept of course when it 
                    comes to me.

                                  JACK
                    If you re talking about my being 
                    against you and Charlotte getting 
                    an apartment, that s not changing.

                                  DECLAN
                    Not gonna have to. Took your 
                    advice. Apartment s not happening.

                                  JACK
                    I knew you had a brain in there 
                      somewhere. 

      As Declan heads off, Jack notices Amanda s mood shift.

                                  AMANDA
                    So you never told me how you and 
                    Emily came to be friends.

                                  JACK
                    Sam practically tackled her in the 
                    park earlier this summer. Then he 
                    somehow managed to show up at her 
                    door a couple of times. 

                                  AMANDA

                    You two ever go out? 

                                  JACK
                    If you count having dinner with her 
                    by accident, then yeah, exactly 
                    once.

                    Should I be?

                    It s... what did you call it? *
                      Insurance? 
                          (off Nolan, scared)*
                    Where s the camera, Nolan?*

      Nolan swallows hard, his eyes on the knife. 

                                  NOLAN
                    Put that thing down, and we can *
                    talk about this like reasonable

                                  NOLAN
                    Okay! Okay! You re right. I do err 
                    on the J. Edgar side of things, and 
                    I usually back stuff up. But those 
                    files are different-- and I swear, *
                    I don t have the camera.*

      Quick as a flash, Tyler swipes the knife at Nolan, cutting his *
      arm through his shirt. It immediately starts to bleed. Tyler *
      shoves Nolan into a chair. As he removes the loosely pulled *
      tie from around his neck, Nolan stares up at Tyler, his eyes *
      wide with shock and pain. Tyler hears Emily s faint voice. *

                    That was Nolan. Tyler s on a plane *
                    to San Francisco*

      Tyler moves to the desk, where Nolan s laptop displays a live *
      WHALECAM FEED from Emily s house. He turns up the volume and *
      watches the screen where...*

      Victoria. The children s backs are visible in the distance. 

                                  DAVID CLARKE
                    I spoke to Conrad at the office 
                    today, he seemed extra tense. Have 
                    you told him?

                    Tonight. But I m quite sure he 
                    suspects it s coming. I sent Daniel 
                    to my mother s for the evening so I 
                    can finish this.

                    Yes. Finally. 

      He takes her hand and gives it a squeeze, afraid to do more.

                                  DAVID CLARKE

                    It s all set. He ll be home 
                    tonight. Nine o clock.

      Victoria s voice is full of steely resolve, but as she

      Jack, her eyes reveal her true torment at what she s just set 
      in motion.

                      concerned; so far she s just a pretty

      Tyler scans the mantle, where the whale cam should be. But 
      it s not there. He starts searching the house frantically. 
      Emily s cell rings, it s sitting on the kitchen counter: 
      Nolan. Tyler picks up the phone.

      As the girls bond, CONRAD pulls Declan aside.

                    Charlotte told me about her mother s

                    No, it s not. You re a decent young 
                    man and deserve our respect. Victoria 
                    has certain blind spots. But don t 
                    judge the rest of us on her failings.

      Conrad places his hand paternally on his shoulder.

                    You re very important to Charlotte, 
                    which makes you important to me. If 
                    you ever need anything, all you 
                    have to do is ask.

      INT. EMILY S BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT4848

      Tyler is still searching for the whale cam. As he crosses the 
      room, he steps on the floorboard above the Infinity Box. It 
      SQUEAKS. He stops, curious. Drops to pull back the rug as --

      EMILY enters, not seeing him. She lights the candles, then as 
      she picks up the cake, she turns. He s right in front of her.

                    Whale camera? I have no idea what 
                    you re talking about.

      Amanda pulls Victoria aside, her curiosity piqued.

                                  AMANDA
                    What did Tyler mean when he said, 
                     the truth about David Clarke? 

                                  VICTORIA
                    That was just the ravings of a 
                    lunatic, dear. Take it all with a

                                  VICTORIA
                    Ashley will set it up.

      Victoria smiles, her plan in motion. REVEAL Emily standing *
      just to the side, having overheard everything...*

      EXT. BEACH - NIGHT52A52A*

      POLICE HEADLIGHTS swirl through the room. Police officers *
      have cuffed Tyler. Conrad is holding Charlotte as she sobs, *
      Victoria beside them.*

                                  VICTORIA*
                    You re all right now, sweetheart. *
                      Everything s going to be okay. *

      But Charlotte just looks up at Conrad.*

                                  CHARLOTTE*
                    Take me home, Daddy?*

                                    CONRAD*
                    Of course.*

      Conrad leads Charlotte out as Victoria watches, an outsider *
      in her family yet again. Victoria looks for Daniel, sees -- *

      EMILY is in Daniel s arms.*

                                    DANIEL*
                    For a minute there, I thought I was *
                    gonna lose you.*

                                  EMILY*
                    Me, too. If you hadn t saved me...*

      He holds her tightly. A Police Officer frisks Tyler. He takes *
      a wallet out of Tyler s blazer pocket and opens it.*

                                  POLICE OFFICER*
                    What are you doing with Frank *
                    Stevens s wallet?*

                                  TYLER*
                    Someone planted that on me!*

      As the POLICE lead Tyler past Daniel and Emily, Tyler cocks *
      his hand like a gun and pretends to shoot them, his eyes *
      wild. The Police drag him out the door. Victoria sweeps over.*

                                  VICTORIA*
                    Emily, dear, what a horror. Are you *
                    all right?*  REVENGE EP 111   "DURESS"  Blue Production Draft   11/3/11  49.


                                  EMILY*
                    I m still shaking. I had no idea *
                    Tyler was so deranged.*

                                    DANIEL*
                    Tyler had Frank s wallet, mom... do *
                    you think he s the one who killed *
                    him?*

      Off Victoria, stunned. Emily catches eyes with Nolan. He *
      raises his glass to Emily, overhearing. Nicely done. *

      INT. EMILY S BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS5353

      Emily is standing by the open window, having heard Amanda and 
      Victoria s conversation. Nolan walks up.

                                  NOLAN
                    Emily Thorne, displaying emotion 
                    and withholding your inner ninja 
                    while at gunpoint. You almost 
                    seemed like a mere mortal tonight.

                                  EMILY
                    There s a first -- and last -- time 
                    for everything.
                          (lowering her voice)
                    It wasn t loaded. The gun. I took 
                    the bullets out before the party.

                                  NOLAN
                          (whistling)
                    You never cease to amaze-- and 
                    slightly terrify-- me.*
                          (then)*
                    Small world, Frank s wallet showing *
                    up in Tyler s jacket. You had this *
                    all planned, didn t you, maestro?*

                                  EMILY*
                    Did I?*

      Ashley walks up, still rattled.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Talk about the party from hell.
                          (noticing Nolan s blood)
                    What happened to you?

                                  NOLAN
                    Tyler used me for carving practice.

      He moves off, Ashley following.

      Daniel and Emily are getting into bed.

                                  DANIEL
                    If anything had happened to you or 
                      Charlotte...

                                  EMILY
                    But it didn t. We re both okay.

                                  DANIEL
                    Still. I don t know what I did to 
                    deserve you, Emily Thorne, but I 
                    can t imagine my life without you.

                                  EMILY
                    Lucky for you, you don t have to.

      And then she is in his arms.

                    I shudder to think what you charge
