      INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - COURTROOM #18 - DAY11

      Daniel Golden.  He stares straight at us, intones:

                                  GOLDEN
                    This is not about sex.  Let me 
                    repeat that because it bares 
                    repeating.  Thisis notabout sex.

      Golden s opening statement.  PETER at the defense table.  
      Judge HARVEY WINTER presiding.  Golden points toward A.S.A. 
      LANDRY at the prosecution table. 

                                  GOLDEN (CONT D)
                    Now my opponent, your honor, would 
                    have you believe this case is 
                    positively drenched in sex.  And if 
                    we were asking for a new trial 
                    based on whether my client was a 
                    good husband, he might be right.   

      Peter glances toward the gallery.  No Alicia.  Wait, someone 
      enters the court, and he sees her out in the hall on her 
      cell.  Peter pauses over that as...

                                  GOLDEN (CONT D)
                    So what is this really about?  My 
                    client was convicted and sent to 
                    prison for a very simple, almost 
                    prosaic, reason.  He told his 
                    subordinates to  D.P. -- that is 
                     Decline to Prosecute -- certain 
                    cases, and the prosecution believes 
                    this was in trade for financial and 
                    sexual favors.  Yes, that s it.  
                    After all the sexual sturm and drang 
                    of the last eight months, that s 
                    what it all comes down to.     

      Peter notices an intent CHILDS in the gallery, watching.  The 
    two men make eye contact.  No love lost.  

                                  GOLDEN (CONT D)
                    But the prosecution has a problem, 
                    your honor.  The evidence they 
                    presented at trial was entirely 
                    circumstantial.  And to be granted a 
                    new trial, we don t even need to 
                    disprove any of it.    
                                  (MORE)



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    2.

      CONTINUED:11
                                  GOLDEN (CONT D)
                    What we need to do-- what we intend 
                    to do-- is to persuade your honor 
                    that if the jury had heard the new 
                    evidence you will hear over the next 
                    two weeks, they likely would have 
                    reached a different verdict.

      INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY22

      Alicia out on her cell, talking with Will...

                                  ALICIA
                    No, I m alright.  I m just staying 
                    for the opening arguments.

      INTERCUT with...

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - DAY33

      ...Will on his phone gesturing toward an assistant showing 
    him two or three possible court exhibits:

                                  WILL
                    How s it going?

                                  ALICIA
                    Good.  They feel good.  

                                  WILL
                    Good, the judge likes Peter.  He 
                    just needs to be given a reason to 
                    decide for him.    

      Alicia nods, uncomfortable at the strategizing.  She peers 
      through the gap in the door: Golden still talking.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Anyway-- sorry to be loading up on 
                    you-- but the client should be here 
                    in an hour.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Which client?

                                  WILL
                    Colin Sweeney.

      Alicia pauses, raises an eyebrow.  Will grins...

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    3.

      CONTINUED:33


                                  WILL
                    I love the reaction that name gets.  
                    It s like the horses in  Young 
                      Frankenstein.  

                                  ALICIA
                    So we re really going to represent him?

                                  WILL
                    We re really going to represent 
                    him.  And, lucky you, you re now 
                    second chair.

                                  ALICIA
                    Lucky me.

      Will looks up, sees Diane at his door.  To Alicia...

                                  WILL
                    See you in an hour.

    He hangs up, turns to Diane, as--

                                  DIANE
                    Clients are going to bolt.  

                                  WILL
                    Your clients.  Bleeding-heart 
                    feminists who don t pay the bills. 

                                  DIANE
                    Don t play that game.  This isn t a 
                    feminist issue.  Colin Sweeney 
                    killed his wife.

                                  WILL
                    Colin Sweeney was found not guilty 
                    of killing his wife.

                                  DIANE
                    So was O.J.

                                  WILL
                    Yes, and--  Why am I the one 
                    standing up for innocent-until-
                      proven-guilty here?

                                  DIANE
                    Because you re not.  You want his 
                    company s business.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    4.

      CONTINUED: (2)33


                                  WILL
                    As should you.  We ve lost a third of 
                    our business with Stern leaving the 
                    firm.  We can t be turning up our 
                    noses at any clients these days.

      They both look toward the hall, see Kalinda there with two 
      stainless steel suitcases, nodding to Diane.  Ready.  

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Because we re certainly not making 
                    money from your pet causes.

                                  DIANE
                    It s not a pet cause.  It s not 
                    even a lawsuit yet.  I m 
                      considering it.   

                                  WILL
                    Come on.  You can t win.  You don t 
                    even want to win.  You just want to 
                    harass gun manufacturers.     

      Diane goes to the door, pauses there...

                                  DIANE
                    So it s the wild west, is it?  You 
                    have one vote, and I have one vote, 
                    so we do what we want?

                                  WILL
                    Looks like it.

                                  DIANE
                    We re heading into a bad time.

                                  WILL
                    Yep.  Seems inevitable.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY44

      Fwop-fwop.  The second sectioned suitcase is opened by 
      Kalinda, revealing a bevy of guns.  More guns already laid 
    out from the first suitcase.  Street guns.  All types.  All 
      erotically shiny.

                                  KALINDA
                    Revolvers, semi-automatics. 6-shot. 
                    8-shot.  

      Diane stares at them.  An arsenal.  Five or six associates 
      around her.  Cary and Julius Cain among them.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    5.

      CONTINUED:44


                                  CARY
                    Wow.  

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    To win, we ve got to show that the 
                    gun manufacturers violated state 
                    law by knowingly allowing guns to 
                    be distributed illegally-- 

                                  KALINDA
                    Every single one was purchased 
                    within two miles of here.  

      Diane shakes her head, ogles the collection of firearms--

                                  DIANE
                    They re all unloaded?

                                  KALINDA
                          (nods, showing how)
                    Drop the magazine.  Slide the bolt 
                    to check for a chambered round.  Do 
                    a physical check of the barrel.  
                    You re unloaded.

      Kalinda offers the gun to Diane.  She takes it gingerly.  
      Clearly uncomfortable, but intrigued. 

                                  DIANE
                    It s very odd.  The attraction of 
                    handguns, isn t it?  Almost primal.

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    It s a good look.  Sarah Palin-
                    esque.

                                  DIANE
                    Thank you.

      Kalinda doesn t respond: her usual reaction to liberal 
      novices.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    And what is this?  

                                  KALINDA
                    Kel-Tec 32.  7 shot.  9 mm.

                                  DIANE
                    It s very small.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    6.

                                  KALINDA
                          (offers a smaller one)
                    Smith & Wesson.  J Frame  Lady Smith.   

                                  DIANE
                    And how much would this cost on the 
                    street?

                                  KALINDA
                    Depends.  That was fifty.  

      Diane nods, aims, sees the associates suddenly gathered at 
    the conference room window.  Gossiping:

                                  CARY
                    I heard it was a necrophilia thing.  

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    No, he chopped her up: put her in 
                    the dog food.

      Diane sees passing in the hall with Will... COLIN SWEENEY.  
      40 s, handsome in a dissolute, Dorian Grey kind of way-- a 
    bit of the dandy in an elegant Savile Row suit.  Claus Von 
      B low without the accent.

                    Tough to convict when they never 
                    found a body.  The perfect crime.

    And they watch as Will leads Colin Sweeney into his office.  
      A second later, Alicia follows.

                    Why s Alicia on it?

      Kalinda looks up-- news to her.  She watches Alicia.

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    You know why.  Her husband 
                    prosecuted him the first time.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - DAY55

      A handshake.  Gentle.  Regal.  Sweeney shakes Alicia s 
      hand...

                                  SWEENEY
                    Mrs. Florrick. A pleasure to meet you.  

      Alicia offers a polite smile, then pulls her hand away.

                                  SWEENEY (CONT D)
                    Don t worry, I killed her with my 
                    other hand.

      Will and Alicia trade a look until Sweeney smiles:

                                  SWEENEY (CONT D)
                    Joking.  Sorry, I ve developed a 
                    perverse sense of the comic over 
                    the last year.

                                  WILL
                    Well, let s not try to joke like 
                    that in court, shall we?

                                  SWEENEY
                    Do you think it will get to that: court? 

                                  WILL
                    Cantwell is a top litigator; he 
                    wants a trial.  Our goal is just to 
                    avoid a jury.  You re in a similar 
                    situation to OJ, if you don t mind 
                    me continuing the metaphor?

                                  SWEENEY
                    Mind?  I embrace it.

    He smiles at Alicia who doesn t smile back.

                                  WILL
                    Like OJ, you were found not guilty, 
                    but people think you did it.  They 
                    want to see you hurt.  Your 
                    stepdaughter is counting on that-- 
                    that s why she s suing you in civil 
                    court--

                                  SWEENEY
                    Charlotte and I... never saw eye to 
                    eye, I m afraid.  She resented 
                    Carolyn leaving her father for me.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    8.

      CONTINUED:55


      Alicia takes notes, listening, trying not to look at Colin 
    who constantly shoots looks toward her, taking pleasure in 
    his ability to unnerve.

                                  WILL
                    Well, unfortunately, the Illinois 
                     Slayer Statute  says you can t 
                    inherit someone s estate if you 
                    cause their death, so if Charlotte 
                    wins, she gets the money, the 
                    company--

                                  SWEENEY
                    What do you think, Mrs. Florrick?

                                  ALICIA
                    What do I think of what?

                                  SWEENEY
                    Your husband prosecuted me.  You 
                    must have an opinion of my guilt or 
                    innocence.

                                  ALICIA
                    My opinion is irrelevant.

                                  SWEENEY
                    Not to me.  Not at this moment.  
                    You think I killed my wife?

                                  ALICIA
                    Of course.    

      Sweeney smiles at the honesty as Will shifts slightly...

                                  WILL
                    You pay us to represent your interests-- 

                                  SWEENEY
                          (only eyes for Alicia)
                    Even though her body was never 
                    found?

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sure you found a way to dispose 
                    of it.

                                  SWEENEY
                    Chopped her up and buried her in a 
                    landfill somewhere?

                                  ALICIA
                    That you were driving from St. 
                    Louis to Chicago at the time?  

                                  SWEENEY
                    So you have no problem representing 
                      a murderer?

                                  ALICIA
                    I have a great problem with it.

                                  SWEENEY
                    But you ll do it anyway?

                                  ALICIA
                    Unless you would like to exclude me.  

                                  SWEENEY
                    Not for the world.  

      Will looks between them.  Nods.

                                  WILL
                    Okay, great. Now that that s settled... 

      INT.  PROBATE COURTROOM - DAY66

      A small court.  Barely two rows in the gallery.  Packed.  60 
      spectators, reporters in a room built for 40.  Entering is 
      JUDGE TIMOTHY STANEK.  25 years on the bench, all of it in 
      probate.  Meticulous, strong-willed, married to his ways.  He 
      pauses at the door, turns it back and forth.  It squeaks.

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Cory, let s get some WD-40 on this.

    The Bailiff nods as Stanek heads toward the bench:

                                  JUDGE STANEK (CONT D)
                    Quiet down.  Give me that.  You.  
                    Now.

      A reporter in the front row with an iPhone, typing.

                                  JUDGE STANEK (CONT D)
                    Don t try to hide it.  Now.

    The reporter frowns, walks up with his iPhone.  Stanek 
      reaches out with a trash bin.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    10.

      CONTINUED:66

    The reporter reluctantly drops it in, as Will at the defense 
      table with Sweeney and Alicia smiles to himself: he actually 
      likes Stanek.

                                  JUDGE STANEK (CONT D)
                    Okay, now I know you all are 
                    excited about this trial, but this 
                    is a probate matter and, as such...

      A cell rings in the back row.  Stanek shoots a look toward 
    it, and a dozen spectators quickly reach toward their belts.

                                  JUDGE STANEK (CONT D)
                    ...and, as such, you re just visiting 
                    here.  I live here.  And my rules go.  
                    Mr. Gardner, are you ready? 

                                  WILL
                    Yes, your honor.

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Mr. Cantwell--  

    He looks toward the empty plaintiff s table...

                                  JUDGE STANEK (CONT D)
                    Where the hell is Cantwell?

    He looks toward the court when a whispering fit starts in the 
      second row.  Finally a young woman stands.  NANCY CROZIER.  
      ( Kro-sher. )  Mid-20s.  Just out of law school.  Sexy.  
      Awkward.  Nervous as hell.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Your honor, I um...  

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Who are you?

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    I um-- Nancy Crozier... Your honor.  
                    Mr. Cantwell has taken sick, and the 
                    plaintiff... She asked me to step 
                    in.

      Will just stares at her, incredulously, starts to smile.  A 
      slam fuckin  dunk.  Alicia eyes the girl sympathetically.  
      She s shaking nervously.  Incredulous...

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Miss Armitage?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    11.

      CONTINUED: (2)66


      CHARLOTTE ARMITAGE (mid-20s) stands in court next to Nancy.  
      A little overweight.  Plain.  Taken to sweater vests.  Could 
    be a small town travel agent. 

                                  JUDGE STANEK (CONT D)
                    You can request a continuance if 
                    you would like to look for other 
                    representation.  As you can see, 
                    the defense has spared no expense 
                    in waging its defense.  

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Yes, your honor, I know.  Nancy and 
                    I go way back, and I think I d 
                    rather go with someone I trust.  

      Alicia eyes her through all this.  Something likable and 
      respectable about that.

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Ma am, you re not old enough to go 
                    way back, but if Miss... what is it?

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Crozier.

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    ...Crozier is your choice, come on 
                    up here, Miss Crozier.  That s 
                    where you sit.  

      Nancy starts forward, then-- oops-- rushes back to grab her 
      files, as Will whispers to Alicia...

                                  WILL
                    Slip in a motion for a bench trial 
                    before she knows what hit her.  

      Alicia nods, stands...

                                  ALICIA
                    Your honor, just a quick request 
                    before we begin.  We respect your 
                    judgement in this matter, and ask 
                    that this be a bench trial.

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Miss Crozier?

    But Nancy is busy unloading her files on her table.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    12.

                    I m sorry, what was the question, 
                    your honor?

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    They want this to be a bench trial.  
                    They want not to have a jury.  Do 
                    you have an argument?

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Ummm...

      Nancy looks over toward Alicia who purposefully looks blase.  

                                  NANCY CROZIER (CONT D)
                    I don t know.

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Well, if you don t know, then I 
                    must decide against you.

      Alicia frowns slightly at  decide against you -- the judge 
      hinting.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    The only thing I want to say, your 
                    honor, is I think it s...
                          (finding the word)
                    ...fairer if we have a cross-section 
                    of people, not just one.  Please 
                    don t take that the wrong way.

      Stanek smiles to himself at the sweetness.

                                  ALICIA
                    Your honor, I think it s  fairer  
                    if we decide this matter on the law 
                    and not on the passions of a jury.

      Nancy raises her hand.  Stanek smiles, starting to like her.

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Miss Crozier?

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    That might be true, but I m not 
                    going to try to... rile up those 
                    passions, you know?  I just want 
                    them to hear the truth.  

      Alicia shoots a look over toward an innocent Nancy.  Is it an

      Nancy smiles, claps her hands.

                    You re welcome.

      Alicia looks between them.  Oh fuck.  Stanek brings down his 
      gavel.  And Alicia sits next to Will...

                                        ACT ONE

      INT. COURTHOUSE - JURY ROOM - DAY77

      Matan Brody.  He sits staring straight ahead.  Hostile.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Thank you for giving us a few 
                    minutes, Mr. Brody.

                                  MATAN
                    What do you want?

      Peter and Golden sit across from him.  In the jury holding 
      room.  Peter s home away from home.

                                  PETER
                    We re going to subpoena you to 
                    testify.  

                                  MATAN
                    You understand I ll be a hostile *
                    witness?  

                                  PETER
                    We understand you weren t always *
                    that hostile.

                                  MATAN
                    That was before you were corrupt.

      Peter stares at him, as Golden tries to break the ice:

                                  GOLDEN
                    I think what we re saying, Mr. 
                    Brody, is we re not the enemy here.  
                    Peter hired you at the State s 
                    Attorney s Office.  He promoted you-- 
                    four times.  Glenn Childs has 
                    promoted you once, and he ll never 
                    let you rise higher because he 
                    thinks you ve still got one leg in 
                    Peter s camp.

      Matan turns to Golden...

                                  MATAN
                    Ah, so that s what this is about?  
                      Influencing my testimony.   

                                  PETER
                    No, we re trying to get you to tell 
                    the truth-- even if it hurts Childs. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    15.

      Matan stands, disgusted.

                                  MATAN
                    I ve always told the truth.    

                                  PETER
                    I know a lot of people who always told *
                    the truth, and yet here I sit.  Are *
                    you really fulfilled chasing my wife 
                    from court to court?  I respected you.  
                    Childs turned you into an errand boy. 

      Golden winces slightly at  boy. 

                                  MATAN
                    Mr. Florrick, you hired me.  I m 
                    grateful for that.  You ran a tough 
                      department.  I admired that.  But the 
                    day you started slipping your wife 
                      information to use in court-- that s 
                    the day I lost respect for you.    

      Matan starts toward the door when the Bailiff opens it, letting 
      in... Glenn Childs.  Matan stops in his tracks, frowns: fuck.

                                  CHILDS
                    Seems like a busy room.

                                  MATAN
                    They asked me here.

                                  CHILDS
                    Yes.  They asked me here too.  

      Matan shoots an angry look back toward Peter.

                                  CHILDS (CONT D)
                    They must vewanted us to bump into 
                    each other.

                                  PETER
                    A quirk of scheduling.  I only have 
                    a minimal number of visiting hours.

                                  MATAN
                    I told them to go to hell.  

                                  CHILDS
                    I have no doubt.  

      Matan pauses-- wants to say more-- then starts out the door, 
      frowning.  Of course Childs has doubts.  After he s gone:


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    16.

                                  CHILDS (CONT D)
                    So that s why I m here?  To see 
                    Matan leaving? 

                                  PETER
                    No, we just needed a third for pinochle.  *

                                  CHILDS
                    Next time, just phone me with your 
                    strategic plan, so I don t have to 
                    actually leave my office.

    And Childs leaves.  Peter and Golden trade a look...

                                  GOLDEN
                    What do you think?

                                  PETER
                    I think we ll find out when Matan

      INT.  SWEENEY S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY1010

      Will and Alicia wait in a palatial apartment with magnificent 
      skyline view.  Louis XIV chairs, African fetish dolls, 
      disturbing manga blow-ups.  The Marquis De Sade sbachelor pad.  

                                  WILL
                    You think he d sell them after his 
                    wife s death.  

      They stare up at a massive manga print of a dying Japanese 
      woman, a knife in her gut. 

                                  ALICIA
                    My guess is he didn t start buying 
                    them until then.    

      Will smiles, looks at her...

                                  WILL
                    So are they talking electronic 
                      monitoring?

      Alicia looks at him, confused.  Oh, jumping subjects:

                    With Peter? Yes. If he wins the appeal.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.  But... nervous.

                                  WILL

                                  ALICIA
                    Same.

                    We said we d have dinner, didn t we?

                    Yes.  We should.  

                                  SWEENEY
                    Should what?

      They look up at Sweeney entering the room.  Things serious 
      again.

                                  WILL
                    Nothing.  Talking.

                                  SWEENEY
                    So sorry to keep you waiting but I

                    Now as I understand it-- you re 
                    going to try to make me likable.

                                  WILL
                    Well, in a civil case we can t keep 
                    you off the stand.  You have to 
                    testify--

                                  SWEENEY
                    Yes, before a jury.  That was... 
                      unexpected.

                                  WILL
                    Unexpected things happen in 
                      courtrooms, Mr. Sweeney.  That s why 
                    we try and avoid them if we can.

                                  SWEENEY
                    And now you re worried I ll say 
                    something unfortunate on the stand: 
                    like what I did with her remains?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Take this seriously, Mr. Sweeney.  
                    If you value your money take this 
                    seriously.

      Will looks toward Alicia; she s found a workable scolding 
      vibe with Sweeney.  Sweeney smiles:

                                  SWEENEY
                    Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.  Of

                    A civil case can get ugly.  They

                    But we were devoted to each other.  
                      Classically S&M.

                                  ALICIA
                    That s her, isn t it?

      A large photograph.  A beautiful woman.  In her forties.

                                  SWEENEY
                    Yes.  She hated that photo.  So I 
                    got it enlarged.

                                  ALICIA
                    They re going to put on evidence 
                    that you were unfaithful to her 
                    with multiple women.  Is this true?

                                  SWEENEY
                    Well, I had sex with other women.  
                    Carolyn didn t do tricks.  And she 
                    knew I needed them.  So... she was 
                    okay with me going elsewhere.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sorry... tricks?

                                  SWEENEY
                    Leather, handcuffs, cross-dressing--
                    Does that make me more or less 
                    likable?  Sorry, I ve lost track of 
                    the zeitgeist these days.  

                                  ALICIA
                    But you still claim you were in

                                  SWEENEY
                    Yes.  Madly.

      Alicia takes this in for a second.  Then she pulls out a 
      thick document-- accountant s ledgers, lots of numbers--

                    Her accountant testified at the 
                    murder trial that she demanded to 
                    see the books that day.  Whatever

    She shows Sweeney the document--

                    And one thing she saw was this.  
                    Withdrawals, by you, of hundreds of 
                    thousands of dollars--

                                  SWEENEY
                    I told you-- Carolyn didn t 
                    begrudge me my appetites.

                                  ALICIA
                    There were rumors she wanted to 
                    oust you from the family business--

                                  SWEENEY
                    Yes, and there are rumors you knew 
                    about your husband s whores.

                                  ALICIA
                    Probably not the best answer in 
                    court.  

      Sweeney smiles.  Likes her strength.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Is it true that when they told you 
                    of your wife s death, you said  Oh 
                    no, now I ll need a fourth for 
                    Bridge.  

                                  SWEENEY
                    Yes, and when Paul McCartney was 
                    told of John Lennon s death he said 
                     What a drag.   I m not going to 
                    make a very good witness, am I?

                                  ALICIA
                    No, you re not.  

                                  SWEENEY
                    I didn t do it.

      Alicia looks at Sweeney.  The most genuine he s ever been. 
      Almost pleading, sympathetic.  After a second, he smiles:

                                  SWEENEY (CONT D)
                    How d that sound?

      Alicia frowns.  Just a scam.

      INT. GUN SHOP - DAY1414

      Ka-lick-- the bolt of a .22 caliber is yanked back by a gun 
      shop proprietor, JULIE, a 29-year-old feminist: leather 
      skirt, bright lipstick, no-nonsense.  She hands it to Diane.  
    Her shop a Candyland of guns. 

                                  JULIE
                      Volquartsen 3.5 compact.  10-shot 
                    mag.  Adjustable rear and blade 
                    front.  It ll take down any man in 
                    his tracks.

      Diane takes it, just as fascinated with Julie as the gun, 
      Kalinda standing next to her...

                                  KALINDA
                    What if she doesn t have a FOID?

                                  JULIE
                    Apply for one.  You ll have a gun 
                    in 30 days.

      Julie studies Kalinda...

                    Do youhave a Firearm Owner ID?

      Kalinda takes out her card.  Shows it. 

                                  JULIE (CONT D)
                    Then buy it for her.  

    And that s it-- Julie turns to another customer.

      Diane looks at Kalinda.  Clearly she s implying something.

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    I was checking on a court date and I 
                    found out.  You passed on the lawsuit.  
                    So-- what are we doing here?

      Diane pauses.  Uncomfortable.  She looks around.  Lowers her 
      voice:

                                  DIANE
                    Ten years ago, a drug dealer named 
                    Jeffrey Spellman was convicted of a 
                      double-murder in the 24th ward.  At 
                    his sentencing hearing he threatened 
                    to kill his lawyer when he got out.  

                                  KALINDA
                    You were his lawyer?

                          (nods)
                    I also spoke last week at his parole 
                    hearing-- againsthis release. 

                                  KALINDA
                    He saw you speak?

                          (nods)
                    He d made subsequent threats.  

      Kalinda studies her.  This isserious. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Has he been released?

                                  DIANE
                    They decide on Friday. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Okay.  You need a gun.

                                  DIANE
                    No-- I-- The thing is: I don t want
                    to need one.  I ve been at the 
                    forefront of gun control my entire 
                    life.  My father wrote the first

                    No, this was a mistake.

                    Look, you re my boss, and I ll do 
                    whatever you want.  But you spoke

      INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - COURTROOM #18 - DAY1515

      Matan.  An unhappy Matan.  He s on the stand.  Pausing.  
      Moving the microphone closer to himself.  He stares out at 
    the court.  Mid-questioning.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Well, let me rephrase that, Mr. 
                    Brody.  What task force did Mr. 
                    Florrick ask you to head up?

                                  MATAN
                    It was a task force focusing on 
                    fraudulent real estate deals.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Deals called land flips?

                                  MATAN
                    Yes.

                                  GOLDEN
                    As you understood it, there was an 
                    attempt to buy up land, cheaply, and 
                    through fraudulent means, near the 
                    stadiums that were to be built for 
                    the Olympics?

                                  MATAN
                    Yes, sir.

                                  GOLDEN
                    And during the time you were heading 
                    up this task force-- this task force 
                    created by Mr. Florrick-- you were 
                    approached by Mr. Childs, who was Mr. 
                    Florrick s chief deputy, isn t that 
                    correct?

      Matan trades a quick look with Childs in the gallery.

                                  MATAN
                    Yes, sir.

                                  GOLDEN
                    And he approached you to keep an eye 
                    on Mr. Florrick, is that correct?

      Matan looks from Childs to Peter, considering it.

                                  MATAN
                    Could you define  keep an eye on ?

                                  GOLDEN
                    He suggested that Mr. Florrick might 
                    have a hidden motive for this task 
                    force?

                    I have no idea why you are 
                    objecting to that, Mr. Landry.

                                  LANDRY
                    A leading question, your honor.

                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    I know I might need a score card 
                    here, Mr. Landry, isn t Mr. Matan a

                    Alright.  Overruled.  You may 
                    answer the question.

                                  MATAN
                    Yes.

                    I think you might have to remind us 
                    all what that  yes  means.

                                  MATAN
                    Yes, Mr. Childs suggested that 
                    Peter might have a hidden motive.

                                  GOLDEN
                    And the hidden motive was that 
                    Peter arranged this task force in 
                    order to then  shake down  the real 
                    estate developers for payoffs?

      Matan looks toward a stern Childs.

                                  MATAN
                    My opinion was irrelevant.  I did 
                    what I was asked.

                                  GOLDEN

                    You said you  did what you were

                                  MATAN
                    That was a figure of speech.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Yes, I understand.  But figures of

                    He asked me to keep track of Peter.  
                    He thought he was being bribed to 
                    D.P. cases.

      Matan sees Childs get up and start out of court.  Fuck him, 
      Matan decides. 

                                  GOLDEN
                    And so how are those cases going 
                    now?

                                  MATAN
                    Excuse me.

                                  GOLDEN
                    These cases that Peter asked you to 
                    drop, you must be fervently pursuing 
                    them now that Peter Florrick is no 
                    longer around to obstruct them.

                                  MATAN
                    No, sir.

                                  GOLDEN
                    My goodness, what happened to them?

      Matan pauses, realizes the truth of this.

                                  MATAN
                    We dropped them.

      Judge Winter sits back as Landry frowns to himself: damn.  
      Golden returns to his seat as Peter reaches across, squeezes 
    his arm: good job.

      INT.  PROBATE COURTROOM - DAY - LATER1616

      ...Nancy Crozier stands, now in another court, but it may 
      take us a minute to catch up...

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Thank you, your honor.  Actually, 
                    just to be clear... you are the 
                      defendant s sister-in-law, Mariel?

      MARIEL ARMITAGE on the stand.  40 s.  Heroin chic.

                                  MARIEL
                    Yes, you mean the defendant who 
                    killed my sister?

                                  WILL
                    Your honor, do I really need to 
                    object?

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    We all need to perform our roles 
                    here, Mr. Gardner.  Yes, you need to 
                    object.  And yes I need to sustain.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Sorry, your honor, we won t let 
                    that happen again.  I m sorry, 
                    members of the jury. 

      Alicia rolls her eyes as she watches the jury: perfectly 
      charmed by Nancy, loving her.  

                                  NANCY CROZIER (CONT D)
                    Now I have to ask you a question 
                    I m not proud of: a sexual 
                    question.  Do you mind?

                                  MARIEL
                    No, please.  That s why I m here.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Okay.  You and the defendant, Mr. 
                    Sweeney, had... sex: sexual relations?

                                  MARIEL
                    Yes.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    28.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    He had sex with his wife s sister?

                                  MARIEL
                    That s correct.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Sorry, I think I m blushing.  I m from 
                    Michigan and this is all new to me.

    The jury chuckles with her as Alicia leans toward Will:

                                  ALICIA
                    She s very good.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Miss Armitage-- Mariel-- what could 
                    possibly have led you to sleep with 
                    your own sister s husband?

      Mariel takes a moment, emotional.  

                                  MARIEL
                    I ve struggled with addiction my whole 
                    life.  Drugs, alcohol.  My sister and 
                    I were estranged-- over that.  I 
                    suppose I was... getting back at her.  
                    And Colin was only too happy to help.  
                    He made me do things... thingshe said 
                    his wife wouldn t do.  He--

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Okay, I think that s enough.  Thank 
                    you, I think I ll sit down now.

      Alicia glances over at Charlotte again, who stares straight 
      ahead, somberly.  Then she looks over at Sweeney, sitting 
      between her and Will, as...

                    close now.  

    But Golden s staring at his Blackberry.  Something bad.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    What?

                    I don t think he s such a threat

      Golden hands the Blackberry to Peter.  An internet news 
      article--  Russian Mobster Murdered -- with a photo of 
      Amber s Russian john.  Golden frowns as Peter nods, getting

      INT.  COURTHOUSE - JURY ROOM - NIGHT1818

      Alicia and Peter sit across from each other--

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  I won t be there.

      Peter looks at her, surprised at her certainty.

                                  PETER
                      I understand.  It might be rough.  
                    Madison could say anything.  Although 
                    Golden thinks it might be better if you 
                    were there.  For the judge to see...

      Alicia just looks at him, says nothing.  Peter nods.

                                  PETER (CONT'D)
                    Golden also thinks the Sheriff s 
                    department will come to the house to 
                    set up electronic monitoring in case 
                    I m released.  You alright with that?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, but I wanted to agree on a few 
                    things first.  

                                  PETER
                    Okay.

                                  ALICIA
                    There is a maid s room.  We ve been 
                    using it for storage.  I ll clear it 
                    out, and put a bed in there. 
                          (Peter stares at her)
                    In the meantime, we can both use the 
                    master bath.  Jackie s been helping out 
                    on weekdays while I m at work.  I think 
                    she should continue: picking up the 
                    kids up at school, making dinner. And 
                    we don t have a study.  I have your old 
                    rolltop desk in storage.  I ll put that 
                    in the dining room.  Okay?

      Peter nods.  But he studies her.

                                  PETER
                    Do you love me?

      Alicia smiles, puts her hand on top of his.

                                  PETER
                    You re sounding like a lawyer.

                    Do you wantto be together again?*

      Alicia is calm, clinical, as if talking about somebody else:

                                  ALICIA
                    Peter, I ve been hurt deeply.  I 
                    imagine I ll heal some day, but for the 
                    moment, we need to make a plan.  Okay?

                    We still have your computer, so we 
                    can set that up, but--

      INT. DIANE S MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT1919

      A master bed.  Refined quilt.  Tasteful sheets.  1000 thread 
      count.  A gun is placed on it.  Beretta 950 Jetfire.  Then a 
    box of ammunition.  Then a Barnes & Noble shopping bag.  
      Diane stares down at it all.  We re in...

      ...her bedroom.  Clearly refined taste.  Modern art on the 
      walls.  Diane sits on the bed, carefully touches the gun.  Picks 
    it up.  It s heavy.  A nice heaviness.  Diane moves it from hand 
    to hand.  Just the slightest edge of a smile on her lips.

    She opens the Barnes & Noble bag.  Takes out Philip Roth s 
      latest book.  A Dave Eggers novel.  And a book about guns.  

      Diane opens the box of cartridges.  Looks at the perfectly 
      lined bullets.  Takes out one.  More pointed than she expected.  
    She looks at the gun.  Finds the magazine release.  Out klunks 
    the magazine.  She studies it.  

      Takes one of the bullets and carefully edges it in with a 
      satisfying click.  Hmmm.  She takes the gun and slides the 
      magazine in.  Another good click.

      There it is.  A loaded gun.  Diane raises it, looks down the site 
    at the dark bedroom window.  And smiles.  A different smile.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    32.

      CONTINUED:1919

      A smile of command.  Then her smile grows even wider and changes 
    in character as she realizes: what am I doing?

    She takes the magazine out, removes the bullet.  Places it 
      back in the box.  And reaches for the Philip Roth. 

      INT. PROBATE COURTROOM - DAY2020

      Nancy Crozier standing nervously in front of the witness 
      stand.  Referring to high school note cards.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    As I was saying, Mr. Sweeney... 
                    um... there was blood and skin 
                    found on a rope at your house, 
                    right?

      Colin Sweeney.  On his best behavior.  Calm, shy.  Definitely 
      playacting.

                                  SWEENEY
                    Yes, that s right.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    And this blood-- and skin-- the 
                    police say it all matched your 
                    wife?  Is that right?

                                  SWEENEY
                    Yes.  We like to cut our own 
                    firewood and wrap the kindling in 
                    rope.  And I believe my dearest 
                    Carolyn cut herself.

      Alicia shoots a subtle frown toward Sweeney: don t overdo it.  
    He smiles, nods.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    That seems understandable.  I get 
                    that.  So, I need to ask this 
                    question, Mr. Sweeney, please excuse 
                    me.

    The jury could just reach out and hug Crozier as she turns to 
      another note card.

                                  SWEENEY
                    Go right ahead, dear.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Thank you.  You never strangled 
                    your wife, did you?

                    What is it?  I can t see it.

                    It says that your wife was admitted 
                    to the hospital in April, 1997--

                    Objection, your Honor.  This was excluded 
                    at the previous trial for-- relevance.

                    I ll allow.
                          (Alicia doesn t sit)
                    Your exception is noted, counselor.  
                    Sit down.

      Fuck.  Alicia sits, as she and Will brace themselves.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Your wife seems to have told the 
                    medical staff something extraordinary:  
                    that you tried to strangle her.

                                  SWEENEY
                    Well, that s a bit melodramatic.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Yes, I know it is.  My mom always 
                    used to say  when you don t know, 
                    ask.   So this is me asking.

                          (voice still sweet)
                    Certainly.  Carolyn and I were 
                      practitioners of breath play.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    I m sorry, what is  breath play? 

      Will leans toward Alicia, out of the corner of his mouth:

                                  WILL
                    Oh god.

                                  SWEENEY
                    Well, I m sure they have it in 
                    Michigan too, Miss Crozier.  Breath 
                    play is erotic asphyxiation.  Carolyn 
                    liked the feeling of being strangled 
                    when she was having sex.

      Silence in the court.  Crozier lets it sit there.  Alicia 
      glances at Charlotte in the gallery.  But she s looking down, 
    her head in her hands, devastated.

                                  NANCY CROZIER
                    Oh.  I see.  I think I d better sit

      Crozier turns to Alicia with a killer s smile...

      Will comes down the hallway with Alicia, Kalinda and Cary--

                                  WILL
                    Okay, we go on the offensive.  I m 
                    not letting some 26-year-old law 
                    school grad get the better of me.

                                  ALICIA
                    It s an act.  

                                  WILL
                    It s working.  So if we can t prove 
                    our guy s innocent, we need to 
                    shovel dirt on somebody else.

                    Charlotte?  The jury feels sorry 
                    for her-- she lost her mother.  If 
                    we suggest she s the killer--

                                  KALINDA
                          (shakes her head)
                    Go after the sister, Mariel.  
                    Suggest shewas the killer. 

                                  ALICIA
                    The jury liked her.

                                  CARY
                    They didn t like her. They believed her.

                    Okay, I m listening.

                                  CARY
                    Mariel was jealous of her sister.  
                    She slept with Sweeney to get back 
                    at her.  In my experience that 
                    level of jealousy doesn t just end.  
                    Did the cops even check heralibi?

                                  KALINDA
                    Supposedly she was in rehab when 
                    Carolyn disappeared.  

                                  WILL
                    Okay.  Get a subpoena for the 
                    records.  And Alicia, if we re 
                    tearing down the sister s alibi-- 
                    we need to shore up Sweeney s.

                                  ALICIA
                    How fun.

                    these days.

      INT.  SWEENEY S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY2222

      Sweeney sits as Alicia stands, glancing at some of the 
      artwork on the walls.  Keeping her distance.  

                                  SWEENEY
                    I told you, I was in my car, on the

                    With no GPS, and no cell phone.

    She pauses at a particularly disturbing manga picture. A 
      crying Japanese woman, teardrops as big as matchbooks.   

                                  SWEENEY
                    You like Manga?  I find the style 
                    bracingly visceral.

                                  ALICIA
                    You weren t really driving back 
                    from St. Louis, were you?

                                  SWEENEY
                    No.  

      Sweeney.  Serious for a moment.  All pretense gone.

                                  ALICIA
                    You know we re losing?

                    Yes.

                                  ALICIA
                    So no jokes, no lies, no

      Sweeney stares at her.  Nods.  And...

                    You re kidding, right?

    He points at a guy in the doorway of a rundown row house.  

      EXT. WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO -  CITY STREET - DAY2525

      MARCO.  30, African-American.  He glares at an approaching 
      Alicia and Sweeney.  A weirder trio you could not imagine.

                                  MARCO
                    My time s like anything else.  One 
                    hundred percent negotiable.

    But Sweeney s already forking over a pair of fifties.  

                                  SWEENEY
                    Marco, this is my lawyer.  I need 
                    you to tell her where I was the day 
                    my wife disappeared.

                    I got here about three-thirty like 
                    I always do.  You rolled up after 
                    that, looking to score some opie--

                          (to Alicia)
                    Opium.  Sometimes mixed with hash.

                                  MARCO
                    You bought me out and took off.  
                    After that-- hell if I know.

      Alicia looks at Sweeney in disbelief.  

                                  SWEENEY
                    I lit up in my car.  Next thing I 
                    remember, I was at home, waiting 
                    for Carolyn.  Now you see why I 
                    didn t tell you before?

                                  ALICIA
                    You didn t do it?

                    Kill Carolyn?  No.

                                  ALICIA
                    So why the games, the jokes?

                                  MARCO
                    Do you guys mind?  I m working here.

      Right.  Sweeney and Alicia start away, Sweeney considering 
      Alicia s question...

                    Right, nice to see you.  I hope we 
                    can make a deal today.  I hate this

                    Yes.  Will suggested we start, and 
                    he ll join us later.

      Alicia studies her, as they walk back towards the conference 
      room.  Something vacant in her eyes.  The arrogance and 
      narcissism of youth.  Alicia takes a second...

                    Your witness, Mariel, she doesn t

                    murder.  She left rehab at 4.

                    And, what, she rushed over to kill

                    The jury didn t hate her.  They

                    No.  Charlotte lost her mother to

                    from the estate.  Charlotte will 
                    offer him a yearly stipend.  Low

    By the way, all of this is spoken within her usual character 
    and voice.  There is no dropping of her personae.

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  Sweeney has an alibi.

                    And I m sure it s a good one.  It ll 
                    be fun to try to prove it. 

      Just then Nancy s Blackberry buzzes.  And as she checks it--
      Alicia s phone buzzes.  She checks hers-- her eyes widening--  
    as Nancy looks up from her Blackberry, smiling--

                    you.  I love your jacket.  My mom has 
                    one just like it.

    And Nancy exits, leaving Alicia staring at her phone-- then 
      Alicia turns and bolts out of the room, towards...

      INT.  28TH FLOOR - DIANE S OFFICE - DAY2727

      ...where Will stands, watching the TV monitor.  On it: police 
      cars at some kind of construction site-- excavators and earth-
      movers, holes in the ground--

                                  TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    --a construction crew made the grisly 
                    discovery this morning.  The site was 
                    formerly the location of Colin 
                    Sweeney s palatial mansion, but it was 
                    sold after the disappearance of his 
                    wife... 

      Alicia enters, sees shots of a football-shaped body bag being 
      carried off, soil samples being taken and bagged.

                    The remains, which were found in a

                    but investigators believe they belong 
                    to the missing Carolyn Armitage...  

      Alicia slumps against the door frame, looks at Will.

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t even know why I feel bad.  At

      INT.  SWEENEY S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY2929

      Alicia with a distraught Sweeney.  Again, she keeps her 
      distance--

                    Oh, don t even try it.

                                  SWEENEY
                    What?

                    Don t even patronize me with your tears.

      Sweeney turns away, composes himself, turns back.

                                  SWEENEY
                    I thought somewhere in the back of 
                    my mind-- and I will admit that it 
                    made no sense-- Carolyn might be 
                    still alive-- like Ken Lay, faking 
                    his own death, and hopping off to a 
                    small island somewhere.

      Alicia studies Sweeney.  Dammit.  Is this real emotion?

                                  ALICIA
                    You re saying you had nothing to do 
                    with this? 

                                  SWEENEY
                    I m saying I have done some 
                    terrible things in my life.  I 
                    have... But I did not kill my wife.

                                  ALICIA
                    Then how does her skull end up 
                    buried in your back yard?

      INT. FIRING RANGE - DAY3030

      Kalinda stands next to an uncomfortable Diane.  Her gun in 
    her hand.  A silent firing range.  Just the two of them.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    43.

                                  KALINDA
                    The grip is still.  
                          (holding out her gun hand)
                    The focus is on the front sight. 

      Diane reluctantly raises her gun hand.  Focuses on the front 
      sight.  And the shadow target in the distance. 

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Are you steady?

                                  DIANE
                    I think so.

                                  KALINDA
                          (lowers her voice)
                    Now the hardest part.  The trigger.  
                    There is a natural tendency for the 
                    muscles in your hand and wrist to 
                    move in tandem with your finger.  A 
                      sympathetic reaction.  You need to 
                    resist that.  You need to let your 
                    forefinger act independently, 
                    squeezing.  Do you understand?

                                  DIANE
                    I think so.

                                  KALINDA
                    And so, with almost no pressure at 
                    all, you concentrate on the center 
                    of the target...

                                  DIANE
                          (still quietly)
                    Why can t I shoot to injure?

                                  KALINDA
                    You pick up a gun, you shoot to 
                    kill.  Or you don t pick up a gun.

      Diane takes a long intake of breath, then... lowers her gun.

                    He got out.  Your parolee.

                    They are a shadow target, a bullseye.

                    So you dehumanize them?

                    They aredehumanized.  The world 
                    doesn t march to your drummer.  It is 
                    sometimes bad, dangerous, cruel.  So 
                    slowly, carefully raise your weapon...
                          (Diane reluctantly does so)

                    of your fist, arm, and gently, 
                      indifferently focus on your target, 
                    and... squeeze.

      BOOOOOM!--Diane shoots, her bullet firing through the head 
    of her target.  Not a bullseye but not too far off either.

                                  WILL
                    You were sending money away to your 
                    aunt in rehab?  And you didn t want 
                    your mother to know--

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    That s not true. 

                                  WILL
                    So Carolyn knew you were doing this?

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    No-- I-- not at first, but--

                                  WILL
                    And when she found out, she was angry?

      Nancy Crozier looks over toward the jury.  For the first time 
      they seem to be siding with the defense.  Damn.

                    A maggot?

                                  LI
                    Not just any maggot.  This little 
                    fellow is usually found in rural 
                    areas, often near livestock... But 
                    this was buried behind Sweeney s 
                    house, within the city limits.

      Kalinda considers that, as...

                    What s even more unusual is that 
                    it s here at all. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Why wouldn t a maggot be on a corpse?

                                  LI
                    Oh it would, as long as there were 
                    flesh to eat.  But after two years 
                    I d expect to find a clean skull.  A 
                    head with so much tissue still 
                    preserved suggests contaminants in 
                    the soil-- usually lead or arsenic--

                                  KALINDA
                    Arsenic was used in pesticides?

                    Until they banned it in the 1970 s. 
                    But if it was used before that, 
                    there d still be concentrations of 
                    it in the soil. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Pesticides like those used on a farm?  

                                  LI
                    Maybe.  Why?

                    You know who lives on a farm... in

      Amber Madison.  She smiles out at the court.  Enjoying 
      herself as Landry questions her... 

                                  AMBER
                    Peter is the sort of man who expects 
                    things to be handed to him. Like I was.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    49.

                                  LANDRY
                    This was at the hotel?

                                  AMBER
                    Yes.  I had a room.  He called his 
                    wife, said he d be late.  Afterwards, 
                    he asked me if he could see me again.

                                  LANDRY
                    How many times?

    As she continues to answer questions, we move toward the 
      double doors at the back of the court.

                                  AMBER
                    Two dozen.  It went on for months.  
                    Sometimes two, three times a week.

      Through the double doors, we glide, finding...

                                  LANDRY (O.S.)
                    And he knew you were being... 
                    provided to him?

                                  AMBER (O.S.)
                    Yes.  Afterwards, I would make a 
                    call in order to get paid.  He 
                    heard me make those calls.

                    Mrs. Florrick.

                    Would you like to come in?

      Alicia eyes Childs.  An intense stare.  Then Childs just nods 
    to her, enters on his own, and we follow him to...

      INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - COURTROOM #18 - DAY3838

      ...his seat, as Landry continues...

                                  LANDRY
                    Did Mr. Florrick ever say anything 
                    about having to do something in 
                    return for your... services?

                                  AMBER
                    Yes.  He told me that the men who 
                    paid me had cases against them.  
                    And Peter understood that he had to 
                    do something about those cases.

                                  LANDRY
                     Do something? 

                                  AMBER
                    Make them go away.  He laughed about 
                    it, actually.  He said it was the 
                    price of doing business in Chicago.

      Amber finally meets Peter s gaze, gives him a smile.  An 
      assassin s smile.  Landry sits, as Golden stands for cross.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Ms. Madison-- you say Mr. Florrick 
                    knew that someone else was paying 
                    for your services, is that correct?

                                  AMBER
                    Yes.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Then why would he pay you as well?

                                  AMBER
                    He never did.

    Now Golden produces a document, hands a copy to Amber, to 
      Landry, and to Judge Winter.

                                  GOLDEN
                    You recognize this?

                    No.

                                  GOLDEN
                    It s bank records, for an account 
                    in the name of Loretta Krispinsky. 
                    That s your real name, isn t it?
                          (no answer)
                    This particular account was closed 
                    some time ago, but the transactions 
                    are there.  Repeated deposits in 
                    the amount of $3,500.00.  

      Golden now hands over copies of another document.

                    Mr. Florrick s personal accounts.  
                    With corresponding withdrawals in 
                    that same amount, $3,500.00.  And 
                    always within a day or two of when 
                    you deposited the money.

      Amber looks at the document, busted.

                    I ll remind you, you re under oath,

                    You were paid by your procurer who

                    Florrick for his services.  And you

      Amber.  She is silent, staring out at Landry who frowns slightly.

                                  AMBER
                    You can make numbers look like

      Dark.  Diane awake in bed.  Listening.  A distant siren.  Her 
      eyes flitting toward her door with each sound.  Then...

      ...CREAK.  This creak sounds different very specific.  A door 
      opening downstairs.  Diane s eyes widen slightly.  She looks 
      toward her bedside drawer.  She reaches out one arm carefully 
      toward it.  Slowly and silently she opens the drawer, when--

      --klunk--something drops to the floor downstairs, knocked off 
      a shelf?  Diane pulls out...

      ...her Beretta.  She hears another creak.  Closer.  Another 
      door.  She keeps the gun close to her.  Security blanket 
      close.  She carefully and silently pops out the magazine.  No 
      awkwardness now as she reaches into...

      ...a box of ammunition, takes out a few bullets.  Keeps one 
    eye on the door, and-- click-click-click-- pops in three 
      bullets.  She looks toward...

      ...her bedroom door.  Sound getting closer.  Diane raises her 
      gun.  Flips the safety.  Waits.  Heart pumping.  And...

      ...the door opens.  Wider, wider.  

    She focuses on the front site, keeps it targeted on the 
      opening door, and finds... her dog, panting, coming through 
    the door.  She exhales, exhausted.  Of course.  She lowers 
    her gun.  Sighs.

                                  CHILDS
                    The catch is hardly worthy of its 
                    name.  The conviction stands.  You 
                    know you D.P. ed those cases, Peter.  
                    There s just the two of us here.  We 
                    can admit our failings to each other.

                                  PETER
                    You want me to let the guilty 
                    verdict stand?

                                  CHILDS
                    Yes.  With time served, you re home 
                    tomorrow.

                                  PETER
                    And my disbarment stands?

                                  CHILDS
                    Yes.

                                  PETER
                    And I could never run against you?

                                  CHILDS
                    That s right.  You have no chance, 
                    Peter.  You realize that.

                                  PETER
                    If I have no chance-- then why are 
                    you here?

                                  CHILDS
                    At a certain point, this has to move 
                    beyond retribution.  For both of us.  
                    You have to think about your family.  
                    Or... risk a failed appeal and 
                    another nine years in prison.  How 
                    old will you be then?  How old will 
                    your kids be?  Birthday parties.  
                      Boyfriends.  College graduations-- 
                    while you re in prison.

                    A life lived.  All while you... grow 
                    old in prison.

      Childs goes to the door.

                                  CHILDS (CONT D)
                    That s the deal.  Go home tomorrow.  
                    Or risk nine more years in prison.   
                    Think about it.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - DIANE S OFFICE - DAY4444

    The gun.  The Beretta.  Diane puts it on her desk.

                                  DIANE
                    I need you to take it.  I don t 
                    feel... comfortable anymore.

      Kalinda standing across from her.  She nods.

                                  KALINDA
                    You can be made comfortable.

                                  DIANE
                    I don t think so.  

                                  KALINDA
                    You re scared of it?

                                  DIANE
                    No... 
                          (faces the truth of this)
                    I m liking it.  

      Kalinda nods, understands, wraps the gun into the bag beside 
    it.  Takes it.

                                  KALINDA
                    I ll hold it for you.  

                                  DIANE
                    I m not going to change my mind.

      Kalinda nods, slips the gun into her jacket.

                                  KALINDA
                    I ll send you my bill.

      Kalinda smiles, exits.  As Diane sits there.  Looks off.  

      INT.  27TH FLOOR - ALICIA S OFFICE - DAY4545

      Alicia works at her desk, distracted, looking off, when she 
      sees a man approaching across the bullpen.  Sweeney.  
      Carrying a large rolled-up painting under his arm.  He comes 
    to the door...

                                  SWEENEY
                    Mrs. Florrick.  I brought you 
                    something.  A token of my esteem. 

    He unrolls the painting, revealing the manga print of the 
      woman s face, crying.

                                  SWEENEY (CONT D)
                    I thought it somehow strangely 
                      appropriate for you.

      Alicia takes the gift, at a loss for words.  Finally, in a 
      voice tinged with doubt--

                                  ALICIA
                    You didn t do it... did you?

                                  SWEENEY
                    Do what?

                                  ALICIA
                    Kill her.  Your wife.  Bury her in 
                      Charlotte s yard.

                                  SWEENEY
                    If I did that-- why would I keep 
                    the skull in my yard?

                                  ALICIA
                    To point us to Charlotte.

                                  SWEENEY
                    You re being paranoid, Mrs. 
                    Florrick.  Sometimes things are 
                    exactly as they seem.  The unlikely 
                    maneuver is exactly that: unlikely.

      Alicia studies him, says nothing.  Finally--

                                  SWEENEY (CONT D)
                    I have to go.  Congratulations.

    And Sweeney starts off.  Then turns back with a smile:


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    57.

                                  SWEENEY (CONT D)
                    You just have to trust people.

    And he goes.  Alicia watches him, appalled.  She looks back 
      down at the manga print: the crying woman.  And... her phone 
      intercom beeps.  A voice...

                                  RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                    Mrs. Florrick.  Your husband on 
                    line two.

      Alicia looks toward the phone.
