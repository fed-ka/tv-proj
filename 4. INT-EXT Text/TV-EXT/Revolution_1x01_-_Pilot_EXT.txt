The downtown SKYSCRAPERS.  Sears Tower.  Trump Tower.  John 
Hancock.  Each its own universe of gleaming electric light.

A river of TAXIS surge down Michigan Ave.  Shoulder-to-

their smartphones.  Precious few make eye contact.    

Finally-- a warm Lincoln Park TOWNHOUSE.

ACT ONE


A CHYRON:  15 YEARS AFTER THE BLACKOUT.   

The planet.  Just as shadowed.  Just as mysterious.  
Apparently, the lights never came back on.


Ben steps out of his front door.  Pads down the sidewalk.  We 
catch a piece of his modest house-- single-story, ranch-
style.  And for all the world, this seems like every typical 
American street in every typical American neighborhood.   

Until a NEIGHBOR-- CALEB, 50, stocky-- passes.  Rifle slung 
over his back-- WHEELING a DEAD DEER on a MAKE-SHIFT WAGON-- 
 perfectly NORMAL--and even weirder-- Ben reacts like it s

SMALL PATCHES of CROPS-- corn, carrots, wheat.  9.


A row of BULKY COMPUTER MONITORS-- screens replaced with WIRE 
MESH-- now used as CHICKEN COOPS.  

A SHEPHERD leads his FLOCK of SHEEP across the suburban 
blacktop--

Ben passes a faded OLD BRICK SIGN that announces the 
neighborhood: SYLVANIA ESTATES.  Then approaches-- 

MAGGIE, 39.  British.  Beautiful.  No nonsense.  The VILLAGE 
DOCTOR.  She stands beside AARON, 37, lovably neurotic.  He 
hates nature and nature hates him.  

 RED, SPLOTCHY ARM--Maggie applies a thick balm to Aaron s

BEN
What happened to you?

AARON

MAGGIE
They left early.  Said they were 
going hunting--

Ben sighs.  He has his doubts.   

BEN
They better be.


A RUSTLE in the verdant TREELINE.  Then-- emerging into a 
 naturally nice, tight HERO SHOT-- CHARLIE, now 20.  She s
lovely.  And LUMINESCENT with CURIOSITY--10.


CHARLIE
Check it out--

She moves-- towards a four-lane INTERSTATE.  A TEN CAR PILE 
UP.  Rusted Toyotas, Fords, Chevy s.  Left where they died.  
CRUNCHED into each other.  A sculpture of twisted metal.  
People clearly lost their lives here.  

At one end-- an overturned MOTORHOME.  ON ITS SIDE.    

Charlie bee-lines for it.  Behind her-- DANNY, 17.  Her 
brother.  Bright, capable.  He eyes the RV, dubious.  

DANNY

With remarkable agility-- Charlie CLAMBERS up the MOTORHOME.  
On the top-- the DOOR.  Charlie STRAINS a bit against the 
rust-- but WRENCHES IT OPEN--

CHARLIE
Wait here.

And with that, she DROPS DOWN into the RV.  Danny sighs.  
Follows his sister.  He always follows his sister.  


Six or seven VILLAGE KIDS sit, disinterested, in the grass.  
They ve got TORN, DOG-EARED PHYSICS TEXTBOOKS.  Aaron stands 
before them.  Their teacher.  He scratches at his itchy, 
bandaged arm.  Then he holds up a POTATO.  

AARON
Okay, gang, so this was an 
experiment when I was a kid.  

He plugs two WIRES into the potato-- attached to a small 
digital clock--

SPENCER
Nothing s happening.

AARON
Exactly.  Jack squat is happening.  
Why?  Anyone?  Raise your hand--    

SPENCER
Because of the Blackout.

AARON
This is my point.  It wasn t just a

generators.  Friggin  potatoes.
(off their boredom, Aaron 
levels with them)
 Okay, look.  I know learning isn t
as cool-- or frankly useful-- as 
bowhunting or whatever.  But still-- 
this should bother you.  The world 
pretty much went insane-- overnight 
-- and no one knows why--

SPENCER
My Dad says it was because of God.  
 angry at us.  Because He s13.


AARON
(long suffering sigh)
Shut up, Spencer.

Suddenly-- Charlie and Danny CRASH through the bushes, next 
 a HOT MESS.  Charlie to this impromptu classroom.  They re
 in the midst of an ASTHMA ATTACK--SHOULDERS Danny, who s

CHARLIE
MAGGIE!  

DOWN THE STREET.  Maggie clips herbs.  Her head shoots up-- 
immediately sees the ruckus down the street.  She HAULS ASS--

Maggie is calm and assured as she reaches Danny-- 

MAGGIE
 Okay, Danny, just relax, you re
gonna be alright--

OFF CHARLIE.  Sick with worry--


A rickety CARNIVAL FERRIS WHEEL.  A TREE HAS GROWN UP and 
THROUGH the TOWERING LATTICE.  It s haunting, picturesque.    

This is where Charlie comes to think.  She hikes up.  Gazes 
at the wheel.  Melancholy.

Then, from a nearby STONE WALL, she pries a large LOOSE ROCK.  
Hidden in the gap INSIDE-- a LOCKBOX.   

She sits.  Opens it.  Revealing: the contents of her heart.  
Precious remnants from the old days.  An iPOD.  Some COINS.  
And... FADED POSTCARD after POSTCARD.  Los Angeles.  The 
Chicago Skyline.  

She adds her latest prize-- the NEW YORK POSTCARD.  She 
intently examines them all.  Snapshots of a world she 
desperately wants to know.  But never will...


Through the FOLIAGE... a soft RUSTLE... as a graceful BUCK 
t see-- huge.  Foraging.  He doesn emerges.  He s

DANNY.  VERY high up on a TOWERING tree branch.  An 
accomplished climber.  

Quiet, assured, Danny aims a CROSSBOW.  Takes calm, perfect 
aim-- a beat-- 

Then a SUDDEN RUMBLE-- startled, the deer darts off--

Danny.  What the hell is that?  Then, from his high vantage 
point, he spots--

A WAGON.  Winding down a FOREST ROAD.  The wagon s partially 
shielded by the branches.  But Danny can still make out two 
horses.  Multiple men.  And a distinctive SYMBOL-- an 
 PAINTED on the side...ENCIRCLED  M --


The wagon rounds the corner.  And we finally get a good look.  
 a DODGE RAM 3500 FLATBED TRUCK.  Pulled by TWO HORSES. It s17.


The truck carries TEN SOLDIERS.  All wearing olive green 
 on their shoulder patches.uniforms.  That same ENCIRCLED  M 

And the residents react.  With FEAR.  And HATE.  Parents 
hurry children inside.  Hard looks from stalwart men.  

MAGGIE.  She steps forward.  Eyes the Militia.  Anxious.  
When she sees-- in an alley between two houses--

 STRANGE-- Ben is BEN AND AARON.  It sSTRESSED, SPEAKING 
ARDENTLY to Aaron.  Aaron is PALE, SHAKING HIS HEAD-- NO!  
But Ben is INSISTENT.  CLASPINGS HANDS. AARON 

CLOSE ON MAGGIE.  What the hell is that about?  

CLOSE ON AARON.  As Ben steps over to the soldiers.  Leaving 
Aaron behind.  Aaron looks down at his hands-- Ben just gave 
him the SILVER PENDANT NECKLACE-- the FLASHDRIVE NECKLACE 
from the Tease!  Why?  What s this mean?  What s Aaron know?    

The wagon stops.  Soldiers hop out.  One holds a RIFLE.  
Others carry battle-tested SWORDS with casual menace-- and 
none of that Medieval Times bullshit.  This is the real deal.

Their LEADER-- CAPTAIN TOM NEVILLE, 40, saunters up.  Ben 
 some kind of steps forward to meet him; clearly, Ben s
community leader.  

Neville speaks with a genteel Southern twang that, in any 
 find charming.  other context, you d

The TOWN RESIDENTS stiffly watch this exchange.  Maggie.  
Aaron.  Caleb-- the DEER HUNTER-- RIFLE strung over his back.       

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
 here under orders from General I m
Sebastian Monroe himself.  He 
specifically asked me to find two 
men-- you.  And your brother Miles.  
And well-- one down, one to go.   

BEN
Wait.  Just hold on--

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
I have to ask you to come with us.  
Under the authority of the Monroe 
Republic.

BEN

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
Honestly, sir.  Above my paygrade.  
But if the General wants to see 
you, must be pretty goddam heavy. 

CLOSE ON AARON.  Watching Ben closely.

Ben flicks his eyes to the SOLDIERS.  Sizing them up.  

One YOUNG PRIVATE loads his RIFLE.  But the way they did in 
the Civil War.  Gun powder.  A lead ball.  A ramrod.  

BEN

Neither do I.  Neither do your 
neighbors,m sure.  Which is why  I

Beat.  Ben regards his friends.  He knows what Neville could 
do.  Ben gives a small, forlorn nod.  

MAGGIE

Ben pivots to her.  They whisper, fast and harsh--

BEN

The other SOLDIERS tense.  That Young Private raises his 
rifle at Danny.  But Captain Neville only seems amused.  

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
I suppose this is your boy? 

DANNY
You can t take him--

BEN
Put it down, Danny.  Goddammit, 
now!

But Danny refuses.  Then... Caleb RAISES HIS RIFLE, too. 

CALEB

they put theirs down?  

Soldiers MOVE to CALEB.  VILLAGERS BLOCK their way.  Gripping 
FARM TOOLS-- AXES.  MACHETES.

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
Why, lookee here.  Isn t this 
dramatic?  

Ben is aghast.  Quickly and completely losing control of the 
situation.  He circles to the Young Private.  Stands before 
that rifle.  Hands up.  Blocking the shot on Danny. 

BEN
(to his neighbors)
Listen to me.  You can t win.  They 
will burn us down.

CAPTAIN NEVILLE

Ben FOCUSES IN on Danny when he says this--

BEN

let me go. 

CLOSE-UPS.  Neville.  Ben.  Maggie.  Danny.  Hands grip 
weapons, fingers quiver on triggers.  A tense beat--


CLOSE ON CHARLIE.  BANG!  She hears the SHOT, ECHOED in on 
the wind.  Whips her head to the sound source.  

Walks towards it.  Then RUNS-- SCARED--


Ben stands.  Confused.  A frozen moment.  Then...

BLOOD DRIBBLES from his mouth.  He drops to his knees.  As 
CRIMSON BLOSSOMS across his chest.

Danny.  Stares, speechless, at the Young Private with the now-
smoking rifle.     

Maggie.  HORRIFIED.  Then her training kicks in.  She 
crouches beside Ben.  Immediately applies pressure.      

Captain Neville WHIRLS on the Young Private--

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
You stupid sonofabitch-- 

YOUNG PRIVATE
 sorry, I--Sir, I m21.


But he never finishes that sentence.  Because--

Danny FIRES THAT CROSSBOW-- the ARROW TWIRLS through the air-- 
then EMBEDS in the Young Private s CHEST-- he SPURTS BLOOD-- 
then drops to the dirt--

And now everything happens at once-- 

Caleb SHOOTS, DROPS a SOLDIER-- another SOLDIER SWORD-SLASHES 
a FARMER across the TORSO-- another FARMER BURIES his AXE in 
 GUT--yet another SOLDIER S

CAPTAIN NEVILLE.  HOLY SHIT, this guy is SCARY with a blade.  
He HACKS, SLASHES-- with preternatural ability-- wiping out 
one ARMED FARMER after another-- he SLAUGHTERS CALEB without 
hesitation-- barely LOOKING at him--

 about to reload-- but two SOLDIERS CLUTCH HIM-- he Danny s
 gonna slice him-- except--FIGHTS like HOLY HELL-- they re

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
Stop!  I want him alive!  


Charlie.  RACING.  Back home.  Desperate.  Fast as her legs 
will carry-- 


Danny.  Hands bound.  Soldiers SHOVE him into the flatbed.

MAGGIE
No... no!  

And Maggie CLAWS at the Soldiers like a lioness.  Struggling 
to hold onto Danny.  But a Soldier CLOCKS her in the face 
with the rifle butt-- she collapses into the dirt, out cold--

Aaron races to her, supports her neck--

Neville crouches before Ben.  Who s alive, but bleeding out--

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
Sir, I am sorry.  This is the last 
thing I wanted.
(then)
But if I can t have you-- I have to 
take your son...

Off Ben-- drowning-- in this NIGHTMARE--22.



Charlie.  Out of breath.  Exhausted.  

When she EXPLODES out of the woods-- and she freezes-- her 
eyes widen-- uncomprehending--

s gone.  But MULTIPLE CORPSES  FUCKING CHAOS.  Wagon It s
sprawl in the street-- a few dead soldiers, but MORE DEAD 
FARMERS.  WIVES and CHILDREN WAIL over their fallen FATHERS-- 
a HUSBAND vainly performs CPR on his WIFE--  

But then Charlie is JOLTED back to reality when she sees-- 
Ben.  Crumpled on the ground.  Maggie beside him.  

CHARLIE
Dad!

She SLIDES in front of Ben.  As Maggie tries to stem the 
bleeding with a filthy rag.  

CHARLIE
 Danny, where is heWhere s??

They smile, heartbroken, at each other through the tears.

BEN
...you can do this, charlie... you 
have to do this...

CLOSE ON CHARLIE.  As she takes this in.  Her Father s dying 
command.  She nods, meaningful. 

Ben nods back, relieved.  Starts fading fast.  Turns to 
 even speak.  Clutches her hand in his--  Maggie.  He can t

MAGGIE
Shhh.  I know.  

She leans over.  Kisses him goodbye.    

Charlie watches this exchange.  A flood of mixed feelings.  

Finally, Ben turns back to Charlie.  He meets her eyes.  
 Trying to convey something.  Whatever it is... it s
important.  It s life or death.  But... he can t do it... his 
eyes swim... his breath quickens... and then he dies...

MAGGIE.  Openly sobs.    

CHARLIE.  Stoic.  Or in shock.  

AARON.  Turned away from them.  Tightly gripping the SILVER 
PENDANT NECKLACE... 


CUE MUSIC.  Something sad and sweet and evocative.  24.


A wide field, a pretty view, where the locals bury their 
dead.  SIX FRESH PLOTS today.  Lined with mournful people.  
 CLOSE ON Maggie and Aaron.      We re

A FARMER leads the burial service.  We can t hear his words--

And Charlie doesn t want to.  She stands outside the circle.  
s only one thing in the whole  all meaningless.  There It s
world that still has any meaning--

She pivots.  Walks away.  

Off Maggie.  Watching her.


Charlie.  Maggie.  Hefting large backpacks.  Walking down the 
empty street.  When, suddenly, unexpectedly--

Aaron falls into pace beside them, self-conscious.  Lugs his 
own pack--

CLOSE ON CHARLIE.  She pauses.  Takes one last look back-- 

Then heads into the woods.  Into the world.  Off this--

BLACKOUT.


END OF ACT ONE27.


ACT TWO


CHARLIE.  MAGGIE.  AARON.  Trek through one sprawling wide 
shot after another.  Like out of a John Ford picture.

Off Charlie.  She sighs.  Sees the wisdom of this--


Maggie.  Aaron.  Sit beside a FLICKERING CAMPFIRE.  Charlie 
is sprawled out.  Her back to them.  Apparently asleep.  
Aaron takes a long, quiet beat.  Then--

AARON
You think we ll find the kid? 

Maggie only stares into the fire.  Not very optimistic.  

ANGLE ON CHARLIE.  Her back away from the others.  As we 
reveal-- she s WIDE AWAKE.  She hears them.  She s SO FUCKING 
WORRIED-- and LONELY-- as we TRANSITION TO:


CLOSE ON CHARLIE.  A moment of melancholy.  Goddam, she 
 a long way from home...  misses her parents... and she s33.



 FLATBED.  CLOSE ON DANNY.  Riding in the back of Neville s
His wrist, CUFFED to the TRUCK RAILING.  Danny studies his 
feet-- avoiding all eye contact.  

Captain Neville.  Across from him.  He displays a certain 
amount of sympathy-- of humanity-- here.

Neville can toggle from friendly to ferocious that quickly--

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
 not forget-- Let syou raised your 
weapon first.  That puts your 
 blood on Daddy syour hands--

Danny locks eyes with Neville.  A long beat.  Then Danny 
drops his head.  Returns to studying the floor.  But--

DANNY S POV.  As we realize-- he s EXAMINING more than that-- 
where the RAILING meets the truck bed... a SCREW IS LOOSE.  
Just a bit.  But maybe enough... for Danny to GET FREE--


CHARLIE.  At the river s shore.  She takes a drink.  Splashes 
her face.  When she looks-- sees something up through the 
trees-- sees SOMEONE, to be exact.  She steps closer, 
cautious.  Wary.  Whoever they are, they could be dangerous--  

Charlie takes cover behind a tree.  Spies on-- A MAN.  NATE 
WALKER, 24.  Rough-around-the-edges handsome.  Shirt 
 hung a SMALL MIRROR from a branch.  Dry-unbuttoned.  He s
shaves with a straight-edge.  

Charlie.  Just... watching.  She hasn t had much interaction 
with guys her age-- especially ones as good looking as Nate.  

Then, unexpectedly, without turning, Nate CALLS OUT--

NATE
You know, a time like this, most 
   morning. people just say  good34.


Busted.  Cheeks flushed, Charlie steps from hiding--

CHARLIE
I, um-- yeah.  Good morning.

NATE
(charming grin)
  Nate. I m   Morning.

CHARLIE
Charlie.

NATE
Where you headed, Charlie?

CHARLIE
(volleys right back)
None of your damn business, Nate.

NATE
That is quite true.  

Long beat.  Silence.  They just feel the electricity sparking 
in the air between them.  Then-- 

MAGGIE (O.S.)
(calling out)
Charlie...?

CHARLIE
I gotta-- get back--

NATE
Okay.  Nice meeting you.    


Charlie returns to camp. 

MAGGIE
Where were you?

CHARLIE
Just getting some water--

Charlie busies herself-- readying her pack.  Off Maggie, 
wondering what Charlie was up to--


Charlie, Maggie, and Aaron emerge from the treeline, only to 
find... A HIGH FENCE.  A now-obsolete sign: AUTHORIZED 
PERSONNEL ONLY.  And whatever Charlie sees off-camera, it 
SIMPLY BLOWS HER SHIT AWAY.  Jaw open.  Gobsmacked.  35.


They all scale the fence.  Hop over--  

And as Charlie lands on the grass-sprouted asphalt, we CIRCLE 
around her, revealing in a WIDE SHOT--

HARE AIRPORT.  JETS  on the TARMAC.  Of CHICAGO O They re
EVERYWHERE.  Many of them COVERED with VINES.  A graveyard of

A CREEPY POV.  Watches them.  From behind a fuel truck.  
Someone is here.  And our heroes are oblivious...  

Aaron.  Notices a nearby 737.  The door is open.  A STAIRWAY 
WHEELED UP beside it. 

AARON
 Kit Come on.  They hide a Doctor s
up front.  Good meds.    

CHARLIE
How do you know?  

AARON

a roll of Charmin--


AGAIN-- that CREEPY POV.  WATCHING Charlie and Maggie through 
the airplane window.  STALKING CLOSER NOW...


Danny s MILITIA FLATBED.  Parked beside a thick woods.  Some 
Soldiers sleep around a CAMPFIRE.  Others lean against the 
truck tires, lightly snoring.

WORKING on that LOOSE SCREW.  

 excruciating work.  But His fingers are BLOODIED.  It s
still.  He focuses.  Tenacious...   38.



DANNY.  As finally... with a mousy SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK... he 
 able to wrench the RAIL from its base.  pries the screw!  He s
Just an inch.  But enough.   

He WINCES at the METALLIC SCRAPE, it s too loud, as he SLIDES 
 free!  The cuffs his CUFF down... and off the rail!  He s
dangle from one wrist.  

Now he quietly SLINKS OFF the truck.  But seeing-- he has to 
PICK his WAY PAST the Soldiers.  Through them.  As if a DEN 
of SLUMBERING LIONS.  

Here goes.  Danny carefully-- carefully-- steps over a man.  
Then another.  One ROUSES.  Danny freezes.  Then the guy 
returns to sleep.  Off Danny.  Tense.


DANNY.  Continues through the dozing troops.  The suspense is 
terrible.  Until... thank God... he s just about... MADE IT-- 

 Captain Neville!A HAND CLUTCHES HIS ANKLE!  It s

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
HEY!!40.


Danny HORSE-KICKS Neville in the face.  Neville GRUNTS, 
releases Danny-- who TEARS ASS into the forest!

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
 RUNNING!  GET UP!  HE S


DANNY.  Scrambles, blind, through the brush.  Branches slash 
his torso.  He trips over a root.  But still, he races.

A beat later.  Neville and his men chase.  Carrying TORCHES.  


Charlie, Maggie, and Aaron SCRAMBLE across the tarmac.  Back 
the way they came.  They reach the FENCE-- CLAMBER UP--  
Maggie makes it up and over.  Aaron, close behind. 

Charlie reaches the top.  When... SUDDENLY-- a MEATY HAND 
CLUTCHES HER ANKLE-- it s Trevor-- BLOOD stains the front of 
his shirt--

HE VIOLENTLY RIPS CHARLIE OFF-- she collapses back onto the 
pavement.  OOF.  That hurts.  

MAGGIE
Charlie!41.


Maggie and Aaron start scuttling their way back over.  FAST.  
 never make it in time--But they ll

Trevor clenches Charlie s throat.  Savage enough to crush her 
windpipe.  She flails.  Maybe Trevor s poisoned, maybe he s a 
 taking Charlie with him.  When--goner, but he s

THWACK!  From out of nowhere, an ARROW PLUNGES into Trevor s 
NECK.  A confused look.  An arterial spray.  Then he drops, a 
marionette with his strings cut.  

As we reveal-- NATE WALKER-- the young guy from the woods.  
Steps out from the trees behind Maggie and Aaron.  Bow in 
hand.  A perfect bulls-eye-- and through the fence, too.  

Charlie.  On the pavement.  Breathless.  She locks eyes with 
Nate.  Her savior.  

CHARLIE
...thank you.

NATE

CAPTAIN NEVILLE.  Reaches a clearing.  His men behind him.  

Danny s nowhere to be found.  Into thin air.  Captain Neville 
sharply whistles through his teeth.  Incensed.  

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
Split up.  He couldn t ve gone far.

separate, SCOURING the forest.  Then CAMERA FINDS--

DANNY.  Far above their heads, on a precarious tree branch 
 (putting his climbing skills to very good use).  He s
PETRIFIED.  Mopping sweat from his brow, hoping like HELL it

Off this, we--

BLACKOUT.

ACT THREE


Charlie.  Maggie.  Aaron.  And now-- Nate.  On the tarmac.  
Charlie does her best to replace her lockbox treasures.  
Carefully smooths out the crumpled photo of her parents. 

Charlie looks to Nate.  Nate smiles back.  But Maggie is 
suspicious--

MAGGIE
So, Nate, was it?  What were you 
doing way out here?  

NATE
On my way to Chicago.  Hoping to 
get on a fishing crew.  You?

Maggie shoots Charlie a look.  But Charlie brushes her off--

CHARLIE

MAGGIE

Maggie yanks Charlie away.  Aaron joins them.  They confer--

MAGGIE
So, those assholes last night-- you 
 learn didn tanything? 

CHARLIE
Yeah, sure-- we could use a guy who 
can take care of himself.

No offense.

CLOSE ON MAGGIE.  Haunted-- and guarded.  She d like to have 
Charlie s optimism.  But she s seen too much.  


DANNY.  Nervous.  Glancing over his shoulder.  Emerging from 
the forest.  Heading into tall grass.  


Danny now treads down a DIRT ROAD that winds between AMBER 
FIELDS of SHIMMERING WHEAT.  Out of an Andrew Wyeth painting.   
The wind blows, BACKLIT DUST and POLLEN BILLOW.

Danny COUGHS.  Throat irritated.  As he passes a classic, 
faded, paint-peeling AMERICAN FARMHOUSE.  With the wind and 
 all seriously eerie.  the dust and the farmhouse-- it s

Danny carries on.  But then... he coughs HARDER.  Then begins 
to WHEEZE.  The dust and pollen are too much for him.  He 
stops.  Knows he s in trouble.  A FULL BLOWN ASTHMA ATTACK.  

Off Danny.  Drops to his knees.  SUFFOCATING-- this time, 
with no one to help--


Our heroes weave down the EXPRESSWAY.  CHOKED with cars, 
bumper to bumper.  Maggie frowns, displeased, up at-

 just told him her story.  He reacts-- Charlie and Nate.  She s
genuine and sympathetic--

NATE
...that is just-- I lost my 
parents, when I was fifteen.  So I 
get it-- I m sorry--

CHARLIE
Thanks.  

NATE
m sure your  worry... I And... don t
 okay...brother s44.


CLOSE ON CHARLIE.  She nods her gratitude.  Then looks 
forward.  Astounded.  They ve come around a bend, REVEALING--

THE CHICAGO SKYLINE.  Sears Tower.  Trump Tower.  ONLY-- 
COLOSSAL.  STILL.  VACANT.  Vines creep up the JOHN HANCOCK.  
It defies description.  A mind-boggling sight.


Night s fallen, by the time our weary travelers finally reach 
their destination-- the DRAKE HOTEL.  On Walton Place.  Ten 
stories.  A Grand Dame of Art Deco.   

Charlie gazes up at it.  

CHARLIE
He lives here?

So Maggie crouches.  Quickly and efficiently PICKS IT.  Then

MAGGIE
What?  You d rather wait  till

A CORNER MARKET.  As-- SMASH!  SOMEONE throws a GARBAGE CAN 
through the window-- it SHATTERS!  

FRIGHTENED PEOPLE storm inside-- gathering as many SOUP CANS 
and DRY GOODS as they can carry.  In front of this CHAOS--

Ben Matheson.  Eyes ahead.  Wears a heavy backpack.  Pushes a 
stroller-- Danny inside-- down the middle of the avenue.   

Rachel Matheson.  Backpack.  Holds Charlie, 5, tight.  
Charlie whimpers at the surrounding violence.  So, again, 
Rachel sings to her.  Soft and gentle.  Voice quivering--

RACHEL
...but if you wanna leave, take 
good care... I hope you make a lot 
of nice friends out there...


By the time Miles bursts from the saloon door--

Off Miles, screwed beyond repair--

BLACKOUT!

NEVILLE EXPLODES from the wheat stalks!  TACKLES Danny from 
the side.  They both ROLL--

Neville, pro that he is, quickly gains the upper hand.

Neville is ENRAGED-- and we think he just might kill the kid-- 
just to be RID of this FUCKING PAIN IN THE ASS--

But Neville only YANKS Danny to his feet.  

Off Danny-- barren--


 outside the locked saloon doors.  As... Nate steps We re
 before them.  Followed by the LOCAL SQUAD SERGEANT, 30 s--
battle-tested, salty, cautious.  He leads TWENTY MEN.  

The Sergeant throws a hand signal.  All in.

NATE
What are you doing? 

  wary attitude, we can tell-- Miles From the Sergeant s
reputation precedes him.  

SERGEANT
Look, maybe he s long gone by now.  
But if this is really Miles 
 still Matheson, and he shere... 
 not taking any chances.I m58.



Charlie.  Miles.  Maggie.  Aaron.  Skyline at their back.   
Striding forward.  With energy, with purpose.  When Aaron 
whispers an aside to Maggie-- eyes on Miles--

AARON
Does make you wonder, though.  

MAGGIE
What?

AARON
I mean, a guy like that-- chews 
 he iron and spits nails.  So why s
scared of Monroe?

Maggie looks to Aaron. Great question--

MILES.  Face cloudy with apprehension.  As we TRANSITION TO:


Miles, 24 again.  Back with his best friend Bass; back in the 
Teaser.  Watching in horror as--

SMASH!  A SEMI TRUCK, out of nowhere, POUNDS into their 
friend Oliver!  Utterly OBLITERATES HIM.  Before it PLUNGES 
off the exit ramp.  64.


Miles SCRAMBLES to the side of the ramp-- desperate to make 
his way down to Oliver-- 

BELOW.  The truck is spewing gasoline.  Small flames grow--

MILES
Ollie!  OLLIE!  

But Bass holds back a THRASHING MILES--

BASS
Stop-- Miles, STOP!s dead--  He  
 gonna blow--that truck s

Finally, Miles looks at Bass-- returning to his senses--

BASS
We gotta get back to base-- you 
hear me-- we gotta get back.  


Bass and a dazed Miles head down the dark street.  They 
pause, absolutely bewildered, as they pass-- 

A DOWNED MILITARY HELICOPTER.  On its side.  Just burning.  
No hydrants or fire trucks to put it out.  

They reach the GUARD GATE.  Stop before the GUARD on duty--

BASS
 reporting in.We re

GUARD
Names?

It takes a beat for Miles to focus.  Then, he shows his I.D.

MILES
Lance Cpl. Miles Matheson.

CLOSE ON BASS.  As he does the same.  

BASS
Staff Sgt. Sebastian Monroe.

The revelation sinks in-- BASS is GENERAL MONROE!  As the two 
friends race off to their barracks... we TRANSITION BACK TO:


  We ride it to the end. Wild World.   CUE SONG.  Cat Stevens 

CLOSE ON MILES.  And yes.  He is scared.   65.


WIDER.  Charlie, Maggie, and Aaron.  Beside Miles.  As this 
new family ventures into this epic new America.    

EVEN WIDER.  Now revealing-- NATE.  Enigmatic.  He watches.  
Through binocs.  At a safe distance.  TRACKING THEM. 


DANNY.  Re-cuffed.  Captain Neville beside him.  As the wagon 
rolls down the interstate.  Through a now-abandoned, now-
pointless TOLL GATE.  On its way to Monroe...
