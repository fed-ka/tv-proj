      PATRICK JANE looks directly to camera.  He uses his hands to 
      accentuate his words and subtly shape Lisbon s response.

                                  JANE
                    Look at me.  Look in my eyes.

      ANGLE -- He s sitting opposite LISBON, who looks in his eyes.  
      RIGSBY and VAN PELT watch in happy anticipation. 

                                  LISBON
                    I m looking. 

                                   JANE 
                    Imagine a simple geometric shape.  
                    Any shape you like.  Picture it in 
                    your mind as strongly as you can, 
                    so that I can see it too.  

                                  LISBON
                    Okay. 

                                  JANE
                    Good.  Now, around that first shape 
                    I want you to put another simple 
                    shape, any shape you like.  Around 
                    the first shape.  Picture it in 
                    your mind.  Clear as you can.  Make 
                    a mental photograph.  Tell me when 
                    you have it clear.

                                  LISBON
                    Okay.  It s clear.  

      Jane gazes deep into her eyes.

                                  JANE 
                    I see a triangle.  Inside a circle.

      Lisbon grins.

                    No.

                    No?

                                  LISBON
                    I was thinking of an octagon inside 
                    a square.

                                  JANE
                    Liar.

                                  LISBON
                    All right.  You got me.

      Van Pelt and Rigsby laugh delightedly.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Pretty good uh?  He got me and Rigs 
                    the same way.


                                  JANE
                    That s nothing.  That s just the 
                      calibration key for the real mind 
                    reading.  Now I have total access 
                    to your innermost thoughts.

                                  LISBON
                    Yeah right.  

                                  JANE
                    No, seriously.

                                  LISBON
                    So what am I thinking?

                                  JANE 
                    You re thinking thank God he s  
                    joking around and can t really read 
                    my mind.  

                                  LISBON
                    No.  Well, yes actually, but not 
                    for the reason you think...

                                  JANE
                    What reason do I think?

      Lisbon realizes he s trapping her.

                    Never you mind...

                    Hah, you re blushing. 

      Lisbon gives him a stern glance, and Rigsby looks abashed.

                                  JANE
                    You are, though.

      Just then, much to Lisbon s relief, CHO enters. 

                                  CHO
                    We re up.  Suspected arson/murder 
                    on a farm in Marquesa.  The County 
                    DA is asking if we ll check it out.


      A simple nicely-appointed farmer s home.  The kitchen table 
      groans with every potluck dish imaginable.  Lisbon and Jane 
      enter with Piller.  

      They meet SUSAN GARCIA, mid-30s, pretty in a girl-next-door 
      way, palely glowing with grief, holding it together.  NB -- 
      There s other women drifting in and out being vaguely 
      helpful, as is usual at times like this.   

                                  PILLER
                    Susan, these folks are from the 
                      California Bureau of Investigation.  
                    They re going to find out who did 
                    this to Rich.

      JANE S POV -- When Piller touches Susan, she shies away very 
      slightly.  There s something skittish about the way Susan and 
      Piller interact.  Both of them constrained by some unspoken 
      tension.  

                                  SUSAN
                    Hi, nice to meet you.  Thank you 
                    for coming.  I uh, are you hungry?  
                    There s more than enough.  

                                  JANE
                          (hungry)
                    Hmmmm.   

                                  LISBON
                          (warning glance at Jane)
                    No, thank you, Mrs. Garcia.  

      BEN MACHADO, 30, steel under the can-do charm, enters from 
      the kitchen.

                                    MACHADO
                    Maddy s in her room.  I did some KP 
                    with the dishes and brought in the 
                    firewood.  So you re all set.

                                  SUSAN
                    Thank you.

                                    MACHADO
                    You need anything?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     9.

                    No, Ben.  I m good.  Thank you so 
                    much.  These are the State Police 
                    people.

      Machado shakes Lisbon and Jane s hands, firm but friendly.

                                    MACHADO
                    Ben Machado.  Anything you need, 
                    just say the word, you got it.

                                  PILLER
                    Ben s our go-to guy in Marquesa. 

                                    MACHADO
                    He means I m the only real estate 
                    agent around that ll take his 
                      commission in fertilizer and 
                    chickens.

                                  JANE
                    And you were in the 192nd also?

                                    MACHADO
                          (how did you know?)
                    That s right. 

                                  JANE
                    You have that military bearing.  

                                  PILLER
                    Rich and Ben and me and a couple 
                    other guys ran a platoon together.

                                    MACHADO
                    Been through a whole lot.  And then 
                    for this to happen?  Right here at 
                    home?  You re going to catch the 
                    bastard who did this ASAP, right?

                                  LISBON
                    We ll certainly try.

                                    MACHADO
                    Guess that ll have to do.
                          (to Susan)
                    See you in the morning. 

      Machado exits with Piller.  (Jane has noted -- as we might 
      also -- that Piller and Susan have carefully avoided eye 
      contact throughout, though there was a yearning look in 
      Piller s gaze).




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     10.

                      questions...

      Jane ghosts his way from the room.


      Jane finds a PHOTO wall -- neatly framed pictures of family, 
      friends... (Note:  No pictures from Garcia s military days). 

      Looking through to the KITCHEN, Jane sees someone open the 
        refrigerator door, blocking his view.  THUNK, the door 
      closes.  Just a glimpse of dark hair streaked with pink, 
      earbud cords, and a big bowl of cereal in a ring-studded 
      girl s hand.


      Jane enters to find emo/goth 16-year-old MADELEINE ( Maddy ) 
      GARCIA.  Black hair streaked with pink, black clothes, 
      disgusted with the world long before her father was killed.  
      She s at the sink pouring milk on her cereal.  Earbuds in, 
      fierce MUSIC SEEPING OUT.  Eyes closed.  Jane stands in the 
      doorway looking at her until Maddy finally opens her eyes.  
      Startled by Jane, she compensates by then gazing at him 
      blandly, without removing the headphones.  Shovels some 
      cereal in her mouth.

      Jane waves a small hello.  She doesn t respond.  He mimes 
      asking her to please take the phones off.  She does. 

                                  JANE
                    You must be Madeleine.

                                  MADDY
                    Maddy.  Whatever it is you re 
                    selling, pass.

      She puts the headphones back on, takes another bite.  Jane 
      starts silently mouthing words as though he were speaking.  
      After a while, Maddy realizes what he s doing and takes off 
      the phones again, angry now.

                                  MADDY (CONT D)
                    Funny.  What are you, a moron?  My 
                    dad just died. 

                                  JANE
                    Yes, my condolences.  It happens.  
                    You ll learn to live with it.  Not 
                    for a while, but in the end you 
                    will.  Mind if I sit down?

      He sits at the little kitchen table.  She s shocked by his 
      brutal yet optimistic honesty.  Got her attention now.

                    Your dad was in the National Guard

                    Hi, Maddy.  I m sorry for your 
                    loss.  This is for you.

      Maddy takes the bag, admires it.  For a moment not the surly 
      teen.

                    That s nice, Tommy.  Thanks.

                    I was watching TV.  Maddy was in 
                    her room.  Richard called to say he 
                    was leaving Mitch s, be home soon.  
                    He was doing stuff for the Avocado 
                    Parade?  Marquesa is the Avocado 
                    capital of the world, Rich has been 
                    float captain for six years running 
                    now.  Next thing, I heard a strange 
                    noise and then I saw a light out 
                    that window...
                          (hard to say)
                    It was the garage, burning.  And 
                    Rich inside, screaming.  That s 
                    what the noise was.  Rich 
                      screaming, trying to get out of the 
                    garage.

      From the kitchen door area, Maddy enters with Tommy.  Maddy 
      is sullen to her mother --

                                  TOMMY
                    Hello, Mrs. Garcia.  I brought corn 
                    chips.  Cool ranch.

                                  SUSAN
                    Thank you, sweetie.  Want some 
                    food?

                                  TOMMY
                    Can I have some chicken?

                                  SUSAN
                    Of course.  Whatever you like.  
                    Help yourself.

      Tommy takes a piece of chicken and shambles out, eating.  
      Lisbon looks questioning...

                                  SUSAN (CONT D)
                    Tommy does odd jobs around town.  
                      Challenged.  But ever so 
                      independent, bless him.

                      Challenged.  He s retarded, Mom.
                    Why can t you ever say the truth 
                    about anything?  Everything s a

      Maddy stomps out.

                                  SUSAN
                    Sorry.  You know, teenagers.

                                  JANE
                    You know why she s so angry?  She 
                    suspects your lover is responsible 
                    for killing her father. 

                                  SUSAN

                                  SUSAN
                    Maddy suspects no such thing.

      Lisbon eyes her, noting it s not a denial.

                                  JANE
                    That wasn t very convincing.  
                    D you want to try that again with 
                    more feeling? 

                                  SUSAN
                    You can t come in here and make 
                    wild accusations like this.

                                  JANE
                    You wouldn t look him in the eye, 
                    not once.  He kept trying to take 
                    your hand, but you wouldn t let 
                    him.  The air was practically 
                    buzzing with furtive shame and 
                    yearning.  Which tells me you re 
                    lovers, and suggests two 
                      possibilities... You and Piller 
                    killed your husband together and 
                    now you re remorseful.

                    No, I believe you.  You d have

                    killing him.  Second possibility.  
                    You have a horrible feeling maybe 
                    Piller did this thing to leave the

      convertible while he talks to Rigsby and Van Pelt.  Mitch has 
      a full beard and impossibly bushy shock of hair, dark glasses 
      and a gruff manner.  His arms are scarred with burns.  ZZ Top 
      roadie maybe.  Rigsby s a little impatient, making little

                    It was kind of late, around ten

      Rigsby and Van Pelt exchange a look, they re surprised too.  
      Just then Van Pelt s PHONE RINGS.  She picks up --

      Boxes around -- it s their makeshift HQ.  Rigsby, one arm

      bag.

                    at first.

      Rigsby obediently sits up, surprised at her authority.  Van 
      Pelt plunks herself beside him on the bed.  Rigsby s voice is 
      a little slurred by painkillers. 

                                  RIGSBY

      Lisbon opens a bottle of juice, sticks a straw in it and sets

                    suspect.

                    doctors found the date rape drug in

      Rigsby in bed, still woozy from the drugs, gazing lovingly at 
      Van Pelt, sitting nearby, reading The Purpose Driven Life.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Van Pelt?

                    Grace.  That s a lovely name.

                    I ve been wanting to say something 
                    to you for ages now, and I think 
                    now is the time because hey... why 
                    not.  I nearly died.  I love you, 
                    Grace, I totally love...

    Van Pelt puts her hands over her ears and makes a loud 
      humming noise so that she can t hear what he s saying.     
    She stops when she sees Rigsby has stopped talking and looks 
    at her puzzled.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    Are you okay?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Yes.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Why did you make that noise?

                                  VAN PELT
                    It s not that I don t like you.  I 
                    do.  But we work together.  There s 
                    rules.  If we get together, one of 
                    us has to leave the unit and I m 
                    junior so that would be me and I m 
                    sorry, but this job is so important 
                    and I...

      Rigsby s snores get loud enough to stop her carrying on.  She 
      picks up her book.  Throws it down, now distracted.  Cho 
      enters.

      Tommy lets in Jane and Lisbon.  A shy smile.  (Note:  He s no 
      longer wearing the t-shirt.)  When he sees Lisbon he s 
      smitten.

                    Looks like they re going to build 
                    out there.  Mrs. Garcia told my 
                    colleague you re looking after 
                    things for the owners.

      Tommy puffs with pride.

                                  TOMMY
                    I keep an eye out.  That s what Mr.

                    Tommy.

      As they re talking, Jane idly looks around.  Notes a PHOTO: 
      TOMMY and a bald man (DAVE MARTIN).  Happier times.

                    Jane?


      Cho and Rigsby question Machado.  


      Lisbon watches, with Jane.  She notes the tension in Jane s 
      shoulders. 


      Machado is nervous.  With effort, Rigsby plunks a metal jug 
      on the table.  Smiles grimly.

                    You know what temp human skin melts

                    Trey Piller s face, it just came 
                    off.

                                    MACHADO
                    I don t know where that stuff came 
                    from!  Someone s framing me.

                                    MACHADO
                    That was a misunderstanding.  I 
                    didn t know who you were.  I was 
                    defending myself.

                    Yes, we know about the aquifer,

                    Dave had.  So you set his house on

                    proof.  Someone needs revenge. 
                    Someone very smart and very 
                      determined.  That s why you re 
                    terrified and shooting at cops.  
                    Well, you should be terrified.  I 
                    hope you burn like a candle, you 
                    miserable sonofabitch. 


      Lisbon watches, chilled.


      Cho and Rigsby are also spooked.  Machado alarmed.

                                    MACHADO
                    You can t talk to me like that.    
                    I have rights.

                    Yes, you do.  Let this creep go.    
                    We have nothing on him.

      Jane exits.


      Lisbon joins Jane as he walks away from the interrogation 
      room.

                    Two notes here.  One, we have 
                    plenty on him.  Armed assault on 
                    Cho and Van Pelt, and a barn-ful of 
                    fire accelerant.

                                  JANE
                    The assault was self-defense and 
                    the accelerant was a plant.  But go 
                    ahead -- two?

                                  LISBON
                    Where do you get off giving orders 
                    in the first place?  I say who goes 
                    and who stays, not you.

                                  JANE
                    Fiery but calm.  Very good.  Try it 
                    with a forceful hand gesture.

                    I m serious.

                                  LISBON
                    He could be the killer, and even if 
                    he s not, we don t want the killer 
                    to get him.

                                  JANE
                    Yes we do.  Machado is our bait.  
                    Our tethered goat.

                                  LISBON
                    And too bad if the bait gets 
                    killed.

                                  JANE
                    Well, yes.  That s why you use 
                    goats and not babies or virgins. 

                                  LISBON
                    Machado isn t a goat.

                                  JANE
                    He deserves to suffer a little.

                                  JANE
                    Some people do.  Machado helped 
                    burn Dave Martin alive, out of 
                    greed.  He deserves it.

      Lisbon s shocked by his candid brutality.

                                  LISBON 
                    Jane, we re agents of the law.

                    That s not justice.  That s

                    We ve never discussed this before

                    I m going to cut him open and watch 
                    him die, slowly.  Like he did to my

                    about it.

                                  LISBON

      Machado tries hard to open the door, to no avail.  He hears a

      Eerie moonlight comes through the slats.  Now we see the 
      shadowy skeletons of old farming equipment, a THRESHER, 
      SCYTHE, other scary sharp stuff.  There are stairs to a 
      SECOND LEVEL... Where someone watches Ben.  The person 
      walks... Dust sprinkles down below... A DARK FIGURE appears 
      from the shadows, steps forward into a dim shaft of 
      moonlight.  We see a small part of his face -- it hints at 
      horrible burns, melted skin.  Speaks with a growling voice, 
        unrecognizable. 

                                  DISFIGURED MAN
                    Hello, Ben.

      Machado screams and aims his gun and PULLS THE TRIGGER, BUT 
      NOTHING HAPPENS.

      The Disfigured Man holds something up in a shaft of 
      moonlight.  A small piece of metal.  

                                  DISFIGURED MAN (CONT D)
                    You ll need your firing pin.

      The Disfigured Man tosses it at Machado s feet.  Holds up a 
      metal jug with a flourish and splashes liquid all over 
      Machado and the ground before him.  Machado s no coward, and 
      advances toward the stairs; the Disfigured Man holds up a 
      lighter, menacing.

                                  DISFIGURED MAN (CONT D)
                    Get back or I ll light you up. 

      Machado stops, backs up.

                                    MACHADO
                    Who are you?

                    You know who I am.  

                                    MACHADO
                    I have no freaking idea, man.

                                  DISFIGURED MAN
                    Sure you do, Ben.  You tried to 
                    kill me. 

                                    MACHADO
                    No.  Oh no.  That s not possible. 

                                  DISFIGURED MAN
                    Oh yes, Ben, it is.  It s me.

                                    MACHADO
                    Dave?

      The Disfigured Man chuckles softly.  Terrified now, Machado 
      runs back to the locked door.  Tries to open it. 

                                    MACHADO (CONT D)
                    Help!  HELP!


      Machado bangs on the door...

                                    MACHADO
                    Help!  Help me!

                                  DISFIGURED MAN
                    Forget it, Ben.  Nobody can hear 
                    you.  You re going to die alone, 
                    screaming in agony.  Like I did.

      Machado groans in terror.

                                    MACHADO
                    This is a dream.  It s not 
                      happening.

                                  DISFIGURED MAN
                    Why did you kill me, Ben?  We were 
                    friends.  If you needed money so 
                    bad, you should have told me.  
                    I would have helped you.

                                    MACHADO
                    I did tell you!  All of us, we 
                    begged you.  This is your own 
                    fault.  You selfish bastard!  We 
                    didn t want to kill you.  But you 
                    wouldn t see sense.
                          (beat)
                    I m sorry.  I m sorry.

       Dave  finally reveals his visage -- the horrible, ruined 
      face.  Machado recoils in horror.  A beat.   Dave  yanks off 
      his mask, steps into the shaft of moonlight.  It s Jane.  
      Very pleased with himself.

                                  JANE
                    See how much better you feel now?  
                    I forgive you.  Can t speak for 
                    Dave Martin, though.

    He clicks off a little digital recorder.  

                                  MACHADO
                    You sonofabitch.    

      Machado looks around, picks up a BIG AXE and advances on 
      Jane...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     44.

      Jane backs up to the door.   

                                    MACHADO
                    I killed an intruder in my barn, 
                    how was I to know it was a cop?  
                    If that s what you are.  What are

      No reply.  Jane rattles the door.

                    They re right outside.

      Machado raises the blade.

                    Wait!  You re forgetting something!

      Machado curses, lowers the machete.

      Jane goes to a crack between boards, peers through a slat --

      JANE S POV

      A figure tosses a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL right at him.

      as he throws himself behind a thresher just as a SPLASH OF 
      FIRE pops into the barn.  The light from the flames outside 
      licks at the windows.  Smoke starts seeping in.

                                    MACHADO

                    Oh, dear.

      Jane goes to a crack in the wall, calling out to the killer --

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Open the door!  

      No answer.  A window IMPLODES from the heat, shattering above 
      Jane s head.

                                    MACHADO
                    We re going to die, you son of a 
                    bitch!  What have you done?

      The two race up the stairs to a rear door.  Machado stumbles, 
      falls back.  Jane grabs his arm and thrusts him to the door.    
      Tries it.  Won t open.  Slams his body against it.  No luck.  
      A wall of flame ROARS in like a train...


      Tommy Olds sits in the hot seat, Cho enters and sits down

                                  TOMMY
                    I like whales.  They eat squids.

                                  JANE
                    Looking back now, I should have 
                    known it was you the first time I 
                    saw you. 


      FLASHBACK


      Tommy speaking to Susan.  FIND his T-SHIRT, then find Tommy s 
      smiling face.  But now it looks sinister.

      END FLASHBACK


      RESUME SCENE as Jane eyes Tommy closely.

                                  JANE
                    Only an idiot would wear a t-shirt 
                    like that to a house in mourning.  
                    An idiot, or a daring killer with a 
                    warped sense of humor.

      A faint smile from Tommy.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You re going down for this.  
                    Why not go down as your true self?    
                    You ve pulled off something 
                    amazing.  You should be proud. 
                    In a way.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Is that root beer coming?

                                  JANE
                    I can see you.  Come out and talk 
                    to me, Thomas.  There s no use 
                    hiding any more.

      Tommy seems to straighten and expand into a self-assured, 
      clever, though deeply twisted young man.  He speaks with 
      precision.

                                  TOMMY
                    What do you want to know?

                                  JANE
                    Hello.  Nice to meet you.


      Lisbon and Rigsby react to the transformation...        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     51.



      On Jane...

                                  JANE
                    I m curious.  Are there two of you 
                    or is Tommy just an act you put on? 

                                  TOMMY
                    Please, I m not a mental case. 


                                  RIGSBY
                    Oh, yes you are, dude.


                                  TOMMY
                    Tommy s an act.  A performance. 

                                  JANE
                    That you never turn off.  

                                  TOMMY
                    He amuses me.  He protects me.  
                    When I was 18, I jacked a car.  Got 
                    caught.  But when I pulled the 
                    Tommy act the cops let me go.  I ve 
                    gotten much better since then, of 
                    course.

                                  JANE
                    Good enough to avenge Dave Martin s 
                    death.

                                  TOMMY
                    Three months ago, the company 
                    finally got a permit to exploit the 
                    aquifer.  All that money.  I put 
                    things together, realized what 
                    they d done to Dave.  

      Jane hands Tommy the book.

                                  TOMMY (CONT D)
                    Thanks.

                                  JANE 
                      I confess, I never have gotten to 
                    the end.  I know Ahab dies though, 
                    doesn t he?

                                  TOMMY
                    Yes.  But so does the whale.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     52.

      CONTINUED:4343

                                  JANE
                    Does he?  My point is, revenge 
                    never comes cheap.  

                                  TOMMY 
                    Spare me your moralizing.  I know 
                    what revenge costs.  It s worth the 
                    price.  David Martin had many 
                    flaws, no doubt, but he was my 
                    friend.  My friend.  Those animals 
                    deserve what they got.  It was 
                    justice. 

      Jane takes a beat, throws a sardonic look to Lisbon in the 
      observation room. 

                                  JANE
                    You admit killing Rich Garcia and 
                    trying to kill Trey Piller. 

                                  TOMMY
                    I watched them scream and writhe in 
                    agony and it was beautiful.  It was 
                      redemptive and beautiful.
                          (off Jane; contemptuous)
                    You wouldn t understand.  

      A beat.  Jane eyes Tommy sadly, stands.

                                  JANE
                    Someone will be along in a moment 
                    to charge you formally.  Good luck, 
                    Thomas.

                                  TOMMY
                    Would you do one thing for me?  

                                  JANE
                    You can ask.

                                  TOMMY
                    Tell Maddy Garcia I m sorry I hurt 
                    her. 

      Jane nods.  Exits.


      Jane and Lisbon talking with Maddy and Susan.  Mother and 
      daughter are barely speaking to each other.

                                  MADDY
                    Sorry?  He s sorry?  You tell him, 
                    if he ever gets out of jail I m 
                    going to set him on fire, see how 
                    he likes it.

                                  SUSAN
                    Maddy.  

                                  MADDY
                    I am! 

                                  SUSAN
                    Your father wasn t, he didn t...

                                  MADDY
                    Don t you talk about him!  You have 
                    no right!  No right!    

                                  JANE
                    Your father killed a man.  That s why 
                    he died.  You need to own that.  Tommy 
                    only did what you re now planning to 
                    do to him.  Revenge is a poison.  
                    Revenge is for fools and madmen.

      That gives Maddy pause.

                                  MADDY
                    I don t care.

                                  JANE
                    Yes, you do.  

      Lisbon eyes her watch, then Jane.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    We have to go.  Do me one favor.  
                    Will you both do me one favor?

      They both nod warily.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                          (beckoning)
                    Come here. 

      Mother and daughter come close.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     54.

      CONTINUED:4545

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I want you to give each other a 
                    hug.  As if you loved each other. 
                    Please.  For me.

      He physically pulls them together.  They reluctantly hug.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Now hold that pose until we leave.  
                    It ll help Lisbon and me feel like 
                    we ve made a difference, you know? 

                                  LISBON
                    Goodbye.

      Jane and Lisbon exit.  But Susan and Maddy don t separate.   
      We hold as they hug tighter.
