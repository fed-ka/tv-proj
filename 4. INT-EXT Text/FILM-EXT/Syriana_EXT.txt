The minarets of Shi'a mosques dot the skyline. The sun

A GROUP of bearded, turbanned MEN in white robes carrying
Korans walk down an empty street.
As the religious men pass a nondescript metal door, a

Bob walks, happy. Dour MEN at cafe tables miss nothing.
The HIGH POV down to the street. The Amiris exit the

Behind Bob, in the distance, the Amiris get into the car.
Bob glances up at the roof and NODS ONCE, continuing to

Oilmen cluster around makeshift wooden tables. BENNETT
HOLIDAY, 35, African-American, a clean-cut lawyer, maybe
horn rims, starting to grey, sits at a table with RUSSIAN
OIL EXECS. The LEADER eats ribs with tiny teeth.
BENNETT
Are you a director or executive of
this company?
The leader gnaws on a bone. Bennett points down to a mess
of contracts and legal papers in front of him.
BENNETT (CONT'D)
Is this your fax number?
The leader speaks rapidly in RUSSIAN. Bennett is baffled.
Finally, an UNDERLING translates.

BENNETT
Ask him if he's been receiving

Is this a number to reach you?
Again, the leader speaks in rapid Russian.
UNDERLING
He says, the weather in Siberia is
very cold!
BENNETT
I'm asking you about this payment.
Who is this person on the account?
Bennett notices a Russian, OSKAR WERNER-TYPE, wearing
THICK-FRAMED GLASSES, smoking and staring at him. Another
RUSSIAN glances at the paperwork.
UNDERLING
Bank is no more.
BENNETT
I know bank is no more. I'm trying
to find out where the assets went.
The Russians nod to the MUSIC coming from the poles. Now
the leader speaks in surprisingly good English.
LEADER
This is marching music composed
for Stalin. Inspiring for workers.
The leader smiles at Bennett. It's a scary smile. The
THICK-FRAMED GLASSES GUY is still staring.
LEADER (CONT'D)
The investment dollar that matters
is one that has army behind it. We

Scram? What do you mean, scram?
ANGLE ON: The engineer pointing toward the exit of the

CHINESE ENGINEER

Look at them standing there. Like
blue cows. Shit. Get them moving.
Wasim and Saleem cross the desert near the LNG facility.
SALEEM
The Chinese are smart people, but
such bad drivers. They should not
be allowed even to wash cars.
Wasim doesn't say anything. They walk in silence. Then --
SALEEM (CONT'D)
When I was your age, in Pakistan,
there was always in the distance--
SALEEM/WASIM (SIMUL)
Snow covered mountains.
SALEEM
That's right. Three hours away,

Wasim just looks at his dad who puts his arm around him.
The refinery and power lines shimmer behind them.
Massive POWER LINES drape from steel pyramid to steel
pyramid. A GROUP of TEENAGERS, including Wasim and
FAROOQ, 16, a self-styled leader, drink home-fermented
alcohol from a Styrofoam cup. They wear jeans, T-shirts,
caps. Ragged, unbathed, they're wasted.
Farooq takes a gulp, makes a face, swallows, SHOUTS --
FAROOQ
Ow, ow, ow, ahhh --
He throws up. The KIDS laugh. He comes up composed --
FAROOQ (CONT'D)
An announcement. An announcement.
If man is made in God's image,
then God is deeply messed up.
Farooq shoves the cup at Wasim. He tries to push it away.
FAROOQ (CONT'D)
You afraid? Afraid of the buzz?
WASIM
I'm afraid of your breath.
Wasim points at a silent kid hanging back from the group.

Hakim looks to his brother, then lifts up his shirt.
There is a recent scar where a kidney would be.
FAROOQ
You can drink with one. You don't

Finally, Hakim sips and holds his side. The boys' cheers

Bennett exits a cab, walks up the steps with an overnight

DANNY DALTON (V.0.)
I hear phrases thrown around like
"the corrupting influence of

money was spent on the syndication

election.
Bennett just walks past him to open the door.
Bryan and Julie and the kids arrive at the manicured
entrance of a vast, impressive estate, their rental wagon
anomalous among Bentleys and Rolls.
An Arab valet opens Julie's door. The kids are excited.
A geometric sculpture garden. Giacomettis and Henry
Moores. A TV monitor plays video of gardens and flowers.
GUESTS cluster together. You could almost tag labels on
them: arms dealer, Ambassador, Minister of Trees.
Bryan and Julie and the kids wander into the party.
BRYAN
.I'm probably the tenth guy this
month to pitch something like
this. It's like the Godfather.
Emir, I come to you on this
special day. Vincent is riding
motorcycles through Cambodia,
through land-mines. Some charity
thing.
JULIE
That's guilt not charity. He's
Catholic and can't view himself as
a shallow model f.u.c.k.e.r, which
he is. And when war breaks out in
some energy producing country,
he's the first one into work.

bearded, overweight, sitting in front of greenery, his
TWO SONS behind him, addresses his party guests.
EMIR (ON TV)
It is my pleasure to personally
welcome each of you to the Casa De
Las Palmas, our oasis of palms in
the south of Spain.
Bryan and Julie watch Max tentatively approach the pool.
Nearby, Riley has introduced himself to an Arab family.
JULIE
Arabs are very family oriented, as
a people. Is that racist?
Max, a book-oriented, rather than water-oriented, child
is afraid to jump in.
BRYAN
(WATCHING-MAX)
Not if what you're saying is
positive.
A bigger BOY fakes like he might push him in. Bryan
starts to his feet --
JULIE
Don't. Let him work this out. It's
important for his autonomy.
Max finds his courage, jumps, and disappears beneath the
surface, then bobs up happily. Julie smiles.
BRYAN
Hedge strategies are tough for
these guys. Oil goes up the people
wonder why those extra billions
aren't in the treasury. Prices go
down, no one's thanking them for
saving a few bucks.
Julie looks at her husband to determine whether he's
testing his "pitch" or in need of encouragement.
JULIE
Make a game of it. Pretend they're
six year-olds and you have to get
them to eat carrots and all they
want is dessert. Make it about
good parenting.
CHILDREN SCREAM, shouting, playing tag in the crepuscular
light beside the dark pool. Max is among the children.

The SOUND of ELECTRICITY. We push toward a darkened pool
light. The cover is cracked and the light is filled with
water. Closer. Blue light arcs inside the cover. The
SOUND of ELECTRICITY is LOUDER.

OLDER KID (CONT'D)
You jump in and count one, two,
three, then we all try to get to

Max stares at the dark water. It's not inviting. Finally,
he jumps.
He hits the water and goes rigid, almost skittering
across the surface, flopping uncontrollably.
Bryan walks back across the lawn when SCREAMS come from
the pool area ahead. Bryan hurries, then runs.
The VOLTAGE is audible as Max rolls onto his back,
floating lifelessly. SECURITY prevent people from diving
in. A bystander yells --
BYSTANDER
Cut the power! Cut the power!
Bryan enters the area. He sees Julie being restrained.
And a body in the water.
As the estate goes dark, Bryan dives and holds Max,
wading to the side with the lifeless body.

reflection in a shard of glass of a boarded-up window.

WASIM

You don't have to pay me. Let me

For a moment it seems like this offer may win the day.
ABU KHALIFA
I'm sorry. I already have a long
list for that, too.

And if you want to work in this

Wasim tries and fails to hide his disappointment.

Saleem looks around, sees if anyone was listening, then
takes the old man's arm.
SALEEM
You don't want to talk here.
Suddenly, a POLICEMAN shoves Saleem from behind. Saleem
turns to the officer, already apologizing, but Wasim
steps between them. The cop pushes Wasim with his baton.
POLICEMAN
Tough guy? Is that right, tough
guy? What's your name, tough guy?
Wasim doesn't say anything. Yunus watches his father and
brother. The cop pokes Wasim again with the stick --

The policeman swiftly brings his club down on Wasim's
head, dropping him to his knees. other POLICEMEN close.

Here is your route. Overland.
Through Iran. You commoditize it,
you control it, you take it right

four. I think that's a pretty good

MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA
That is good because fornication

FAROOQ

Legitimized gangsterism on a

DANNY D. (CONT'D)
Corruption charges. Corruption?
Corruption ain't nothing more than

doctor's check-ups and worried

We use one quarter of the oil in
