The wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly
through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack
lights of a police car coming toward us. It drops into a
dip, reappears almost immediately, hurtling down the center
of the deserted highway. It gets closer and closer until the
lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us.
The squad car skids off the asphalt in front of the sign and
starts up a rutted dirt road. The sign tells us we are headed
for 'Pinewood Estates,' a housing development financed by
the Farmers Bank of Wisconsin.
Using only its parking lights, the police car creeps up the
dirt road between skeletons of unfinished houses.
The police car comes around a curve on the hillside and stops.
Above them on the next hill, a necklace of embers from a
grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog. The
men get out of the car.
BENNY
(loud whisper)
There!! Up on the hill!!
The officer steps forward for a better look. Benny hangs on
his shoulder.
BENNY
Right in line with that burning tree.
OFFICER
I don't see anything.
BENNY
It's there. The fog's thicker now,
but it's there. What do you think
started those fires?
The officer strains to see through the fog.
OFFICER
Benny, there's nothing there.
BENNY
There is. They came out of the belly
of the ship and then went to the
first terrace and flew down into the
houses.
OFFICER
Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
The second officer is peering intently at something down
among the houses.
OFFICER
You hear that, Mike? Now he's telling
us...
MIKE (SECOND OFFICER)
What's that?
Benny and the officer look to where Mike is pointing. What
appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among
the houses below them. Further into the track another beam
of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise
stationary.
BENNY
What did I tell you?
OFFICER
Probably kids.
One of the lights rises over a house and settles on the other
side.
MIKE
(not convinced)
Probably...
A light shines directly into our eyes. As it swings away
from us we realize that it was the searchlight on the police
car which is idling along the dirt road with its running
lights off. The fire on the hill gives the fog down here a
red tint.
The police car passes a road perpendicular to the one it is
on. A couple of houses down that road a faint glow spills
over the sides of an industrial dumpster. As we watch we
hear an eerie high pitched whistle, a shaft of light slowly
rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between the
houses.
The police car is parked in the middle of the dirt road.
Benny and the officers are intent on a light that reaches
them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in the
direction of the fire on the hill. The police searchlight
swings onto the house.
OFFICER
(over outside speakers)
This is the police. Identify
yourselves.
It is deathly silent.
Carrying a shotgun the officer motions Benny and Mike to fan
out on either side of him and, guns drawn, they cut across
the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light.
The fog quickly isolates them, heightening their fear. Each
man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing
and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground. They drift in
and out of visual contact with each other.
Benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle
sweep by on his left. He turns slowly to see, through the
ribs of an unfinished house, a shaft of the white light
pointing at a cement mixer.
BENNY
(to the officers, his
voice cracking)
There's one over here...
The brilliant light swings toward him. Benny, his hands
trembling, raises the gun.
BENNY
Stop!! Police!!
The light fixes on Benny and terrified he shakes off a couple
shots. The light goes out immediately.
MIKE
(in Benny's direction)
What happened?
BENNY
I think I shot one.
MIKE
Jesus, Benny. What are you doing?
The men strain to see something through the silent fog.
OFFICER
You see anything, Mike?
Before Mike can answer, a strange percussive clicking sound
is heard. He pumps a shell in the chamber of his shotgun and
swallowing his fear moves toward the voices. They stop.
OFFICER
This is the police. Identify
yourselves.
Benny, his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of
him, inches around the house looking for what he shot at. He
gets to where it should be but it's not there. His light
searches the area. There is nothing but a stack of lumber.
Shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner.
Nothing. Benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again.
BENNY
(shouts to the officers)
You wanna give me some help over
here.
MIKE
Okay...
Benny continues around the house. He flashes his light into
a doorway. There is nothing but framing. When he moves on, a
figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then
raises its arms. With a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing
off its wrist into its hands.
At the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and stops.
The high pitched whistle starts behind him. He stumbles around
to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. Benny
screams in terror and fires at it. The light swerves and a
laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears Benny's chest
and knocks him to the ground in pain. Holding his shoulder
he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the
houses.
The officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the
air, then crashes to the earth.
OFFICER
Mike, call for back-up.
(shouting)
Benny, you all right?
BENNY
I don't think so...
(clutching his shoulder)
OFFICER
(waving the beam of
his flashlight, shouts)
Benny, this is me. I'm going to take
a look.
Benny's beam flashes back.
BENNY
Don't leave me. I'm coming.
The two men begin to trot toward the light. It swings wildly
around and, accompanied by the high-pitched whistle, starts
to stagger back up the hill. Benny and the officer break
into a run. They are on their way up the hill when the light
in front of them crashes to the earth. It rolls over and
lays still, the beam shooting straight up into the air. Benny
and the officer slow their pursuit, terrified of what they
might find. Suddenly a high-pitched whistle is bearing down
on them from behind. Before they can turn a light rockets
over their heads. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate.
As they follow its flight, they see lights beginning to ripple
to life across the skin of a saucer-shaped spacecraft resting
at the edge of the forest on top of the hill. With a rumble
the hill begins to vibrate. Frightened, the officers stop.
From the road Benny and the officer watch as the humanoid
figure that just blasted over them flies between the trees
and into the white light emitting from the underbelly of the
spacecraft. The noise from the ship's power plant is deafening
as it begins to rise above the trees.
With Mike at the wheel the police car, its rack lights
flashing, fishtails up the dirt road and slides sideways to
a bone-jarring stop next to Benny and the officer. As they
jump out of the way they find themselves facing into the
super white beam of the figure that was in the house. They
are between it and the ship. At the angle that it is coming
up the hill, the light looks like it is heading directly for
them. This is too much for the officer and in terror he raises
his shotgun and fires wildly at it. The figure veers off and
disappears into the fog.
With an awesome roar the spacecraft reaches escape velocity
and hurtles into the night sky. The concussion waves knock
Benny and the officers off their feet.
The escaped figure's light comes out of the fog at tree
height. We hear the high-pitched whistle of its rockets. A
burst of percussive language comes from behind the faceplate.
SUBTITLE
Lander four to Mapmaker Wind. Fix
position for rescue. Repeat. Fix
position for rescue.
The fires on the hillside have been renewed. Shaking, Benny
and the officer rise to their feet and start toward the light
shafting straight up from the figure lying on the hillside.
The only sound is police chatter coming out of the radio in
the open squad car.
An 18-wheeler with a load of logs lumbers past us.
The escaped figure banks around a blind corner.
The figure bounces off the jack-knifing truck and like a
wounded bird tumbles through the air into the trees. With
the light spinning crazily, it plunges through the boughs
and smashes face first into the mud at the bottom of an
embankment. The strip lights on the sides of its helmet go
out.
The driver and his partner, standing in the shafts of the
high beams, are peering into the woods.
PARTNER
What the hell was it anyway?
DRIVER
Damned if I know.
The figure thrashes over on its back and tries to close a
shoulder-to-hip tear in its life-support suit. By the faint
identification light that flickers on and off inside its
helmet, we see a MAN FROM THE STARS. His skin is translucent
coral. He is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his and
threatens to suffocate him.
Under his translucent skin a maze of veins and arteries extend
from a white mass that sits in the upper half of his head.
He is hairless. Underneath a graceful fore-head, transparent
eyelids droop over black pupilless eyes. The thin lips that
delineate his mouth are chalk-white.
He tries to clutch the edges of the tear together but is too
weak. His hands drop limply from the suit, allowing the rent
to gape open and reveal the translucent body underneath.
PARTNER (V.O.)
Come on. I'm getting wet.
DRIVER (V.O.)
It musta been a bird.
PARTNER (V.O.)
How about if I drive now?
Behind the faceplate a piece of white light breaks off from
the shining mass in the STAR MAN'S head and moves down his
neck. Through the hole in the suit we see it arrive at the
top of his single lung. The white light spreads throughout
the organ like a phosphorescent tide. The STAR MAN lapses
into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away.
A man in a white contamination suit is helping Benny and the
two officers into the Air Force helicopter. The three men
are glassy-eyed and wrapped in blankets. Benny has a bandage
across his chest. They look up at Shermin's descending
helicopter. They are still looking at it when they disappear
inside.
Shermin's unmarked S65 settles on the clearing. The nose
door is open and Shermin, carrying the hood of his
contamination suit, comes down the ladder. A tall homespun
man, also in a hoodless contamination suit, steps forward to
greet him.
MAN
(around a cigarette)
Major Aaron Bell...
SHERMIN
Marc Shermin, National Security
Agency.
Shermin takes a moment to look over at the tent, the green
hillside and the forest beyond. It is pastoral in the soft
light of dawn.
SHERMIN
This has always been my favorite
time of day.
MAJOR BELL (MAN)
Very beautiful country up here...
SHERMIN
Any signs of biological contamination,
excessive radiation, anything like
that?
MAJOR BELL
Not on the landscape. We're trying
to get a tube under the faceplate
for a reading on possible deadly
lifeforms but it's hard going.
SHERMIN
Can you see under the faceplate?
MAJOR BELL
No.
Bell's hands shake as he lights a new cigarette off the one
in his mouth.
SHERMIN
There's a good chance you could be
wrong about this thing then...
MAJOR BELL
Wait'll you see it.
He throws away the cigarette and begins to put on his
contamination hood. Shermin follows as they start for the
tent.
MAJOR BELL
We had a flight of F16's play tag
with the spaceship over Michigan for
an hour. Then it shot straight up
and disappeared.
SHERMIN
Was there visual contact?
MAJOR BELL
No, sir. Radar.
SHERMIN
It could have been anything.
Hooded, Bell and Shermin make their way past three suited
scientists examining the landscape with geiger counters and
other sensing instruments. With the coming of dawn and Bell's
handlight we can clearly see the pod indentations and the
huge black glass cup of earth that was fused by the energy
blasting out of the spaceship's power plant.
MAJOR BELL
After I called in, I had a chance to
sit down with the three locals. They
swear there's another one that didn't
make the ship... It might be alive.
SHERMIN
People have made mistakes in these
situations before.
MAJOR BELL
I've been investigating sightings
for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin.
This one's real. We have a dead extra-
terrestrial in that tent and another
one in the area that might be alive.
We've been visited. It's finally
happened and the sooner Washington
accepts that and starts figuring out
how we're going to deal with these
beings, the better off we're going
to be.
It is still raining.
The STAR MAN stirs and awakens with a start. He parts the
tear in his suit and looks at his lung through his translucent
body. It has changed in color from brown to a rich yellow
ocher. He takes several deep breaths of our atmosphere and
his lung expands and contracts easily. He conducts a quick
inventory of his damaged spacesuit, then struggles to his
knees and stands up.
The STAR MAN is standing. We hear the sounds of his percussive
language coming from behind his mirrored faceplate.
STAR MAN
(subtitle)
Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?
His answer is nothing but the low buzz. He taps a series of
buttons on his chest panel and speaks again.
STAR MAN
Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?
Again the buzz.
STAR MAN
Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?
The buzz continues. He is very still for a moment. Then he
presses the palms of his hands together, prayer fashion, and
concentrates. When he pulls them apart, a blue force field
pulses between them. He stops at shoulder width. A solarized
aerial view of the United States forms on the force field. A
green dot appears in the area of western Wisconsin, a red
dot in the area of Death Valley, California. He drops his
hands to his lap and sits very still. The solarized compass
remains floating in the air in front of him. After a long
moment he reaches up and squeezes it into a ball that
disappears when his palms come together.
The lift off of Shermin's helicopter reveals contamination --
suited scientists slipping the dead extraterrestrial's coffin
into the Air Force helicopter.
The STAR MAN, still in his life-support suit, looks surreal
in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. The morning
rain has gone. A hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to
a stand of alders that border the forest. Through the leaves
he can see a highway entering the sprawl of Eau Claire,
Wisconsin. The cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are
of particular interest to him.
When he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get
a better look at the town. On the wind he can hear shouts
from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a
grade school off to his right. Suburban houses have begun to
snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on.
Keeping to the tree line well above them he continues his
search for an avenue of escape. His head swivels to watch a
Volvo station wagon come down the street. It swings into the
driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a
Mustang Hatchback. The back door opens and JENNY HAYDN, a
pretty girl in her mid-twenties, gets out carrying a crudely
lettered be-ribboned sign 'Welcome Back, Mrs. Haydn.' Female
voices drift up to the STAR MAN from inside the car.
VOICES
It was great to have you back... The
kids loved it. We loved it. You're
doing the right thing...
JENNY
I hope so... We'll see... See you
tomorrow... Bye. Bye.
VOICE
(as the Volvo backs
out of the driveway)
Remember you're required to have a
lesson planned tomorrow.
Jenny laughs and waves. With the Volvo moving away up the
street Jenny picks her newspaper off her walk and goes into
the house.
The STAR MAN presses on through the trees. He hears a light
plane overhead. He stops and watches until the branches cut
off his view. A path between two logs leads him to the tip
of a promontory. From behind the cedars growing there, he
sits and looks down on the center of Eau Claire.
Arm in arm, a YOUNG COUPLE meander through the trees. The
boy has a blanket over his shoulder and the girl's hair is
disheveled. Without seeing him, they walk past the STAR MAN
crouched in a thicket of small pines. After they've gone by,
he straightens up and watches them walk down toward the
highway.
The sun is setting over suburban Eau Claire. The colors are
reflected in the STAR MAN's faceplate as he watches Jenny
push a hand mower over her back yard.
He takes a dusty gray marble out of a leg pocket and while
Jenny finishes the lawn he rolls it between his gloves. It
turns a glowing gold as it grows in size. When it reaches
the dimensions of a baseball, he brings it close to his
faceplate and speaks into it.
STAR MAN
(subtitles)
Iron channel message. Suit and rockets
destroyed. Radical mixture of this
atmosphere and ours in helmet allowed
chemo-ion response time to adapt my
body to this air. Am going to attempt
extreme transformation in order to
cross land mass to site of our
practice landings. If transformation
is not fatal, second message ball by
next darkness.
He opens his hands and the ball rises quickly into the sky.
Jenny is dumping the grass clippings into a garbage can at
the side of the house when the sudden motion of the message
ball catches her eye and she watches it quizzically until it
disappears.
We are on the belly of Shermin's helicopter looking at the
tree tops rushing underneath.
We are looking through the living room window at Jenny
watching television while she irons the clothes she plans to
wear to work tomorrow. The STAR MAN stands just outside the
light-fall in the back yard watching her.
A commercial interrupts the old movie with a jolly fat MAN
in a jumpsuit touting his used cars. The two words 'We
have...' are repeated constantly during the pitch. 'We have
automatics... We have sticks... We have colors... We have
financing...' ...
We move in close on the STAR MAN'S faceplate.
STAR MAN
(practicing the human
sound)
Wehave...
(more precise)
Wehave...
(well-formed)
Wehave...
Jenny finishes the skirt, unplugs the iron, picks up the
clothes, shuts off the television, the light and heads
upstairs. Half way up she stops.
JENNY
(faint through the
glass)
Damn!
She turns around and looks down indecisively, then hurries
upstairs. A light goes on in the bedroom. The STAR MAN backs
away to look up at it. He can't see anything. He is on his
way to try and get in the side door when Jenny comes clumping
down the stairs in an old sweatshirt and pulling on a pair
of jeans. She disappears into the kitchen. Without warning
the door ahead of him is swung open and Jenny rushes out.
The STAR MAN barely has time to step into the shadows. Jenny
grabs the handle of one of the garbage cans lined against
the house and drags it down to the street. When she comes
back for the second one we see that the STAR MAN is no longer
in the shadows.
The Mustang is backing out of the driveway with Jenny behind
the wheel and the STAR MAN perched nervously on the passenger
seat.
The Mustang cruises through the industrial section of Eau
Claire.
We COME DOWN FROM a red light TO FIND the Mustang stopped
behind the limit line.
JENNY (V.O.)
Which way?
STAR MAN (V.O.)
That way.
The light changes and the car proceeds straight across the
intersection.
STAR MAN (V.O.)
Good.
The Mustang skids sideways across the center line. The
oncoming van jams on its brakes and swerves to its left.
Locked in a skid, it drifts toward the Mustang.
A tall, raw-boned MAN in his late twenties storms around the
front of his van.
MAN
You stupid son of a bitch!!
He kicks the Mustang.
JENNY
(screaming)
Help me!!
MAN
You could have killed us both!!
JENNY
(battling to maintain
her grip on the door
frame)
He's kidnapping me!!!
The Man bends down to look at the struggle.
MAN
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
JENNY
Call the police!!
MAN
(not sure he wants to
get involved)
Hey buddy... let her go...
The STAR MAN increases his efforts and Jenny loses her grip
on one of the door frames.
JENNY
Help me!!!
MAN
(grabbing her other
arm)
Hey, she doesn't want to go with
you. Come on.
The STAR MAN frees his right hand and blindly searches the
floor for the gun. He comes up with it and, shoving the barrel
in the Man's face, barks a harsh command in his language.
The Man freezes and Jenny stops struggling. It's suddenly
very quiet on the street.
MAN
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My
mistake... I'm sorry...
JENNY
He doesn't understand... just walk
away...
The STAR MAN claps a hand over her mouth.
MAN
I promise I'm not going to tell
anybody about this... None of my
business... I'm going to move now,
okay...
(takes a step to one
side)
You guys want to fight, that's up to
you...
(takes another step)
I'm leaving now... I won't say a
word...
He keeps his eyes on the STAR MAN until he reaches the back
of the Mustang, steals a quick look at the license plate,
then blots for his van. The STAR MAN takes his hand off
Jenny's mouth and slams her back into her seat. Uttering an
expletive in his language he points the gun in her face and
keeping it there indicates the red dot on the satel compass
floating undisturbed above the dashboard.
STAR MAN
Go.
The Mustang moves back into the correct lane and continues
on.
Shermin's helicopter is taking on fuel from an Army tanker
truck. The pilot and co-pilot are catching forty winks on
the grass next to the old bunkhouse.
With a rush the helicopter rises out of the trees and thunders
away.
There are Eau Claire police cars on the street. Shermin is
out back watching Bell pick his way down the hill. Through
the windows we see uniformed policemen in the living room.
MAJOR BELL
(slides the last few
feet down the hill)
Nothing up there... The grass is
matted down in a few places, but
that could have been anything.
SHERMIN
It was the husband. The police finally
got a hold of the witness at work
and showed him a picture of the woman.
The man standing next to her in the picture was her husband
and the witness said that was the guy who kidnapped her.
MAJOR BELL
It's the right area, that's for sure.
Throughout the above, Shermin has noticed a WOMAN in the
house next door peeping through her blinds at the activity
around Jenny's. She closes the drapes suddenly when she
realizes Shermin has spotted her.
SHERMIN
Why the clicking language though?
Shermin knocks and waits on the steps with Bell for someone
to answer. We hear a chain being pulled off and the door is
opened by a freckled-face MAN in his late thirties, dressed
in a business suit and wiping the traces of a breakfast from
around his mouth.
SHERMIN
Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's
been some trouble next door. I'd
like to ask you a few questions.
MAN
What happened?
SHERMIN
There's a possibility that Mrs.
Haydn's been kidnapped. We're hoping
you might have seen something.
A WOMAN in a robe opens the door a little wider to include
herself in the conversation. She is as freckled as the man
and about the same age.
WOMAN
(to the Man)
I told you...
MAN
Judy, that's stupid.
WOMAN
Well, maybe these men won't think
so. We were asleep when a helicopter
woke me up. It made me so nervous I
went into the kitchen for something
to eat. I happened to look out the
window and there was Scott Haydn
with this green thing draped over
his arm pulling Jenny down the walk
to the car.
MAN
You know that's impossible!
WOMAN
I know what I saw. I've seen him
enough times.
MAN
(giving up on his
wife and addressing
Shermin and Lyman)
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about
three months ago. We went to the
funeral.
Shermin and Bell exchange a glance.
Jenny's Mustang is sailing through the beautiful Wisconsin
farmland.
STAR MAN (V.O.)
R-r-S-s...
Jenny's Mustang moves along through the traffic.
JENNY
(V.O.)
Gas.
The Mustang spurts forward a few yards.
JENNY
(V.O.)
No gas.
It staggers down to a crawl.
JENNY
(V.O.)
Gas.
The car leaps forward again.
JENNY
(V.O.)
No gas.
It drops back to a crawl.
The Mustang comes up the off-ramp toward the pumps.
Jenny gets out of the car. When she straightens up, she finds
the STAR MAN staring at her over the roof. She slams the
door and strides rapidly in the direction of the ladies'
room. Stuffing the green pouch in his pocket, the STAR MAN
trots after her.
JENNY
(wheels on him as he
catches up)
Go back to the car.
The STAR MAN looks at her but doesn't move. Jenny snarls in
frustration, then with the STAR MAN on her heels, stalks to
the ladies' room and throws open the door.
Jenny points to the sign on the next door.
JENNY
Men. You go in here.
She cracks the door for him.
JENNY
Come on.
He takes the door from her and pushes it open for a look
inside. Jenny ducks into the ladies' room. He is confused
for a moment then takes a long look at the men's room. It
means nothing to him. He backs out and tries the ladies'
room. It is locked. Not knowing what to do, the STAR MAN
stands uncomfortably in front of the door, then like a child
waiting for his mother, he sits on the curb. He watches the
Attendant lift the Mustang's hood and reach in for the
dipstick. The numbers on the pumps turn over, adding up the
gallons and the cost of the gas.
Everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light
cast by the gas station. The STAR MAN pulls the camera disc
out of his pocket and points it at the pumps. The cone of
light flashes out and pulls back its three-dimensional image.
The Attendant turns around and waves genially at the STAR
MAN, who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture.
The SHARP RUMBLE of a SOUPED-UP HONDA MOTORCYCLE coming up
the off-ramp shatters the mood and the STAR MAN gets to his
feet.
He is startled by the image of the RIDER. In a one piece
driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space
traveller. The STAR MAN steps cautiously forward for a better
look and mutters something to himself in his language. The
rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings
himself stiffly out of the seat.
RIDER
Do I need a key for the head?
ATTENDANT
It's open.
Without taking off his helmet, the Rider sets out for the
men's room.
RIDER
(over his shoulder)
Fill it up.
ATTENDANT
You got it.
The rider's approach frightens the STAR MAN. He backs up to
the ladies' room door and knocks. There is no answer. He
tries the knob. With the other hand he inches the gun slightly
out of his pocket.
The STAR MAN tenses and forces a smile as the Rider passes
in front of him. A VOICE comes from behind the faceplate.
RIDER
Howdy... can't get her out.
STAR MAN
(thru the smile)
Gas.
RIDER
I know how she feels.
The rider enters the men's room. As the door closes behind
him, the STAR MAN's face falls and he knocks frantically on
the ladies' room door. Jenny opens it under his knuckles. He
blocks the doorway and she backs up as he steps inside.
A CAN of Coke CLATTERS DOWN the chute of a drink dispenser.
Jenny picks it up and, with the STAR MAN hovering at her
shoulder, moves on to the candy machine. He watches a quarter
disappear into the slot and when Jenny picks another one out
of her purse, he points to it.
STAR MAN
Money.
JENNY
Yes.
She inserts the quarter and makes her selection. A Reese's
Peanut Butter Cup drops from its position into the pickup
bin.
STAR MAN
What?
JENNY
Candy.
Using the change from this and another quarter, she selects
an Almond Joy.
STAR MAN
(as it tumbles into
the bin)
Money... candy.
ATTENDANT
(to the STAR MAN)
That'll be fifteen fifty, sir.
JENNY
Here.
She hands him a twenty.
ATTENDANT
Thank you.
He goes to make change.
STAR MAN
(to himself)
Thank you.
Jenny pops the top on the Coke can and on the way to the car
takes a sip.
STAR MAN
What is...
(reads off the can)
...Coke?
JENNY
A drink.
STAR MAN
(holds his hand out
for it)
I...
JENNY
You want to try it?
STAR MAN
I want to try it.
JENNY
This stuff could kill...
(changes her mind and
smiles)
Be my guest.
The STAR MAN fills his mouth, swirls it around and swallows.
STAR MAN
(after a loud burp)
Good.
He hands the can back to Jenny. She looks at it and knows
there are alien bacteria there her body would not like to
meet.
JENNY
Eh... you keep it. I've had enough.
The STAR MAN takes another drink. He stops dead when he lowers
the can. Jenny continues for a few steps before she realizes
he isn't with her. She looks back over her shoulder. Her
eyes go immediately to where he is looking. The license plate
PXV 237 hangs like an accusation on the front bumper of the
Mustang. Jenny decides to brazen it out.
JENNY
What's the matter?
STAR MAN
(throws the can to
the ground)
Shit!
Jenny speeds up to pass a truckload of horses.
STAR MAN
What is that?
She doesn't answer. The car passes the truck. The highway
before them is empty.
JENNY
(finally)
Horses.
STAR MAN
(without looking at
her)
Horses.
Jenny TURNS ON the RADIO and finds a COUNTRY AND WESTERN
STATION.
STAR MAN
What?
JENNY
Music.
It is pleasing to him and he listens for a while, then reaches
in his pouch and takes out one of the dusty gray marbles. He
rolls it between his palms. It changes to a glowing gold as
it grows to the size of a baseball.
JENNY
(alarmed)
What are you doing?!
The STAR MAN brings the globe close to his mouth and speaks
into it.
STAR MAN
(subtitles)
Iron channel message. Transmute was
successful. Have captured one of
them. It is taking me to the pick-up
point in a land vehicle.
(eyeing Jenny)
I think I can control it by mastering
its language, which is primitive and
easy to learn. Will arrive on time.
Wait for me.
The STAR MAN opens his hands and, to Jenny's astonishment,
the ball rises quickly and seeps through her roof without
leaving a trace.
The Mustang swerves violently, then straightens itself as
the ball comes through the roof and surges into the sky.
Unexpectedly, Shermin's helicopter storms into view. It is
so close we can count the rivets. As it clears, we go to:
Jenny's Mustang is barreling along well over the speed limit.
As it PASSES US, we PAN WITH it TO a sign: SLOW FOR
INTERSECTION.
A truckload of corn is hurtling down ON US from the north.
An empty semi is rumbling up from the south. The light is in
their favor.
It is as if all three vehicles have heard Jenny. They slam
on their brakes at the same time and begin to skid toward
each other. It's going to be close.
The Mustang barely squeaks through and the trucks slam into
each other behind it, spilling corn all over the highway.
Deftly, the STAR MAN moves in and out of the afternoon
traffic. A bus coming in the other direction hits a pothole
filled with water and the SPLASH covers the Mustang.
Over her shoulder, Jenny can see the Mustang coming. She
dodges up a brick walkway toward a J.C. Penney shopping mall.
The Mustang skids to a stop at the curb. The STAR MAN jumps
out in time to see Jenny push her way past a stream of
pedestrian traffic and enter the mall. He leaves the car and
zigzags through the people in that direction.
JENNY
Are you okay?
Still shaken, the STAR MAN nods. Jenny realizes that it is
comforting to him to have his hand in hers and she leads him
like a child down the sidewalk to the Mustang.
STAR MAN
(as Jenny puts him in
the passenger seat)
Thank you.
The Mall Guard follows them down the walk-way and watches
them drive off. He scribbles the license number in his
notebook.
JENNY
...you'll have plenty of time to get
to where you want to go.
The STAR MAN hangs back when he sees the security guards.
JENNY
Don't worry. They're not going to
hurt you. Come on.
(gives him ticket)
Only show this to the driver. Nobody
else. And don't lose it.
STAR MAN
Can I have the gun?
JENNY
No.
She maneuvers him into the end of the line.
JENNY
You might need this.
She takes some of the paper money out of her wallet and stuffs
it in his pocket.
JENNY
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you
and you'll be okay.
STAR MAN
(nervous)
Yes.
The line moves forward a step.
JENNY
Well... I'm going to go now.
STAR MAN
Go?
JENNY
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of
me...
(takes his hand)
Goodbye.
STAR MAN
Goodbye.
He watches her walk away.
STAR MAN
Jennyhaydn.
JENNY
Yes?
STAR MAN
Please stay.
Jenny comes back and takes his hand.
JENNY
I'll stay till you get on the bus.
A family of four climbs aboard and the line moves up. The
STAR MAN is alert to everything happening on the platform.
Jenny sneaks him an affectionate look. No one in front of
him has baggage to check and they move quickly past the DRIVER
until the STAR MAN is next in line.
DRIVER
Ticket?
The STAR MAN hands the Driver his ticket. The Driver rips
out the first coupon and hands it back.
JENNY
See? You're going to be okay.
When they stop at the door, she impulsively kisses him on
the cheek.
JENNY
Goodbye.
STAR MAN
(touches his cheek)
What?
JENNY
It's a kiss...
(she motions for him
to get on the bus)
Goodbye...
DRIVER
Let's go.
The STAR MAN climbs the steps just ahead of him. The door
closes. Its ENGINE REVVING, the bus backs out of its stall.
Jenny catches a glimpse of the STAR MAN bent over in the
aisle looking out at her. She waves until the bus rounds the
building.
Jenny's green Mustang loops around the end of a row of cars
and heads for the street.
The security guard tags Shermin into the parking lot.
SECURITY GUARD
Eyewitnesses are the worst. You get
two of them together. You got three
stories. You know what I mean?
Shermin sees Lyman come out of the crowd surrounding the
police cars in front of the helicopter.
SECURITY GUARD
Is there a reward in this?
SHERMIN
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
SECURITY GUARD
Because I'm the one who called the
police, you know.
SHERMIN
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
SECURITY GUARD
Hey, it's none of my business why
you're chasing a retard... You want
my opinion, it's the girl. She had
to hold the guy's hand all the way
to the car like he was a kid.
SHERMIN
You saw that?
SECURITY GUARD
Hey... he didn't look like no big
time criminal to me.
Lyman meets them. It is obvious he has something to tell
Shermin.
SECURITY GUARD
Eh... the store tells you to call
when there's trouble, so they won't
get sued... But that shouldn't matter
if there's a reward, right?
SHERMIN
I wouldn't think so.
SECURITY GUARD
(peeling off)
That's what I thought. So remember
it was me because sometimes rewards
come late, you know.
SHERMIN
We will.
(he turns to Lyman)
Something's wrong here. She's helping
him now.
LYMAN
(alarmed)
I know. She bought him a ticket for
Lathrop Wells and put him on the
bus. He didn't stay on though and
they drove off together.
SHERMIN
(shaking his head)
Doesn't make sense.
LYMAN
Maybe he's turned her into one of
them. They enter the crowd around
the helicopter.
The Mustang cruises along between fields of corn.
JENNY (V.O.)
Why did your ship land on this
planet... on Earth?
STAR MAN (V.O.)
It was a mistake.
The following conversation will be played over various views
of Americana: a station wagon load of kids, waving and
laughing, lovers kissing at a bus stop, billboards, car lots,
a dog taking a leak against a tree, cheerleaders practicing
on a football field, a funeral cortege, a telephone repairman
up on a pole.
JENNY
You thought we were a different
planet?!
STAR MAN
No. My ship was doing a map of all
the suns and...
JENNY
Stars... When a sun is far away, we
call it a 'star.'
STAR MAN
We were doing a map of the stars and
all the other things up there when
we saw a small ship. My... eh... we
kidnapped it. On it there was a map
that said how to come to Earth. This
was very important. Before then, we
thought we were the only people in
all the stars.
JENNY
You did? That's funny. So did we.
STAR MAN
Yes?
JENNY
Yes.
STAR MAN
We told our home, and the people who
tell us what to do on my planet said
to come and look but not to talk,
not to land, not to shoot. Just to
look from up there. We came and...
the driver of my ship...
JENNY
The captain...
STAR MAN
The captain wanted to land to see
close and to get some things from
Earth to take home. The police came
and shot at us. One of the people
from my ship was killed.
JENNY
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was
he a good friend?
STAR MAN
I don't understand 'friend.'
JENNY
A friend is a person that is good to
you... someone you like to be with...
someone you like to laugh with...
STAR MAN
He was a good friend... The captain
took the ship away fast and I was
not in the ship.
JENNY
The police shouldn't have started
shooting. But you can hardly blame
them. You surprised them. They didn't
know you were up there. When they
saw you, they thought you were here
to hurt us.
STAR MAN
I understand.
JENNY
Sounds like your captain's going to
get hell when he gets back home.
STAR MAN
What is hell?
JENNY
It's bad.
STAR MAN
He will.
Pause. Jenny feels the STAR MAN staring at her. She turns to
look at him. His gaze doesn't waver. She looks back at the
road, then back at the STAR MAN.
JENNY
What are you doing?
STAR MAN
Are you my friend?
JENNY
Yes.
STAR MAN
(smiles)
I am your friend.
Jenny's Mustang is whipping west out of Lincoln, Nebraska.
We HEAR A JUMBLE OF RADIO STATIONS as the SELECTOR is RUN
THROUGH THE FREQUENCIES.
With the STAR MAN's SERENADE WAFTING over the Nebraska plains,
we FALL BACK TO FIND a Highway Patrol car tagging along at a
safe distance behind the Mustang.
The STAR MAN stops the Mustang in front of the office. He
and Jenny get out and go inside. As the door closes on them,
three Nebraska Highway Patrol cars speed up the off-ramp.
The lead car turns right on a surface street and enters the
motel parking lot at the far end.
The middle car goes straight across the intersection and
positions itself at the curb next to the driveway, giving
access to a frontage road which leads to an on-ramp. The
last car also turns right on the surface street, but parks
in a restaurant parking lot directly across from the office.
STAR MAN
I want a drink. May I have two
quarters?
At the passenger door, Jenny sets her purse on the car roof
to take out her wallet.
JENNY
(handing it to him)
You shouldn't drink so much of that
stuff. It's bad for you.
STAR MAN
On the radio they say it's good.
JENNY
Hurry up.
Over her purse she notices the patrol car facing her from
the restaurant parking lot. There is certainly nothing unusual
about a patrol car in a restaurant parking lot. She shrugs
it off and gets in the Mustang.
The Mustang moves toward the frontage road.
All three patrol cars jam on their rack lights and, with
their SIRENS HOWLING, peel out after Jenny and the STAR MAN.
The Mustang careens down the on-ramp and squeezes into the
traffic a hair's breath ahead of an 18-wheeler. This cuts
off the patrol cars momentarily, but the Mustang doesn't
have the speed to stay ahead of them. Using the other cars
on the road as shields, the STAR MAN dodges from lane to
lane trying to keep the police from coming alongside.
Caught by surprise, the patrol cars rocket ahead of him. The
Mustang cuts across the swatch of land that acts as a center
divider in the highway and races west in the eastbound lanes.
The lead patrol car tries to follow him but is clipped by a
Cadillac swerving to avoid the STAR MAN and bounced back
into the center divider. The last patrol car parallels the
Mustang in the westbound lanes.
The Mustang vaults off the shoulder of the highway into an
open field and bullets away through the weeds.
The rush of oncoming traffic traps the three patrol cars in
the center divider.
We FOLLOW the Mustang as it winds upward through the grazing
lands sparsely dotted with clumps of trees. The plume of
dust kicked up by the fleeing car is turned silver by a full
moon. The WAIL OF the PATROL CARS is DISTANT BUT CLOSING.
The Mustang barrels around a curve and slides to a surprise
stop before a gate in a barbed wire fence that ends the road.
With the .45 in his hand, the STAR MAN jumps out of the car
and tries the gate. It is locked.
When he turns back to the car, he sees something that
frightens him more than the approaching patrol cars. A
helicopter has joined the chase. He looks for a place to
hide. A stand of cottonwood and elm fifty yards on the other
side of the gate offers the only protection.
The STAR MAN opens the passenger door. Jenny is soaked in
her own blood. He hooks the strap of her purse over his
shoulder, lifts her tenderly and, cradling her in his arms,
wiggles between a fence post and the gate and jogs into the
trees.
The helicopter sets down behind the Mustang. Shermin leads
Bell, Lyman and the technicians to the car.
LYMAN
(seeing the blood on
the passenger seat)
One of them must be pretty badly
hurt.
Shermin pushes the seat forward. The STAR MAN's life-support
suit is stuffed in the space behind it. The patrol cars skid
around the curve.
SHERMIN
(to Bell, indicating
the suit)
Get this back to the copter.
Shermin takes a bullhorn from Lyman and goes around to the
front of the Mustang. The highway patrolmen get out of their
cars behind him.
SHERMIN
(bullhorn to woods)
Mrs. Haydn, please come out. We don't
want to hurt you or your friend.
Please put down your weapon and come
out.
Jenny's limp weight is beginning to slow the STAR MAN. He
hears the bullhorn but doesn't stop.
Shermin lowers the bullhorn and speaks to the patrolmen.
SHERMIN
Okay, fan out. These people have a
gun but we want them alive.
Understand?
A deep shadow on the other side of an elm offers a likely
hiding place. He moves through the underbrush toward it.
Without warning, his feet begin to slip out from under him.
He struggles to regain his balance.
When he does he looks down to find himself staring at a RAGING
RIVER 150 feet below. The bank on the other side is just a
few feet above the water and in the moonlight he can see a
flat plain cut by a highway that stretches into the distance.
Slowly, he backs away from the edge of the cliff.
From under the elm he watches the helicopter sweep out over
the ravine. Its searchlight darts toward him bleaching the
treeline. The overhanging branches cloak him and Jenny and
the light passes without picking them up. The STAR MAN adjusts
his grip on Jenny and starts off in the opposite direction
from the helicopter to look for a way down the cliff.
Shermin, his people and the patrolmen are combing the woods
with flashlights in a picketline search. The Third Driver
stops at the mouth of a clearing that runs between the
cottonwood and elm to the cliff. He takes a bite off a block
of chewing tobacco.
As he replaces it in his pocket, he sees a shadow flit across
the far end of the clearing. He swings his flashlight in
that direction. The beam catches a piece of Jenny and the
STAR MAN.
THIRD DRIVER
Over here! They're over here!
Standing on the rim of the gorge, the STAR MAN sees the rays
of his pursuers' flashlights choking off any possible escape.
He eases Jenny to the ground behind a boulder. She whimpers
with the pain.
STAR MAN
(strokes her cheek)
You will be all right.
He stretches over the top of the boulder and scatters FOUR
SHOTS at the lights.
The patrolmen, the technicians and Shermin all hit the ground
and kill their lights.
SHERMIN
Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt
you. Put down your gun and come out.
We just want to talk to your friend.
THE STAR MAN AND JENNY
The STAR MAN peers around the boulder. At that instant the
searchlight from the helicopter happens to splash across the
men in the field. He sees that their guns are drawn and
pointed in his direction. The STAR MAN pulls back and takes
a marble from his pouch. It grows and glows gold as the STAR
MAN rolls it between his palms. When it reaches the size of
a baseball, he clutches it firmly in his right hand and
EMPTIES the .45 toward Shermin and the police. This time,
there is a BARRAGE OF ANSWERING FIRE.
With the BULLETS RICOCHETING around him, the STAR MAN lifts
Jenny to his shoulder. He massages the golden orb until it
becomes the size of a soccer ball, then takes two quick steps
to the edge of the cliff and leaps into the abyss.
The upward thrust of the ball supports their fall and under
its glow they begin a slow descent to the other side of the
river. Above them, the helicopter dips back and locks its
searchlight on the shelf of boulders they just left.
The STAR MAN sets down with the smoothness of a man stepping
off an escalator. He looks over his shoulder. The helicopter
is still concentrating its spotlight on the ridge. He speaks
to the ball in his language.
STAR MAN
(subtitles)
Iron channel message. Almost caught
by pursuers. This may hinder escape.
Wait for me.
He lets the ball go and, with even more velocity than the
others, it zips into the sky.
DISSOLVE TO:
A WOMAN in a Frederick's of Hollywood negligee lets a TRUCK
DRIVER out of one of the Winnebagos parked to the side of
the main building.
WOMAN
Don't forget to tell the boys where
you had a good time.
DRIVER
(calling back to her)
You weren't that good.
Her rusty laugh follows him into the parking lot. He walks
between the trucks to a semi which has half of a pre-fab
mobile home tied onto its flat-bed. The polyethylene that
covers the open side of the house flaps in the WIND at the
lower corner next to the cab. The Driver opens his door. He
takes out a staple gun and refastens the dark green plastic
to the house frame.
With the Driver taking it smoothly through the gears, the
semi picks up speed.
With its pre-fab house, the semi rumbles through Julesburg,
Sterling and Ft. Morgan. By the time it gets to Denver, dawn
is beginning to color the tips of the Rocky Mountains.
Colorado Highway PATROLMEN are dropping orange fluorescent
cones across two of the three westbound lanes to form a
roadblock. The sound of a harmonica draws us to Shermin's
helicopter parked in a meadow beside the road.
As the radio technician plays the harmonica, Lyman clangs
down the steps and bends to wake Shermin who is sacked out
under the fuselage.
SHERMIN
Tell him I'm not here.
LYMAN
I did.
Shermin sighs and rolls over on his back. He looks terrible.
SHERMIN
Get me a radio. At least I won't
have to look at his face.
Shermin is holding a field radio to his ear.
FOX (V.O.)
We're growing very concerned back
here. There's no use pretending
otherwise. We're rapidly approaching
a 'condition red.' People are
beginning to ask difficult questions.
SHERMIN
I'll make this as simple as I can,
George. They disappeared.
FOX (V.O.)
I don't care where you're from you
just can't disappear into thin air.
SHERMIN
(through a punchy
hysterical laugh)
George, listen to what you're saying.
This thing's changed itself into a
man. Disappearing may not be that
big a deal.
FOX (V.O.)
So far you've let it cross the heart
of America. For two days it has been
absorbing information that is
detrimental to our security. I don't
see the humor in that.
Stung, Shermin takes a deep breath, controls himself and
returns the radio to his ear.
SHERMIN
Maybe... look, this is just something
to think about... from what I got at
the shopping center, it was more
scared than anything else... I don't
feel it's as big a threat as you
think it is...
FOX (V.O.)
Is that what's affecting your
performance?
SHERMIN
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm
doing my damndest to catch them.
Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on
70 past Grand Junction. They're
heading west. If they're not flying
we have a damn good chance of getting
them. All I'm asking is that you
people think about it.
FOX (V.O.)
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll
make the policy.
The semi is in the slow lane. Its right rear turn signal
blinks steadily telling US that it is leaving the highway
and going north at the intersection ahead.
The semi is picking up speed as it heads north.
The Driver checks his side view mirror to see if the lane
next to him is clear and is astonished to see a woman's arm
sticking out of the polyethylene waving a blouse at him.
Smoke billows from under the tires as the semi skids to a
stop.
Jenny, her purse over her shoulder, is running toward the
cab as the Driver steps out with a wrench in his hand.
JENNY
Where did you stop last?
DRIVER
What the hell do you think you're
doing?
JENNY
Where did you stop last?
DRIVER
Stay right there...
JENNY
What was your last stop?
DRIVER
Elmo's...
JENNY
Where's that?
DRIVER
About five miles back.
Jenny's thumb is already out for a ride as she sprints across
the highway.
DRIVER
(shouting after her)
Are there any more in there?
A passing car TAKES US TO the STAR MAN as he runs along the
shoulder to a maroon and white '57 Chevy that has pulled off
to pick him up.
A swarthy, bald MAN with hairy arms leans across the seat.
MAN
Where are you going?
STAR MAN
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak
English.
MAN
Hop in.
A truck stop set back as little as the law allows from the
BUZZ OF INTERSTATE 70.
JENNY (O.S.)
I'm looking for a guy about this
tall, with brown hair and really
gray eyes...
We FIND Jenny at the set of fuel pumps nearest the highway
dogging an ATTENDANT while he services an 18-wheeler
JENNY
He had on tan cords, a plaid shirt
and a baseball cap... probably
hitchhiking.
ATTENDANT
I don't pay much attention to those
guys.
JENNY
(taking out her wallet)
In the last hour or so...
ATTENDANT
Nope.
Jenny folds back the plastic windows to the picture of her
husband.
JENNY
This is him.
ATTENDANT
(shakes his head)
Sorry.
We FOLLOW Jenny as she wends her way through the trucks
questioning other attendants. The RUMBLE OF TRAFFIC DROWNS
OUT their CONVERSATION, but the answer is always the same.
Finally, we FOLLOW the picture as Jenny hands it up to an
ATTENDANT cleaning the windshield on a Peterbilt cab.
SECOND ATTENDANT
(looking at picture)
I don't know... I'm not sure. I might
have seen him up the road a piece on
my way in. He's long gone by now.
He hands the snapshot back to Jenny. She nods a 'thank you'
and looks wistfully around the yard. There is nothing she
can do. Fitting the picture back into her wallet, she walks
away. After a few steps she turns back.
JENNY
You know if anybody here's going to
Wisconsin?
SECOND ATTENDANT
Ask inside.
Standing back of the officers, Shermin watches them check to
cars passing through the squeeze point. Every car trunk is
opened. Vans and campers are looked into.
Lyman runs up and whispers in Shermin's ear. Shermin is
startled by what he hears. He leaves Lyman in charge and
hurries to the helicopter parked in the field beside the
roadblock.
Shermin's helicopter lifts off.
SHERMIN (V.O.)
Mrs. Haydn, I'm going to have to ask
you to stay where you are.
The Cook's '57 Chevy makes a left on the street intersecting
the off-ramp and stops at the curb. Behind it a large plastic
yellow chicken twirls on a pole above the restaurant it
advertises.
COOK
Well, here we are... You go down
that ramp there, you're sure to get
a ride.
STAR MAN
(getting out)
Thank you.
COOK
And don't be shy about your English.
You speak better than a lot of people
I know.
(leaving)
Take care of yourself.
As an afterthought, the STAR MAN duplicates the Cook's wave,
then heads down the ramp. As he clears the frame, our VIEW
ZOOMS AND ZOOMS AND ZOOMS UNTIL we can SEE a piece of the
roadblock in the valley below him. During the MOVE-IN, we
BEGIN TO PICK UP CB CHATTER.
VOICES (V.O.)
Flash for all you good buddies heading
west on 70. Smoky's got a roadblock
just beyond Grand Junction... Better
dump your dope, they're going through
everything... He's right. I was just
there and I'm still sore...
In the style prescribed by Jenny, the STAR MAN raises his
thumb to a dilapidated Vega shimmying down the on-ramp. The
two blue-haired ladies inside are afraid to look at him as
they go by. He has the same luck with an attractive blonde
secretary that passes on the highway.
A highway PATROLMAN is standing behind the open door of his
car speaking into the mike of his radio.
PATROLMAN
The girl's not here, Mr. Shermin.
Seems right after she talked to you,
she got a ride west with a kid.
Shermin's S65 banks through a U-turn and chases west.
A dun-colored Roadrunner gurgles down the ramp and stops in
front of the STAR MAN. Two grubby LONG HAIRS in worn western
clothes are inside with boxes of house-hold utensils and
duffle bags.
LONG HAIR
Where you going?
STAR MAN
Las Vegas, please.
LONG HAIR
We're going to L.A.
He looks at his buddy stretched on the jumble in the back.
The buddy nods.
LONG HAIR
Sure. Get in. We can drop you in
Vegas or get you darn close.
The STAR MAN opens the door and gets in.
The Porsche weaves through the traffic giving Jenny a chance
to look into the cars and trucks it shoots by.
The Porsche slows to a stop on the shoulder.
TEENAGER
(as Jenny opens the
door)
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
JENNY
Sure.
She leans back and gives the startled Teenager a kiss on the
mouth, then gets out.
TEENAGER
I have nothing to do. I'd like to
help you.
JENNY
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
She closes the door. The Teenager takes a last look at her
before pulling back on the highway. Jenny waits for a car in
the slow lane to go by, then runs across to the line and
waits for cars in the fast lane to go by.
Jenny spins around to see the Roadrunner skid to a stop on
the shoulder and the STAR MAN get out. A motorcycle bombs
by. He starts across the lanes of traffic toward Jenny. A
truck blasts past him in the slow lane. He is buffeted into
the fast lane. Jenny runs down the center divider to meet
him. A VW honks, its tires squeal on the pavement as it
swerves around him. He reaches the safety of the center
divider. Jenny throws her arms around him and lays her head
against his chest. He stands there uncomfortably not knowing
how to respond to this human emotion.
STAR MAN
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
JENNY
The police are waiting for you up
ahead. There's a roadblock. You have
to go back.
STAR MAN
This car will take me to Las Vegas.
I cannot go back.
JENNY
The police know about Lathrop Wells.
We have to go another way. Come on.
She grabs his wrist but he hangs back.
STAR MAN
If I don't meet the ship, my people
will go home without me.
JENNY
Please understand. If you go this
way, you'll never get to your ship.
The police know about Lathrop Wells.
We have to go another way. I'll get
you to your ship. I promise.
STAR MAN
I will go. But not you.
JENNY
You shit! I'll decide if I go or
not. Not you. I don't know what you
do on your planet, but I didn't think
that was very nice walking out on me
like you did.
STAR MAN
I don't want you to be hurt.
JENNY
Come on.
Holding the STAR MAN's hand, Jenny pulls him toward the road.
JENNY
I didn't ask to come along on this
trip, but I sure as hell am going to
be the one to say when I get off.
They bolt across the lanes of traffic to the other side of
the road where she flags down an old black pickup truck. She
says something to the driver and she and the STAR MAN climb
into the back. As the truck returns to the highway, the CLACK
OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER OVERPOWERS the TRAFFIC SOUNDS.
Shermin's helicopter slices around a pine-dotted peak
following the twists of Interstate 70 below. In the near
distance, we can SEE the roadblock.
Lyman, wearing a headset plugged into a belt pack, is walking
down the line of cars.
LYMAN
I don't think they're going to show.
Two highway patrol cars scatter the traffic in front of them
with their rack lights and SIRENS.
Jenny and the STAR MAN are sitting against the cab, a horse
blanket drawn up around their shoulders. They can see the
flashing lights coming from way down the road and watch
helplessly as the patrol cars eat up the distance between
them.
The pickup makes the turn onto Highway 550.
For a moment, Jenny and the STAR MAN think they're safe.
That hope turns to despair when the two patrol cars loop
after them. They keep getting closer. The STAR MAN inches
the blanket up over his nose. Unexpectedly, the patrol cars
are thrown into a skid. When they stop, they are facing each
other ready to inspect the traffic coming off 70. They lower
the blanket from their faces. Jenny lays her head back against
the cab, exhausted.
STAR MAN
The Cook said I speak good English.
DISSOLVE TO:
A RUMBLE OF DISTANT THUNDER follows the lightning that flashes
from the dark clouds hanging on the horizon. Looking
incomplete without its trailer, the tractor/cab of a Mack
truck makes a turn on a farm road, revealing Jenny and the
STAR MAN standing on the gravel. The STAR MAN looks back to
where they came from. There is nothing coming so he sets out
in the other direction.
JENNY
Where are you going?
STAR MAN
I must meet my ship.
JENNY
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
STAR MAN
I feel better if I move.
JENNY
We're hundreds of miles from where
you have to be.
The STAR MAN ignores her and continues to walk.
JENNY
(shouts at him)
Even if we walk five miles, it's not
going to make any difference.
Jenny turns toward an oncoming car and sticks out her thumb.
The STAR MAN falls into the same pose just back of her. The
car honks at them as it breezes by.
STAR MAN
(screams after it)
Asshole!!
JENNY
(shocked)
Where did you learn that?
STAR MAN
The cook.
A torrential rainstorm lashes the countryside. The STAR MAN
and Jenny splash along the edge of the asphalt. Their heads
are lowered against the weather. They are both drenched to
the skin.
JENNY
(after a few steps)
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
STAR MAN
I can't stay on this planet.
JENNY
No one's traveling in this weather.
STAR MAN
You promised you would get me to my
ship.
JENNY
(shouts after him)
I will. I will. We still have another
day.
STAR MAN
You promised.
JENNY
What do you want from me? There are
no cars on this road. I didn't ask
for this stupid storm.
The STAR MAN mutters in his language.
JENNY
What are you saying?
STAR MAN
You can stop. I will go on alone.
JENNY
We're too far away to walk. Don't
you understand?
The STAR MAN looks at her. With the rain streaming off his
face, he looks at her. For the first time, the reality of
the situation hits him. He turns and, swearing in his own
language, flails at the rain. A distance from Jenny, he stops
and cries out in English.
STAR MAN
I can't stay here. I want to go home.
I don't want this skin. I don't want
to look like this.
Jenny can see him standing with his head bowed. She walks
over to him.
JENNY
(trying to ease his
pain)
Why don't you send one of your radio
balloons and tell your captain that
you might be late?
STAR MAN
I used the last one to jump off the
cliff...
JENNY
Let's find a place out of the rain.
I'm sure we'll get a ride in the
morning.
STAR MAN
I can't be late. I don't know if the
radio balloons work above your planet.
I don't know if my words went to the
ship. If I'm not there, the captain
will think I'm dead and go.
JENNY
We'll get a ride in the morning.
A flash of lightning shows us:
Jenny and the STAR MAN are following the tracks to an
abandoned boxcar.
Jenny joins the STAR MAN at the fence.
JENNY
Good morning.
STAR MAN
Horses.
JENNY
You don't forget anything, do you?
STAR MAN
No.
Jenny pets one of the horses on the nose.
JENNY
(to the horse)
Hello... hello. How are you this
morning?
STAR MAN
Do they talk?!
JENNY
(laughs)
No, they don't talk... We talk to
them.
STAR MAN
I understand.
An appaloosa nudges her way through the others to the fence.
JENNY
Oh, you're pretty...
STAR MAN
I gave you a baby last night.
Shocked, Jenny looks at him from around the appaloosa's nose.
The STAR MAN is combing a horse's mane with his fingers and
he doesn't see her expression.
STAR MAN
(meaning the horses)
They are beautiful.
JENNY
Yes, they are.
STAR MAN
You have been very good to me,
Jennyhaydn.
(turns to face her)
You said you wanted a baby, so I
gave you one.
JENNY
(shakes her head 'no')
But...
STAR MAN
It will be human and it will look
like this.
(touches his face)
But when it comes it will know
everything I know and everything you
know. That is something from my planet
that I want your baby to have.
JENNY
I told you it's impossible for me to
have a baby.
STAR MAN
You will have this baby. If you want
it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
Jenny comes over and puts her arms around the STAR MAN.
JENNY
I want it.
A formation of six black Bell Cobra helicopters rush at us
out of the blue. From above them we can see that they are
heading for a small desert town. 'Welcome to Lathrop Wells'
is spelled out on a hillside in white-washed stones.
Grubby, unshaven and unwashed, Shermin, Bell, Lyman and the
rest of the crew watch the seven Cobras land in sequence.
Fox, immaculate in a freshly pressed black flight suit, climbs
out of the first one down and he and Shermin meet in the
middle of the runway.
SHERMIN
Hello George.
FOX
Shermin...
SHERMIN
What's all this for?
FOX
We have a new directive. I'm taking
over.
SHERMIN
(scans the Cobras)
We don't have to do it that way. We
can catch him this time.
FOX
Washington thinks it's too late for
that.
SHERMIN
I've never been taken off an
assignment in my life. Give me twenty-
four hours and I'll have him for
you.
FOX
You're not hearing me.
SHERMIN
You can change a directive, George.
You've done it before. Listen to me.
He's going somewhere in Death Valley.
Lathrop Wells was never anything but
a bus stop. East is the nuclear site.
There are no roads in there. She was
teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling
you. We block the four roads into
Death Valley and we got him.
FOX
We'll do that. But how are we going
to hold him? He can change himself
into a man. He can disappear.
SHERMIN
That's the chance we have to take.
FOX
No, we don't.
SHERMIN
Then you're going to have to do it
without me.
FOX
You're a career intelligence officer,
Shermin. You'll be in the air with
us.
SHERMIN
You're talking about taking a life.
The most unique life form on this
planet. I think we're better than
that.
A fire-engine-red Pontiac convertible with two COWBOYS (late
fifties) in the front and Jenny and the STAR MAN in the back
moves with the traffic along the main drag in the downtown
area. The STAR MAN's head swivels from side to side trying
to take in the neon that juts up around him. The convertible
stops at a light. The cowboy on the passenger side opens the
door and tips his hat to Jenny as she and the Star Man get
out of the back seat.
The STAR MAN is afraid of the crush of people and wants to
stay close to Jenny, but is fascinated by the whir and click
and jingle of the one-armed bandits that seem to be
everywhere.
STAR MAN
Is this gambling?
Jenny nods. A LADY in curlers and pedal pushers hits a twenty
dollar jackpot. Hanging onto Jenny's hand the STAR MAN turns
around and walks sideways to watch the quarters tumble out
into the lady's shopping bag.
STAR MAN
The cowboys were right. You can make
money fast gambling.
JENNY
You don't make money gambling. You
lose it.
A dot in the distance becomes a brand new Camaro. As it blasts
away from under us we see a paper license in its back window.
The cabin light is on inside the car.
With the STAR MAN SINGING IN HIS LANGUAGE, the Camaro moves
further into Death Valley. The SONG FADES and we:
DISSOLVE TO:
The Camaro blows by a gas station, closed for the night.
The STAR MAN is looking through a window at the repair bay,
lit by a work light. Jenny is standing in a phone shell on
the front of the garage, the receiver to her ear.
The STAR MAN moves to the office door. He tries the knob. It
is locked.
JENNY
(to the STAR MAN)
They're trying to get him.
Suddenly the STAR MAN slams his shoulder against the door.
It swings open.
JENNY
What are you doing?!!
Fox's voice comes out of the receiver in her hand.
FOX (V.O.)
Mrs. Haydn...
JENNY
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm
hanging up.
FOX (V.O.)
(a beat)
Okay...
Tethered by the phone cord, Jenny tries to see what the STAR
MAN is doing inside the repair bay.
SHERMIN (V.O.)
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
STAR MAN
I understand.
He hangs up.
Carrying the modified Black and Decker drill the STAR MAN
opens the driver's door.
JENNY
Where do you think you're going?
STAR MAN
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good.
I must go alone now.
JENNY
I said I would get you to your ship
and that's where we're going to say
goodbye.
The Camaro whizzes through the falling DEBRIS.
The Camaro becomes airborne at the crest of a dip. Only its
new shocks save the landing.
SHOTS THUMP INTO the trunk in front of the STAR MAN and he
FIRES. The lead HELICOPTER ERUPTS, raining pieces of hot
metal over the desert floor. The other helicopters are jarred
out of their run and their BULLETS harmlessly KICK UP SAND
on the shoulder. Before they can regroup, the STAR MAN BLOWS
THEM OUT OF THE SKY.
JENNY
In front!!! In front!!!
The STAR MAN has to hang on as Jenny dodges the car out of
the path of a Cobra skimming over the highway toward them.
As it goes over, he is able to get off a SHOT directly INTO
its UNDERBELLY. The BALL OF FLAME almost engulfs the Camaro.
At the base of a sandstone cliff, the Camaro slides to a
stop. Jenny helps the STAR MAN out. She supports him as they
struggle toward the protection of the boulders. Fox's Cobra
roars over the hill.
The STAR MAN turns toward the Cobra. Weakly, he raises his
weapon and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. The searchlight
from the Cobra finds them. Its machine guns begin to raise
puffs of gravel around them. Jenny grabs the STAR MAN's arm
and pulls him into the relative safety of the rocks. The
STAR MAN collapses against the cool stone.
STAR MAN
(gasps)
I can't shoot anymore.
Jenny looks out between the crags. Shermin's helicopter
arrives to join the Cobra. With their searchlights flicking
over the sagebrush, they move cautiously toward the cliff.
Jenny turns back to the STAR MAN. He is too weak to run
anymore.
JENNY
(touches his shoulder
lightly)
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Shermin's helicopter moves toward Jenny and the STAR MAN
standing helpless in the circle thrown by the searchlight.
Shermin's helicopter passes over the heads of Jenny and the
STAR MAN and rises into the dawn sky.
The spacecraft passes over the top of the helicopter. The
whirling downdraft emanating from the spaceship's underbelly
yanks the Cobra away from Jenny and the STAR MAN and whips
it into a spin which gets faster and faster until it
disintegrates and falls to the desert floor.
Jenny and the STAR MAN shield their faces against the DUST
STORM that billows under the WHINING DESCENT of the
spacecraft. It settles into a landing across the dirt road
resting on its three pods. With a crack, a cone of bright
white light blasts from the underside.
JENNY
Well...
STAR MAN
I must go.
Jenny nods.
STAR MAN
What do I do now?
JENNY
You say you love me and kiss me
'goodbye.'
The STAR MAN puts his arms around her and holds her tight.
STAR MAN
I love you.
JENNY
(her head on his
shoulder)
I'm never going to see you again, am
I?
STAR MAN
No.
He kisses the tears out of her eyes, then full on the mouth.
JENNY
I love you.
The STAR MAN steps back and places a hand on Jenny's stomach.
STAR MAN
Tell the baby about me.
JENNY
I will.
STAR MAN
Goodbye.
He turns from her and walks to his ship. Jenny watches him
go, then remembers something.
JENNY
Wait!!
She gets the Webster's Dictionary and the Columbia History
of the World from the Camaro and runs to the STAR MAN. He
takes them and kisses her again.
STAR MAN
Thank you, Jennyhaydn.
Jenny backs away as the STAR MAN walks under the ship into
the white light. He waves one last time to Jenny and is
swallowed into the ship by the light.
Jenny turns away from the stinging sand as the space-craft
lifts off. When she looks again, it is high and moving over
the foothills. A banking turn brings it back. The ship dips
low over her, rocks itself in a gesture of farewell, then
shoots off into the stars. When she can no longer see it,
Jenny drops her wave with a sigh and starts back toward the
Camaro.
Over her walk, we SUPER:
