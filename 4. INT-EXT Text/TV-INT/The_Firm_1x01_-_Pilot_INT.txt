      The door to ROOM 1801.  On the cut, DANIEL MOXON, mid-
      forties, OPENS the door and ushers Mitch inside.  Moxon wears 
      wire-rimmed glasses, his thinning hair neatly combed.  At the 
      moment, he s beyond nervous.  He SNIFFS when he talks, maybe 
      from a cold, or maybe it s an anxious tic.                                                                                        4.


                                  MOXON
                    You re McDeere (sniff)?

                                  MITCH
                    Yes.  Mr. Moxon?

                                  MOXON
                    Daniel (sniff).  Were you followed?

                                  MITCH
                    No.

      Moxon realizes that Mitch is wet.

                                  MOXON
                    What s this?

                                  MITCH
                          (admitting)
                    I was followed, but I lost them.  
                    Thank you for coming.

                                  MOXON
                    (sniff).  I shouldn t be here.  
                    Five minutes.  That s what you 
                    said.  Then I m gone (sniff).

      Mitch OPENS his briefcase.  He removes a PHOTO and shows it 
      to Moxon.  NOTE: we DON T SEE the photo.

                                  MITCH
                    Mr. Moxon, this is my client.  Do 
                    you know who this is?

                                  MOXON
                    No.

                                  MITCH
                    I think you do.  I think you know 
                    why I m here.

                                  MOXON
                          (slight panic)
                    You called my extension.  Three 
                    times.  They know that.  Don t you 
                    think they know that?  You came to 
                    see me at the office-- 

                                  MITCH
                    I m sorry--

                                  MOXON
                    Sorry?  You show up, using my name, 
                    asking questions (sniff)--                                                                                      5.


                                  MITCH
                    Daniel.  People are dead.  And 
                    bottom line, the trail leads me to 
                    you and your company.  I want to 
                    know the truth.

      Silence.  Then, weakly:

                                  MOXON
                    They ll kill me.  Hell, I m already 
                    dead.

                                  MITCH
                    Then let me protect you.  I know 
                    people.  The FBI.

      And now Moxon looks right at Mitch:

                                  MOXON
                    Do you have any idea how foolish 
                    you sound?
                          (then, weakly)
                    I ve done things.  Horrible things.  
                    I ve tried to live with them.  But 
                    I can t anymore.

                                  MITCH
                    I m listening.

      He wants to talk.  Mitch is close.  But suddenly, there s a 
      BANGING on the door.  The door rattles on its hinges--

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mr. McDeere.  Hotel Security.  Open 
                    the door please.

      Moxon shoots a terrified look to Mitch.

                                  MOXON
                    I thought you said you lost them.

                                  MITCH
                    It s not security.  Security would 
                    have a key.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mitch McDeere.  Daniel Moxon.  We 
                    know you re in there.

      The BANGING increases.  Someone is KICKING at the door--

                                  MOXON
                    I can t help you.  And you can t 
                    help me.                                                                                      6.


      Mitch rushes to the HOTEL PHONE.  He picks it up, dials for 
      the FRONT DESK.  But as he does, Moxon walks to the BALCONY 
      DOOR, which we now realize is OPEN.  Mitch looks up just in 
      time to SEE Moxon reach the BALCONY.

                                  MITCH
                    Mr. Moxon.  Daniel, what are you--

      And without another word, Moxon STEPS OFF THE BALCONY.  One 
      second he s there, and then he s gone.  Mitch drops the phone 
      and races to the ledge.  He arrives just in time to see Moxon 
      hit the ground, 18 stories below.

      We quickly REVERSE ANGLE, to see Mitch staring over the ledge 
      in shock.  As the CAMERA ZOOMS UPWARD, racing toward his face 
      at high speed, we finally SMASH TO:

                                          THE FIRM

      OVER BLACK:

      A TITLE CARD READS:  ELEVEN YEARS EARLIER...

      FADE IN:


      JUDGE WALTER HUFF, sixties, with a calm voice and a shock of 
      white hair (think Donald Sutherland) presides.  The courtroom 
      is almost empty but there s a festive, holiday air.

      And now we FIND MITCH.  The CAMERA PUSHES IN CLOSE as he 
      steps forward:                                                                                      7.


                                  MITCH
                    Mitchell McDeere for the defendant.

                                  KEVIN
                          (also approaching)
                    Kevin Hanophy for the IRS.

                                  MITCH
                    Your Honor, the defense has 
                    received the IRS complaint and I 
                    have a few motions to submit--

                                  JUDGE HUFF
                    I m sorry, counsel.
                          (then, happy)
                    It appears that yours is the last 
                    case of the year.  By law, I can t 
                    accept your motions unless you re 
                      simultaneously holding a glass of 
                    eggnog.

      Judge Huff turns to his LAW CLERK, a normally humorless 
      attorney who is suddenly wearing a SANTA HAT.  He s pouring a 
      few glasses of eggnog for the group.

                                  MITCH
                    My mistake.

      As Mitch takes a glass:

                                  JUDGE HUFF
                    McDeere.  I don t believe you ve 
                    appeared in my courtroom before.

                                  MITCH
                    No, Your Honor.  My wife and I just 
                    moved back to the area.

                                  JUDGE HUFF
                    From?

                                  MITCH
                    Memphis.  I was working for a firm 
                    there but... we needed a change.

      The clerk hands a glass to the Judge.

                                  JUDGE HUFF
                    Well on behalf of Boston, sir, 
                    welcome home.  I wish you and your 
                    wife a Happy New Year.  

      As Judge Huff raises his glass, we HEAR A SCHOOL BELL RING 
      and it takes us to:                                                                                      8.



      Abby stands before a class of THIRD GRADE KIDS.

                                  ABBY
                    Alright, let s quiet down.  As you 
                    know, this is a special field trip 
                    for those who signed up over the 
                    break.

                                    STUDENT
                    Mrs. McDeere?  What s the name of 
                    the play again?

                                  ABBY
                    It s called The Nutcracker and it s 
                    a ballet, not a play.
                          (then)
                    The busses are outside.  So let s 
                    line up, single file.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Inside, Abby supervises the kids as they exit.  Finally, she 
      walks to the door.  The tension escalates.  We have the very 
      clear sense that if she steps outside, she will be shot.  We 
      follow to the last moment, when suddenly:

                                    ADMINISTRATOR (O.S.)
                    Abby?

      Abby stops, turns in the doorway.  A school ADMINISTRATOR is 
      there with TWO LARGE MEN in suits.

                                    ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
                    These men are here to see you.

                                  ABBY
                    Sorry, did we have an appointment?

                                  FBI AGENT
                          (flashing a badge)
                    No, Ma am.  But we do need you to 
                    come with us.

      We INTERCUT THE ASSASSIN, waiting on the rooftop.  He can t 
      get a clear shot.  OFF Abby, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Abby rides with her two FBI Agents, concerned:

                                  ABBY
                    I want to stop.  I need to call my 
                    husband.

                                  FBI AGENT
                    No stops.  Your husband s with 
                    other agents.  We re taking you to 
                    him now.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch rides with the other Agents.  He s dazed:

                                  MITCH
                    What happened?

                                  FBI AGENT
                    Car bomb.  It was detonated by 
                    remote at the exact moment you 
                    passed.

                                  MITCH
                    Detonated by who?                                                                                    11.


                                  FBI AGENT
                    Agent Tarrance will explain when we 
                    get you inside.

      The name hits Mitch.  His jaw clenches.

                                  MITCH
                    Tarrance is in Boston?

      No response.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    What about Kevin?  Is he okay?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      On the cut, an ELEVATOR SPRINGS OPEN.  Abby rushes out, 
      followed by her Agents.  Mitch is there, being treated by a 
      PARAMEDIC.  Abby throws her arms around him:

                                  ABBY
                    Oh, God.

                                  MITCH
                    I ll be fine.

                                  TARRANCE (O.S.)
                    You should be dead.

      A tense beat.  They turn to see SPECIAL AGENT WAYNE TARRANCE, 
      forties (Ed Harris in the film):

                                  TARRANCE (CONT'D)
                    Hello, Mitch.  Abby.

                                  MITCH
                    Tarrance.

                                  TARRANCE
                    What happened was a hit.  The order 
                    went out this morning.  We just got 
                    there a little late.

                                  MITCH
                    You re saying there s a contract?  
                    On me?

                                  TARRANCE
                    Not just you.  Both of you.  Your 
                    friend Kevin is dead.  I m sorry.  
                    I need you to follow me.                                                                                    12.


      Silence.  OFF Mitch and Abby, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch and Abby sit opposite Tarrance and FEDERAL MARSHAL 
      LOUIS COLEMAN, mid-thirties.  The CAMERA CIRCLES Mitch and 
      Abby as their world caves in:

                                  TARRANCE
                    The order came from Joey Morolto 
                    himself.  We have people inside who 
                    say there s paper with both your 
                    names on it.

                                  MITCH
                    Then it s a mistake.  What I gave 
                    you incriminated the firm.  Bendini 
                    Lambert and Locke only.

                                  ABBY
                    The firm was overbilling its 
                    clients.  That has nothing to do 
                    with the Mob.

                                  TARRANCE
                    That s true.  But what you gave us 
                    was good.  Maybe too good.

      A beat.

                                  TARRANCE (CONT'D)
                    Six days ago, two Bendini partners 
                    flipped.  They cut a deal with the 
                      Department of Justice.  

                                  MITCH
                    Who?

                                  TARRANCE
                    Oliver Lambert.  Royce McKnight.

                                  MITCH
                    Betrayed Morolto?  No way.  They re 
                    both loyal.

                                  TARRANCE
                    They re both old, Mitch.  They have 
                    nothing to lose, you gave us enough 
                    to put them away for life.

      Mitch absorbs that.  Then:                                                                                    13.


                                  MITCH
                    What are they saying?

                                  TARRANCE
                      Everything.  A lot more than you 
                    ever knew.  The truth about lawyers 
                    who got killed: Hodge and Kozinski,  
                    Robert Lamm, Alice Knauss.  Plus a 
                    tutorial on Morolto s business.

                                  ABBY
                    So why us?  Why not go after them?

                                  TARRANCE
                    Oh, they will.  But this is the Mob, 
                    Abby.  They deal in absolutes, base 
                    emotions.  Anger, Revenge.  You set 
                    in motion a chain of events that 
                    could cripple them.

                                  MITCH
                          (impatiently)
                    So what now?

      Another beat.  Tarrance continues delicately:

                                  TARRANCE
                    Well... obviously, you can t go 
                    home.  You can t go to work.  Your 
                    options are... limited.  
                          (re: Coleman)
                    This is Louis Coleman.  He s a 
                    Federal Marshal with the Witness 
                      Protection Program.

      Mitch is up like a shot--

                                  MITCH
                    We re out of here.

                                  TARRANCE
                    Mitch.

                        MITCHTARRANCE
      Come on, Abby, before this Just listen.  Mitch, come on, 
      genius gets us killed--you need to--

                                  MITCH
                    What?  I need to what, Tarrance?  
                    Trust you?  Six days.  Lambert and 
                    McKnight cut a deal six days ago, 
                    why weren t we told?                                                                                    14.


                                  TARRANCE
                    We didn t know there was a threat 
                    to you until this morning.

                                  MITCH
                    Exactly.  If I learned anything   
                    in Memphis it s that you are always 
                    the last to know.

                                  TARRANCE
                    That s not fair.

                                    COLEMAN
                    Mitch.  Hey, look, we don t know 
                    each other, but you don t want to 
                    walk out of here.

                                  MITCH
                    We ll take our chances.  

                                  TARRANCE
                    And do what?  The hit s been 
                      commissioned.  You walk, we can t 
                    promise to protect you.

      But Mitch is at the door.

                                  MITCH
                    You know, Tarrance?  How come the 
                    only time I believe you is when you 
                    can t promise me something?

      And he s gone, with Abby close behind.  OFF Tarrance, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch heads out, followed by Abby:

                                  ABBY
                    Mitch... will you wait--

                                  MITCH
                            (escalating)
                    We don t need protection, Abby.  
                    We ve come way too far--

                                  ABBY
                    We need to talk about this.

                                  MITCH
                    I ll figure it out.  I just need 
                    time to think--                                                                                    15.


                                  ABBY
                    I have to tell you something.

                                  MITCH
                    We re okay.  Maybe I can reason 
                    with Morolto, and Ray, he knows 
                    people, maybe they can get the 
                    contracts called off--

                                  ABBY
                    I can t run.

                                  MITCH
                    You can.  We can.  We did it 
                    before.

                                  ABBY
                    Mitch, I m pregnant.

      WHOOSH.  All the air leaves the room.  Mitch just stares in 
      silence.  A moment ago, he was ready for anything.  Now, he 
      feels prepared for nothing.  OFF him, knowing their life is 
      about to change forever, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Tarrance and Coleman gather their things.  But after a beat, 
      Mitch and Abby return.  Abby grips his hand tightly.

                                  MITCH
                          (quietly)
                    Okay.  We re listening.

      OFF Tarrance and Coleman, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A small, unimpressive room.  Mitch sits on a flimsy bed 
      watching Dick Clark s New Year s Rockin  Eve.  A KNOCK at the 
      door.  Mitch opens it, cautiously.  Then:

                                  MITCH
                    Great, thanks.  Happy New Year.

      Mitch takes a large PLASTIC BAG, closes the door.  He yells 
      to Abby and we INTERCUT:

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    You hungry?                                                                                    16.



      Abby stands at the sink.  The water runs, but she s frozen, 
      staring into the mirror.  She s been crying.

                                  ABBY
                          (pulling together)
                    Yeah, uh... maybe try Room Service.  
                    Does this place have Room Service?

                                  MITCH (O.S.)
                    Doubt it.  And probably not on New 
                    Year s Eve.

      Abby collects herself, exits to the main room:

                                  ABBY
                    It s getting late.  Maybe one of 
                    the guards could--

      And now she sees: the small TABLE in the room is DECORATED.  
      Pillowcases double for tablecloths.  Two crappy candles are 
      lit.  And there, in the center:

                                  ABBY (CONT'D)
                    How did... that s not...

                                  MITCH
                    Szechuan Beef from Wong Boys.  I 
                    bribed a Marshal, said it was a 
                      tradition.

      Mitch next produces a half-bottle of CHAMPAGNE.  He pours two 
      glasses.  Abby looks wounded.  Finally, Mitch realizes:

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    You... can t drink this, can you...

                                  ABBY
                    I love you.

                                  MITCH
                    Hey.  Hey... we re okay.

      But even Mitch isn t sure tonight.  Abby sinks into him.  
      Slowly, the CAMERA WIDENS.  Mitch and Abby stand together, 
      everything to each other, in the center of the stark room.  
      OFF them, as Dick Clark celebrates a New Year, we:

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    17.


                                        ACT TWO

      OVER BLACK, a TITLE CARD READS:

                                        September, 2011

      As the title card FADES, the number 11 is replaced by a white 
      and pink BIRTHDAY CANDLE shaped like the number 10.  


      On the cut, Mitch LIGHTS the candle.  It sits atop a stack of 
      poorly-made PANCAKES.  The birthday girl, CLAIRE McDEERE, ten 
      years old today and dressed for school, looks unimpressed:

                                  CLAIRE
                    This is my cake?  Dad, you said on 
                    my birthday we could have cake for 
                      breakfast.

                                  MITCH
                    And you can.  That s a cake.  A 
                    pancake is a cake.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (over it)
                    You know, this isn t a courtroom, 
                    Dad.

                                  MITCH
                    I know that.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Oh yeah, then how come I just got 
                    screwed on a technicality?

      Mitch smiles.  Claire is sharp -- maybe even sharper than 
      both her parents, which says a lot.

                                  MITCH
                    It s seven a.m., Claire.  You can 
                    have all the cake you want at your 
                    party tomorrow night.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yeah, well don t worry about it.  
                    I m not even sure I m going.

                                  MITCH
                          (kidding)
                    I know, right?  Presents, cake,  
                    all your friends celebrating your 
                    very existence?  I wouldn t want 
                    any part of that either.                                                                                    18.


                                  CLAIRE
                    I m serious.

      Claire blows out the candle.  Mitch can see something is 
      bothering her.  He takes a seat.

                                  MITCH
                    Okay, so what s the problem?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m stressed out.  I m still new at 
                    this school, you know.

                                  MITCH
                    It s been six months.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Six months is nothing.  I m taking 
                    a big chance here, Dad.  I invited 
                    all the popular kids.

                                  MITCH
                    So?

                                  CLAIRE
                    So it s risky.  What if they don t 
                    come?  I can t handle that kind of 
                    public rejection. 

                                  MITCH
                    Won t happen.  Hey... you re an 
                    amazing kid.  Why wouldn t they 
                    come?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t know.  I try to be cool, 
                    but... people don t give you the 
                    inside dirt when your Mom s a 
                    teacher.

      And now Abby enters.  She overheard that--

                                  ABBY
                    Inside dirt?  You re ten, Claire.  
                    What kind of dirt do you even have 
                    when you re ten?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t know, Mom.  They won t tell 
                    me, that s the point.

                                  MITCH
                          (with a laugh)
                    I gotta run.                                                                                    19.


      Mitch grabs his briefcase.  He kisses Claire on the forehead, 
      then gives Abby a kiss as he heads out.

                                  ABBY
                    Hey, we need to talk.

      She follows Mitch to the door, where Claire can t hear them.  
      She s suddenly more serious.

                                  MITCH
                          (knows why)
                    You went over the books again last 
                    night.

                                  ABBY
                    It s not good, Mitch.  It s been 
                    six months and we can barely pay 
                    for the office space.

                                  MITCH
                    According to Claire, six months is 
                    nothing.

                                  ABBY
                    You have eight clients, half of   
                    which still haven t paid, not that 
                    you even ask them to--

                                  MITCH
                    They will, they just don t have the 
                    money right now.

      Abby just gives him a look.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    Okay, you re right.  I only have 
                    eight good clients, but one of those 
                    eight is Althea Sanderson and she is 
                    a great client with a case that s 
                    about to settle.  Guaranteed.

                                  ABBY
                          (warmly)
                      Guaranteed by who?

                                  MITCH
                    By me.  Six figures by the end of 
                    the week, I promise.  I gotta run. 

      And he s out the door.  Abby just smiles.  She loves 
      everything about him, including his never-say-die optimism.  
      Actually, she may love that the most.  OFF her, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    20.



      TAMMY HEMPHILL, late-thirties (Holly Hunter in the film).  
      Her hair is red today, a constricting black leather skirt 
      hugs her hips and a low-cut top strangles the rest.  She 
      grooves slightly to a desk RADIO quietly playing jazz. 

      This is the Law Office of Mitchell McDeere, not nearly as 
      impressive as it sounds.  It s a store-front, accessible to 
      anyone on the street.  A plate-glass window streaks light 
      across the linoleum floor.  The front room has a desk for 
      Tammy and a few chairs for clients.

                                  MITCH
                          (enters, rushed)
                    Tell me we got an offer on 
                      Sanderson.

      Tammy pops two pieces of NICOTINE GUM in her mouth.

                                  TAMMY
                    Not yet.  Nice of you to show.  
                    I ve been calling.

                                  MITCH
                    It s Claire s birthday.  I had to 
                    make her breakfast.

                                  TAMMY
                    Yeah, well Judge Trott s gonna have 
                    you for breakfast.  His clerk wanted 
                    you there at nine.

                                  MITCH
                    The arraignment s at ten.  Why so 
                    early?

                                  TAMMY
                    She wouldn t say, but it sounded 
                      important.  I told her you were on 
                    your way.                                                                                    23.


      Mitch goes to a stack of mail.  He leafs through it 
      aggressively.

                                  MITCH
                          (honest, concerned)
                    We re in trouble, Tammy.  I don t 
                    know.  I thought I could make this 
                    work, but we re running on fumes.  
                    I need that settlement.

                                  TAMMY
                    It ll happen, honey.

                                  MITCH
                    We need it.  Not just for us, for 
                    Althea and her family.

      He sits on the desk, wheels turning.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    I m telling you.  I m on to 
                      something.  Althea Sanderson didn t 
                    just have a heart attack, the stent 
                    they implanted in her chest was 
                      defective.

                                  TAMMY
                          (no idea what that means)
                      A defective stent.  Those sons of 
                    bitches.

                                  MITCH
                    If I m right, there could be 
                    thousands of plaintiffs out there.  
                    This could be the biggest tort
                    case of the year.

                                  TAMMY
                    Then they ll settle.  I m sure the 
                    last thing they want is a trial.

      Mitch can only hope she s right.

                                  MITCH
                    Where s Ray?

                                  TAMMY
                    The other half of the brothers 
                    McDeere is in your office.  Where 
                    he s staying.  We re not speaking 
                    at the moment.

                                  MITCH
                    Should I even ask why?                                                                                    24.


                                  TAMMY
                          (sharply)
                    Oh, he knows why.

      Mitch considers prying further, but doesn t.  Instead, he 
      makes a bee-line for the only other room they have:


      He OPENS the door to find RAY McDEERE, early forties, inside.  
      Ray s quieter than Mitch, darker, more dangerous.  His temper 
      cost him 15 years in prison for Manslaughter in a bar fight, 
      but that was years ago.  His years in the Army as a language 
      specialist left him fluent in French and German.  He s smart 
      and resourceful, but highly unambitious (a younger David 
      Strathairn in the film).

      Ray has his feet on Mitch s desk.  He watches a TV MONITOR.

                                  MITCH
                    There he is.  The hardest working 
                    private investigator in the city.

                                  RAY
                          (re: the TV)
                    You re gonna love this.

      Mitch knocks Ray s feet off the desk.

                                  MITCH
                    You want me to love something, Ray?  
                    Bring me something on Sanderson, a 
                    witness, a suppressed document, do 
                    some work.

                                  RAY
                    Okay, first of all, there are no 
                      documents.  If the stent s defective 
                    a company like Gentech knows better 
                    than to leave a paper trail.
                          (then)
                    And for your information, I am 
                    working.  I got the video on your 
                    lewdness case.

                                  MITCH
                    Eddie Deebs?

                                  RAY
                    Man, what a prize this guy.  He  
                    exposes himself to some kids from 
                    Saint Augustine at a pizza place 
                    after school.  And what s his 
                    defense?                                                                                    25.


                                  MITCH
                          (knowing it s crazy)
                    He says he had an allergic reaction 
                    to the cheese in the pizza.

                                  RAY
                    Some reaction.

      Ray hits the PLAY button.  We SEE Eddie Deebs in a booth at 
      the pizza joint.  He scopes out a few Catholic School girls, 
      trying to control himself.  Finally, he leaps up and drops 
      his pants, gyrating as he exposes himself.

                                  MITCH
                          (with a laugh)
                    I ll plead it out.
                          (then)
                    Hey, what s new with you and Tammy?

                                  RAY
                    Nothing new.  Same old fight.  
                    She s upset because I didn t ask 
                    her to marry me.

                                  MITCH
                    When, today?

                                  RAY
                    Ever.  I told her, hey look, I got 
                    a fear of commitment.

                                  MITCH
                    You ve been together more than ten 
                    years, Ray.  You went into Witness 
                      Protection with the woman.

                                  RAY
                    Exactly.  I love her.  I m not 
                    going anywhere.  But the big M?  
                    Nah, not my thing.

      Mitch knows better than to argue with Ray.  And he s late.  
      He grabs his trial bag.

                                  MITCH
                    My arraignment s in half an hour.  
                    I m going to the pens first.

                                  RAY
                    Later, bro.

      OFF Mitch, heading out, we HEAR a PRISON DOOR SLAM SHUT and:

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    26.



      The courthouse jail.  These are the  pens  -- a handful of 
      cells adjoining the felony courtrooms.  We FIND MITCH in one 
      with SARAH HUGHES, late-twenties.  Sarah has girl-next-door 
      looks, but she s frayed, exhausted.

                                  SARAH
                          (quietly)
                    You re a defense lawyer?

                                  MITCH
                          (scanning his notes)
                    I m your defense lawyer, Sarah. 
                    Mitch McDeere.  The court appointed 
                    me as of last night.

      Silence.  Sarah looks tired.

                                  SARAH
                    Look... I don t want to be rude, 
                    but... why you?

      The edge in her voice surprises Mitch.

                                  MITCH
                    No reason.  The court has a list of 
                    local lawyers willing to take murder 
                    cases.  I guess my name was up next. 
                    That okay?  

                                  SARAH
                    I can t pay you.

                                  MITCH
                    Don t worry about that.  The State 
                    pays me a discounted rate.

                                  SARAH
                    So you re a discount defense lawyer?

      A tense beat.

                                  MITCH
                    Yes.  Let me tell you what happens 
                    now, Sarah.  When you go out there, 
                    you ll be charged with murder, that 
                    means the government will do every-
                    thing it can, will stop at nothing 
                    to put you away for the rest of 
                    your life.

      Mitch closes his file, deadly serious now.                                                                                    27.


                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    That s who you are.  Me?  I m just 
                    a guy.  A guy who knows first-hand 
                    what it s like when the government 
                    points its finger at you and makes 
                    up its mind.  So I put my name on
                    a list and here I am.

      Another beat.  Sarah just stares.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    Now.  I have questions.  Questions 
                    like why would a twenty-seven year 
                    old insurance broker with a family, 
                    a one bedroom apartment, and a chip 
                    on her shoulder kill a seventy-one 
                    year old woman in her sleep.

                                  SARAH
                          (from her depths)
                      I wouldn t.  I didn t.

      Mitch sizes her up, unsure.

                                  MITCH
                    Okay.  There s no argument on the 
                    merits today.  The Judge ll hear me 
                    on bail and you ll be formally 
                    charged.

                                  SARAH
                    Will he let me go home?  At least 
                    until the trial?

                                  MITCH
                    No.  Not on a murder charge.
                          (a beat)
                    Let s just get through this and 
                    then we ll talk, okay?

      Sarah nods.  Mitch sits for a beat, then heads for the door.  
      But before he goes:

                                  SARAH
                    Mr. McDeere.  Thank you.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      On the cut, Mitch enters from a side door (to the pens).  The 
      room is crowded, filled with lawyers and family members there 
      to watch the Arraignments -- the first time a client or loved 
      one appears before a Judge after an arrest.                                                                                    28.


      Judge Trott presides.  He s mid-fifties, a lanky, kind-faced 
        intellectual who was probably a weak and ridiculed child.  He 
      wears thin glasses, perched high on his nose.  As a new case 
      is called in, Trott spots Mitch:

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    Mr. McDeere.  So nice of you to 
                    join us.  And only forty minutes 
                    after I ordered you to.

      Mitch faces him, awkwardly.

                                  MITCH
                    Sorry, Your Honor.  It s my 
                      daughter s birthday.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    Ah, well.  Then as a gift to her, 
                    I ll refrain from holding her father 
                    in contempt.

                                  MITCH
                    She s ten today, Judge.  I promise, 
                    she holds me in enough contempt for 
                    both of you.

      Trott smiles slightly.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    I just spoke to my client inside.  
                    We re ready when you are.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    Actually, counsel, I wasn t calling 
                    about Ms. Hughes.  I was calling to 
                    assign you a new defendant.  Step 
                    up, please.

      Mitch approaches the bench.  What follows is sotto:

                                  MITCH
                    Your Honor, with the greatest 
                    respect, I m gonna ask you not to 
                    do that.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    I haven t even told you what it is.

                                  MITCH
                            (delicately)
                    I know.  But I just got assigned a 
                    new homicide case last night and... 
                    to be honest, I don t really have 
                    the bandwith for another.                                                                                    29.


      Judge Trott s eyes narrow.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    In other words, you d like to 
                    reserve that bandwith for a fully 
                    paying client.

                                  MITCH
                    Yes.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    Times are a little tough, huh?

                                  MITCH
                    I just started my practice a few 
                    months ago.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    And so far, I ve been impressed 
                    with what I ve seen.  That s why I 
                    thought of you specifically for 
                    this.

      Mitch nods, but doesn t respond.  After a beat:

                                  JUDGE TROTT (CONT D)
                    Tell you what.  Meet with the 
                    client.  Afterward, if you don t 
                    want the case, I ll assign it to 
                    someone else, I promise.

                                  MITCH
                    Your Honor.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    That s the best deal you re gonna 
                    get, counsel.  One meeting and let 
                    me know your decision.

                                  MITCH
                    Yes, sir.  And where can I find 
                    this new client?

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    I just called the case into the 
                    record.  He s standing right there.

      A surprised beat.  Mitch turns back to the defense TABLE.  
      But there s no defendant present.  Instead, all Mitch sees 
      are COURT OFFICERS gathered in the area.  But then:

      The Court Officers step aside.  And finally, through the 
      maze, Mitch sees ANTHONY HEYWOOD, African-American, only 
      THIRTEEN years old, at the table.                                                                                    30.


      Anthony looks scared.  He was arrested yesterday, and he s 
      been in custody ever since.  Most shockingly, his t-shirt and 
      hands are still spattered with some BLOOD. 

      Afraid, Anthony looks back to the gallery, where his father 
      (LAVELL HEYWOOD) watches in fear.

      OFF Mitch, thrown, we finally:

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    31.


                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Mitch is now with Anthony Heywood.  The Court Officers have 
      cleared the surrounding pens to give them some privacy.  From 
      the start, Mitch has trouble reaching Anthony:

                                  MITCH
                    Anthony, my name is Mitch McDeere.  
                    I m an attorney.  First of all, are 
                    you okay?  Are you hurt or... do 
                    you need anything--

                                    ANTHONY
                    I want to talk to my Dad.

                                  MITCH
                    Of course.  I can arrange that, but 
                    first we need to talk for a minute.  
                    You re...
                          (re: the court file)
                      ...thirteen, is that right?

      Anthony nods only slightly.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    So... eighth grade.  You go to 
                    Calvin Coolidge Middle School... is 
                    that where this happened?

                                    ANTHONY
                          (quiet, in shock)
                    I have blood on my shirt.  I need a 
                    new shirt.

                                  MITCH
                    I ll get you one.  The police, 
                    they ll take the one you re wearing 
                    as evidence.

      Another nod.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    Can you... Anthony, I think maybe
                    I can help you.  But to do that, I 
                    need to know a little bit about 
                    what happened.
                          (off his silence)
                    The police... they say you hurt one 
                    of your classmates.                                                                                    32.


                                    ANTHONY
                    Nathan s dead.

                                  MITCH
                    Nathan.  That s right, Nathan 
                    Williams.  Did you know him?  Were 
                    you friends?

      Anthony shakes no.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    You knew him, but you weren t 
                    friends?

      He shakes yes, but says nothing more.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    Okay, let s try this another... the 
                    knife.  Tell me about the knife. 
                    Was it yours?

      Anthony looks away, trying not to re-live what happened.  But 
      he can t escape it.  Finally, he opens up a little:

                                    ANTHONY
                    We were fighting.  I didn t want
                    to, but... when I tried to walk home 
                    after school he was waiting. 

                                  MITCH
                    Why?

                                    ANTHONY
                    I didn t do anything.  We were just 
                    talking, I swear.

                                  MITCH
                    Who was talking?

                                    ANTHONY
                    Me and Hannah.  She s a girl in my 
                    class.  Nathan likes her.  He told 
                    me to stay away from her, but we 
                    were just talking.

                                  MITCH
                    Okay.  So Nathan... he wanted to 
                    fight.

                                    ANTHONY
                    He started pushing me, you know, 
                    telling me things.  So I hit him... 
                    and he had a knife...                                                                                    33.


      The emotion overwhelms him.  He s horrified.

                                    ANTHONY (CONT D)
                    I got it away and I stabbed him.  I 
                    didn t want to...
                          (weakly)
                    I didn t even do anything....

      His voice trails off.  OFF Mitch, drawn in by him, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch is now with Lavell Heywood, forty.  He s not a big guy, 
      but there s a power to him.  His hands are worn from years of 
      work with a roofing company.  He rubs his eyes.

                                  LAVELL
                    A girl.  He killed that boy because 
                    he was fighting over a girl?

                                  MITCH
                    He says it was a misunderstanding.  
                    Anthony didn t want to fight.  He 
                    was protecting himself.

                                  LAVELL
                    Then why d they arrest him?  If it 
                    was self-defense...

                                  MITCH
                    Mr. Heywood, can I ask... does your 
                    son have a knife?  A pocket knife,  
                    ever seen him with one?

                                  LAVELL
                    No.
                          (then, admitting)
                    But if he does, he knows better 
                    than to let me catch him with it, I 
                    promise you that.   

      A beat.  There was a menace to that -- a tone that gives some 
      insight into what Lavell is like when he s angry.

                                  LAVELL (CONT D)
                    Look, I do what I can, but I can t 
                    be on him all the time.  His mother 
                    doesn t want him.  I ve been doing 
                    this alone most of his life.

                                  MITCH
                    And you ve had problems?                                                                                    34.


                                  LAVELL
                    Some.  Anthony s a good kid.  He 
                    just doesn t know what he is yet.  
                    He s not the smartest or the best 
                    looking, or the toughest... Kids, 
                    there s no time to figure things 
                    out anymore.  People need to know 
                    what to make of you.
                          (a beat)
                    Anthony s just a little lost.

      Mitch absorbs that.

                                  LAVELL (CONT D)
                    So what happens now?

                                  MITCH
                    The next step is a hearing.  The 
                      prosecution wants to charge your 
                    son as an adult.

                                  LAVELL
                    He s thirteen.  Can they do that?

                                  MITCH
                    Legally, they can try.  It s my
                    job to convince the Court to treat 
                    him as a Juvenile.
                          (then)
                    I won t lie to you, sir.  That 
                      decision s critical.  As a Juvenile, 
                    the court s goal is to rehabilitate 
                    a child.  As an adult, the goal is 
                    to punish a criminal.

                                  LAVELL
                    On a murder charge, that means 
                      twenty-five to life.

                                  MITCH
                    Yes.

      A somber beat.  At this, a COURT OFFICER approaches:

                                  COURT OFFICER
                      Counselor.  Your arraignment s up.  
                    Judge wants you back.

      Mitch nods, waves him off.

                                  LAVELL
                          (simply)
                    Mr. McDeere, can you help my son?                                                                                    35.


                                  MITCH
                    I ll try.  I work with my brother 
                    Ray, he s a private investigator.  
                    I ll ask him to start right away.

      OFF Lavell, grateful for any hope, we PRE-LAP:

                                  COURT OFFICER (O.S.)
                    Docket ending 9-2-2.  The People 
                    versus Sarah Hughes.  Defendant is 
                    charged with murder.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch returns to the defense table.  Sarah stands nervously 
      before Judge Trott.  The prosecutor, DIANE RUCKEYSER, mid-
      thirties, jumps in with gusto:

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Diane Ruckeyser for the People.  
                    Good morning, Your Honor.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                          (not bright or shiny)
                    Ah, Ms. Ruckeyser.  Bright and 
                    shiny as always.
                          (then)
                    Before we begin... Mr. McDeere.  I 
                    take it you spoke to our young Mr. 
                    Heywood?

                                  MITCH
                    I did, Your Honor.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    And?

                                  MITCH
                    I m in.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                      Wonderful.  So shines a good deed 
                    in a weary world.

      At this, Judge Trott looks into the gallery.  He sees Lavell 
      Heywood returning to a seat in the courtroom.

                                  JUDGE TROTT (CONT D)
                    Mr. Heywood....

      Mitch turns to face Lavell as the Judge calls to him:                                                                                    36.


                                  JUDGE TROTT (CONT D)
                    You re a lucky man, sir.  You ll 
                    find a lot of good human beings in 
                    this courthouse, and a lot of very 
                    talented lawyers.  What you won t 
                    find are many people who are both.

      ANGLE MITCH S POV.  He looks into the gallery toward Lavell 
      Heywood.  And suddenly, someone catches his eye.  At the back 
      of the courtroom, watching by the doors, is ANDREW BECKETT, 
      mid-thirties.  Andrew is balding, with a kind face (think 
      Anthony Edwards).  Andrew NODS to Mitch.  

                                  JUDGE TROTT (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    I think you ve got one here in Mr. 
                    McDeere.  Trust his advice.

      Mitch NODS BACK to Andrew, surprised to see him.  Andrew 
      gestures for Mitch to meet him outside when he s done.  Mitch 
      nods yes, then turns back to the Judge.  OFF Andrew, slipping 
      out of the courtroom, we go:

      CLOSE ON: TWO GLASSES OF premium SCOTCH.  A YOUNG WAITRESS 
      places them on a silver tray and we REVEAL:


      An opulent bar and restaurant near the courthouse.  The 
      waitress delivers the drinks to Mitch and Andrew, now part of 
      the lunch crowd.  As the waitress departs--

                                  ANDREW
                          (charming, likeable)
                    I used to enjoy the fact that the 
                    Scotch I drank was older than the 
                    waitress who delivered it.  Now I 
                    just feel old myself.

                                  MITCH
                          (with a laugh)
                    You re thirty-five, Andrew.

                                  ANDREW
                    I m just saying.  Eleven years ago, 
                    we were third years at Harvard Law 
                    ready to conquer the world.

                                  MITCH
                    And now?

                                  ANDREW
                    Now we re  suits  with thinning 
                    hair who can t stay awake for the 
                    eleven o clock news.                                                                                     37.


                                  MITCH
                    Speak for yourself.
                          (then)
                    And your hair s not thinning.  You 
                    have to have hair for it to be 
                    thinning.

      Andrew laughs, taps his glass against Mitch s:

                                  ANDREW
                    Good to see you Mitch.  How s Abby?

                                  MITCH
                    She s great.  We ve only been in 
                    town a few months.

                                  ANDREW
                    So I hear.
                          (off Mitch s surprise)
                    Hey, Washington may be the center 
                    of the free world, but it s also a 
                    pretty small town.  A new firm 
                    opens up, word gets around.

      Mitch considers that.  Then:

                                  ANDREW (CONT D)
                    So.. catch me up.  Last thing I  
                    remember, you told every major firm 
                    in New York to fuck off and took a 
                    job down South.

                                  MITCH
                    Yeah, that didn t work out.

                                  ANDREW
                    So where you been?

                                  MITCH
                          (covering)
                    You know, we moved around a lot.

                                  ANDREW
                    And criminal law?  Dude, you were a 
                    tax genius.  What s that about?

                                  MITCH
                          (simply)
                    Things change, Andy.
                          (then)
                    So what about you?  I could make a 
                    car payment for the price of this 
                    Scotch.  I guess business is good.                                                                                    38.


                                  ANDREW
                    It is.  Actually, that s why I 
                    arranged this little reunion.

      A beat.  The idea that this was more than a chance encounter 
      surprises Mitch.

                                  ANDREW (CONT D)
                    I m a partner over at Kinross and 
                    Grant.  Maybe you know us.  We re a 
                    small shop, only forty lawyers.

                                  MITCH
                    What kind of work?

                                  ANDREW
                    All civil.  All high-level.  
                    Corporate litigation, bankruptcy, 
                    tax, I-P, Labor, Anti-trust.  We 
                    handle strictly blue chips and we 
                    are one-stop shopping for whatever 
                    they need.  Except... 

                                  MITCH
                    Except?

                                  ANDREW
                    Except criminal.  These days, 
                    someone we represent s always in 
                    trouble with somebody.  SEC, IRS, 
                    the U.S. Attorney--

                                  MITCH
                    And you re coming to me?

                                  ANDREW
                    Up to now, I ve been farming those 
                    cases out.  My partners think maybe 
                    it s time to start a criminal 
                    division in-house.
                          (then)
                    I asked around.  You ve made quite 
                    an impression in just a few months. 
                    And I d rather give the spot to an 
                    old friend--

                                  MITCH
                            (delicately)
                    I don t think so, Andy.

                                  ANDREW
                    Why not?                                                                                    39.


                                  MITCH
                    I just went out on my own.  I m not 
                    really looking to join a firm. 

                                  ANDREW
                    And I respect that.  But we re a 
                    good group.
                          (with charm)
                    Hey, at least come see the place.  
                    You can t drink my Scotch and call 
                    me bald and then pass.

      OFF Mitch, with a laugh, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch and Ray are back at the office.  Tammy is on the PHONE 
      at her desk, writing notes quickly.  Ray hands Mitch a JUNIOR 
      HIGH-SCHOOL YEARBOOK with a PHOTO circled.  A young-looking, 
      lanky, DOUGLAS BREEN smiles for the camera.

                                  MITCH
                    Two kids?

                                  RAY
                    His name s Douglas Breen.  Same age 
                    and grade as your client.

                                  MITCH
                    You talk to him?

                                  RAY
                    I tried.  He only lives a few 
                    blocks from the school so I walked 
                    over to the house.

                                  MITCH
                    How d you get the address?

                                  RAY
                    Let s just say the school Security 
                    Guard and I bonded.
                          (then)
                    I talked to Dougie Breen s father.  
                    He said the U.S. Attorney warned 
                    him someone from the defense might 
                    come by.

                                  MITCH
                    So the prosecution knows he exists.

                                  RAY
                      Definitely.  I asked for an 
                      interview, but the father refused. 
                    Gave me a speech about his legal 
                    rights.  It took a lot of self-
                    control not to hit him.

                                  MITCH
                    The question is, if he was also 
                    running why didn t they arrest him 
                    with Anthony?  They must be using 
                    him as a witness.

                                  RAY
                    Bottom line, bro, the question is, 
                    why d your thirteen-year old client 
                    lie to you?                                                                                    43.


      Mitch knows he s right.

                                  MITCH
                    I don t know.  He never mentioned 
                    Breen.  There must be a reason--

      At this, Tammy HANGS UP THE PHONE.  She interrupts, waving 
      her pen like a cigarette--

                                  TAMMY
                    We got a problem.  First of all, 
                    that conversation lasted forty-two 
                    minutes and I m not equipped to go 
                    that long without a cigarette.
                          (then)
                    Second, that was the Vice Principal 
                    at Coolidge Middle.  He gave me the 
                    history on Anthony Heywood.

                                  MITCH
                    He s thirteen.  How much  history  
                    can he have?

                                  TAMMY
                    Oh, this boy s got a file.  No 
                    serious violence, but he s known to 
                    have issues.

                                  RAY
                    Who doesn t?

                                  TAMMY
                    He s barely passing his classes.  
                      Profanity, threats to students, last 
                    year, he threw a social-studies book 
                    at a female teacher.

                                  MITCH
                          (dreading the answer)
                    And what about the victim?

                                  TAMMY
                    Nathan Williams?  Good student, 
                    good kid.  Maybe not an angel, but 
                    from what I hear, everyone loved 
                    him.  The V-P called his death a 
                       heartbreaking loss. 

      Great.  Not what Mitch wanted to hear.  In frustration--

                                  MITCH
                    Look, I met with Anthony Heywood.  
                    He looked me in the eye and said it 
                    was self-defense.                                                                                    44.


                                  RAY
                    Then maybe it was.

                                  MITCH
                    Or maybe this kid s sharper than I 
                    gave him credit for.

      After a beat, Mitch leaps up.  As he grabs his coat--

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    Let s find out.  Tammy call the 
                    pens, tell them I m on my way.  If 
                    this kid s lying, I ll know by 
                    tonight.

      OFF Mitch, as he blows out the door, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      We re back in Anthony s cell.  Official business is done for 
      the day, so it s quieter.  Mitch stares at Anthony for a long 
      beat, then another.  Finally:

                                  MITCH
                    Let me explain something, Anthony.  
                    I m a defense attorney.  That means 
                    I m here to defend you.

                                    ANTHONY
                    I know.

                                  MITCH
                    No, I don t think you do.  Because 
                    if you did, you d be helping me, not 
                    lying to me. 

      A tense beat.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    You told me this was a fight.  Just 
                    you and Nathan in the yard.  What d 
                    you think?  I d just take your word 
                    for it?  I wouldn t even try to 
                    check that out?

                                    ANTHONY
                    It s true.

                                  MITCH
                          (quiet power)
                    It s not true.  I know about Dougie 
                    Breen.                                                                                    45.


      Silence.  Anthony says nothing.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    I know he was there.  He s a 
                    witness against you.  So you tell 
                    me, when the Prosecutor puts him up 
                    on that stand, how am I supposed to 
                    defend you when I have no idea what 
                    he s gonna say?

      Anthony looks away.  Then, low--

                                    ANTHONY
                    I didn t [muffled response].

                                  MITCH
                    I didn t catch that.

      And now Anthony looks right at Mitch:

                                    ANTHONY
                          (stronger)
                    I said I didn t think he d say 
                    anything.

      Wow.  His words reverberate in the stark cell.

                                  MITCH
                    Everyone deserves a defense, 
                    Anthony.  And I will defend you at 
                    this hearing tomorrow.  But to do 
                    that, I need to know what I m 
                    walking into.

      Anthony considers that.  He suddenly seems older, more 
        calculating.

                                    ANTHONY
                    I wasn t fighting Nathan.  Nathan 
                    had nothing to do with this.

                                  MITCH
                    Then why is he dead?

      A reluctant beat.  Then:

                                    ANTHONY
                    Dougie and I got into it after 
                    school.  It was personal.  Nathan 
                    just happened to see it jump off 
                    and had to get involved.

                                  MITCH
                    Involved how?                                                                                    46.


                                    ANTHONY
                    He pulled me off Dougie.  Told me 
                    to leave him alone.  I told him to 
                    mind his fucking business.
                          (then, remembering)
                    But he wouldn t.  He said he was 
                    making this his business.  So...

      His voice trails off.

                                  MITCH
                    The knife.  It was yours, wasn t it?

      But Anthony never even hears the question.  He s off in his 
      own mind, re-living the murder.  After a long beat:

                                    ANTHONY
                    I warned him.  But Nathan had to be 
                    Nathan.
                          (then)
                    Man, and that kid was supposed to be 
                    smart.  Yeah, look how smart he was.

      He s chilling.  In part, a remorseless killer.  But also a 
      frightened teenage boy trying to justify an unspeakable act 
      so he can live with himself.

      OFF Mitch and Anthony, in silence, we:

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    47.


                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      We re back at the McDeere house, a genuinely warm and 
      inviting place.  Abby stands at the kitchen counter making 
      dinner.  Claire is at the table doing homework.  After a 
      beat, Claire looks up at her mother:

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hey, Mom.  If you had a dollar and 
                    you had to split it between all your 
                    friends, would you want a hundred 
                    pennies or a single bill?

                                  ABBY
                    Why?

                                  CLAIRE
                    What do you mean, why?  It s a 
                    game, just go with it.

                                  ABBY
                    I don t know.
                          (then)
                    I ll take four quarters.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (exasperated)
                    No, it s... you know, I really 
                    think sometimes you want me to have 
                    mental problems.

                                  ABBY
                    Excuse me?

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s a choice, Mom.  You have to 
                    take pennies or a dollar.

                                  ABBY
                    Well, it s ridiculous.  I don t 
                    want to have only one friend.  But 
                    I don t need a hundred either.  I 
                    want four.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (ignoring that)
                    Yeah, well I d take the pennies.  I 
                    think I want to be a people person.

      Abby gets a kick out of that.                                                                                      48.


                                  ABBY
                    Okay, people person, books away, 
                    dinner s ready.  I ll go get your 
                    father.

      With a smile, Abby heads for the HOME OFFICE and we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A small den, converted into the McDeere home office.  Mitch 
      sits at a COMPUTER SCREEN.  He has LEGAL TEXTS and a YELLOW 
      PAD in front of him, but he s not working.

      ANGLE THE COMPUTER: on the screen, we see the website for 
      KINROSS AND GRANT, Andrew s law firm.  The site is modern and 
      polished.  A sleek conference table gleams in photos of a 
      beautiful library.  Suddenly:

                                  ABBY (O.S.)
                    I think we re raising a politician.  
                    Either that or a Cruise Director.  
                    Your daughter wants to be around 
                    people.

      Instantly, Mitch SWITCHES THE SCREEN to conceal the law 
      firm s page.  He goes back to the books on the desk.

                                  MITCH
                    Hey.

                                  ABBY
                    Tell me you got the settlement 
                    offer on Sanderson and we re rich.

                                  MITCH
                    Not yet.

                                  ABBY
                    How s it going?  You worried about 
                    the hearing tomorrow?

                                  MITCH
                          (quiet, reflective)
                    I ve represented plenty of guilty 
                    clients, Abby, but never this young.  
                    You should ve seen him.  This kid 
                    had absolutely no remorse.

                                  ABBY
                    He s thirteen, Mitch.  Even if he 
                    felt it, he probably wouldn t know 
                    how to express it.                                                                                    49.


      Abby goes to Mitch, drapes her arms around him.

                                  ABBY (CONT D)
                    If it helps, there s a lot of new 
                    research for teachers saying teenage 
                    brains are undeveloped.

                                  MITCH
                          (re: the papers around)
                    I ve got it.  An immature pre-
                    frontal cortex.  Some say it lowers 
                      impulse-control, judgment, empathy, 
                      risk-assessment--  

                                  ABBY
                    But you re not buying it.

                                  MITCH
                    Honestly?
                          (a beat)
                    Anthony Heywood stabbed his 
                    classmate in the neck with a pocket 
                    knife.  That didn t happen because 
                    his brain was undercooked.

                                  ABBY
                    Maybe not.  So what now?  Whatever 
                    problems he has, Mitch, they won t 
                    get better in the adult system and 
                    you know that. 

                                  MITCH
                    So every kid s redeemable.  You 
                    really believe that?

                                  ABBY
                    Yes.  And so do you.

      A quiet beat.  Mitch isn t so sure tonight.  Finally: 

                                  MITCH
                    The worst part is, to make their 
                    case, the prosecution has to put 
                    Dougie Breen on the stand.

                                  ABBY
                    So?

                                  MITCH
                    So... to do my job, I have to 
                    destroy a thirteen year old boy 
                    who s telling the truth.

      OFF Abby, we go:                                                                                    50.


      CLOSE ON: the frightened face of DOUGIE BREEN.  He s 
      thirteen, slight, smart but not a classic nerd -- the kind of 
      kid who s lousy at baseball, but loves it and memorizes the 
      stats.  Then PULL BACK TO REVEAL:


      Dougie sits in the WITNESS BOX, which looks massive around 
      him.  All parties are present, including Mitch and Anthony at 
      the defense table.  U.S. Attorney Diane Ruckeyser questions 
      Dougie on direct.  The room is rapt.

                                  DOUGIE
                    It was just supposed to be a joke.  
                    You know, a way for me to get back 
                    at Anthony.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    And when you say Anthony, who 
                    exactly do you mean?

                                  DOUGIE
                    Anthony Heywood.  He s sitting 
                    right there.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    May the record reflect that the 
                    witness has identified the defendant, 
                    Anthony Heywood.
                          (then)
                    And Douglas, how do you know 
                    Anthony?  Is he a friend of yours?

                                  DOUGIE
                    No.  We re in the same class, 
                    but... I m not really cool enough 
                    to be his friend.  He pretty much 
                    only knows who I am because it s 
                    his mission in life to harass me.

                                  MITCH
                      Objection.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    The witness can characterize his 
                      relationship with the defendant--

                                  MITCH
                    The witness can do that without 
                    sarcastic comments about my client s 
                    mission in life.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    Objection sustained.                                                                                    51.


      Ruckeyser decides to move on.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Douglas, you said you were trying 
                    to  get back at  Anthony.  Please 
                    tell us what you mean.

      Dougie s reluctant.  Finally, after a moment:

                                  DOUGIE
                    We read this book in English... 
                    Native Son.  We all had to read it 
                    and write an essay about it.  A few 
                    days before, I heard Anthony saying 
                    in the hall how he really liked it.  
                    How it was the first book he ever 
                    wanted to read. 

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Go on.

                                  DOUGIE
                    The day we got our essays back... 
                    Anthony got his and I saw his face.  
                    I mean, he never gets good grades, 
                    but usually he doesn t care. This 
                    time, he was mad.  When class was 
                    over, he crumpled it up and threw 
                    it away.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    And what did you do?

                                  DOUGIE
                    I got it from the garbage and... it 
                    was stupid, I know, but I put it on 
                    the bulletin board in the hall.

      An awkward beat.

                                  DOUGIE (CONT D)
                    He got an F.  Everybody was 
                    laughing, but I didn t think anyone 
                    knew it was me.  But then... when I 
                    left school, Anthony was waiting...

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    What did he do?

                                  DOUGIE
                    He didn t say much.  He just 
                    started hitting me.  I was on the 
                    ground and... he was kicking me... 
                    that s when Nathan came.                                                                                    52.


                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Nathan Williams.  He was also in 
                    your class?

                                  DOUGIE
                          (getting more emotional)
                    Yeah.  Nathan pulled him off me, 
                    told Anthony to stop.  I could hear 
                    them yelling... and then Anthony 
                    had a knife.
                          (a beat)
                    I saw him stab Nathan... and then he 
                    ran.

      A tense beat.  Ruckeyser lets his testimony ring.  Finally, 
      she yields the floor.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    No further questions.

      Mitch rises.  Behind Ruckeyser in the gallery, he can see 
      RICHARD and KAREN WILLIAMS (Nathan s parents), overcome by 
      grief.  This won t be pleasant.  After a long silence:

                                  MITCH
                    You hated Anthony, didn t you, 
                    Dougie?
                          (off his silence)
                    Come on.  You weren t cool enough 
                    to be his friend and you resented 
                    that.
                          (then)
                    You wanted to humiliate him.  
                    That s why you posted that essay.  
                    To get revenge.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                      Objection.  Does counsel have a 
                    question?

                                  MITCH
                    Here s my question.  How much did 
                    you hate him, Dougie?  How much do 
                    you hate him now?  Enough to lie
                    to this court?

                                  DOUGIE
                    I m telling the truth.

                                  MITCH
                          (stronger)
                    The truth is, you were on the 
                    ground when Nathan attacked my 
                    client.                                                                                    53.


      ANGLE THE CROWD: in the gallery, Richard and Karen Williams 
      stiffen at the suggestion.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                      Objection.  There s no testimony 
                    the defendant was attacked.

                                  MITCH
                    The testimony s unclear, Your 
                    Honor, that s my point.
                          (to Dougie)
                    You said Anthony was kicking you, 
                    correct?

                                  DOUGIE
                    Yeah.

                                  MITCH
                    So you were covering up, weren t 
                    you?  Using your arms to protect 
                    your head and body?

                                  DOUGIE
                    I guess.

                                  MITCH
                    So you never saw what happened.

                                  DOUGIE
                          (pushing back)
                    I heard Nathan come over.  He told 
                    Anthony to stop.

                                  MITCH
                    You heard Nathan, I understand 
                    that.  I also understand you heard 
                    someone say the word stop.

                                  DOUGIE
                    It was Nathan--

                                  MITCH
                    What did he say, Dougie?  What were 
                    his exact words?

      Dougie just stares.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    You don t know.  The fact is, 
                    Nathan s the one who threatened my 
                    client--

                                  DOUGIE
                    I never heard that.                                                                                    54.


                                  MITCH
                          (stronger)
                    Which doesn t mean it didn t 
                    happen.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                      Objection.  Argumentative--

                                  MITCH
                          (powering on)
                    What about the knife, Dougie?  You 
                    said you looked up just in time to 
                    see Anthony stab Nathan?

                                  DOUGIE
                    That s right.

                                  MITCH
                    But you never saw Anthony pull that 
                    knife, did you?
                          (off his silence)
                    The fact is, Nathan pulled that 
                    knife.  Nathan s the one who took a 
                    simple fight and turned it into a 
                    deadly encounter--

                        DOUGIERUCKEYSER
      No.Objection.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    My client was lucky enough to grab 
                    that knife away and use it in self-
                    defense--

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Your Honor, this is outrageous--

      And now, Mitch turns it up another gear:

                                  MITCH
                      Outrageous?  The People are seeking 
                    to treat my client, a thirteen-year-
                    old boy, as an adult--

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Because this was an adult act of 
                      violence--

                                  MITCH
                    Your Honor, this is a child.  If he 
                    created the situation, if he sought 
                    it out and killed because he wanted 
                    to or enjoyed it, they might have 
                    an argument here--                                                                                    55.


                                  RUCKEYSER
                    He was beating a classmate--

                                  MITCH
                    He was responding to a public 
                      humiliation.  And this so-called 
                    murder was in self-defense--

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    That s crap.  Nathan Williams is 
                    the victim here, Your Honor.  His 
                    parents are here in the courtroom 
                    and they deserve--

              RUCKEYSER (CONT D)MITCH
      --better than to sit here   My client s father is also 
      and hear their son being here in the courtroom and he 
        slandered--deserves--

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    Alright!
                          (then, to Mitch)
                    That s enough, counsel.  You ve 
                    made your point.

      Silence.  Mitch stands down.  In the stillness, he turns to 
      see Richard and Karen Williams, devastated by his cross.

                                  JUDGE TROTT (CONT D)
                    I m reserving judgment on the 
                    status of the defendant.  You ll 
                    have my decision in the next few 
                    days.  In the meantime... on the 
                    issue of bail...

      The mention of bail surprises Mitch.  He assumed Anthony 
      would be held until his status was determined.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Your Honor, the People request that 
                    decision be deferred--

                                  MITCH
                    There s no reason to defer.  Mr. 
                    Heywood s here and prepared to take 
                    full responsibility.

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    Fine.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                          (more desperate)
                    Your Honor, please.  This is a 
                    murder charge.                                                                                    56.


                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    And you ll have your day in court.  
                    But I won t hold the defendant like 
                    an adult until I ve decided whether 
                    or not he is one.
                          (then)
                    The defendant is released into his 
                    father s custody.

                                  MITCH
                    Thank you, Your Honor.

      And there you go.  Mitch knows he s done his job well... and 
      he s not happy about it.  OFF Anthony, then Richard and Karen 
      Williams, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      After the hearing, Mitch stands in the court corridor with 
      Lavell Heywood.  We PICK THEM UP as the two men shake hands 
      and part.  As Mitch moves down the hall, he spots Karen and 
      Richard Williams nearby.  As he goes past them, Karen can t 
      contain her anger.  As she approaches--

                                  KAREN
                          (with quiet power)
                    Shame on you, Mr. McDeere.

      Mitch stops, thrown.  Richard tries to stop her--

                                    RICHARD
                    Karen.

                                  KAREN
                    You didn t know my son.

                                  MITCH
                    Mrs. Williams.  I m an attorney.  
                    I m a defense attorney.

                                  KAREN
                            (escalating)
                    No.  An attorney argues facts.  He 
                    doesn t say whatever needs to be 
                    said so his client goes free.

                                    RICHARD
                    Come on, let s not do this...

      He tries to pull her away.                                                                                    57.


                                  KAREN
                    Let go of me.
                          (then, to Mitch)
                    Nathan was a beautiful boy.  He was 
                    good.  He died trying to help some-
                    one, but you don t care.

                KAREN (CONT D)MITCH
      My son never had a knife, he Mrs. Williams, I am so sorry 
      could never kill--for your loss--

                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                    No, no.  Don t you tell me you re 
                    sorry.
                          (low, from her depths)
                    What if it was your child?

      She s shaking, lost.  Richard holds her.  She fights for a 
      moment, but then gives in.  He pulls her away, leaving Mitch 
      in the hall.  As they go, Richard and Mitch hold a look.  We 
      can see the hurt and sense of helplessness in Richard s eyes.  
      OFF Mitch, standing in silence, we finally:

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    58.


                                        ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:


      Mitch stands on a small STEP-LADDER at a BOOKSHELF.

      We hear sounds of the party outside.  Mitch holds a copy of 
      NATIVE SON, which he found sitting on a top shelf.  After a 
      beat, Abby enters.  She watches him, then:

                                  ABBY
                    What cha got there?

      Mitch looks up.  He shows her the cover: the silhouette of a 
      young black man staring down at his open hands.

                                  ABBY (CONT D)
                    Native Son.  A classic, but... 
                    maybe a little heavy for a ten-year-
                    old s birthday.

                                  MITCH
                    You know it?

                                  ABBY
                    I taught it.  Not for awhile, but it 
                    was required reading at my school in 
                    Boston.  Why?                                                                                    59.


                                  MITCH
                    Anthony Heywood.  It made an 
                      impression.  It s the only book he 
                    ever wanted to read. 

                                  ABBY
                    It s about growing up poor and 
                    black in 1930s Chicago.

                                  MITCH
                    Guess he could relate to the 
                    journey.

                                  ABBY
                    The journey and now the ending.  
                    The lead character can t escape his 
                      circumstances.  He ends up going
                    to prison for murder.

      Mitch absorbs that.  After a somber beat:

                                  MITCH
                    You re right.  A little heavy for a 
                    birthday party.

                                  ABBY
                          (with a smile)
                    Come on, I need your help with the 
                    cake.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch stands at the counter.  He puts ten CANDLES on an 
      enormous BIRTHDAY CAKE, a feat of engineering with pink and 
      white icing.  There s MUSIC playing and Mitch can HEAR the 
      girls having fun outside.  As he works, we:

      ANGLE MITCH S POV.  He glances out the KITCHEN WINDOW, which 
      looks out on the street in front of the house.  And suddenly, 
      something catches his eye:

      A CAR IS PARKED across the street, some distance from the 
      house.  In the street light, Mitch can just make out the FORM 
      OF A MAN in the driver s seat.  His dark shadow is perfectly 
      still.  OFF Mitch, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The same cake, but most of it s gone.  The party s over.  
      Mitch and Abby survey the mess: plastic cake plates and torn 
      wrapping paper, etc.  Mitch swipes a finger into the last of 
      the cake and falls into a chair opposite Abby:

                                  MITCH
                    You know, I don t think I ve ever 
                    seen Claire this happy.

                                  ABBY
                    Yeah.  It makes no sense.  How did 
                    two of the most independent-minded 
                    people on the planet give birth to 
                    such a... joiner?                                                                                    61.


                                  MITCH
                          (with a laugh)
                    Speaking of which... I was gonna 
                    tell you this before, but I already 
                    knew what you d say.

                                  ABBY
                    Uh oh, that s never the start of a 
                    good conversation.

                                  MITCH
                    It s not a big deal.

                                  ABBY
                    Let me guess.  It s about that 
                    firm.  The one you looked up on the 
                    computer.

                                  MITCH
                          (surprised)
                    Oh, you saw that.

                                  ABBY
                    I teach fifth graders, babe.  You 
                    don t move half as fast as they do.

                                  MITCH
                    Like I said, it s not a big deal.  
                    I ran into Andrew Beckett at the 
                      courthouse.  You remember--

                                  ABBY
                    Andrew Beckett from law school?

                                  MITCH
                    He asked about you.  Sends his best.

                                  ABBY
                    And he works at that firm?

                                  MITCH
                    It s called Kinross and Grant.  
                    Forty lawyers, all high-end civil 
                    cases.

                                  ABBY
                          (concerned)
                    Did he ask where you ve been?

                                  MITCH
                    He asked.  Don t worry, he didn t 
                    know anything about Memphis.  And 
                    he didn t want to talk about the 
                    past.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    62.

                                  MITCH (CONT'D)
                          (then)
                    His partners want to start a 
                    Criminal Division at his firm.  He 
                    offered me the job.

      Abby considers that.  As expected, she s against the idea, 
      but she stays low key:

                                  ABBY
                    And you turned him down.

                                  MITCH
                    Yes.
                          (then, admitting)
                    But... he made me promise to think 
                    about it.  And he wants us both to 
                    come see the office.

                                  ABBY
                    Mitch.

                                  MITCH
                    I knew you wouldn t like the idea.

                                  ABBY
                    We just started a firm.  Your own 
                    firm.

                                  MITCH
                    And I told him that.

      An awkward beat.  They re on the same page.  But Abby s sharp 
      enough to sense there s more to this.

                                  ABBY
                    But you re telling me because... 
                    there s something about it that 
                    interests you.

                                  MITCH
                    Maybe.

                                  ABBY
                    Why?  Mitch, you re not built for 
                    those firms.  People who do well at 
                    firms have a pack mentality.

                                  MITCH
                    I get that.

                                  ABBY
                    Then help me understand.  Why would 
                    you want to be part of that--                                                                                    63.


                                  MITCH
                    I don t know.  Maybe because I 
                    never was.  Maybe because I m the 
                    son of a coal miner and a waitress, 
                    not a bank president and a 
                    socialite like you--

                                  ABBY
                    So what, you need to be around 
                    entitled people, to make yourself 
                    feel worthy--

                      MITCHABBY
      It s not about worth--Then what--

                                  MITCH
                    It s about potential.  It s about 
                    being someone, being relevant.

      A quiet beat.  Then, softer:

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    Look.  I was top-of-my-class at 
                    Harvard.  I wanted things.  I wanted 
                    to do things that mattered, make law 
                    that mattered.  That was taken from 
                    me, taken from us.

      The PHONE RINGS at the house.

                                  ABBY
                    You can do it on your own.

      The PHONE RINGS again.

                                  MITCH
                    And I will.  I guess there s just 
                    part of me that still wonders--
                          (snatching the phone)
                    Hello?
                          (then)
                    Tammy.  Hey, can I call you back 
                    we re right in the middle--
                          (a beat)
                    Okay, take it easy.  About what?  
                    No, no, no.  You stay there.  I m 
                    on my way.

      Mitch hangs up.

                                  ABBY
                    Tammy s still at the office?                                                                                    64.


                                  MITCH
                    She never left.  She said someone s 
                    there to see me.  Someone I need to 
                    talk to now.

      OFF Abby, then Mitch on the move, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch arrives to find Tammy waiting at the door.  She unlocks 
      it, ushering him in.  The office appears empty:

                                  MITCH
                    You okay?

                                  TAMMY
                          (quickly)
                    I was here with Ray.  I ve been 
                    trying to stay angry at him but God 
                    knows I cannot stay mad at that boy.  
                    We were...  making up  and he just 
                    walked in the door.

                                  MITCH
                    Where is he?

                                  TAMMY
                    In your office.  Don t worry,  
                    Ray s watching him.

      Mitch shoots a look toward his office door.

                                  TAMMY (CONT D)
                    I told him he needed to make an 
                      appointment.  He said no, he had to 
                    talk to you right away.

      OFF Mitch, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      On the cut, Mitch enters his office.  Ray is at the desk, 
      leaning back, contemplating what he s just heard.  Sitting 
      opposite him is an UNKNOWN MAN, thirties.  He s a powerful 
      guy, not physically huge but ripped.  The top of an unseen 
      TATTOO creeps along the side of his neck.

                                  RAY
                    Hey, bro.  Sorry to call, but you 
                    need to hear this for yourself.                                                                                    65.


      The Unknown Man stands.  Ray does the introductions:

                                  RAY (CONT D)
                    Derek Little, this is Mitch 
                    McDeere.  Okay, Derek, tell him 
                    what you just told me.

                                  DEREK
                    You re McDeere?  Anthony Heywood s 
                    lawyer?

      Mitch didn t expect to hear Anthony s name.  He replaces Ray 
      behind his desk and sits.  Ray moves off to the side.

                                  MITCH
                    This is about Anthony?

                                  RAY
                    Derek works for Allway Supply.  
                    It s a small construction company 
                    owned by Richard Williams.

                                  MITCH
                    Nathan s father?

                                  DEREK
                    Mr. Williams came to see me today.  
                    Told me about his kid getting killed 
                    and how you twisted things--

                                  MITCH
                    Look, Derek.  I don t know what 
                    you re doing here--

                                  DEREK
                    He said the kid who did it was 
                    gonna walk.  The judge just let him 
                    go home or something.  He s taking 
                    it hard.

                                  MITCH
                      I understand that, but--

                                  DEREK
                          (stronger)
                    No, I don t think you do.  He 
                    offered me ten thousand dollars to 
                    kill your client.

      Whoosh.  A rush of adrenaline shoots through Mitch.  A 
      stunned beat.  Then, finally:

                                  MITCH
                    When did this happen?                                                                                    66.


                                  DEREK
                    A few hours ago.

                                  MITCH
                    And why d he come to you?

                                  DEREK
                          (flatly)
                    Because some people are 
                      uncomfortable around violence.  I 
                    don t happen to be one of those 
                    people.  I ve done some things
                    and he knows that.

                                  MITCH
                    Why come to me?

                                  DEREK
                    Because I had to do something.  
                    Look, I like the man.  He s been 
                    good to me.  So I m sure as hell 
                    not going to the police.
                          (then)
                    But every man draws his own line.  
                    And mine is this: I don t kill 
                    kids.

                                  RAY
                    Good line.

                                  DEREK
                    I think so.  Problem is, not 
                    everyone shares my moral values.  
                    If I don t do it, he ll find 
                    someone who will.

                                  MITCH
                    You thought he was serious?

                                  DEREK
                    I m here, aren t I?
                          (then)
                    I talked to the man.  I looked in 
                    his eyes.  It won t be over for him 
                    until Anthony Heywood is dead.

      OFF Mitch and Ray, in shock, we:

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    67.


                                        ACT SIX

      FADE IN:


      The group has gathered back at the house.  Signs of Claire s 
      party still litter the kitchen.  Abby pours a cup of coffee.  
      Ray sits on the kitchen counter, swinging his legs casually.  
      Mitch and Tammy are at the table.  With urgency--

                                  ABBY
                    Richard Williams hired a hitman?

                                  MITCH
                    He s not a hitman, he s an   
                    employee -- a construction worker.

                                  RAY
                      A construction worker open to 
                    killing people, he just prefers 
                    they be old enough to vote.

                                  TAMMY
                          (explaining to Abby)
                    He doesn t kill kids.  Heart-
                    warming, right?

      Abby s speechless for a moment.

                                  MITCH
                    It s crazy.  Richard Williams is 
                      forty-three.  The man runs his own 
                    company.  He s got a wife and a 
                    daughter.

                                  RAY
                    An eight year old daughter.

                                  MITCH
                    Most guys his age from where he
                    grew up?  They ve been arrested half 
                    a dozen times.  He has no criminal 
                    record.

                                  ABBY
                    Meaning what, you don t think he d 
                    go through with it?

                                  MITCH
                          (ruefully)
                      Meaning... he s a good man.  It 
                    took a lot of desperation to make 
                    him even consider it.                                                                                    68.


      A quiet beat.  Abby picks up on the tone in his voice.  She 
      can tell that he feels partly responsible.

                                  ABBY
                    Hey.  You did not drive him to 
                    this.  You had a legal obligation 
                    to defend your client and I don t 
                    need to tell you that.

      Mitch just nods.  She s right, but that s little consolation 
      now.

                                  TAMMY
                          (bad under pressure)
                    Can I smoke in here?

                      MITCHABBY
      No.No.

                                  RAY
                    The question is, what are we 
                    dealing with?  An angry father who 
                    shot off his mouth in a moment of 
                    rage or a serious threat?

                                  ABBY
                    How can we know that?

                                  TAMMY
                    We can t.

      But then, something clicks for Mitch:

                                  MITCH
                    Maybe we can.  Derek told Richard 
                    he needed time to decide.  They re 
                    meeting in the morning.

                                  TAMMY
                    So?

                                  MITCH
                    So maybe we keep the meeting.  
                    Maybe Derek won t do the job, but 
                    he recommends someone who will.

      Mitch POINTS to Ray.

                                  RAY
                    Oh, and because I m the only one 
                    with a Manslaughter conviction and 
                    prison time, you automatically 
                    think of me.
                          (then)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    69.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                    Just kidding.  I think it s 
                      brilliant.

                                  TAMMY
                    Can we really do that?

                                  MITCH
                    Damn right.  Richard Williams is
                    a decent guy.  We re not going to 
                    the cops until we know if he s
                    for real.

      They all exchange looks, agreed on the plan.  Then, suddenly, 
      Claire ENTERS THE KITCHEN.  They immediately stop talking -- 
      and Claire senses that something is wrong.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What s going on?

                                  ABBY
                    Nothing, honey.  It s late, you 
                    need something?

      Claire s eyes narrow.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (suddenly upset)
                    No... no, no, no.  You cannot do 
                    this to me again!

      Claire storms out the door.

                                  MITCH
                    I ve got her.

      And Mitch follows after Claire, exiting out to the:


      Mitch trails after Claire:

                                  MITCH
                    Hey.  You want to tell me what that 
                    was about?

                                  CLAIRE
                          (wheeling on him)
                    Why?  You never tell me anything.
                          (then)
                    I m not stupid, Dad.  I know what s 
                    going on.

                                  MITCH
                    Claire.                                                                                    70.


                                  CLAIRE
                    All four of you?  Whispering in the 
                    kitchen in the middle of the night?  
                    I ve seen it before.  We re leaving 
                    aren t we--

                                  MITCH
                    Nobody s leaving--

                                  CLAIRE
                          (ignoring that)
                    You can t do this.  We just got 
                    here.  I like it here.  I finally 
                    have friends--

                                  MITCH
                    Okay, first of all, you ve always 
                    had friends.  And second, if you ll 
                    take two seconds to breathe, you ll 
                    be extremely relieved because we re 
                    not leaving.

      A beat.  Claire stares back at him.  Reluctantly, she takes a 
      deep breath.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    This is our home.  That s not 
                    changing.  We were discussing a 
                    problem I m having at work.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You promise?

                                  MITCH
                    I promise we re done running.  
                    Okay?

      The relief floods over her.  In a rare display of 
      vulnerability, she throws her arms around him and hugs as 
      hard as she can.  OFF this, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      And now we FIND MITCH sitting in his car, positioned so he 
      can SEE INTO the windows.                                                                                    71.


      Mitch puts on a small EARPIECE with a MICROPHONE:

                                  MITCH
                    Can you hear me?

      Instantly, we INTERCUT TO:


      The CAMERA FINDS RAY at a booth in the corner.  He scans the 
      crowded restaurant, then looks out the window to where Mitch 
      is watching:

                                  RAY
                      Affirmative.  We are all systems 
                    go, little brother.

      The AUDIO CRACKLES a little too much.

                                  MITCH
                    You broke up a little on that.

                                  RAY
                    Damn, hang on.
                          (adjusting his mic)
                    This isn t my equipment.  I traded 
                    a guy for a couple of designer suit 
                      knockoffs.

                                  MITCH
                    Where did you get -- you know what, 
                    don t even tell me.

      At this, Mitch sees Richard Williams approach the Burger 
      King.  As he enters--

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    He s here.  Ray, you sure you can 
                    handle this?

      But it s too late now.  In the restaurant, Ray gives a casual 
      WAVE to Williams.  Williams sizes him up, then approaches the 
      booth.

                                  RAY
                          (icy cool)
                    Mr. Williams?

                                    RICHARD
                    You re Derek s friend?  The one who 
                    called?
                          (off Ray s nod)
                    I told you, I prefer to talk at the 
                    office.                                                                                    72.


                                  RAY
                    This is my office.

      Williams considers that.  He s not a criminal -- just a 
      wounded father out of his league.  Reluctantly, he sits.

                                  RAY (CONT D)
                    Derek told me about the work you 
                    need done.  He s not up to the job, 
                    but he thought maybe we could help 
                    each other.

                                  WILLIAMS
                          (nervously)
                    Can you do it?

      A tense beat.

                                  RAY
                    I don t know you, Mr. Williams.  
                    But from what I ve heard, you re a 
                    decent man.  So before we continue 
                    this conversation and we both say 
                    things we can t take back...
                          (simply)
                    This thing you want done... walk 
                    away.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    I can t do that.

                                  RAY
                    Yes, my friend.  You can.  Your 
                    son s case isn t over.  Let the 
                    system-- 

                                  WILLIAMS
                    To hell with the system.

                                  RAY
                    Derek says you have a family that 
                    needs you. 

                                  WILILAMS
                          (lashing out)
                    You want to know about my family?  
                    I got up today and sent my daughter 
                    to school -- the same school where 
                    my son was killed.
                          (with quiet power)
                    My daughter walks the yard where  
                    he died every day.  And the boy who 
                    killed him was sent home like it 
                    never happened--                                                                                    73.


                                  RAY
                    I just think--

                                  WILLIAMS
                    I don t give a damn what you think.  
                    You can t help me?  Fine.  I ll find 
                    someone who can.

      Williams stands to go.  We quickly JUMP BACK TO Mitch in the 
      car.  He barks into the mic--

                                  MITCH
                    You can t let him go.  Ray, he 
                    needs to say it.  Do not let him 
                    leave--

      Ray quickly adjusts--

                                  RAY
                    Okay, okay.  Hey, take it easy.  
                    I ll do it.  

      Williams stops.  After a beat, he sits again.

                                  RAY (CONT D)
                    How do you want it done?

      Silence.  It s a question Williams hadn t considered.  He 
      thinks for a long moment.  Then, finally:

                                  WILLIAMS
                          (resolved)
                    With a knife.  You kill him the 
                    same way he killed Nathan.

                                  RAY
                    The deal was ten grand.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    You ll get it.  Here.  Same time 
                    tomorrow.

      And without more, he s gone.  With a look of both heartbreak 
      and deep resolve, Williams heads for the door.  As he exits:

                                  RAY
                    You get all that, bro?

      We PICK UP MITCH in the car.  With great sadness, he watches 
      Williams leave the restaurant.

                                  MITCH
                    Yeah.  Well, I guess we know he s 
                    for real.                                                                                    74.


                                  RAY
                    So what now?

                                  MITCH
                    I don t know.  I ve got a meeting 
                    downtown.  I ll call you as soon as 
                    I m out.

      Mitch grabs the DIGITAL RECORDER by his side and hits PLAY.  
      The chilling words we heard earlier hang in the air:

                                  RAY RECORDING
                    How do you want it done?

                                  WILLIAMS RECORDING
                    With a knife.  You kill him the 
                    same way he killed Nathan.

      As the conversation plays, the CAMERA PUSHES IN CLOSE on the 
      recorder.  Then, we PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are now:


      Mitch is driving with Abby.  The recording finishes:  

                                  RAY RECORDING
                    The deal was ten grand.

                                  WILLIAMS RECORDING
                    You ll get it.  Here.  Same time 
                    tomorrow.

      The recording ends.  Abby is stunned.

                                  ABBY
                    You have to go to the police.

      Mitch doesn t respond.

                                  ABBY (CONT D)
                    Mitch, you heard him.  The man is 
                    unstable.  What if he does it?  What 
                    if people find out that we knew--

                                  MITCH
                    They won t.
                          (then)
                    Look, he s not killing anyone.  He 
                    thinks he made a deal with Ray.  We 
                    have until tomorrow to figure out 
                    what to do.

      They ride for a beat.  Then:                                                                                    75.


                                  ABBY
                    What does Ray think?

                                  MITCH
                    I don t know.  We said we d talk 
                    later.

                                  ABBY
                    Did you tell him why?

                                  MITCH
                    I said I had a meeting downtown.  I 
                    didn t want to get into it.

                                  ABBY
                    Because you knew he wouldn t 
                    approve.

                                  MITCH
                    It s just a meeting, Abby.

                                  ABBY
                      I understand.  And that s why I ll 
                    go--

                  ABBY (CONT D)MITCH
      --and I will even smile--It s just a meeting.

                                  ABBY (CONT D)
                    Because I love you.
                          (then, deadpan)
                    A lot.

      OFF Mitch, who can t help cracking a smile of his own, we go:

      CLOSE ON ANDREW BECKETT, beaming:

                                  ANDREW
                    Abby!

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch and Abby stand in the firm s lobby.  Andrew  
      approaches, excited to see them both.  Abby musters that 
      smile she promised and hugs him hello.

                                  ABBY
                    Andrew.  Wow, look at you... and 
                    look at this place, this is really 
                      beautiful.

      And now the CAMERA takes in the lobby:                                                                                    76.


      It s exactly the opposite of a stuffy law firm.  No sterile 
      marble flooring or mahogany paneling.  There s a light, airy, 
      modern feel -- chrome and glass, splashes of color.

                                  ANDREW
                    Let me guess.  You expected more 
                    mahogany and marble.

                                  ABBY
                    I think so.  You know, shadows and 
                    leather and at least one gargoyle.

                                  MITCH
                          (with a laugh)
                    We were a little scarred by our 
                    last firm experience.

                                  ANDREW
                    Well, I tried to tell you.  Things 
                    are different here.  Come on, I ll 
                    give you a tour.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The CAMERA tracks Andrew as he shows Mitch and Abby the  
      firm.  It has the feel of one large workspace -- a communal 
      warehouse vibe, brimming with activity and energy.  Private 
      offices are along the outside walls, with a BULLPEN for 
      PARALEGALS and ASSISTANTS in the center.

                                  ANDREW
                    It was built for us about eight 
                    years ago.  It s not exactly Google 
                    but we try to be progressive.  Our 
                    Managing Partner wanted to bring a 
                    little of that tech inspiration to 
                    the legal world.

                                  MITCH

                    Alex Grant.  She runs our corporate 
                      litigation team.

                                  ABBY
                    She?

                                  ANDREW
                    Brilliant woman.  You know the 
                    saying, this is not your father s 
                    law firm?  Actually, it is.                                                                                    77.


      Andrew swings past the firm s DAY CARE CENTER.  A group of 
      CHILDREN play happily.

                                  ANDREW (CONT D)
                    We ve got the soul of a family 
                    firm, but Alex really took us to 
                    the next level.  We re not happy 
                      practicing law.  We want to make 
                    law and we do that in every area 
                    but criminal.  That s why you re 
                    here, buddy.

      Andrew grabs Mitch by the shoulder, laying on the charm a 
      little thick.  Behind him, Abby makes a goofy face at Mitch, 
      who tries not to laugh.

                                  ANDREW (CONT D)
                    And this... would be your office.

      Andrew guides Mitch and Abby into the:


      It s exquisite.  Abby s not making any faces now.  The room 
      is spacious and beautifully furnished.  The view includes a 
      glimpse of the majestic dome of the Capitol Building.

                                  ABBY
                    Look, honey.  It s exactly like 
                    your office now.
                          (then)
                    How many lawyers do you have?

                                  ANDREW
                    Forty.  But only twenty partners.  
                    Mitch would be twenty-one.
                          (checking his watch)
                    Come on.  We re having a small 
                    reception for a few clients.  I ll 
                    introduce you.

      OFF Mitch and Abby, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A COCKTAIL RECEPTION underway.  A few dozen LAWYERS mingle 
      with upscale CLIENTS in the modern meeting hall.  As Mitch 
      and Abby arrive with Andrew, we BEGIN A BRIEF MONTAGE:

      * Mitch and Abby meet several attorneys and clients.
      * Mitch walks with two glasses of wine, brings one to Abby.
      * Abby listens as a BLOWHARD LAWYER pontificates.                                                                                    78.


      The MONTAGE ENDS as Andrew brings Mitch and Abby to meet  
      ALEX GRANT, forties, the firm s Managing Partner.  There s a 
      manic charisma about Alex, something subtly wild in her eyes.  
      She s either supremely confident or a little dangerous -- 
      think Tilda Swinton at her most dynamic.

                                  ANDREW
                    Mitch and Abby McDeere, this is 
                    Alex Grant.

                                  ALEX
                    Of course, no introduction 
                      necessary.
                          (to Mitch)
                    I know we haven t met, but after 
                    Andrew s report I feel like I know 
                      everything about you.

                                  MITCH
                          (drawn in by her energy)
                    Really.

                                  ALEX
                    Don t worry, it was all glowing.  
                    And Abby, welcome.

                                  ABBY
                    So nice to meet you.

                                  ALEX
                    I heard you had one hell of a 
                    hearing.  Your case, with the young 
                    boy who was killed.  Word is, you 
                    can  cross  with the best.

                                  MITCH
                    Well...

                                  ALEX
                    Don t be modest.  Some people, they 
                    never relax in a courtroom.
                          (then, remembering with 
                            nostalgia)
                      I remember my first time in front 
                    of a jury.  It was a drunk driving 
                    case.  I still remember walking in, 
                    seeing the Judge on the bench and 
                    the jury watching.  My God, I was
                      petrified.

                                  MITCH
                    The first client s always scary, 
                      especially if he s innocent.                                                                                    79.


                                  ALEX
                    Oh, I was the client.  And I   
                    wasn t innocent.  Did beat the case 
                    though... and I ve been comfortable 
                    in a courtroom ever since.

      Alex LAUGHS.  Mitch and Abby exchange quick looks, not sure 
      what to make of her.  OFF this, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch now stands with Andrew and BRADLEY HALVERSON, mid-
      thirties, handsome, a bankruptcy lawyer probably born in a 
      crisp blue shirt with a white collar.  An hour has passed.  
      Outside, the sun is starting to set.

                                    BRADLEY
                    So, Mitch.  I wanted to ask you 
                    about your tax law background.

                                  MITCH
                    What about it?

                                    BRADLEY
                    Well, maybe you could help me   
                    out.  I ve got some clients taking 
                      aggressive positions. 

                                  MITCH
                      Aggressive meaning they re risking 
                    an audit?

                                    BRADLEY
                    All my clients are risking an 
                    audit.  Aggressive means they re 
                    risking indictment.

      A beat.  Mitch shoots a surprised look to Andrew.

                                  ANDREW
                    Now, Brad--

                                    BRADLEY
                    Maybe I could send the files over, 
                    you could take a look--

                                  MITCH
                    I m not sure that s a great idea--

                                    BRADLEY
                    Why not?  Andrew says you were 
                      brilliant--                                                                                    80.


                                  MITCH 
                    Because I m done helping rich 
                    people hide their money.  Andrew 
                    should ve mentioned that.

      An awkward beat.  Bradley backs off.  In the silence, Mitch 
      looks across the room to Abby, who s talking with some other 
      PARTNERS.  He nods toward the door -- wanna get out of here?  
      Abby nods back, ready to go, and we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch and Abby are back home.  Mitch pulls off his tie and 
      unbuttons his shirt, lost in thought.  Abby enters:

                                  MITCH
                    It s getting late.  We need to 
                    decide what to do about Richard 
                    Williams.

                                  ABBY
                    You call Ray?

                                  MITCH
                    He and Tammy are on their way.

      A quiet beat.  Then:

                                  ABBY
                    You know, I have to say.  It 
                    could ve been a lot worse.  They 
                    seemed like nice people.

                                  MITCH
                          (with humor)
                    Yeah, hobbies include: teenage 
                    drunk driving and tax fraud.

                                  ABBY
                    Hey, you asked for it.  The big 
                    players have big personalities. 

      Mitch goes to her, puts his arms around her.

                                  MITCH
                    Yeah, well... that s not what I 
                    want.

                                  ABBY
                          (unconvinced)
                    Really.  So that office didn t 
                    speak to you at all.                                                                                    81.


      He kisses her neck.

                                  MITCH
                    Terrible office.  Unsightly, 
                    really.  Embarrassing...

      He stops, then looks right at her -- so much love and 
      determination in his eyes.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    I just hope we can make it on our 
                    own.

                                  ABBY
                    We will.

                                  MITCH
                    You love this house.  If we don t 
                    start making some money soon...

                                  ABBY
                    Then we ll downsize.
                          (then)
                    Hey, I followed you into Witness 
                      Protection, so don t start acting 
                    like I m high-maintenance.

      She playfully pushes him onto the bed, jumps on top of him.  
      He fights for a beat, then:

                                  MITCH
                    No, Mrs. McDeere, you are... 
                    exactly the right amount of 
                      maintenance.

      He KISSES her.  They laugh, having fun for a moment.  Then, 
      as we watch, the CAMERA RISES and floats to the WINDOW.  And 
      suddenly, we get a shock:

      SOMEONE IS WATCHING THEM from outside!  We don t see his face 
      in the shadows.  After a beat:


      It s early.  Mitch stands at the counter, looking out the 
      window.  He checks the spot where he saw the mysterious car, 
      but finds nothing.  A cup of COFFEE and the WASHINGTON POST 
      sit in front of him.

                                  ABBY (O.S.)
                    You okay?

      Mitch turns to see Abby enter, dressed for work.  He goes 
      back to reading the paper:

                                  MITCH
                    I m fine.

                                  ABBY
                    Mmm hmm.  Tell me three things 
                    about the story you re reading.

      Mitch is busted.

                                  MITCH
                          (quietly)
                    You know, Louis warned me about 
                    fathers and sons.  He said you mess 
                    with that bond, anything can 
                    happen.

                                  ABBY
                    You really think the bond s any 
                    different with a daughter?

                                  MITCH
                    Maybe not.
                          (honestly)
                    I d probably do the same thing if 
                    something happened to Claire.

                                  ABBY
                    I d like to think you wouldn t 
                    solicit a murder.

      But Mitch isn t so sure right now.  He goes to the table and 
      sits for a beat.  Then:

                                  MITCH
                    The tape destroys him, Abby.  He 
                    has no defense.  If we turn it over 
                    to the police--                                                                                    83.


                                  ABBY
                    We talked about this last night.

                                  MITCH
                    It s not just solicitation.  If   
                    he shows up today with the money 
                    that s an Overt Act.  They can 
                    charge him with conspiracy.
                          (then)
                    We re sending him to prison for at 
                    least a few years.

                                  ABBY
                    Hey, we are not sending him 
                    anywhere.

      Another beat.  Mitch knows she s right, but it s in his DNA 
      to keep pushing for a hidden solution.

                                  MITCH
                    There has to be another way to 
                    handle this.  I just don t see it 
                    yet.

                                  ABBY
                    If you don t report it and 
                    something happens to Anthony... 
                    could you live with that?

                                  MITCH
                    No.

                                  ABBY
                    Could you be prosecuted?

                                  MITCH
                    Possibly.  I wouldn t technically 
                    be an accessory, but if the truth 
                    came out... at the very least I d 
                    be disbarred.

      At this, Mitch s CELL PHONE RINGS.  He grabs it:

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                          (to Abby)
                    It s Tammy.
                          (answering)
                    Hey...

      And instantly, we INTERCUT TO:


      CLOSE ON: Tammy at her desk, adrenaline racing:                                                                                    84.


                                  TAMMY
                          (hushed, excited)
                    It s here.  That offer you ve been 
                    waiting for?  It just walked in.

                                  MITCH
                    On the Sanderson case?

                                  TAMMY
                    There s a lawyer here from Gentech.  
                    He came down to deliver it in 
                    person.

      And now the CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL: GREG BOLSON, mid-
      thirties.  He s slick, manicured: a walking achievement in 
      the art of grooming.  He holds a MANILA ENVELOPE with the 
      settlement offer.

                                  TAMMY (CONT D)
                          (sotto, on phone)
                    That s a good sign right?  It s 
                    probably too much money to send in 
                    the mail.

                                  MITCH
                    Just keep him there.

      Mitch HANGS UP.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                          (a bit stunned)
                    Sanderson offer s in.

                                  ABBY
                    Any good?

                                  MITCH
                    I don t know.  Let s go find out.

      OFF Mitch and Abby, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Minutes later, Mitch and Abby arrive, moving quickly.  As 
      they enter, Mitch goes directly for Bolson.  Ray and Tammy 
      are also there.  The two men shake hands:

                                  MITCH
                    Mitch McDeere.

                                  BOLSON
                    Greg Bolson.                                                                                    85.


                                  MITCH
                    Thanks for coming.  We were 
                    expecting an offer, but I didn t 
                    think Gentech would send someone  
                    in person.

                                  BOLSON
                    Oh, I don t work for Gentech.  Ms. 
                      Sanderson s case is no longer being 
                    handled by in-house counsel.  I m 
                    with Cromwell and Taft, maybe you 
                    know us.

                                  RAY
                          (surprised)
                    Cromwell and Taft s the biggest law 
                    firm in D.C.

                                  BOLSON
                    Second largest in the country.  But 
                    you know... who s counting?  My firm 
                    was retained to handle the trial.

      A tense beat.  Mitch stays composed, forces a smile:

                                  MITCH
                    Assuming there is a trial.  I was  
                    under the impression you came down 
                    to offer a settlement.

                                  BOLSON
                    That s true.

                                  MITCH
                    Why don t we talk in my office.

      Mitch starts to move, but--

                                  BOLSON
                    That won t be necessary.

      Mitch stops.

                                  BOLSON (CONT D)
                    I work for Martin Vance.  Mr. Vance 
                    is our Managing Partner and he runs 
                    corporate litigation for our office.  
                    He sent me personally to explain our 
                    offer.  This morning, Mr. Vance was 
                      instructed by Gentech to draft you a 
                    letter stating that the company has 
                    no intention of settling this case.  
                    To the contrary, we fully intend to 
                    try the matter.                                                                                    86.


                                  MITCH
                          (anger building)
                    Then why are you here?

                                  BOLSON
                    Mr. Vance wanted me to tell you 
                    that he bills Gentech at a rate of 
                    eight hundred dollars an hour.  He 
                    felt it would take about one hour 
                    of his time to draft the letter I 
                      mentioned.
                          (extending the envelope)
                    He d rather not.  Instead, he s 
                    offering you the eight hundred as a 
                    courtesy, in full satisfaction of 
                    your frivolous case.

      Mitch s blood is boiling now.  He shoots a look to Abby and 
      then to Ray.  His jaw clenches.

                                  RAY
                    You should leave now.

                                  BOLSON
                    It would be a great mistake to 
                    pursue this any--

                                  MITCH
                    I assure you, Mr. Bolson, the 
                    mistake would be to underestimate 
                    what I m capable of.  What we re 
                    capable of.

      Bolson considers that.  Then, simply:

                                  BOLSON
                    We have 120 lawyers in D.C. alone.  
                    Last year, we billed over thirty-six 
                    million dollars on a dozen complex 
                    tort litigations.  The simple fact 
                    is: this is what we do.
                          (then)
                    You?  You re an office of one 
                    lawyer.  And from what I can find, 
                    you haven t handled a case that so 
                    much as made the local penny-saver 
                    in the last ten years.

                                  MITCH
                    We ll fight you on this.

                                  BOLSON
                    No.  I don t think you will.                                                                                    87.


                                  ABBY
                          (interjecting)
                    Why not?

                                  BOLSON
                    Because I m standing in an office 
                    that six months ago was being used 
                    to sell rental cars.
                          (then)
                    You have a good day.

      And Bolson is gone.  Mitch and the others watch him go in 
      silence.  Finally, after a long beat:

                                  MITCH
                          (incredulous)
                    Eight hundred dollars.

                                  TAMMY
                    I don t understand.

                                  ABBY
                    How can Gentech not settle?  If 
                    that stent is defective--

                                  MITCH
                          (strong)
                    It is defective.  Althea Sanderson 
                    was almost killed by a defect in a 
                    cardiac stent designed by Gentech.  
                    And she s not the only one.  Other 
                    people may already have died--

                                  ABBY
                    Then why risk a trial?  It doesn t 
                    make sense.  If we convince a jury, 
                    it creates a precedent.  They re 
                    looking at hundreds of millions in 
                    damages.

                                  RAY
                    And if they pay us off, they look 
                    guilty.  It s like admitting to the 
                    entire legal world they have 
                    something to hide.

      At this, Mitch takes off toward his office.  His anger and 
      frustration are boiling over--

                                  ABBY
                    Mitch--

                                  MITCH
                    I just need a minute to think.                                                                                    88.


      The others watch as Mitch storms into the:


      Mitch paces.  Abby follows him in.  This all flows quickly:

                                  ABBY
                    Hey--

                                  MITCH
                    He s right, Abby.  Lawsuits take 
                    money.  We need experts, research, 
                    the discovery alone could take a 
                    year.  We can t afford our own 
                    office space--

                                  ABBY
                    Then we figure something out.  You 
                    always figure something out.

                                  MITCH
                          (amazed)
                    Cromwell and Taft.
                          (then)
                      I finished fifth in my class at 
                    Harvard.  Four people were ahead of 
                    me.  Two of them went to Cromwell 
                    and Taft.

                                  ABBY
                    So what, we just give up?

      That STOPS Mitch.  He looks at her for a surprised beat.  
      Mitch never considered giving up.  He s just thinking it 
      through, finding an angle.

                                  MITCH
                    Give up?  I don t want give up, 
                    Abby.  I want to grind those smug 
                    sons of bitches into ground  
                    fucking glass.

                                  ABBY
                    Then let s do it.

                                  MITCH
                    We need lawyers.  Resources.  The 
                    kind of backing you only get from a 
                    major firm.

      And now Abby realizes what he means:

                                  ABBY
                    You re talking about Andrew.                                                                                    89.


      Mitch just nods.

                                  ABBY (CONT D)
                    If that s what you want, you know 
                    I m with you.

                                  MITCH
                    Give me a chance to make it work.  
                    I have an idea.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Ray and Tammy are there.  On the cut, Mitch blows out of his 
      office and heads for the door--

                                  RAY
                    Hey, bro, where you going--

                                  MITCH
                    I ll be back.

                                  RAY
                    You can t leave.  We re supposed to 
                    meet Williams in an hour--

                                  MITCH
                    I should make it.  I ll meet you 
                    there.  

      And Mitch is gone.  OFF Ray and Tammy, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


        A beautiful, sleek room with a view.  Mitch sits at the 
      conference table, opposite Andrew Beckett.  Mitch is nervous 
      but does his best to appear calm as Alex Grant enters.

                                  ALEX
                    Well, well.  Mr. McDeere.  I m so 
                    pleased our little shindig didn t 
                    scare you off.

                                  MITCH
                    Not at all.

                                  ALEX
                    Andrew tells me you re interested 
                    in our offer.  How wonderful.  I ve 
                    always wanted a Criminal Division 
                    at the firm.                                                                                    90.


                                  ANDREW
                    Mitch does have a few... ideas 
                    about how the relationship would 
                    work.  I thought you two should 
                    talk directly.

      Alex sits.  She and Andrew look to Mitch, expectantly:

                                  MITCH
                    Well, first let me say... I 
                      appreciate you coming to me.  I ve 
                    asked around and your firm--

                                  ALEX
                    What do you want, Mitch?

      Her tone surprises him.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    You love us and we love you.  I 
                    think we re done blowing smoke at 
                    this point, don t you?

      Another beat.

                                  MITCH
                    I just started a firm.

                                  ALEX
                    I m aware of that.  Our firm will 
                    acquire your practice and move you 
                    in-house.

                                  MITCH
                    Yes.  But what if I don t want to 
                    move in-house?  What if I want to 
                    maintain my own office and staff?

                                  ALEX
                    Not an option.

                                  MITCH
                    Then I ve wasted your time.  
                    Because it s the only option I ll 
                    consider.

      Alex just stares for a beat.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    I m not looking to be folded into 
                    your firm, Ms. Grant.  I m looking 
                    for an  Association .  You give me 
                    your resources... and I give you a 
                    piece of my business.                                                                                     91.


                                  ALEX
                    We project an image here, Mitch.  
                    One our clients have come to expect.

                                  MITCH
                    Meaning?

                                  ALEX
                    Meaning our lawyers don t do 
                    business out of store-fronts with 
                    linoleum floors.

                                  MITCH
                    Fair enough.  If you provide the 
                    space, I ll meet your clients here.  
                    But my office stays open.

                                  ALEX
                    And your cases?  What exactly would 
                    we be inheriting?

      And now Mitch smiles a bit.  He knew this moment was coming 
      and he s ready for it:

                                  MITCH
                    I thought we were done blowing 
                    smoke.
                          (then)
                    Look.  I m a good lawyer.  On my 
                    best day, maybe better than good.  
                    But this city s filled with good 
                    lawyers.  I know why I m here.

                                  ALEX
                    Enlighten me.

                                  MITCH
                    Althea Sanderson.  Her case is a 
                    winner.  If it s handled right, it s 
                    the biggest tort case of the year, 
                    maybe the next few years.  So...

                                  ALEX
                          (flatly)
                    So we want sixty percent.

                                  MITCH
                    Forget it.  I found the case.  My 
                    team did the groundwork.

                                  ALEX
                    Yes.  And that s all you can do.  
                    We both know you can t go to trial 
                    without us.                                                                                    92.


                                  MITCH
                    I ll give you forty percent.

                                  ALEX
                    Then we really are done here.
                          (standing)
                    You were wrong, Andrew.  He wasn t 
                    ready.

      Alex moves toward the door.  After a beat:

                                  MITCH
                    Fifty.

      Alex STOPS.

                                  ALEX
                    Let me be clear.  If we do this, 
                    you report to me on all your cases.  
                    I am your boss from this day 
                    forward.

      Mitch nods, absorbing that reality.  Finally:

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                      Congratulations.  Your firm just 
                    became  associated  with the best 
                      litigation house in town.  Andrew 
                    will send the papers.

      And Alex is gone.  Mitch stands in silence for a beat, 
      knowing he just made a huge decision.  OFF him and Andrew, 
      true partners now, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CLOSE ON RAY: once again in the booth where he met Richard 
      Williams.  Ray looks concerned: where the hell is Mitch!?  He 
      looks out the window for Mitch s car, but sees nothing.  It s 
      tense.  He speaks into his microphone:

                                  RAY
                    Mitch.  Mitch, can you hear me?  
                    Where are you?

      But it s too late.  Ray SEES Williams enter the restaurant.  
      Williams approaches the booth and sits.

                                  WILLIAMS
                          (all business)
                    You decided to show.  I assume that 
                    means we have a deal.                                                                                    93.


      Ray starts to answer, when suddenly--

                                  MITCH (O.S.)
                    I m here.

      ANGLE THE WINDOW: as Mitch s CAR FINALLY ARRIVES OUTSIDE.  
      He s in the same position as before.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    Sorry, bro.  I m ready.  Stick with 
                    the plan.

      Ray stays perfectly cool:

                                  RAY
                          (to Williams)
                    You got the money?

      Williams reaches into his jacket pocket.  He removes an 
      ENVELOPE with the TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS and slides it across 
      the table to Ray.

                                  RAY (CONT D)
                    You realize once I take that--

                                  WILLIAMS
                    We ve been over this.  Do we have a 
                    deal or not?

      Resigned, Ray opens the envelope.  He SEES THE CASH inside.  
      It s a sad moment.  Finally, he simply says:

                                  RAY
                    No.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    No?

      But Ray doesn t explain.  Instead, he just stands and heads 
      for the door.

                                  WILLIAMS (CONT D)
                    Hey.  Hey--

      But Ray keeps moving.  In seconds, he s gone.  And suddenly, 
      there s a VOICE behind Williams:

                                  MITCH (O.S.)
                    It s over, Mr. Williams.

      Williams turns to:

      FIND MITCH standing at the booth.  The CAMERA PUSHES IN CLOSE 
      on Williams as his world caves in.                                                                                    94.


      Williams is FROZEN -- his mind can t compute how Mitch could 
      be there.  Dazed, he sinks back into his seat.

      Mitch sits opposite him.  He removes his DIGITAL RECORDER and 
      hits PLAY:

                                  RAY RECORDING
                    How do you want it done?

                                  WILLIAMS RECORDING
                    With a knife.  You kill him the 
                    same way he killed Nathan.

      Mitch STOPS the recording.  He doesn t have to say anything.  
      Williams is already a beaten man.  They sit in silence for a 
      long beat.  Then:

                                  WILLIAMS
                    What was I supposed to do?  The 
                    Judge just let that boy go home.

                                  MITCH
                    It wasn t over.  There s still a 
                    chance Anthony could be tried as an 
                    adult.

                                  WILLIAMS
                          (defiant)
                    Well, I wasn t willing to take that 
                    chance. 

      More silence.

                                  MITCH
                    So you threw everything away.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    Please.

                                  MITCH
                    We tried to help you.  We begged 
                    you to let it go, to trust the 
                    system--

                                  WILLIAMS
                    But nothing happened.  I didn t 
                    hurt anyone--

                                  MITCH
                          (stronger)
                    It doesn t matter.  You conspired
                    to commit murder.  That charge alone 
                    carries a maximum of twenty five 
                    years.                                                                                    95.


      That hits Williams hard.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    You could help me.

                                  MITCH
                    No.  Not without risking my career 
                    or maybe getting arrested--

                                  WILLIAMS
                            (escalating)
                    Just listen.  I made a mistake.  
                    But it s done.  Nobody has to hear 
                    that recording.  Nobody needs to 
                    know this happened.

                                  MITCH
                    I see.  So now you want me to  
                    twist the truth.  Now you want me 
                    to decide what did or didn t 
                    happen.

      It s a harsh irony.  Williams is reeling.  His desperation is 
      mounting--

                                  WILLIAMS
                    My family...

                                  MITCH
                    You should ve thought of them 
                    before.

      Williams is lost, broken.  He would cry, but all his tears 
      are long gone.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    I don t expect you to understand.  
                    My wife won t get out of bed.  My 
                    daughter won t eat, she has these 
                    dreams about Nathan...
                          (then)
                    I didn t do this because I forgot 
                    to think of my family, Mr. McDeere.  
                    I did this because they re all I 
                    think about.

      Mitch stays composed.  He can see how much Williams is 
      hurting, but what can he do?  Suddenly, his CELL PHONE RINGS.  
      Grateful for the escape, Mitch grabs it and answers:

                                  MITCH
                    Mitch McDeere.
                          (a beat)
                      I understand, thank you.                                                                                    96.


      He HANGS UP.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                          (to Williams)
                    Judge Trott s reached a decision on 
                    Anthony Heywood.  He wants everyone 
                    in court.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    When?

                                  MITCH
                    Now.

      OFF Williams, then Mitch, we finally:

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT SEVEN                                                                                    97.


                                      ACT EIGHT

      FADE IN:


      All parties are present.  Mitch stands at the defense table 
      with Anthony Heywood.  Lavell Heywood sits behind them in the 
      gallery.  At the prosecution table, A.U.S.A. Diane Ruckeyser 
      gives a supportive nod to Richard and Karen Williams nearby.  
      The room is silent, waiting for Judge Trott to enter. 

                                    ANTHONY
                          (sotto, covering his fear)
                    Are we gonna win?

                                  MITCH
                    I don t know.  Whatever happens, 
                    Anthony, we still have a trial to 
                    get through.

      Judge Trott enters from his chambers.  He takes the long walk 
      to the bench and sits.  There s a weight and formality to the 
      moment, but when Trott finally speaks, he takes a disarmingly 
      casual tone:

                                  JUDGE TROTT
                    I don t have kids.  Maybe it 
                    doesn t matter.  I certainly take 
                    great pains most of the time not to 
                    let my personal opinions shape my 
                    legal ones.

      Judge Trott looks to Richard and Karen Williams:

                                  JUDGE TROTT (CONT D)
                    But in a case like this, I find 
                    myself grateful.  Grateful that I 
                    can only imagine what it must be 
                    like to stand here having lost a 
                    child.

      And now to Lavell Heywood:

                                  JUDGE TROTT (CONT D)
                    Or knowing your child could be 
                    lost... to a criminal system from 
                    which some never return.
                          (a beat)
                    Let me be clear.  This was a 
                    shocking crime of great violence.  
                    Mr. Heywood with both malice and 
                      aforethought went looking for a 
                    fight that afternoon.                                                                                    98.


      The CAMERA FINDS Dougie Breen in the gallery.

                                  JUDGE TROTT (CONT D)
                    He did this, I believe, while 
                    carrying a weapon.  A knife.  He 
                    had that knife because he thought 
                    he might need it.  He thought he 
                    might use it.  And he did use it, 
                    without hesitation and to brutal 
                    effect.  It s hard to think of a 
                    more Adult act.
                          (a beat)
                    That said, this situation was not 
                    entirely of Mr. Heywood s making.  
                    He was, on some level, responding 
                    to a very real humiliation... and 
                    he lashed out, much as you might 
                    expect from a child.
                          (then)
                    So what now?  The truth is, I want 
                    to believe in Mr. Heywood.  I want 
                    to believe he hasn t gone from us, 
                    that there remains something in him 
                    worth trying to save, that he might 
                    benefit from something more than 
                    the punishment that awaits him in 
                    the adult system.

      Judge Trott stops, considers his words.

                                  JUDGE TROTT (CONT D)
                    But it s not that easy.  In fact, 
                    it s incredibly hard because I don t 
                    know how to value Anthony Heywood s 
                    life without de-valuing Nathan 
                    Williams  death.
                          (a beat)
                    To Nathan s parents... I can only 
                    pray you understand how deeply this 
                    court respects your loss.  But I ve 
                    made my decision... and it s one of 
                    hope.  Hope that one day this young 
                    boy will be even a fraction of the 
                    man your son already was.
                          (then)
                    The court rules Anthony Heywood to 
                    be a Juvenile Offender.  And we are 
                      adjourned.

      The GAVEL FALLS.  The room reacts.  Judge Trott is quickly up 
      and out of the courtroom.

      Overcome with relief, Lavell Heywood embraces his son.  And 
      for the first time, Anthony shows genuine emotion in return.                                                                                    99.


      For his part, Mitch is stone-faced.  Like Judge Trott, he 
      wants to believe in Anthony.  But he s not watching Anthony 
      now.  Mitch turns to see Richard and Karen Williams holding 
      each other, devastated by the decision.

      ANGLE RICHARD WILLIAMS.  He and Mitch hold a look, knowing 
      this is the critical moment.  Will Mitch turn him in?  Diane 
      Ruckeyser is just steps away, gathering her things at the 
      Prosecution table.  Finally, Mitch approaches her:

                                  MITCH
                    Diane.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                      Congratulations.  I can live with 
                    losing.  I hope you can live with 
                    winning.

                                  MITCH
                    We need to talk.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    About what?  Even if he s found 
                      delinquent now, he ll be out in 
                    less than five years.

                                  MITCH
                          (from his depths)
                    Diane, please.  I need your help.

      A beat.  Even without hearing why, Ruckeyser can see that 
      something is wrong.  OFF her, we finally:

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      Richard Williams approaches the door.  Behind him, in the 
      KITCHEN, we can SEE Karen pouring herself some tea.  She s 
      not watching as Richard OPENS the door and comes face-to-  
      face with the Officers.                                                                                  100.


                                    OFFICER
                    Richard Williams?

      Williams freezes.  Behind him:

                                  KAREN
                    Richard?  Who s at the door?

                                  WILLIAMS
                          (calling back)
                    It s nothing.  It s someone from 
                    work.

                                    OFFICER
                    I m sorry, sir, but I need you to 
                    come with us.

                                  WILLIAMS
                          (somberly)
                    May I have a moment?

      The Officer nods.  Quietly, Richard closes the door and 
      returns to the kitchen.  Karen has just taken a seat at the 
      table with her tea.  Richard stops, watching her for a beat.  
      Is this the last time he ll be with her like this?  Finally, 
      he steps forward and kisses her forehead:

                                  WILLIAMS (CONT D)
                    I have to run to the office, babe.  
                    I won t be long.

      And without more, Williams goes.  He exits the house and 
      joins the Officers, who escort him to their car.  As they 
      place him inside, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The Officer leads Williams down a long corridor.  He s 
      wearing handcuffs now.  The Officer guides Williams to a 
      Conference Room door and orders him inside. 


      Williams enters.  Inside, he FINDS Mitch and Ruckeyser 
      waiting.  They sit at a table, deadly serious now.  Another 
      attorney, HENRY CLAY, is there.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Mr. Williams...  I understand you 
                    were just given a chance to speak 
                    with Mr. Clay?                                                                                  101.


      Williams nods yes.

                                  RUCKEYSER (CONT D)
                    Mr. Clay is a defense attorney.  
                    You understand that my office has 
                    arranged for him to represent you 
                    at this meeting?
                          (another nod)
                    And that s acceptable to you?

                                  WILLIAMS
                          (weakly)
                    Yes.

      A tense beat.  Then:

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Before we begin, I need to know 
                    that Anthony Heywood is safe.  If 
                    you made any other attempt--

                                  WILLIAMS
                    No.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    He s under our protection as we 
                    speak.  But if you approached any 
                    other individual--

                                  WILLIAMS
                    I didn t.

                                  HENRY CLAY
                    It s the truth, Diane.
                          (then)
                    And let me say, my client deeply 
                    regrets his behavior.  He s willing 
                    to cooperate in any way he can.

      Another beat.  Ruckeyser and Mitch exchange a look.  Then, 
      resolved:

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Fine.  He can sign a confession and 
                    plead guilty to the charge.

      That s a bomb.

                                  HENRY CLAY
                          (thrown)
                    Excuse me?

      Ruckeyser reaches for a LEGAL BINDER.  She removes a few 
      DOCUMENTS and slides them to Clay.                                                                                  102.


                                  RUCKEYSER
                    This is the official complaint.  It 
                    charges your client with conspiracy 
                    to commit murder.
                          (then, to Williams)
                    This document is a plea agreement.  
                    You need to sign it.

                                  HENRY CLAY
                    Now wait a second--

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    No deals.  He takes the top count.  
                    He also needs to write a full 
                      confession.

      Clay feels ambushed--

                                  HENRY CLAY
                    What the hell s going on, Diane?  
                    You called me.  I thought you wanted 
                    to talk.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    We are talking.

                                  HENRY CLAY
                          (standing)
                    Then this meeting is over.

                                  MITCH
                          (with power)
                    Sit down, Henry.

      Silence.  Clay looks to Mitch, confused.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    Diane and I have been talking...  
                    not talking, working to find the 
                    best possible solution here and
                    I think we ve found it.

                                  HENRY CLAY
                    By making him plead to the top 
                    count?

                                  MITCH
                    Just hear her out.
                          (to Williams)
                    You walk out of this room, Mr. 
                    Williams, you are going to prison. 
                    I promise you that.

      A long beat.                                                                                  103.


                                  HENRY CLAY
                    Fine.  Assuming my client does what 
                    you ask, what happens then?

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    I file the complaint and the plea 
                      agreement.
                          (a beat)
                    In my bottom drawer.

      And now Clay understands.

                                  HENRY CLAY
                    You re not going to charge him?

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Not for now.
                          (to Williams)
                    Mr. Williams, you and I will have a 
                    standing appointment.  You will come 
                    to my office once a week for as long 
                    as I say.

                                  WILLIAMS
                          (thrown)
                    Why?

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    So you never forget, not for one 
                    second, that I m watching you.  You 
                    can tell me about your family, your 
                      daughter... I don t know what we ll 
                    talk about, but you will come see 
                    me every week.
                          (a beat)
                    And let me be clear.  If you do 
                    anything to make me nervous, if you 
                    so much as jaywalk, I will file that 
                    complaint and your confession and I 
                    will put you away for a very long 
                    time.  Understand?

      Williams is quietly overcome.  Even Clay is moved.

                                  HENRY CLAY
                    Thank you, Diane.

                                  RUCKEYSER
                    Don t thank me, Henry.  Mitch is 
                    the one who pushed for this.
                          (to Williams)
                    He convinced me that you deserve 
                    another chance, Mr. Williams.  Do 
                    not make me sorry.                                                                                  104.


      Williams looks to Mitch.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    You...

      Both men fight to contain their emotion.

                                  MITCH
                    Sign the papers, Mr. Williams.  And 
                    go back to your family.

      Williams turns to Clay, who nods his approval.  OFF him, then 
      Mitch and Diane, we finally:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      As daylight just begins to fade, we FIND Mitch back at the 
      office.  Tammy and Ray are with him.  Tammy s jazz station is 
      on low in the b.g.  At the end of an impossibly long day, she 
      can t help grooving just a little.

                                  TAMMY
                    So they re not gonna charge him?

                                  MITCH
                    Not officially.
                          (then)
                    Diane took a risk.  The deal she 
                    made... if it s legal, it s right 
                    on the edge.  If it went public,
                    it might end her career.

                                  RAY
                    So how d you convince her?

                                  MITCH
                    She s got three kids of her own.  
                    She knows what it would mean for 
                    them to lose their father.

      They all consider that.  Then:

                                  TAMMY
                    Well, as long as we re on the 
                    subject of secret deals... maybe 
                    you can explain this.

      Tammy reaches under her desk.  She removes a HUGE CARDBOARD 
      BOX filled with legal files.

                                  TAMMY (CONT D)
                    It came for you about an hour ago.                                                                                  105.


      And now Tammy holds up a LETTER:

                                  TAMMY (CONT D)
                    It s got about a dozen files.  And 
                    it came with a hand-written letter 
                    from one Ms. Alex Grant.
                          (reading)
                    Dear Mitch.  Welcome aboard -- with 
                    two exclamation points -- on behalf 
                    of the firm, let me say how excited 
                    we all are to have a new partner -- 
                    two more exclamation points. 

      She stops, nauseated by the letter s enthusiasm.

                                  MITCH
                    Yeah... about that.

                                  RAY
                    You joined a firm.  You didn t 
                    think that was something Tammy and 
                    I should know about?

                                  MITCH
                    Okay, first of all, I didn t join 
                    anything.  It s an association--

                                  TAMMY
                    It says partner.
                          (to Ray)
                    Does it not say partner?

                                  MITCH
                    Okay, technically, yes, I am a 
                    partner.  But nothing else changes--

                        RAYTAMMY
      I can t work at a firm--Neither can I--

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                          (stronger)
                    You guys, nobody has to work at a 
                    firm.  We keep our own office.  Our 
                    own staff.  We re just  associated  
                    with Kinross and Grant.
                          (off their looks)
                    Hey, it was either that or shut 
                    down.  You got a better idea, I m 
                    all ears.

      Ray and Tammy exchange a look.  Sadly, they don t.

                                  RAY
                    What does Abby say?                                                                                  106.


                                  ABBY (O.S.)
                    Abby s on board.

      They all turn to see Abby at the door.  She looks great, 
      dressed in a black suit.

                                  ABBY (CONT D)
                    I admit, I wasn t at first.  But 
                    I m coming around.

                                  TAMMY
                          (flatly)
                    I m telling you now, I m not 
                    kissing any asses.

                                  MITCH
                    Fair enough.  Ray?

                                  RAY
                    Hey, you know me, bro.  I always 
                    got your back.  

      Mitch smiles at that.

                                  ABBY
                          (to Mitch)
                    You ready to go?

                                  MITCH
                    Yeah.  I just need to make a quick 
                    stop on the way.

      Mitch grabs his jacket and heads for the door.  But before he 
      goes, he turns back one last time:

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                          (seriously)
                    Hey.  I want you to know something.  
                    I love you guys.
                          (then, cracking)
                    With three exclamation points.  
                      Seriously.  Three.
                          (mouthing)
                    Three!

      And he s out the door with Abby.  OFF Ray and Tammy, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch now walks down a quiet hospital corridor.  These 
      patients aren t receiving urgent emergency care, they re 
      parked here for the long-term.  Mitch arrives at a ROOM     
      at the end of the hall.

      ANGLE MITCH S POV: a hand-written sign is taped on the glass 
      window.  It names the patient inside as: A. SANDERSON.  This 
      is Althea Sanderson, Mitch s star client.  From the door, we 
      can see that Althea is in a COMA, breathing with the help of 
      a ventilator.

      Next to the bed is Althea s daughter, CAROLINE SANDERSON, 
      only nineteen.  She sits quietly in a chair, keeping her 
      mother company.  When she SEES MITCH, her face brightens.  
      She goes to the door.

                                  CAROLINE
                    Mr. McDeere.  I didn t know you 
                    were coming.

                                  MITCH
                          (re: Althea)
                    How s she doing?

                                  CAROLINE
                    She s still fighting.

                                  MITCH
                          (simply)
                    So are we.

      OFF Caroline, then Althea Sanderson holding on, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Andrew is at his desk.  He places the document in a LEATHER 
      FOLIO and carries it with him as he exits to the:


      The CAMERA tracks Andrew as he moves through the dark firm.  
      Almost everyone is gone.  Finally, he enters the:


      We ve been here before.  Now, a small meeting is beginning.  
      SIX SENIOR PARTNERS have gathered after hours.  Alex Grant 
      and Andrew are two.  The others (HAFT, GUNDERSON, FIGGIS,  
      and JENKS) will be introduced in good time.

      Andrew hands the leather folio to Alex, then takes a seat 
      alongside her at the table.  A POWERPOINT SCREEN sits ready 
      in the b.g.

                                  ALEX
                    Alright, let s get started.  We 
                    only have a few minutes before our 
                    client arrives.

      The partners quiet.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Thank you.  Well, I have good news.  
                    Today, we welcomed our twenty-first 
                    partner, Mitchell McDeere.  It went 
                    just as we planned... almost.

                                  FIGGIS
                    Almost?

                                  ALEX
                    We offered him an in-house 
                    position.  He preferred to create 
                    an Association.                                                                                  110.


                                  HAFT
                    That s not what we talked about.

                                  ALEX
                          (strong, curt)
                    It s all McDeere would accept.  
                    Bottom line, his office is now the 
                    Criminal Division of this firm and 
                    that is what we talked about.

      Her power backs them off.

                                  JENKS
                    Does he know why we made him an 
                    offer?

      Alex looks to Andrew.  She nods for him to answer.

                                  ANDREW
                    No.  He thinks we want a piece of a 
                    tort case he found.  A client named 
                    Althea Sanderson.
                          (then)
                    I took a look.  It s actually a
                    damn good case.  And thanks to Alex, 
                    we now own fifty percent.

                                  ALEX
                    Consider it a bonus.

                                  ANDREW
                    Of course, our real interest hasn t 
                    changed.

      Andrew grabs a POWERPOINT REMOTE.  He hits a BUTTON and a 
      PHOTO APPEARS on the screen.  To our shock, IT S A PHOTO OF 
      SARAH HUGHES, the young woman charged with murder who Mitch 
      arraigned earlier.

                                  ANDREW (CONT D)
                    Sarah Hughes.  She was officially 
                    charged with murder this week.

                                  ALEX
                    Of course, ideally, we would ve 
                    known about this sooner.  But by 
                    the time we learned of her arrest, 
                    the court had already assigned   
                    the case to McDeere.

                                  ANDREW
                      Obviously, our priority here is 
                    control.  And now, McDeere reports 
                    to us.                                                                                  111.


                                  FIGGIS
                    How far has he gotten?

                                  ANDREW
                    Not far.  But now that he s ours, 
                    we can install our own phones, our 
                    own copy machines, even our own 
                    computers at his office. 

      The partners nod in approval.

                                  HAFT
                    We shouldn t stop there.  He should 
                    be under surveillance.

                                  FIGGIS
                    I agree.  We should be listening 
                      everywhere.

                                  ANDREW
                    We already have a man in the field.

                                  ALEX
                    Good.  Because let s be perfectly 
                    clear.  If Mitch McDeere ever finds 
                    the truth in this case, everyone in 
                    this room is going to prison.

      A tense beat.  The CAMERA PANS across the faces of the 
      partners, each one ready to do whatever it takes to protect 
      their own. 

      Suddenly, there s a KNOCK at the door.  We HEAR THE DOOR OPEN 
      and then a MAN S VOICE:

                                  MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Sorry (sniff), got stuck in some 
                    traffic.

                                  ALEX
                    And here s our client now.  No 
                    problem, Daniel.  We were just 
                      discussing your case.

      And now, the CAMERA REVOLVES TO REVEAL THE MAN who has 
      entered.  It s DANIEL MOXON, the man we met in the TEASER -- 
      just before he jumped to his death.

      As the CAMERA REVEALS Moxon, a low RUMBLING SOUND begins in 
      the distance.  It s faint at first, like the sound of a fist 
      banging against a door.  Then another... and another until 
      the RUMBLING ESCALATES to a ROAR and we:

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:                                                                                  112.



      WHOOSH.  Suddenly, we are BACK WITH MITCH on the balcony of 
      Room 1801.  He s right where we left him, staring down at the 
      body of Daniel Moxon, eighteen stories below.

      A TITLE CARD READS:

                      DECEMBER, 2011...  THREE MONTHS LATER...

      The RUMBLING CONTINUES and now we realize it s the SOUND OF 
      FISTS banging on the door.  We HEAR THE VOICE we heard in the 
      TEASER:

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mitchell McDeere.  Daniel Moxon.  
                    Open the door!

      Mitch scans the room for a weapon.  Nothing.  Panic begins to 
      rise in his chest.  He returns to the balcony, looking for an 
      escape route, but there s nowhere to go.  Unless... there s a 
      BALCONY outside the next room.  Could he jump it!?  Is it too 
      far to reach!?

      Mitch has no choice.  He rips off his suit jacket and gets 
      ready to go.  But just at that moment, the DOOR CRASHES IN, 
      SPLINTERING OFF ITS HINGES!

      Mitch is jolted -- it s too late.  OFF his eyes, as they 
      widen with fear, we:

                                                  SMASH TO BLACK...
