      Beckett heads out of the room. Castle watches her go, a

    At the piano is the SILVER HAIREDFOX ticklingthe ivories 
    and drinking a Martini.As Castle crossesthe living room, 
      Martha notices him.

                                  MARTHA (CONT D)
                  Hey dollface.Just showing Burthere 
                  how we did it at the Palace.

                                  CASTLE
                  Does he know it s your theme song?  

    She makes a face at him, and then...

                                  MARTHA
                  Five. Six. Seven. Eight...  I always 
                  say "come on, le'sgo" Jistwhen I 
                  ortasay nix!

      Castle heads down the hallway.


      Martha can be heard faintlyin the background as Castle 
      enters and crossesto the fridge.As he grabsa can of 
      WHIPPEDCREAM, he notices Alexis at the kitchen table doing 
      homework.

                                  CASTLE
                  You remissing the late show.

                                  ALEXIS
                  I saw it in previews.

    He shakesthe whippedcream can and spraysa moundof it into 
      directly into his mouth.       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     19.


                                  CASTLE
                  Looks like we vegot a new lead. 

                                  ALEXIS

                  Sorry, Switchblade.I still belong to 
                  you.

                                  ALEXIS
                  So you wannatell me, or do I have to 
                  read it on the fan sites?

                  pornyou want. Just stay away from the 
                  fan sites. 

                                  ALEXIS
                  Seriously, Dad. Are you in some kind 
                  of trouble?

                                  CASTLE
                  Despite my best efforts, no. They want 
                  my help on a case... 

    He holds the whippedcream above her mouth, offering.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Baby bird?

                                  ALEXIS
                  Already brushed.

                                  CASTLE
                  Your loss.

    He gives himself another squirt.

                                  ALEXIS
                  What s the case?      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     20.


                                  CASTLE
                  Apparently, someone s been killing 
                  people the way I do in my books. 

                                  ALEXIS
                  Oh god. That s horrible.

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah.

                                  ALEXIS
                  How many?

                                  CASTLE
                  Two so far.

                                  ALEXIS
                  Are you okay?

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah.It s just so senseless.

                                  ALEXIS
                  Murder usually is.

                                  CASTLE
                  No. Murder usually makes a great deal 
                  of sense. Passion, greed, politics. 
                  What s senseless here are the stories 
                  the killerchose.

    And we see Castle is bothered.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Flower For your Grave? Hell HathNo 
                  Fury?My truly lesser works. Why would 
                    a psychoticfan pick those?

                                  ALEXIS
                  Maybe because he s psychotic.

      Castle isn t sure. Alexis takes the can of whippedcream from 
    her father.

                                  ALEXIS (CONT D)
                    Now, come on. It s bed time.


      Castle tucksAlexis into bed.

                                  CASTLE
                  You call your momback?      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     21.


                                  ALEXIS
                  She s coming into town next month. She 
                  wants to take me shopping. That okay?

                                  CASTLE
                  What? And miss that awesomelyawkward 
                  experience of being the creepymiddle- 
                  age man loiteringoutside the dressing 
                  room of JuicyJeans?MethinksI lllive.

      Castle gives her a kiss on the foreheadand heads toward the 
      door.

                                  ALEXIS
                  You think it was a mistake, don t you?

                                  CASTLE
                  What?

                                  ALEXIS
                  Killing off Derrick.

      Castle stands in the dark. He doesn t respond.

                                  ALEXIS (CONT D)
                  That s why you can t write, isn t it? 
                  You think you renever going to find 
                  another character that good again. 

      Again, Castle doesn t reply, but we see she s struck a chord.

                                  ALEXIS (CONT D)
                  You will, Dad. I know you will. You 
                  just need something to inspireyou.

                                  CASTLE
                  Goodnight.


      Heading to his bedroom, Castle passes by a doorway. He stops. 
      Staresin. An empty chair is visible in the glow of a 
      monitor.

      A window is open on the computer screen. A document, blank 
      except for  CHAPTER ONE.  Castle takes a step, but can t 
      bring himself to enter the room. Disappointed, he turns and 
      heads back down the hall.


      Posters of bookcoversline the walls. And of course, the 
      company s logo, THE BLACK PAWN, is everywhere. 

      INTERNShumpbags of mail over to Gina and Beckett.

                                  GINA
                  He gets about a thousand letters a 
                  week. 

                                  BECKETT
                  How does he keep up with it all?

                                  GINA
                  Nick?He only wants the ones with 
                  naked pictures. We send a form letter 
                  to the rest.

                                  BECKETT
                  In the last few weeks, anything odd 
                  turn up?

                                  FEMALE INTERN
                  It s all odd.

                                  BECKETT
                  How about death threats?

                                  GINA
                  You vemet the man. He positively 
                  inspiresdeath threats.


       CHAPTER ONE  just staresat us. As he leansforward, 
      Castle s reflectionappears in the screen. 

      He s in a bathrobesippinghis coffee. His fingershover
      above the keyboard, but then he clickshis writing window 
      closed and opens a GOOGLEsearch. 

      Types in  AlisonTisdale . He starts making notes.


      Beckett comes in with UNIFORMScarrying the bags of mail. 

                                  BECKETT
                  Set these up in interrogation three. 
                  We hear from the lab?

      Esposito looks up from his desk.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     23.


                                  ESPOSITO

                  Fisk.Guy was careful.

                                  BECKETT
                  Any connection between Fiskand 
                  Tisdale?

                                  ESPOSITO
                  Other than your boy there, no.

      Esposito nodsacross the bullpen. Beckett sees Castle across 
    the way, talking with CAPTAIN ROYMONTGOMERY -- African-
      American, mid-fifties -- Beckett s gruffbut paternalboss.

                                  BECKETT
                  What s he doing here?

                                  ESPOSITO
                  Maybe he likes you.

                  Mr.Castle has offered to assist with 
                  the investigation. 

                                  CASTLE
                  It s the least I can do for the city I 
                  love.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  Given the circumstances, I think it s 
                  a good idea.

                                  BECKETT
                  Sir, can I speak to you a moment? 
                  Privately.


      Beckett and Montgomery. 

                                  BECKETT
                  No. Uh-uh.Absolutely not.       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     24.

                  babysitsome dime-store novelist who

                  I mnot asking you to babysit,

                  a-bitchbefore we reknee deep in

                  He knows his fans better than anyone. 
                  If there s a needlein that haystack, 
                  he may be the only guy who can 
                  recognize it. Do I make myself clear?

                                  BECKETT
                  Yes, sir.


      Beckett comes out and sees a smiling Castle.

                                  BECKETT
                  What s so funny?

                                  CASTLE
                  You got your asschewed.

                                  BECKETT
                  Hardly.

                                  CASTLE
                  I read lips.

      Beckett heads to interrogation. Castle follows -


      - trying to keep up.

                                  CASTLE
                  Look, why don t we just start over.

                                  BECKETT
                  What s the point?       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     25.


                                  CASTLE
                  I think we got off on the wrong foot. 
                  I came off as a...

                                  BECKETT
                  A callous self-centered jackhole?

                                  CASTLE
                  Something like that.

                                  BECKETT
                  Well, aren t you?
                            (offCastle s look)
                  Yeah.So why start over?

      Beckett pushesthrough a door into... 


      UNIFORMSare dumping the contents of the bags onto a large 
      table. Beckett grabssome evidence glovesand pullsthem on.

                                  BECKETT
                  Okay, people. I want two piles--
                  Ordinary fan mail here, and anything 
                    remotelythreatening here.

                                  UNIFORM
                  No, ma am.

                                  BECKETT

                          (beat)
                    Alrightpeople. Let s go.

    The UNIFORMSbegin tearingin. Castle pullson his own pair 
    of evidence glovesand takes a seat by Beckett.


    We pan over stacks of letters. Envelopes litterthe floor.  
      Dead coffee cupsscattered across the table.       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     26.


    But everyone is still at it.  Beckett looks up and catches 
      Castle looking at her.

                                  BECKETT
                  What?

                                  CASTLE
                  Nothing. It s just, the way your brow
                  furrowswhen you rethinking. It s 
                  cute.
                          (beat)
                  I mean not if you replaying poker.
                  Then it dbe deadly, but otherwise -

                                  BECKETT
                  Can I ask you a question? 

                                  CASTLE
                  Shoot.

                                  BECKETT
                  Why are you here? You don t care about 
                  the victims, so you aren t here for 
                  justice. You don t care it s your 
                  books, so you aren t here for outrage. 
                  So what? Are you here just to annoy
                  me?

      A beat as he considers her question.

                                  CASTLE
                  I mhere for the story. 

                                  BECKETT
                  The story?

                                  CASTLE
                  Why thosepeople? Why thosemurders? 
                  Why my books?

                                  BECKETT
                  Sometimes there is no story. Sometimes 
                  the guy s just a psychopath.

                                  CASTLE
                  There s always a story, always a chain 
                  of events that makes everything make 
                  sense. Take you for example... Under 
                  normal circumstances, you shouldn t be 
                  here. Smart, good looking women become 
                  lawyers, not cops.And yet here you 
                  are. Why?      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     27.


                                  BECKETT
                  You rethe novelist. You tell me.

                                  CASTLE
                  You renot bridge and tunnel, no trace 
                  of the burroughswhen you talk. That 
                  means Manhattanand that means money. 
                  Odds are you went to college, probably 
                  a good one. You had options, lots of 
                  options, better options, more socially 
                  acceptable options. And yet you chose 
                  this. That tells me something must 
                  have happened. Not to you - you re
                  wounded but not that wounded. It was 
                  someone you cared about. Someone you 
                  loved. And you could veprobably lived 
                  with that, except the person 
                  responsible was never caught. And 
                  that, DetectiveBeckett, is why you re
                  here.

    He can see by the look on his face that he s right.

                                  BECKETT
                  Cutetrick. But don t think that means 
                  you know me.

                                  CASTLE
                  Point is, Detective, there s always a 
                  story. You just have to find it. 

      Beckett looks down at the letter in her hand. Scrawledon it 
    are very disturbing childishpictures of murders, including 
    the rose petalmurder, the pentagrammurder.

                                  BECKETT
                  I think I just did.

                                      ACT THREE




      Controlled chaos. Ringingphones.HOMICIDE DETECTIVES working 
      cases. Beckett s at her file-covered desk on the phone. 

      Castle s with Esposito by the board, re-examining the photos 
    of AlisonTisdaleand Martin Fisk.

                                  ESPOSITO
                  You know in  Dead Man s Chest,  when 
                  those fishermenfind that body stuffed
                  in a crabpot?

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah.

                                  ESPOSITO
                  How do you come up with that stuff?

                                  CASTLE
                    Congenitaldefect. My mother drank a 
                  lot of gin when she was pregnant. 
                          (looksback at Beckett)
                  How about her? What s her deal?

                  guess that s what happens when your 
                  mother s murdered. You end up working 
                  the job the way alcoholicswork the 
                  bottle. 

      Beckett hangsup the phone.

                                  BECKETT
                  Looks like we got lucky. They got a 
                  print off the letter.

                                  CASTLE
                  Whose?

                                  BECKETT
                  This isn t one of your books, Castle. 
                  Our system s backlogged.It lltake at 
                  least a week to run a match.

                                  ESPOSITO
                  Assuming there s one in the system.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     29.


                                  CASTLE
                  A week?

                                  BECKETT
                  Welcome to reality, Superstar.

                                  CASTLE
                  I never liked reality much.

      Castle pullsout his CELL PHONE and dials.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Denise?It s NickCastle. He in?
                          (toBeckett)
                  Like I said, the Mayor s a fan.
                          (intophone)
                  Yo, big cheese... It s Nickie.Good, 
                  good. Yeah.Of course...

    He walks away as he continues the conversation.

                                  ESPOSITO
                  Man s got the Mayor on speed dial. The 
                  rich really are different.

                                  BECKETT
                  You want him? He s yours.

                                  ESPOSITO
                  Oh no. A control freaklike you with 
                  something you can t control? That s 
                  more fun than SharkWeek.

      Castle hangsup the phone and crossesback.

                                  CASTLE
                  You llhave it an hour.

                                  BECKETT
                  Mr.Castle. We don t do that here.

                                  CASTLE
                  Do what?

                                  BECKETT
                  Half the guyshere are waiting for 
                  prints. We don t jump the line.

                                  CASTLE
                  I think someone feels threatened.

                                  BECKETT
                          (exasperated)
                  I mnot threatened.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     30.


                                  CASTLE
                  No. I get it. I can call the mayor, 
                  you can t.

                                  BECKETT
                  We have procedure. Protocol.

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah, and you always come to a 
                  complete stop and never fudgeyour 
                  taxes. Tell me, Beckett, you ever have 
                  any fun? Y know, cut loose. Let down 
                  the hair. Drop the top.

      McNultynearby hangsup the phone. 

                                  MCNULTY
                  They just found another one. 


      Beckett unholstersher gun and turns to Castle, vaguely
      threatening.

                                  BECKETT
                  Stay here.

                                  CASTLE
                  Scout shonor.

    And Beckett is out of the car, moving with the cops.


      Copswith weapons drawn flank a door. Beckett knocks.

                                  BECKETT
                    KyleFogerty!NYPD!Open up!

    No answer. Beckett steps aside and two officers slama ram 
      into the door. It burstsopen. Beckett s the first through, 
      weapon at the ready.       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     34.


      Moving through the apartment, the copsbreak off into 
      different rooms, yelling  Clear  as they clear the rooms. We 
      follow Beckett up the front hall and into the living room. No 
      one s there. Beckett turns to see a BOOKCASE.

      It s filled with NickCastle books, and only NickCastle 
      books. Most are dog-earredfrom mutiplereads. She pullson 
      glovesand takes one off the shelf.The pages are highlighted
    and notes are written in the margin.

                                  COP
                  Detective.You gottasee this.


    The copopens a closet.Inside is a psychomuralcollageof 
      NickCastle photos and crude childishdrawings just like the 
      letter Beckett found. It s a veritibleshrine.

                                  CASTLE
                  Well that s creepy.

      Beckett turns around to see Castle right behind her.

                                  BECKETT
                  You promised you dstay.

                                  CASTLE
                  What? I was never a scout.

                                  COP#2
                  Detective.

      Another coppullsa garbage bag out from under the bed. 
      Sticks his glovedhand in and pullsout bloody clothing. We 
      recognize it from the Tisdalemurder.Beckett checks the 
      blouse, two bullet holes in it.

    And then the coppullsout a gun. Beckett looks grim.


      A GEEKYLOOKING KID, obliviousto the world around him, mops
    the floor intensely while murmuringto himself. There s 
      something a little off about him.

      With Castle, Beckett and Montgomery. 

                                  BECKETT
                  State medical records say he s got 
                  pervasive developmentaldisorder.

                  That explains his fixation.PDD
                  sometimes manifestsin an obsession

                                  ESPOSITO
                  Part of the volunteer work for her 
                  degree. She placed him in his job at 
                  the diner.Turns out Kyledidn t look 
                  too far for his victims. According to 
                  the owner, Martin Fiskand Kendra
                  Phillipswere both customers.

      They move out...


                                  MONTGOMERY
                  OK, let s get him a P.D.and send it 
                  up to the D.A.

                                  CASTLE
                  What? That s it? 

                                  ESPOSITO
                  We got the guy, Chief. What more do 
                  you want?

                                  CASTLE
                  The kidcan barely mopa floor. How 
                  can you think it s him?

                                  ESPOSITO
                  Oh, I don t know. He had the murder 
                  weapon and the victim s belongingsat 
                  his house? C mon.This one s airtight.

                                  CASTLE
                  That s the problem. It s too easy. The 
                  reader would never buy it.

                                  BECKETT
                  This isn t one of your books, Castle. 
                  We think what the evidence tells us to 
                  think. Out here, we find a guy 
                  standing over a body with a gun, he s 
                  the guy who did it.

      They continue up the hall, leaving Castle a little stunned.


      A pokergame is in session. Cigarsmoke in the air. We 
      recognize some of the players - STEPHEN KING, JAMES
      PATTERSON, SUE GRAFTON, and of course, NICKCASTLE. King 
      throwsin some chips.

                  A little self-aggrandizing, don t you 
                  think?

                  The copsare able to track him down, 
                  and in the apartment is all the 
                  evidence they need for a conviction.

                                  SUE GRAFTON
                  OK.Then what happens?

                                  CASTLE
                  That s it. 

                                  STEPHEN KING
                  That s it?

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah.They arrest him.

      A beat. The other writers look at each other. And then laugh.

                                    JAMESPATTERSON
                  Jesus, that s terrible. No wonder 
                    you reblocked. 

                                  SUE GRAFTON
                  Guy doesn t leave prints at the scene, 
                  but sendsa letter with prints? Right 
                  there, you lost me. 

                                  STEPHEN KING
                  Yeah, I mean where s the twist?

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah, there s gottabe a twist. Like 
                  maybe this kidwas set-up.

                                  STEPHEN KING
                  That s what your story needs - the 
                  character that thinks the kid s
                  innocent and keeps digginguntil he 
                  finds the truth.

      A funny look crossesCastle s face. He smiles.

                                  CASTLE
                  I know just the guy.

      Castle layshis cards down on the table. The others groanas 
    he takes the pot.

                                        ACT FOUR




      Beckett enters to find Castle sitting at her desk, reading 
      through her papers. 

                                  BECKETT
                  What are you doing?

      Beckett snatchesthe papers from his hand and slipsthem back 
      into their file.

                                  CASTLE
                  Novelist s habit. Peekingthrough 
                  medicine cabinets, reading other 
                  people s mail. 

                                  BECKETT
                  My files are confidential. 

                                  CASTLE
                  Worse than that. They reboring.

                                  BECKETT
                  Why are you here?

                                  CASTLE
                  I just came down here to give you 
                  this. A little something to 
                    memorializeour brief partnership.

      From his bag, he hands her a gift-wrappedbox.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Don t look so suspicious. Go on. Open 
                  it.

    She does. It s a copy of Storm s End. He opens it up to the 
      first page.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Look. I even signed it for you. Not 
                  that I think you rea fan. 

                                  BECKETT
                  Thank you. That s actually kind of 
                  sweet.

    He catches her with his eye and turns on the sexy.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     40.


                                  CASTLE
                  Well...

                                  BECKETT
                  Well.

                                  CASTLE
                  Nice to have met you, Detective
                  Beckett.

    He leansin and gives her a kiss on the cheek, and walks 
      away. 

    As she watches him go her face betraya little emotion. She s 
      a little bit smitten.She sinksdown in her chair, takes a 
      moment and then turns back to her desk. She shufflesher 
      files a beat and then...

      Wait. Something s missing. She sorts through her papers a 
      little panicked.

                                  BECKETT
                  He didn t.

    She looks through them again and her eyes narrow.

                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                  He did!

    She springs up.

                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                    CASTLE!


      Castle hearsBeckett calling. He burstsout the door...


      Castle looks back at her on the steps of the precinct and 
      smiles a little grin. He reaches into his bag, pullsout the 
      case files and starts to read.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     41.



      Castle sits in the corner of the long READING HALL with the 
      case files spread out in front of him. He picksthrough the 
      arrest reports, jotssome notes, and examines crime scene 
      photographs with a magnifyingglass.

      JEANHILLPEPPER, a LIBRARIANin her late 50s, places a stack 
    of books on the table next to him. 

                                  CASTLE
                  Thanks, Jean.

    The two of them go back a long way.

                                  HILLPEPPER
                  Just glad to see you back. I was 
                  worried you dstopped writing.

                                  CASTLE
                  Never.

    At the far end of the READING HALL, Beckett enters with two 
      uniforms.She crossesto Castle.

                                  BECKETT
                  You rea conniving, scheming, 
                  despicableliar.

                                  CASTLE
                  You say that like it s my fault.

                                  BECKETT
                  Of course it s your fault. 

                                  CASTLE
                  Would you have showed me the files if 
                  I dasked?

                                  BECKETT
                  No.

                                  CASTLE
                  So you admit you left me no choice.

      Beckett shakesher head, exasperated.

                                  BECKETT
                  Cuffhim...       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     42.


      Castle seems non-plussedas the uniformsbegin to cuffhim.

                                  CASTLE
                    Mmm.Bondage.What s my safe word?

                                  BECKETT
                  NicholasCastle, you reunder arrest 
                  on charges of felonytheft and 
                  obstructionof justice.

                                  CASTLE
                  You forgot  Making you look bad. 

                                  BECKETT
                  Y know, for a minute there you made me 
                  think you were human.

                                  CASTLE
                  How dyou find me anyway?

                                  BECKETT
                  I ma detective.It s what I do.

                                  CASTLE
                  My mother told you, didn t she?

                                  BECKETT
                          (to the cops)
                  No need to be gentle.

      Beckett begins packing upsthe files, starting with the photo
    of a flower covered AlisonTisdale.

                                  CASTLE
                  By the way, the rose petalsin the 
                    Tisdalemurder?  They regrandiflora, 
                  not hybridteas.

                                  BECKETT
                  I llmake a note of it. 

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah, you probably should. Because it 
                  means that KyleFogertyis innocent.


      Beckett drives. Castle s in the back seat in cuffs.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     43.


                                  CASTLE
                  The kind of rose petalmight not be 
                  important to you or to the murderer, 
                  but to a PDDwith an obsessive 
                  fixationit would vebeen impossible 
                  notto get the details right. 

                                  BECKETT
                  So he was sloppy.

                                  CASTLE
                  An obsessive s incapable of being 
                  sloppyabout their obsession. The 
                  release comes from getting the details 
                  absolutely right.

      Castle leansforward.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  If you ask me, these killing are the 
                  work of a second rate mind.

                                  BECKETT
                  No one asked you.

                                  CASTLE
                  The M.E.report says Fiskwas 
                  strangledwith a neck-tie, not 
                  suffocatedby a plastic bag like in 
                  the story. And we both know Kendra s
                  dress was green, not blue like it was 
                  in the story.

                                  BECKETT
                  And the evidence all over his 
                  apartment? His knowledge of all three 
                  victims? I suppose you have a theory 
                  about that. 

                                  CASTLE
                  I said he didn t do it. I didn t say 
                  he wasn t framed.

                                  BECKETT
                  And I suppose Elvisis still alive, 
                  and the CIAkilled JFK.

                                  CASTLE
                  Actually, Elviskilled JFK.


      Castle sits on his cotsinging, much to the chagrinof the 
      others in lockup.

                                  CASTLE
                  Swing low-ow-ow-ow-owsweet chari-uht.

                                  GUARD
                  Castle! NickCastle! You made bail.


      Alexis and Martha wait with Beckett and Captain Montgomery.

                                  ALEXIS
                  Hellofather.

                                  CASTLE
                    Hellodaughter.

                                  MARTHA
                  Well, I wish I could say I was 
                  surprised. It s my fault really. He 
                  never had a father figure.

                                  CASTLE
                  That s not true, Mother. I had lotsof 
                  father figures. I see you vemet 
                    DetectiveBeckett and Captain 
                  Montgomery.

                                  ALEXIS
                  They veagreed to drop the charges, if 
                  you agree to behave.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  No more interference in this case, Mr.
                  Castle. Do we understand each other?

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah.We understand each other.
                  But tell me something, Captain. When 
                  did pursuing the truth become a bad 
                  thing?

      Castle shootsBeckett a disapprovinglook. She shrinksfrom 
    it a little.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     45.


                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Come on. Let s get out of here.


      Beckett s bothered. She takes a seat to find Castle s book 
      still on her desk. She opens it. Then puts it down. 
      Hesitates.And then picksup the case files.


      Castle dialshis cell phone.

                                  CASTLE
                  New York.The number for Jonathan
                  Tisdale.

                                  ALEXIS
                  What are you doing?

                                  CASTLE
                  If KyleFogertywas set up, then we 
                  aren t dealing with a serial killer.
                  We redealing with someone trying to 
                  get away with murder, someone who knew 
                  enough about KyleFogerty sfixation
                  with me to use it to cover his tracks.

                                  ALEXIS
                    You resupposed to drop the case.

                                  CASTLE
                  But it s just starting to make sense! 
                  The killerhad to have known bothhis 
                  intended victim andKyleFogerty.But 
                  the only victim that had any real 
                  knowledge of Fogerty scondition was 
                  AlisonTisdale.I think that s how he 
                  found out about Fogerty.I think 
                  Alisontold him.
                          (intophone)
                  No. In Manhattan.

      There s a gleein Castle s voice. He s enjoyinghimself.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  I think Alisonwas the killer starget 
                  all along.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     46.


                                  ALEXIS
                  What about the other victims?

                                  CASTLE
                  Red herringsto throw off the cops.
                  Even if our guy pinsAlison smurder 
                  on Fogerty, the copsare gonnawant 
                  motive. It s not open and shut. So 
                  instead of offingjust Alison, he 
                  targets people that can be linked back 
                  to his patsy.No one looks for motive, 
                  because mentally unstableserial 
                  killers don t have motive. 
                          (intophone)
                  Yes? Thanks...

    He jotsdown a number.

                                  ALEXIS
                  Gram.

                                  MARTHA
                  It s no use, kid.Might as well enjoy 
                  the ride.

      Castle hangsup the phone and dialsthe number.

                                  CASTLE
                  But our guy had motive. He wanted 
                    AlisonTisdaledead. I just need to 
                  find out why.

                                  ALEXIS
                  Dad, if I have to keep bailingyou 
                  out, I mgonnato seriously need you 
                  to raise my allowance.

                                  CASTLE

                    JonathanTisdale, please.

                                  ALEXIS
                  You need to raise it by a lot.

      PULL OUT ON: A photoof NICKCASTLE on a lobby bookstore 
      display filled with copies of STORM S END. CASTLE himself 
      walks by, hiding behind his  famous person  sunglasses.His

      Gina s on the phone overlookingthe canyonsof Manhattan.

                  Why aren t you writing?

      INTERCUT: Castle crossing the building s ATRIUM.

                                  GINA
                  Because you answered the phone. Now 
                  when am I going to see some pages?

                                  CASTLE
                  What... crsshhh.... sorry... 
                  crssshhh... you rebreaking up.

                                  GINA
                  Really, Nick?Fakereception loss?

                                  CASTLE
                  You reright. I msorry. That was 
                  childish.

    And with that, Castle just hangsup the phone. He arrives at 
    the RECEPTION desk where a pretty YOUNG WOMAN waits.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Hi. NickCastle. I have an appointment 
                  with Mr.Tisdale.

    The receptionistchecks her list. Finds Castle s name.

                                  RECEPTION
                  Go on up, sir. He s expecting you.

                                  BECKETT (O.S.)
                  Is he now?      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     48.


      Castle turns to see Beckett walking toward him.

                                  CASTLE
                  This isn t what it looks like. 
                          (offher look)
                  Okay. It s exactly what it looks like. 
                  But I can explain.

      Beckett sighs. She heads toward an open elevator and gets in.

                                  BECKETT
                  Well, are you coming?

      Castle looks around, confused, and then follows her into the 
      elevator. The doors close behind them.


      Beat. Castle looks at Beckett who stares straight ahead.

                                  CASTLE
                  Aren t you going to arrest me?

                                  BECKETT
                  I haven t decided yet.

                                  CASTLE
                  Great. What are you doing here anyway? 
                  I thought the case was closed.

                                  BECKETT
                  It is.

    The doors open, Beckett steps out into...


                                  CASTLE
                  Oh I get it.
                          (cracksa grin)
                  You think I mright, don t you?

                                  BECKETT
                  You know the difference between 
                  playing a copand being a cop, Nick?
                  It s important to you to be right. 
                  Whereas we can t afford to be wrong.

    She lets that hang a beat, then...

                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                  So while you spent the morning, doing 
                  what? Playing Guitar Hero and drinking 
                  Bloody Marys?      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     49.


    He half nods, she s not so far off. 

                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                  Yeah, I was re-interviewingwitnesses, 
                  victim s friends, families, co-
                  workers.Y know, copstuff.

    She rings the doorbell.

                                  CASTLE
                  What dyou learn?

                                  BECKETT
                  Nothing to make me change my mind.

                                  CASTLE
                  Yet.

      JONATHANTISDALE answers the door. He s a gauntman in his 
      late sixties. The last few days haven t been kind to him.


      Wood paneling, somber, with a God s eye view of the world. 
      Tisdale, with sad and sunken eyes, holds a picture of Alison.

                                    JONATHANTISDALE
                  It s against the natural order for a 
                  man to outlivehis own child.

                                  BECKETT
                  Did Alisonever mention having enemies 
                  or being threatened?

        Tisdaleshakeshis head.

                                    JONATHANTISDALE
                  People loved her. All she wanted was 
                  to make the world a better place and 
                  this is how she s repaid.
                          (beat)
                  I told all this to the other 
                  detective.

                                  BECKETT
                  We rejust following up.

                                  CASTLE
                  Do you know of anybody who would ve
                  profitedfrom Alison sdeath?

                                    JONATHANTISDALE
                    Profited?Mr.Castle, I mrich. My 
                  daughter was not. She abhoredmoney.

                  What little she had went to charity.
                          (toBeckett)
                  What s this all about? I thought the 
                  killerwas in custody?

                                  BECKETT
                  He is, Mr.Tisdale.Thank you for your 
                  time. We resorry to have bothered 
                  you.

      Beckett rises to go, but Castle holds his ground.

                                  CASTLE
                  Mr.Tisdale, Fortune Magazine 
                  estimates your net worth at nearly a 
                  quarter of a billion dollars. Is that 
                  true?

                                    JONATHANTISDALE
                  I don t keep track day to day.

                                  CASTLE
                  But it s in the ballpark.

                                    JONATHANTISDALE
                  I vebeen lucky, yes.

                                  CASTLE
                  Out of curiosity, what happens to all 
                  that money if something happened to 
                  you?

                                  BECKETT
                  Castle...

      Castleshootsher a look - Just go with this.

                                    JONATHANTISDALE
                  Half my estate goes to my charitable 
                  foundation. The rest goes to my 
                  children...
                          (painful pause)
                  I mean my son. Why?

                                  CASTLE
                  Just curious. Thank you for your time.

    But Beckett knows this means something to Castle.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Last time I saw her? About a month ago 
                  at Dad s.

                                  BECKETT
                  Were you two close?

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Not really. Honestly, we didn t have 
                  much in common, aside from our last 
                  name. She always wanted to see the 
                  best in everyone...

                                  CASTLE
                  And you live in the real world.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  That s right. Like that guy who killed 
                  her. She did everything to help him. 
                  Even brought him here and begged me to 
                  give him a job.

                                  BECKETT
                  But you didn t.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  This is a business, not a charity. My 
                  employees mess up, I lose my bond. 
                          (hesoftens)
                  I don t know... Maybe if I had helped 
                  him, things would be different. Maybe 
                  she d still be alive. Or then again, 
                  maybe we d both be dead.

                                  BECKETT
                  How did your sister react when your 
                  Dad informed you he was dying?

      Beat. We see Harrison ssurprised they know but he covers.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  She was upset. We both were.

      Beckett and Castle share a look. Confirmation.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     54.


                                      HARRISONTISDALE(CONT D)
                  What does that have to do with her 
                  murder?

                                  BECKETT
                  We did a little digging.Your business 
                  is struggling. Your tens of millions 
                  in debt. With her out of the way, your 
                    inheritencestands to double.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Is this some kind of joke? You already 
                  caught the killer.

                                  BECKETT
                  Yeah, and the first thing his 
                  lawyers lldo is shift suspicion to 
                  someone else, someone with motive. And 
                  then they llput me on the stand and 
                  ask me why I didn t investigate. Then 
                  the jury s gonnahave doubts. You want 
                  justice for your sister, right?

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Of course.

                                  BECKETT
                  Then you won t mind telling us where 
                  you were the night of her murder.

                  I was travelingon business.

      Harrisonopens his desk drawer and pullsout a passport. He 
      hands it to Beckett.

                  Check the stamps and you llfind I was 
                  out of the country for all three

                                  BECKETT
                  And a total lie.

      Castle looks at her, surprised.

                                  CASTLE
                  What happened to  We think what the 
                  evidence tells us to think? 

                                  BECKETT
                  I get him knowing exactly when his 
                  sister was killed, but the other two 
                  victims? He didn t pause. He didn t 
                  ask what the dates were. He didn t 
                  even look at his calendar and he was 
                  still ready with an alibi.In my 
                  experience, innocent people don t 
                  prepare alibis.

                                  CASTLE
                  So what now?

                                  BECKETT
                  I llcall passport control and check 
                  their logs. See if those stamps were 
                  forged.

                                  CASTLE
                  That s not how he would vedone it.
                  It dbe too easy to get caught.

                                  BECKETT
                  You have a better theory?

                  Unless you find the passport.

                                  BECKETT
                  If it even exists. If we reeven 
                  right.

                                  CASTLE
                  Oh, come on. We were having fun. Don t 
                  go all skepticalon me now.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     56.


                                  BECKETT
                  Here s a fun fact. Judges don t grant 
                  search warrants based on conjecture.
                  We need evidence.

                                  CASTLE
                  That shouldn t be much of a problem 
                  for the youngest woman ever to make 
                  detective.

                                  BECKETT
                  You just better be right.


      Harrisoncloses his office door and crossesto a wall safe. 
    He spinsthe lock and opens it. Inside - CASH, a GUN, and 
      ANOTHER PASSPORT. He tucksthe gun into his waistbandand 
      pullsout the passport... A FRENCH PASSPORT. He staresat it 
      a beat then sticks it into his shredder.

                                        ACT SIX


      Castle enters with a couple of Starbucksand places a Grande
      latteon Beckett s desk. She s just wrappingup a phone call. 

                                  BECKETT
                    Oui.Oui.Merci.

    She hangsup and turns to Castle.

                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                  That was the Parishotel Tisdalestayed 
                  the night of his sister s murder. 
                  Housekeeping remembered him because his 
                  room went vacant for two days.

                                  CASTLE
                  Parisis only a five hour flight.

                                  BECKETT
                  I got the same story from the hotel in 
                  MexicoCity where he was during the 
                  Fiskmurder and the LondonHotel 
                  during the Phillipsmurder.

                                  CASTLE
                  I mimpressed. 

                                  BECKETT
                  You renot the one issuing the warrant.


      Harrison crosses to his desk and sits down at his computer. 
    He clicks open a file - photographs of KYLE FOGERTYand the 
      victims. He highlights them and clicks delete. As he s doing 
      that, he opens a locked drawer and pulls out a manila 
      envelope. Inside it is a thick file folder. Scrawled on it 
    tab in sharpie -  KYLE FOGERTY . Below that, on the line 
      marked CASEWORKER, it reads  Alison Tisdale. 


      CASTLE sits on a bench outside the Judges  chambers, waiting. 
      Across the way from him, sitting on a bench is a young boy 
    and his mother. The mother is buried in a magazine.

      Castle locks eyes with the boy. He makes a funny face. Beat. 
    The boy makes a funny face back. Castle makes an even funnier 
      face. The boy, not to be outdone, uses his hand to spread his 
      mouth wide, and sticks out his tongue. Castle, getting 
      competitive, pulls his lips up and his eyelids down. 

      BECKETT grabs CASTLE by the hand and yanks him off the bench.

                                  BECKETT
                  You re like a child.

                                  CASTLE
                  Did you get it?

      Beckett nods to the paper in her hand.


      Harrison is shredding the Fogertyfiles in his home shredder. 
    He tries to feed too many sheets in, and the shredder jams. 
    He switches his shredder between forward and reverse, trying 
    to get the papers to shred.


      Beckett, flankedby the uniforms, knockson the door.


      Harrisonlooks up from his shredding.

                                  BECKETT (O.S.)
                    Mr.Tisdale.NYPD.We have a search 
                  warrant.

      Panic on his face. He looks down. The file s only half-way 
      shredded, and stuck in the shredderis the picture of 
      Fogerty.Another KNOCK. Harrisongrabsthe papers, shredded
    and unshreddedand shovesthem into a garbage bag.


      Beckett knockson the door again. No response. Beckett looks 
      past the UNIFORMSto the building s DOORMAN.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     60.


                                  BECKETT
                  Open it!

    The DOORMANcomes forward with his keys.


        Harrisonhearskeys in the door. Clutchingthe trashbag, he 
      picksup his gun, and looks around. Nowhere to go!

    THE FRONT DOOR -

    The door opens. Beckett enters the apartment followed by the 
      cops.But there s no sign of Harrison.


      Beckett bendsdown and examines the remnantsof shredded
      documents on the floor. She puts her hand on the shredder.

                                  BECKETT
                  Still warm.

    He cell phone rings. She answers.

      A train screamsinto the station.

                                  BECKETT
                  It s over, Harrison.Let him go!

    And with that, Castle puncheshis elbowinto Harrison snose, 
    and snapshis gun away. Harrisonslumpsagainst the subway

      Beckett storms up to Castle.

                                  BECKETT
                  What the hell were you thinking? You 
                    could vegottenyourself killed.

                                  CASTLE
                  I don t think so.
                          (handsher the gun)
                  Safety was on the entire time.

                                  BECKETT
                  Why didn t you tell me?

                                  CASTLE
                  I wanted to hear him confess.

                                  BECKETT
                  Well, I guess this is it.

                                  CASTLE
                  It doesn t have to be. How about a 
                  dinner? We can debriefeach other.

                                  BECKETT
                  What? So I can be just another one of 
                  your conquests?

                                  CASTLE
                  Maybe I could be one of yours.

                                  BECKETT
                  It was nice meeting you, Nick.

                                  CASTLE
                  Too bad. It would vebeen great.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     64.


    She leansin and whispersin his ear.

                                  BECKETT
                  You have no idea how great.

      Smiling, she turns and walks away. Castle watches her go. 
      there sa look on his face... something... He smiles.


      3:00 a.m.Alexis wakesfrom a sound sleep. She hearsnoise 
      from the other room. She gets out of bed.


      Martha s up too, in her dressing gown. She puts her finger to 
    her lips... shhh... and she waves Alexis over. Peeringinto 
    her father s office, Alexis sees him in his writing chair 
      obliviousto everything but his fingerson the keyboard and 
    the words on the screen. Martha and Alexis share a smile. 


      Gina enters her office to find a box on her desk. She opens 
    the top to see the cover page of a manuscript.  Bullets and 
      Bracelets  by NicholasCastle.


      Beckett s at her desk, reading a case file. CAMERA swings
      around her shoulder to reveal inside the case file is a copy 
    of STORM S END. She s on the last chapter and diggingit.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  Beckett. My office. Now!

      Startled, she closes the file.


      Montgomery looks over Beckett.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  I just got a call from the Mayor. 
                  Apparently, you have a fan.

                                  BECKETT
                  A fan, sir?      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     65.


                                  MONGOMERY
                  NickCastle. Seems he s found the main 
                  character for his next set of novels. 
                  A tough but saavyfemale detective.

                                  BECKETT
                  I mflattered.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  Don t be. He says he needs to do 
                  research.

                                  BECKETT
                  Oh no.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  Oh yes.

                                  BECKETT
                  No way.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  Beckett...

                                  BECKETT
                  He s like a nine year-old on a sugar 
                  rush... totally incapable of taking 
                  anything seriously. 

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  He did help solve the case. And 
                  Beckett. When the Mayor s happy, I m
                  happy.

                                  BECKETT
                  How long, sir?

      Montgomery nodsover Beckett s shoulder to Castle, now 
      sitting at Beckett s desk. 

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  That s up to him.

      Castle grinsand waves. We push in Beckett s  son-of-a-bitch  
      look, but as she turns away we see a hintof a smile.
