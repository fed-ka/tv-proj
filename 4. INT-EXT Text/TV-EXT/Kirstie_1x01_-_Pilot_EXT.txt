      MADDIE STANDS OUTSIDE THE STAGE DOOR SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS FOR A 
      FEW FANS.  AS THEY DISPERSE SHE HEADS TO THE CURB. SHE LOOKS 
      UP AND DOWN THE BLOCK THEN TAKES OUT HER CELL AND DIALS.

      INTERCUT WITH:


      OWEN, DRESSED IN A VINTAGE STYLE GENERALS UNIFORM, ADDRESSES 
      HIS UNSEEN TROOPS.

                                  OWEN

                Now the whole reb army is over that 

                summit waiting for us!  Our only 

                chance is to flank them and attack 

                from the rear.  Any questions?!

      REVEAL: MADDIE, THELMA AND FRANK, DRESSED IN MILITARY 
      UNIFORMS, STANDING AMONG A GROUP OF OTHER RE-ENACTORS. 

                                  OWEN (CONT D)

                Then sunblock up!

      EVERYONE APPLIES SUNBLOCK.  OWEN BLOWS HIS WHISTLE.

                                  OWEN (CONT D)

                And charge!

      A BUGLER BLOWS HIS HORN AND OWEN AND OTHER RE-ENACTORS CHARGE 
      THE HILL LEAVING MADDIE, THELMA AND FRANK STANDING THERE.  A 
      BEAT, THEN:

                                  THELMA

                You done bonding yet?

                                  MADDIE

                It is getting hot.

                                  FRANK

                I ll get the car.

      AND AS THEY SKULK OFF, WE...

      FADE OUT

      THE END.
