      EXT. NEAR THE SOVIET BORDER - NIGHT

        Miles above the Earth, a black object rockets straight
        toward us.  As it passes, we realize it is an unmarked jet,
        built for speed, currently in pursuit of another glowing
        craft.  A SUPER reads:

                            60,000 Feet Over Peshawar, West Pakistan
                                              May 1, 1960

      INT. U-2B SPY PLANE - NIGHT

        Breathing oxygen because of the altitude, the pilot makes
          adjustments, keys his communications radio.  This pilot is
        FRANCIS GARY POWERS and tonight he is flying straight into
      the history books.

                                        POWERS
                          Majestic, this is Talon.  I keep
                        flyin' the way I'm flyin' and I'm
                        gonna be chasing this bogey right
                        over Soviet airspace.  Advise.

      INT. MAJESTIC HEADQUARTERS - CONTROL AREA - NIGHT

          A state-of-the-art military communications facility, circa
        1960.  Built below ground, replete with analog clocks, a
        huge mainframe computer, and world-wide telemetry tracking
        boards.

      The duty shift includes two RADIO CONTROLLERS who listen to
        Powers' STATIC-RIDDEN TRANSMISSION.  One of them keys a
        microphone in response.

                                        CONTROLLER
                        Roger, Talon.  We have MJ-One on
                        the way, but you do not have
                          authorization to break border.

        Another man, in military uniform, approaches the two
          controllers.  He is CAPTAIN FRANK BACH, currently MJ-3, a
        physically imposing secret-keeper in his forties, who is
        clearly in charge as he keys the microphone himself.

                                        BACH
                        Talon, this is MJ-Three.  How long
                        before you're compromised?

        They wait for an answer.  It comes crackling back:        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT2.

                                        POWERS (V.O.)
                        About a minute and a half. That's
                        if I can keep up.

        Bach hesitates only an instant, then re-keys the microphone.

                                        BACH
                        Talon, you have authorization to
                        proceed.

        This dramatic announcement causes everyone to fall silent a
        beat before resuming their respective jobs and generating a
        chorus of TECHNICAL SPEAK, including:

                                        CONTROLLER
                        Incirlik tracking, this is
                          Washington.  We need high-band
                          telemetry in Section A, Vector
                        seven...

      On a global map before them, a blinking light approaches the
        Soviet Union.  Bach stares up at the map, stone-faced.

      EXT. ABOVE THE SOVIET UNION - NIGHT

      As the U-2 blasts after the bogey, we get a better look at
      it.

      It is OVAL, seemingly STRUCTURAL, with ROTATING LIGHT
        sources.

                                        POWERS (V.0.)
                          Majestic, I know I got one of the
                        best planes we build, but whatever
                        this guy's got, I want one, too.

        Suddenly, the craft simply SHOOTS STRAIGHT UP!

      As it does, its structure seems to give way and it becomes
        nothing more than a FLASH OF LIGHT!

      INT. U-2B SPY PLANE - NIGHT

        Powers reacts, visibly shaken but, when he talks, he exudes
      the calm of sheer professionalism.

                                        POWERS
                        Base, we have got an impossible
                        vertical ascent, followed by broken
                        visual contact and a clear radar.

      INT. MAJESTIC HEADQUARTERS - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

        Bach barely looks up as an older, man enters.  This is
        MJ-l (NELSON ROCKEFELLER), dressed in civilian clothes.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT3.

        Looking like he just woke up, he is escorted by two younger
        operatives, dressed in off-the-rack dark suits, white
        shirts, dark ties.  They will become known as MEN-IN-BLACK,
      or MIB.  MJ-l/Rockefeller surveys the map carefully.

                                        MJ- 1/ROCKEFELLER
                        Where is he now?

                                        BACH
                        About a thousand miles in.  Over Sverdlovsk.

          MJ-l/Rockefeller seems shocked by the mention of this Soviet
        location.  Bach shrugs.

                                        BACH (CONT'D)
                        You weren't here.  I made the
                          decision.

                                        MJ- 1/ROCKEFELLER
                        I'll tell you what you made, Bach.
                        You made one serious career-ending
                        mistake ...

          MJ-l/Rockefeller picks up a red phone and dials a single
        digit.

                                          MJ-l/ROCKEFELLER (CONT'D)
                        We're calling Ike.

        Bach hangs up MJ-1's call with a finger to the cradle
        button.

                                        BACH
                        Don't bother.  We lost it.  We're
                        bringing our man home.

        Crackling over the radio, they hear:

                                        POWERS (V.O.)
                        OH, MY GOD!  Base, we got a real
                        problem up here!

      EXT. AIRSPACE OVER SOVIET UNION - NIGHT

      The "bogey" has been replaced by the MOTHER SHIP!

      It is ENORMOUS -- the size of ten football fields.

        Worse, it is DROPPING DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH of the U-2! As
      it does, it begins to PULSE WITH ENERGY.

      INT. U-2B SPY PLANE - NIGHT

      The cockpit is flooded with a BLINDING LIGHT. Powers pushes
      on the throttle and arcs his aircraft in a BONE-CRUNCHING
        EVASIVE MANEUVER for which his plane has not been designed.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT4.

        Over his headset, we hear a flurry of BACKGROUND AUDIO from
      the Majestic headquarters controllers.


      INT. MAJESTIC HEADQUARTERS - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

      The room is alive with energy but the men are helpless to do
        anything except listen.

                                        POWRS (V.O.)
                        I don't know what I just saw but it
                        was as big as a cruise ship ... Oh,
                        God ... This is incredible ...

          MJ-1/Rockefeller sinks to a chair, helplessly waiting for
      the other shoe to drop.

                                        POWERS (V.O.)
                        All my instruments, everything,
                        it's all gone crazy ...  I'm
                        breaking apart here.'

                                        BACH
                                  (into microphone)
                        Talon, man-down security code Two-
                        Alpha.  Repeat, security code Two-
                        Alpha.  Do you read?

                                        POWERS (V.O.)
                                  (garbled)
                        I gotta eject!

        Over Bach's line there is the sound of an EJECTION DEVICE,
        followed by a high-pitched sound of the aircraft in FREE-
        FALL, and then STATIC.  Finally, NOTHING.  Bach turns to MJ-
        One.

                                        BACH
                        You should probably make your call
                        now.

        And, off this moment in history, spun into a mix of fear and
        denial, we:

      MAIN TITLES- SURREAL IMAGES

        NOSTALGIC IMAGES have been re-assembled into TECHNOLOGICALLY
        ENHANCED IMAGES as perceived by an alien intelligence.  They
        transition us in time from the final moments of the
        Eisenhower Administration to the opening days of the Kennedy
        Administration.

      The video images merge with bits and pieces of AUDIO from
        spoken words, speeches and popular music.  Our final
        chilling image from this extremely odd slice of Americana
        coalesces as we PULL BACK through the cornea of a human eye,
        then out further to reveal --

      -- a human face, mouth open in a silent scream of terror.
        This man is ELLIOT GRANTHAM and we are watching a turning
        point in human history.

        A white laser beam drills into the eye.  Swirling around the
        cylindrical light are the very images we've seen, images
        extracted from the mind's eye of the human subject.

      We are being studied by someone, or some thing.

      We watch as words slowly assemble themselves on our TV

      EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

        A SERIES OF SHOTS establish the confident power center of
      the Free World.  A SUPER reads:

                                          Washington, D.C.
                                        October 3, 1961

        PICK UP a '57 Chevy convertible with California plates as it
        drives by the recognizable monuments and buildings.  It is
        stuffed with the worldly possessions of JOHN LOENGARD
      and KIMBERLY SAYERS.  Together, they are fresh out of
        UCLA, sweethearts, and part of the wave of idealism sweeping
        over America in the giddy opening days of Camelot.

        Over this, we hear the middle-aged voice of a man the world
        will come to know as LOENGARD.

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        My name is John Loengard.  This
                        program is being presented as
                        fiction to protect those people
                        fighting in the Resistance.  But I
                        will tell you the truth now if
                        you will listen.

      The Chevy approaches the White House.

      EXT. GRANT PARK - DAY

        Loengard and Sayers seem thrilled to be on a grand adventure
      as they climb the stairs.  Before them looms an imposing
        view of the Capitol Building.  The voice-over continues:

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        When Kimberly and I came to
                          Washington during the first summer
                        of the 'New Frontier' , I landed my
                        first real job as an assistant on
                        Capitol Hill.  I thought I knew
                          everything.  I found out I knew
                        nothing.

        Loengard recruits a passer-by to snap a photo of the two.

        FLASH!  The final picture shows two smiling young lovers.
      The voice-over concludes:

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)

      INT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - DAY

        A key fumbles in the door, then it swings open.  Standing
        outside are Loengard and Sayers, escorted inside by MR.
        CHESNEY, the landlord.  As they all enter the furnished
        apartment:

                                        CHESNEY
                        Not exactly the White House, but
                        it's got that Capitol view you
                        wanted, Mister Loengard.

        Sayers once-overs the place apprehensively, while Loengard
        goes right to the window and peeks out the ratty curtains,
        revealing an unimpressive glimpse of the Capitol dome in the
        distance.

                                        LOENGARD
                                    (self-deprecating)
                        Look at that, Kim.  I can wave to
                        you from my new office.

        Sayers joins Loengard at the window, glancing briefly at the
        view, but clearly more concerned with the view inside.

                                        SAYERS
                        If we take this, Mr. Chesney, do we
                        get new curtains?  These look like
                        they've been around since the
                        Coolidge Administration.

        Chesney looks skeptical.

                                        SAYERS (CONT'D)
                        After all, we are paying ten
                        dollars extra for the 'view.'

                                        CHESNEY
                        For you, Mrs. Loengard, I think we
                        can swing some curtains.

                                        SAYERS
                        Thank you.  But it's not 'Mrs.'  At
                        least, not yet.

        This elicits a roll of the eyes from Loengard.

                                        CHESNEY
                        Oh, I see.  I just assumed ...

                                        LOENGARD
                        If it's a problem, we can keep
                        looking.

      An awkward beat as Chesney considers this.  Then:        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT 8.

                                        CHESNEY
                          Justdon't let my wife know.
                                  (leaving)
                        You want the place, come on down
                        for the keys.

        When the door closes, Loengard flops on the sofa, slightly
          exasperated.  Sayers wanders into the bedroom.

                                        SAYERS
                        This place could be great --
                          especially after I get a job and we
                        can buy some new furniture.
                                  (calls from O.S.)
                        You know what?  I should've made
                        new wallpaper part of the deal.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Kim, forget the apartment.  We're
                        lucky to get this place.  You see
                        how that guy looked at us?

        Sayers returns to the living room.

                                        SAYERS
                        Oh, because somebody thinks we're
                        'living in sin,' we should just get
                        married?

                                    (half-serious)
                        It would buy me credibility at work
                        and it would please the hell out
                        of your parents.

                        Nothing short of a royal wedding
                        will please my mother.  Certainly
                        not some rush job at the county
                          courthouse.  Besides, I thought we
                        already made a decision about this.

                                        LOENGARD
                                  (joking)
                        You know, other women would not
                        want to pass up an opportunity like
                        this.

        Taking a seat on his lap, Sayers does her sexy best to
        smooth his ruffled feathers.

                        Well, I admit, the chance to smash
                        chiffon wedding cake into that big,
                        sexy mouth of yours is tempting.

                                        LOENGARD
                        So what are we waiting for?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT 9.

                        You can't be president until you're
                          thirty-five.  That gives us ten
                        whole years to get married, have
                        kids and, hopefully, find a place
                        with more closet space.

        Loengard smiles.  This woman makes his day.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You know what I love best about
                        you?

                                        LOENGARD
                        You're gonna make one helluva First

      He kisses her.  We get the feeling they are about to
        inaugurate their new apartment.


      EXT. THE CAPITOL - DAY

        Loengard bounds up the steps, carrying a tray of coffees and
        a bag of donuts.

      INT. CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE - DAY

      The place is too small and too crowded for the level of
        activity going on.  Loengard enters.  He approaches the
        harried secretary, off-loads a cup.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Hey, Renee.  That's coffee, cream,
                        no sugar ... You seen Simonson?

        Tied up on too many telephone lines at once, the secretary
      an only point across the room at Chief Aide MARK
        SIMONSON, mid-thirties and overworked, who is moving
        through the office briefing his boss, Democratic Congressman
        CHARLES PRATT, a five-termer with a perpetual farmer's tan.

                                        SIMONSON
                        This is the amendment to the
                        housing bill.  We are against the
                          amendment and for the bill.

        Pratt nods, barely listening, stops near the front desk,
        picks up a manila envelope.

                                        PRATT
                          Simonson, this was supposed to be
                          delivered an hour ago.  What the
                        hell is going on around here?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT 10.

                                        SIMONSON
                          Congressman, I have to think
                        getting this amendment defeated is
                        more important than constituent
                        tickets to the U-S Mint tour.

                                        PRATT
                        Think about this:Those
people
                        gave me money last campaign.  A lot
                        of money!

        Loengard makes his move, taking the package from Pratt.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I can take that now, sir.
                                (to Simsonson)
                        Sorry, Mark.  I should have
                          delivered this yesterday like you
                        asked.

                                        PRATT
                          Loengard, you make sure they know I
                          personally called in their favor.

      As Pratt leaves, Simonson turns to Loengard.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Thanks, Loengard.  I owe you one.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Just trying to help out.  Not that
                        I don't enjoy catering to Fresno's

                                        SIMONSON
                        Look, I know you're being wasted,
                          Loengard.  Welcome to Washington.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I could make things easier for you.

                                        SIMONSON
                        I'm not sure I'm ready to have
                        Pratt killed just yet.

                        C'mon.  Give me a shot.

                        Be patient, Loengard.

                                        LOENGARD
                          I thought you had kids.

                                        SIMONSON

                        Well, if you let me help you out,
                        you might get to see them once in a
                        while.

        Simonson looks at Loengard, studying him.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Sounds like you've been talking to
                        my wife.  She wants me to quit this
                        job, you know.

                        Follow me.

        Simonson leads Loengard to a desk area, indicates a stack of
        files.

        Loengard breaks into a huge grin.  Simonson checks his watch
        again.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Mark, you won't regret this.

                        Just don't forget that package.

        Sayers works in the courtyard area on a picnic table with
        several neighborhood pre-schoolers, AD-LIBBING instructions
        while carving Halloween pumpkins.

        Loengard pulls up in his Chevy and parks across the street.
      He watches a beat, smiles, then jogs up to Sayers.

                        Thanks.  Hey, nice Jack-O-Lanterns.

        Sayers nods, but his compliment only stirs the discontent
        brewing beneath her smile.  After a moment she admits:

                        Look, I understand not wanting to
                        use your dad's connections.  So let
                        me talk to somebody on the Hill.  I
                        see people all the time, maybe --

                        The whole point is, I want to do

                                  (sighs)
                        I know.  I'm whining.

        Loengard pulls her close, gives her a re-assuring hug.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You do it your way, Kim.  But just
                        know I'm here if you need me.

      She kisses him, appreciative of his support.  But their kiss
      is cut short when one of the kids accidentally knocks his
        pumpkin off the table.  Sayers attends to the situation.

        Loengard sees her mood, grabs up two pencils used for
        marking the Jack-O-Lanterns and stabs them into the pumpkin
        head as antennae.  He hides his own head inside his shirt
      and holds the pumpkin above it.

                        Take me to you leader.

      The kids giggle.  Even Sayers has to smile at his silliness.

        crucial air bases of the period.  A sign tells us we are in

      INT. PROJECT BLUE BOOK OFFICE - DAY

        Loengard sits at a table with a number of files spread
        before him, taking notes.  A LIEUTENANT in uniform sits at a
        nearby desk, alternately eyeing Loengard and readinq the
        newspaper.

                                        LOENGARD
                          Lieutenant, how many cases did you
                        say you had last year?

        Loengard duly notes this.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT14.

                        You're not planning on going
                        through all of them, are you?

                                        LOENGARD
                        Never leave a stone unturned.

        Loengard offers a pack of gum.  The Lieutenant takes a stick
      and jams it in his mouth.

                        They're broken down into
                          categories.  You got your lights in
                        the sky which are usually airplanes
                        or the planet Venus, you got your
                        photos which are usually fakes,
                        then you got your contactees which
                        are always whackos.

                                        LOENGARD
                          Contactees?

                        You know, the ones who see the
                        little green men and go for a
                        joyride in their spaceships.

                                        LOENGARD
                        People actually say that?

                                        LIEUTENANT
                        We hear 'em all.

      The Lieutenant abruptly jumps to his feet and salutes toward
      the door.

                        Major Friend, sir.

        Entering the room is MAJOR ROBERT J. FRIEND, a man of crisp
        military bearing and a no-nonsense approach.

      He returns the salute, walks directly to Loengard.

                                        MAJOR FRIEND
                        They're getting younger and
                        younger.  You must be Loengard.

                        'Blue Book' since 1958.

        Major Friend looks over the files before Loengard.

                        So why has Pratt sent one of his
                        eager beavers out to dig through
                        all our files?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT15.

                                  (awkward)
                        Well, I think he's just interested
                        in seeing the taxpayers get their
                        money's worth.

                                        MAJOR FRIEND
                        Really?  You know how many cases we
                        had last year?

                                        LOENGARD
                                  (checking notes)
                          Five-hundred fifty-seven.

        Major Friend seems suitably impressed, continues.

                        Divided between exactly three field
                          investigators.  Son, we're the
                        biggest bargain around.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I think he's more concerned with
                        whether we should be spending
                        anything to investigate, you know,
                        'flying saucers.'

                                        MAJOR FRIEND
                        You're not a believer, I take it?

                                        LOENGARD
                        Well, it does sound a little
                          improbable, you have to admit.

                                        MAJOR FRIEND
                        I'm a soldier.  The Air Force has
                        ordered me to investigate and
                        that's what I do.

                                        LOENGARD
                        But you haven't come up with any
                        proof, have you?

                                        MAJOR FRIEND
                        You could read through every file
                        we've got and you still wouldn't
                        find cold, hard proof.  Doesn't
                        mean we're wasting our time or the
                          taxpayer's money.

                        If I could, I'd like to see the
                        recent files in the D.C. vicinity.
                        My boss wants me to check out some
                        of these people myself.

                        Who knows, maybe when I see what
                        kind of bang-up job you're doing, I
                        can convince the Congressman to get
                        you more funding.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT16.

                                        MAJOR FRIEND
                                  (unimpressed)
                        I won't hold my breath.
                                (to Lieutenant)
                        Give him what he needs.  We've got
                        nothing to hide.

        After Friend briskly departs the office, Loengard shrugs at
      the Lieutenant.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I think he's starting to warm up to
                        me -

      EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

        Loengard's Chevy drives down the street and parks in front
      of a house.  It's a chilly day.  A SUPER reads:

                            Portsmouth, New Hampshire
                                 December 11, 1961

      INT. THE CHEVY - DAY

        "Blue Book" files, road maps, a yellow legal pad, a
          pre-packaged bakery fruit cake and a roll of aluminum foil
        fill out the front seat.  Loengard removes the packaging and
        wraps the cake in the foil.

      EXT. NEW HAMPSHIRE HOME - DAY

      As he exits his car, Loengard pulls his coat tight around
      him to protect against the chill, takes his briefcase and
      the cake, walks up to the door and knocks.  BETTY HILL, a
        social worker by profession, answers.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Mrs. Hill?  Hi.  I'm John Loengard.
                        We talked on the phone.  I just
                        came from Pease Air Force Base
                        and --

                                        BETTY
                        -- I wish you people would just
                        leave us alone.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Mrs. Hill, I don't work with the
                        Air Force.  I'm from Congressman
                        Charles Pratt's office.

                                        BETTY

                        Oh ...        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT17.

                                        LOENGARD
                        If you feel like talking, my
                          girlfriend baked this fruit cake
                        for us.

        Loengard hands the cake to Betty.  A black man appears
        behind her.  This is BARNEY HILL, her husband.  They are an
          inter-racial couple.

                                        BARNEY
                        Is there a problem here?

                                        LOENGARD
                        No sir.  I was just telling your
                        wife there's new information about
                        the sighting you reported.

                                        BARNEY
                        We're listening.

        Loengard flips through his notes on a yellow legal pad.

                                        LOENGARD
                        That night, they tracked something
                        on radar in the same area.
                          Apparently it wasn't one of ours.
                        Plus, I've talked to two other
                          witnesses who saw something.

        Betty and Barney trade glances.

                                        BARNEY
                        If that's all true, then why do you
                        need a cake to talk your way in
                        here?

                                        LOENGARD
                        Well, sir, that's good point.
                        Probably was a pretty dumb idea.
                        But I'll be honest with you.  I was
                        sent out to prove the Air Force
                          investigation is a waste of money.
                        But right now, let's just say I've
                        got an open mind.
                                  (beat)
                        And, the truth is, it's a damn good
                        cake.

      INT. HILL HOUSE - NIGHT

        A blazing fire burns in the living room.  Loengard sits in a
        chair across from Betty and Barney.  He's setting up a reel-
        to-reel tape recorder.  Slices of fruit cake and coffee mugs
      all around, and a Christmas tree in the background.

                                        BARNEY
                        I'm not sure this tape recorder is
                        a good idea.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT18.

                                        LOENGARD
                        My boss wanted to hear your story
                        for himself ...

                                        BETTY
                        Maybe he can use it to get us some
                        answers, Barney.

        Barney nods his approval.  Loengard starts the tape roiling.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Why don't you just start at the
                          beginning?

                                        BARNEY
                        Here's what we know.  We were
                          returning from a vacation in
                        Canada, down U-S Three through the
                        White Mountains to Portsmouth.  It
                        was after midnight, pretty close to
                        a full moon.  There weren't any
                        other cars and any place to stay
                        was already closed.

                                        BETTY
                        I saw it first.  It looked like a
                        light following the car but I
                        looked at it through the binoculars
                        and saw a double row of windows.
                        Real windows!

                                        BARNEY
                          I thought she was crazy, but she
                        made me stop the car anyway.  I
                        went out into a field with the
                          binoculars ...
                                  (aside to Betty)
                          I thought we weren't going to tell
                        this to anyone.

                                        BETTY

                        He seems like a nice young man.  I
                        think we can trust him.

        Betty squeezes his hand.  Barney takes a beat, then:

                                        BARNEY
                        When I looked through those windows
                        I saw ... I saw about half a
                        dozen ... living beings ... looking
                        back at me.

        Loengard doesn't quite know what to make of this.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You mean people?

                        What did you do then?

                                        BARNEY
                          I panicked.  I thought I was about
                        to be captured so I ran as fast as
                        I could back to the car.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Were you actually  .. 'captured?'

                                        BETTY
                        We don't know what happened.  Next
                        thing we know we're back in the

                        this.  I don't see how he can

                        I'm gonna follow this guy when he
                        leaves.  See where he's going.
                        I'll be on two-way.

                        He ought to do one of those

                        I don't know.  You'd have to
                        testify.  And people might say
                        things.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT20.

                        I'm a black man married to a white

                        saw and where I was, I'll tell my
                        story to the whole damn world.

      MIB #4 picks up a telephone, speaks urgently into it.

                                        MIB #4
                        I think you better tell the Captain
                        we've got a problem.

      EXT. DESERTED ROAD - OUTSIDE D.C. - NIGHT

        Driving through the dark countryside, Loengard finds himself
        gripping the steering wheel.  He looks outside the car
        window at the night sky.  Almost a full moon.

        Trying to break up the mood, Loengard turns on the radio.
        It's Del Shannon's tune, "RUNAWAY."  As Loengard drives,
        something catches his eye.  It's a LIGHT, visible from the
        rear-view window.  Loengard turns the radio OFF, tries to
        crane his neck around the see if the light is still there.
      Now it's gone.  He shakes his head as if to clear the
        confusion, tries to relax.

      He turns the radio back ON, but this time the song is barely
        audible, obscured by STATIC.  Suddenly --

        A BLACK FLYING MACHINE

        Crests the horizon in front of him.  It's very dangerous
        looking, and it's heading RIGHT AT HIM!

        LOENGARD

        Panics, slams on his brakes, swerving to the side of the
        road.  He tries to re-start the engine but it's flooded, or
        dead.

        Loengard throws the door to the Chevy open and runs from the
        car.  The object is on fast approach.  Loengard flees for
      the cover of the trees off the side of the road.

      EXT. FORESTED AREA - NIGHT

        Loengard runs wildly into the thick brush.  Frantic, he is
        being tracked by a SEARCHLIGHT from the craft above.
        Loengard bursts into a clearing.

      As the craft lowers to the ground in front of him, Loengard
      is blinded by the BRIGHT LIGHT.  As he stands in the
        clearing, the WIND WHIPS wildly past him and there is a
        DEAFENING ROAR from the object.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT21.

        LOENGARD'S POV - THE LIGHT

      As four ALL-BLACK CREATURES emerge from it.  As the shapes
        move closer, we discern their human form.

        LOENGARD

        Reacts in panic as several men, dressed in non-descript
        black suits, take chase after him.

        Loengard is tackled from behind.  He struggles, but one of
        these MIB forcefully backhands him, knocking him to the
        ground.  This effectively ends Loengard's struggle.

        While Loengard recovers, the MIB leader steps in front of
        him, offers a hand to pull him up.  We recognize this leader
      as Frank Bach, the man who gave Francis Gary Powers
      the permission to overfly Soviet airspace.

                                        BACH
                        Very impressive work, Mister
                          Loengard.  You have a real talent.

                                        LOENGARD
                        How do you know who I am?

        Bach ignores Loengard, turns to one of the MIB and orders:

                                        BACH
                        Get his tape.

      One of the MIB dashes off through the clearing, back towards
        Loengard's car.  Bach turns back to Loengard.

                                        BACH (CONT'D)
                        Let me set the record straight for
                        you.  Betty and Barney Hill saw a
                        private airplane that strayed off
                        course.  They will not testify
                        before Congress, for Pratt or
                        anyone else.  Is that clear?

                                        LOENGARD
                                  (freaking out)
                        Why not?  Who are you?

                                        BACH
                        I am nothing more than a figment of
                        your imagination.  Because this
                        incident never happened.  You drove
                        home uneventfully.  Tomorrow you
                        will file a report telling Pratt
                        that 'Blue Book' doesn't cost
                        enough to be worth his attention.

        Loengard nods, scared out of his wits.  The MIB returns with
        Loengard's reel of tape, showing it off to Bach.

                                        MIB #1
                        Got it, Captain!        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT22.

                                        MIB #2
                        You want me to put him to bed?

        Bach motions for MIB #2 to lean closer and whispers to him.
        Loengard is hysterically frightened as MIB #2 moves closer
      and BOLTS HIS GUN outside his ear.

                                        LOENGARD
                        What?!  What are you doing?! I
                        HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING!!

        Loengard has been reduced to sheer animal fright. MIB #2
        aims his weapon.  The GUN CLICKS.

        Loengard's knees give out and the MIB holding him supports
      his limp body.  Bach moves closer.

                                        BACH
                        Keep your nose out of our business,
                        Mister Loengard.  Or next time, we
                        make a house call.  And Kimberly
                        can join us.

        Bach moves away but MIB #2 lingers.

                                        MIB #2
                        Lucky for you, college boy, the man
                        says you get to stay up late this
                        time.

      MIB #2 clearly enjoys punching Loengard in the stomach,
        knocking the wind out of him, leaving him on his knees,
        gasping for breath.

      The MIB load into the aircraft, which we now see is ominous
        indeed, but of earthly origin.  It is an ALL-BLACK
        HELICOPTER!  With no markings whatsoever.

        Loengard, filled with terror at what he has stumbled into,
      can only watch helplessly, as the helicopter lifts off and
      we:


                                                                                  FADE OUT.

                                            ACT TWO

        FADE IN:

      EXT. CAPITOL HILL - DAY

      To ESTABLISH winter.  People bundled up, trudging through
      the snow.  Loengard watches them pensively, afraid to go
        inside.  His attention is drawn to:

      AN OVERHEAD HELICOPTER

        It's a normal chopper, unlike the black one we encountered
        last night.

        LOENGARD

        Filled with dread, he joins the other workers and heads up
      the stairs.

      INT. CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE - DAY

        Loengard, no longer his unflappable self, takes off his
        jacket and hangs it over the side of his cubicle.  WE SEE
      now that he's moved in, having cut out and taped up dozens
      of newspaper articles about JFK's legislative victories.
        Loengard notices a manila envelope with his name on it laid
      on his desk.  Loengard cautiously opens it to find:

        A REPORT

      To: Charles Pratt.  From: John Loengard.  Subject: "PROJECT
        BLUE BOOK."  Flipping through it, WE SEE this is a well-
        researched document, including budget charts dating back to
        1952.  The final page is even signed by John Loengard.  As
        Loengard reads the conclusive "Summary":

      CU - LOENGARD

      His confounded reaction says it all: he didn't write this.
        Suddenly, a hand slaps down on his shoulder.

        LOENGARD

        Whirls around, spooked.  Simonson takes the memo from
        Loengard's hand before he can react.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Man, Loengard.  Don't you sleep?  I
                        was going to give you to the end of
                        the week to finish this.

        Simonson starts flipping through the document.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Mark, can I get that back, please?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT24.

        Simonson won't hand it over.  With growing apprehension
        Loengard watches Simonson reach the back page, stop
        abruptly, and fix on the "Summary" section.  Incredulously,
      he begins to read out loud.

                                        SIMONSON
                                  (reading)
                        In summary, 'Project Blue Book' is
                        not only a viable organization, but
                          a detailed cost analysis shows this
                        program to be an insubstantial line
                        item cut?
                                  (eyes Loengard)
                        Pretty bold for your first memo.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You don't understand.
                                  (lowers voice)
                        I didn't write that.

      OFF Simonson's baffled expression.

      INT. CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

        Simonson moves to the lone window in the room.  As he closes
      the blinds:

                                        SIMONSON
                        Black helicopters, wiretaps.  Do
                        you have any idea what you stumbled
                        onto, Loengard?

                                        LOENGARD
                        The Hills definitely saw something.
                        What it was, I don't know.

                                        SIMONSON
                                  (nods in agreement)
                        Probably some secret weapon we're
                        going to surprise the Russians
                        with.

                        In New Hampshire?

                                        SIMONSON
                        Test flight?  I don't know.  But
                        this explains all those stories
                        I've heard about the Black Ops
                        Budget.

                                        LOENGARD
                        What?  I've never heard of that.

                                        SIMONSON
                          Operations that don't show up in
                        the budget.  Somebody's diverting
                        funds, Loengard.  And you caught
                        them red-handed.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT25.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I didn't catch anybody, Mark.  They
                        caught me.  And I think these guys
                        are killers.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Face it.  If they were, you
                        wouldn't be here.  They just wanted
                        to scare you.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Well, they did.

                                        SIMONSON
                        So consider this your chance to get
                        even.

        Simonson pats Loengard, whose resistance is waning, on the
        shoulder.

                                        LOENGARD
                        We don't even know who they are ...

                                        SIMONSON
                        You said they called him 'Captain.'
                        Probably talking Air Force.  Only
                          Captain's just one lousy rung above
                          Lieutenant, which doesn't make
                        sense at all.

        Loengard snaps his fingers.

                                        LOENGARD
                        He's Navy.  My cousin's in the
                        Navy.  It's the only branch of the
                        Armed Forces with different
                          rankings.  In the Navy, Captain
                        means Colonel, which is right up
                        there.

                                        SIMONSON
                        That's good, Loengard.

        Startling them both, Pratt pokes his head into the
        conference room.

                                        PRATT
                        What the hell's going on, Simonson?
                        Or does my ten o'clock briefing
                        start at ten-thirty these days?

        Simonson subtly slides the report back into the envelope.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Just going over Loengard's trip,
                          Congressman.  I'll be right in.

                                (to Loengard)
                        So this 'Blue Book' worth its salt?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT26.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Working on the report now, sir.

                                        PRATT
                        I hate to wait ...

        Pratt grunts and disappears, leaving the door open.
        Loengard whispers to Simonson.

                                        LOENGARD
                        What do we do about --
                                  (indicates report)
                        -- this?

        Simonson checks to make sure Pratt's out of earshot, then
        turns back to Loengard.

                                        SIMONSON
                        We do nothing.

                                        LOENGARD
                          Nothing?!  You heard him.  He wants
                        it now.

                                        SIMONSON
                        This is our chance, Loengard. To
                        score some points for us, not
                        him.
                                  (beat)
                        I'll stall the farmer.  You find
                        out why a Navy Captain is so
                          interested in 'flying saucers.
                        But, whatever you do, keep your
                        head down.

        Simonson closes the door, leaving Loengard alone.  He takes
        a deep breath, preparing for the work ahead.

        MONTAGE

        Showing Loengard attacking his research.

      A) At a table in the Library of Congress, Loengard is
        surrounded by a stack of books related to flying saucers.

      B) Checking out a box of files from a Congressional storage
        office.  One of them states: Personnel / Naval Intelligence.
        A MIB lurks in the background, observing.

      C) In a room filled with stacks and stacks of old
        newspapers, Loengard pulls one out of the pile.  It is a
        July 1947 issue of the San Francisco Examiner about the
        recovery of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico.

      D) Loengard, in an open suburban garage, goes through a
        military trunk.  Amidst some documents, he happens across a
        memo with the words "TOP SECRET / MAJIC" on top.  A kindly
        widow enters, carrying two slices of fruit cake.  Across the
        street, WE SEE a MIB photographing him from a parked car.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT27.

      E) Sitting cross-legged on the floor of his apartment,
        Loengard flips through a pile of Navy Cadet Yearbooks while
        Sayers paints a piece of furniture.  She playfully drips
        paint onto his yellow legal pad.

      F) Loengard approaches Simonson, slaps a military newspaper
      on his desk.  He flips it open to a specific page.  There is
        a photo of a Captain named Frank Bach.

      INT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

        Loengard stands before the mirror, combing his hair.  Over
        this, we hear:

                                        SAYERS (O.S.)
                        John, what time is it?

        Loengard looks out toward the TV which is on in the living
        room featuring Hugh Downs of the "Today Show."

                                        LOENGARD
                        They're about to do the news.
                        Close to eight, I think.

        Sayers enters.

                                        SAYERS
                        How do I look?

        Laengard studies Sayers in a business suit ensemble and make
      up.  She looks elegant, yet still the picture of
          All-American innocence.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Like you're going somewhere.  Are
                        you?

      She adjusts her earrings, having fun with him.

                                        SAYERS
                        Oh, nowhere you'd care about.  Just
                        the White House.

      INT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

        Loengard tracks after Sayers, a look of shock on his face.
      WE SEE how much work Sayers has put into making the place
        more livable.  It's minimalist, but tasteful and classy
        wherever possible.  Sayers takes the opportunity to gloat.

                                        SAYERS
                        Remember that lunch with Lisa
                        Bentley you said was going to be
                        such a waste?  Well, she knew
                        Barbara Collins who I called who
                        referred me to Jennifer Ruehmann
                        who knows Alicia Burnside who's the
                          assistant to the First Lady.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT28.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Another ruthless power grab. I
                        wish I'd called Lisa Bentley.

                                        SAYERS
                        You can see her tonight.  We're
                        making lasagna.  If you're good,
                        you can have some ...

        Sayers takes a look at the stacks of paperwork Loengard has
        scattered all over the dining room table.  The "Today Show"
      is on TV.

                                        SAYERS (CONT'D)
                        And you could give us a place to
                        eat by taking some of this back to
                        the office.

                                        LOENGARD
                                  (awkward)
                        I'll clean up but ... this is
                        really 'extra credit.'  I've got an
                        angle on something I haven't told
                          everybody at work about yet.

                                        SAYERS
                        Just don't go overboard, John.  I
                        know how you can be.  You never
                        know when to quit.

                                        LOENGARD
                        That's what they told Kennedy when
                        he was investigating labor
                          racketeering.  Didn't hurt his
                        career.

      The PHONE RINGS.  As Sayers grabs her watch off the kitchen
        counter, Loengard answers the phone.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Hello?

                                        SAYERS
                        I gotta go.  Wish me luck.

        Sayers smiles, kisses Loengard, takes off. Loengard changes
        channels on the television.

        LOENGARD'S POV - TELEVISION

        BLACK AND WHITE NEWS FOOTAGE of Francis Gary Powers walking
        toward us across a bridge.  Another man with his back to us
        walks in the opposite direction.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DFAFT29.

                        -- the February 10th spy exchange.
                        That's Lieutenant Francis Gary
                        Powers, the American U2 pilot shot
                        down over the Soviet Union two
                        years ago, walking across the
                          Glienicker Bridge toward freedom in
                        West Berlin.  He's passing Soviet
                        spy Colonel Rudolph Abel heading
                        toward the Communist-held Potsdam
                        sector of East Berlin.

        During the exchange, Powers is escorted by none other than
        Frank Bach!

                                        SIMONSON
                        That's your Captain Bach, isn't it?

        Loengard can't believe his eyes.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Yeah.  That's him.

                        Mark, we gotta get to Powers.  He
                        had to be involved in this, too.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Stop right there.  If Powers is
                          involved, so is the President.  Who
                        do you think made the deal with
                          Khrushchev?

                                        LOENGARD
                        Wow.  This isn't just some military
                        budget scandal anymore.

                                        SIMONSON
                        That's the understatement of the
                        year.  This is quicksand, Loengard.
                        Plain and simple.

                                        LOENGARD
                        But Mark, this is the break we've
                        been waiting for.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT30.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Not me.  I've got a wife and kids.
                        I'm out.  It's over.  You hear me?
                        It's over.

        Loengard listens to Simonson HANG UP on him.  His mind
        racing, he slowly replaces the receiver.  Motionless for a
        moment, Loengard starts throwing his things together in
        haste.

      INT. HALLS OF CONGRESS - DAY

        Loengard hurries down the hallway.  He sees something that
        stops him in his tracks.

        It's Bach, in a close huddle with Francis Gary Powers.
        Several uniformed military officers stand a respectful
        distance away.

        Loengard instinctively ducks into an open doorway.  He peeks
        out.  He can't hear what they're talking about, but it's
        clear from the body language that Bach is briefing Powers.

        After a moment, Powers nods, "got it."  Suddenly, the group
      is engulfed by several TV crews and a contingent of print
      and radio REPORTERS, shouting questions.

                                        REPORTER #1
                        You had a poison needle.  Why
                        didn't you use it?

        Bach nods to Powers who backs off.  Powers holds up a hand
      to quiet the uproar, then replies:

                                        POWERS
                        During everything I did or said
                        over the past two years, I kept the
                        best interests of the United States
                        in mind.  I look forward to telling
                        the U-S Senate my side of this
                        story.  Thank you.

        Despite more yelling and questioning, Powers pushes through
        into a door marked, "Senate Armed Services Committee."  A
        sign has been posted, "Closed Session."

        While some reporters seem to scramble for phones, others
        settle back into the wait mode on the hallway seating.

        Bach takes a seat on a bench and lights a cigarette.

      WE SEE Loengard, back against the wall, eyes closed, trying
      to slow his racing heart.  Finally, he sucks in a deep
        breath, sits down next to Bach, who regards him briefly.

                                        LOENGARD
                        There's a new report from the

                        I'm a member of the congressional
                        staff.  You can't rough me up here

                        So how's the 'extra credit' going,
                        John?

        Loengard flinches at Bach's inside knowledge but fires back
        some of his own.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Not bad, Cantain Bach.  I don't
                        know exactly who you work for now,
                        but I'm pretty close to the truth.

        Bach exhales slowly, takes the measure of the man sitting
        next to him.

                                        BACH
                        The truth is overrated.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Maybe.  But what you're doing can't
                        stay hidden forever.

                        Your faith in the power of Congress
                        is charming.

        Bach gets up, stubs out his cigarette on the floor and moves
        away.  Loengard follows after him, determined.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I've read about Roswell.  I've
                        heard about 'Project Sign' and
                        'Project Grudge.'  I know a lot
                        more than you think I do.

                        outer space.  You're building them,
                        aren't you?

        Bach grabs Loengard by the shoulder.  He reaches inside his
        jacket and removes the "subpoena."  It's a dry cleaning
        receipt.

                                        BACH
                        You really got an iron set of 'em,
                        don't you, son?

        Bach crumples up the receipt.  Loengard holds direct eye
        contact.

                                        LOENGARD

                        You understand Mister Loengard,
                        that truth has a price.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I have to know.

      INT. UNION STATION - DAY

        Bach leads Loengard through a crowd of passengers.  They
        reach a set of stairs and head down.  There is a door marked
        "Employees Only."  Bach unlocks it, holds the door for
        Loengard who hesitates.

                                        BACH
                        You already decided to go through
                        this door.  Don't act like you have
                        to think about it.

        Loengard enters:

      INT. ANTEROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

      In the back is another door.  Bach opens it and rather than
        lead to another room, a set of elevator doors open.
        Loengard sees a revolver strapped under Bach's suit jacket.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Are you going to kill me?

                                        BACH
                        Not unless I have to.

        Bach steps inside.  Is he kidding or not?  A beat, then
        Loengard follows.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT33.

      INT. MAJESTIC HEADQUARTERS - OPERATIONS HUB - DAY

      The elevator doors open.  Bach leads Loengard out to a
        security check-point.  A military guard salutes Bach.

                                        BACH
                        Search him.  I.D. him.  Log him in.

        LOENGARD'S POV - THE CONTROL AREA

      His perspective reveals it's only one section of an
        enormous, bunker with high-ceilings and attached corridors.
        A number of people are hard at work.  This is where Powers
      was tracked into the Soviet Union earlier.

                                        BACK TO SCENE

        Loengard is being patted down and fingerprinted.  Scared and
        thrilled simultaneously.

                                        BACH
                        This is Majestic.

                                        LOENGARD
                          Majestic-Twelve?
                                (off Bach's reaction)
                        I found a memo from back when
                        Truman was president.  But it never
                        said what it was.

                                        BACH
                        That was all supposed to have been
                        swept up long ago.

      INT. MAJESTIC HDQS. - CORRIDOR - DAY

        Bach is waiting in the driver's seat of an electric utility
        vehicle.  A MIB shuts a double-thick door behind Loengard
      who slowly gets in the vehicle.  Bach drives down the
        corridor.  They approach a door where a MIB stands, holding
        a large, black attache case. An MP stands next to him.  Bach
        drives up.  Bach takes a key from his pocket, uses it to
        unlock a metal handcuff connecting the attache case to the
        MIB.  He accepts the attache case and continues on.

                                        LOENGARD
                        So where are you taking me?

                                        BACH
                        You said you wanted the truth ...

        Bach points to the end of the corridor.

        INT. MAJESTIC HDQS. - SURGICAL/STORAGE CHAMBER - DAY

        Lights flick on to illuminate the room.  Bach closeS the
        door behind them.  A rectangular stainless steel table,
        waist high, is the centerpiece.  Built into the walls are
        large drawers with handles.  Bach sets the attache case on
      the table.

                                        BACH
                        When I was your age, I had my
                        sights set on Admiral.  But a
                        covert Navy incident unexpectedly
                        landed me at our only nuclear
                        bomber base.  Roswell.

                                        LOENGARD
                        So those stories ... they're all
                        true.

        Bach opens the attache case, begins sifting through its
        contents.  The lid obscures Loengard's view.

                                        BACH
                        Nothing is all true.  It depends
                        who you ask.  If you asked Mac
                        Brazel what crashed on his farm on
                        July the third, 1947, there was a
                        time when he would've told you it
                        was one of these ships.

        Bach places a black-and-white photo of a crashed disc-shaped
        saucer in front of Loengard.

                                        LOENGARD
                        The news said he changed his mind.
                        That it was really a weather
                        balloon.

                                        BACH
                        The news is irrelevant.

        Bach tosses down more photos for Loengard's perusal.  Most
      are of the saucer object seen by Francis Gary Powers.

                                        BACH (CONT'D)

                        We don't make these.

      The photographs are distinct in their clarity and precision.
        Sifting through them all, Loengard is absolutely stupefied.

                        We confiscate all physical evidence
                        before they get to it.

                                        LOENGARD
                        So 'Blue Book' is only what, a
                        front for ... 'Majestic?'

        Bach nods, removes a chain from around his neck.  Rather
        than dog tags, the chain holds a thin container in the shape
      of a matchbox.

                                        BACH
                        Go ahead.  Open it.

          Reluctantly, Loengard slides the top off the container.
        Inside, there appears to be a folded, foil triangle. Slowly,
        Loengard extracts the material.  IT MAGICALLY UNFOLDS AND
        FLATTENS INTO THE SHAPE OF A LARGE TRIANGLE!

        Startled, Loengard drops the material, which floats
        impossibly in mid-air, defying gravity.  He touches a
        corner, setting it spinning.  Then, Bach snatches the
        triangle, shoves it back into his container.

                                        BACH (CONT'D)
                        I wear this to remind me that
                        whoever does build these ships,
                        their knowledge is formidable.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You think it's the Russians?

        Bach leaves the table and begins spinning a combination lock
      on a wall of drawers.

                                        BACH
                        You tell me, Mister Loengard --

        Bach slides the refrigerated drawer open.  The frosty air
        clears to reveal a sealed body bag, which Bach unzips.

                                        BACH (CONT'D)
                        -- does this look Russian to you?

      The now open bag reveals the preserved remains of a "Gray."
        Curled into a near-fetal position, the Gray's head is
        distinguished primarily by the large, black almond-shaped
        eyes that seem to pull you inside and swallow you up.

        Loengard reels, takes a couple of steps back and starts
        gagging.  He hits the wall and slides to his knees, fighting
        nausea.

                                        BACH (CONT'D)
                        Don't be embarrassed.  Most people
                        have trouble digesting the truth.

        Bach goes about returning the photos to their respective
        files, and the files to the attache case.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT36.

                        about this to anyone outside.  It's
                        a very exclusive club.

                        was another knock at the door.

        Bach produces a dossier labeled "Loengard, John."  It has a
        collection of photos of Loengard in his investigation (from
      the montage).  He shows it to Loengard.

        Loengard and Simonson cut a path through the columns,
        talking animatedly.  A SUPER reads:

                        Look, If you want, I can go over to
                        the Library of Congress and see
                        what they have on this new Medicare

                                        LOENGARD
                          I haven't had time to watch a lot
                        of TV lately.

                                        SIMONSON
                        You can't trust Casey.  You know he
                        wants that other doctor, Maggie,
                        but he won't make a move on her.
                        Now why is that?

                                        LOENGARD
                        I don't know.  He's probably got a
                        lot on his mind.

                                        SIMONSON
                        I'm going back to 'Kildare.'

        During Simonson's response, Loengard sees MIB #5 tailing
      the two of them.

                        From a distance, it must have
                        appeared as though nothing had
                        changed.  Bach insisted I keep my
                        day job, but he made it clear I was
                        on call to 'Majestic.'

                                        LOENGARD
                        Uh, Mark, I'm gonna take care of
                        that research right now.  I'll see
                        you back at the office.

        Loengard peels off.  Simonson shrugs, continues on.  From a
        distance, Simonson observes Loengard and the MIB talking.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT39.

        BEHIND THE COLUMN

      MIB #5 pulls a plane ticket from his coat, hands it to
        Loengard.

                        This is only one way.  When am I
                        coming back?

      MIB #5 then turns and walks away.

                                        LOENGARD
                        What am I doing!?  What's the job!?

      No answers.  Loengard is left staring apprehensively at the
        ticket.

      INT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

      The BLACK-AND-WHITE VIDEOTAPE of Jackie Kennedy's White
        House Tour.

                          Historical preservation is one of
                        the things we have felt the White
                        House should properly be involved in,
                          especially with so many
                          artifacts hidden away ...

      We are really in:

      INT. WHITE HOUSE - GREEN ROOM - NIGHT

        Where Sayers stands transfixed looking at a small BLACK-AND-
        WHITE MONITOR of the First Lady's presentation.  She is next
      to a network cameraman manning a huge, cumbersome studio
        camera.  ALICIA BURNSIDE, Sayers' pretty-but-pushy boss,
        enters in a hurry, motions Sayers aside.

                                        ALICIA
                        Honey, I hope all kinds of people
                        are watching tonight but hopefully
                        not the ones I'm paying.

        Sayers nods, embarrassed.

                                        SAYERS
                        I'm sorry, really.  It's just that
                        she's so good.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT40.

                        Mrs. Kennedy has more class in her
                        little pinkie than all the TV
                        people running around here
                          combined.
                                (all business)
                        Now, get to it.  They're coming
                        here after the third break.

      The phone RINGS.  Alicia rushes to answer it.

                                        ALICIA (CONT'D)
                        Burnside ...  No.  This is a bad
                        time ...  He is?

        Alicia hangs up, turns to Sayers.

                                        ALICIA (CONT'D)
                        I don't know how but your boyfriend
                        talked his way inside.  Apparently,
                        it's an emergency.

        Alicia heads for the door, glances at her watch.

                                        ALICIA (CONT'D)
                        Make it quick, sweetie.

        After Alicia leaves, Sayers and the cameraman eye each other
        warily.  Finally, Loengard enters through the back door,
        escorted by a SECRET SERVICE AGENT.

                                        SAYERS
                        John, what's happened?  Did someone
                        die?

                                        LOENGARD
                        No, Kim, look, I'm getting sent out
                        of town again.

                                        SAYERS
                        Why are you telling me this now?

                                        LOENGARD
                        Because I wanted to see you before
                        I left.  There's some things you
                        should know.  You remember the
                        'extra credit?'

                                        SAYERS
                        We can talk about this at home.

        Loengard grabs Sayers by the arms, speaks intently.  He
        needs to tell her the truth.

                                        LOENGARD
                        No.  I'm on my way to the airport.

        Sayers pulls away.  This draws looks from the cameraman and
        Secret Service agent.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT41.

                                        SAYERS
                        All right, John.  But we have to
                        make this fast.

        Loengard realizes he cannot continue without endangering her.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You know what?  This is a mistake.
                        We can talk about it later.

                                        SAYERS
                        John, you came here to say
                          something.  So say it.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Look, I'll call you tomorrow.

        Loengard looks at the Secret Service agent who seems ready
      to intervene.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        Relax, I'm going.

        Loengard heads for the door.

                                        SAYERS
                        John, don't --

      INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

        More BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE from the actual tour.

                        ... the East Room renovation is an
                          interesting mixture of traditional
                        Greek, and Mississippi River Boat.

        Only now, on this same vintage videotape, WE SEE Loengard
        walking through an open door, only to find himself like a
        deer in the headlights, caught in the glare of television
        lights standing behind the First Lady.  After freezing for a
        moment, he backs out of the room.

      EXT. BOISE AIRPORT - NIGHT

        Loengard descends the steps of a small commuter plane
        directly onto the tarmac.  He and a handful of travelers
        hurry for the warmth of the terminal.  A sign informs us we
      are at "Boise Air Terminal."

      INT. BOISE AIRPORT - NIGHT

        Loengard scans the deserted terminal looking for anyone
        familiar.  Finally, he takes a seat.  He sits down and pulls
        a D.C. newspaper from a travel bag.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT42.

        INSERT   NEWSPAPER

      The front page headline reads: "NASA: GLENN GOOD TO GO!"
        Loengard flips right to the sports page.  Suddenly, a hand
        grabs the paper and lowers it, revealing:

      MIB #2

        This is really JIM STEELE, the piece of bad news who
        punched Loengard in the New Hampshire field.  Loengard
        offers his hand but MIB#2/STEELE just walks away.

        Loengard grabs his two suitcases and follows.  Steele gives
      him a disgusted look.

                                        MIB #2/STEELE
                        You pack like a girl.

        EXT./INT. HELICOPTER - NEXT DAY

        Loengard is seated in the rear of the chopper with three
        MIB, including Steele.  No one talks.  Loengard takes out a
        stick of gum and starts chewing.  He offers the pack to the
      MIB but gets no takers.  It's clear they regard Loengard
        with great suspicion.  From the cockpit area, Bach climbs
        back to speak to the others.

                        Outside!  Nine o'clock!

        Loengard and the MIB push against the window and stare down
      at:

        HELICOPTER POV - CROP CIRCLE

        Nearly a mile below, covering sections of a wheat fIeld and
      the dirt road bisecting it, is a massive otherworldly
        pictogram.  The design is intricate.  Definitely not
        something made by Nother Nature.

        INTERCUT:  INSIDE HELICOPTER / HELICOPTER POv

        Loengard is chilled by this eerie image.

        Bach smiles, turns calmly to Loengard.

                        John, tell Mister Steele two things
                        from your personal life.  Make one
                        of them a lie.

        Loengard, caught off-guard, sees that Bach is not joking.
      He turns away for a moment, then turns back to MIB #2/Steele
      and says, without blinking:

                                        LOENGARD
                        I was a starter on the football
                        team my junior year of high school.
                        That same year I kissed a black
                        girl at a party.

      MIB #2/Steele keeps his unblinking gaze drilling back into
        Loengard.

        Loengard takes another look outside at the eerie pictogram.

                        Have we ever seen one of these
                        before?

        Bach and the MIB trade knowing glances.  MIB #2/Steele
        flicks a spent cigarette butt in his direction.

                        I still say he's not ready, Frank.

        Bach unwinds the string around a clasp on an envelope marked
        "Above Top Secret."  He slides out a photo.

                                        BACH
                        This is a piece of the broken I-
                        beam from the Roswell crash.

        Bach hands the photo to Loengard.  The I-beam has a series
      of pictogram's running along it.  One of them is a dead
        match for the pictogram in the wheat field.

                        haven't seen it for a long time.

      INT. CATTLE BARON MOTEL - DAY

        Amidst cluttered Majestic paraphernalia, MIB #1 (POPEJOY)
        wires Loengard with a concealed microphone unit.

      MIB #1/Popejoy pivots Loengard, unbuttons a couple of
        buttons from his shirt and adjusts the microphone and the
        tape.  Nods to Loengard for another check.

                        could do it.

      MIB #1/Popejoy winks at Loengard, who forces an uncertain
        smile as he heads for:

                        My girlfriend.  She thinks I'm out
                        of town on government business.

        Bach eyes him, asks slowly:

                                        BACH
                        And you told your office ..?

        Bach allows a smile as he towels off his face, then picks up
      the chain and container from the sink and replaces it
        around his neck.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT46.

                        You tell everyone the same story.
                        You keep it simple and you stick
                        to it.
                                (pat on shoulder)
                        I'm sure you'll work it out.  But
                        don't worry.  We'll take care of
                        Pratt for you this time.

        Loengard nods, uncertain.

      INT. WHITE HOUSE - ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - DAY

      EXT. CATTLE BARON MOTEL - DAY

        Loengard stands in a pay phone, looking at a wallet-size
        photo of Sayers.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Look, Kim, I'm sorry about last
                        night, but I'm not going to lie to

        Loengard bites his lip, preparing to tell his first big lie.

                        Not exactly.  It's Pratt.  Turns
                        out he's got some ... mistress ...
                        back in Fresno.  The papers are on

                                        LOENGARD
                        The main reason I called, Kim, is,
                        well, you just can't call the
                        office.  Most of them don't know

                        Thanks for the update, John, but
                        I've got to go.

        Loengard hangs up, terribly conflicted as he slowly moves to
        join Bach and the MIB.

      EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

        Loengard stands at the front door knocking, gets no answer.
      He wanders over to the nearby ramshackle red barn, where a
        pickup truck, hood up, is parked inside.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Hello!?  Anybody home!?

      INT. BARN - DAY

        MUSIC from a transistor radio plays inside the shadowy barn.
        Loengard enters, looking around.  As he wanders off into a
        forbodingly dark area:

                                        LOENGARD
                        Hello?  Mister Grantham?

        Loengard hears a sound behind him and whirls around to find
        ELLIOT GRANTHAM, a life-long farmer, standing there with a
        large screwdriver held threateningly in hand.

                                        GRANTHAM
                        Who wants to know?

        Startled and insecure about his cover, Loengard points out
      his badge.

                        My name's Fred Graber.  From the

                                        GRANTHAM
                        I didn't call you.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT48.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Well, no sir, you didn't.  My
                        office got a call saying there's
                        some kind of strange formation in
                        your field.  They sent me out to
                          investigate.

        Grantham turns away.

                                        GRANTHAM
                        I ain't talking about it.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        You may want to change your mind
                        about that.  The law says if you've
                        incurred any kind of crop loss as a
                        result of that vandalism, and I
                        have to assume this is vandalism,
                        then my office is obligated to
                        inform you that you qualify for
                          government subsidies.

                                        GRANTHAM
                        You mean you'd pay me money?

                                        LOENGARD
                        That's right.  'Course I'd have to
                        go out and take a look at it
                        myself.

        Grantham eyeballs Loengard long and hard.  He wipes his
        hands on a grease rag.

                                        GRANTHAM
                        Field's too far for walkin' .  We'll
                        take the truck.

        Grantham slams the hood shut and we, cut to:

      EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DAY

        Grantham's pick up truck putters down a dirt road, cresting
      at the top of a small valley.  Down below we see the crop
        marking.

      The truck stops and Loengard hops out.  He takes a look at
      the discolored dirt on the road, then wanders over to a wire
        fence.  Following the line of the marking, matching sections
      of the barbed wire have virtually disappeared.

        INSERT - THE BARBED WIRE

        Appears to have been dissolved.  A touch to the rusted end
        causes the metal to flake away like ash.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT49.

        BACK TO SCENE

      As Loengard trudges further out into the wheat field,
        Grantham watches on from inside the cab, answering questions
        hrough the rolled down window.

                                        LOENGARD
                                  (sotto; into mic)
                        This thing is huge ...

        Loengard kneels down and inspects the uniformly matted wheat
        stalks.  He plucks one from the ground.  It's darker, almost
        discolored on the side facing up.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        Mister Grantham, do you remember
                        the first time you saw this?

                                        GRANTHAM
                        Last week maybe.  It's winter
                        wheat, Mister Graber.  You don't do
                        much this time of year 'cept let it
                        grow.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Why didn't you report it?

                                        GRANTHAM
                        No law says I got to.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You see any strange lights in the
                        sky over the last month or two?

                                        GRANTHAM
                        Why?  You seen some?

      But Loengard isn't answering.  He's out in the middle of the
        formation now.  He bends down on one knee to inspect it.

                                        LOENGARD
                                  (sotto; into mic)
                        The stalks are laid down perfectly.
                        Not even broken.

        Loengard now wanders further out.  He's about fifty yards
        away from the truck when he steps on something.  Kicking the
        wheat away, Loengard exposes a small, triangular metal plate.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        I found something!

        Down on his hands and knees, Loengard whisks away the dirt
      to reveal a pictogram which is a derivation of the larger
        crop circle design itself.

        Loengard holds it up for inspection.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT50.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        It's that picture again.  And this
                        thing's made of gold!

      The sound of Grantham's TRUCK STARTING diverts Loengard's
        attention.  He looks up to see Grantham gunning the engine,
        barreling toward him.  Loengard runs, dives into the full
        wheat field.

      INT. SEDAN - DAY

        Inside, Bach and the three MIB hear Loengard and hit the
        road at full speed.

                                        LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        Help!  He's trying to kill me!

      EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DAY

        Grantham takes another run at Loengard.  He sees the sedan
        approaching fast.  SHOTS are fired at him.  Grantham's pick-
      up heads off down another dirt road.

      The sedan is hot on Grantham's tail.  When the car gets
        close enough, MIB #2/STEELE leans out the passenger side
        window, pistol trained with both hands -- BLAM! BLAM!

        GRANTHAN'S REAR TIRE BLOWS!

        Grantham's truck lists onto the road's dirt shoulder and
        fishtails out of control.  Then it traverses unexpectedly
        back across the road, cutting off the SKIDDING sedan.
        Finally:

      THE TRUCK CRASHES HEADFIRST INTO A TREE!

        Bach and the MIB climb from the sedan and cautiously
        approach the smashed pick up.  Bach takes a long look inside
      the cracked driver's window, then reholsters his gun.  It's
        over.

      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

        A DOCTOR stands with Bach and Loengard at the bedside of
        Grantham.  Both his legs are in casts, his head is heavily
        bandaged and a plethora of tubes and wires connect him to
        faltering life support equipment.  Grantham's eyes are
        closed.

                        In addition to the physical injury,
                        he's suffered severe head trauma.
                                  (compassionately; to Bach)
                        I'm afraid your brother may not
                        make it.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT51.

                                        BACH
                        Do you mind if I give the boy a
                        private moment with his uncle?  He
                          practically raised him while I was
                        in the service.

        Bach leads the doctor outside the door.  Loengard watches
        them go, then moves close to Grantham.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Can you hear me, Mister Grantham?

      It takes a moment, but Grantham opens his eyes, stares at
        Loengard.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        Mister Grantham, I work with some
                        people who have reason to believe
                        that your farm was the site of a
                          visitation by alien beings.  They
                        think you know something about
                        that.  If you talk to me, maybe I
                        can help you.

        Grantham's lips start to quiver.  At first, no sound is
        produced. Then a queer, HI-PITCHED RASP hisses forth.  Soon,
        Grantham is muttering a four word phrase in some STRANGE,
        INDECIPHERABLE LANGUAGE.  He repeats it twice.  Then smiles.
        A crooked, malignant smile.  Which soon gives way to
        HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.  Loengard shakes him.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        Get it out, Mister Grantham!  Tell
                        me what's happening!

        Within moments Grantham is convulsing.  Bach and the doctor
        race back into the room.  The doctor takes a look, calls out
        into the hallway.

                                        DOCTOR
                        Code Blue!  We've got a Code Blue
                        in here!

        Loengard steps away from the bed and watches a choreographed
        life-saving intervention as the medical staff tries
        desperately to save Grantham.  MEDICAL CROSS-TALK and
        TECHNICAL DIALOGUE.

        Finally, however, all we hear is the telltale DEATH-TONE of
      the EKG machine.  The doctor turns to Bach:

                                        DOCTOR
                        I'm sorry.
                                (to nurse)
                        Let's call it for 12:53 am.

        While the doctor continues to dictate details of the death
        certificate to the nurse, Loengard moves over Grantham,
        studying him closely.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT52.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Excuse me, doctor.  Why are his
                        eyes still moving?

      The doctor leans in, has a look.  Sure enough Grantham's
        eyeballs are darting back and forth underneath fluttering
        eyelids.

                                        DOCTOR
                        Hmmm ... looks like rapid eye
                          movement.  It's supposed to mean
                        you're dreaming.

                                        BACH
                        Is he dead or isn't he?

                                        DOCTOR
                        I'm afraid this is some kind of
                        unusual autonomic response, but he
                        is definitely dead.  I probably
                        should order up a full autopsy.

        Bach gestures to a couple of MIB watching from the hallway.
        They swarm the doctor.

                                        BACH
        That won't be necessary.  We'll be taking the body with us.

      INT. MAJESTIC HDQS. - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      MIB #1/Popejoy and MIB #2/Steele crash a gurney carrying
        Grantham's body quickly through a doorway into the hallway.
        Bach walks briskly alongside, Loengard keeping in step.
        They are met by DR. CARL HERTZOG, lead scientist for
        Majestic.

                                        HERTZOG
                        I've prepared for the dissection
                        but I can't locate the other team
                        members at this hour.  Maybe by
                        morning.

                                        BACH
                        We can't afford to wait.

                                        HERTZOG
                        Why not?  Who is this man?

                                        BACH
                        That's what we intend to find out.

                        Now.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT53.

      INT. MAJESTIC HDQS. - SURGICAL/STORAGE CHAMBER - NIGHT

      An autopsy in progress.  Bach, Loengard, Popejoy and Steele
        surround the body of Elliot Grantham.  Hertzog, surgical
        scrubs stained, uses his gloved hands to deliver a human
        liver to a scale and notes the weight.

                                        HERTZOG
                        The subject has an enlarged liver
                        which indicates some form of prior
                        alcohol abuse.  Otherwise, the
                        internal organs appear to be
                          unremarkable for a man his age.

        Hertzog returns to the table, looks at Grantham's open body.

                                        HERTZOG (CONT'D)
                        No cancers, no surgeries.  Just an
                        ordinary man.

        Bach gestures dismissively.

                                        BACH
                          'Ordinary' men don't try to run
                        down complete strangers with their
                        pick-up trucks.

        Hertzog picks up a cranial buzz saw.

                                        HERTZOG
                        We can remove the cranial cap.  See
                        about a tumor ...

                                        BACH
                        Do it.

        Hertzog shrugs, fires up the WHIR of the buzz saw.  As he
        moves in over the head, penetrating the skull, Popejoy
        shifts uncomfortably, then turns and exits in a hurry.
        Loengard starts to go after him, but Steele grabs his
        sleeve.

                                        MIB #2/STEELE
                        Let him go.

        Loengard pulls free.  He exits the door to the hallway, past
        a couple of military police into the:

        CORRIDOR

        A sign on the wall tells us we are in "Majestic."  Popejoy
        leans against the wall, embarrassed.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You okay?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT54.

                                        MIB #1/POPEJOY
                                  (nods)
                        Will be.  Thanks.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Hey, if we'd wanted to be doctors,
                        we'd have gone to med school,
                        right?

        Popejoy smiles wanly.  Loengard slaps him on the shoulder,
        then moves back inside.

          SURGICAL/STORAGE CHAMBER

      The others are gathered around the head of Grantham.   After
        a small struggle by Hertzog, Bach points at the head area.

                                        BACH
                        What is that, there?

        Hertzog starts to poke around with the instrument.

                                        HERTZOG
                        Some unusual mass.  I've never seen
                        it before.
                                  (pointing)
                        It's engulfing the entire brain
                        stem.  Under there.  I assume this
                        is what killed him.

        Suddenly, Hertzog jumps back from the table, dropping the
        instrument CLANKING on the floor.

                                        HERTZOG (CONT'D)
                        BY GOD, IT MOVED!

        Bach fearlessly takes a close inspection.

                                        BACH
                        Can you extract it without damage?

                                        HERTZOG
                                  (freaking out)
                        TO WHO?  WHAT IS IT?!

        Bach ignores Hertzog's hysteria, goes to the door, speaks
        coolly and professionally to the military police.

                                        BACH
                          Gentlemen, we are now officially
                          Red-Ultra.  Secure the entire
                        sector.
                                (to Popejoy)
                        Popejoy, we'll need the Roswell
                        cranial specimen.  It's in cold
                        storage,  A-three.

        Bach closes the door, turns to Loengard.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT55.

                                        BACH (CONT'D)
                        John, get a container from the work
                        area.  With a lid.

        Hertzog begins to probe and poke at the organism.   Now, for
      the first time, WE SEE:

      CU - THE GANGLION

        Vaguely resembling a dappled jellyfish.  Like a determined
        weed, the ganglion's root structure is extensive.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Hertzog can not get the squirming ganglion to release its
        grip.  Using a set of large tongs, Hertzog redoubles his
        efforts, literally ripping the ganglion from Grantham's
        brain stem -- along with it comes a section of gray matter
        attached to the creature's large, flat sucker.

      THE GANGLION

        Writhes wildly, forcing Hertzog to clutch the tongs with
        both hands.  He can barely control its flagellations.

        Steele trains his weapon on the twitching creature as
        Loengard moves the container into place.

        Hertzog tries to shove the creature inside, but its TENDRILS
        SHOOT UP and hold the lid off the jar.

        Bach and Hertzog force the lid into place.  They sever a
        tendril tip in the process.  All three men crowd around the
        ganglion trapped inside its glass jail.

      CU - THE JAR

      The ganglion is rabid, crazed.  It attaches its sucker to
      the glass.  We see hundreds of yellow teeth-like nodules
        lining the sucker.  And a tongue-like needle which shoots
        forth from its gullet, boring into the jar ... and cracking
      the glass!

                                        BACH (O.S.)
                        Open the storage locker!

        BACK TO SCENE

        Bach grabs up the container and rushes to the storage
        locker, which Loengard throws open.  Bach pushes the jar
        inside, then slams the fridge door closed.  Silence.
        Popejoy returns with the specimen container reguested by
        Bach.

        Inside the storage locker, WE HEAR the JAR BREAK open.
        There is a terrible thrashing inside.

                                        LOENGARD
                        How could that creature get inside
                        him?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DKAFT56.

        Bach takes Popejoy's specimen container.  Inside, floating
      in formaldehyde is another ganglion with an elaborate root
        system of its own.

                                        BACH
                        I don't know.  But whatever it is,
                        it's a dead ringer for this one
                        here.
                                (re: bottled specimen)
                        Only we found this fifteen
                        years ago inside the bodies at
                        the Roswell crash.

                                        HERTZOG
                        I was never told any of this!

                                        BACH
                        You didn't need to know.

                                        LOENGARD
                                  (grave realization)
                        You're saying you found one of
                        these things in an alien ... and
                        now in a human?

        Bach nods at Loengard.

                                        BACH
                        The question is, how many more like
                        Grantham are out there?

      The stakes have just been radically upped, as we:

      INT. CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE - DAY

        Loengard enters, tentatively, continues on to his cubicle.
        It's been emptied of all its contents.  He stops, surprised,
        stares at it.  Simonson approaches.

                                        SIMONSON
                        We're giving your desk to Nelson.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Am I being fired?

                                        SIMONSON
                        Fired?  Hardly.  You're being
                          rewarded.  For what, I'm not quite
                        sure, although I have a few
                          suspicions.

                                        LOENGARD
                                  (wants to come clean)
                        Look, Mark, maybe we should talk.

                                        SIMONSON
                        No thanks.  You made your choice.
                        I made mine.  Your problem is
                        Pratt.  He's fit to be tied and
                        he wants to know everything.
                                  (points)
                        Down there in your new office.  The
                        one with the window.

        Simonson takes off.  Filled with dread, Loengard watches him
      go.

      INT. LOENGARD'S OFFICE - DAY

        Loengard enters, looks around, uncertainly.  Big window,
        real desk, files, pictures.  He is startled by:

                                        PRATT
                        I hope it meets your requirements,
                        John.

        Pratt has entered the office without a sound, scaring the
        hell out of Loengard.  He closes the door.

                                        PRATT (CONT'D)
                        I'd offer my condolences but we
                        both know nobody died.
                                  (pointedly)
                        At least not your uncle.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Sir?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT58.

                                        PRATT
                        Sir.  Your slick little line-of-
                        crap just disgusts me.  So much so
                        I was all ready to fire you.  But
                        then I find out John Loengard's
                          'untouchable.'

                                        LOENGARD
                                  (truly baffled)
                        What are you talking about?

                                        PRATT
                        What am I talking about ..?
                                  (thrusts papers at him)
                        Just blackmail.  That's all.

        Loengard inspects the papers.

        INSERT - PAPERS

        A medical form for Charles Pratt admitting him to a
        sanitarium for treatment for "nervous breakdown."  Attached
      to it is another single-page, typed note which reads:

                                  "LOENGARD'S UNTOUCHABLE."

        BACK TO SCENE

        Loengard simply looks up at Pratt, stunned.

                                        PRATT
                        So what if I had a nervous
                          breakdown?  I'm fine now.  But your
                        friends leak that and Charles
                        Pratt'll never win another
                          election.  Who's behind all this,
                        John?

                        All I can tell you is I'm serving
                        my country --

                                        PRATT
                                  (exploding)
                        By serving me up like a pig on a
                        damned platter!

        Loengard looks away.  Pratt goes to the door, but stops to
        deliver a threat of his own.

                                        PRATT (CONT'D)
                        I may look like a dumb old farmer,
                        but you don't know what you're
                        dealing with.  Whoever your new
                        friends are, John, there are forces
                        out there far more powerful.

        Pratt exits, leaving Loengard alone in his office, looking
      out the window.  Somehow the view no longer holds the
        attraction it once did.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT59.

        A beat, then Loengard slowly removes from a box his sacred
        articles trumpeting the successes of the Kennedy
        administration which had been displayed above his old
        cubicle.  He throws them in the wastebasket.  The phone
        RINGS.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Loengard ... Hey, Kim ...  No, it's
                        going fine.  They gave me a new
                        office, but I got a ton of work to
                        go with it, so I won't be home
                        until late.

      INT. MAJESTIC HEADQUARTERS - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

        Loengard sits with MIB #1/Popejoy and MIB #2/Steele, outside
        a glass window which affords a view of a lab filled with
        various cages and equipment.  Surrounded by lab rats and
        other animals, the largest cage houses a rhesus test monkey
        where Doctor Hertzog extracts a blood sample before taking
        off.  A 16-mm film camera records the scene.  Loengard
        scribbles on a legal pad, while the two MIB talk.

                                        MIB #1/POPEJOY
                        I tell you what.  That monkey
                        starts turning gray, I'm gone.

                                        MIB #2/STEELE
                        I don't know why we have to be here
                        anyway.  Should only take one
                        college boy to watch a monkey.

        Loengard looks up from his notes at MIB #2/Steele.

                                        LOENGARD
                        If you'd gone to college, Steele,
                        you might at least appreciate the
                        problem we've got on our hands.

                                        MIB #2/STEELE
                        You're so smart, that's why Bach
                        had me fix your problem at work.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Figures that was you.  Tell you
                        what, next time let me dig myself
                        out.  Your fix-it job had all the
                        subtlety of a house fire.

      MIB #1/Popejoy, seeing the tension, addresses MIB #2/Steele.

                                        MIB #1/POPEJOY
                        Hey, you know what, Steele, I got
                        this handled.  We still got
                          paperwork from Idaho.  You want to
                        take care of that?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT60.

        Loengard puts his attention back on his notepad.  MIB
        #2/Steele looks like he's about to punch him again, thinks
        better of it, and takes off.  MIB #1/Popejoy checks Loengard
        out.  Finally:

                                        MIB #1/POPEJOY (CONT'D)
                        He is an ass.
                                  (laughs)
                        But I don't think I've ever heard
                        anybody call him on it.

        Loengard takes out his gum, offers a stick to MIB
        #1/Popejoy.  This time, he takes it.

        Hertzog pokes his head into the observation room.  He's
        totally focused on the biological challenge facing him.

                                        HERTZOG
                        I'm running these blood samples
                        down to the lab.  How's our
                          'Profile' going, John?

                                        LOENGARD
                        I'm taking a stab at it, but, other
                        than Grantham, it's all guess work.

                                        HERTZOG
                        That's why we keep an eye on our
                        Simian friend.  It's been thirty-
                        two hours now since the tissue
                        implant.  If anything unusual
                        occurs, please alert me
                          immediately.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You got it, Doc.

        Hertzog takes off.  MIB #1/Popejoy looks over at Loengard's
        legal pad.

                                        #1/POPEJOY
                        I been here three years, Hertzog's
                        never said hello to me.  So what's
                        this thing you two geniuses are
                        working on anyway?

                                        LOENGARD
                        It'sa profile on 'Patient Zero.'
                                (off his look)
                          Grantham, the farmer.  I've got all
                        these testimonials and transcripts
                        from his friends and neighbors.
                        Turns out the guy had a 'missing
                        time' gap like Betty and Barney
                        Hill.
                                        MIB #1/POPEJOY
                        So why haven't we taken a look
                        inside their brains?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT61.

                                        LOENGARD
                        We've got them under surveillance
                        but there's a big difference.
                                  (indicates paperwork)
                        They reported their story.  They
                        weren't trying to hide anything,
                        and they're very nice people.
                        Whereas with Grantham, besides all
                        this, his own wife says he wasn't
                        himself after he was missing.

                                        MIB #1/POPEJOY
                        So they think by putting a piece of
                        that ganglion inside a monkey's
                        brain, they're gonna learn what
                        makes it tick?

                                        LOENGARD
                        It didn't come with a manual.

                                        MIB #l/POPEJOY
                        If you want to know how it works in
                        humans, why inject monkeys?

                                        LOENGARD
                        You volunteering, Popejoy?

                                        MIB #1/POPEJOY
                        Not on your life.

        Loengard and MIB #1/Popejoy smile at each other.  Loengard
        goes back to his work and MIB #1/Popejoy gives the monkey a
        skeptical glance before settling back.

      INT. WHITE HOUSE - ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - NIGHT

        Sayers works tidying up the office.  Her own desk is already 
        immaculate.  Alicia enters, takes a long look and smiles.

                        Oh, John says it's going to be
                        another late night, and to be
                        honest, it's kind of hard to find
                        things around here sometimes.

                          boyfriend's keeping?

                        He's just ambitious.  I admire that
                        about him, actually.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT62.

                                        ALICIA
                        You didn't seem so admiring when he
                        caused that scene in the Green Room.

                                        SAYERS
                        He came to Washington all excited
                        about politics and ended up with a
                        boss who keeps dumping all the
                        worst assignments on him.  Me, I
                        end up in the White House.  It's
                        hard on him.

        Alicia rolls her eyes.

                        Why are you giving me that look?

        Alicia takes a seat next to Sayers, sighs.

                                        ALICIA
                        I'm going to be very blunt, dear.
                        Men lie in this town.

                        Someday he's going to be just like
                          President Kennedy.

                                        ALICIA

                        What is that supposed to mean?

                        Let's just say the President's not
                        as devoted as you think.

        Sayers doesn't want to hear this, returns to her desk.

      INT. MAJESTIC HDQS. - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

        Loengard shakes MIB #1/Popejoy awake.

                                        LOENGARD
                        It's gone!  The monkey.  It's gone!

        With that, MIB #l/Popejoy is wide awake. Both he and
        Loengard stare through the glass window.  What they see is
      an empty cage with the door open.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        I was writing ... I just ...  I
                        didn't hear anything.  What do we
                        do now?

                                        MIB #1/POPEJOY
                        We gotta check this out.
                                  (uneasy)
                        One of us has to go in.

                                        LOENGARD
                        It's my fault.  I'll go.  You make
                        the call.

      INT. BIOLOGY LAB AREA - NIGHT

        Loengard enters, cautiously.  Begins to inspect the
        premises.  Looks for a sign of forced entry on the cage.

        Instead, he finds an open tumbler lock.  At this point,
        Loengard is beginning to get scared and so are we.
        Suddenly:

      THE MONKEY!

        Drops from a perch on the ceiling, grabbing Loengard around
      the throat, riding him around the room attacking him!
        Trying to throw the monkey off his back, Loengard crashes
        first into scientific equipment, then falls over the camera
      and hits the floor hard.

      The monkey scurries back up into the rafters where it begins
        unscrewing an exposed pipe.

        OUTSIDE LAB

        Popejoy hustles down the corridor, stopping when he sees
        spilled liquid pooling outside the lab door.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT64.

        INSIDE LAB

      His gun drawn, Popejoy steps inside the darkened lab.  He
        spots Loengard, who's groggily sitting up now across the
        lab.  Loengard sees something above Popejoy and points.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Look out!

        POPEJOY

        Looks up just in time to see THE MONKEY SWINGING RIGHT AT
        HIM!  Clubbing him in the face with the pipe.  Popejoy drops
      his gun and falls to his knees in pain.

        Incredibly, the monkey grabs the gun ...

        RACK FOCUS from the barrel of the gun to the MONKEY'S
        TERRIFYING FACE.  The skull is exposed in patches where it
      was shaved to perform implantation and attach electrodes
        afterward.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Noooo!

      The monkey shoots Popejoy in cold blood!  Then it turns on
        Loengard, about to shoot him, too, when it hears the
        approaching voice and footfall of more MIB.

      Gun in hand, the monkey rushes into the corridor and out of
        sight.  Seconds later we hear several gunshots.

        Loengard comes limping over to the doorway, looks out in the
        corridor to see:

        Several military guards and MIB #2/Steele, weapons drawn,
        standing over the dead monkey.

        Loengard then tries to comfort the wounded Popejoy, now
        dying before his eyes.  This hits Loengard hard.

      INT. LOENGARD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

      No one is there except Pratt who is on the phone, seated
        behind Loengard's desk.  As he rifles through the contents,
      he speaks the INDECIPHERABLE LANGUAGE we first heard from
        Elliot Grantham.  Suddenly, with a preternatural instinct,
      he stops mid-word and cocks his head to the door.

                                        SAYERS (O.S.)
                        John?

        It's Sayers walking into frame, entering without knocking.
        Pratt quickly hangs up the phone.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT65.

        Sayers stops in her tracks.

                                        SAYERS
                        Oh, excuse me.  I'm looking for
                        John Loengard. He said he has a
                        new office.

                                        PRATT
                        Well, you came to the right place.

        Pratt rises and with his most ingratiating smile, offers his
        hand.

                                        PRATT (CONT'D)
                        Charles Pratt.  I'm just guessing
                        here, but you must be Kimberly.

        Sayers keeps her distance and coolly accepts his hand.

                                        SAYERS
                        John's told me a lot about you,
                          Congressman.

        Pratt notices her distance.

                                        PRATT
                        I take it not all of it was good.

                                        SAYERS
                                  (turns to leave)
                        I'll just be going.

                                        PRATT
                        No, please.  Fire away.  I insist.

                                        SAYERS

                        Your personal life is none of my
                          business, except how you're using
                        John.

                                        PRATT
                        How I'm using him?

        Pratt shakes his head, allows an ironic laugh.

                                        SAYERS
                        I don't think it's anything to
                        laugh about.

                                        PRATT
                        What exactly is it you think I've
                        asked John to do for me?

                                        SAYERS
                        Sounds like you asked him to clean
                        up your dirty laundry back home.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT66.

                                        PRATT
                        Hmmm.  Now the way I heard the
                        story, John's uncle died.  Whose
                        dirty laundry are we smellin' here,
                          Kimberly?

                                        SAYERS
                        I don't have to listen to this.

                                        PRATT
                        'Course not.

                        You can run on back to the White
                        House.

        Pratt fingers the White House identification badge hanging
        around her neck.

                                        PRATT (CONT'D)
                        Must be exciting.  Must keep you
                        busier than a milk cow.

                                        SAYERS
                                  (pulling away)
                        Would you please let go of me?

                                        PRATT
                                  (letting go)
                        Open your eyes, woman.  I think
                        Johnny boy's got both of us snowed.

        Pratt moves closer to Sayers.  She moves for the door.

                                        PRATT (CONT'D)
                        Maybe we should join forces, you
                        and me.  Get to the bottom of this
                        whole affair.

        Pratt's creepiness shakes Sayers up good.  Is this a sexual
        come-on, or something worse?  Sayers takes off, shaken.
        Pratt cracks an insidious smile.

      INT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Loengard sits alone in the apartment.  He's wearing UCLA
        sweats, working simultaneously on a jig-saw puzzle of
        Washington, D.C. and a bottle of hard liquor.  The record
        player is on, but it's at the end of a record, and it's
        skipping on "MACK, THE KNIFE."   As Loengard considers a
        crucial piece: Sayers enters.  She takes one look at
        Loengard, then moves straight for the skipping record,
        scratching the needle off.  Loengard looks up, obviously
        drunk.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Where ya been, Kimmie?

                                        SAYERS
                        Good question.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT67.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Uh-uh.  A good question is, do
                        you go for the color pieces first
                        or do you get all the straight
                        edges?

        Sayers stares at Loengard, truly hurt.

                                        SAYERS
                        You know, John, the thing I loved
                        most about you was how we could
                        always talk.  About anything.  I
                        thought you were my best friend.

        Loengard tries to stand, sensing trouble, but ends up seated
      on the couch again.

                                        SAYERS (CONT'D)
                        Have you been lying to me, John?

                                        LOENGARD
                        What are you talkin' about?

                                        SAYERS
                        I know you're lying!  I went to
                        your office and talked to your
                        weirdo boss!  You weren't working
                        late.  Pratt says you told him your
                        uncle died.  What uncle!?

        Loengard sinks further into his seat.  He knows he's busted.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Look, I didn't want you to worry.

                                        SAYERS
                        Do you have any idea how stupid I
                        feel right now?  They all think
                        you're some kind of playboy at my
                        office.  And honestly, I'm
                          beginning to wonder myself.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Kim, it's not what you think --

                        -- I don't know what to think! I
                        mean, are you punishing me because
                          I wouldn't marry you?  Are you
                        jealous because you want my job?
                        What is it, John?

                                        LOENGARD
                        I want to tell you everything, but
                        it's just so damn ...  complicated.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT68.

                                        SAYERS
                        Well you're going to uncomplicate
                          everything right now ...
                                (she means it)
                        or come tomorrow, I'm moving
                        out.

        Loengard can only lower his eyes.  Sayers is absolutely
        devastated.

                                        SAYERS (CONT'D)
                        So that's your answer?  God ...

        Loengard still can't respond.  Sayers heads into the
        bedroom, SLAMMING THE DOOR behind her.

        Loengard turns, kicking the coffee table over, scattering
      the booze and the puzzle pieces all over the floor.  He eyes
      the room like a caged animal himself, then throws open the
        front door and storms out.

      EXT. REFLECTING POOL - NIGHT

        Loengard stares at his reflection in the water.  He sucks in
      air hard, trying to breathe to free himself.  But he can't.
      The knowledge is terrible.  It changes everything.  He
        cannot escape its searing reality.

        Then a STREAK OF LIGHT across the water catches his eye.  He
        looks up at the black sky above.  Gone.

        Loengard puts his head in his hands and cries at his tragic
          predicament.

      INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Sayers tosses in her sleep.  The LIGHTS in the room suddenly
        PULSE ON, then fade back.  Sayers is awakened by what sounds
        like a HIGH-PITCHED BUZZING, soft but growing in volume.

                                        SAYERS
                        John ..?

      But it's not Loengard.  The sound grows louder, becoming a
        HOLLOW HUM, like the sound of a HORNET'S NEST, only louder.
      The window is mysteriously open.  Shivering and confused,
      she climbs from her bed to close it.  At the window, Sayers'
        face squints in disbelief.

        SAYERS' POV - A SPINNING LIGHT

        A mile above in the dark sky.  Hovering motionless.

        SAYERS

      As she closes the window, she hears a child-like WHISPERING.
      She whirls around, shocked to see:        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT69.

      THE GRAYS

      Now in the room with her.  The STROBING LIGHT offers us only
        teasing flashes of their spindly, hunched forms.  One
        croucnes menacingly atop the dresser.  The other is less
        than a yard from her feet.  Sayers backs up against the
        window, scared speechless until --

      THE WINDOW INEXPLICABLY OPENS!

        Sayers runs toward the door.  The Gray on the dresser
        literally TRANSFORMS BEFORE HER EYES into something vaguely
        reptilian rising from its haunches and baring its teeth in a
        frightening HISS.  Sayers yelps.  The Gray at her feet
        pinches the bulbous end of a organic dropper.  A drop of
        viscous, MILKY FLUID plops to the floor ...

      It SQUIGGLES WITH LIFE across the hardwood ... RAPIDLY
        EXPANDING AND PUDDLING beneath Sayers!

        Almost instantaneously, the milky fluid SPREADS UPWARDS,
        like a tissue absorbing water, covering her body and face in
      an OPAQUE FILM.

        Sayers is paralyzed.  So fast, in fact, that her emergent
        SCREAM is silenced at its first breath.  Only her eyes
        retain mobility.  Wild-eyed and darting.

        Now, as if in SLOW MOTION, an unseen force turns her body
        around to face the window ... where she is bathed in
        BRILLIANT LIGHT.  As she disappears into the light, we:

      INT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - DAY

      The Morning After.  Loengard has spent the night on the
        couch in his clothes.  He wakes up shivering.

      INT. BEDROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

        Loengard enters, finds Sayers still asleep. The window is
        still open from last night.  He gently shakes her awake.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Kim.  Kim, you're gonna be late for
                        work.

        Sayers seems half-asleep even as she answers.

                        What?  What time is it?

                                        LOENGARD
                          Seven-thirty.

                        I'm so tired.  I need to sleep.

        Sayers rolls back in bed.  Loengard goes to shut the window.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Babe, I'm really sorry about last
                        night.  I ... I ...

        Loengard sits at the side of the bed, strokes Sayers' hair.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        I just want you to know.  I'm into
                          something I'm going to try to get
                        out of, but you gotta believe me.
                        You're the only one.

                                        SAYERS
                        Alright ...

                                        LOENGARD
                        I'm serious.  If I lose you, I lose
                          everything.

                                        SAYERS
                        That won't happen, John.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT71.

        Sayers sits up, blinks a few times.

                                        SAYERS (CONT'D)
                        I had this strange dream.  Your
                        boss, Pratt, was in it.
                                  (stretches)
                        I'm so tired

        Loengard leans down and gives Sayers a tender kiss on the
        cheek

                                        LOENGARD
                        I'll call your office, tell them
                        you'll be late.  Feel better.

        Loengard takes a last look, then exits.  STAY WITH SAYERS a
        moment.  Suddenly, she sits bolt upright.  There's blood on
      her pillow.  She wipes away a small trickle from her nose.

      INT. UNION STATION - DAY

      The early morning crowd on the way to work.  A SUPER reads:

                          Union Station, Washington D.C.
                                   October 18, 1962

        PICK UP Loengard as he moves through the crowds.  There is a 
          seriousness, a sullenness, a slight squint to those
        previously wide eyes.  During this, we hear:

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        I came to Washington to stand in
                        the light, fighting for things I
                        believed in.

        Loengard navigates down the flight of steps, cuts around the
        stairwell to the "Employees Only" door

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        Instead, I found myself completely
                        alone, leading a double life,
                        standing in the shadows of a
                        terrible secret.

        Loengard opens the door and goes inside with a precision and
        nonchalance that can only come from practice.

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        What surprised me most was how very
                        good I was at living the lie.

      INT. MAJESTIC HDQS. - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

        A "Star Chamber" gathering of the dozen "directors" of
        MJ-12.  Bach, Loengard and Hertzog stand near a film
        projector which provides the only light in the room as it
        shows:        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT72.

        THE MONKEY FILM

        Featuring the test chimpanzee ripping the contact patches
        from it's head, picking its own lock and letting itself
      out of the cage.

                                        HERTZOG
                        After repeated viewing of the
                        'Monkey Film', we now believe the
                          so-called 'Grays' may be nothing
                        more than a host organism for a
                        superior intelligence, what we are
                        now calling the 'ganglion.'

      The last bit of film shows the bloody aftermath of the
        carnage between the monkey and the MIB.  The lights come up
        again in the room.

      INT. MAJESTIC HDQS. - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

        Loengard sits across a table from a SUBJECT, a middle - aged
        woman, attractive.  His demeanor is completely calm and
        reasonable, if not a little cold.

                                        LOENGARD
                        So who's your favorite movie star,

                        Used to be Marilyn Monroe.

                        What happened?  Lost interest?

                        Monroe's dead.  That's why she's
                        not my favorite movie star anymore.

                                        LOENGARD

                        No.  I knew she was dead.  I guess
                        I forgot to mention it.

        INTERCUT: CONFERENCE ROOM / INTERROGATION ROOM FILM

        Over this, Bach addresses the "directors", hidden in shadow.

                                        BACH
                        Doctor Hertzog and Agent Loengard
                        have started developing a profile
                        on these Extra-terrestrial
                          Biological Entities.  That's in
                        your briefing books, gentlemen,

                                (a little nervous)
                        We call it the EBE Profile for
                        short.  It's basically everything
                        we know about the aliens to date.
                        One of our latest theories, which
                        we've been testing, is that there
                        may be a pattern to the emotional
                        and intellectual scrambling which
                        seems to take place in recently
                          implanted humans, like this woman
                        here.

      Our attention returns to the film:

                                        LOENGARD
                        So Hilary, do you and your husband
                        go dancing very often?

      The woman stands indignantly, practically shouting at
        Loengard.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT 74.

                        what you mean.

                        Sports?  So when would you guess
                        was the last time you had a spider
                        mite burrow into you during a golf
                        match?

      The subject thinks about this, maybe a beat too long.

                        He plays golf.  I don't.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Okay.  At home then.

                                        SUBJECT
                                (wry laughter)
                        Oh, you know.  From time to time, I

                        What we still don't know is how the

                        waiting for answers.

      Now WE SEE the conference table seats the following people:
        Governor Rockefeller (MJ-1 from the teaser, now MJ-2),
        GENERAL ARTHUR BROWN (MJ-3), COMMANDER JACK VAN DRUTEN

                        We performed a 'Cerebral Eviction'

        Loengard appears shocked to hear this news.  Bach nods at

                        of the patient's brain matter.

        Loengard, shaken to his core, whispers to Bach:

      As the room dissolves into AD LIBBED argument, an MIB
        enters, hands Bach an envelope.  Bach unseals it, reads the

                        Doctor, you said you were working
                        on another way!  Something about
                          injecting the ganglion with a

                        emotions aside.  These decisions
                        are not ours to make.

        nearby sound of JOHN KENNEDY'S VOICE, amplified over some
        kind of loudspeaker.  Sayers moves numbly in that direction.

        AROUND THE CORNER

        A crowd of onlookers stand in front of the ground floor
        television appliance store.  They are watching President
        Kennedy on TV.

                                        KENNEDY (T.V.)
                        ... aggressive conduct if allowed
                        to go unchallenged, ultimately
                        leads to war.  The greatest danger
                        is to do nothing ...

        Sayers watches, seemingly uncomprehending what she's seeing.
      The rest of the crowd seems to get it all too well.  The
        world is on the verge of nuclear armageddon.

      THE CHEVY

        Parks at the curb.  Loengard exits, moves toward the
        apartment only to stop in front of the window himself.  He
        sees Sayers, eyes puffy from crying.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Kim, what's going on?

                                        SAYERS
                        I don't know.  Doesn't make any
                        sense ...

        Before Loengard can really understand, the MAN next to him
        interjects:

                                        MAN
                        Looks like we're goin' to war.
                        Russians got missiles in Cuba.

                                        LOENGARD
                        My God ...

                                        SAYERS
                        What's happening, John?

                                        LOENGARD
                        I don't know, but I'm going to find
                        out.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT78.

        EXT. BACH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        Bethesda, Maryland.  Normally, a typical suburban
        neighborhood.  Tonight, however, there are neighbors packing
        cars, shouting about bomb shelters, listening to the RADIO
        NEWS.  Loengard exits his Chevy, approaches the door to one
        house and knocks.  Bach answers.  He is not happy.  From
        inside, WE HEAR:

                                        MRS. BACH (O.S.)
                        Honey, who is it?

                                        BACH
                                  (yelling back inside)
                        I've got it.

        Bach moves onto the porch, closing the door behind him,
        lighting a cigarette.

                                        BACH (CONT'D)
                        There is no reason good enough to
                        explain your being here.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Well, since the world seems to be
                        going up in smoke, I thought we
                        could bend the rules a little.

                                        BACH
                                  (impatient)
                        What do you want, John?

                                        LOENGARD
                        I know it's always changing with
                        you, but what I want is the truth
                        about this Cuba thing.

                                        BACH
                        I'm under no obligation to discuss
                        this with you.

                                        LOENGARD
                        That's what I'm talking about.  Who
                        exactly are you obligated to
                        discuss this with?  Because while
                        I'm watching the TV -- maybe I'm
                        naive -- but I'm asking myself
                        whether Kennedy has told Khrushchev
                        about 'Patient Zero?'  Because if
                        he did, I don't see how they could
                        threaten each other like this.

                        Go home.  Be with Kimberly.  She's
                        probably scared.

                                        LOENGARD
                        We're all scared.  You're the only
                        one who's not.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT79.

                                        BACH
                        They'll work it out.  They have to.

                                        LOENGARD
                          President Kennedy doesn't know
                        about 'Majestic,' does he?

        Bach stares at Loengard, shakes his head.

                                        BACH
                        I took a chance bringing you
                        inside, John.

                                        LOENGARD
                        So I should be eternally grateful?
                        Forget it.  Not if I'm being lied
                        to.  It's a simple question, Frank.
                        Does he know?  Yes or no?

        Bach takes a long drag on his cigarette, then, as he
        exhales:

                                        BACH
                        The President knows exactly what he
                        needs to know.

        Loengard reels against the car, stunned by the confirmation
      of his suspicion.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I knew it.  I knew it.
                                  (beat)
                        Just tell me this: who appointed
                        you God?

                                        BACH
                        Ike.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Ike?!

                                        BACH
                        He never trusted Kennedy. After
                        Nixon lost, Ike gave us the
                          authority to decide which future
                          presidents get told.  It's all
                          perfectly legal.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Who cares?!  Kennedy could tell the
                        people.  He's a great leader.

                                        BACH
                        That will not happen on my watch.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Frank, you can't keep the President
                        of the United States in the dark
                        about this.  That's wrong.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT80.

                                        BACH
                        Look at the panic this Cuba thing's
                        caused.  You take God and
                          Government out of the eguation, all
                        you have left is chaos.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You know, Frank, if you're going to
                        fight for Humanity, then at least
                        have a little faith in us.

      And with that, Loengard turns on his heel, leaving Bach
        standing alone.

      INT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Sayers stands alone, looking out the window.  Outside, there
      is a feeling of low-grade fear and panic on the streets,
        muted through the glass window.

      WE HEAR a very soft BUZZING OF INSECTS.  Without hearing a
        knock, Sayers goes to the door and opens it.  It's Pratt --
        without his down-home manner.

                                        PRATT
                        Hello, Kimberly.  Are you alone?

        Sayers nods.  Pratt lets himself in.  Closes the door.

                        I told you I don't want your help.

                        Since John Loengard was not here on
                        the night of our visit, you must
                        now watch him until we return.

                        then ...

        Pratt goes to the window, opens it.  He holds his hand out.
        A moment, then a small GLOBE OF LIGHT descends from the sky.

      The light globe, about the size of a bowling ball, settles
      on Pratt's open palm.  As it does, the sound of BUZZING
        increases in the room.

                                        PRATT (CONT'D)
                        Touch it!  All your guestions will
                        be answered!  Touch it!

        Sayers begins to reach her hand out to the light globe, but
        pulls away.

                                        SAYERS
                        I won't!  You can't make me!

        Pratt steps ominously closer.  Sayers finds herself back
        against the wall.

                                        PRATT
                        It's natural to fight at first.
                        Many of them do.  By now, though,
                        you know where this must end.

      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Loengard's Chevy pulls up and parks.  He exits.  WE SEE
        people on the street, highly anxious, packing cars with
        their possessions, discussing their plans with neighbors.
        Loengard enters the apartment building.

      INT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Pratt has his hand extended toward Sayers, holding out the
        light globe.  He utters the FOUR-WORD PHRASE in the
        INDECIPHERABLE LANGUAGE.

        Seemingly understanding the phrase, Sayers reaches out once
        again.  Then, in an obvious supreme act of her humanity
        struggling to assert itself, she pulls away.

                                        SAYERS
                        No!!!

        Sayers stumbles sideways against the wall, pulling the
        window curtain down upon her.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT82.

        Pratt looks to the door, precognitively responding to the
        arrival of Loengard.  As the door opens, the light globe
        bursts into a THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT and disperses itself
        into thin air. Loengard enters.  Pratt forces a smile.

                                        PRATT
                        Why, hello, John.

                                        LOENGARD
                        What are you doing here?

                                        PRATT
                        I came by to check on you.  With
                        this Cuba business ...

        Loengard sees Sayers, rushes to her.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Kim, are you okay?

        Sayers is shivering and sobbing.  Shakes her head.

                                        SAYERS
                        John, he's in my head ... or
                          something is ...

        Pratt begins to move quickly to the door.  Loengard leaps
      up, races to stop him.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Not so fast.

                                        PRATT
                        It's too late, John.  We have her.

        Loengard searches Pratt's unblinking eyes.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You're one of them!  Aren't you?!

        Loengard ferociously spins Pratt around and throws him
        against the wall.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        Why her?!  Why not me?!

                                        PRATT
                        Be patient, John.  Your time will
                        come soon.

        Loengard tackles Pratt into the coffee table, breaking it in
        two.  Both men come up swinging.  Loengard closes, grabs
        Pratt by the collar and whips him toward the window.  He
        crashes through onto:        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT83.

        EXT. STREET OUTSIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Where, in a shower of glass, Pratt falls to the cement
        below.  Blood begins to come from his ears and nose.
        Someone SCREAMS.  As he dies, his body convulses in a death
        shudder, punctuated by HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.

        While a small group of onlookers gather, a teenager steps up
        next to Pratt's body.  He surveys the corpse with no sign of
        emotion.  Then he alone looks up at the window.

      INT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Loengard has returned to a trembling Sayers.  As he cradles
      her in his arms:

                          Something's happening to me, John.
                        I can't think straight.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I know, baby.  Something's inside
                        you that affects your brain.

                                        SAYERS
                                  (losing it)
                          Something's inside me?!

        Approaching SIRENS echo outside.  Loengard hurries to the
        broken-out window.  Peeks down at the crowd.

                                        LOENGARD
                        We have to go.  I'll explain it all
                        later.

        Sayers jumps up, grabs Loengard hard.

                                        SAYERS
                        Just get it out of me, John!  It's
                        killing me!

                                        LOENGARD
                        Okay, baby, okay.  Let's go.

        Loengard rushes them out the back door, as we:


                                                                                  FADE OUT.

        FADE IN:

      EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

        Loengard's Chevy screeches up in front of a row of
        brownstone apartments.  He jumps out, leaving the car
        illegally parked, and rushes up to a door.  Loengard starts
        hammering on it with his fist.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Doctor Hertzog!  It's me!
                          Loengard!

        Loengard begins to pull at the door, trying to force it
        open.  A beat, then Hertzog appears in a bathrobe, fumbling
        with his eyeglasses.

                                        HERTZOG
                        John!  What is it?

                                        LOENGARD
                        The aliens.  Somehow they got to my
                          girlfriend.  She's in the car.  We
                        have to take her to 'Majestic.' You
                        have to do your A.R.T. on her.

                                        HERTZOG
                        John, that's impossible.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Let's go, Doctor.  Now!

                                        HERTZOG
                        No.  You've seen the protocol. The
                          directive prioritizes the
                          collection of 'live' specimens. If
                        we take her in, I will be forced to
                        perform a cerebral eviction instead.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Cut it out?  If you do that, she'll
                        die.

                                        HERTZOG
                        I will have no choice.

        Loengard stumbles back, the cruel reality sinking in.  Then,
      in desperation:

                                        LOENGARD
                        Can you help me do an A.R.T. out
                        here?

                                        HERTZOG
                        John, please.  Don't put me in this
                          position.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT85.

        Loengard picks Hertzog up by the robe and gets in his face.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Then you tell me what I need to do.
                        And you make it quick.

      INT. THE CHEVY - NIGHT

        Sayers looks in the mirror, examining her eyes, opening her
        mouth, staring to see if she can glimpse this thing that has
        invaded her.  Startled by Loengard as he climbs into the
        driver's seat.  He starts stuffing Alka-Seltzer tablets into
        a milk bottle, then shakes it vigorously.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Here.  Drink it.

                                        SAYERS
                          I thought we were going to ...
                        that place where you work.

                                        LOENGARD
                        We can't, Kim.  We have to do this
                        on our own.

        Sayers stares at the frothing milk bottle.

                                        SAYERS
                        How does this work?

                                        LOENGARD
                        Hertzog says it raises the PH-
                        factor in your body, which makes it
                        a bad place to be for something
                        that doesn't belong there.

                                        SAYERS
                                  (straining to make sense)
                        Part of me knows I have to ... do
                        this.  But part of me ... doesn't.

                                        LOENGARD
                        The part of you that does has to
                        win.  It has to, Kim.

        Struggling with both hands to raise the carton to her lips,
        Sayers battles the hidden force inside her keeping the drink
      at bay.  It takes a visible effort, but when the carton
        finally reaches her lips she takes several big gulps.  Then
        grimaces in disgust.

                                        SAYERS
                        Now what?

      EXT. VACANT HOUSE - NIGHT

        A "For Sale" sign is posted outside.  The Chevy pulls to the
        curb.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT86.

      INT. VACANT HOUSE - NIGHT

      We see a syringe extract fluid from a bottle of nail polish
        remover.  When Loengard turns around, he wields the loaded
        syringe.  Sayers gasps.

                                        SAYERS
                        What are you doing?

      She jumps to her feet in alarm.  Loengard forcefully guides
      her back onto the chair.

                                        LOENGARD
                        The main ingredient is acetone.
                        I have to inject the organism with
                          something that'll attack it.  Then,
                        with your PH off balance, it'll
                        want to leave your body.

      He pushes away the hair from her neck, syringe in hand.

                                        SAYERS
                        What happened to the other people
                        he did this to?  And no more lies.

                                        LOENGARD
                                  (beat)
                        It's never been tried on a person.

                                        SAYERS
                        So unless I want to live with
                        it ...

                                        LOENGARD
                        You can't live with it, Kim.

        Sayers suddenly sits bolt upright and knocks him backward to
      the floor.  She races toward the door, but it's locked.
      She (or it) is wild with panic.  Loengard has to literally
        tackle her and pin her to the floor.  Sitting on her back,
      he pulls the hair back from the nape of her neck and injects
      the needle's contents.

      EXT. ANOTHER PART OF TOWN - NIGHT

      An OLD MAN reading the evening paper cocks his head,
        reacting to something strange.  We are in his POV now.
      We hear a PULSING SOUND.  He hurries from the house, leaving
      his baffled wife standing on the front stoop.

      BACK AT THE VACANT HOUSE

        Loengard watches Sayers' unconscious body, stroking her
        forehead gently.  He has restrained her with several
        extension cords.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT87.

        Suddenly, her body stiffens, scaring Loengard, and she goes
        through a convulsive shaking spell.  She begins to mutter
      the INDECIPHERABLE FOUR-WORD PHRASE.  After a beat, Loengard
        slaps her face.  Sayers' eyes flutter open.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Kim, it's me.  You're going to be
                        okay.

                                        SAYERS
                        John, you have to let me go.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Not yet.

                                        SAYERS
                        I'm okay.  Really.  It worked.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Not yet, Kim.  I am so sorry.  I
                        just can't --

                                        SAYERS
                                  (suddenly furious)
                        JOHN, I HATE YOU!  LET ME GO!

                                        LOENGARD
                        That's not you talking, Kim.  You
                        have to keep fighting it.

        Abruptly, Sayers' fury turns to a whimpering, tearful plea.

                                        SAYERS
                        Honey, please.  I want to go home.
                        Please just take me home.
                        Please  ... please ...

        Loengard has to cover his ears.  The guilt is overwhelming.
      But Sayers persists.  Really bawling now.  Forcing Loengard
      to grit his teeth and turn away to see:

        A FACE

        Appears in the sliding glass door.  It's the Old Man, armed
        with a shovel.

        LOENGARD

        Freaks out.  He gestures to the Old Man.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Listen.  It's not what it looks
                        like.  I can explain this --

      The Old Man unexpectedly takes the shovel and swings it into
      the glass door, shattering it, sending shards everywhere!        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT88.

      The Old Man comes after Loengard with the shovel.  Loengard
      has to dodge wild swings.  During this, Loengard is further
        alarmed to see THE TEENAGER (seen earlier at Pratt's body)
        entering, carrying a golf club.

        While Loengard keeps the Old Man at bay, the Teenager
        catches Loengard in the head with a roundhouse swing and
        knocks him out cold.  Before the Old Man can deliver the
        death blow with his shovel:

        Sayers emits a PRIMAL SCREAM.  She stiffens again and begins
        violently gagging.  Her face constricts and her eyes roll
        back in her head.

        Then, with a scary suddenness, she coughs up:

        A GANGLION

        Twitching and incipient, clearly not as developed as the one
        taken from Grantham earlier.

      THE ATTACKERS

        Stop what they are doing and move to gently cradle the alien
        organism.

        LOENGARD

        Struggles for consciousness.  He sees what is going on and
        crawls toward the shovel.  With all his strength, he grabs
      it and rises and begins his own attack.

        A few strong hits and both the Old Man and the Teenager have
        been knocked out.

      THE GANGLION

        Falls to the floor and skitters into the shadows.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Loengard stalks about, looking for it.  When he tracks the
        creature down, he smashes it with his shovel.

      EXT. VACANT HOUSE - NIGHT

        Carrying an unconscious Sayers in his arms, Loengard returns
      to his Chevy, where he gently lays his girlfriend into the
        backseat.  As he hurries around to the driver's door:

        HEADLIGHTS

        Shine on Loengard.  There is blood running down his head.
        From a car parked directly in front of the Chevy (on the
        wrong side of the street), four silhouetted figures emerge
        from the bright light.  We recognize them as Bach, MIB
        #2/Steele, MIB #3 and Hertzog.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT89.

                                        LOENGARD
                                (to Hertzog; angry)
                        So you couldn't help me, but you
                        went running to them?

                                        HERTZOG
                        Please, John.  It's my job. I know
                        how you feel but --

                                        LOENGARD
                                (to Bach)
                        -- And if you're going to follow
                        me, you could at least lend a hand.

                                        BACH
                        We just got here, John.  We had to
                        clean up the mess you left at your
                          apartment.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I'll bet you knew about Pratt,
                        didn't you?

                                        BACH
                        We suspected.

                                        LOENGARD
                        But I didn't need to know, is that
                        it?

                                        BACH
                        You proved our case.  That's all
                        hat matters.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You go to hell, Frank.

        Loengard turns back toward his car.

                                        BACH
                        We need Kimberly now, John.  Don't
                        let her death be in vain.

        Loengard gets a little laugh out of this.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You guys are like vultures.  The
                        only problem is, she's not dead!

      INT. MAJESTIC HDQS. - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

        Sayers rests on a bed.  She's hooked up to several
        biological monitors.  Loengard sits by her side, holding her
        hand, looking like he hasn't slept in days.

      WE PULL BACK behind the glass window, where Bach and Hertzog
      are watching the young couple.  Hertzog departs.  Bach taps
      on the window and motions for Loengard to join him.  As
        Loengard comes around:        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT90.

                                        BACH
                        She checks out.  Looks like she's
                        going to be okay.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Then I'm taking her home now.

                                        BACH
                        Keep an eye on her.  If she starts
                          remembering any details, or if
                          complications should arise, we'll
                        need to see her right away.

        Loengard nods, lets his gaze drift back to Sayers.  Then:

                                        LOENGARD
                        I want out, Frank.  I thought I
                        could handle this, but I can't.

                                        BACH
                        You know I can't agree to that.

                                        LOENGARD
                        What am I supposed to do?  What am
                          I supposed to tell her?

                                        BACH
                        That's your business.  My business
                        is keeping you part of the team.
                        We need you, John.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I'm twenty-five years old.  I'm
                        nobody.  You don't need me.

                                        BACH
                        You know too much.
                                  (beat)
                        You can take a break.  Get your
                        life back in order.  But remember,
                        you always work for us, John.  That
                        never changes.

      NEWS FILM - THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON (STOCK)

        Nearly a quarter of a million civil rights marchers gather
      to hear speeches and entertainers at the largest protest of
      its kind ever.  A SUPER reads:

                 The Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C.
                                    August 28, 1963

        MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. speaks to the enthusiastic crowd.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT91.

                                        KING (T.V.)
                        I still have a dream that one day
                        this nation will rise up and live
                        out the true meaning of its creed:
                        'We hold these truths to be
                          self-evident, that all men are
                        created equal.'

        Over scenes of the marchers from news coverage, WE HEAR:

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        After the Cuban Missile Crisis, a
                        tide of change was sweeping
                        America.  For most people, hope was
                        rising.

      EXT. REFLECTING POOL - DAY

        Loengard, dressed in a black suit and shades, stands next to
        Sayers at the back of the March on Washington crowd.  Sayers
        takes pictures with her Brownie Hawkeye.

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        For Kimberly and me, it was just
                        the opposite.  Bach gave us a month
                        in Miami, all expenses paid.  But
                        while we were gone, he also bugged
                        the apartment.  The only time we
                        were alone was in the middle of a
                        crowd.

      The crowd ROARS with approval as King orates. Loengard  has
      to shout to be heard.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Listen to that.  What if all these
                        people knew who the real enemy
                        was?  That would definitely be a
                        force to be reckoned with.

                                        SAYERS
                        Martin Luther King is not going
                        to start talking about you-know-
                        what.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Not King.  Kennedy.  He's the only
                        one who could tell the world what's
                        really happening and get them to
                        fight instead of panic.  See, Bach
                        doesn't get it.  He wants the same
                        thing they do -- keep it a
                        secret.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT92.

                                        SAYERS
                        John, you don't just tell the
                          President of the United States
                        there are aliens here on Earth.
                        Even if you could, you'd look like
                        a fool.

                                        SIMONSON (O.S.)
                        Hey, Loengard.

        From the crowd, Loengard and Sayers see Simonson
          approaching.

                                        LOENGARD
                          Simonson!  Kim, you remember Mark
                        Simonson from Congressman Pratt's
                        office.

        Sayers and Simonson AD-LIB greetings.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Shame about Pratt, isn't it?

                                        SAYERS
                        To be honest, I never liked him.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Me neither.  I just mean, getting
                        mugged right on the streets.
                          Washington sure isn't as safe as it
                        used to be.

                                        LOENGARD
                        So what are you up to now?

                                        SIMONSON
                        I'm moving the family down to
                        Alabama.  I signed up with Doctor
                        King to help out with voter
                          registration.
                                (off Loengard's look)
                        Hey, it's better than starting over
                        again with some other lunatic
                          Congressman.

                                        LOENGARD
                        No, it sounds great. Wish I could
                        join you.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Listen, Loengard, can I ask you
                          something?  In private?

        Loengard looks to Sayers, who takes her cue and returns to
        photographing the rally.

                                        SIMONSON (CONT'D)
                        I've thought about it.  I do want
                        to know what you found out.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT93.

                                        LOENGARD
                        No, you don't.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Come on.  You at least owe me that.

        Loengard stares at him, looks around, leans close.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Look, I can tell you this.  Flying
                        saucers are not man-made.

        A long beat while Simonson holds Loengard's dead-eye
        stare ... then busts up laughing.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Damn, Loengard, you really had me
                        going there for a second.
                                  (beat)
                        You two ever get down South, give a
                        visit.

        Loengard shakes Simonson's hand, then watches him disappear
        back into the crowd.  Loengard returns to Sayers' side.

                                        SAYERS
                        Did you tell him?

                                        LOENGARD
                        Yeah.  But he thought it was all a
                        big joke.

                                        SAYERS
                        That's what I'm trying to tell you.
                        Think how crazy it sounds, John.
                        You have to have proof.  Which
                        you're never going to get out of
                          Majestic.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You're right.  But everybody has a
                          weakness.  Even Bach.

        Sayers looks at Loengard, wondering what he has planned.

        EXT. BACH'S HOUSE - DAY

      The Chevy is parked discretely down the street.

        INT. THE CHEVY - DAY

        Loengard looks out the window as he mixes Sanka into hot
        water from a thermos bottle.  He sees the door open at the
        house.  Loengard shakes Sayers awake.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Kim, Kim.  There
 they are.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT94.

        Loengard indicates the front porch.  Bach and his wife (MRS.
        BACH) hug and kiss their two grade schoolers goodbye, then
        send them on their way carrying lunch buckets.

                                        SAYERS
                        I can't believe that man has
                          children.

                                        LOENGARD
                        All right, when I wave at you, go.

        Loengard gets out of the car, heads across the street.

      EXT. BACH'S HOUSE - DAY

        Loengard has climbed up a tree along the side of the house.
        He's got a vantage point on an upstairs window.  A beat,
        then he waves at Sayers in the car.

      INT. THE CHEVY - DAY

        Sayers slides on a pair of big sunglasses and ties a
        colorful scarf around her head.  Looking at herself in the
        mirror, she takes a deep, nervous breath.

        INTERCUT:  LOENGARD UPSTAIRS / SAYERS DOWNSTAIRS

        Loengard struggles to slide the window open, then lets
        himself in.

        Sayers approaches the front door.  With a trembling hand she
        rings the doorbell.

        Loengard is in the hallway.

        Mrs. Bach yells upstairs.

                                        MRS. BACH
                        I'll get it.

        Bach is in the bathroom, towel around his waist.  He takes
      his chain and container off his neck and places it on the
        counter.

        Mrs. Bach answers the door.  Sayers looks and acts
        remarkably convincing.

                                        SAYERS
                        Hi.  I'm terribly sorry to bother
                        you this early in the morning, but
                        my name is Charrise Rich and I'm a
                          substitute teacher at Willow
                          Elementary.

                                        MRS. BACH
                        Yes?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT95.

                                        SAYERS
                        I've got the directions but I must
                        have taken the wrong turn.  I saw
                        your kids so I figured you must
                        know where the school is ...

        Upstairs, Loengard moves down the hallway.  He accidentally
        bumps into a kids toy, sending it skittering across the
        floor. He sneaks a peek down at Mrs. Bach, who looks
        upstairs,  shrugs it off, then returns to chatting with
        Sayers.

        Loengard stands outside the bathroom.  He hears the shower
        running.  He comes around.  BACH ISN'T IN THE SHOWER YET
        Loengard bolts back behind the door, holds his breath.  Did
      he see him?

        A beat, Loengard sneaks another look.  Bach is in the
        shower.  There it is.  The container.  The shower is opaque
      but you can see images through it.  Loengard duck walks into
      the bathroom, reaches up to the counter and grabs the
        container.  He fumbles to open it, manages to, removes the
        material.  He slides the container lid back on, gets out.

        Downstairs, Sayers sees Loengard exiting through the window
        into the tree.

                                        SAYERS
                        Are all the neighbors as friendly
                        as you?

                                        MRS. BACH
                        You're sweet.  We get along ...
                        except for Mrs. Crutchfield at the
                        end of the block --

        Sayers sees Loengard get into the car, checks her watch.

                                        SAYERS
                          Goodness, look at the time.  If I
                        don't get a move on, they'll need a
                          substitute for me.
                                  (over her shoulder)
                        Nice meeting you.

        Mrs. Bach waves and closes the door.  Totally oblivious.

      EXT. PARK BENCH/JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - DAY

        Sayers sits on a bench, picking at a sack lunch.  After a
        moment, Loengard appears carrying an envelope.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Okay.  It's got the signed
                          affidavit.  The material is in the
                        specimen bag.  Everything's here.

                                        SAYERS
                        I guess it's up to me now, huh?        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT96.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You know, you don't have to do
                        this.

                                        SAYERS
                        Of course I do.  We both know it.

        Sayers takes the envelope, kisses Loengard.

                                        SAYERS (CONT'D)
                        Wish me luck.

        Loengard takes a look at Sayers, standing before him.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Hey ... you know what I love best
                        about you?
                                  (beat)
                          Everything.

        Sayers flashes him a quick smile, then musters her
        determination and heads for the White House.

        INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - EXECUTIVE RECEPTION - DAY

        Sayers nervously approaches executive secretary EVELYN
        LINCOLN.  Clutching the all-important envelope, she takes a
        deep breath.

                                        SAYERS
                        Hi.  Mrs. Lincoln?

                                        MRS. LINCOLN
                        Good morning.

                                        SAYERS
                        I'm Kimberly Sayers.  I work for
                        Alicia Burnside.

                                        MRS. LINCOLN
                        Yes.  I've seen your name on the
                        staff list.
                                  (winks)
                        In fact, I think it was your
                          boyfriend I saw on the First Lady's
                        TV tour last year.

                                        SAYERS
                        Oh ...

                                        MRS. LINCOLN
                        Don't fret, dear.  You've still got
                        your job.  Now what can I do for
                        you?

                                        SAYERS
                        Well, the First Lady wanted the
                          President to review the Hyannis
                        Port re-decoration plan.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT 97.

                                        MRS. LINCOLN
                                  (reaching out)
                        Here.  I can just attach it to his
                        daily briefing.

                                        SAYERS
                                  (holding on)
                        She told me to make sure that only
                        the President sees this.

        A beat.  It's all in the balance.  Mrs. Lincoln smiles
        again.

                                        MRS. LINCOLN
                        If I've learned one thing in all my
                        years, it's to let the wives call
                        their own shots.  I'll see to it
                        that he gets it alone.

        Sayers relinquishes the package.

                                        SAYERS
                        Oh, thank you.  I'm sure that'll
                        really be appreciated.

        Lincoln stands and heads inside the Oval Office.

                                        MRS. LINCOLN
                        Mister President ...

        From the back, WE SEE Lincoln approaching a familiar head of
        hair, sitting in a rocking chair, and we:


                                                                                  FADE OUT.

        FADE IN:

      EXT. HICKORY HILL MANSION - DAY

        A black limousine pulls into the circular driveway.

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        Finally the news came down that the
                          President's brother, Attorney
                        General Robert Kennedy, wanted to
                        meet me.  As I was being driven to
                        his house, I realized that he and I
                        now had something in common.  We
                        knew a secret that would bond our
                        lives together as long as we both
                        lived.

        Loengard exits, escorted by a Secret Service agent.  An AIDE
        approaches, asks the agent:

                                        AIDE
                        Were you followed?

      The agent shakes his head.  The aide turns to Loengard.

                                        AIDE (CONT'D)
                        Thanks for coming.  This way.

      The aide takes off and Loengard follows.

      EXT. HICKORY HILL MANSION - PORTICO - DAY

        Loengard, nervous but determined, is escorted by the aide.

                                        AIDE
                        Wait here.  I'll get him.

      The aide disappears inside.  Loengard looks around at his
        surroundings, sees a weathered football.  He tosses it in
      his hands until he is startled by:

                                        RFK
                        Mister Loengard.

        It's the aide with BOBBY (RFK) KENNEDY.  As the aide fades
        back, Loengard puts the football back where he found it.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Sir.  It's an honor.

                                        RFK
                        The honor's mine.  If what I'm
                          beginning to understand is true,
                        you've put a lot on the line to get
                        here.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT 99.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Well, sir, there's a lot at stake.

                                        RFK
                        Let's take a walk.

      RFK begins to lead Loengard away, futher guaranteeing their
        privacy.

        ANOTHER ANGLE

        Down by the river front.

                                        RFK
                        We had the sample analyzed.  It's
                        as advertised.  We've checked out
                        certain elements of your story --
                          discretely, of course -- and it
                        seems to hold together.  I must
                        tell you, it has made it rather
                        hard to concentrate on such mundane
                        matters as trade enforcement
                        budgets.

                                        LOENGARD
                        What is the President going to do?

                                        RFK
                        John, the President has less than a
                        year in his term. He's got to get
                          re-elected if he's going to do
                          anything.  The second term.  That's
                        when we get this out.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I can't stay in Majestic, can I?

                                        RFK
                        You have to.  The President feels
                        he needs someone like you on the
                        inside.  You'll be contacted from
                        time to time until then.  Will you
                        do that for us?

        MYSTERY POV - LOENGARD & RFK

        Still talking.  Seen from across the river as Loengard nods
      his agreement.

        INT. MAJESTIC HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

        Bach watches a silent film of the meeting between Loengard
      and RFK.  MIB #2/Steele watches with him, obviously showing
      off his work.  On the screen, WE SEE RFK extend his hand to
        Loengard.  With a paternal pat on the shoulder, RFK sends
        Loengard away.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT100.

                                 MIB #2/STEELE
                        We couldn't get sound from that
                          distance, but you get the idea.

                                        BACH
                                  (thinking to himself)
                        You don't get to the Attorney
                        General unless he wants you to ...
                        Unless he's already seen something
                          incriminating ...

        Bach lets his mind wander, considering the possibilities.
        Slowly, his eyes go to his chest and the tiny container
        hanging from the chain around his neck.  He slowly slides
      the lid.

        THERE'S NOTHING THERE!

        Bach rips the chain and throws it and the container straight
      at the screen.  We've never seen him so emotional.  Even
        Steele is surprised.

      INT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - OUTSIDE HALLWAY - NIGHT

        Loengard and Sayers together.  Loengard fiddles with the
        key.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You know what, Kim, I haven't been
                        this optimistic since we moved in.
                        You remember that?  It seems so
                        long ago ...

                                        SAYERS
                          I remember you asked me to marry
                        you.

      The promising mood is shattered when he throws the door
        open.

      INT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

      The entire apartment has been trashed in a thorough search.
      The two of them stand dumbfounded for a moment.

                                        SAYERS
                        John, what does this mean?

        Sayers walks gingerly into the wreckage.  Loengard moves to
      the window.  He sees:

        LOENGARD'S POV - THE STREET

        Where a dark sedan is parked, near Loengard's Chevy.  Two
      MIB inside (including MIB #3), check their revolvers,
        holster them under their jackets and start for the
        apartment.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT101.

        BACK INSIDE THE APARTMENT

        Loengard turns back from the window.

                                        LOENGARD
                        They're coming up here.

      INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT

      The two MIB check the door, see that it's locked.  A nod
        between them, then one of them kicks into the door, breaking
      it open.

      INT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

      The two MIB rush in.  They find Sayers crouched in the
        wreckage, holding on to something.  It's:

        A FRAMED PHOTO

      The one showing Sayers and Loengard standing in front of the
        Capitol Building, smiling, from far more innocent days.  The
        glass frame is cracked.

                                        SAYERS
                                  (looking up)
                        You bastards.

                                        MIB #3
                        Where's John?

        REVEAL LOENGARD, who has been hiding against the wall,
        holding a chair above his head.  He smashes it down across
      the back of one of the MIB.

        Loengard instantly throws a body tackle onto the other MIB,
        throwing him into the debris.  His gun skitters to the
        ground and Sayers grabs it.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Let's go.

        Sayers nods, hands him the gun.  She grabs the photograph
      and hurries after Loengard.

        EXT. GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Loengard and Sayers run to the Chevy, jump inside and peel
      out into the street.

        EXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - DAY

      An entirely non-descript, non-chain establishment in the
        Georgia countryside.  The Chevy is parked outside.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT102.

      INT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - GUEST ROOM - DAY

        Loengard sits on the bed while Sayers paces. They are in a
        state of paranoid, frightened shock.

                                        SAYERS
                        Okay, they know we did it now,
                        there's no doubt about that.

                                        LOENGARD
                        If we call anyone, Bach could be
                          listening.  Then he's got a road
                        map straight to us.

      As if in answer, there's a KNOCK at the door.  Loengard
        reaches into the nightstand, produces a small handgun taken
        from the MIB at their apartment.  He nods to Sayers to
        answer the door.  He'll cover her.

        Sayers opens the door.  It's the motel MANAGER, standing
        with tears in her eyes.

                                        MANAGER
                        I'm just coming by in case anybody
                        hasn't heard.

                                        SAYERS
                        Heard ... about what?

                                        MANAGER
                                  (indicates TV)
                        Just turn it on.

      The manager dabs at her eyes, moves away to knock on another
        door.  Sayers closes the door and Loengard turns on the TV.

                                        LOENGARD
                        This is strange.

      The TV warms up.  There, in black-and-white, they see an
        obviously distraught WALTER CRONKITE looking into the
        camera, his voice breaking:

                                        CRONKITE (T.V.)
                        From Dallas, Texas, a flash,

                                  (looks at clock)
                        Some thirty-eight minutes ago.

      As the CAMERA MOVES IN ON LOENGARD, we hear:

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        At that exact instant, Kim and I
                        knew we were the only two people in
                        the world we could trust.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT103.

      For a moment, Loengard and Sayers are too destroyed to
        speak.  They hug, tears falling down Sayers' face as the TV
        drones on with continuing details of the assassination.
        Loengard seems to harden in bitter anger.

        EXT./INT. THE CHEVY - DAY

        Driving in silence, Loengard and Sayers speed down a country
        highway.  Loengard grips the wheel while Sayers stares out
      the window, face red and puffy, but crying no more tears.

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        Bach told us we were in a war, that
                        people died in wars.  Well, the
                        first shots had just been fired.

                                        SAYERS
                        We killed the President, John.

        Loengard continues staring straipht ahead.  His reply is
        hard and emphatic.

                                        LOENGARD
                        No.

                                        SAYERS
                        We told him and now he's dead.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Kim, you can't know what we know
                        and do nothing.

                                        SAYERS
                        They can't win, John.  We can't let
                        them.

        Loengard looks over at Sayers, appreciating her courage.

                                        LOENGARD
                        We have the thing they fear the
                        most, you know.

        Sayers looks over to Loengard who stares hard at the future
        ahead.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        The truth.

      As they look at each other, Sayers gives a shiver.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        Are you cold?  You want my jacket?

                                        SAYERS
                        Just put your arm around me.

        Loengard places his arm around Sayers, pulls her close.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT104.

      EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

      As the Chevy moves through the countryside, we hear the Dark
        Skies Theme -- FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH (written by Stephen
        Stills, performed for this series by Chris Isaak) -- as it
        foreshadows the music and the times ahead for the series.

                        There's something happening here.
                        What it is ain't exactly clear.
                        There's a man with a gun over there.
                        Telling me I got to beware.

                        I think it's time we stop, hey,
                        What's that sound?
                          Everybody look what's goin' down.

                        There's battle lines bein' drawn,
                        Nobody's right if everybody's wrong.
                        Young people speakin' their mind,
                        Gettin' so much resistance from behind.

                        I think it's time we stop, hey,
                        What's that sound?
                          Everybody look what's going down.

                        Paranoia strikes deep,
                        Into your life it will ceep.
                        It starts when you're always afraid,
                        Step out of line,
                        The man come and take you away.

                        It's time we stop, hey,
                        What's that sound?
                          Everybody look what's goin' down.

      As the car crests a hill, storm clouds are gathering in an
          increasingly dark sky, and we:
