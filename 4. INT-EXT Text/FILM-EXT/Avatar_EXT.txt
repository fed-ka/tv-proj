A SCREECH OF BRAKES as a vehicle WIPES FRAME, revealing --
JAKE SULLY, a scarred and scruffy combat vet, sitting in a
beat up carbon-fiber wheelchair. At 22, his eyes are
hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured
pain beyond his years.
Jake stares upward at the levels of the city. MAGLEV TRAINS
WHOOSH overhead on elevated tracks, against a sky of garish
advertizing.
JAKE (V.O.)
They can fix a spinal, if you've got the
money. But not on vet benefits, not in
this economy.
The traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the
crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair. Most of the people
wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air. In a
LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous,
isolated souls.
THE BOUNCER hurls Jake out the door, sending him SPRAWLING on
the pavement. A moment later, his chair CRASHES down on him,
banging across the alley, landing in the trash.
Jake struggles to rise on one elbow. He's bleeding and
bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight.
JAKE
I hope you realize you've just lost a
customer!
He collapses onto his back, panting.
JAKE
(to himself)
Candy ass bitch.
He stares upwards at the levels of the city. MAGTRAINS ROAR
overhead. It starts to RAIN. He just lies there, blinking --
then shouts jauntily to no one in particular --
JAKE
If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'!
CAMERA PULLS BACK high and wide, as Jake lies spread-eagled
amongst the trash, getting drenched.
TWO LONG SHADOWS enter FRAME, coming to rest across him.
4.
Jake sees two pairs of SHINY SHOES stop next to him.
He
squints up at --
TWO MEN. Matching suits. Their features unremarkable and
blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors.
AGENT 1
Are you Jake Sully?
JAKE
Step off.
You're ruinin' my good mood.
AGENT 2
It's about your brother.
CUT TO:
Against the cold infinity
of stars glides an INTERSTELLAR
SPACECRAFT -- ISV VENTURE
STAR. As it moves past like an
endless train, we realize
this thing is ENORMOUS -- over half
a mile long. PAN WITH IT
180 to REVEAL --
A GAS-GIANT PLANET called POLYPHEMUS, ringed with dozens of
moons which cast beauty-mark shadows on its vast face.
The ISV diminishes away from us toward the largest MOON-- a
blue and surprisingly Earth-like world called PANDORA. The
ship dwindles to a speck against the BLUE MOON.
CUT TO:
ISV Venture Star drifts above a spectacular vista -- the
sapphire seas and unfamiliar continents of Pandora.
CLOSE ON ISV -- two massive "VALKYRIE" SHUTTLES are mated to
a DOCKING NODE. One of them separates from the starship and
moves away, its thrusters FIRING in short bursts.
As the shuttle moves away, descending toward Pandora, we hear
the sound of DRUMS, building, louder and louder until we--
CUT TO:
FLYING OVER A LANDSCAPE of massive cliffs and towering mesas
carpeted in rainforest. Great scarves of cloud swirl around
the mesa tops. A primeval landscape, vast and forbidding.
The trees are alien, the color too cyan. There are
waterfalls, rivers, and distant flocks of WINGED CREATURES.
Suddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to --
AN OPEN-PIT MINE. A lifeless crater -- as if a giant cookie-
cutter took a chunk out of the world. Down among the
terraces are EXCAVATORS and TRUCKS the size of three story
buildings.
And beyond the mine is the HUMAN COLONY --
7.
HELL'S GATE is a cluster of squat concrete and steel
structures surrounded by chain-link FENCE 10 meters high,
topped with razor wire.
At the corners are towers with automated SENTRY GUNS
swiveling on servo mounts.
Visible beyond the gun towers, the VALKYRIE SHUTTLE roars in
across the treetops. VECTORING NOZZLES change angle,
bringing the ship to a SLOW HOVER.
Through a screen of jungle canopy, we see the VALKYRIE
thunder overhead. Camera TILTS with it until leaves block
the view.
A BLUE INHUMAN HAND reaches INTO SHOT, parting the foliage to
reveal the shuttle hover-taxiing across the compound.
REVERSE -- ECU of two intense, cat-like golden EYES watching.
The CREW CHIEF stomps down the aisle yelling --
CREW CHIEF
Exopacks on!
Passengers don their EXO-PACK breathing gear with practiced
moves. Everybody except JAKE, who's turning his this way and
that trying to figure out the straps.
CREW CHIEF
Remember people, you lose your mask
you're unconscious in 20 seconds and
you're dead in four minutes. Let's nobody
be dead today, it looks bad on my report.
The crew chief stops by Jake long enough to bark --
CREW CHIEF
Exopack on, let's go!
BENEATH THE SHUTTLE air blasts outward for a hundred meter
radius as it settles onto its landing gear.
INSIDE everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles
ready. Rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks --
and we DIP DOWN to find Jake, wheelchair putting him at the
level of everyone else's WAISTS.
8.
THE CARGO RAMP OPENS with a hydraulic whine.
CREW CHIEF
Go directly into the base! Do not stop!
Go straight inside!
HAND-HELD, running with the arriving colonists who double
time down the ramp. They jog across the exposed apron toward
a walkway covered in CHAINLINK which leads to the complex.
Inside the chain-link tunnel are a couple of SEC-OPS
TROOPERS, CORPORAL LYLE WAINFLEET and PRIVATE FIKE. Sec-Ops
is the colony's private security force. These guys are laid
back, hardened, and haggard.
WAINFLEET
Look at all that new meat.
THEIR POV -- Jake rolls down the ramp.
FIKE
Check it out, man.
Meals on wheels.
WAINFLEET
That is just wrong.
Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as --
A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy
wheels. He notices something sticking in the tires --
ARROWS. The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the
advanced technology.
Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and
heavily armed, they are AT-99 "SCORPION" GUNSHIPS.
MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4
meters tall -- patrol the perimeter. They are heavily
armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90.
Beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds
of feet high.
A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS
light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off
the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege.
WAINFLEET and Fike give Jake and his chair the hairy eyeball
as he approaches.
JAKE
What're you two limpdicks starin' at?
As Jake rolls past, SOMETHING SWOOPS down behind him and --
9.
K-KRASH! SMASHES against the chain-link right next to his
head.
A vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs
against the steel. It STABS at him through the chain link
with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto. A STINGBAT.
WAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL.
It drops off
the fence, tail still lashing.
WAINFLEET
Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a
wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up
in one.
Jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien.
ON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED
FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair
through the tunnel below.
The hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long
parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen's claws raked
across it. The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem
hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Criss-crossed by scars.
The MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky.
He eyes
are an icy steel gray.
HIS POV -- the mighty POLYPHEMUS seems to fill the sky,
beyond the clouds.
MAN (V.O.)
You are not in Kansas any more...
CUT TO:
Jake emerges, blinking in the morning sun. He finds himself
in the AVATAR COMPOUND -- a living and training area.
Nearby, a couple of AVATARS are playing one-on-one in front
of a (non-regulation height) basketball net. Others go about
their daily activities around the compound.
20.
Jake flexes his legs -- JUMPS -- and lands a little
unsteadily, but his expression is joyful.
He takes a few steps and breaks into a RUN. People are
calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn't hear them -- he's
running. RUNNING!
He finds himself in the COMPOUND GARDEN, and stops amid
neatly tended rows of ALIEN PLANTS. He looks down, wiggling
his toes in the warm soil. Then inhales deeply -- revelling
in the alien smells -- earth, plants, the nearby forest. He
looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world.
GRACE (O.S.)
Hey Marine!
Jake turns at the familiar voice to see --
A statuesque FEMALE AVATAR walking toward him. AVATAR GRACE
is magnificent, with panther thighs, flat muscular stomach
and firm athlete's breasts. She wears shorts and a T-shirt.
In human years she would be about 35.
JAKE
Grace?
GRACE
Well who'd you expect, numbnuts?
Think
fast!
She throws him a piece of Pandoran fruit, which he catches.
GRACE
Motor control is looking good.
Jake bites into the fruit, the juice running down his chin.
NORM (O.S.)
Hey, check it out.
Jake turns to see NORM'S AVATAR posing like a bodybuilder --
chest shot, back shot, bi's.
NORM
I am a living god.
CUT TO:
A WIDE SHOT of the terraced crater of the UNOBTANIUM MINE.
A
quiet beat, then --
21.
K-WHOOOOM! The entire face of one terrace is blown skyward
in a chain of EXPLOSIONS. The "shot" blasts hundreds of tons
of rock loose.
LONG LENS ANGLES of enormous WHEEL-LOADERS shovelling up ore-
rich rock and dropping it into DUMP TRUCKS.
A wall of steel FILLS FRAME. The DOZER BLADE crushes
everything in its path, reducing trees to kindling.
WIDER, showing the CLEAR-CUTTING operation near the mine, as
a road is cut through the jungle. Remotely operated DOZERS
three stories tall rip into the tree-line.
One of the dozers has rotating SLASH-CUTTER, a vicious
spinning head, mounted on a hydraulic arm, that hogs through
the enormous tree trunks in a spray of wood-shrapnel.
The heavy machines are escorted by AMPSUITS. COLONEL
QUARITCH, on foot, leads a squad of troopers wearing
breathing masks and carrying almighty big AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
A BANSHEE -- a fearsome aerial predator -- HURTLES from
above, diving toward them on wings 3 meters across. We get a
glimpse of glassy fangs before --
P-P-POOM! Quaritch cranks off three rapid SHOTS with his
massive sidearm, and the creature drops with a SHRIEK.
It crashes near them and Quaritch FIRES two more well placed
rounds. The newbies stare at the thing's barracuda teeth.
QUARITCH
For you pogues, this is a banshee. A
small one. See, they like it when I
bring fresh meat out here. And this
clearcutting really stirs up the hornet's
nest. So keep your head on a swivel. If
it moves, shoot it. If you're not sure
it's moving -- shoot it! If it looks like
a bunch of flowers you want to take home
to Sally Rottencrotch -- SHOOT IT!
What're you gonna do?
TROOPERS
Shoot it, sir!
QUARITCH
Outstanding. Let's roll.
22.
Quaritch leads his squad into the gloom of the forest, his
eyes scanning. Flanking the squad, LYLE WAINFLEET drives an
AMPSUIT, his massive feet CRASHING through the underbrush.
As his gaze comes down, he sees something ahead of him on the
trail -- an intricate TOTEM of woven sticks, bones and
feathers hanging across the trail like an orb-weaver's web.
He tears it down with the barrel of his rifle, and stomps it
into the mud as he moves on.
FLYING over a carpet of rainforest, past sheer cliffs and
cloud-wreathed mesas. TRUDY'S SAMSON TILT-ROTOR chases its
shadow across the treetops. Though big as a Blackhawk, it is
tiny in the vast primeval landscape.
ANGLE THROUGH the open side doors of the Samson. Trooper
WAINFLEET, in exo-mask and body armor, leans on his door gun,
scanning for aerial predators.
In avatar form JAKE, GRACE and NORM watch the forest
unrolling beneath them, the wind blasting their clothes.
Jake mans the other door gun, his feet propped on the skids.
28.
TRUDY flies from a pressurized cockpit. She banks to follow a
shallow river.
TRUDY (INTERCOM)
Sturmbeest herd, one o'clock.
Norm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see--
A herd of STURMBEEST -- massive six-legged creatures
reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river.
GRACE
Looks like a bull, six cows and some
juveniles.
NORM
The bull has the red on the dorsal armor?
Grace nods approvingly.
TIME CUT -- Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight
from a lake, startled by the Samson. They skim the water
above their own reflections. TETRAPTERONS.
TIME CUT -- the ground drops away as the Samson flies over a
WATERFALL hundreds of feet high. Trudy banks hard, rolling
in on the gorge below like it's a gun-run.
Wainfleet WHOOPS while Norm looks like he's about to puke.
WAINFLEET
Yo Chacon!
Get some!
Jake grins into the airstream.
CUT TO:
A small meadow among towering trees. The fern-like "grass"
is beaten down in waves by the rotor-wash as the Samson
settles to the ground.
Jake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and
hefts it like an assault rifle.
He and Wainfleet leap out to secure the LZ, scanning the tree-
line warily, weapons aimed.
Grace jogs forward to the cockpit, motioning Trudy to shut
down. Trudy kills the Samson's TURBINES.
Grace, towering over Wainfleet, motions him to hang back.
29.
GRACE
Stay with the ship.
(for Jake)
One idiot with a gun's enough.
WAINFLEET
Whatever you say, Doc.
Jake takes point as they enter the jungle.
WAINFLEET
(LAUGHING)
Ya'll have fun out there.
The forest engulfs JAKE, GRACE and NORM in cyan gloom. The
shadows are alive with the CHITTERING sounds of unseen alien
wildlife.
TRACKING WITH JAKE as he moves through the foliage, hyper-
alert -- looking around like a tourist in Hell.A monkey-like
PROLEMURIS leaping from limb to limb overhead, flashing
through the sunlight streaming down in shafts.
A PLANT with swaying tendrils which reach toward Jake as he
passes.
This forest is more alive than any on Earth, with plants that
react and move like animals. Jake white-knuckles his rifle
as if every shadow conceals razor-fanged death.
GRACE
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.
She pushes ahead of him on the trail, forcing him to lower
his muzzle as he follows her. Grace moves nimbly on the
path, seemingly unconcerned.
CUT TO:
WIDE SHOT as the party moves between the huge trees, tiny as
ants. The trail has gotten steeper, the going tougher.
CUT TO:
They enter a clearing with an OVERGROWN BUILDING made of
timbers cut from the local trees, with a thatch roof. It is
covered with vines as the jungle reclaims it.
30.
NORM
How will they know we're here?
GRACE
I'm sure they're watching us right now.
Norm gulps. Jake looks behind him as they approach the
school, feeling unseen eyes.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON Grace's blue hand gently brushing away soil,
exposing a tangle of ROOT TENDRILS.
GRACE
See, right here where the roots of the
two trees interact.
WIDER -- GRACE and NORM crouch among enormous octopoidal
roots. She takes a tiny sample using a needle-like probe.
Norm uses a digital DEVICE to scan the roots.
JAKE, bored, scouts ahead a few meters.
He comes to a GLADE filled with shoulder-high SPIRAL PLANTS
called HELICORADIANS.
He BRUSHES one and SHTOONK! -- it SUCKS DOWN into a tube in
the ground so quickly it seems to simply vanish.
Curious, Jake touches another -- SHTOONK! And another --
like popping balloons after a party. SHTOONK! SHTOONK!
SHTOONK!
A chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into
the ground, REVEALING --
A HAMMERHEAD TITANOTHERE. Like a six-legged rhinoceros, but
twice that size. Its massive, low-slung head has projections
of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark.
Its baleful eyes lock onto him.
Jake raises his rifle.
Grace, alerted by the creature's SNORTS, runs to where she
can see the tableau. She presses her THROAT MIKE.
GRACE
Don't shoot. You'll piss it off.
32.
The bull HAMMERHEAD bellows and lowers its 3 meter wide
sledgehammer of a skull.
JAKE
It's already pissed off!
GRACE
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.
Jake starts to back away.
The hammerhead bellows again,
pawing the earth.
GRACE
It's a territorial threat display. Do not
run, or he'll charge.
JAKE
What do I do?
GRACE
Hold your ground!
The hammerhead SLASHES its head sideways, splintering
saplings. It bellows again, lowers its head and CHARGES --
Jake SCREAMS at the top of his lungs, spreads his arms wide
and runs straight at the thing.
It STOPS abruptly, with an oversized BLEAT.
ON JAKE -- amazed the gambit worked.
JAKE
Oh yeah!
Who's bad?! That's right.
SOMETHING rises up behind him out of focus --
A THANATOR. The most awesome land predator the universe has
ever conceived This thing could eat a T-rex and have the
Alien for desert.
It is a black six-limbed panther from Hell, with an armored
head and massive distensible jaws.
JAKE, unaware of the advancing thanator, is still bracing the
hammerhead --
JAKE
That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch!
The bull wheels around, TRUMPETING in fear, and CRASHES away
through splintering undergrowth.
33.
JAKE
That's right motherf--
A guttural SNARL behind him. Jake spins in time to see --
THREE TONS of rippling thanator LAUNCH over him, landing
between him and the hammerhead. The ground shakes.
The thanator emits an earsplitting ROAR, enraged that the
hammerhead got away. It twists on itself, turning to face
Jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal HISS.
JAKE
What about this one?
Run, don't run?
What?
GRACE
Run.
Definitely RUN!
Jake BOLTS as --
The thanator LEAPS after him and --
Jake launches himself between two large trunks, forcing the
beast to claw its way around to the side while --
Jake scrambles up -- around -- over a tangle of roots and --
SK-RASH!! CLAWS SLASH the air behind him, EXPLODING bark off
a trunk as --
JAKE wills himself forward in a frenzy. With rippling muscle
the beast is airborne again, blacking out the sun but --
JAKE dives under a massive root system, and --
CRASH! Kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the
root-trunks above him. Claws SLASH down next to him as he
rolls and crawls --
Glistening jaws SMASH and SNAP against the barrier trunks,
sending chunks of wood flying. It's spittle sprays across
Jake, jaws inches away as --
He rolls onto his back, and FIRES his AR point blank but the
rifle is SNATCHED out of his hands. The beast SCREECHES an
ungodly WAIL of pain and rage and -- RIPS the ENTIRE TRUNK
away. Jake scrambles to escape but --
GLISTENING JAWS lunge downward, SNAP SHUT and --
The creature rips Jake out of the tree, shaking him like a
junkyard dog with a rabbit, only --
34.
It has him by the BACKPACK, so Jake unlatches it and --
He FLIES FREE as the thanator crushes the pack with its
teeth. Giving Jake a moment to sprint away, but --
With a hideous BELLOW the thanator crashes after him,
splintering trees.
JAKE RUNS in a blur, dodging between trunks as a glistening
black tornado shreds the forest behind him and --
He sees WATER ahead and DIVES OUTWARD with all his might --
The thanator's jaws SNAP SHUT inches behind him as he flies
out into open space and --
JAKE SPLASHES down into a swiftly moving river.
The thanator LEAPS DOWN AFTER HIM, pursuing from rock to
rock, its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon.
Jake ducks under as -- FWHOOSH! -- black claws SLASH past
his face amid turbulent bubbles.
A WATERFALL ahead. Jake is swept over the falls, with the
thanator SWIPING at him from a rock, just MISSING and --
Jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract.
The water boils below the cataract. Jake's head bursts
through the surface, and he gasps for breath.
He is carried along by the current, but manages to grab a
limb on a fallen tree. He weakly pulls himself up, and just
lies there gasping on the trunk.
Above him, on the cliff, the THANATOR BELLOWS, a roar which
echoes across the jungle.
CUT TO:
JAKE, wet and bruised, crouches under a screen of giant
leaves.
He hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with
his knife, forming a crude but sharp tip.
TRACKING with Jake as he walks through the forest like it's a
minefield, carrying his SPEAR white-knuckled. He is freaked
and hyper-alert.
35.
The trees here are a hundred meters high, blocking out the
sky. A few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the
cyan gloom.
POV FROM ABOVE -- looking down through leaves we watch Jake
move warily through the forest.
ECU -- TWO GOLDEN EYES, bright in the shadows.
DOWNANGLE as Jake passes under a tree limb. Invisible to
him, draped on the limb like a leopard, is a striking NA'VI
GIRL. She watches, only her eyes moving.
She is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders,
and nubile breasts. And she is devastatingly beautiful --
for a girl with a tail. In human age she would be 18. Her
name is NEYTIRI(nay-Tee-ree).
Jake passes less than 2 meters beneath her, oblivious.
NEYTIRI rises soundlessly. In one fluid, sinuous movement
she NOCKS an arrow to her BOW and DRAWS, aiming RIGHT AT
JAKE. Utterly silent.
Below her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his
THROAT.
ON NEYTIRI as she follows him with the bow, muscles tensing
for the shot --
-- and SOMETHING drifts down in front of her, F.G.
She
hesitates.
RACK FOCUS to the tip of the arrow -- where a single
WOODSPRITE floats down to land on the arrow-head.Like a
dandelion seed, but larger, the WOODSPRITE waves its silky
CILIA, feather light, as it balances on the deadly point. It
glows faintly in the dark shadows.
NEYTIRI frowns, puzzled, and LOWERS her bow slowly.
The
woodsprite WHIRLS away into the gloom.
CUT TO:
GRACE and NORM peer down into the shadowed forest as TRUDY
banks in a search pattern.
TRUDY (INTERCOM)
I'm going to have to call it, guys. We're
not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's
orders.
36.
Grace looks to the west.
The sun setting behind alien trees.
GRACE
Shit.
TRUDY
Sorry, Doc. He's just gonna have to hang
on `till morning.
GRACE
He's not going to make it till morning.
Grace stares into the dark forest as the Samson banks hard,
thundering away toward the setting sun.
CUT TO:
LONG LENS-- POLYPHEMUS. The giant planet rises behind the
black trees.
Jake's got a new problem. He sees shapes moving with liquid
grace in the NIGHT shadows behind him. He is being stalked by
a pack of VIPERWOLVES.
Jake catches only glimpses -- a glint of eyes, a slinking
black movement -- then nothing. Darkness.
TIME CUT -- TIGHT ON Jake's hands as he knots his T-shirt
around the butt end of the spear.
ANGLE ON THICK SAP trickling down a tree-trunk. Jake jams
the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it.
A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch.
The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing,
leaping shadows. Jake turns warily as he moves along the
trail.
Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES.
Another pair flanking him beside the trail. Black-on-black
SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid.
He looks up -- sees one cross a limb overhead.
Another on
his opposite flank.
Then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic LAUGH.
The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey.
They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees.
37.
JAKE RUNS by torch-light, on the edge of panic. He reaches a
steep banked stream and -- without thinking -- runs across it
on a horizontal trunk --
-- and STOPS DEAD on the other side. The torch illuminates
GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail. The
viperwolves have him encircled.
The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each
other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on
his legs from behind but --
JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face.
It yips and goes
past, but ANOTHER moves in --
He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS,
retreating, baring its fangs.
Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees
what he's up against.
The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with
shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS.
Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums.
Jake realizes that he is making his final stand.
He whirls
the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay --
And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a
lightning bolt and the fear is gone.
JAKE
(SCREAMING)
I don't have all goddamn night! Come on!
Come on!
With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK.
Jake CRACKS the spear down on one, then SPINS as --
ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it, striking
true, but --
Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes
flying. Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as--
A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in
pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which --
CUTS deep into the beast's shoulder and it lets go.
JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf
leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand. Jake
tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as --
38.
THREE WOLVES charge at once.
The nearest LEAPS at his throat
just as --
THUNK!! -- an ARROW appears in its chest.
The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight.
He pushes it
off in time to see --
A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw
and FIRE in one fluid motion. AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another
wolf falls.
NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the
skull of a circling wolf.
ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but
rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.
Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest.
SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away,
but --
It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its
throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.
MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, CRACKING IT
across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.
NEYTIRI
Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!
The wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past
them. Finally they break and run, with Neytiri chasing and--
They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them--
NEYTIRI
Raaaarrrr!
Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his
weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it
and looks up at --
NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening
to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is
over, she turns.
She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him.
Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.
JAKE
Wait, don't --
39.
Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still
see. In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest
is transformed.
The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE -- spots and
patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light.
Jake scrambles to recover his spear.
Neytiri kneels beside --
A DYING WOLF. It's CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air,
trying to raise its head. She pulls her KNIFE from its
chest.
NEYTIRI
(in Na'vi)
Forgive me, my brother.
She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches
its head gently, regarding it with sadness.
Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her
waist. She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling
the arrow from its heart.
JAKE
Look, um, I know you probably don't
understand this. But -- thanks. Thank
you. I owe you.
Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead
animal.
NEYTIRI
(in Na'vi)
Forgive me. May your spirit run with the
Great Mother.
JAKE
I would have been screwed if you hadn't
come along --
She rises and walks away without looking at Jake.
JAKE
Hey, wait. Wait!
Where you goin'?
He crashes through some plants, catching up to her.
JAKE
Slow down a second will you. I just want
to thank you for killing those --
He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and --
40.
WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a
fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat.
He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who
speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English.
NEYTIRI
Don't thank! You don't thank for this!
This is sad. Very sad, only.
JAKE
Okay, I'm sorry.
Whatever I did -- I'm
sorry.
She gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves.
NEYTIRI
All this is your fault! They did not need
to die.
JAKE
They attacked me.
How'm I the bad guy
HERE--
She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.
NEYTIRI
Your fault! You are like a baby, making
noise, don't know what to do. You should
not come here, all of you! You only come
and make problems. Only.
Jake gets up, slowly, facing her.
JAKE
Okay, fine, you love your little forest
friends. So why not just let them kill
my ass? What's the thinking?
CU Neytiri -- looking away. Finally, reluctantly, her eyes
MEET HIS for the first time -- a riveting gaze with those big
gold orbs.
NEYTIRI
Why save you?
JAKE
Yes, why save me?
NEYTIRI
You have a strong heart.
No fear.
She leans closer --
41.
NEYTIRI
But stupid! Ignorant like a child!
She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her.
TRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT.
WIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which
forms an elevated walkway.
Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far
above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move
through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST.
JAKE
If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should
teach me.
NEYTIRI
Sky people can not learn.
You do not
See.
She leaps to another elevated root.
Jake follows, surprised
that he made it.
JAKE
Whooaa.
He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace.
JAKE
Then teach me to "see."
She stops and he almost runs into her.
NEYTIRI
No one can teach you to See.
Then she turns and trots on.
They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a
horizontal trunk big as an oak.
WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers
silver in the Polyphemus-light. Vines hang down a hundred
feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other
night flyers.
JAKE
Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just
got off on the wrong foot and --
42.
Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height.
JAKE
--you just have to get to know me. I'm
Jake. Jake Sull--
A vine catches his spear and spins him off balance.
He drops
the spear and almost falls off the root.
JAKE
Whooaaa -- shit!
Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He
watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river.
She pulls him upright. Shouts at him in English and Na'vi.
JAKE
I need your help.
NEYTIRI
You should not be here.
JAKE
So take me with you.
NEYTIRI
No. You go back.
DOWN ANGLE FROM FAR ABOVE -- several WOODSPRITES float down
through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently
toward Jake and Neytiri.
NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see --
The WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards
Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head.
JAKE
(off her amazed look)
What?
More woodsprites gather around him.
Several ALIGHT on him.
Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow
he's not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing
all over his arms, hands, body.
JAKE
What are they?
CU NEYTIRI -- reacting with a mixture of wonder and dread.
43.
NEYTIRI
Atokirina'. Seeds of the Great Tree --
very pure spirits.
Jake -- now a pulsing, glowing, fluttering MASS OF LIGHT --
moves one hand slowly, not wanting to break the spell. He
studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until --
-- WHOOSSHH! the woodsprites whirl up and away, scattering
into the darkness.
JAKE
What was that all about?
Neytiri seems shaken.
She seizes his hand and pulls him
after her.
NEYTIRI
Come!
CUT TO:
TRACKING WITH JAKE as he gazes about him in growing wonder.
He touches leaves as he passes, watching the bioluminescence
shiver through them.
Jake looks down as -- they cross a bed of purple MOSS which
reacts to the pressure of their footsteps. Rings of green
light, like ripples on a pond, expand outward from each
footfall. Exploding rings of light where his feet touch
down. Dream-like, surreal beauty.
WIDE ON THEM as they run over a large root, across a mirror-
like POOL at the base of a WATERFALL.
Jake follows Neytiri, running along a raised root-trunk.
JAKE
What's your name?
JAKE hears WHOOSH-WHOOSH and snaps a look as a BOLO flies at
him, spinning end for end and --
SHWHAP!! -- tangles around his legs.
He topples off the root
and crashes into the foliage below.
JAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as --
SEVERAL NA'VI RIDERS thunder toward him. They are riding
DIREHORSES -- six-legged, armor-skinned alien Clydesdales.
44.
We see that the riders' QUEUES are connected to the horses'
long moth-like antennae -- a neural-link with which they can
command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons.
The riders aim bows and spears at Jake as they approach. Jake
turns to bolt, but --
NA'VI HUNTERS melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed --
blocking his retreat.
Neytiri drops to the ground next to Jake and confronts the
LEAD RIDER. She shouts sharply in Na'vi --
NEYTIRI
(SUBTITLED)
Tsu'tey, what are you doing?! He is my
captive!
TSU'TEY(tsu-Tay)is young and powerfully built, with sculpted
features and a proud jawline, piercing eyes. Tsu'tey swings
off his mount with fluid grace.
TSU'TEY
(SUBTITLED)
These demons are forbidden here. I will
kill this one as a lesson to the others!
Tsu'tey draws his bow but Neytiri leaps between him and Jake,
confronting him warrior to warrior.
NEYTIRI
(SUBTITLED)
Stop! There has been a sign. This is a
matter for the Tsahik.
Tsu'tey clenches his jaw with frustration -- frustration with
her as much as the situation. He turns and angrily remounts
his direhorse, barking a command to the HUNTERS.
TSU'TEY
(SUBTITLED)
Bring him.
They grab Jake and haul him to his feet. Encircled by spears
and bows, he is shoved forward along the trail, as Tsu'tey
and the others ride ahead.
CUT TO:
JAKE is hauled roughly toward Neytiri's village, which is
sheltered inside one of the GREAT TREES. HOMETREE is 250
meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the
largest Sequoia, and a base of massive mangrove-pillars.
45.
TSU'TEY rides inside the columns at the base of Hometree,
shouting an ululating WARNING.
Jake is force-marched through the pillars into --
JAKE nervously grips the surcingle of the mare. Neytiri holds
its nose-ring while Jake clumsily mounts.
Jake bends one of its ANTENNAE down to the tip of his queue.
He hesitantly touches them together and --
55.
TIGHT SHOT -- the tendrils INTERWEAVE.
Jake's PUPILS DILATE and his mouth drops open. The horse's
eyes also go wide and it HONKS nervously. Neytiri touches her
fingertips to the neural interface.
NEYTIRI
This is shahaylu -- the bond. Feel her
heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong
legs.
Jake closes his eyes, nodding.
One with the horse.
TSU'TEY and another young hunter come out of the forest
leading TWO DIREHORSES. The magnificent animals drink from
the edge of the pool. Tsu'tey watches Jake's riding lesson
with disdain.
NEYTIRI
You may tell her what to do --
(she touches her head)
-- inside. For now, say where to go.
JAKE
Forward.
The horse LAUNCHES into a GALLOP. Jake flops around, with no
idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly THROWN OFF. He
lands painfully in the mud.
He gets up, brushing mud off knees and ass, as Neytiri leads
the horse back to him.
NEYTIRI
Again.
SERIES OF JUMP CUTS -- Jake falls off the horse in various
ways, seemingly landing harder each time.
ON JAKE, face down in the mud of the riverbank. He painfully
rises to hands and knees. Which is when he sees --
TSU'TEY and another HUNTER thundering across the shallow
river on their direhorses. Spray blasts up from their
hooves.
Jake stands, covered in mud, as Tsu'tey stops his horse next
to him, looking down with disdain.
TSU'TEY
You should go away.
56.
JAKE
(to Neytiri)
I knew this guy could speak English.
Tsu'tey turns to Neytiri, who is leading the old mare back.
TSU'TEY
(SUBTITLED)
This alien will learn nothing.
A rock
Sees more.
She sighs in agreement. Tsu'tey and the other hunter wheel
their horses around and THUNDER OFF into the woods.
NEYTIRI gestures to Jake's horse.
NEYTIRI
Again.
CUT TO:
OPS CENTER - NIGHT
Grouped around a table are JAKE, COLONEL QUARITCH, SELFRIDGE
and few ENGINEERS and OFFICERS. Jake is talking them through
plans he's made of Hometree's inner structure.
JAKE
You've got outer columns, then a
secondary ring here, and an inner ring.
Then a core structure, it's like a
spiral, that's how they move up and down.
QUARITCH
I'm going to need accurate scans of all
these columns.
JAKE
Roger that.
ANGLE ON MAX, at the stairwell. He's been watching Jake
talking rapidly to Quaritch, but can't hear him. Frowning,
he backs away, down the stairs.
CUT TO:
A SAMSON THUNDERS over the rainforest, climbing into the mist-
shrouded mountains.
In the SEALED COCKPIT, Norm is up front, sitting left seat so
Trudy can talk him through the flight controls. Jake and
Grace are behind them, in the jump-seats.
Grace and Norm's UNCONSCIOUS AVATARS ride in the open back
compartment.
TRUDY
It only takes tiny inputs.
Here, put
your hand on the cyclic --
She points to the stick between her knees. Norm hesitantly
reaches over and rests his hand on hers.
TRUDY
Feel how small the moves are? You barely
have to think it, and the aircraft
reacts.
ON NORM -- reacting to tiny inputs from the hot lady-pilot.
THE SAMSON is dwarfed by enormous ARCHES OF ROCK.
GRACE
See these magnetic formations.
We're
getting close.
TRUDY
Yeah we are. Look at my instruments.
On the dash, many of the displays are fritzing out.
58.
GRACE
Yup. We're in the flux vortex.
AHEAD, a cloud bank parts, revealing --
THE HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS.
Right in front of them.
NORM
Oh. My. God.
Jake leans forward between the seatbacks for a good look out
the front canopy.
JAKE'S POV -- enormous islands of rock are hovering a half
mile above the ground. They are overgrown with rainforest,
and straggly beards of vines hang down beneath them.
Waterfalls stream down the sides and dissolve into spray at
the bottom.
ON JAKE, staring in amazement.
It is both awe-inspiring and
disturbing.
Trudy turns, grinning at Jake.
TRUDY
You should see your face.
WIDE AERIAL -- the Samson is tiny as it approaches the
floating islands of rock. An archipelago among the clouds,
they cast great shadows over the forested slopes below.
JAKE (V.O.)
Yeah, so what does hold them up? Grace
explained it to me -- some kind of maglev
effect because unobtanium is a
superconductor, or something. At least
somebody understands it. Just not me.
CUT TO:
A remote RESEARCH STATION -- TWO SHACKS and a few clusters of
instruments perched on a promontory near the Hallelujah
Mountains. The shacks are AIRLIFT MODULES the size of buses.
THE SAMSON LANDS, beating the grass with its rotor-wash. The
humans hop out, wearing MASKS.
They move toward the Shack, taking in the spectacular
panorama.
CUT TO:
59.
LOOKING DOWN the central shaft of Hometree, 80 meters to the
ground. Villagers are ant-like.
Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core
trunk like a lemur. He climbs the last section, arriving out
of breath beside her. She leads him OUTSIDE, onto --
A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see
other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like
enormous umbrellas above the rainforest.
NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of
STRUCTURE -- a WEB made of thick woven fiber. DARK SHAPES
clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND.
Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS. One of the
shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight.
A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE. Much larger than the forest
banshees, this thing is taller than a Na'vi with a 10 meter
wingspan. A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it
alights on the branch right in front of her.
JAKE
Holy shit.
NEYTIRI
Do not look in her eye.
Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it SNATCHES and
gulps down. She murmurs to it and strokes its NECK.
It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the
shadows nearby answer.
Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the
Banshee's ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the
neural connection is made.
NEYTIRI
Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is
made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter
in the whole life.
She climbs smoothly onto the animal's back.
61.
NEYTIRI
To become taronyu -- Hunter -- you must
choose your own ikran. And he must choose
you.
JAKE
When?
NEYTIRI
When you are ready.
The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation.
NEYTIRI
Heeyaaahh!
Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee
DROPS off the branch. It swoops down across the forest
canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a
power climb.
Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close
SWOOPING FLYBY, and Jake instinctively ducks.
ON NEYTIRI -- flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount,
the rainforest rolling beneath her.
CUT TO:
STEREO VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- Jake has just switched on the
camera. He looks tired.
JAKE
Do I have to do this?
I need some rack.
GRACE, behind him, looks up from her MICROSCOPE, scowling.
GRACE
No -- now, when it's fresh.
JAKE
Yeah, yeah.
(to camera)
The days are starting to blur together.
The language is a bitch, but I figure
it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Repetition.
THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE:
JAKE AND NEYTIRI kneel together inside Hometree. Neytiri
touches her lips with her fingertips.
62.
JAKE
Seyri.
She touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence.
JAKE
Ontu, mikyun, nari.
NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he
draws a longbow.
BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the
elbow, repositioning him roughly.
JAKE (V.O.)
Neytiri thinks I'm some kind of retard.
HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see --
TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm's bunk. Norm blushes
and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads.
JAKE (V.O.)
Norm's attitude has improved lately.
NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen.
NORM
Thank you?
JAKE
Ireiyo.
Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation.
NORM
Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo.
You've gotta roll
the R, r-r-r-oll it.
Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated.
JAKE (V.O.)
It's good he's back on board, but he
thinks I'm a retard too.
TRACKING WITH JAKE'S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto
a thick root, running on across the rough bark.
JAKE (V.O.)
My feet are getting tougher.
I can run
farther every day.
63.
Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are
running 30 meters above the ground.
He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up.
She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey.
JAKE (V.O.)
I have to trust my body to know what to
do. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die.
Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until --
She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows
its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and
catches another.
JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with
him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic
rush.
He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a
game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive.
Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed.
That he lived.
TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack. Thinking as he looks at
the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school.
IN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO'AT. The
Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows.
Grace's eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na'vi.
JAKE (V.O.)
I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and
Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes
me coffee before link every morning.
Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching. It is an awkward
moment between them. Grace makes the formal gesture of
greeting.
GRACE
(Na'vi, subtitled)
I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite.
NEYTIRI
I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.
ANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out
the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the
plants around her, and sniffs the air.
64.
JAKE (V.O.)
I'm learning to read the trails, the
tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest
scents and sounds.
JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as --
A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows
of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are
sheltered from predators among their parents' legs.
One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes
flight, an explosion of purple wings.
Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau.
ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her
ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are
closed. She speaks very softly to Jake --
NEYTIRI
When you hear nothing, you will hear
everything. When you see nothing, you
will See everything.
JAKE (V.O.)
Sometimes I have no idea what she's
talking about.
Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male
HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature.
Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri
watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a
beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery.
JAKE (V.O.)
It's been a month and I'm still not
allowed to make a kill. She says the
forest hasn't given permission.
OMIITED
NEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth.
She points
and he parts some leaves to see --
A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk
around her legs. She licks their faces.
JAKE (V.O.)
There's a lot of crap like that. She's
always going on about the flow of energy--
the spirits of the animals and what not --
65.
VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens.
He's
changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow. Pale.
JAKE
(SMIRKING)
I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on
the final.
Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples.
GRACE
(without looking up)
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there. You need to
listen to what she says. Try to see the
forest through their eyes.
JAKE
Excuse me -- this is my video-log here,
okay?
NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by
galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move
gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits.
CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night
forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources.
NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing
from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom
of a pool.
A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow.
ZAP!
Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly.
ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting
his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are
GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders.
Aware of her touch, Jake's focus is broken.
Their eyes meet,
and she pulls away quickly.
NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns.
Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature
on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING
perched on a frond. As he approaches --
SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a
bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening
like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee.
THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing.
66.
Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY. An
EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight.
Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until
they are all flying. And for the first time, she is
unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him.
INSIDE THE LINK -- Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He
doesn't know where he is. He weakly pushes open the lid,
blinking at the light.
JAKE (V.O.)
Everything is backwards now. Like out
there is the true world, and in here is
the dream.
TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes
focused in intense concentration. A beat -- the arrow flies.
JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede.
He dispatches it with his knife.
He speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Na'vi.
JAKE
(NA'VI)
I See you Brother, and thank you. Your
spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays
behind to become part of the People.
NEYTIRI watches with approval.
NEYTIRI
A clean kill. You are ready.
CUT TO:
TSU'TEY leads three direhorse riders up the trail -- two
TEENAGE HUNTERS and JAKE, who's riding well enough to keep
up. The horses' hooves CLOP right next to a sheer drop into a
misty canyon.
JAKE (V.O.)
Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway
to heaven. It's the test every young
hunter has to pass.
TSU'TEY signals a stop.
UP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation. Thick vine-like
trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in
their gnarled grip.
A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the
twisted vine-trunks. This is some sort of freak natural
occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the
clouds.
There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and
the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at --
One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a
nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is
drifting toward them, filling half the sky.
The Hunters dismount.
JAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds. He
turns to Tsu'tey, who is checking the young hunters' gear.
JAKE
We doin' this?
Jake leaps to catch up as Tsu'tey and the hunters swarm up
the base of the beanstalk.
CUT TO:
70.
200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along
the vine-trunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium
BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree.
JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of
a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs
over it -- it floats upward.
They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them,
the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from
one of the waterfalls hits them.
Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper
branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss.
One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass.
Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling
over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands
above.
TINY FIGURES cross a causeway of vines connecting a small
island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis.
WIDE SHOT looking down a rock face bigger than Half Dome --
the sheer side of Mons Veritatis.
Banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of
sunlight. Waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below.
A waterfall THUNDERS down into the void like a faucet of the
gods. Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below
-- a view from Olympus.
A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI'S
BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She
dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven
HOOD. It waits, docile, as --
She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu'tey leads them
through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And
Jake sees --
The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out-
croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls
with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.
71.
TSU'TEY
Jakesully will go first.
Tsu'tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two
teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough.
Tsu'tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge.
NEYTIRI
(WHISPERING)
Now you choose your ikran. This you must
feel -- inside. If he also chooses you,
move quick, like I showed. You will have
one chance.
JAKE
How will I know if he chooses me?
NEYTIRI
He will try to kill you.
JAKE
Outstanding.
Out of sight of Tsu'tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes
it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like
it didn't happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with --
The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK
and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing
rows of fangs, in a threat display.
Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended BOLO.
A LARGE MALE spreads enormous wings, SHRIEKS, and glares
straight at him.
Jake looks directly into its eyes -- and strides toward it.
JAKE
Let's dance.
The challenged banshee HISSES and leaps at him, jaws wide as--
Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then
slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT.
Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong
whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED
SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but --
72.
Jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the
banshee around the neck. It topples on its side, and he
SWARMS IT -- arms around its thrashing head.
Jake grabs its whip-like antenna and brings it toward his
queue but --
The bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! -- clocks him right in
the face, almost knocking him out and --
IT WRITHES, flinging him to the ground. He slides on the
rock and almost goes over the edge as --
NEYTIRI gasps. Tsu'tey laughs and yells mockingly.
The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way
pissed off now, but --
Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his
leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN
HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top,
pinning it and --
Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams
the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and --
The banshee stops struggling. It lies there panting.
They
are locked together, literally eye to eye.
JAKE
That's right! You're mine.
ECU BANSHEE -- the pupil like a deep black well.
Jake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over
the creature's back.
Neytiri runs to him.
NEYTIRI
First flight seals the bond. You cannot
wait.
Jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power.
He grips
a hank of the beast's main, and --
JAKE
Heeeyyyaaaah!
THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS
as they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and --
73.
They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is
almost tossed lose. The thing is SQUAWKING and SHRIEKING so
much he can't think.
JAKE
Shut the hell up!!
It does.
JAKE
Level out!
Fly straight!
It levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking "bank left"
and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy
loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath.
NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE falls into formation with him.
She signals
"follow me" and DIVES.
Jake guides his banshee clumsily after her. Neytiri's
banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while
Jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky.
THE CAMERA SWOOPS after them as Neytiri leads an arcing DIVE
around the flank of Mons Veritatis. The scenery is stunning.
They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines.
Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the
cliffs. They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge
into sunlight.
Jake is getting the hang of it. He jinks left, then right,
then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal's back.
He's reckless, fearless. Half in control and LOVING IT.
Neytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long WHOOP of joy.
CUT TO:
FLIGHT MONTAGE:
NEYTIRI squats with Jake, using her hands to explain flight
principles like one fighter pilot to another.
LOOKING DOWN a sheer cliff. SWOOOSH! Jake and Neytiri dive
their mounts STRAIGHT DOWN PAST CAMERA, pulling out and
soaring into a series of aerobatic turns.
JAKE (V.O.)
I may not be much of a horse guy.
But I
was born to do this.
74.
THEY FLY in close formation with TSU'TEY and the young
HUNTERS, 5 banshees flashing through scarves of mist.
ANOTHER DAY. Jake dives, playing hide and seek with Neytiri
among the clouds. They are wild and free in a wild world.
She grins and banks hard, diving -- catch me if you can. He
DIVES after her.
IN THE GROTTO, by firelight, JAKE'S BANSHEE snaps at a piece
of meat which he playfully pulls back. He's teaching it to
take the food more slowly. He strokes its long head.
TSU'TEY is nearby with the young hunters.
He eyes Jake with
frustrated hostility.
ANOTHER DAY -- Jake and Neytiri fly abreast, soaring easily.
She points and Jake sees --
A BIZARRE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. Arches of magnetic rock form
rainbows of stone above a deep CALDERA. In the center of the
caldera is a single, enormous WILLOW TREE, gnarled and
ancient. This, we will be told, is THE WELL OF SOULS.
CUT TO:
JAKE flies with Neytiri along a forested ridge. She is
teaching him to hunt from his banshee. They carry their bows
at the ready, scanning below them for prey.
A HUGE SHADOW covers him and Neytiri SHOUTS a warning.
Jake
looks up to see --
A LEONOPTERYX in a delta-dive, whistling straight at him.
Like a banshee, only several times larger, it is the king
predator of the air: the GREAT LEONOPTERYX.
Striped
scarlet, yellow and black, with a midnight blue crested head
-- it is both gorgeous and terrifying.
The hunter has become the prey. JAKE snap-rolls and dives
toward the forest canopy. He plummets into the gloom as --
K-CRASH -- the leonopteryx tears through foliage, following
him down, both diving like missiles and --
JAKE yanks into a hair-pin bank, right through a gap between
two huge branches --
Forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud FWOOSH of wings.
It banks away with a frustrated SHRIEK. Two flaps of its
mighty wings and it is gone, back above the canopy.
75.
CLOSE ON THE LEONOPTERYX, as its fanged mouth opens in a
bloodcurdling SCREECH which echoes among the mountains. The
lord of its domain.
ON JAKE, shaken. Neytiri flies up, her expression the Na'vi
equivalent of Oh my God. A beat -- they both crack up.
CUT TO:
JAKE, NEYTIRI and other FLYING HUNTERS swoop low above a HERD
OF STURMBEEST -- a rapids of thundering muscle. Dust rises
from this living river like steam from a python's back.
TRACKING WITH the herd. A HUNTER appears in FG, astride a
direhorse at full gallop. The sight is breathtaking. He
hurls a 3 meter spear and one of the sturmbeest CRASHES down,
flipping twice from momentum.
JAKE ROLLS IN like a fighter jet, his banshee screaming. He
draws and fires his bow. The arrow strikes true, in the
plexus between the armored shoulders and --
THE BEAST crashes to the ground. Skids to a stop in a cloud
of dust.
NEYTIRI swoops in next to Jake, arms raised and grinning
wolfishly.
CU TSU'TEY, banking around Jake's kill.
Jake looks up, and
Tsu'tey SALUTES in grudging admiration.
CUT TO:
WIDE VISTA -- mist blowing through the treetops as the
morning sun burns it away. A spectacular panorama of a vast,
primeval land.
UP ANGLE TRACKING among the trees, the sunlight shafting down
like light in a cathedral.
JAKE (V.O.)
It's hard to put in words the deep
connection the People have to the forest.
HIGH IN THE BRANCHES of a tree, Jake watches as Neytiri
gently bends a large pitcher-like flower toward her, sipping
nectar which is sweet and thick as honey. An incredibly
sensuous image.
JAKE (V.O.)
They see a network of energy that flows
through all living things. They know that
all energy is only borrowed--
MACRO SHOT of a purple flower, beaded with raindrops.
A blue
hand picks the flower.
JAKE (V.O.)
-- and one day you have to give it back.
LOOKING DOWN into a hole dug among tree roots. The body of
an old Omaticaya WOMAN lies curled there like an unborn baby
in the womb of the earth. The purple flower is gently placed
on her body, joining flowers, totems and beads.
Mo'at recites a prayer as Neytiri, acting as acolyte, places
a WOODSPRITE, a seed of the Great Tree, on the body.
Earth is poured over the LENS and we CUT TO --
80.
JAKE WAKING UP in the Link. DARK as a coffin. He pushes the
lid off, letting in light, and lies there. He looks pale and
haggard, with a scraggly beard.
JAKE (V.O.)
Hard to believe it's only been three
months.
JAKE SITS in front of the video log camera, late at night. It
is many log entries later. He has lost a lot of weight. He
looks like a junkie watching a test pattern.
JAKE
(to the lens)
I can barely remember my old life. I'm
not sure who I am anymore.
CUT TO:
Under a sky of thunderheads, the forest is a dark wall beyond
the fence. SELFRIDGE, wearing an exopack, TEES UP while GRACE
and JAKE approach from the direction of the Ops Center.
SELFRIDGE
Good of you to stop by. How's it going
out there? Our blue friends all packed
up yet?
Selfridge swings his DRIVER with good form.
SELFRIDGE
See, I keep hooking it.
It's the damn
pack.
THE BALL drops into the mud just past a marker which reads
220. A TROOPER walks over to retrieve it.
SELFRIDGE
The low gravity and the high air density
cancel out so --
JAKE
You called us back to report -- you want
to hear it or not?
SELFRIDGE
Go ahead.
GRACE
Jake is making incredible progress, years
worth in just a few months. But -- we
need more time.
81.
SELFRIDGE
Not what I was hoping to hear.
It starts to rain. Selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from
his golf bag and snaps it open.
GRACE
Parker, it's their ancestral home.
They've lived there since before human
history began. You can spare them a few
more weeks.
SELFRIDGE
This thing is inevitable. What does it
matter when it happens? I'm sorry, Dr.
Augustine. You're out of time.
He leaves them standing there to get drenched.
CUT TO:
Strange horizontal LIGHTNING branches through the floating
mountains, twisted by the magnetic fields. The sky is black
and heavy with clouds.
JAKE and NEYTIRI run silhouetted in the night. Behind them
waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light. POLYPHEMUS
RISES behind the trees.
NEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water.
Jake follows her and --
UNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES.
They seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden
of waving shapes. Tiny purple fish swirl around them.
Their hands come together, fingers twining, as they float
weightlessly, as if between worlds.
DISSOLVE TO:
Laughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their
trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing
tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains.
Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their
footsteps with expanding rings of light.
It is an exquisitely beautiful spot.
The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up
her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her.
89.
NEYTIRI
This is a place for prayers to be heard.
And sometimes answered.
Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his
fingers, his palms, his forearms. His eyes go wide. We hear
the WHISPERING of ancient Na'vi VOICES.
JAKE
It's like -- a sound you feel.
NEYTIRI
We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of
Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who
live within Eywa.
A few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their
shoulders and arms.
They stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense,
almost luminous. He feels drawn into them.
But she pulls back a little.
NEYTIRI
You are Omaticaya now. You may make your
own bow from the wood of Hometree.
(she looks away)
And you may choose a woman.
The Amazon warrior trying so hard to sound casual.
Jake
suppresses a smile.
NEYTIRI
We have many fine women. Ninat is the
best singer --
JAKE
I don't want Ninat.
NEYTIRI
There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter --
Jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her.
JAKE
I've already chosen. But this woman must
also choose me.
She takes his hands and their fingers intertwine, moving
gently over each other.
90.
NEYTIRI
She already has.
He puts his face close to hers. She rubs her cheek against
his. He kisses her on the mouth. They explore each other.
Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling.
NEYTIRI
Kissing is very good. But we have
something better.
She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other
on the faintly glowing moss.
Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it. Jake does
the same, with trembling anticipation. The tendrils at the
ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined.
MACRO SHOT -- The tendrils INTERTWINE with gentle
undulations.
JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system
and hers. The ultimate intimacy.
They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of
moss, and ripples of light spread out around them.
THE WILLOWS sway, without wind, and the night is alive with
pulsing energy as we DISSOLVE TO --
LATER. She is collapsed across his chest.
Spent.
He
strokes her face tenderly.
JAKE
Neytiri, you know my real body is far
away, sleeping.
She raises up, placing her fingertips to his chest --
NEYTIRI
This body is real.
(she touches his forehead)
This spirit is real.
Her eyes are luminous, honest, infinitely deep.
NEYTIRI
When I was first your teacher, I hated
all Sky People. But you have also taught
me.
(WHISPERING)
Spirit is all that matters.
91.
She lays her head down, against his chest, listening to his
heartbeat.
NEYTIRI
I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for
life.
JAKE
We are?
NEYTIRI
Yes. It is our way.
(INNOCENTLY)
Oh. I forgot to tell?
He rouses up, making her look at him.
JAKE
Really, we are?
NEYTIRI
We are.
Jake considers this.
JAKE
It's cool. I'm there.
He lays his head down, and her arms enfold him, sheltering
him as he sleeps.
DAWN BREAKS in the sacred glade. Shafts of orange morning
light. Jake and Neytiri asleep in each others' arms. Maxfield
Parrish painting. But then --
THE ROAR OF ENGINES. Neytiri awakens with a start. The
SPLINTERING, CRACKLING of forest being crushed under enormous
treads gets louder.
SHE WATCHES in growing horror as the BLADE of a bulldozer
becomes a dark wall behind the sheltering ring of willows.
She shakes Jake, shouting at him in Na'vi to wake up.
92.
NEYTIRI
Jake! Wake up! Where ever you are, come
back to me now. Jake!
Neytiri SCREAMS as --
The willows begin to fall before the blade, to be ground
under the treads. AVATAR JAKE is directly in the path. She
tries to lift him, but he is too heavy. She is screaming at
him, frantically trying to wake him, as --
AVATAR JAKE wakes up to see --
NEYTIRI dragging him, screaming.
He leaps up as --
THE DOZER pushes inexorably into the glade, splintering the
trees, plowing the earth before it.
JAKE RUNS into the path of the bulldozer, waving his arms.
93.
JAKE
Hey!
Heeeey! Stop! Stop!
He positions himself where the camera-eyes of the robotic
juggernaut will see him.
JAKE grabs a rock and LEAPS onto the dozer.
He climbs
quickly to the CAMERA MAST.
SMASH! The rock crashes into the lens of the camera. Jake
beats the rock furiously against it, pounding it to junk.
THE JUGGERNAUT grinds to a stop. But the ROAR of engines
continues because --
MORE DOZERS and TRACTORS advance nearby, crushing the forest
before them. Trees are slashed down by the PLASMA CUTTERS.
Terrified animals flee before the onslaught.
POWERSUITS and TROOPERS stride through the ravaged forest,
blasting anything that moves. A trooper sees Jake on the
dozer. He rips off a BURST and --
Rounds CLANG into metal as Jake dives off the machine. He
grabs Neytiri and they run into concealing foliage. From
behind a screen of leaves, they watch as --
THE DOZERS advance, obliterating the sacred site, leaving
only mud and wood splinters in their path.
CU NEYTIRI, stunned by the nightmarish, unfathomable
wrongness of it. She sobs as the willows die.
QUARITCH rides left seat as Trudy pilots through the
mountains. She glances at him, then toggles the aircom.
TRUDY
Loveshack this is Samson One Six inbound
hot to your pos. I have Colonel Quaritch
with me and --
But Quaritch SLAMS the switch, cutting her off.
QUARITCH
Did I tell you to announce us?
TRUDY
Sorry sir, it's procedure.
TRUDY'S SAMSON lands. QUARITCH and a posse of troopers jump
down and rush the Shack.
SCORPION GUNSHIPS darken the sky as they come over the tops
of the trees. At the head of the formation is one much
larger ship, a monster 150 feet long -- the GENERAL DYNAMICS
C-21 DRAGON GUNSHIP.
Quaritch, next to the pilot of the Dragon, surveys the world
below like Napoleon astride his horse.
JAKE and GRACE are lashed to posts at the front entrance to
Hometree. The People look up as --
THE DRAGON and its escort of GUNSHIPS arrive over the trees.
The DOWN-BLAST from their rotors creates a maelstrom of
flying leaves and debris.
IN THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches a targeting screen --
a telescopic image of Jake and Grace tied to posts.
QUARITCH
Well, I'd say diplomacy has failed.
TSU'TEY and another HUNTER hold knives to the throats of the
two avatars, glaring defiantly at the gunships.
QUARITCH
I think they mean to cut their throats if
we don't back off. Make sure you get a
nice close-up of that. I can tack it onto
the after-action report.
JAKE YELLS to Neytiri, Tsu'tey, the others gathered nearby --
107.
JAKE
You have to get out of Hometree! Run to
the forest! Please, I'm begging you!
EYTUKAN scowls at Jake, then GRABS TSU'TEY and yells --
EYTUKAN
(SUBTITLED)
Take the ikran! Attack from above!
Tsu'tey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of Hometree.
IN THE COCKPIT Quaritch grows impatient.
QUARITCH
Alright, let's get this done. Give me
forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the
front door.
GUNNER
Roger.
CS forties. Going hot.
QUARITCH
Fire.
On the Dragon's stub-wings the 40mm ROCKET LAUNCHERS open up
with a BARRAGE of leaping fire which FLASHES down and --
K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM! -- the inside of Hometree ERUPTS
with multiple EXPLOSIONS of TEARGAS.
THE GAS rolls across the confused villagers. They begin to
cough and gag.
Eytukan and the remaining HUNTERS bravely fire at the
gunships with their longbows.
IN THE DRAGON'S COCKPIT, Quaritch laughs as arrows CLINK
against the armored windows.
AMID CLOUDS of teargas, the Omaticaya run, stumble, collapse.
EYTUKAN
(yelling/subtitled)
Everybody outside! Go to the Forest.
The villagers pour out of Hometree. Everyone is yelling.
Piercing SCREAMS in the boiling gas.
JAKE, eyes streaming, struggles with his bindings.
KA-WHOOM! An INCENDIARY ROUND explodes inside the Commons.
FLAMES ROAR through the base of Hometree.
108.
INSIDE HOMETREE it is a burning smoky HELL. Flames roar up
the inside like a chimney. STRAGGLERS scramble outside,
coughing and dragging wounded with them.
High up in the trunk, TSU'TEY and his hunters leap rapidly
from spoke to spoke, climbing barely ahead of the fireball.
OUTSIDE the fire is driven by the rotor-wash toward JAKE and
GRACE who are still bound tightly to the posts.
Out of the smoke, MO'AT appears in front of Jake.
She raises
a KNIFE and --
SLASHES DOWNWARD. Jake looks down, surprised, to see his
bonds falling away. He meets her eyes, which are filled with
horror, but also something else. Call it faith.
MO'AT
You are one of us.
Help us!
Jake takes the knife and cuts Grace free.
JAKE
We've gotta move!
He's gonna blow the
columns.
As Grace realizes what he means, he grabs her and they RUN.
Around them the Omaticaya flee in horror and confusion.
IN THE COCKPIT, Quaritch watches as the Omaticaya stream away
from the Great Tree, running along roots and branches.
QUARITCH
That's how you scatter the roaches. Okay,
switch missiles. Give me H-E's at the
base of the west columns.
PILOTS (V.O.)
Copy, switching missiles.
IN TRUDY'S SAMSON -- she hears the other pilots acknowledging
Quaritch's order.
TRUDY
Screw it.
She takes her finger OFF the fire-control and pulls her
aircraft out of formation.
PUSHING IN ON QUARITCH, the Hometree reflecting in his
glasses.
109.
QUARITCH
Bring it down.
MISSILES stream down from the DRAGON and the other gunships
and --
The base of Hometree VANISHES in a chain of HIGH-EXPLOSIVE
BLASTS. The massive PILLARS fragment into matchsticks, and --
The Omaticaya watch in horror as --
HOMETREE GROANS and starts to MOVE.
In a cacophony of cracking, splintering roots, the mighty
tree TOPPLES with agonizing slowness.
AT THE BANSHEE EYRIE, TSU'TEY and the other hunters spur
their mounts into flight. They swoop among the branches as
the tree, the one fixed thing in their lives, MOVES.
It CRASHES DOWN through the forest canopy, crushing the
lesser trees in its path, FALLING PONDEROUSLY.
HOMETREE hits the ground like the end of the world, raising a
great cloud of dust and pulverized debris.
IN THE DRAGON cockpit, Quaritch surveys the destruction.
QUARITCH
Nice work people. Alright, let's light
it up.
INCENDIARIES launch from the gunships, EXPLODING into gouts
of FIRE in the debris of Hometree.
THE GUNSHIPS fan the flames through the trees like a fire-
storm. The Omaticaya retreat as a WALL OF FIRE advances.
JAKE SEARCHES for Neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks.
JAKE
Neytiri!
Neytiri!
GRACE is gathering crying CHILDREN, and herding them away
from the fire-storm.
NEYTIRI stumbles through the burning wreckage at the edge of
the INFERNO. She sees --
EYTUKAN. A large shard of wood is driven through him like a
spear. He recognizes her as she kneels over him.
110.
EYTUKAN
(SUBTITLED)
Daughter -- take my bow. Protect the
People.
In his last living moment he places his bow in her hands.
She collapses over him, her face crumpling in grief.
JAKE reels out of the smoke.
Kneels next to her.
JAKE
I'm sorry --
She shoves him away and stands, screaming at him as tears
stream down her face.
NEYTIRI
Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never
come back!
Jake stumbles back as she slumps down by her father's body.
Sparks and smoke swirl around him. He watches as --
NETYIRI kneels, grieving. Slumped over, clutching her
stomach. Keening like an animal.
SLOW MOTION -- Jake staggers lost and alone through the
burning forest. Utterly shattered. Eyes vacant.
JAKE (V.O.)
I was a warrior who dreamed he could
bring peace. Sooner or later though, you
always have to wake up...
The strings are cut. Jake flops to the ground, limp.
Elsewhere in the smoky Hell, Grace slumps unconscious. The
crying kids pull at her. Mo'at, leading a group of
Omaticaya, comes upon the scene.
111.
She grabs the kids and pulls them away, leaving Grace's
avatar helpless in the path of the flames. She hesitates,
then --
MO'AT
(SUBTITLED)
Bring her.
ON A HILLSIDE -- a grieving Neytiri stands with Mo'at and the
Omaticaya refugees. Two hunters pull Grace's avatar on a
travois.
They watch as the flames burn like a funeral pyre below. A
great pall of smoke darkens the landscape.
DISSOLVE TO:
IN THE SAMSON, Norm is helping Trudy race through the
preflight checks as the turbines spool up. A LIGHT hits
them.
An armored TROOPER approaches, aiming his AR at them.
TROOPER
I need you to shut down and step out of
the vehicle! Now!
JAKE rolls up behind him, aiming his pistol.
JAKE
Take it nice and easy, troop.
The trooper turns, sees the gun.
JAKE
On the ground, face down. Hands behind
your head.
The trooper hesitates.
GRACE
Do what he goddamn says!
He does. Norm jumps down and grabs the trooper's rifle and
side-arm, covering him, while Grace helps Jake from chair to
the back bay of the chopper. She throws his chair in, and
jumps in herself.
JAKE
Go! Go! Go!
114.
HOLDING HIS BREATH Quaritch yanks the hatch open and strides
onto the outer landing. Inside people scramble for MASKS.
THE SAMSON lifts off in a blast of rotor-wash just as --
QUARITCH OPENS FIRE and --
ROUNDS rake the ship. Trudy banks hard, using the bottom to
shield them. Bullets WHACK into the ship as she climbs-out
over the tree-line.
Jake's fist pumps the air exultantly.
JAKE
Oh yeah, baby!
GRACE
Aaahh, crap. Not again.
He looks over at Grace and freezes. She is looking down at a
BLOODY HAND. She clutches her abdomen, covering the
spreading stain. Looks at Jake, wide-eyed.
GRACE
This is gonna ruin my whole day.
JAKE
Hang on, Grace.
CUT TO:
NORM'S AVATAR, with an AR slung over his shoulder, stands on
the roof of the LINK MODULE. He gives a thumbs up signal.
The lift cable goes taut and --
The shack LIFTS OFF THE GROUND.
Trudy's Samson beats the grass of the mountain meadow,
straining to lift the module on a long-line sling. The shack
sways as Trudy banks across forested slopes and heads deeper
into the HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS.
115.
Dawn light paints the massive ARCHES of magnetic rock above
the Well of Souls.
Tiny as an insect, the SAMSON passes.
116.
JAKE (V.O.)
The Well of Souls. The heart of the
forest. I knew the People would go
there.
The WELL OF SOULS is a deep caldera 100 meters across. It is
ringed with enormous WILLOWS whose roots seem to pour down
the sheer rock walls like candle wax.
AT THE BOTTOM, in a natural amphitheater, the Omaticaya
refugees are clustered around a central rock outcropping
which forms a kind of dais and altar.
Shafts of dawn light reach to the bottom of the grotto,
lighting a single willow -- the MOTHER TREE. Ancient and
gnarled, it grows in the center of the rock.
Its ROOTS spread down to the grotto floor, where they merge
with the roots of the willows ringing the Well -- forming a
braided mat resembling the surface of a brain.
Mo'at stands on the dais, leading them in a CHANT.
MO'AT
(SUBTITLED)
Wise ancestors who live within Eywa,
guide us. Give us a sign.
CUT TO:
- DAWN
The shack descends from the sky like a gift from the gods.
It bumps to the ground.
CUT TO:
CU JAKE'S AVATAR -- HIS EYES OPEN. He sits up. The forest is
silent, shrouded in smoke that the sun can't penetrate. The
animals have fled. Ash blows on the wind.
JAKE (V.O.)
Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face
them again, I was gonna have to change
the rules.
DISSOLVE -- JAKE reaches the top of a rise. The forest
beyond is utterly DEVASTATED. The trees burned and fallen.
Small fires still flicker across a landscape in Hell.
JAKE stares. It is his vision, made real. He stumbles
through the dark wasteland, sparks and ash swirling around
him.
A SCREECH.
Jake looks up as --
HIS BANSHEE -- bonded for life -- flaps down to a landing in
front of him. He steps to it, and strokes its head. It
nudges his chest like a horse.
JAKE (V.O.)
Sometimes your whole life boils down to
one insane move.
JAKE
Come on, boy. Time to fly.
OMIITED
THE GREAT LEONOPTERYX glides effortlessly along the ridge
where Jake and Neytiri first encountered him.
It scans for prey below, its magnificent indigo-crested head
cocking left, then right.
JAKE (V.O.)
The way I had it figured, Toruk is the
baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks
him. So why would he ever look up?
FROM ABOVE -- THE SMALL SHADOW of Jake's banshee falls across
the back of the mighty Toruk.
118.
JAKE (V.O.)
But that was just a theory.
JAKE DIVES and WE RUSH DOWN toward the great beast and our
own shadow then --
CUT TO:
The Omaticaya people lift their voices in a SONG filled with
tragic loss and yearning for deliverance.
CLOSE ON NEYTIRI, singing. A SHADOW CROSSES HER FACE.
She
looks up, and her eyes go wide as --
A TERRIBLE CRY echoes, turning all eyes skyward.
AN ENORMOUS
SHADOW covers the crowd as --
TORUK comes out of the sun, beating its huge wings to slow
its descent. Its crimson and black wings, backlit by the
sun, seem to glow from within.
The People CRY OUT in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast
alights in their midst. And that's when they see --
JAKE, riding high on its shoulders, plugged-in to its
antenna. It folds its wings and stands calmly amid the
paralyzed Na'vi.
Toruk lowers its body. They stare in awe as Jake dismounts
and strokes the magnificent animal's flank.
NEYTIRI, TSU'TEY and MO'AT watch in stunned amazement as the
legendary Rider of Last Shadow walks toward them.
NEYTIRI
(breathing the words)
Toruk Macto.
Neytiri raises her arms.
NEYTIRI
(SHOUTING)
Toruk Macto!
ON THE FACES of the Omaticaya -- new hope dawning in their
eyes. WHISPERS flow among them, the words REPEATED --
CROWD
Toruk Macto... Toruk Macto...
119.
Jake walks through the crowd, straight to Neytiri at the foot
of the dais. He looks into her enormous eyes, and the
emotion between them is powerful and pure.
NEYTIRI
I See you.
JAKE
(a hoarse whisper)
I See you.
Neytiri's eyes brim with tears.
NEYTIRI
I was afraid Jake -- for my people. I'm
not any more.
Jake takes Neytiri's hand and climbs the steps of the dais.
MO'AT steps back in awe as he approaches. He turns to
Tsu'tey, who stares at him with fear and incomprehension.
Jake plays to the rapt crowd as he says --
JAKE
(SUBTITLED)
Tsu'tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I
stand before you, ready to serve the
People.
(then just for Tsu'tey)
You are Olo'eyctan, and you are the best
warrior. I can't do this without you.
Tsu'tey struggles with his emotions. Finally --
TSU'TEY
I will fly with you.
JAKE
Ireiyo.
JAKE turns to the MATRIARCH.
JAKE
Grace is dying.
I beg the help of the
Great Mother.
MO'AT
Bring her, Jakesully.
TIME CUT -- AVATAR JAKE carries Grace's HUMAN BODY, lightly
in his arms like a child. Jake walks through the crowd to
the dais, followed by NORM, who carries GRACE'S AVATAR.
120.
JAKE
Look where we are, Grace.
Her eyes flutter open. She looks up wonderingly at the Mother
Tree.
GRACE
(with a wan smile)
I need to take some samples.
Mo'at directs them to lay both bodies among the roots on the
altar-rock.
Mo'at touches Jake's shoulder and he steps back.
MO'AT
(QUIETLY)
The Great Mother may choose to save all
that she is --
Mo'at's hand indicates Grace's AVATAR --
MO'AT
-- in this body.
CU JAKE, realizing the enormity of what she's saying.
JAKE
Is that possible?
MO'AT
Possible, yes. She must pass through the
Eye of Eywa -- and return. But Jakesully--
she is very weak.
Jake kneels next to Grace, taking her tiny human hand in his
avatar hand.
JAKE
Hang on, they're gonna fix you up.
Grace is barely conscious.
She grips his hand.
GRACE
I -- always held back. But you gave them
your heart. I'm proud of you, Jake.
Jake feels his throat close with emotion.
Grace's eyes blaze with intensity though her voice is faint.
121.
GRACE
Help them.
You do whatever it takes. You
hear me?
JAKE
I will.
TIME CUT -- MO'AT stands in a kind of trance amongst the
tendrils of the Mother Tree.
NEYTIRI and the other acolytes dance hypnotically. All the
Omaticaya sway and chant to the rhythm of the drums.
MACRO SHOT -- fine, hairlike THREADS have emerged from the
roots and are gently spreading over Grace's HUMAN skin.
JAKE, still holding her hand, watches her body being fused to
the root-floor by a thousand connections.
GRACE'S AVATAR is gently connected by the same questing ROOT-
CILIA-- they entwine with the QUEUE and spread over the body.
The grotto is dark except for the spectral GLOW of the
willows. The CHANT continues, hypnotically. MO'AT, on her
knees beneath the Mother Tree, writhes her arms in the trance
state. Her eyes are rolled back, showing only WHITE.
GRACE GASPS and her eyes SNAP OPEN. Her expression is AMAZED,
as if seeing something so beautiful it can never be
explained.
ON HER HAND -- GRIPPING Jake's convulsively, as she tries to
anchor herself to this world for a few more seconds --
GRACE
I'm with her Jake --
(an amazed whisper)
-- she's real --
Grace SHUDDERS, as pain shoots through her. BLOOD seeps
through the silken white root-cilia growing across her
abdomen. Drowning WHITE in shocking CRIMSON.
She exhales a last shuddering breath -- and goes STILL.
JAKE
Grace!
He sees the roots falling away from her human body.
JAKE TURNS hopefully toward her AVATAR -- but the roots are
falling away from it as well. It sleeps -- VACANT.
122.
MO'AT stops the chant. She crosses to Jake and kneels with
him, touching his shoulder.
MO'AT
Her wounds were too great, there was not
enough time. She is with Eywa now.
NEYTIRI removes Grace's mask and gently closes her eyes.
Jake stands slowly, barely holding it together.
NEYTIRI comes to him and he sees the despair and hope
conflicting on her face --
-- and he raises his head.
TURNS to face TSU'TEY and the
CROWD.
JAKE
With your permission, I will Speak now.
You would honor me by translating.
Tsu'tey gestures assent, and they face the clan together.
JAKE SPEAKS, the pain of Grace's death in the passion and
fury of his voice. Tsu'tey TRANSLATES beside him.
JAKE
The Sky People have sent a message that
they can take whatever they want, and no
one can stop them. But we will send them
a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind
can carry you, tell the other clans to
come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to
them. Fly now with me brothers and
sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky
People that this is our land!
TSU'TEY finishes with a bloodcurdling war-cry, and the entire
CLAN responds, their shouts echoing across the forest.
JAKE takes Neytiri's hand and runs to the leonopteryx.
He
vaults onto its back and pulls her up behind him.
THE HUNTERS run to their banshees, mounting quickly. Jake's
leonopteryx rises on mighty wings into the night sky. With a
thunder of wings, the banshees take off after it.
LONG LENS -- POLYPHEMUS. Across its face, the banshees rise
like a swarm of bats. Groups of riders peel off in different
directions.
CUT TO:
123.
JAKE and NEYTIRI stand before the gathered members of ANOTHER
CLAN. Jake speaks as she translates. We don't hear the
words.
TRACK ACROSS the faces of the clan, a sea of eyes in
flickering fire-light.
JAKE (V.O.)
We rode out to the four winds. To the
horse clans of the plain, to the ikran
people of the mountains. When Toruk
Macto called them, they came.
VARIOUS ANGLES -- SLOW MOTION as riders vault onto their
armored direhorses. Banshee riders raise spears and bows,
spurring their mounts to leap skyward.
CUT TO:
With a WHOOSH and the crack of mighty wings, JAKE RETURNS.
Jake and Neytiri alight from his legendary mount.
Around them HUNDREDS OF BANSHEES are landing.
A gathering of
eagles.
FROM ABOVE we can see hundreds of Na'vi streaming down into
the Well of Souls and many hundreds more camped in the forest
above it.
DIREHORSE RIDERS are arriving along many trails.
BANSHEE RIDERS circle and swoop, darkening the sky above the
grotto.
JAKE, standing next to the Leonopteryx, watches his army
gathering.
CUT TO:
TRACKING through the warrior camp above the Well of Souls.
Hundreds of hunters from many clans prepare their weapons.
Hunters paint the wings of their banshees like war ponies.
DIREHORSES are painted and ornamented with totemic streamers.
The Na'vi paint and pierce themselves. Dance. Bathe in the
smoke of cleansing herbs -- RITUAL PURIFICATION. HUGE DRUMS
are beaten. A dark primeval energy. They are psyching
themselves up for battle.
JAKE (V.O.)
I was a warrior who dreamed he could
bring peace. But there was only one
thing I was ever really good at. Ooh-rah.
TIME CUT -- Jake, Neytiri a group of banshee riders squat
around an animal skin on which he has drawn the silhouette of
a Scorpion gunship -- like a hunt totem.
JAKE
(Na'vi/subtitled)
Strike here and here.
Jake splats red dye at the centers of the circles symbolizing
the rotors. The Na'vi absorb the lesson eagerly, like kids.
He sees TRUDY approaching and breaks off. Neytiri stays with
the hunters, talking about what they've learned.
TRUDY
(LOW)
You know our chances suck.
JAKE
Yeah.
TRUDY
Going up against gunships with bows and
arrows...
JAKE
What's your point?
128.
TRUDY
(NODDING)
Right.
She taps his fist and walks away toward her SAMSON.
CUT TO:
The cook-fires of the battle camp FLICKER like a
constellation around the edge of the Well of Souls as --
JAKE slips down into the darkened, empty amphitheater.
He moves to the MOTHER TREE -- gnarled, ancient, MAJESTIC.
The roots spread in all directions, like the center of the
world.
Jake steps forward. The willow-like tendrils SWAY toward
him, moving in a breeze that isn't there.
JAKE
I've never done this in my life.
He squats at the base of the tree.
JAKE
And I'm probably just talking to a tree
right now. But if you're there -- I need
to give you a heads up.
He looks up into the tree. The hanging tendrils undulate
softly. It's easy to imagine a presence.
JAKE
If Grace is there with you -- look in her
memories -- she can show you the world we
come from. There's no green there. They
killed their Mother, and they're gonna do
the same thing here.
FROM UP IN THE TREE, looking down.
WOODSPRITES float in
silence, moving around aimlessly.
JAKE
More Sky People are gonna come. They're
gonna come like a rain that never ends --
Neytiri approaches silently behind him, listening.
JAKE
-- until they've covered the world.
Unless we stop them.
(MORE)
129.
JAKE (cont'd)
Look, you chose me for somethin'. And
I'll stand and fight, you know I will.
But I could use a little help here.
Jake senses Neytiri and turns.
NEYTIRI
Our Great Mother does not take sides.
She protects only the balance of life.
She comes to him, intertwining her long fingers with his.
JAKE
It was worth a try.
They lean in, foreheads touching, bodies pressed together.
Holding each other -- in this, the last moment of peace.
CUT TO:
TIGHT ON a turbine as it starts to turn. Its RISING WHINE
carries over --
A SERIES OF RHYTHMIC CUTS:
MAGAZINES are slammed into automatic weapons. AMMO BELTS are
fed into rotary cannons. MISSILES are attached to gunship
stub-wings.
TIGHT ON BLUE HANDS sharpening wooden arrows.
Stringing
bows. Cinching direhorse harnesses.
TROOPERS DROP into ampsuit cockpits. PILOTS close gunship
canopies. TROOPERS run up shuttle ramps.
LONG LENS STACK, tight and abstract on gunships as they rise
in a swarm amid boiling turbine exhaust and blasting rotor
wash.
WIDE SHOT -- TILTROTORS fill the sky. Deadly armored beetles.
The DRAGON leads the formation, flanked by SCORPIONS. Behind
that is a wave of SAMSONS, and last, the two enormous
VALKYRIE shuttles, packed with troops and ampsuits.
INSIDE THE DRAGON, Quaritch surveys his armada as they skim
over the tree tops.
THEY SWEEP toward the Hallelujah mountains in a thundering
wave.
130.
SQUADRONS OF BANSHEES darken the sky in waves, led by a
single GREAT LEONOPTERYX. Jake sits astride his mount,
flanked by Neytiri and Tsu'tey on their banshees.
THE DRAGON DESCENDS on final approach to a large clearing --
the LZ. The Samsons flair and touch down, disgorging troops,
while the gunships hover protectively.
THE VALKYRIES blast the ground with their powerful lift jets.
They land. The ramps drop. Troopers pour out, weapons
leveled, advancing in a cordon.
UP ANGLE as AMPSUITS descend from the Dragon on cables.
Their massive feet smash down, and they march forward,
leading the army into the forest.
LYLE WAINFLEET, walking point in his hydraulic suit, scans
his cockpit screens. He sees movement on the FLIR display --
ghostly THERMAL SIGNATURES.
WAINFLEET
Contact. Two hundred meters.
A chilling SOUND echoes through the forest -- the ululating
WAR CRIES of untold Na'vi. The troopers, look around,
spooked. They can't tell where the sound is coming from.
Then they feel it -- the GROUND ITSELF SHAKING.
They grip
their weapons, bracing themselves as --
THREE HUNDRED NA'VI HORSEMEN charge through the forest at a
full gallop, their hooves POUNDING the earth. It is an
awesome sight.
NORM SPELLMAN rides with the Na'vi hunters, carrying an
assault rifle.
THE NA'VI CHARGE thunders toward the human line.
The hunters
raise their bows as --
THE AMPSUITS raise their GAU-90's.
ON THE THERMAL IMAGERS target-cursors track the ghost riders.
QUARITCH
Fire for effect.
The entire line of troopers opens fire. TRACERS riddle the
jungle, blasting foliage into confetti.
131.
CHARGING DIREHORSES crash down, flipping over. Riders are
flung off. The withering fire continues, and the ranks are
decimated as --
RIDERS LAUNCH their arrows at a full gallop. A few hit their
marks among the troopers. NORM FIRES his AR on full auto.
TWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them
like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit,
FLIPPING IT onto its back with a blown-out canopy. Victory
is short lived as the two riders are cut down.
NORM'S HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the
creature cartwheels. He hits hard, scrambling for cover as --
A WARRIOR HURLS his spear a moment before his horse is cut
down. It SLAMS through an ampsuit's canopy but --
THE MERCILESS FIRE continues. Horses rear and collapse.
Riders pivot their mounts to flee and --
THE THERMAL SCREENS show the remaining ghost riders
scattering.
LYLE signals and the line advances, firing sporadically at
moving targets.
OVERHEAD, NA'VI HUNTERS stream through the trees, running
along the branches.
As the troopers advance into bow range, the NA'VI open fire
and --
TROOPERS SPROUT ARROWS in throat, legs, masks -- the targets
Jake taught them, but --
THE FIRING LINE aims upward, tracking the THERMAL TARGETS.
TRACERS rip through the foliage and --
NA'VI FALL while others retreat as bark and wood is blasted
off the limbs beneath their feet.
NORM sprints frantically through the woods, shouting into his
HANDSET --
NORM
Jake!
Jake! We're falling back!
SURVIVING NA'VI flee the horrific onslaught.
It is a total
rout.
IN THE DRAGON, Quaritch catches glimpses of the figures
streaming through the forest below.
132.
QUARITCH
Blue team, switch forties.
Fire at will.
Led by the Dragon, the gunships FIRE streamers of 40mm
ROCKETS ahead of them. The jungle EXPLODES with HE bursts.
Circular SHOCK WAVES flash outward through the jungle --
STROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Na'vi
leaping, as the jungle rocks with the concussive onslaught.
HUNTERS LOOK UP as a dark shape hovers overhead. The
downblast of the VALKYRIE'S lift jets shreds the forest.
INSIDE THE SHUTTLE'S cargo bay, a row of DAISYCUTTERS are
lined up. Troopers roll the first pallet down the ramp.
THE PALLET falls into the jungle below and --
BA-WHOOOOOM! -- an enormous high-explosive blast rips a huge
hole in the forest. A white concussion wave flashes out
across the ground for hundreds of meters in all directions.
AT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Na'vi are
blasted out of existence by fire and shock waves.
IN THE CARGO BAY the troopers WHOOP and high-five.
TROOPERS
Yeah baby!
Get some!
GROUND TROOPS ADVANCE, firing flamethrowers, AR's and GAU-
90's.
Quaritch's fleet flies into the shadow of the Mountain of
Truth.
QUARITCH
Blue team, stay with the ground units.
Red team, with me. We're punching for
the main target.
Quaritch glances up to see --
A squadron of WINGED SHAPES, diving out of the morning glare
like birds of prey.
CLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as
he leads the charge and --
SCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like
falcons hitting fat turkeys. The air battle is joined.
133.
JAKE'S GREAT LEONOPTERYX flairs into its signature crimson X
shape just before --
K-WHAM!! -- it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around
the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE
can barely hang onto the gyrating creature.
The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into
his canopy.
Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a
CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees.
There is a satisfying FIREBALL.
SCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee
riders, FIRING cannons and rockets.
JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with
cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion.
JAKE tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds
splitting the air around him and --
The Scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as
they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive
down into the trees.
DOOR GUNNERS in a SAMSON are shooting down banshees like
Messerschmidts from a B-17 as --
WE FOLLOW TSU'TEY'S BANSHEE in a full delta dive. He swoops
in from its blind spot and --
THE GUNNERS SWIVEL too late as Tsu'tey flashes past them,
SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy.
A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-to-
air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION.
WIDE SHOT as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and
dive, like the Battle of Britain. Banshees are hit by guns
and missiles, falling out of the sky. The occasional trail of
smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt-rotor.
IN THE CENTER the Dragon is pouring out hellacious fire --
tracer rounds from multiple turrets and missiles from the
stub-wing pods.
NEYTIRI BANKS hard as TRACERS flash past her.
A Scorpion is
right on her ass as --
SHE ROLLS inverted and dives under the edge of Mons
Veritatis, then rolls out, zig-zagging through the dangling
vines but --
134.
THE GUNSHIP stays on her. It rips through the vines, and
tracers FLASH toward us as --
SHE JINKS the banshee around a thundering waterfall but --
HER PURSUER explodes right through the curtain of water. It
launches an air-to-air missile. NEYTIRI jinks hard, diving.
The missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the
shock wave.
THE GUNSHIP follows her through a narrow slit between Mons
Veritatis and a smaller floating island. They run this slot
rolled up on their sides and --
THE SCORPION GUNNER locks up Neytiri for a missile shot but --
A SHADOW crosses his canopy. Out of the sun comes a crimson
demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and --
K-WHAMMM!! The leonopteryx SLAMS the gunship, driving it
downward in a dive. The leonopteryx lashes at it with claws
and teeth as they fall together out of control.
Jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick,
breaking its back on a rocky promontory and EXPLODING.
FLYING WITH A SAMSON as a SECOND SAMSON falls in beside it.
This one has its pilot door off, and the PILOT is wearing a
breathing mask. The door gunners wave at --
TRUDY, her expression grim behind her mask. She holds the
cyclic stick between her knees while she RAKES the other ship
with BURSTS from an AR in her lap.
The pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control.
TRUDY
You're not the only ones with guns, you
pricks.
NEYTIRI JINKS her banshee hard, an enemy Samson right behind
her. The pilot is a hotdog, following her down into the
trees, under the canopy.
They slalom among the trunks at high speed. The gunners hang
half out the doors, firing. Bark and leaves explode around
Neytiri as she zig-zags through the jungle.
THE BANSHEE dives under a huge tree limb, and the pilot
follows. He looks up at the last second, catching a glimpse
of blue-skinned figures.
THE HUNTERS drop a net of woven vines behind Neytiri and --
135.
The SAMSON hits it hard. The net fouls the ship, FLIPPING IT
backwards. It crashes upside down to the forest floor.
KABOOM!!
NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE is hit by GROUND-FIRE. It folds up like a
broken kite, crashing down through branches and --
SHE SLAMS into the ground, stunned.
IN THE DRAGON Quaritch looks ahead, seeing the WELL OF SOULS.
He taps the pilot and points --
QUARITCH
There it is.
(into his headset)
Valkyrie One, this is Dragon. Target is
in sight.
IN THE CARGO BAY of Valkyrie One, the troopers ready their
deadly loads.
TROOPER
Target in sight.
CIRCLING ABOVE, Tsu'tey falls in beside Jake, who talks to
him by AIRCOM HEADSET.
JAKE
We have to stop the shuttles, no matter
what it takes.
TSU'TEY nods. He signals, gathering other hunters, who fall
in with him as he dives. Jake rolls in after them but --
A GUNSHIP drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as --
TSU'TEY LEADS the attack on the first shuttle. Hunters jink
and weave through WITHERING FIRE from the escort ships.
GUNNERS with jerry-rigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of
the shuttles, picking off banshees who get past the escort.
TSU'TEY is RAKED by a burst from the dorsal gunners. His
mount crumples, plummeting with a dying scream and --
WE SPIRAL DOWN with him, the forest rushing up and --
A BLINDING BLIZZARD of green as he tears downward, catching
at leaves and vines. He SLAMS to the ground, badly injured.
NEARBY, ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest
floor, firing their cannons and flamethrowers. The GAU-90s
rip the forest to shreds.
136.
Norm, firing as he retreats, is HIT. He collapses, his avatar
body mortally wounded as --
HYDRAULIC FEET approach, passing the bodies of direhorses and
Na'vi hunters. Norm painfully tries to load another
magazine, panting in fear and pain as --
AN AMPSUIT stomps up.
Aims its cannon point blank. B-BLAM!
TSU'TEY lies gasping, mortally injured. He looks up,
grimacing, as an ampsuit looms over him.
LYLE WAINFLEET reaches down and grabs Tsu'tey by his queue,
lifting him painfully.
WAINFLEET
I hear this is worse than death for you,
chief.
WAINFLEET cuts Tsu'tey's queue off near the base. TSU'TEY
SCREAMS in agony, his nervous system exploding on overload.
Grinning, Lyle holds up the queue -- Tsu'tey's only
connection to the world-consciousness which is his life.
NEYTIRI -- bleeding, bruised -- staggers amid burning
wreckage. AMPSUIT footsteps approach and she crouches behind
a tree. Troopers are seconds from seeing her as --
NEYTIRI knocks an arrow to HER FATHER'S BOW, and readies
herself for a last kamikaze shot when --
THE TROOPER on the far right of the firing line sees
something on his screens.
TROOPER
Right flank -- something's coming!
It's
all lit up out there.
The troopers become aware of the GROUND SHAKING. A slow
building thunderous ROAR and --
AN AMPSUIT comes FLYING out of the trees, cartwheeling past
them, and the SHAKING BUILDS --
137.
Mo'at opens her eyes in sudden realization as --
The troopers pivot to face --
A WALL OF CHARGING HAMMERHEADS CRASHING out of the foliage in
a shower of broken branches as --
THE TROOPERS open fire but -- the stampede drives over them
like a wave. Tree-trunk feet shatter the ampsuit cockpits.
Troopers are crushed or asphyxiated.
NEARBY the foot-soldiers see LIVING SHADOWS flow out of the
gloom as --
VIPERWOLVES race among them with flashing jaws. The troopers
FIRE wildly as they go down, hitting each other as much as
their attackers.
The survivors break and run as more viperwolves bound out of
the shadows.
JAKE BANKS, watching as HUNDREDS of rider-less WILD BANSHEES
converge on Quaritch's ships. They literally darken the sky.
JAKE
What the hell -- ?
The wild banshees wheel among the ships, ripping into them.
ON JAKE -- slowly getting it.
EYWA is in the fight.
JAKE
WHOO-HOOOO!
A GUNNER fires from the door of a Samson. There is a CRASH
and the head of a BANSHEE lunges in the open door, jerking
him out. Other banshees tear at the pilot's windshield.
NEYTIRI watches in awe as the ground troops scatter in
disarray. The viperwolves flash past her, ignoring her.
She senses something and turns slowly to see --
A THANATOR emerging from the smoke behind her. A glistening
black demon. She stands paralyzed before its stygian gaze--
-- and the thanator lowers itself, until its head is just
above the ground. It holds that position -- waiting.
138.
Trembling, she approaches the waiting demon.
A smoky hell. Fires burn all around. The troopers are
disorganized, falling back. Shooting at shadows. Panicked
yelling fills the comm freq.
WAINFLEET and another AMPSUIT are charging together through
the smoky gloom.
WAINFLEET
A and C squads -- rally at my pos.
I
want --
(screaming on the comm)
Who's screaming God damn it?!
TROOPER (ON RADIO)
We gotta get outta here! Whoever's in
charge, call for extraction!
WAINFLEET
Shutup you crybabies!
SOMETHING slams into the other `suit, tackling it OUT OF
FRAME. Wainfleet whirls to see his squad-mate missing. He
moves through a screen of foliage to reveal --
The AMPSUIT -- ripped open. Driver gone. Blood inside the
cockpit. He WHIRLS at a sound in time to see --
A THANATOR LEAPING straight at him -- WAINFLEET raises his
cannon but--
WHAM!! It's on him, slamming him to the ground. The cannon
goes flying. He's face to face with its nightmare jaws,
right outside his canopy--
On its back is NEYTIRI, and it's a toss up which one looks
more pissed off. The thanator rears back, muscles rippling
as it poises to strike and --
K-KRAAACKK! Slams its teeth right through his canopy.
Wainfleet's SCREAM is brief.
Neytiri's demon mount rears up and its triumphant ROAR echoes
through the forest.
HUMAN NORM emerges from the airlock, wearing breathing gear
and carrying an AR. He stumbles, dazed, toward the battle.
JAKE SIGNALS and a formation of hunters rolls in, diving at
the lead shuttle, which is already besieged by winged
creatures.
THE CARGO RAMP is the scene of a pitched battle. Na'vi
hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves,
overwhelming the troopers.
HUNTERS are shot, falling out of the ship, as others fly in.
They shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp, and
troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage.
The panicked CREW CHIEF slams a switch and the ramp begins to
close, a second before he is cut down by a spear.
JAKE'S LEONOPTERYX plummets at the shuttle from behind. He
swoops down, flairs to reduce speed, rolls off his mount and
lands, tumbling on the shuttle's broad back as --
GUNNERS try to swing their guns toward him but he RAKES them
with his AR, still running forward and --
JAKE PULLS two grenades from his battle harness, yanking the
pins out with his teeth. He hurls them down the intakes of
the VTOL turbofans as --
HIS LEONOPTERYX BANKS in a tight arc back toward him and --
140.
HE SPRINTS ON as the grenades EXPLODE, shattering the
turbines, which riddle the fuselage with shrapnel and --
JAKE LEAPS INTO SPACE, landing on the back of his mount and
reconnecting. They flap away, gaining altitude as fire
BLASTS out of the bottom of the shuttle.
ON THE FLIGHT DECK, the pilot feels the ship dropping.
PILOT
Mains to a hundred percent!
Get me
airspeed!
The pilot and copilot slam the throttle levers forward and --
The FUSION ENGINES BLAZE, thrusting the shuttle forward.
It
still falls, its remaining lift fans screaming, until --
IT'S CLIPPING the tree tops when it gets enough translational
lift to fly and --
THE PILOT PULLS back on the stick, lifting the nose.
PILOT
We're good!
BEHIND HIM, a surviving Na'vi hunter runs forward and --
THOONK!
ARROWHEADS sprout from the pilots' necks and chests.
THE SHUTTLE CLIMBS out of control, at full acceleration. It
SLAMS into the underside of MONS Veritatis. It EXPLODES, and
hundreds of tons of flaming debris drop back into the forest.
ON THE FLIGHT DECK of the other SHUTTLE, the pilots watch the
wreckage falling.
PILOT
Valkyrie Two is breaking off. And if any
of ya'll want to get off this piece of
shit planet, you better cover our ass,
`cause we're the only way back to orbit.
GUNSHIP PILOT
Roger that.
FROM THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches the shuttle bank
away, with most of the remaining gunships following.
QUARITCH
Get back here you worthless pukes!
141.
PILOT
Are we breaking off?
Quaritch draws his pistol.
QUARITCH
What do you think?
He is over the edge-- no logic in his brain now.
Only death.
Regular troopers and volunteers FLEE through the jungle,
scrambling to board SAMSONS as they touch down.
Mo'at LOOKS UP as the DRAGON appears over the trees like the
shadow of Death. Around her, the Na'vi mothers clutch their
children to them. We see AKWEY'S BOY among them.
JAKE'S LEONOPTERYX drops toward the Dragon like a Mig 29.
He
pulls out, skimming over the ship. Uncoupling, he rolls
backward off his mount and --
JAKE HITS, skidding, on the hull of the Dragon. He rolls to
his feet, already running as --
QUARITCH sees the leonopteryx WHOOSH overhead and flap away
with no rider. He snap-looks aft to see --
JAKE SPRINTING along the spine of the ship, yanking two
grenades from his battle-harness, pulling the pins with his
teeth, then --
QUARITCH's hand shoots out and SLAMS the pilot's CYCLIC STICK
hard over. THE DRAGON lurches sideways, rolling sharply with
a ROAR of protesting rotors and --
JAKE IS FLUNG off his feet. The grenades miss the TURBINE
INTAKES. One bounces off the ship. The other lodges against
a cowling and --
JAKE SLIDES OFF the ship, falling as -- K-BLAM! The grenade
blows a two meter hole in the hull --
WHOOOSHH!
Pandoran air swirls inside.
QUARITCH
(to the pilot)
Put your mask on.
Quaritch leaps out of his seat, heading aft as --
JAKE GRABS the edge of a weapons pod, his feet dangling over
open space.
HOLDING HIS BREATH, Quaritch blows a RESCUE HATCH and leans
outside. Jake sees him aim his massive PISTOL.
K-WHAM! K-WHAM! Rounds clang next to Jake's head. He LETS GO,
plummeting into the trees --
Jake plunges through jungle canopy. He catches a HUGE LEAF,
as Neytiri taught him -- it bends down, breaking his fall --
143.
HE LETS GO, dropping again only to catch ANOTHER LEAF, and
then another, and --
WE RUSH DOWN with him through this green blur.
Jake drops to
the ground in a feral crouch. Unhurt.
JAKE
(into his headset)
Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of
Souls! He's got a clear shot. Hit him,
anybody that can! Do it now!
IN HER SAMSON Trudy Chacon is all business.
TRUDY
On it.
SHE BANKS hard, pulling g's, coming around on the Dragon.
She pours on the coal and the Samson leaps forward, straight
at the WARSHIP.
QUARITCH, DRILLS a stream of tracers at her, tearing through
her canopy, ripping chunks off her fuselage.
IN THE JUNGLE BELOW, Norm watches her kamikaze run --
NORM
No!
TRUDY
(clipped, pilot-like)
Norm, I love you.
TRUDY DIVES, raking through treetops and then, at the last
instant, YANKS BACK on the stick and --
THE SAMSON leaps straight up and -- K-KRASH!! SHEARS OFF THE
COCKPIT of the Dragon as --
QUARITCH THROWS HIMSELF aft along the aisle and --
TRUDY'S SAMSON disintegrates, the wreckage burning as it
tumbles into the jungle.
MILES QUARITCH grips the bulkhead as he stares out the open
front of the fuselage. Wind howls through wreckage where the
pilot used to be. The forest rushes up to meet him and --
THE DRAGON CRASHES through splintering trees, IMPACTING in a
lake with a WHITE BLAST of water.
144.
Norm takes a few steps and drops to his knees.
Imploded by
grief.
THE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape
rises -- a AMPSUIT. Inside -- MILES QUARITCH, his face
bloody, his eyes burning.
He slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides
into the forest.
145.
QUARITCH'S AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle.
He
sees something through the foliage ahead -- the SHACK.
INSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link. Through a
window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing.
QUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to
the firing button--
WHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him.
Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses
Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its
razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor.
THE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long
burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which
SHRIEKS but --
NEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock,
tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but --
Quaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost
crushing Neytiri.
CLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's KNIFE
and --
QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the
thanator's chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips
on top of it, stabbing.
QUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning
Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped.
Quaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him,
panting, scared but defiant.
JAKE (O.S.)
It's all over Quaritch --
Quaritch turns, seeing Jake DROPPING from a tree limb. The
`suit rises slowly, knife glinting in the morning sun.
QUARITCH
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.
JAKE
Kinda hoped you'd say that.
QUARITCH SURGES forward. JAKE closes fast, snatching up the
broken CANNON as --
146.
Quaritch SLASHES DOWN with the knife and Jake parries,
blocking it with the cannon. He CLOSES faster than the suit
can move and --
K-CRACK! -- SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy,
crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with
the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash
and --
SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again
-- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying.
QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away.
Jake rolls just before --
THUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He
scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and --
JAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the
canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks.
Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but --
INSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the
shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks.
The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and --
FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing
it but not penetrating. Jake's link sits just inside.
INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and --
P-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air.
Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to
pick up his KNIFE.
NEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs
free from underneath three tons of thanator.
QUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake.
QUARITCH
How does it feel to betray your own race?
Then, inexplicably, he TURNS.
Walks away.
FROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us
and --
CRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the
window. He is reaching inside for the Link when --
JAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he
has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and --
147.
JAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritch's shoulder
and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge
of the cockpit but --
QUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake
slams to the ground.
INSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic
Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK.
NEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull
her other leg out.
THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and --
JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of
the attack drives him to his knees as --
QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is
pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat.
INSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay
connected as --
THE KNIFE reaches his throat as --
THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritch's chest.
He looks up.
NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure,
she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly.
TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still.
QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches
the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic
laugh -- he dies.
NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing
Quaritch, she lowers her father's bow.
JAKE sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and --
MO'AT tends to the mortally wounded TSU'TEY as AVATAR JAKE
arrives with Neytiri. Mo'at has bound his wounds, but by her
expression, it is clear he cannot be saved.
Jake kneels and Tsu'tey opens his eyes.
Through a haze of
pain, he recognizes Jake.
TSU'TEY
(NA'VI)
I See you, Jakesully.
JAKE
I See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.
TSU'TEY
Are the people safe?
JAKE
They're safe.
Tsu'tey weakly clutches his severed queue.
TSU'TEY
I can never ride again, or bond with my
woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa. I can
not lead the People. You will lead them,
Jakesully.
JAKE
No. I'm not officer material.
TSU'TEY
It is decided. Now do the duty of
Olo'eyctan. Set my spirit free.
JAKE
I'm not killing you.
TSU'TEY
I am already dead.
149.
JAKE
No.
TSU'TEY
It is the way. And it is good. I will be
remembered --
Tsu'tey's voice is weak, but thick with emotion.
TSU'TEY
-- I fought with Toruk Macto, we were
brothers -- and he was my last shadow.
TSU'TEY'S HAND clasps with Jake's in a fierce grip. Jake
draws his knife.
TSU'TEY'S POV -- Jake leans forward, blocking the sun.
HIS SHADOW falls across Tsu'tey.
JAKE
(NA'VI)
Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the
Mother Spirit.
By his movement, we know that he has ended Tsu'tey's pain.
Jake's eyes well with tears as he continues reciting the
prayer for the dead, and his Na'vi words carry over as we --
DISSOLVE TO:
Na'vi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of Hell's
Gate.
Banshees roost on the roofs of the modules, and stingbats
flutter about, unimpeded. The SENTRY GUNS are silent, and
the GATES are open to the forest.
JAKE (V.O.)
A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen.
Max, Norm, and a few of the avatars hold AR's as the
personnel of Hell's Gate file up the cargo ramp of the
remaining shuttle. The evicted humans are sullen and angry,
like POW's.
JAKE and NEYTIRI stand together, watching the departure of
the Sky People.
PARKER SELFRIDGE shuffles up the ramp. His eyes -- the eyes
of a lost soul -- meet JAKE'S. He disappears into the ship.
CUT TO:
150.
ISV VENTURE STAR hangs suspended against the dark side of
PANDORA. The ISV's antimatter engines BLAZE to life and it
accelerates out of orbit.
What remains IN FRAME is a virgin, primeval world. Spanning
the black continents is a vast reticulated lace-work of
BIOLUMINESCENCE -- a ghostly WEB connecting all of Pandora.
CUT TO:
The sun's rays shaft down through the layers of canopy.
JAKE (V.O.)
The forest will heal, and so will the
hearts of the People. New life keeps the
energy flowing, like the breath of the
world.
NEYTIRI, obviously pregnant, is bow-fishing in the shallows.
Children jump and squeal with laughter in the river.
JAKE (V.O.)
This is my last videolog.
THE WILLOWS glow softly. The entire Omaticaya clan is
gathered, seated in a prayer circle around the Mother Tree.
JAKE (V.O.)
I better wrap this up. There's a funeral
tonight, and I don't want to be late. It
was someone very close to me.
WIDE SHOT, moving in across the concentric rings of people,
all plugged-in and softly chanting. MOVING toward the
center, over the figure of Mo'at, to hover above --
NEYTIRI, kneeling beside two FIGURES on the dais --
151.
JAKE and his AVATAR lie head to head. Human Jake is wearing
an exomask. Both figures are still, hands folded, covered in
translucent silken shrouds of ROOT-CILIA.
CAMERA CLOSES IN as Neytiri removes the mask from Jake's
human face. She gently closes his dead eyes with her
fingertips. Then bends and kisses him.
MOVE INTO CU on AVATAR JAKE as Neytiri's hand comes into
frame, stroking his cheek. TIGHTENING slowly to--
ECU JAKE'S EYES. Hold a beat, then --
They open.
