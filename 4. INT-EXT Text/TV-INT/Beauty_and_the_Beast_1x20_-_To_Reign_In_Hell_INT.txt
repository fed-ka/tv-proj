  but happy or effortless, as she tries to keep pace with
  the video workout   doing jumping jacks with her legs and
    windmills with her arms.

                  More time.  Three, four, five,
                  Six, almost done, nine, ten.  Okay,
                  Lets bring it down...

  Cathy exhales a sigh of relief.  This she can do... when
  she notices the curtains to her balcony billowing, the
   door half open.  She stops working out and looks more
    carefully.  A silhouette passes before the curtain.

                                CATHY
                  Vincent?

  As she crosses the room and steps out onto:

6 THE TERRACE

  and approaches the hooded, cloaked figure who turns toward
  her from the slanting shadows...                                                                                        2.

                        Vincent...

  Only it s not Vincent.  Into the light steps an enormous
  and bearded giant-warrior, ERLIK.  For a moment, Cathy
  is paralyzed with fear.

    FLASHCUT


    Vincent senses her panic, starts his journey toward her.

6B RESUME CATHY

    gasping as Erlik swipes at her in a broad, fast, sweep
    ...bringing a large black cloth, sparkling with an
    anaesthetic drug, toward her face.

7 HER POV

  as the blackness overwhelms her.  The only sound now is
  the drone of the aerobics class.  HOLD.  Then:

                                                                    FADE IN;


  The wind moans like a dirge sung by some unseen choir.
  From the dark shadows, Erlik appears, carrying Catherine
  over his shoulder, descending the large stairs, each step
    echoing with metronomic sure-footedness.  As they
    disappear down and down, as if into the very bowels of
  the earth, we:

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO;


  whose face is etched with pity and disdain

                                      PARACELSUS
                Did you really believe that
                all these years?

12A RESUME VINCENT

  in the present, reflecting painfully on those words, and:

                                PARACELSUS' VOICE
                Did you really believe --?

                                                            CUT TO:

13 CU - PARACELSUS' WRIST (FLASHBACK)

  from which the jagged dagger springs forth, glistening,
  and:                                                                                        4.

14 ANOTHER ANGLE

  as Paracelsus deftly slashes Vincent across the chest,
    sending Vincent backward into a table, his lantern
    spinning in the air...

    Vincent touches his hand to the bloody gash on his chest,
  but Paracelsus is upon him. Vincent catches his wrist,
  and with his other hand, strikes Paracelsus, who flies
  back and falls into an unconscious heap.

  The fire is spreading quickly around them, igniting row
  by row -- spitting up flames of every color. Vincent
    hoists Paracelsus up, arm-over-shoulder, supporting
  him across the back, and begins carrying him down the aisle,
    toward safety, Paracelsus' feet dragging like a puppet's,
  into:

15 ADJOINING TUNNEL

  as Paracelsus begins to regain consciousness. His face
    registers horror at the conflagration that's framed by
  the tunnel entrance. Paracelsus shrugs out from under
    Vincent s support. Vincent moves toward him, but Paracelsus
  lifts his wrist-knife, brandishing it against Vincent's
    advancing figure. Paracelsus' eyes glaze in manic defiance.

                                      VINCENT
                        Come with me. There's nothing
                        for you here.

                                      PARACELSUS
                                (shakes his head;
                                 realizing)
                        My gold... my gold!

    Vincent tries to grab Paracelsus, but with this last
    utterance, the old man rushes back to his garden. Vincent
    starts after him, when a burst of flame spits through the
    entrance, consuming Paracelsus' running figure, which
    disappears now in a wall of fire. And as the
    conflagration continues, reflected in Vincent's tormented
  eyes, we PUSH IN SLOWLY and...

                                  FATHER'S VOICE
                          Paracelsus?

16 VINCENT

  still tormented, agitated, very much in the present, and
  we are:                                                                                        5.


    Father is seated behind a desk, trying to digest both 
  this difficult news and Vincent's strange state.

                                        FATHER
                        But how?  I thought --

                                      VINCENT
                                  (overriding)
                        He's alive, Father.

  As Vincent says this, he tosses the gold coin onto
    Father's desk, almost defiantly. The coin is proof
    enough.

                                      VINCENT
                        And he's taken Catherine

                                        FATHER
                        Do you know where?

                                      VINCENT
                        No... Our connection has been
                        broken somehow... and part of me
                        is lost. I've never felt so
                          helpless.
                                (choked)
                        I'm afraid even to wonder.

    Vincent bows his head, as Father rises from behind his
  desk and moves toward him.

                                        FATHER
                        I know Paracelsus. However
                        twisted his mind may be, it's
                        still complex... full of
                        structures and designs.
                                (then)
                        If he meant to kill Catherine,
                        he would have done so already.

    Consoled by Father's logic Vincent slowly looks, up at
    Father.

                                        FATHER
                        He's luring you, Vincent. Calling
                        you away from this place of safety.

                                      VINCENT
                        I have no choice but to try and
                        find her.
                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        6.

17 CONTINUED:

                                        FATHER
                                  (distraught)
                          I know...

  Beat, as Vincent shakes his head.

                                      VINCENT
                        Father: why is Paracelsus doing
                        this?

                                        FATHER
                        Because in his mind, you are all
                        that prevents his return to our
                          world... a world he still
                          considers his own.

  As Vincent picks up the gold coin...

                                        FATHER
                                  (continuing)
                        I'm afraid the consequences of
                        his action may extend far beyond
                        Catherine.

  ... and regards it in his palm thoughtfully.

                                      VINCENT
                        Yes.

                                        FATHER
                        The very future of what we've
                        built here is in the balance.
                        You must expect anything. And you
                        must be careful. Paracelsus has
                        misled you before.

                                      VINCENT
                          I haven't forgotten.

  AS Vincent's gaze focuses inward, remembering...

                                PARACELSUS' VOICE
                        I know more about you than your
                        name.

    Father notices Vincent s distant torment.

                                        FATHER
                          Vincent?

    Vincent regards Father, listening.                                                                                        7.



17 CONTINUED:

                                        FATHER
                          I promise you: there is a truth
                        beyond knowledge.
  After a beat, Vincent nods, and closes his fist around
  the coin.

                                      VINCENT
                        I will take care, Father.

18 INT   PASCAL S PIPE CHAMBER - NIGHT    (MATTE)

    People are communicating. The pipes are alive, tapping and
    clanging. Pascal sits on Winslow's shoulders, reattaching a
  loose fixture on the ceiling of the chamber. Winslow groans
  and suffers under Pascal's weight.

                                      WINSLOW
                        Ever hear of a ladder, Pascal?

                                        PASCAL
                                  (straining)
                        Just one more second.  I've almost
                        got it.
                                (beat)
                        There. 

    Winslow helps Pascal clamber down off his shoulders

                                        PASCAL
                        Thanks, Winslow.
                                (looking around)
                        Now where're my sticks?

  Still irritable, Winslow gestures to the corner, where
    Pascal's sticks are leaning against the wall.

                                      WINSLOW
                          Surprise, right where you left
                        them.

  As Pascal bends down to retrieve the sticks, something
    catches his attention... an old, rusted stump of a pipe
  that thrusts through the floor of the chamber. Pascal
    hunkers down to listen. A faint pinging.

                                        WINSLOW
                        What is it?

                                                             (CONTINUED)                                                                                        8.
18 CONTINUED:

    Grabbing his sticks, Pascal springs to his feet and, moving
    deftly through the chamber, taps out a signal on all the pipes:
  an emergency quiet. It takes a few seconds, but gradually the
    chamber goes SILENT -- except for the old pipe, which continues
    sounding, barely audible, a message repeated over and over again.

                                      WINSLOW
                        Why the all-quiet?

                                        PASCAL
                        Shhh.

                                      WINSLOW
                        Pascal --

                                        PASCAL
                        Listen.

    Winslow concentrates.  After a moment:

                                      WINSLOW
                        I don't recognize the code.

                                        PASCAL
                        I'm remembering.
                                (beat)
                        Yes. A repeated sequence.  Just
                        one word.
                                (to the sound of the
                                 pipe)
                        Vincent... Vincent... Vincent...

  On Winslow's reaction, we:
                                                                    TIME DISSOLVE TO:


  Pascal glances up from the old pipe, as Winslow leads
    Vincent into the chamber.

                                        PASCAL
                          Vincent!

                                      VINCENT
                        Has it stopped?

                                        PASCAL
                        No.  Like a machine

                                      VINCENT
                        Let me listen.
                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        9.
19 CONTINUED:

  Pascal moves aside, and Vincent kneels to listen to the
    sounding. He places his hands around the stump of the
  pipe, trying to intuit the presence on the other end.
  After a moment.

                                        PASCAL
                        Is it Catherine?

    Vincent shakes his head.

                                      VINCENT
                                  (straightening)
                        Tell me, Pascal, where does this
                        pipe lead?

                                        PASCAL
                        Down, down... below the seventh
                        level. After that...
                                (shrugs; then)
                        It's been silent ever since I can
                          remember.

                                      VINCENT
                        How far away's the tapping?

                                        PASCAL
                        Hard to say. The pipe twists in
                        and out of bedrock. But judging
                        by the faintness -- three day's
                          travel... two at least.

                                      VINCENT
                        And the code?

                                        PASCAL
                          Archaic. One of the very first
                        my father taught me. A Morse
                          derivative. You remember,
                          Vincent: before we shorthanded
                        the system.

                                      VINCENT
                        So Paracelsus would know this
                        code...

    Pascal exchanges a concerned glance with Winslow.  Then:

                                        PASCAL
                        He probably invented it

    Vincent considers this.

                                      VINCENT
                        Pascal, do you think you could
                        take me there... to the source?

                                        PASCAL
                        I don't know. I could try.

                                      VINCENT
                        Would you?

                                        PASCAL
                        Of course.

                                      VINCENT
                        Then prepare your things. We must
                        leave at once.

    Vincent starts out of the chamber. Winslow calls after him.

                                      WINSLOW
                          Vincent.

    Vincent pivots to face him.

                                      WINSLOW
                        I'm going too.

                                      VINCENT
                          Winslow, thank you. But already
                        the danger's too great.

                                      WINSLOW
                        If Paracelsus has Catherine, then
                        the danger is to all of us.

                                      VINCENT
                        Yes. But we should try and limit
                        the risk.

                                      WINSLOW
                                (flashing)
                        Vincent... I got my reasons.

    Vincent reads the seriousness of Winslow's resolve.

                                      WINSLOW
                                  (softening)
                          Besides, Pascal says the journey
                        could be many days. You'll need
                        sleep. Somebody will have to stand
                        watch. And three shifts are safer
                        than two.                                                                                        11.

    Vincent is silent for a beat.  Then he places a hand on each of
  their shoulders.

                                      VINCENT
                        You are my friends. I accept your
                        help. But our path...
                        is uncertain. Both of you must
                        promise to return at the first
                        sign of trouble.

                                      WINSLOW
                        I promise.

    Vincent looks to Pascal.

                                        PASCAL
                        I promise.

                                      VINCENT
                                (beat)
                        Then we'll go. The three of us...
                          together.

    CAMERA captures the resolve in all their faces, as we:

                                                            CUT TO:


  still unconscious, Cathy lies in the hull of a dory, as
  Erlik ferries her across this shallow and beautiful body
  of water.

                                                            CUT TO:


  The heat is thick down here, hellish. Cathy begins to
  come to consciousness, and Erlik sets her down on her feet.

21 CLOSE ON CATHY

  Sweat stinging her eyes. She looks warily at Erlik, but
  is too dazed to make a break for it. Instead she tries to
  get her bearings, noting landmarks, etc.                                                                                        12.

22 BACK TO SCENE

  Still dazed and rocky, Cathy is led through the circular
  maze -- past volcanic rock formations, like sculptures.
  Steam escapes through fissures in the walls. She falters,
  and Erlik forces her onward.

                                                    CUT TO:


    MOVING with Cathy and Erlik as they emerge from a narrow,
  dark tunnel into the vastness and light of this natural
    amphitheater -- forged eons ago from hot lava. Several
  other tunnels converge on the first level where they now
    stand. An open pit, ringed by a twenty-foot obsidian
  wall, is below them. Erlik pushes Cathy forward, and only
  now does she notice the tall and gaunt figure standing
    before her, his back turned. Slowly, he pivots...

24 HER POV

  It is Paracelsus, half his face covered by a pounded-gold
  mask, extending from his chin to just above his cheekbone.
  Both eyes bore into her.

25 BACK TO SCENE

  She recognizes him, but from where?  Then she knows...

                                        CATHY
                  Paracelsus...

  On Paracelsus, impassive and evil, we

                                      ACT TWO

  FADE IN:


    Simultaneous voices create a white noise din as a cluster
  of tunnel denizens, including Father, Jamie, and Kipper
    gather around Vincent, Winslow, and Pascal. The travelers
    accept gifts as they pack the last of their provisions
  in makeshift knapsacks, each with a lantern strung to
  the side. Kipper is handing each of them a beautiful stone,
    polished and variegated. To Vincent, who receives his last:

                                        KIPPER
                        It's for good luck

                                      VINCENT
                                (smiling)
                        Thank you, Kipper.

    Vincent pockets the stone and addresses the assembled
    group.

                                      VINCENT
                        And all of you, for your good
                        wishes.

  As Vincent slings the pack over his shoulder, Father steps
    toward Vincent. The look passes between them is one of
    complete and mutual understanding.

                                        FATHER
                        Safe journey, Vincent

    Father takes Vincent's face in his hands and kisses him
    tenderly. Then the two men embrace for a sustained,
    powerful moment. As they part, Father continues to hold
    Vincent's shoulders.

                                        FATHER
                        Come back to us.

    Father slowly lowers his arms. Vincent holds Father's
  look for another moment before he nods, then starts off
  with Winslow and Pascal...

                                  JAMIE (o.s.)
                        Wait!

  as Jamie steps forward, through the crowd, and presents
    herself to the trio. She's tentative, and doesn't speak
  at once.

                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        14.

                        Well, what do you want?

  Jamie is shy but determined

                                        JAMIE
                        I want to go with you

                        What??

  Jamie turns to Vincent, as if in appeal.

                                        JAMIE
                          Catherine's my friend, too.

                                      VINCENT
                                (sympathetic)
                        I know. But where we're going
                        is too far, and the way too
                        dangerous.

                                        JAMIE
                        Too dangerous for who?

                                      WINSLOW
                                 (flashing)
                        For you.

                                        JAMIE
                                (right back)
                        I can take care of myself. I
                        always have.

                                        PASCAL
                        She's got a point.

                                      WINSLOW
                        She's crazy --

                                  (to Vincent)
                        Well I'm right, ain't I? Girl's
                        got no business comin' along.
                        We all know that.

  Jamie looks pleadingly to Vincent, who's sympathetic and
    genuinely feels bad about having to turn her away.                                                                                        15.

                        I m sorry, Jamie.  It's for the
                        Best.

  Jamie does her best to show her indignation, but is near
    tears...

                                        JAMIE
                        Best for who?

                                      WINSLOW
                        Now get. Come on. You've slowed
                        us down enough already.

  Jamie regards the three travelers, her pride sorely
    injured, then turns and EXITS FRAME. Winslow regards
    Vincent and Pascal, slightly abashed. with Jamie gone,
  the hardass veneer falls away, and Winslow softens a bit.

                                      WINSLOW
                        It's just cause I care for her.
                        That's all.

    Winslow is the first to pick up his pack and continue.
  And as Vincent and Pascal follow, we:

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

27 OMITTED


  This is the small chamber from which Erlik emerged, almost
  two stories above the pit itself. It's more like a cave
  in here, with primitively crafted table and chairs,
    completely lined with books. The light is gray and dusty.
  And it's hot. Unbearably hot.

  Erlik stands watching at the opening to the pit: arms
    crossed, impassive... as Cathy sits in one of the chairs,
    mopping her brow with a cloth. Paracelsus approaches,
    thrusting a deep, roughhewn wooden bowl before her.

                                      PARACELSUS
                        Drink or you'll dehydrate.
                          (impatient; off her.
                         reluctance)
                        Go ahead. You're certainly no
                        good to me dead.

                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        16.

27A  CONTINUED:

  Cathy accepts the bowl with both hands. She holds the
  bowl close to her face, as if to smell it, then thirstily
    drinks its contents. Paracelsus watches neutrally as
  Cathy finishes drinking, then looks up at him, almost
    ashamed for having to drink anything proffered by this
  man. She regards him, defiant and inquisitive.

                                        CATHY
                         Why?  Why are you doing this?

  Beat, then:

                                      PARACELSUS
                        To reclaim my home.

  As Paracelsus circles behind Cathy, his bitterness
    rising...

                                      PARACELSUS
                        The world I created years ago.

                                        CATHY
                        And almost destroyed.

                                      PARACELSUS
                        No. It was wrested from me...
                        by the man you know as Father.
                        Just when I was so close to
                        everything I'd ever dreamed of
                        achieving. And even then, after
                        exiling me, he wouldn't allow me
                        to live in peace.

                                        CATHY
                        I know the story, and it's not
                        that simple.

                                      PARACELSUS
                        It is that simple.

                                        CATHY
                        Fifty people died because of you.

                                      PARACELSUS
                          I killed no one. They died
                        because they were fools.

                                        CATHY
                        They were weak. There s a
                          difference...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        17.

  Cathy stiffens as Paracelsus' black-gloved hand brushes
  away her hair, exposing her scarred cheek. She doesn't
  turn to him, but he's right there, over her shoulder, the
  naked half of his face slashed by shadows from his mask.

                                      PARACELSUS
                        Ah, but you're not weak, are you,
                        Catherine? You're strong, intrepid...

                                        CATHY
                                (overlapping)
                        What do you want with me?

                                      PARACELSUS
                                (ignoring her)
                        Once a person has been visited
                        by violence, everything changes.
                        Isn't that so?
                                (then)
                          Nietzche said: "That which does
                        not kill me makes me stronger."
                        Well I am stronger now. Strong
                        enough to go home again.

                                        CATHY
                        You still haven't answered my
                          question.

    Paracelsus yanks Cathy's chin up so that she can see him
  now. . .

                                      PARACELSUS
                        Vincent is the answer to your
                          question. He is all that stands
                        between Father and me... in more
                        ways than you know.

  As Paracelsus removes his half mask, unveiling beneath it
    a grotesque patchwork of burned scar tissue. He holds
    Cathy's chin tightly, forcing her to regard his
    disfigurement.

                                      PARACELSUS
                        And this is why I must destroy
                        him.

  Cathy doesn't flinch, not wanting to draw Vincent with
  her panic. Paracelsus releases her.

                                        CATHY
                        I'm not afraid...
                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        18.

                                      PARACELSUS
                        You will be.
                                (then)
                        You see, Vincent is also coming
                        here to watch you die.

  Cathy steels herself as Paracelsus addresses the giant.

                                      PARACELSUS
                        Go now, Erlik. And make certain
                        that Vincent continues his
                        journey... unaccompanied.

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

  START on a pipe jutting from the ceiling of the tunnel,
     and FOLLOW it down to the uplifted faces of Pascal,
    Winslow, and Vincent.

                                        PASCAL
                        The tapping's stopped.

                        Are you sure it's the same pipe?

    Pascal extracts one of his sticks from his satchel. Taps
  on the pipe. Listens as the sound reverberates.

                                        PASCAL

                        What do we do now?

                        The only thing we can. We
                          continue...

  as they begin to follow the pipe, and turn a dog-leg in
  the tunnel. Before them gapes a large hole in the ground.
    A ladder, black from soot, rises out of the chamber.
    Vincent cautiously nears the edge, and looks down.
    Winslow and Pascal hover behind him.                                                                                        19.
30 VINCENT'S POV - NARCISSA

  down in the hole, taking mineral scrapings from the tunnel
  wall. Her head tips back to observe Vincent and his
    friends -- white cataracts reflecting brilliantly. She
    smiles.

                                      NARCISSA
                          Welcome, children.

                        your friends.

    Vincent, Pascal, and Winslow descend the ladder into the:


  where Narcissa addresses them.

                        And why do you come traveling
                        so far?

                        We are searching for Catherine --

                                      NARCISSA
                        The woman. The answer to all
                          desire... the guide to the deepest
                        chamber of the soul, the life of
                        everything that lives, the death
                        of everything that dies. Mother,
                        sister, mistress, bride...

                                 (aside to Pascal)
                        What the hell's she talking about?

                                      NARCISSA
                                (to Vincent)
                        Why do you seek the woman?

                        She was taken from her home.

                        message on the pipes.

                        And who do you say has taken her?

                                      VINCENT
                          Paracelsus.

          Narcissa visibly recoils at the sound of the name.

                                      VINCENT
                        What is it, Narcissa?

                                      NARCISSA
                                (evasive)
                        I am crazy old woman. Don t
                        listen to me.

                                      VINCENT
                        You have knowledge. Share it with
                        us. It may help us on our
                          journey.

          Narcissa regards him. Finally, she reaches into the
          hidden folds of her clothing and extracts a handful
          of tiny sea shells. Beside her is a small table with
          a deep bowl carved in the thick dark wood. Narcissa
          throws the shells into the bowl... observes the result.

                                      NARCISSA
                        Turn back, Vincent! Journey no
                        more!

                                      VINCENT
                        She is my life, Narcissa. I am
                        bound by my heart to go on.

                                      NARCISSA
                                  (indicating shells)
                        There is death, I see it.

                                      VINCENT
                        I must continue.

                                      NARCISSA
                        Then my first duty is served.
                        I have warned you.

                                      VINCENT
                        I hear your warning.

    Narcissa studies him for a long beat. Then, quietly,
      conspiratorially:

                          Paracelsus, he is not alone.

                                      VINCENT
                        Have you seen him?

                        No, but many down here follow him,
                        protect him. The simple ones,
                        the lost ones...

                                (paranoid)
                        They fear my magic. But I have
                        said too much already...

                        Good luck, children. The way is
                          dangerous before you. But the
                        way... is beautiful.

  She turns away from Vincent. Pascal and Winslow look
    dubiously at each other. ON Vincent, weighing Narcissa's
    words, we:

                                                            CUT TO:


  A) STONE STAIRWAY

  The three travelers, Vincent, Pascal, and Winslow,
    descend the stone stairway, glowing lanterns lighting the
  way. . .

  B) DESCENDING TUNNEL

    Huddled together in the CHAMBER OF THE WINDS, Vincent and
    Winslow look to Pascal for direction. Uncertain, he
    raises his arm, pointing to a distant archway -- and
    forward they go...

                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        22.

  C) LONG TUNNEL

  LONG SHOT as they steer down an impossibly long tunnel,
  three golden points of light marking their progress...

  D) DEEP CREVASSE

  Like mountaineers, they descend a free-hanging rope ladder
    inside a deep crevasse. (Production suggestion: redress
  the elevator shaft as the crevasse.)

34 A FIRE

  spits sparks and embers, encircled by stones

                                  PASCAL (0.S.)
                          I studied everything he ever
                        wrote. The early manuals are
                          brilliant --


  with a high, vault-like ceiling. Vincent, Pascal, and
    Winslow sit around the fire, their packs leaned up against
    several scattered boulders, with straw mats and sleeping
  bags laid out on the ground nearby.

                                        PASCAL
                        The codes, the schematics... It's
                        hard to believe he's the same man.

                                      VINCENT
                        Paracelsus is not the same man.
                        What he has done proves that.

                                        PASCAL
                        I know. But it still makes me
                        sad. All that intelligence and
                          energy...

Pascal trails off, shaking his head.

                                      WINSLOW
                        You got a heart like a soft-boiled
                        egg, you know that?

    Pascal shrugs, privately defending the sadness he feels.
  Then:

                                        PASCAL
                        I'm going to bed. Wake me up when
                        it's my turn for watch.

                                      WINSLOW
                        Yeah. Good night.

  Vincent nods with a cursory smile, then turns back to the
  fire, as Pascal rises and EXITS FRAME...

  In the silence that follows, Winslow notices that Vincent
  is lost in thought, staring into the fire.

                                      WINSLOW
                        So what's on your mind? You've
                        been awful quiet since we left
                        this morning.

  Over the following, Vincent's eyes remain fixed on the fire.

                                      VINCENT
                        I'm just -- thinking... wondering.

                                      WINSLOW
                        About Catherine?

                                      VINCENT
                        Yes...
                                (then)
                        If she is in danger, why am I
                        not feeling her fear?

                                      WINSLOW
                        Don't worry, we'll bring her back.

    Vincent nods, appreciating his friend's concern.  Vincent
    continues to regard Winslow, and after a moment:

                                      VINCENT
                        When you came to me yesterday,
                        to offer your help, you said you
                        had... reasons.

                                      WINSLOW
                                (beat)
                        Yeah

                                      VINCENT
                        Is it Paracelsus?
                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        24.

  Winslow doesn't answer right away. He stokes the fire,
    deeply disturbed as the distant past works its way into
  the present...

                                      WINSLOW
                        I was just a kid when we came to the
                          tunnels. My mother had died and there
                        was just my brother, John and me.
                        He was ten years older, but he was big
                        for eighteen... and strong. So when
                        the Council voted to exile Paracelsus,
                        John was part of the group they sent.

                                      VINCENT
                        To see Paracelsus beyond the
                          perimeter...

  Winslow nods. What follows is painful and emotional for
  him, and it's as though he's seeing in the fire.

                                      WINSLOW
                        Only Paracelsus didn't want to go.
                        They were crossing the bridge in
                        the Whispering Gallery... when
                        Paracelsus started to put up a
                          fight... and he shoved John over
                        the edge... into the abyss.

    Winslow quickly wipes at a gathering tear

                                      VINCENT
                                (sympathetic)
                          Winslow. . .

                                      WINSLOW
                                (overlapping; bitter)
                        So I grew up in the tunnels alone,
                        in a place John promised me was
                        safe, always knowing deep down
                        that the exile wasn't punishment
                        enough.

                                      VINCENT
                        I'm sorry...

    Winslow nods, steeling himself against the fresh pain and
    bitterness of an old memory by changing the subject.
  After a moment:

                                      WINSLOW
                          Anyway... Whyn't you get some
                        rest. I'll keep watch.
                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        25.

35 CONTINUED: (3)

                                      VINCENT
                        I'm not tired. But you should
                        sleep. We've had a long day.

  After a beat, Winslow nods, grudgingly accepting Vincent's
    offer. But something still bothers him.

                                      WINSLOW
                                (rising)
                        Good night.

                                      VINCENT
                        Good night, Winslow

    Winslow takes a few steps away, then:

                                      WINSLOW
                          Vincent?

    Vincent looks over his shoulder at Winslow

                                      WINSLOW
                        I want you to know: I'm not doin'
                        this just because of John. He's
                        dead. I accepted that a long time
                        ago.
                                (then)
                        It's also because... I happen to
                        like Catherine. She's a good
                        woman -- I've always said so.
                        What's between you two is
                          something I've never known myself.
                        But seeing it, I know it's real...
                        and I believe in it.

    Winslow's look connects with Vincent: it's the most
    intimate moment they've ever shared. Then he turns his
  back without another word and moves to his sleeping mat.
    Vincent looks after him with nothing less than the love of
    a brother, then returns his attention to the fire...

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:


  The trio forges ahead, still following the pipe along a
    rocky-walled tunnel. A light mist floats down the tunnel
    towards them, like a spirit.

                                                            TIME LAPSE DISSOLVE TO:

  The mist has become a heavy fog that now swirls, all but
    blinding them. Vincent puts his hood up against the cold.
    Pascal and Winslow cover their mouths and noses with thick
    scarves, like caravan traders in the Sahara. Leading the
  way, Vincent reaches back for Winslow's hand, and Winslow,
  in turn, reaches back for Pascal's. Together in a chain,
  they proceed -- making slow step-by-step progress. After
    a while, Vincent stops and gestures with his free arm
    towards the pipe.

                                      VINCENT
                        Look...

    Pascal and Winslow look to the pipe on the wall...
  stops abruptly, rusting off at its corroded rim.

                                      WINSLOW
                        What now?

    Pascal moves to examine the pipe. Then he kneels and,
    brushing away some sand, reveals the broken end of the
  pipe, lying half-buried on the ground. He follows it ten
  yards or so, until both the fragment and the tunnel wall
  come to an end. They are:


    Although to them it is just some huge chamber, the water
    obscured completely by the fog. Pascal lifts his head to
    Vincent.

                                        PASCAL
                        That s it.  It end here.

39 CLOSE ON - VINCENT

    considering the alternatives...

                                  WINSLOW'S VOICE
                        Where the hell are we?

40 OMITTED

41 RESUME SCENE

    Vincent refocuses on Pascal who still crouches near the
    ground -- when suddenly, the fragmented section of the
  pipe heaves up underneath the small man and sends him 
    catapulting backward. Vincent whirls around                                                                                          27.

42 HIS POV - ERLIK

    A colossus rising out of the swirling mist. He advances
  on Vincent and Winslow, holding the section of pipe in
  front of him like a massive club.

43 RESUME SCENE

    Vincent roars and charges, but Erlik catches him mid-
    stride with a heavy blow to the shoulder that sends
    Vincent smashing sideways to the sandy ground.

44  NEW ANGLE - WINSLOW

    reacting, as Erlik closes in on him. Winslow feints to
  his left, and then grabs hold of the free end of the pipe.
  They struggle for a moment... until the giant drives with
  his legs. The pipe forces through Winslow's hands and
    impacts his chest, jousting him powerfully backward.
    Winslow's head snaps forward, and he crumples.

44A ANGLE - PASCAL

  still on the ground, horrified by the sight.

45 VINCENT

    staggers to his feet, in the full throes of bestial rage.
    Snarling and roaring, he attacks the towering Erlik, who
  turns to face the full force of Vincent's fury. Already
  upon him, Vincent rips and slashes with his protracted
    claws. At first, Erlik retreats from the onslaught, his
  chest gashed open. But when Vincent surges forward in
    a second wave, Erlik uses Vincent's momentum to heave him
  up over his head, flip him over, and send him crashing
  to the ground...

  Erlik moves in, as if to deliver the finishing blow, but
    passes Vincent, moving instead to Pascal, who scuttles
  along the sand in a futile effort to avoid the giant,
  who is upon him in no time. Erlik raises his fists over
    Pascal's head, when he suddenly jerks forward -- struck
  by something in his upper back. He reaches for it and, 
  with a grimace, pulls an arrow out of his shoulder. He
  turns to see:

46 HIS POV   JAMIE - THROUGH FOG

    framed by the tunnel entrance, reloading a homemade
    crossbow. A quiver of arrows is strapped to her back.                                                                                        28.

47 RESUME SCENE

  Erlik advances menacingly toward her. Jamie lets
    another arrow fly -- this one striking Erlik in the chest.
  The giant groans loudly in pain, and then plucks the arrow
  out. Jamie begins to reload quickly, almost frantically, as:

48 VINCENT

    pushes back up on to his feet and moves toward the giant,
  but stops abruptly:

48A HIS POV

    nothing but swirling mist.  Erlik has vanished into the
  heavy fog, and:

48B ANGLE - JAMIE

  who's managed to reload, but now finds herself aiming at
    nothing... Immediately, she joins Vincent, who has rushed
  back towards Winslow. Pascal is already there, huddled
  down, cradling Winslow's head in his arms. He glances up
  at Vincent and Jamie, tears and shock in his eyes.

                                        PASCAL
                        He's dead.

  FADE IN:


  The fog has dissipated, though residual patches hover here
  and there, over lake and shore. In the bleak light,
    around a stone grave stands Vincent, Jamie, and Pascal,
    mourning their dead friend. After a long, silent moment:

                                        PASCAL
                        I'm remembering when we were kids.
                        How we used to tease Winslow.
                        He would try so hard not to lose
                        his temper, but you could always
                        see everything in his face.
                          Remember at the Common meeting
                        when Father named him to the Council.
                        You could see it then,
                        in his eyes -- that he finally
                        knew how much we cared and
                          respected him.

                                      VINCENT
                        That's a good memory to have.

    50 ANGLE -

          stoic, strangely numb.

    51 RESUME SCENE

                                      VINCENT
                        Winslow loved all of us.
                          Fiercely. We were his family.
                        Nothing could ever change that
                        for him. Not conflict. Not
                        anger. Not even death. Winslow
                        will always be part of us. In
                        our hearts. Let us remember him
                        for his strength... and for his
                          courage.

          Vincent places his lantern beside the rock mound. Jamie
          looks down at her hands, but she can't dam the tears which
          begin to well, or still the convulsive sobs which begin
          to shake her body. Vincent sees this, and takes Jamie
          into his arms. Jamie accepts Vincent's comfort, and
          begins to cry openly, burying her face in Vincent's chest.
          Her pain brings Vincent's to the surface.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        30.
51 CONTINUED:

                                (softly)
                        He'll continue to live, Jamie...
                        through us... through our memory
                        of him.
                                (then)
                        Allow yourself the time to mourn...
                        and your pain will soften. I promise.

    Pascal steps up to his friends, regarding them sadly.
  After a moment, Jamie disengages from Vincent, wiping
  her tears with her sleeve, struggling to regain her
    composure.
                                        JAMIE
                                (with resolve)

                                      VINCENT
                        No.

  The tragedy of Winslow has instilled in Vincent a
    determination that invites no discussion. Yet he is
    remorseful for his brusqueness.

                                      VINCENT
                        I'm sorry: but I am responsible
                        for what's happened...

                        We came by our own choice, all
                        of us.

                                      VINCENT
                        I am still responsible. And I
                        can no longer share that burden...
                        even with my friends.

    Vincent is intractable

                                        PASCAL
                        Where will you go? How will you
                        find your way?

                        I'll follow the shore... around
                        this lake. Or I'll cross it.
                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        31.

    Vincent regards Pascal and Jamie, and after a beat:

                                      VINCENT
                        You must go back. Tell Father
                        and the others what happened
                        here... and why I had to continue
                        alone.

    Pascal nods, while Jamie regards Vincent, consoled and
  adult enough to understand the importance of Vincent's
    request. All is quiet -- save for the dancing wind, which
  is still touching her heels down, here and there, in the
    half-lifted fog.

    Vincent walks alone, hugging the shore, where a strange
  blue hue glows around the circumference.  His steps are
    heavy, as he reconciles Winslow s death and anticipates his
    confrontation with Paracelsus.  Occasionally, he lifts his
  head to take in the ironic beauty of the lake, its expanse
  and mystery.  Then something catches his attention.

57 VINCENT'S POV

    a lean-to about fifty yards away, near water's edge.
  Smoke drifts upward from the clay chimney, and there is
    a kind of skiff or gondola floating in the water, moored
  by a rope to a stake in the sand.

58 RESUME VINCENT

  as he moves toward the lean-to. When he's about ten yards
  from the structure, he calls out:

                                      VINCENT
                        Hello!

  He pauses before calling again.
                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        32.
58 CONTINUED:
                                      VINCENT
                        Hello.

  Just as a small man (WATERMAN) emerges from the lean-to,
    harried, cranky, and altogether unsurprised by Vincent's
    appearance. He's anywhere between sixty and eighty, with
  long white hair and a scruffy beard, wearing a robe-like
    outfit woven of coarse cotton.

                                      WATERMAN
                        What're you yelling for? I heard
                        you fine the first time.

    Waterman's look transforms quickly from expectation to
    impatience.

                                      WATERMAN
                        Well, what do you want?

                                      VINCENT
                        I need to cross the water.

                                      WATERMAN
                        It's a long way. What's there?

                                      VINCENT
                        A  man... Paracelsus.

                                      WATERMAN
                        Never heard of him.
                                (then, shrugs)
                        Anyway, I can't take you. I'm
                        too busy.

  As Waterman turns back to his lean-to...

                                      VINCENT
                        Please --
                                (Waterman pauses, turns)
                        Your boat...

                                      WATERMAN
                        What about my boat?

                                      VINCENT
                          I borrow it?

    Waterman scratches his chin while he looks Vincent over,
    appraisingly.

                                      WATERMAN
                        Do you have any money?

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        33.

58 CONTINUED: (2)

                                      VINCENT
                                (incredulous)
                        -- Money?

                                      WATERMAN
                        What, you expect me to give my
                        one worldly possession to a
                          complete stranger? Without
                          compensation? I may be old, but
                        I'm not stupid.

                                      VINCENT
                        I have no money...

                                      WATERMAN
                        Then I have no boat.

  The last syllable fades away as Vincent almost
    accidentally feels for and finds the melted gold coin.
    Greatly surprised himself, he holds the coin out for
    Waterman, who all but snatches it from Vincent's palm,
    eyeing it with satisfaction.

                                      WATERMAN
                        This'll do. This is just fine.

  And he pockets the coin right away, not missing a beat
  as he circles around to the back of the lean-to. Vincent
    follows...

59 ANGLE - BOAT

  From here we can see that it's little more than a narrow
  raft: a flat-bottomed rectangle with shallow sides.

                                      WATERMAN
                        So who are you anyway?

                                      VINCENT
                        My name is Vincent.

    Ignoring -- or at least not responding to Vincent's --
    Waterman pulls out a ten-foot pole impaled in the sand.

                                      WATERMAN
                                (handing the pole to him)
                        It's shallow enough, so you can
                        use this to push off the bottom.

  He gestures impatiently to the waiting skiff.

                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        34.

    Vincent steps into the boat, and:

61 RESUME SCENE

  As Waterman unhooks the looped rope, and tosses it into
  the boat, which starts to drift out a little. Vincent
    plumbs the depth with the pole. And as Vincent
    disappears into the darkness of the lake, we:

                                                            CUT TO:

62 A PYRE

  of wood and thatch, behind which stands four tall and
    massive Stonehenge-like monoliths.

                                      PARACELSUS
                        This is the stage upon which your
                        death will be played...

  WIDEN slowly to reveal:


  the pyre is set back into a ground-level cavern, framing
  it like a shrine. Erlik's arms are wrapped around one
  of the massive monoliths, as he lifts it and places it
    closer to the mound. Cathy stands between Paracelsus and
  the ominous pyre.

    WARNING: THIS IS DUMMY DIALOGUE

                                      PARACELSUS

                                        CATHY
                            I'm not afraid to die.

                                      PARACELSUS
                        Good.

                                      CATHY
                        But I'm not in a hurry, either.

                         (CONTINUED)                                                                                        35.

  with Cathy, as she runs through the dark tunnel, coming at
  once to a fork. She makes the split second choice, goes
    right, disappearing into the dusty light.

67 ANGLE - CATHY

    running down a long stretch, harder and harder, around
  a dog leg, and soon comes to another fork, this time
    choosing to go left. She glances back over her shoulder
  as she passes a perpendicular junction, and decides to
    continue past it. But the tunnel dead ends a hundred
  yards further up. Fighting fatigue, she sprints back to
  the perpendicular junction, and into the adjacent
    tunnel...

  as Cathy takes another dog-leg, really hard, pushing
    herself to the limit, past that invisible wall within
    herself... when she sees a golden light at the end of this
    stretch of tunnel. She sprints for it, and we are with
  her as she passes through, into the light, and...

  as Cathy trips and falls headlong onto the ground.
    Gasping for oxygen, she lifts her head, realizing with
    horror that she's back where she started. Erlik steps
  up to her, towering over her fallen figure, just as a deep
    laughter begins, echoing through the high chamber. Cathy
  turns to find Paracelsus, standing where she left him.
  Over his demonic laughter, CAMERA PULLS BACK as Cathy
  grows smaller, framing her utter helplessness.

                                      ACT FOUR

FADE IN:


    Vincent pulls his raft onto the beach, beside a dory.
  His eyes travel up the steep bank.

73 HIS POV

    Erlik's footsteps mark a clear path in the mud, tracking
  up to a huge stone archway inlaid in the tunnel wall.

74 RESUME SCENE

    Vincent glances back over his shoulder at the two crafts.
  Eyes narrowing in thought. He turns and pushes the dory
  back into the water, setting it adrift. PUSH IN on
    Vincent's face as he watches the current carry the dory
    gently into the darkness. His expression tells us of the
    intent and gamble of his decision.

                                                            CUT TO:


    Vincent passes underneath the stone archway into an
    antechamber -- where Er1ik's footsteps come to an end on
  the hard-packed soil. Immediately, the heat hits him like a
    physical blow, his hand instinctively shielding his face
  from the fevered air...


    A choice of three tunnels fans out before him. Vincent
  opts for the one in the middle, and, ducking his head,
    enters. But as he proceeds, the passage grows narrower
  and narrower, until he can no longer squeeze through.
  He is forced to turn around, and...


  Back in the antechamber, Vincent now chooses the tunnel to
  the right. Once inside, it immediately forks again.
    Confronted with yet another decision, Vincent pauses,
    considering... He makes his choice.

                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                        37.

    Vincent passes volcanic rock formations (as did Paracelsus
  and Cathy in the first act). Fissures in the walls release
    pressure in the form of jets of steam. Vincent presses on...

    Vincent cautiously steps out into the dusty gray light
  of the pit, turning, scanning all around him. No one is
    there. No sound. No movement. Vincent steps toward the
    center, calling out...

                                      VINCENT
                        Catherine!

  His voice echoes and re-echoes throughout the vast room.
  When the last, distant syllable dies, Vincent calls out
    again.

                                      VINCENT
                          Paracelsus...

  This time, Paracelsus' voice echoes hauntingly from some unseen
    source.

                                        PARACELSUS (o.s.)
                        "Better to reign in hell, than
                        serve in heav'n," eh, Vincent?

                        Milton, actually.

    Vincent scans the cavern mouths.  Still nothing.  He hears
    a shuffling noise...

85 CONTINUED;

    Silence. Long beat. Vincent's concentration is intense,
    piqued. Then, he senses something, and heads toward one
  side of the pit, when:

                                        PARACELSUS(o.s.)

                        I've come for Catherine.

                                      PARACELSUS
                                (emphatic)
                        You've also come for yourself.

                                      VINCENT
                        No.

                                      PARACELSUS
                        And you deserve to know the truth
                        before you die.

    Vincent stops now, before and below Paracelsus, almost
    afraid to hear this, but knowing that he must. And after
    a long beat, Paracelsus continues, like some grand
    inquisitor delivering a sentence:

                                      PARACELSUS
                        You should know that it was I who
                        found you... wrapped in rags.
                          Starving. It was I who saved your
                        life... from what fate, only God
                        can say.                                                                                        39.

91 CLOSE - VINCENT

  As Paracelsus tosses something twenty feet down to
    Vincent, who catches it in both hands.

    a tarnished and slightly dented heart-shaped charm on a
    delicate gold chain.

    Tentatively, Vincent opens the locket. Inside there's
    a tiny photograph, sepia-toned and cracked, of an
    attractive dark-haired woman. Vincent regards this link
  to his past with awe...

                                   CATHY (o.s.)

                          Catherine...

96 RESUME SCENE

    Vincent quickly pockets the locket, but as he hastens
    toward Catherine, Erlik steps from the shadow in front
  of her. Vincent stops, as Erlik pushes off with one hand
    vaulting twenty feet to the ground below.

96 CONTINUED:

  The two mythic creatures face off squarely in the center
  of the pit. Above them, on opposite sides of the coliseum,
    Paracelsus and Catherine watch their respective champions...

    Vincent is better prepared this time, and knows that his
    advantages are speed and agility. As Erlik advances with
    a mighty blow, Vincent ducks beneath it and pivots, facing
  Erlik now from the other side. Erlik wheels around,
    sweeping Vincent's space to grab him close. Vincent
    sidesteps the attempt by inches, following through with
    a slashing attack which draws first blood from the side
  of Erlik's head and neck.

  Erlik is stunned, as Vincent advances with a series of
  quick strikes, only some of which Erlik manages to parry.
    Vincent's attack staggers the giant, sending him backward
    several yards, covering his face.

97 LOW ANGLE (OVERCRANK) - VINCENT

  as he issues a blood-curdling ROAR and springs toward the
  giant -- virtually horizontal, like a lion leaping in for
  the kill. But Erlik catches Vincent's full force, and
  uses the momentum to heave Vincent over his shoulder,
    smashing Vincent against the sharp obsidian wall. Vincent
  falls to the ground, but pushes himself up -- just as
  Erlik reaches him, lifting him effortlessly overhead and
    flinging him into the center of the pit.

98 ANGLE - CATHY

    feeling the bone-crushing pain of Vincent's fall

                                        CATHY
                          Vincent!

99 VINCENT

  turns toward her voice, and:

    100 HIS POV

  fuzzy around the edges of his vision: it is Catherine.                                                                                        41.

101 ANGLE

  as Vincent gets up again to face the approaching giant,
    though his legs can scarcely support his weight. Vincent
    swings at Erlik, but the giant easily parries the blow,
  and hammers with both hands at the base of Vincent's neck.
    Vincent crumbles to his knees... then Erlik pounds him
    again, to the very edge of consciousness.

    Vincent and Cathy now sit huddled close in the shallow
  hull of the raft, letting the current carry them homeward.
  Cathy is holding the locket in her palm, gazing at the
    photograph inside.
