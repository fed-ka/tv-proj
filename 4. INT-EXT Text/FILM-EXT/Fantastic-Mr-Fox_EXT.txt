An apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill. A handsome
fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans
against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed, chewing
on a reed of wild grass. He holds an apple core in his paw.
He spits out a seed. He looks off across a meadow that
descends into the valley below.
A female fox strides briskly up the hill. Her coat is a
paler, especially beautiful shade of fox-red, and she wears
men's trousers and a dark tunic. Fox says as she approaches:
FOX
What'd the doctor say?
MRS. FOX
Nothing. Supposedly, it's just a twenty-
four hour bug. He gave me some pills.
FOX
(REASSURINGLY)
I told you. You probably just ate some
bad gristle.
Fox brushes the fur on Mrs. Fox's ears with his paws. They
walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the
path. Fox points:
FOX
Should we take the short cut or the
scenic route?
MRS. FOX
Let's take the short cut.
FOX
But the scenic route is so much prettier.
MRS. FOX
(SHRUGS)
OK, let's take the scenic route.
FOX
Great. It's actually slightly quicker,
anyway.
Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a
quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her
waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off
down the scenic route.
2.
A rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn, a tin silo, and
a rickity windmill. There is a sheep in a little pasture. A
sign on a rail says Berkus Squab. Fox and Mrs. Fox watch from
the bushes outside a fence.
MRS. FOX
What is a squab?
FOX
You know what a squab is. It's like a
pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of
bird we can eat.
Fox motions toward the edge of the property.
FOX
Should we go through the hole under the
horse fence or climb the rail over the
bridle path?
MRS. FOX
Well, I guess the horse fence would be a
little safer.
FOX
But the bridle path puts us out right
next to the squab shack.
Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods
nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny.
FOX
What's wrong? I've never seen you like
this. You're acting all skittish. Don't
worry. I've been stealing birds for a
living since before I could trot.
MRS. FOX
(SHRUGS)
OK, let's take the --
FOX
No, we'll do the horse fence. You gave me
the scenic route already.
Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly:
FOX
By the way, you look unbelievably
beautiful tonight. You're practically
glowing. Maybe it's the lighting.
3.
Mrs. Fox is, in fact, glowing, albeit ever so slightly. She
stares at Fox enigmatically. Fox touches his paw to her
cheek.
(NOTE: an alternate version of Mrs. Fox will be used for this
shot which can be literally lit from within.)
With the speed, grace, and precision of athletes, Fox and
Mrs. Fox: dart through a hole under a painted fence; race
along a thin trail next to a garage; crawl beneath a window
where a blonde woman serves an early dinner, dealing
hamburgers like playing cards to three little, blond
children; creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever
sleeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes; and
shimmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond,
bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet, completely
pulverizing it into sawdust. They arrive in front of a wooden
shed. Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a
rapid reverse-flip with a flourish.
Fox lifts a loose board. He looks to Mrs. Fox and puts his
finger to his lips for her to be quiet. She shrugs
impatiently. They duck inside.
They come back out. Each holds a dead, bloody pigeon in
his/her teeth. They start to run away. Fox looks up above
them. He stops. He frowns. He takes the pigeon out of his
mouth and says curiously, pointing toward the sky:
FOX
What's that? I think that's a fox-trap!
Look at this.
MRS. FOX
Get away from there.
FOX
Is it spring-loaded? Yeah...
(pointing to different spots)
I guess if you come from over there, and
you're standing at the door to the squab
shack, this little gadget probably
triggers the --
(gesturing to Mrs. Fox)
Move out of the way, darling. That's
right where it's going to land.
Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm.
MRS. FOX
Come on! Stop it! Let's go!
4.
Fox pulls on a little, hanging wire. A chain unrolls rapidly
from a pulley, and a steel cage falls slap down on top of
them. A small tag on the base of it says Badoit et Fils. Fox
and Mrs. Fox stand motionless, side by side, in disbelief.
FOX
No, it just falls straight down right
here, doesn't it? I guess it's not spring-
loaded.
Sounds come from around the farm: the dog barks, doors open,
voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox turns to Fox and says
QUIETLY:
MRS. FOX
I'm pregnant.
Fox stares at Mrs. Fox. He is confused but moved.
FOX
Wow. We're going to have a cub. Honey,
that's great news!
MRS. FOX
If we're still alive tomorrow morning, I
want you to find another line of work.
Pause. Fox nods.
CUT TO:
A wide shot of the entire valley. There are thick woods,
green and yellow fields, two ponds, a small village, and a
river running through the middle.
TITLE:
2 YEARS LATER ( 12 Fox-Years)
The entrance to a tunnel under a dirt mound covered with
holly bushes.
A beaver dam across a bend in a fast stream. A still pond
sits above it. There is an entrance tunnel tucked beneath a
rock.
Bunce stands up to his nose in water. The depth reads 4FT.
BADGER (V.0.)
He's so short his chin would probably be
under water in the shallow end of any
swimming pool on the planet.
Ash stands poised on a high branch over an inflatable
swimming pool printed with a red-tartan plaid pattern. He
wears over-sized swim trunks with a pattern of acorns printed
on them. Fox sits in the grass eating an apple below with
Mrs. Fox. She is painting at an easel. Ash yells:
ASH
Watch this, Dad!
Fox looks up. Ash leaps into the air and does a spectacularly
awkward back-flip during which he appears to have four arms
and three legs randomly attached to his body, flailing
wildly. He hits the water by the side of his head and smacks
into the surface back-first with a pained yelp. Fox grimaces.
He claps mildly.
(NOTE: an alternate version of Ash with four arms and three
legs randomly attached to his body will be used for this
stunt.)
FOX
Good jump, Ash! Remember to keep your
tail tucked!
Fox looks at Mrs. Fox's canvas. It is a picture of the pond
and landscape in severe weather with black clouds and
lightning bolts. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox raises an
eyebrow.
15.
FOX
Still painting thunderstorms, I see.
Fox sees a small, Samsonite suitcase on the ground next to a
pair of yellow sneakers. He frowns.
FOX
Whose suitcase is that?
A boy's voice shouts from the high tree branch:
KRISTOFFERSON
Hello, everyone! Good afternoon!
Fox, Mrs. Fox, and Ash look up, surprised. A second Fox cub
stands poised on the edge of the limb. He is taller, leaner,
sleeker, and it is immediately apparent even by his posture
infinitely more graceful than Ash. He is Kristofferson. He
wears a professional Speedo with a patch on it that says Swim
Team. Fox brightens.
FOX
Kristofferson! Welcome to our little
tree! I see you brought your swimming
trunks!
Kristofferson steps off the branch and performs a reserved
but perfect jack-knife. He enters the water splashlessly. Fox
leaps to his feet, applauding with his paws above his head,
whistling and hollering:
FOX
Look at that! This kid's a natural! I'm
speechless, Kristofferson!
Kristofferson smiles modestly and shrugs. Ash stares at him
stonily. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox.
FOX
Plus, he knows karate.
Fox and Kylie sit in a porch swing on one of the middle
branches of Fox's tree. They drink cups of coffee. Crickets
chirp.
FOX
Kids are crazy, aren't they? You got to
try it, though. Raising a family.
KYLIE
Yeah. Sometimes I feel like maybe I
MIGHT --
FOX
What do you think of this tree, by the
way? It's great, huh?
KYLIE
(HESITATES)
Yeah. No, I was just saying how some-
TIMES --
FOX
I have one last part of what I was about
to say.
KYLIE
OK. Go ahead.
FOX
I'm going broke. You want to help me
steal some chickens?
CUT TO:
Fox's study, the next morning. A map of the valley with notes
and arrows written all over it is spread across a desk. The
door is closed with a towel jammed under it. A cricket match
plays loudly on the radio. Fox sits in his armchair. Kylie
sits in a creaky rocking chair.
FOX
I used to do this professionally, and I
was very successful at it. I had to get
out of it for personal reasons, but I've
decided to secretly quit my job slash got
fired to pursue it again. I'm bringing
you in as my secretary and personal
assistant.
18.
KYLIE
OK!
FOX
(PRICKLY)
This is actually kind of a big deal, so
don't just say, "OK!"
KYLIE
OK. Well, thank you.
FOX
(clearing is throat)
I'm going totape this formyrecords,so
don't make a lot of sounds --meaning
stop rocking.
KYLIE
(DEFENSIVELY)
Well, maybe we ought to turn off the
radio, then. That's noisier than --
FOX
I don't want people to eavesdrop on us,
Kylie. Let me just tell this.
Kylie stops rocking. Fox presses record on a tape recorder.
HE BEGINS:
FOX
Master Plan. Phase one. Side A.
CUT TO:
That night. Fox stands on a rock at the edge of the woods
looking through his binoculars. He lowers them and gives a
hand-signal. Kylie joins him, and they start out along the
moonlit ridge. Fox wears a dark car-coat and a black cap.
Kylie has on a navy ski-hat.
FOX (V.0.)
We'll start with Boggis' Chicken House
#1. His only security is a few old
hunting beagles and a low stone wall. Now
a word about beagles: never look a beagle
directly in the eye. And if --
KYLIE (V.0.)
(INTERRUPTING)
Why not?
CUT TO:
19.
Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. Kylie
SAYS BLITHELY:
KYLIE
Beagles aren't so tough.
FOX
(ANNOYED)
Yeah? Well, first of all, one of these
beagles has chronic rabies, which he's on
medication for, and if you get bit by him
you have to get shots in your stomach for
six months. And, second -- listen, I'm
not going to justify this to you. Just
pay attention and stop interrupting me.
I'm taping this.
Fox and Kylie shimmy down a steep embankment and cross a
stream.
FOX (V.0.)
I picked some blueberries, butterflied
them with a scalpel, and laced each one
with ten milligrams of high-potency
sleeping powder.
INSERT:
Fox's paws meticulously sprinkle a powdered mickey into a
dissected blueberry and stitch it shut with red thread.
FOX (V.0.)
Enough to tranquilize a charging gorilla.
CUT TO:
Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now
smoke pipes.
KYLIE
How do we make them eat it?
FOX
(smiling, with utter certainty)
Beagles love blueberries.
Fox and Kylie push through a bramble and climb to the top of
an elderberry bush. Fox looks through his binoculars.
20.
FOX (V.O.)
If we approach with the wind in our
faces, we'll smell the chicken livers on
Boggis' breath from at least fifty yards
away.
Seventy-five chickens stand around quietly but anxiously,
darting wildly nervous looks at one another. They eat bits of
grain off the ground.
FOX (V.O.)
Remember: they aren't very smart, but
they're incredibly paranoid -- so always
kill a chicken in one bite.
CUT TO:
Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now
drink whiskey sours. Fox repeats:
FOX
One bite, get it?
Fox waits for Kylie to respond. Kylie does not. Fox frowns.
FOX
Are you listening to me? I look into your
eyes and I can't tell whether you're
getting anything I'm saying.
Kylie stares at Fox vacantly. He shrugs.
(NOTE: an alternate set of eyeballs will be used for any
shots indicating Kylie's vacant look.)
Fox and Kylie move swiftly through the tall grass. Fox pauses
to sniff the air. He nods.
FOX
A few beagles, as we discussed, but we're
ready for that.
Fox and Kylie cross a dirt lane and come out of a shallow
ditch. Fox licks the pinky of his paw and holds it up in the
air.
FOX
You feel that? The wind's in our faces.
21.
Kylie touches his face with his paw. He nods. Fox and Kylie
run along the edge of the ditch. Kylie says casually:
KYLIE
Yeah, back in the old days, didn't they
used to do a thing where if somebody saw
a wolf, and --
FOX
(STARTLED)
What wolf?
Fox stops in his tracks. His eyes dart about. Kylie looks at
him curiously.
FOX
Oh, nothing? Never mind.
Fox and Kylie veer off into shorter grasses. Fox points
ahead, regaining his composure:
FOX
Here comes the low stone wall. Not a
problem.
Fox and Kylie climb over a low stone wall and find themselves
at the base of a chain-link fence eleven feet high.
FOX
This is a chain-link fence, I guess. Did
I not remember this? Maybe it's new.
Let's pause.
(SUDDENLY ANGRY)
What the cuss? Where'd this giant fence
come from? We had a master plan!
Kylie motions to a yellow, plywood lightning bolt posted to
the fence.
KYLIE
What's this lightning bolt stand for?
FOX
Give me a second! I said, "Let's pause"!
Pause. Fox pulls himself together. He turns to look at the
plywood lightning bolt.
FOX
That, I guess, hypothetically, could mean
maybe this fence might be electric.
22.
KYLIE
Well, I just hope it doesn't mean
thunder. I have a phobia of that.
Fox and Kylie climb a tree and crouch at the end of one of
its branches. Fox produces a zip-loc bag filled with
blueberries with white thread stitched into them.
FOX
Watch this.
Fox puts a blueberry into the end of a straw and shoots it
out into the barnyard.
CUT TO:
The blueberry landing on the ground in front of Chicken House
#1. A beagle approaches it and sniffs at it. He eats it. He
looks very pleased. He falls over, out cold.
CUT TO:
Fox with an ecstatic expression on his face. He rapidly
shoots more and more blueberries across the barnyard. Beagles
eat blueberries and fall over, one after another. Fox and
Kylie drop down into the barnyard and head for Chicken House
#1. Fox whispers excitedly as they run:
FOX
Beagles love blueberries! Didn't I tell
you? The master plan's working again!
Kylie raises his fist enthusiastically and trips over an
unconscious beagle. He picks himself up quickly, and they
weave among the rest of the beagles. They reach the entrance
to the chicken house, open the door, and duck inside.
Pause. There is an eruption of crazed squawking, screaming,
and fighting from inside. The chicken house rumbles. Lights
jolt on across the compound. An alarm goes off. Voices yell.
The chicken house door swings open again, and Fox and Kylie
emerge among a cloud of feathers. Fox carries two dead
chickens, and Kylie has one live one. Fox yells:
FOX
I said one bite, cuss it!
KYLIE
I'm trying! I have a different kind of
teeth from you! I'm an opossum!
23.
Kylie tries to bite the chicken on the neck. The chicken is
unharmed. Kylie shrugs. Fox kills the chicken with one quick
flick of the jaws. Kylie looks horrified.
KYLIE
That's so grisly! There's blood and
everything!
FOX
(DEFENSIVELY)
We're killing chickens! There's going to
be blood in this story! Follow me!
Fox and Kylie dash to the electric fence. They stop in front
of it. Kylie looks to Fox.
KYLIE
What's the master escape plan?
Fox hesitates, confused. A gunshot fires from among the
chicken houses. Fox shouts to Kylie:
FOX
Follow me again!
Fox and Kylie run back across the barnyard, past the beagles
as they begin to wake up and stagger around. Farmhands
appear, loading shotguns and running into the confusion. Fox
and Kylie race by, unnoticed, among them. They dart into the
house through a flap in the back door. The lights are out in
the kitchen. They take a moment, breathing hard in the
darkness. Kylie shakes his head in disbelief.
KYLIE
Wow. That was amazing. How did we do
that? We ran the other way or something.
FOX
Yeah.
KYLIE
What happens now?
FOX
I have no idea.
Fox opens the door-flap a crack. He looks out and sees Boggis
opening the front gate to let out his beagles and farmhands,
barking and shooting, as they search for the intruders. Fox
shouts to Kylie:
24.
FOX
Holy cuss! They opened the gate! Follow
me again!
Lightning quick, Fox and Kylie burst out through the door-
flap, race across the barnyard, and dart through the open
gate. Up the road, Boggis screams furiously as he runs with
his pack of beagles and farmhands. Fox and Kylie fly into the
bushes. As they race through the underbrush Fox says
BREATHLESSLY:
FOX
Let's hit the five and dime on the way
home! We need to make some fake price
tags and wrap these chickens in wax-paper
so it looks like we got them at the
butcher shop!
Fox and Kylie howl ecstatically.
MONTAGE:
A fox's paw lifts a silver dome off a perfectly roasted
chicken with an apple in its mouth.
Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at a candle-lit table eating chicken and
drinking wine. Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at a
slightly miniature table eating chicken and drinking milk.
Fox laughs hysterically as he tells his wife a story. Wine
comes out of his nose.
Fox and Kylie dash out the door of Boggis' Chicken House #7
carrying three more dead chickens. Lights jolt on. Farmhands
run out firing shotguns. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
cut into the electric fence.
Fox and Kylie dash out the window of Bunce's Poultry Barn C
carrying two dead ducks and a goose. Alarms ring. Farmhands
run out firing pistols. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
knocked into a brick wall.
Fox and Kylie dash out the gates of Bean's Apple Orchard XII
carrying two dead turkeys and a basket of apples. Automatic
doors close. Farmhands run out firing rifles. Fox and Kylie
escape through a hole chopped into a burning barricade.
Fox and Kylie run full-speed through a clover field in the
dark. The camera zooms in slowly on their faces as they ford
a stream, leap a fallen hawthorn, and cross into the willow
glade. They look exhilarated.
25.
Fox and Kylie walk among the trees. They are dressed in their
prowling outfits.
FOX
I spotted a couple of broken burglar bars
underneath the back door to Bean's secret
cider cellar.
KYLIE
We're breaking into Bean's house?
FOX
(HESITATES)
Cellar.
KYLIE
Where he lives?
FOX
(HESITATES)
Where he keeps the cider.
ASH
(BRIGHTLY)
Below where he lives.
Ash, dressed in his own prowling outfit, is walking with Fox
and Kylie. Fox stops short:
FOX
Where'd you come from? Go back to the
tree and do your homework!
ASH
I want to help you steal some cider.
27.
FOX
(ANGRILY)
We're going to a book party! And keep
your mouth shut about any cider, because
no one ever said that! Get out of here!
ASH
But Dad --
FOX
But nothing! You're going to get me in a
lot of trouble!
The three animals stand in silence for a minute. Fox points
to his tree. Ash turns and starts back home. Fox shakes his
head.
FOX
Where the cuss does that kid get off? Can
you believe that? How'd he get tipped
off? You think he's going to tell on us?
Fox turns to Kylie. Kylie looks back at him vacantly.
FOX
Before we go any further, from now on can
you give me some kind of signal once in a
while just so I know any of this is
getting through to you?
Pause. Kylie makes a slight motion with his paw. Fox
hesitates.
FOX
Was that it? OK.
Fox and Kylie dart across the yard and around the back of
Bean's farmhouse. Kylie whispers as they run:
KYLIE
One time this wolf --
FOX
(IRRITATED)
What's with all the wolf talk? Can we
give it a rest, for once?
Fox climbs onto a garbage pail and pulls open a window
shutter. He and Kylie shimmy in-between two bent burglar
bars.
28.
Bean is standing darkly in his front doorway. Smoke drifts
from the end of his Luger, pointed at the ceiling. A broken
light bulb hangs from a wire above his head. Boggis and Bunce
sit together on the porch in rocking chairs, startled,
staring at Bean.
BEAN
I'm going to give a speech, and at the
end of it -- I'm going to throw a twist
into this plot.
Bean lights a cigarette and begins to walk slowly around the
porch.
BEAN
First truth: this is the most ambitious
fox we've ever encountered, bar none.
Bean spins around and shoots out a second light bulb. Boggis
and Bunce look uneasy. Bean continues:
32.
BEAN
Second truth: the meaning of ambition is
defined in the dictionary.
Bean jumps and rolls and shoots out a third light bulb.
BEAN
Third truth: the weakness of the
ambitious man is his Achilles heel --
Bean quickly shoots out three more light bulbs behind his
back, over his shoulder, and between his legs. The porch goes
dark. He flicks on a flashlight and points it in his two
colleague's faces. They look scared. Bean says urgently:
BEAN
-- but I've already figured out where
this fox lives, and tomorrow night we're
going to camp in the bushes, wait for him
to come out of the hole in his tree, and
shoot the cuss to smithereens. How's that
grab you, fellas?
Boggis and Bunce hesitate. They nod and murmur their
approval.
Fox pokes his head up out of his hole. He sniffs once. He
moves an inch forward and stops. He sniffs again. He waits a
moment and listens. He steps out of the hole and says
STONILY:
FOX
Nice job covering for me. Next time
TRY --
A twig snaps. Fox freezes.
CUT TO:
Boggis, Bunce, and Bean frozen in the bushes.
CUT TO:
The branches of the trees as the wind suddenly changes its
direction.
CUT TO:
Fox on high alert. He rapidly sniffs the air three times in a
row. He turns to a confused Kylie and says, panicking:
FOX
All three!
Fox and Kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as
Boggis, Bunce, and Bean open fire wildly from the bushes. A
barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark.
Silence.
34.
Smoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air.
Boggis, Bunce, and Bean approach the tree. Bean shines his
flashlight on Fox's hole.
In the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered, blood-
stained remains of Fox's tail. Bean picks it up and holds it
in the air in front of Boggis and Bunce.
BEAN
We got the tail, but we missed the fox.
Pause. Bean takes out his walkie-talkie.
BEAN
Petey? You and the boys sober up and get
out here on the A.S.A.P. Bring eleven
shovels, three pick-axes, 500 rounds of
ammunition, and a bottle of apple cider.
The next morning. There is a large hole in the side of the
hill, under Fox's tree. The ceiling to the living room has
been completely removed. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand half-
underground with their heads sticking out of the hole,
breathing hard, with dirty shovels over their shoulders.
Bunce stands on Fox's tiny club chair.
BUNCE
These foxes dig like a bunch of
hyperactive gophers.
BOGGIS
Franklin? You got another twist for this
plot?
BEAN
Say that again?
BOGGIS
I say you got another --
Bean whips out his walkie-talkie and twirls it like a six-
shooter. He presses a button on it and says:
40.
BEAN
Petey? Get me the current contact info
for Earl Malloy on the A.S.A.P.
BUNCE
(INTRIGUED)
Who's Earl Malloy?
BEAN
(INNOCENTLY)
What? You mean over at Malloy
Consolidated? Oh, he does rentals.
BOGGIS
(PAUSE)
What does he rent?
CUT TO:
Three yellow and black, murderous, brutal bulldozer digging-
tractors with Malloy Consolidated painted on the sides of
them. They make a terrible, high-pitched growling noise and
spit black grease and smoke.
Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand among the tractors nodding
giddily to each other. They scramble into the drivers' seats
and begin ripping into the hillside. Bunce sits on a
dictionary to see over the dashboard.
CUT TO:
Fox, Mrs. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson digging
frantically.
CUT TO:
The tractors grabbing huge chunks of earth and tossing them
into the meadow. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, drunk with digging,
laugh manically as the controls of their tractors.
BEAN
Let's kick some fox cuss!
BUNCE
I'm cussing loving this!
BOGGIS
Who's hyper-cussing-active now?
Bean throws his tractor into top gear. The teeth of the giant
shovels clank against each other, ripping through the tree's
roots.
41.
INSERT:
A temperature gauge with its needle pushing the limits of the
red.
CUT TO:
A grizzled, white-haired man in a greasy yellow and black
jumpsuit and coke-bottle protective eyeglasses. A patch on
his pocket says E. Malloy. He watches the farmers digging
crazily with the tractors. Sparks from the mayhem reflect
dancing on his lenses.
EARL MALLOY
These machines weren't made to be handled
like this.
DISSOLVE TO:
The hill with half its earth dug out from under the tree. The
tree still stands precariously above the wild tractors.
DISSOLVE TO:
The hill now razed with the fallen, old beech tree laying on
its side as the tractors dig deeper.
DISSOLVE TO:
The tractors almost completely below ground in a deep crater.
A crowd of neighbors and local press from the town has
gathered and watches as the tractors stop digging and rumble
up out of the crater. The motors go quiet. Boggis, Bunce, and
Bean climb down from their tractors. They look angry and
tired. They stand among the workers and onlookers.
A television reporter with an Action 13 camera crew confronts
BEAN:
REPORTER
Farmer, correct me if I'm misreading the
data, you've successfully destroyed the
scenery, but the alleged fox remains at
large. What will you three prominent
farmers do now?
BEAN
Well, Dan, I can tell you what we're not
going to do. We're not going to let him
go.
42.
REPORTER
Are you concerned about the possibility
OF --
BEAN
I have no further dialogue in this scene.
Bean turns away from the reporter and pulls Boggis and Bunce
aside. He addresses them with calm intensity:
BEAN
I'm not going home until we smoke this
son-of-a-cuss out his hole, string him up
on a clothesline, and fly him like a
kite. Boggis, how many men have you got
working on your farm?
BOGGIS
Thirty-five.
BEAN
Bunce?
BUNCE
Thirty-six.
BEAN
And I've got thirty-seven. That's 108 men
altogether. Now what do I got here? Two
quitters -- or are you staying with?
CUT TO:
That night. A helicopter with a Bean, inc. decal on the side
of it circles the crater scanning the dark terrain with a
searchlight. There are tents, trucks, and 108 men gathered
around the perimeter. They sit on bricks and logs and are
armed with bats, pistols, rifles, shotguns, bows and arrows,
and hatchets.
There is a full moon. Lanterns glow in the farmers' tents. A
group of farmhands sit around a campfire next to the crater.
One of them cooks a chicken on a spit. Another sits on a log
playing a banjo. He is Petey. He sings:
PETEY
'Bout a handsome little fox
Let me sing you folks a yarn.
Hey, diddle-dee, doddle-do, doodle-dum!
'Twas a splendid little feller
Full of wit 'n' grace 'n' charm.
Say, zippy-zee, yappy-yo, google-gum!
The shot moves past the leathery faces of the other farmhands
as they listen: amused, moved, hungry, tired, charmed,
annoyed, whistling, playing a jew's harp, trying to sing
along but not really knowing the words, etc.
PETEY
Like any little critter needin'
Vittels for his littl'uns,
Well, he stole, and he cheated,
And he lied to survive.
Doodle-dum, diddle-die, doddle-diddle-
doodle-dee!
Zippy-zo, zippy-zay, zippy-zappy-
zoopy-zee!
(this verse is spoken:)
Let me take a little tick now
To color in the scene:
'Cross the valley lived three yokels
Name of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.
(MORE)
44.
PETEY (CONT'D)
(back to singing:)
Now these three crazy jackies
had our hero on the run.
Shot the tail off the cuss
With a fox-shootin' gun.
But that stylish little fox
Was as clever as a whip.
Dug as quick as a gopher
Who was a hyper-ack-a-tive.
Now those three farmers sit
'Twhere there's a hole 'twas once a hill.
Hey, diddle-dee, doddle-do, doodle-dum!
And as far as I can reckon
They're a-settin' up there still.
(SLOWLY)
Way, zippy-zee, yappy-yo, google --
BEAN
(INTERRUPTING)
What are you singing, Petey?
Petey stops short. Everyone turns quickly and sees Bean
standing over them in the darkness with his Luger in one hand
and a cigarette in the other. Petey looks nervous.
PETEY
I don't know. I was just kind of making
it up as I was going along...
Petey trails off. Bean shakes his head. He looks highly
irritated.
BEAN
That's just weak song-writing! You wrote
a bad song, Petey!
Bean throws his cigarette into the campfire. He storms away.
Petey turns to the other farmhands. Everyone looks
uncomfortable.
TITLE:
3 DAYS LATER (18 Fox-Days)
CUT TO:
Morning in the farmers' camp. The cook flips an egg on a
skillet. He puts it on a plate with bacon and hands it to
Petey. Petey asks him:
45.
PETEY
How long can a fox go without food or
water?
CUT TO:
The exhausted foxes and Kylie underground. Kylie says
QUIETLY:
KYLIE
Well, I can only answer as an opossum,
but I don't think I can last more than
another couple of hours before I get
completely dehydrated and starve to
death.
ASH
What's that?
Ash points. Everyone looks. A tiny hole appears in the wall
at the end of the tunnel. Dirt crumbles out of it -- and a
bit of metal catches a glint. Fox and his family watch,
frozen. A breath of air blows into the tunnel.
The flame on Mrs. Fox's lantern flickers once and goes out.
ASH STARTS:
ASH
Dad?
FOX
(WHISPERS SHARPLY)
Not a sound!
Silence. There is a sudden, loud scrabbling noise. A match
strikes. Fox touches it to Mrs. Fox's lantern-wick.
The tiny hole in the wall has become a large one. Badger
stands in front of Fox with his law partner Beaver, Beaver's
overgrown, hulking son, a medium-sized mole, and a grey field
mouse with a bandana tied in a "do-rag" style around his
head. Badger has a spoon in his hand. Fox and Badger erupt at
each other, screaming simultaneously:
FOX
You scared the cuss out of us!
BADGER
I told you not to buy at nine and a
cussing half!
46.
FOX
You don't just bang into somebody's
cussing tunnel!
BADGER
Are you cussing yelling at me!
FOX
You're cussing right I'm cussing yelling!
BADGER
We're all cussing starving to death
because of you, you mangy, cussing,
little cuss!
Fox and Badger snarl and scratch at each other, circling
around the hole. They calm down slightly. Badger continues:
BADGER
We've been digging in circles for three
days. Half the woods've been obliterated.
Nobody can get out. Right now my wife's
huddled at the bottom of the flint-mine
with Mrs. Mole, Mrs. Beaver, Rabbit's ex-
girlfriend, no food, no water, and twenty-
seven hungry, whining, starving, little
animal brats. This is a total cluster-
cuss for everybody!
Fox looks around the room at the entire gaunt, dirty,
emaciated assembly. Everyone stares at him angrily. He
swallows. The mole says softly.:
MOLE
I just want to see a little --
(SUDDENLY CRYING)
-- sunshine.
FOX
(PUZZLED)
But you're nocturnal, Phil. Your eyes
barely even open, on a good day.
MOLE
(ENRAGED)
I'm sick of your double-talk. We have
rights!
Beaver's son looms over Ash and Kristofferson in a muddy
alcove on the side of the tunnel. He pokes Ash in the chest
with the finger of his paw.
47.
BEAVER'S SON
We don't like you, and we hate your dad.
You're too snazzy. You dress like a girl.
You're creative. Now grab some of that
mud, chew it in your mouth, and swallow
it.
ASH
(scared and disgusted)
I'm not going to eat mud!
BEAVER'S SON
Cuss, yeah, you are.
Beaver's son grabs a handful of mud, smashes it into Ash's
mouth, and forces his jaws up and down in a chewing motion.
Ash coughs and splutters. Kristofferson frowns. He takes off
his shoes with his feet. He says with a quiet ferocity:
KRISTOFFERSON
Don't do that.
Beaver's son looks to Kristofferson. He looks down at
Kristofferson's feet.
BEAVER'S SON
Why'd you take your shoes off?
KRISTOFFERSON
So I don't break your nose when I kick
it.
Kristofferson kicks Beaver's son in the face, karate chops
his neck, elbow-jabs him twice in the gut, and flips the
enormous youth over his shoulder and into the mud. Beaver's
son gets up, crying, and walks out of the alcove.
Ash watches blankly with mud all over his mouth as
Kristofferson puts his shoes back on.
ASH
I can fight my own fights.
Badger and Fox stand facing each other at the end of the
tunnel. Badger says aggressively:
BADGER
Those farmers aren't going to quit until
they've got you and every member of your
family nailed upside-down to a bloody
stick with your eyes gorged out.
48.
FOX
(FREAKED OUT)
This is getting a little too personal.
Badger waits for Fox to continue. Fox stares into space.
FOX
Give me a minute.
Fox turns and walks away. He faces the wall of the tunnel. He
sits down on a rock. Everyone watches him uncertainly. They
look at each other. Badger starts to say something, but Kylie
cuts him off sharply:
KYLIE
(SHARPLY)
Shh!
Badger falls silent. Fox sits with his chin on his paw, lost
in concentrated thought. He stands up. He nods repeatedly and
begins to pace. His eyes dart from one spot to another. His
paws move abruptly around in the air drawing lines and
shapes. He freezes and looks straight up at the ceiling of
the tunnel. He snaps the fingers of his paw and looks to the
others. He says with a cautious excitement:
FOX
I've got an idea.
BADGER
(TENTATIVELY)
What is it?
FOX
It could be a good one.
BEAVER
(POINTEDLY)
Lay it on us.
FOX
It might save our lives.
KYLIE
(EXASPERATED)
Say the idea!
Fox looks down at Ash, who stands beside him with mud still
on his mouth. He nods. He says suddenly:
FOX
All right! Let's try it!
49.
Fox runs over to Mrs. Fox:
FOX
Go to the flint-mine. Tell Mrs. Badger,
Rabbit's ex-girlfriend, et al. that help
is on the way.
MRS. FOX
(SKEPTICALLY)
Is help on the way?
Fox grips Mrs. Fox's paw. He looks into her eyes and says
INTENSELY:
FOX
I sure as cuss hope so.
Mrs. Fox detects a special, familiar, inspired light in her
husband's eyes at this moment. She nods. She hands Ash the
lantern. She straightens the neck-line of his cape, licks the
mud off Ash's snout, and scrambles away down Badger's tunnel.
Ash wants to cry but does not. Fox turns to the others.
FOX
Gentlemen, this time we must dig in a
very special direction.
Fox feels the walls with his paws. Everyone watches
attentively.
FOX
I got to kind of feel out the vibe.
Fox stops. He points slightly downwards and due south. He
says with quiet anticipation:
FOX
Begin.
Everyone starts digging, slowly but intently.
CUT TO:
The diggers one hundred yards later. Fox suddenly whistles
and raises his fist.
The diggers stop digging. Fox feels the ceiling with his
paws. He knocks something hard. It sounds hollow. He looks at
the others with a funny expression and raises an eyebrow.
Fox carefully pushes up a floorboard. It creaks loudly. They
all duck down and wait. Nothing happens. Fox pushes up a
second floorboard. He cautiously pokes his head up through
50.
the gap. He lets out a shriek of excitement and whispers
excitedly down to the others:
FOX
I've done it! I've done it, first time!
Come up and see where you are, my
darlings!
Everyone scrambles up out of the tunnel.
A large fire truck drives up to the destroyed hill with
firemen hanging off the back and sides. It parks among the
tractors and tents. The chief, in a white helmet, goes over
to Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting at the mouth of the pit. A
patch on his sleeve says O.W.F.R.P.F. Farmhands and firemen
circle around.
CHIEF
Who's got me a donation for the old
Wounded Fireman's Retirement Pension
Fund?
Bean pulls a yellow check out of his inside pocket.
53.
BEAN
Right here.
(pointing behind him)
Let me show you this hole.
A bicycle messenger with a head-lamp rings his bell as he
approaches the farmers' camp. He stops in front of Bean and
hands him an envelope. Bean tears it open and unfolds the
letter inside.
INSERT:
70.
A note written in letters cut out of magazines and pasted
onto a piece of paper. It reads:
Dear Farmers Boggis, Bunce, and Bean,
I have no alternative but to agree to
your terms. Move the station wagon and
open the manhole cover below the foot of
the drainpipe next to the cobbler's shop
and meet me there today at 10 A.M. sharp.
I will hand myself over to you in
exchange for the boy's safe return.
Cordially,
Mr. Fox
Bean frowns. He studies the letter. He shows it to Boggis and
Bunce.
BEAN
Why'd he write this in letters cut out of
magazines?
BUNCE
(SHRUGS)
I don't know, but you did the same thing.
BEAN
(UNEASY)
I don't trust this guy. Anyway, set up
the ambush.
An old craftsman looks out from the window of Ferguson
Cobblers as he taps little nails into the heel of a loafer. A
station-wagon with wood-grain side-panels and a flat tire
sits parked on a manhole cover in front of the shop. Boggis,
Bunce, and five armed farmhands watch as Bean monkeys with a
slim-jim until he gets the car door jimmied.
Bean hops inside. He starts the engine, puts his arm over the
top of the seat as he looks back out the rear window, and
throws the station-wagon into reverse. The farmers clear out
of the way as Bean backs up off the manhole cover.
Boggis and Bunce stick tools into the manhole cover and lift
it open.
INSERT:
Rat's watch. It is now 10 A.M.
CUT TO:
Six armed farmhands on the roof of the Nag's Head Tavern.
CUT TO:
Seven armed farmhands in the bushes behind Sweetings Bakery.
CUT TO:
Eight armed farmers in the window of Harrison Travel.
CUT TO:
The Action 13 reporter and camera crew in an alley next to
St. John's Coin-op Laundry.
Boggis, Bunce, and Bean crouch behind the open doors of a
pick-up truck with three beagles. Boggis checks his carbine.
Bunce loads his shotgun. Bean cocks his Luger. Fox's voice
hollers from deep inside the manhole:
FOX (O.S.)
Did you bring the boy?
BEAN
Of course, we did! Say something, kid!
Bunce presses play on a tape recorder. Kristofferson's voice
comes over a loudspeaker:
73.
KRISTOFFERSON'S VOICE
Excuse me! Excuse me?
Bunce presses stop.
CUT TO:
Fox and his entourage at the bottom off the manhole. Fox
scoffs. He smiles and shakes his head.
FOX
Come on! That doesn't sound anything like
him! It's amateur night in Dixie!
Badger rapidly slaps two pieces of flint together. A bit
chips off, and sparks fly from the break. He blows on some
kindling. He takes a pinecone out of a basket.
A ribbon of white smoke rises out of the manhole. The three
farmers watch curiously as it thickens and turns black. Bean
frowns.
BEAN
What the cuss is he burning?
A blazing pinecone shoots out of the manhole and flies
through the air, over the farmers' heads. It lands in a trash
can and lights some rubbish on fire. A man with a dart in one
hand and a mug of ale in the other comes out of the Nag's
Head and pours his beer into the trash can. The fire goes
out.
The three farmers laugh smugly. Bean shouts:
BEAN
Is that all you've got, Mr. Fox?
Twenty-seven blazing pinecones shoot out of the manhole and
hit: a wood-pile on the roof of the Nag's Head, a box of
pastry wrappers in the bushes behind Sweetings, a stack of
brochures in the window of Harrison Travel, a hay bale in the
bed of the pick-up truck, Boggis, Bunce, Bean, and a crate of
cam-corder batteries next to the Action 13 camera crew, which
explodes. Farmers scatter, grabbing hoses, yelling, and
tamping out the flames as the beagles bark, yelp, and
scramble in the confusion.
Rabbit darts out of the hole and races up the street. Six
farmers chase after him, firing their weapons.
74.
Badger jumps out of the manhole and throws more blazing
pinecones at farmers, trucks, parked cars, doors, windows,
and the Action 13 camera crew. Seven farmhands chase him down
a cobblestone lane.
Weasel and Beaver climb out with straws in their paws and
start firing blueberries toward the disoriented beagles. The
beagles eat blueberries. They fall over. Eight farmhands
chase Weasel and Beaver up a wooded path.
Rickity, the field mouse, bounds out of the hole and leaps
into the fracas. He fires a rubber band at Bunce off a
paperclip. It snaps Bunce in the corner of his eye. Rickity
lets out a little whoop.
There is a small explosion and a burst of flames blasts from
the manhole. Fox and Kylie jump out and run over to a vehicle
with a tarp over it parked in front of Paddington Automotive.
Fox whips off the tarp, revealing a miniature motorcycle with
a sidecar.
CUT TO:
Fox driving the motorcycle with Kylie in the sidecar. They
both wear helmets and goggles. Thunder rumbles in the
distance. Kylie sinks lower in the sidecar. He shouts to Fox
over the sound of the motor:
KYLIE
Are you scared of wolves?
75.
FOX
Scared, no! I have a phobia of them!
KYLIE
Well, I have a thing about thunder!
FOX
(ANNOYED)
Why? That's stupid!
Ash pokes his head up from the rear compartment of the
sidecar. He also wears a helmet and goggles. His white cape
flutters behind him. He shouts:
ASH
I don't like needles!
Fox and Kylie look to Ash in disbelief. Fox says furiously:
FOX
Where'd you come from again? How'd you
get in the sidecar? I feel like I'm
losing my mind!
Fox angrily steers toward a small mound of dirt. They jump it
slightly and fly over a little ditch. Ash yelps
enthusiastically as Fox drives them back onto the road.
The Bean, inc. windmill spins briskly in the dusty winds.
Shutters on the farmhouse bang open and shut. Leaves rustle
on the branches of the apple trees. A few stray turkeys
wander in the yard. A white-washed brick pile six stories
tall sits apart from the other structures. The doors to its
courtyard are made of iron and painted yellow. This is Bean
Annex.
The front gates of the farm are open, and a gardener waters
vegetables next to the driveway. Fox, Kylie, and Ash look out
from a high branch over a reinforced concrete and barbed-wire
security barricade.
FOX
That's the annex over there on the right.
Ash nods. Kylie does not respond.
FOX
The white building over there on the
right.
Pause. Fox looks to Kylie.
FOX
Kylie?
Kylie turns to Fox and stares at him vacantly. Fox says
SHARPLY:
FOX
Kylie!
KYLIE
What?
(SUDDENLY)
I did it!
FOX
When? I didn't see it!
Kylie makes his slight gesture with his paw. The gardener
puts three turnips into a basket and rides away on his
bicycle.
Fox, Kylie, and Ash scramble down the tree trunk. They come
out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through the
gates, across the yard, past the wandering turkeys. They park
outside the courtyard doors to Bean Annex and jump off the
motorcycle.
77.
Fox climbs onto Kylie's shoulders and tries the knobs. They
are locked.
FOX
Kylie, you got a credit card?
KYLIE
(digging in his pockets)
Sure.
FOX
(IMPRESSED)
See, this is what I was saying about how
good you are at just being available for
WHATEVER --
Kylie hands Fox a World Traveler Titanium Card. Fox frowns.
FOX
A Titanium Card? How the cuss did you
qualify for this?
KYLIE
(SHRUGS)
I pay my bills on time. I've always had
good credit.
Fox examines the card with mild resentment. He picks the lock
and opens the doors.
The courtyard has high walls and a gravel floor. On one side,
there are ten trash cans, a stack of newspapers, and a
compost heap. On the other side, there is an old, rusted,
broken-down tractor and a new one. By far the largest,
fattest, toughest beagle yet lies sleeping in the middle.
White foam froths around its mouth as it breathes heavily.
Its collar is hooked to a thick chain. A tag around its neck
reads Spitz.
Fox, Kylie, and Ash stop in their tracks. The beagle opens
his eyes. Fox turns to Kylie.
FOX
Give me a blueberry.
Kylie looks surprised. He shrugs. He shakes his head and
gestures, I don't have any. Fox frowns. He throws up his
hands in the air. Kylie makes a frustrated face. Fox points
at him. Kylie looks away and snorts angrily. Fox looks away
and spits at the ground. Ash says quietly:
ASH
What's that white stuff around his mouth?
78.
KYLIE
(SQUINTING)
I think he eats soap.
Fox sees an amber, plastic pharmacy bottle on a shelf above
some bags of fertilizer. It's reads:
Drug: Phenomoxylcarbobubytol, 10 mg
NAME: SPITZ
BREED: BEAGLE
For: RABIES (chronic)
Other: Take with meat, do not operate heavy machinery
Fox frowns. He says grimly:
FOX
That's not soap.
KYLIE
(HESITATES)
Well, then why does he have that bubbly --
FOX
He's rabid. With rabies. I've heard about
this beagle.
The beagle stands up. Fox says carefully:
FOX
Easy, boy.
Fox takes a cautious step toward the beagle. He holds out the
back of his paw for the beagle to sniff. He says back over
his shoulder to Kylie and Ash:
FOX
I'm going to try to befriend him. I feel
like there's a tenderness in his eyes.
Fox takes another step. He makes a soft, kissing noise. The
beagle watches him calmly.
FOX
Yes, I'm right. He's a good boy. A little
lonely, maybe, but --
Fox takes another cautious step.
FOX
-- but terribly sweet. Hello, there, boy.
Is your name Spitz? That's German, isn't
it?
79.
KYLIE
(aside, to Ash)
I thought he said you never look a beagle
in the eye.
FOX
(COAXINGLY)
Why, you're just as sweet as a --
Fox and the beagle lock eyes. The pupils of the beagle's eyes
contract then completely disappear, and the whites turn
bright red. Fox's eyes open wider than their sockets.
The rabid beagle erupts ballistically, attacking like an
enraged maniac. His chain rips out of the cement. Fox, Kylie,
and Ash shriek and scream, sprinting frantically around the
courtyard as the rabid beagle, frothing, roaring, and
snapping, tries desperately to kill them. Fox shouts, his
voice cracking like a grandmother's:
FOX
Climb the trellis!
In well under a second, Fox, Kylie, and Ash scale the trellis
six stories -- Kylie's pants catching on a nail and ripping
off on the way up -- and find themselves standing on the roof
of Bean Annex. Kylie wears blue Fruit-of-the-Looms with a
pattern of stars, moons, and planets on them. They all look
down at the rabid beagle, which continues to pitch an insane
fit, running in circles after its tail at the bottom of the
courtyard.
Fox takes in their new surroundings. He says, pleased:
FOX
So the attic is probably in the area
right up around here somewhere, I figure,
huh?
Kylie and Ash, panting and dripping with sweat, both stare at
Fox vacantly.
(NOTE: a second set of alternate eyeballs indicating Kylie's
vacant look will be used for Ash in this shot.)
FOX
(IRRITATED)
Come on, guys. Stay with me. We did good.
That's just some dog. Let's not get
traumatized.
80.
Bean's helicopter lands on top of the Nag's Head. Fires
smolder and farmers continue to chase around after animals in
the village streets below. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, leaning
over and holding onto their hats, run to the chopper and
climb inside. They take off.
CUT TO:
The street below. An orange and yellow Citroen van screeches
into the melee. Painted yellow letters spell Badoit et Fils,
Destruction des Animaux Nuisibles on the side of it with an
image of a trapped fox.
An old man with a grey moustache and a young man with a black
moustache, both dressed in orange-and-yellow-striped
uniforms, jump out of the van. They open the side door and
start unloading stacks of metal cages.
CUT TO:
Rabbit still running full-steam down a country lane being
pursued by the six farmhands.
Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson come around the side of
the building. They run to their motorcycle, outside the
courtyard doors. They freeze.
The front gates to the compound are closed and bolted. Bean's
helicopter waits on top of the vegetable garden with its
rotar-blades whirling. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand in front
of Bean Annex with their weapons drawn.
Fox sees his tail around Bean's collar. His eyes narrow. His
jaw sets. He says to himself with growing emotion:
FOX
Your tractors uprooted my tree. Your
posse hunted my family. Your gunmen
kidnapped my nephew. Your rat insulted my
wife -- and you shot off my tail.
(STEELY)
I'm not leaving here without that neck-
tie.
Bean smiles his sickly smile. Fox smiles back defiantly.
Kylie looks utterly baffled. Ash says mystically:
ASH
I weigh less than a slice of bread.
FOX
(HESITATES)
What?
ASH
I'll be right back.
Ash runs. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson watch, shocked, as
Ash sprints back to the courtyard doors. The three farmers
open fire at him. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson duck and take
cover behind a hay-bale.
85.
Ash dodges bullets. He jumps off the balls of his feet with
his arms out over a sprinkler-pipe and swings like a gymnast
onto a clothesline, then flies through the air doing another
of his spectacularly awkward four-armed and three-legged back-
flips. He lands on the handle of one of the courtyard doors
AND SCREAMS:
ASH
Ki-ya!
Ash cyclone-chops the doorknob. The lock clicks. Ash's eyes
light up.
Ash drops to the ground. He digs a hole and burrows into the
dirt as bullets fly everywhere. He breathes in through his
nose and out through his mouth. Fox watches with his jaw
hanging open.
The courtyard doors smash apart and the rabid beagle tears
out into the vegetable garden growling, foaming, and
thrashing crazily. The farmers shriek and scream and run
around, panicking, with their guns blazing.
Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson jump onto their
motorcycle. The beagle rips the tail from Bean's neck, shreds
it, chews it up, and swallows it. Fox deflates for an
instant, then recovers. He looks to Ash on the back of the
motorcycle, behind him, with his hands around Fox's waist. He
says with the deepest affection and respect:
FOX
Ash, that was pure, wild animal
craziness. You're an athlete.
Ash swallows. He beams. He sits up straighter.
(NOTE: from this point onwards, an alternate version of Ash
will be used which is slightly taller, slightly leaner, and
animated slightly more gracefully.)
Fox kick-starts the motorcycle and races across the farm.
Boggis, Bunce, and Bean scramble onto the roof of a car port
with an old, white Mercedes convertible under it. The
snarling beagle barks and snaps below them. They watch as:
Fox steers the motorcycle toward a broken apple cart at the
edge of the property. He guns the motor and yells:
FOX
Holy swearing cuss!!!
86.
Fox races the motorcycle up the apple cart, into the air, and
over the concrete barricade. They land in the middle of the
road, skidding, and speed off down the hill.
CUT TO:
Boggis, Bunce, and Bean watching from the roof of the car
port. Boggis turns to Bean and says, deadpan, needling him:
BOGGIS
Franklin? You got any final twist for
this plot?
BEAN
(PAUSE)
Yeah!
Bean grabs Boggis by the neck and throttles him. Bunce starts
throwing punches. Bean holds him back by the forehead. Boggis
kicks Bunce in the stomach. They brawl chaotically while the
rabid beagle continues to go bananas below them.
CUT TO:
Each fox-trap with a cobblestone missing underneath it and a
hole in the ground. The old man with the grey moustache turns
to his son and says with a strong French accent:
BADOIT
Cuss.
Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson ride down a country road.
Kylie sees something across the meadow. He says warily:
KYLIE
Don't turn around!
FOX
What?
Fox turns around. A huge, wild, grey wolf with ice-blue eyes
stands on a rock fifty feet away from them. Fox slams on the
brakes. The motorcycle slides to a halt.
FOX
Where'd he come from?
(LOUDLY)
Where'd you come from? What are you doing
here?
Pause. Fox points toward the wolf:
FOX
Canis lupus!
Fox points to himself:
FOX
Vulpes Vulpes!
The wolf does not answer. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson
watch idling from the motorcycle.
FOX
I don't think he speaks English or Latin.
(LOUDLY)
Pensez-vous que 1'hiver sera rude?
(ASIDE)
I'm asking if he thinks we're in for a
hard winter.
88.
The wolf shakes his head. Fox nods.
FOX
He doesn't seem to know.
Silence. Fox shouts to the wolf with a strange hitch in his
VOICE:
FOX
I have a phobia of wolves!
The wolf does not answer. It breathes heavily with its mouth
open. Its teeth are long, sharp, and yellow. Its tongue hangs
out, and its eyes are wild. Fox looks back at it with the
identical expression for a minute, mesmerized -- then Fox
closes his mouth and his eyes soften.
Fox raises his paw in the air. The wolf blinks a few times.
It raises its paw in the air. It turns away and trots off
into the woods. Fox says wistfully:
FOX
What a beautiful creature. Wish him luck,
boys.
Fox guns the motor. Gravel spits from under the spinning
tires, and they tear off down the road. The shot booms down
into the ground, below the grass, through buried pebbles,
layers of soil, and subterranean mineral deposits.
TITLE:
THREE DAYS LATER (2 1/2 Fox Weeks)
The shot continues to descend past Badger and his family
having dinner in a nicely furnished drain-pipe, past Rabbit
and his family watching Magnum, P.I. on the stolen, portable
television set in a well-appointed cement tunnel, past Beaver
and Mrs. Beaver hosting Mole and Weasel for cocktails in a
tasteful sewer-conduit.
The shot stops in a small chamber adjacent to the brick
cavern. The walls are filled with electrical cables, wires,
pipes, and a large, new mural which depicts the Fox's former
view of the valley as seen from their tree with a trompe
1'oeil window-frame around it. It is signed Felicity Fox.
Ash and Kristofferson sit Indian-style meditating on a
braided rug. Mrs. Fox works mixing paints and turpentine at
an easel in the corner. There is an armchair with a folded-up
copy of the Gazette on its cushion in the center of the room
under a glowing lamp. Classical music plays on a radio.
89.
Fox swings his head into the room from a tunnel. He says
GENTLY:
FOX
My darlings?
Everyone looks to Fox. He signals them to follow him.
Boggis, Bunce, and Bean sit silently in folding metal chairs
around the manhole. Boggis's carbine rests across his lap.
Bunce's shotgun hangs from a strap over his shoulder. Bean
cleans his Luger. Petey sits on a cider box outside the Nag's
Head strumming his guitar in the background. The bartender
pulls the shutters shut and flips a sign on the door to
Closed. Petey starts singing his song as the credits roll.
The sun sets. The farmers sit waiting in the dark.
