        A scruffy-looking BOOM MIC GUY, DIRECTOR and camera crew 
      stand in front of a steel door.  They lazily lean against a 
      brick wall.

      The steel doors slams open.  A CRAZED WOMAN, runs wildly past 
      the camera crew holding her neck as blood oozes through her 
      fingers.  Despite her injury, she moves fast.

      Two uniformed cops, JOE STUBECK -- 30 s, working class -- and 
      BILLY WILBUR -- 20 s, cocky and aggressive -- barrel after 
      her through the open doorway, guns drawn. 

                                    STUBECK
                    Don t lose her!

                                  BILLY
                    Shit!

      The camera crew scrambles to get their gear ready in time to 
      follow.

                                  DIRECTOR
                    Don t just stand there, follow 
                    them!

      The cameraman whirls around sharply to follow the action. 
      Everyone chases the woman on foot...

      Down the sidewalk, past startled pedestrians.

      They turn a corner and follow the woman through a liquor 
      store. The cops yell at shoppers as they chase with guns 
      drawn through the store.

                                  BILLY
                    Get down!

                                    STUBECK
                    Down!

      They continue through a darkened back room, out the back door 
      into an alley. The woman runs as fast as she can, but turns a 
      corner right into a brick wall. Dead end.

      BILLY and Stubeck stops and raise their guns at the woman.                                                                                      2.


                                  BILLY & STUBECK
                    Freeze!

      She spins around violently.  Her eyes are wild, jaundiced and 
      sickeningly bloodshot.  She gnashes her teeth and screeches 
      at the cops.  She s a god damned zombie!

      Stubeck and Billy fire.  Blood, brains, and pieces of skull 
      splatter against the alley wall.  The woman drops to the 
      ground.  The camera whirls towards Billy and Stubeck.  They 
      slowly lower their sidearms and give the corpse a once over.

                                  BILLY
                    Hey, you see they had Choco Tacos 
                    back there?

                                    STUBECK
                    Hell, yeah.  You wanna get some?

                                  BILLY
                    Yeah.

      Billy and Stubeck turn toward the camera crew.

                                    STUBECK
                    Anybody want a Choco Taco?

      The Boom Mic Guy bends and vomits.

                                  BILLY
                    Not this guy.

                                    STUBECK
                    Anybody else want a Choco Taco?  
                    It s like a taco of ice-cream.  
                    It s good.

      ***NEW OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE


      Chryron:  1:19 a.m., Van Nuys


      Stubeck and Billy stand outside the door of a motel room, 
      guns drawn.  Stubeck kicks the door in, and the camera crew 
      rushes in after them.  They find NADIA, a vampire prostitute, 
      straddling a half-naked JOHN who s tied down to the bed.  He 
      has IV s in his arms, and blood is being slowly drained.

                                    STUBECK
                    Okay, everybody, hands in the air.

                                  BILLY
                    That means you, vampire tits.

                                    STUBECK
                    Really?  Vampire tits?

                                  NADIA
                    I wasn t doing nothing.

                                    STUBECK
                    Okay, Nadia, how many times are we 
                    gonna do this?

      The John fidgets uncomfortably in the bed. 

                                  NADIA
                    Come on, Stubeck, leave working 
                    girl alone.

                                  BILLY
                    You weren t working, you were 
                    humping this guy for blood.
                          (straight into camera)
                    Am I right?

                                    STUBECK
                    What are you doing? 

                                  NADIA
                          (in Russian)
                    Screw you, pig!

                                  BILLY
                    Sorry, I don t speak vampire.

                                    STUBECK
                    It s Russian, you idiot.  Come on, 
                    Nadia, you know the drill.  Hands 
                    behind your back.                                                                                    10.


      Stubeck starts to cuff Nadia.  The John squirms on the bed.

                                  JOHN
                    This isn t what it looks like.  I 
                    thought she was a regular 
                      prostitute. 

                                  BILLY
                          (mocking the John in a 
                            shrill voice)
                    I thought she was a regular 
                      prostitute.
                          (beat)
                    Are we in a cow pasture?   Cause I 
                    smell bullshit.

      Billy smiles at camera.

                                    STUBECK
                    Go check the bathroom.

                                  BILLY
                    I m going to go check the bathroom. 

      Billy gives the camera another cocky cop pose.

                                    STUBECK
                    I just told you to do that, so 
                    you re following an order right 
                    now.

                                  JOHN
                    So if I don t have sex, do I still 
                    have to give blood?


      Chyron:  3:35 a.m., North Hollywood


      Chyron:  4:04 a.m., North Hollywood

      Carla and John-John are still driving along.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                          (to the Director)
                    I m telling you, I got tons of good 
                      inventions.  I mean, when I was a 
                    kid I used to put water in a bottle 
                    and carry it around, I just never 
                    tried charging two bucks for it.

      Then, 

      The radio crackles.

                                  RADIO
                    Unit 23, unit 23, do you copy?

                                  CARLA
                    Officer Sanchez here.  I copy.

                                  RADIO
                    We have a report of a 1-11 in 
                    progress at Wigley s Donuts, 1327 
                      Chatsworth.  Please report, over.

                                  CARLA
                      Affirmative.  Officer Johnson and I 
                    are on route, over.

      John-Johm smiles.  He pulls brass knuckles out of his front 
      pocket and puts them on.

                                  DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                    What s a 1-11?

                                  CARLA
                      Slow-walker zombie. (*ADD) The 
                    fresh ones can move pretty well, 
                    but a 1-11 s been undead too long.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Wigley s Donuts, now that s what 
                    I m talking about.  I can go for a 
                    bear claw.  Hit the lights, baby.

      The lights and siren kick in and the car speeds away.                                                                                    17.



      Chryon: 4:36am Wigley s Donuts                                                                                    19.


      John-John is taking weapons out of the cruiser s trunk.  He 
      throws some nunchucks aside.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    No, not today.
                          (pushes sledgehammer away)
                    Too big.
                          (grabs an aluminum bat)
                    Oh, yeah, Daddy s angel.

                                  DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                    What s with the bat?

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Well, you know, when it comes to 
                    zombies I like to keep this shit 
                    intimate, if you know what I m 
                    sayin .

                                  DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                    Jesus, man, that seems a little 
                      dangerous!

                                  CARLA
                    I tell him that every night. 

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Yeah, what can I say?  I m a 
                    creature of habit. 

                                  CARLA
                          (pointing at the camera)
                    Well, everyone else, watch your 
                    back.  You get bit, you re done. 

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Yeah, well I don t think we have to 
                    worry about that.

      John-John laughs and points at the donut shop.  One fat, SLOW 
      MOVING ZOMBIE in shorts and a tank top is bumping mindlessly 
      against the donut racks inside.

                                  CARLA
                    Look at that fat bastard.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                          (mocking the zombie)
                    Hey, hey, hey. I m a zombie.  What 
                    kind of donut do I want?  Frosted?  
                      Sprinkles?                                                                                     20.


                                  CARLA
                          (mocking the zombie)
                    No, no no.  Brains!

      Carla and John-John laugh.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    That was good.

                                  CARLA
                    I know. (beat) Alright, lets get it 
                    over with.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Damn, I hate when it s that easy. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Stubeck, in jeans and leather jacket, stands at a large metal 
      door.  He takes one look back at an UNMARKED CAR parked down 
      the block, adjusts a button (mic) on the pocket of his jacket 
      and presses a BUZZER next to the door.  After a beat, a 
      buzzer sounds.  Stubeck pulls open the door and steps inside.


      Still screaming, Stubeck BURSTS OUT OF THE BUILDING and runs 
      down the street, passing Carla and John-John without a 
      glance.  They watch him go, then:

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    This shit is not under control.                                                                                    29.


      CLOSING STING

      Chyron: Next On


      STUBECK is undergoing a routine traffic stop.  He addresses 
      the camera as he approaches the car. 

                                    STUBECK
                    We deal with this all the time. 

      Stubeck approaches the pick-up with his flashlight out. 

      Behind the drivers wheel is a WEREWOLF.

                                  WEREWOLF
                    Good evening officer.

                                    STUBECK
                    Sir, I m going to need you to turn 
                    the truck off.

                                  WEREWOLF
                    Okay.

      The Werewolf gets out of the truck.

                                    STUBECK
                    Turning into a werewolf tonight?

                                  WEREWOLF
                    I am. I know how this looks, but I 
                    was at the library and I-

                                    STUBECK
                    You re clearly a werewolf right 
                    now.  You re halfway there, your 
                    shirts ripped up.  You ve got a 
                    hairy belly. 

                                  WEREWOLF
                    I was waiting for a computer.  I 
                    couldn t get online. 

                                    STUBECK
                    Well, you know the deal.  It s a 
                    full moon, you gotta lock yourself 
                    in.  So turn around, turn around 
                    and cuff him, okay?
                          (to camera)
                    He ll sleep it off, it s fine.

      The werewolf points.                                                                                    30.


                                  WEREWOLF
                    Officer did you see-

      Stubeck turns to look.

                                    STUBECK
                    What?

      The werewolf takes off in a dead sprint.  Stubeck chases 
      after him but at a much slower pace. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      An exhausted Stubeck walks out of a parking lot.

                    Okay, you re free to go.  He s free 
                    to go.  If they can run like that 
                    we let them go.  Whew!

                                                                          FADE OUT.
