      Chozen stands, taking it all in as the prison gates shut 
      behind him. He turns and walks into the sunset, his walk 
      turns into a Terminator run. He s screaming, he s free! He 
      slips and falls on his face.

                                                                BACK TO PRESENT:                                                                                      4.



      Tight on Chozen s hand signing the POSTCARD.

                                  CHOZEN (V.O.)
                    Warmest wishes, Chozen.

      The hands drops the postcard in a MAILBOX. Pull back to 
      reveal Chozen walking on WESTERN UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.

      TITLE CARD



      Chozen scales the wall of a DORM. He reaches a window and 
      awkwardly tumbles in. 



      Chozen alone on the bleachers with headphones and notebook, 
      writes, erases, writes more.



      Chozen writes as a SOCCER TEAM PRACTICES, the COLLEGE BAND 
      REHEARSES. The SUN FALLS IN THE SKY. 



      On Chozen writing, he keeps looking up, distracted. Pan to 
      the field to see a football team practicing.

      Shots of football player butts in slow-mo, bend over 
      stretching, etc.

      An older guy, JIMMY TWIST (Mid-Forties, longish Hair, 
      rocker), sits further down the bleachers, shooting photos. 

                                  JIMMY
                          (to himself)
                    There ya go, stretch it out 
                    darlin . Have fun with it. Nobody s 
                    watching.

      He sees Chozen, gives him a thumbs up. Chozen acts like he 
      didn t see him, goes back to writing.

                                  CHOZEN (*CUE 2)
                          (rapping to himself)
                    Dude creeping low key, trying be 
                    smooth. I cut him down to size, hit 
                    em  with the power move. One hand 
                    to the nuts, One hand to the neck.
                    Bout time homie learned respect. 
                    You shaking like a leaf, silly 
                    little trick. You picked the wrong 
                    dude if you was fixin to hit a lick 
                    quick. I m battle tested-

                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
                    Hey man! Hey!

      Chozen realizes someone is talking over his headphones, looks 
      up, pulls off headphones.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)

                                  JIMMY
                    Chozen for what?

                                  CHOZEN
                    Nah, that s my name.

                                  JIMMY
                    Oh, bad ass man. It s cool, just 
                    like- one word- easy to remember. 
                    Football fan?

                                  CHOZEN
                    Something like that.

                                  JIMMY
                    Not me, I m into cheerleaders. 
                    Young ones. Their panties, their 
                    boobs. Check it out.

      Shows Chozen the LCD on his camera: shots of cheerleaders 
      doing exercises. 

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    Ho ho, nip slip!

      Wide on the field, reveal cheerleaders at the far end.

                                  CHOZEN

                    No thanks, aint really my thing.

      Jimmy a bit vexed, notices Chozen s TATTOO- (on forearm)

                                  JIMMY
                    Cool tat, where d you get it?

                                  CHOZEN
                    Prison.                                                                                    12.


                                  JIMMY
                    Been there amigo. When Motley Crue 
                    says they need ass, you just start 
                    grabbing girls, you don t check 
                    ID s.

      Chozen lights up.

                                  CHOZEN
                    Motley Crue, damn, them boys was 
                    big! You in the business?

                                  JIMMY
                    I was. 20 years. Did it all. Bus 
                    driver, roadie, lights, pyro.

                                  CHOZEN
                    Pyro? That s tight yo, I love me a 
                    big presentation. What you doin  
                    here? 

                                  JIMMY
                    The rock and roll scene changed, so 
                    I moved on. All folks seem to like 
                    these days are skinny little twinks 
                    singing about how sad they are. I 
                    like my tunes to have power, ya 
                    know? Balls! 

                                  CHOZEN
                    I feel you on that man. I like my 
                    shits to have balls too.  

      Chozen gestures to the notebook.

                                  JIMMY
                    Ah, a songwriter huh?

                                  CHOZEN
                    An MC.

                                  JIMMY
                    Ya know, they have an open mic deal 
                    every weekend at the Study Hall bar 
                    down the street. I mean, if you 
                    need somewhere to play.

      Fired up. Chozen stands to leave.

                                  CHOZEN
                    Thank you Jimmy. This Study Hall 
                    sounds like the perfect spot to 
                    begin my rise to the top. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    13.

                                  CHOZEN (CONT'D)
                    The plan is all coming together. I 
                    will annihilate!

                                  JIMMY
                    Well, it s just an open mic.

                                  CHOZEN
                    I m gonna bounce, gotsta fuel up 
                    for this mission!  

      Chozen hurriedly makes his way down the bleachers.

                                  JIMMY
                          (calling after him)
                    I mean, anyone can do it. Like, 
                    anyone!

      Chozen can t really hear him, but he pumps his fist in 
      excitement.



      Chozen weaves through tables, tray piled with food. He spies 
      TROY (19, thin, geeky) at a table alone with a LAPTOP. Chozen 
      plops down next to him, a little too close.

                                  CHOZEN
                    Mmm Mmm, these fries is on point. 
                    What s crackin ?

      Troy ignores. Chozen points at the laptop with a french fry.

                                  CHOZEN (CONT D)
                    I need to use that. I ll give you a 
                    Salisbury steak.

                                  TROY
                    Thanks, but, I have a paper due in 
                    the morning.


      Chozen looks left and right and leans in close, intimidating.

                                  CHOZEN
                    I d hate to see your computer 
                    smashed up on the ground with 
                    macaronis and Salisbury juices all 
                    over it. That d be a waste of food, 
                    nah mean?

      Troy is scared. Chozen slides over his old MARKED UP 
      PUBLICITY SHOT OF PHRESH PHRIENDS, he circles Crisco and 
      Ricky.                                                                                    14.


                                  CHOZEN (CONT D)
                    Find these men.

                                  TROY
                    This is just a picture.

                                  CHOZEN
                    Indeed it is. Analyze this with 
                    your technology. Their facial 
                    patterns, iris constructions.

                                  TROY
                    I can t do that. 

                                  CHOZEN
                    I don t believe you.

                                  TROY
                    Can I just have their names?

      Chozen perks up.

                                  CHOZEN
                    Oh snap, that s all you need?

      Chozen starts writing the names on the photo. Looks up. 

                                  CHOZEN (CONT D)
                    Can you make musics with that 
                    thing?

                                  TROY
                          (sarcastic)
                    Uh, yeah.

      2 JOCK BULLIES walk up to the table. Troy cowers.

                                  BULLY #1
                    Well looky here, a little pussy and 
                    a big dickhead. How perfect.

      Bully #2 knocks Troy s drink to the ground. Chozen casually 
      gets up and in one fluid motion smashes the guys heads 
      together and pins them to the ground. He leans in to their 
      faces. 

                                  CHOZEN
                    I saw this fish first, don t y all 
                    be violating the code now.

      The jocks run away scared as hell. Chozen wipes himself off 
      and sits back down next to Troy.                                                                                    15.


                                  TROY
                    Wow, thanks man. Those guys mess 
                    with me every day. I m Troy.

                                  CHOZEN
                    I m Chozen. And yo, you ain t gotta 
                    worry about them fools no more. You 
                    with ME now. 

      Troy smiles, looks at the photo and begins furiously typing.

                                  CHOZEN (CONT D)
                    The way this works is, I save your 
                    ass from steak-dick jocks, and you 
                    do pretty much whatever I say. You 
                    feel me?

                                  TROY
                      Absolutely. Totes feeling you right 
                    now. Anything you need I got.

      Chozen giggles.

                                  CHOZEN
                    Don t count on it little man.

      Troy turns the computer screen to Chozen.

                                  TROY
                    Boom.

      Chozen looks at the screen, cracks a smile.

                                  CHOZEN
                    You gotta be shittin me.



      A BANNER: HAPPY BDAY BRANDON hangs from a tree. A GROUP OF 
      KIDS sit on the grass in front of a stage with a SIGN: KOOL 
      KIDZ. MUSIC STARTS, CRISCO (29, Still athletic, shaved head) 
      and Ricky (29, still looks exactly the same) run onto stage 
      wearing LEATHER BASEBALL JERSEYS AND CAPS with the KOOL KIDZ 
      LOGO. Ricky jumps behind the turntables. 

                                  CRISCO
                    Hey yo, can anybody tell me what 
                    time it is?

      Ricky, waves his hands, encouraging the kids to join.

                                  RICKY
                    I think it s time for a birthday!                                                                                    16.


                                  CRISCO
                    What, I can t hear you?!

                                  RICKY
                    A cool guy s birthday!

      Chozen peeks over the backyard gate. On the stage, Ricky and 
      Crisco are into their HORRIBLE SONG, exchanging lines.

                                  CRISCO
                    Hey yo Brandon, this is your 
                      celebration.

                                  RICKY
                    We re glad to be here, thanks for 
                    the invitation.

                                  CRISCO
                    No doubt this is a marvelous day.

                                  RICKY
                    Hanging with our friends, no 
                    school, all play.

                                  CRISCO 
                    But first things first, yo let s 
                    eat.

                                  RICKY
                    You need to have the dinner, before 
                    you get the treats.

      SONG STOPS, the guys freeze in a pose. BRANDON S MOM stands. 

                                  BRANDON S MOM
                    All right, time for hot dogs!


      All the kids CHEER.



      The backyard gate swings open and Ricky and Crisco step out.

                                  RICKY
                          (anxious)
                    We started a little slow that time. 
                    I hate when we do that. 

                                  CRISCO
                    Relax man, it was fine. Ayo, you 
                    peep Brandon s Mom? Bitch is fine. 
                    I ma hit that, you just watch.                                                                                    17.


                                  CHOZEN (O.S.)
                    Yuck.

      The guys turn, Chozen is posted up on the hood of a car. They 
      don t recognize him.

                                  CHOZEN (CONT D)
                    You can do better than that man, 
                    but I know how it goes. Sometimes 
                    that dick just be hungry.
 

                                  CRISCO
                    Take a hike freak.

      Crisco turns back to Ricky, ignoring Chozen.

                                  CHOZEN
                    Nah, hiking ain t my thing... 
                    Crisco.

      Crisco and Ricky look over again, stare for a beat. 

                                  RICKY
                    Choze?

      Chozen pops off the car and strides right up, face off style.

                                  CRISCO
                            (gobsmacked)
                    Damn.

                                  CHOZEN
                    What, you ain t recognize your old 
                    boy? I ain t surprised. Would have 
                    been nice if y all coulda visited a 
                    brother, returned a letter and what 
                    not.

      Crisco and Ricky are nervous, spooked, looking up and down 
      the street.

                                  RICKY
                    How d you find us?

                                  CHOZEN
                    I have my ways.  

      Off Ricky confused

                                  CHOZEN (CONT D)
                    The internet.                                                                                    18.


                                  CRISCO
                    We can t be talking out here man. 
                    The streets is watchin.

      Ricky spies a BLACK MINIVAN with BASS BUMPING slowly coming 
      down the street.

                                  CHOZEN
                    What you talking bout, this is a 
                    rich ass neighb-

                                  RICKY 
                    Hit the deck!

      Slow motion; Crisco and Ricky sprawl on the ground, hands 
      over ears. Chozen stands, confused.



      The sliding door of the minivan opens to reveal 2 TEENAGE 
      GUYS, One guy moons the crew while the other points and 
      laughs. Slow motion ends.

                                    TEENAGE GUY #!
                    Cool outfits nerds!!!

      The door of the minivan slams and they speed away laughing.



      Ricky and Crisco gingerly look up from the ground to see the 
      van gone. They get up, try to play it off.

                                  CHOZEN
                          (laughing)
                    What the hell was that? Y all got 
                    beef with some pimply ass 
                      teenagers? 

                                  RICKY
                    It s not like that. 

                                  CRISCO
                    False alarm yo. 

                                  BRANDON S MOM (O.S.)
                    Hey guys?

      The guys turn to see Brandon s Mom at the gate.

                                    JACOB S MOM
                    We re about to cut the cake.                                                                                    19.


      Jacob s Mom leaves, Crisco and Ricky pat down their jerseys, 
      adjust their hats, get ready for the show.

                                  CHOZEN
                    Look dudes, I ain t know what y all 
                    into but we gots to talk. If you 
                    can t do it here then meet me 
                    tonight at Chuck s.

                                  CRISCO
                    We ll think about it.

      Ricky end Crisco enter the gate, Chozen calls after them.

                                  CHOZEN
                    Be there suckaz, but be careful, 
                    watch out for them minivans! Ha ha, 
                    stupid.

      Chozen turns to leave and sees the kids in the minivan coming 
      by for another pass. The driver is laughing. Chozen sticks 
      his arm out and makes his hand into a gun. He mean mugs the 
      driver and points at him. We see the driver stricken with 
      fear, they speed off. 

                                  CHOZEN (CONT D)
                          (to himself)
                    That s right.





      Chozen walks towards the dorm with the stuffed bears, he has 
      a brown bag bottle of booze, he s hammered. He drunkenly 
      mumbles to himself. He kicks the bears into A FOUNTAIN. 

                                  CHOZEN (*CUE 4)
                          (drunk rapping to himself)
                    Sometimes yo friends let you down, 
                    Take your dreams, and smash em  on 
                    the ground. What do I do, turn the 
                    page? 


      WE SNAP INTO THE MUSIC VIDEO IN CHOZEN S HEAD. THE BEARS TURN 
      INTO MUSCLED OUT DUDES WHO HIP HOP DANCE. HOOCHIES BLAST 
      CHAMPAGNE. CHOZEN SNAPS THE NECK OF ONE OF THE BEAR-MEN.


                    Uh uh, hell no I m goin  channel my 
                    rage and spit, rhymes of horror, 
                      unspeakable things, from deep 
                    inside me the darkness sings Murder 
                    murder, sex sex, murder murder, 
                    murder murder, sex...

      Back to reality. Chozen is in the fountain, humping one of 
      the bear dolls. It s head falls off. A few kids on the steps 
      of the dorm get up and run off.



      Chozen walks disheveled, drunk, eyes puffy, BOTTLE in hand, 
      CIGARETTE DANGLING. You can tell he hasn t slept. He comes 
      upon a line of kids. He follows the line to a record store.



      The windows of the store are plastered with a huge photo of 
      Phantasm, SIGN reading  DA NEW ALBUM: HOT PLAYA, OUT NOW.  
      Chozen cuts the line and walks in.                                                                                    29.



      Chozen dumps his booze in the smoothie cup, drops the bottle 
      to the ground with a SMASH. A few steps down the street he 
        nonchalantly drops the shiv in a storm drain.





      Chozen walks through campus. His shirt looks like it s been 
      puked on and the front of his pants are soaked. He passes a 
      Sorority car-wash. Girls in bikinis, soaping up cars, frat 
      guys drinking.

                                   JIMMY(O.S.)
                    Mmm, hmm, just a little more soap. 
                    There it is!

      Chozen looks to some bushes and sees half of Jimmy s head 
      sticking up. 

                                  CHOZEN
                    Hey Jimmy.

                                  JIMMY
                    Shhhh, be cool man, don t ruin my 
                    spot. Come here!

      Chozen heads over to the bushes, crouches down with Jimmy.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    Check these out.

      Jimmy turns the camera towards him. Shots of soapy girls.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    Moist sorority chonch dot net. I m 
                    gonna make a killing!

      Chozen, despondent, can t be bothered with the camera.

                                  CHOZEN
                    Cool, I guess.

                                  JIMMY
                    Someone shit in your Wheaties?

                                  CHOZEN
                    Worse. 2 guys, 1 girl, 3 shits 
                    total. My old crew punks me out, 
                    and then my sister be talking about 
                     losing her faith in me.  So here I 
                    am, drinking an alcoholic smoothie, 
                    hiding behind a bush with a grown 
                    ass man. Normally this would be a 
                    cool thing, but right now it sucks.

                                  JIMMY
                    Well, what are you going to about 
                    it besides act like a pussy?                                                                                    32.


                                  CHOZEN
                    I m gonna play the show tonight, 
                    that s what.

                                  JIMMY
                    Ha, not like this you re not. It 
                    looks like you got into a fist 
                    fight at a bukkake party.

      Chozen drunkenly scans his clothing. Sniffs his shirt, pulls 
      back at the stench.

                                  CHOZEN
                    You think you could help me out?

                                  JIMMY
                    I could, but that s a manager s 
                    job. I ve always been more of a 
                    road hog, ya know?

                                  CHOZEN
                    I ll give you my sister s meal card 
                    for a week.

                                  JIMMY
                    Deal! Let s get to work.

      MONTAGE:

      Jimmy and Chozen walk through the mall with bags.

      Jimmy helps Chozen set up Facebook and Twitter. 

      Jimmy messes around with FIREWORKS and little explosions 
      behind the dorm, Chozen cheers.

      Jimmy hosing Chozen down outside.

      Chozen in barbershop chair, tight on SCISSORS CLIPPING HAIR. 

      We see a hand place a NOTE on a table. 

                                  CHOZEN (V.O.)
                    Yo Tracy, I m sorry I let you down. 
                    You was right, a girl needs her big 
                    brother.

      The hand lays out JOLLY RANCHERS around the note in a frame.

                                  CHOZEN (V.O.)
                      I shouldn t have rented all them 
                    movies either. It s just Channing 
                    Tatum, dude is magnetic, I can t 
                    get enough.                                                                                    33.


      A  DEAR JOHN  DVD is placed next to the note, a few jolly 
      ranchers around it.

                                  CHOZEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Enjoy these candies and this  Dear 
                    John  movie disc. Hopefully it will 
                    touch you as much as it touched me. 
                    Be at the Study Hall tonight! 
                    Feelings, Chozen.

      We follow as a pair of NEW RED SNEAKERS leave the room. As 
      the door shuts pan up to reveal Tracy s empty dorm room.

      END MONTAGE



      Patrons loiter outside the bar. Muffled noise.



      The crew outside, just finished. Troy throws them beers from 
      his backpack.

                                  CRISCO
                    Man, you see how hype we got them 
                    fools? That one bitch was straight 
                    moist son!

                                  RICKY
                    Just like back in the day.

                                  CHOZEN
                    No doubt fellas, that felt damn 
                    good. I was dying up there without 
                    my squad. 


      The guys do a GROUP HUG DANCE THING like teams do before a 
      game.

                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
                    Hey! Y all wanna stop prancing 
                    around! It s time to get lit! 

      The guys look up to see Jimmy s head poking out of the bar, 
      Tracy and Troy are with him, waving. 

                                  CHOZEN
                    Word!

      Chozen, Troy, Crisco, and Ricky walk towards the bar. We 
      follow from behind.

                                  RICKY
                    Who s that guy?

                                  CHOZEN
                    That my dudes is our new manager.

      We hold from behind as the guys walk to the bar door, 
        conversation becoming unintelligible. Pan over to a BLACK 
      LIMO with the window half way down, PHANTASM. The window 
      slides up.
