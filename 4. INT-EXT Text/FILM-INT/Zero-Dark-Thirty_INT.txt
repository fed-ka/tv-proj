DANIEL
I own you, Ammar. You belong to me.
Look at me.
This is DANIEL STANTON, the CIA's man in Islamabad - a big
American, late 30's, with a long, anarchical beard snaking
down to his tattooed neck. He looks like a paramilitary
hipster, a punk rocker with a Glock.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
(explaining the rules)
If you don't look at me when I talk
to you, I hurt you. If you step off
this mat, I hurt you. If you lie to
me, I'm gonna hurt you. Now, Look
at me.
His prisoner, AMMAR, stands on a decaying gym mat, surrounded
by four GUARDS whose faces are covered in ski masks.
Ammar looks down. Instantly: the guards rush Ammar, punching
and kicking.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Look at me, Ammar.
Notably, one of the GUARDS wearing a ski mask does not take
part in the beating.
2.
SUPERIMPOSE: CIA BLACK SITE - UNDISCLOSED LOCATION
Ammar, bruised from the beating, is restrained with ropes.
Maya stands a few feet behind Daniel, attentive, wary of
what is to come. This is her first interrogation and she is
on the verge of vomiting from the stench in the room. She
looks around at the sound-proofed walls, the puddles of water
on the floor.
DANIEL
Right now, this is about you coming
to terms with your situation. It's
you and me, bro. I want you to
understand that I know you, that
I've been studying you for a very
long time. I could have had you
killed Karachi. But I let you live
so you and I could talk.
AMMAR
(RESISTANT)
You beat me when my hands are tied.
I won't talk to you.
DANIEL
Life isn't always fair, my friend.
Did you really think that when we
got you, I'd be a nice fucking guy?
AMMAR
You're a mid-level guy. You're a
garbage man in a corporation. Why
should I respect you?
DANIEL
And you're a money man. A paperboy!
Daniel paces around Ammar, anger rising.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
A disgrace to humanity!
(MORE)
4.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
You and your uncle murdered three
thousand innocent people. I have
your name on a five-thousand dollar
transfer via Western Union to a 9/11
hijacker.
He leans into Ammar's ear. Uncomfortably close.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
And you got popped with 150 kilograms
of high explosives in your house!
AND THEN YOU DARE QUESTION ME?!
And then Daniel smiles, laughs. Mercurial.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
I'm just fucking with you.
Beat. He laughs again.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
I don't want to talk about 9/11.
What I want to focus on is the Saudi
group.
Daniel shows him a photo.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
That there is Hazem al-Kashmiri.
And I know this dude is up to some
serious shit, and what I want from
you is his Saudi email.
(PAUSE)
Feel free to jump in.
(PAUSE)
Ammar, bro, I know that you know
this dude, just give me his
email...and I will give you a blanket.
I will give you a blanket and some
solid food.
No response from Ammar. Daniel starts putting on his gloves.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
I know that you know him.
AMMAR
I told you before, I won't talk to
you.
DANIEL
Have it your way.
(MORE)
5.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
(to the masks)
Let's go.
It all happens in a flash: in one swift motion, Daniel pushes
Ammar to the floor, the guards pin his limbs, and Daniel
smothers Ammar's face with a towel.
Ammar thrashes. Daniel considers his next move.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
(TO MAYA)
Grab the bucket.
Maya follows Daniel's gesture to the corner of the room,
where there's an ICE CHEST filled with WATER and a PLASTIC
PITCHER.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Put some water in it.
She dips the pitcher in the water, hands shaking.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
C'mon, let's go.
The stress and strain on her face is enormous as she brings
the bucket back to Daniel.
Daniel starts pouring the water on Ammar's face, which is
now covered by a towel. Ammar thrashes with rising panic.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef,
you guys met in Tunisia back in the
70s.
AMMAR
(gasping for breath)
I don't know, you asshole.
Maya shakes her head "no."
MAYA
That's not credible.
AMMAR
(SCREAMING)
Why are you doing this to me?
DANIEL
You're a terrorist, that's why I'm
doing it to you.
6.
AMMAR
Fuck you.
Daniel pours water over the towel so it hits Ammar's nose.
DANIEL
I want emails of the rest of the
Saudi group. Give me emails of the
rest of the Saudi group! Give me
one email, and I will stop this!
Ammar doesn't speak. He can't.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Who's in the Saudi group, and what's
the target? Where was the last time
you saw bin Laden? WHERE WAS THE
LAST TIME YOU SAW BIN LADEN?
Daniel throws the pitcher, rips the rag off Ammar's mouth:
and water spurts out - Ammar nearly drowned. He gasps for
air.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
This is what defeat looks like, bro.
Your jihad is over.
Daniel stands.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Get him up.
The guards bring Ammar to his feet.
Daniel, shifting his persona yet again, touches Ammar's face
and speaks to him with the comforting tenor of a therapist.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Try to understand the concept here.
I have time, you don't. I have other
things to do, you don't.
(BEAT)
It's cool that you're strong. I
respect it, I do. But in the end,
everybody breaks, bro. It's biology.
Dan and Maya exit.
They've learned nothing.
CUT TO:
Descending the lobby staircase with Daniel is JOSEPH BRADLEY,
Chief of Station, Pakistan, a smooth, vain, sophisticated
former case officer who hasn't quite buffed all the blood
out of his fingernails.
BRADLEY
How did it go the other night?
DANIEL
It was good. The local cops need
tactical help. But he's Tier fucking
One, baby. There's your money maker.
BRADLEY
This is the guy that's KSM's nephew?
What's his issue?
DANIEL
He's being a dick.
BRADLEY
If he's trying to outsmart you, tell
him about your PhD.
DANIEL
I am going to have to turn up the
heat. He needs to give us the Saudi
group now.
They reach the lobby, where they can see Maya sitting in the
holding area. They walk towards her as Bradley considers
what Daniel is asking for.
8.
BRADLEY
He's gotta have that - given the
family ties.
Permission granted, Daniel reassures his boss.
DANIEL
Tight with his uncle, prints all
over the 9/11 money.
Daniel knocks on the glass for Maya to come in.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
(to Bradley, clocking
her good looks)
Was I lying or what?
The guard opens the door and Maya comes through - not many
females come through that door.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
(TO MAYA)
Maya, this is Joseph Bradley, our
illustrious station chief.
(as they shake hands)
Joe and I did Iraq together.
BRADLEY
And we continue our Christian mission
here. Nice to meet you.
MAYA
You too, Sir.
BRADLEY
How was your flight?
They walk down the lobby towards the Secure Wing.
MAYA
Fine.
DANIEL
She's been having a great time ever
since she got in, isn't that right?
BRADLEY
How do you like Pakistan so far?
MAYA
It's kinda fucked up.
9.
BRADLEY
You volunteered for this didn't you?
MAYA
No.
Bradley smiles. He knew she didn't volunteer.
They reach a secure area and Bradley checks Maya through an
electronic door.
BRADLEY
(TO MAYA)
Third floor, northeast corner.
She goes through and Daniel and Bradley watch her walk away.
DANIEL
Don't you think she's a little young
for the hard stuff?
BRADLEY
Washington says she's a killer.
DANIEL
The children's crusade.
BRADLEY
They want the next generation on the
field. Listen, I have a meeting
with ISI in twenty minutes.
DANIEL
They're slow rolling us in Lahore -
you might want to bitch about that.
BRADLEY
Did you see the cable from London?
DANIEL
Dude, I've been in a dark room with
another man for the last two days.
CUT TO:
Maya finds her desk. It's covered with grime. She tries to
clean it as best she can, then sits and looks at the blank
log-in screen of her computer.
A group of thirty-somethings filing in for a meeting,
chatting, comradery, taking seats around a conference table.
10.
We will get to know:
JACK, mid-40s, a scruffy teddy bear, the liaison from the
National Security Agency (NSA).
JESSICA, 30s, an experienced targeter, and the only woman in
the station who wears a skirt.
JACK
Some dude tells the Malaysian station
that his nephew works with a guy who
knows a guy--
JESSICA
Here we go.
JACK
Hold on - He goes to a big feast in
Bangkok about a year ago. The guest
of honor? Usama bin Laden.
Laughter in the room.
JACK (CONT'D)
So I say, was Tupac there too?
JESSICA
Right, but you forgot - you forgot
Mullah Omar.
J.J. and JEREMY, two case officers, continue the banter:
JEREMY
(SARCASTICALLY)
This is worth 5 million bucks.
J.J.
You know we're going to have to chase
it down.
JEREMY
That's me, man. No job too small.
JACK
That's why I have a gift for you, my
friend.
Jack hands Jeremy a piece of paper. Daniel and Maya enter,
a little late.
DANIEL
Everyone, this is Maya. Maya,
everyone.
(MORE)
11.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Please don't ask how it's going with
Ammar because she's not going to
fucking tell you.
JESSICA
Ammar is withholding?
Daniel nods.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
(reading from her
FILE)
Washington assesses that Abu Faraj
is officially our new number three -
JESSICA moves to a wall chart of AQ leadership and repositions
Abu Faraj's mugshot to number three in the line, two down
from Usama bin Laden. Meanwhile, in the background, the
riffs continue -
DANIEL
- Best man for it.
JACK (O.S.)
London station is already asking if
we think he's in contact with anyone
in the U.K.
JEREMY
Like we're just keeping it from them.
Jessica sits back down and gets down to business.
JESSICA
The Jordanians are being really
helpful with Ammar's transit papers.
Jessica passes Daniel a file.
DANIEL
Any imminent threats in here?
JESSICA
They want the Consulate, the Marriott,
it's low security. And they've got
Majid Kahn talking about gas stations
in the US.
DANIEL
And that's a conversation?
Jessica shrugs. At this point, she believes that it is merely
a conversation - not a fully realized plot.
12.
JESSICA
Honestly? There are six hundred
questions in there. I'd concentrate
on Heathrow. The Saudis. Does it
matter what Faraj thinks about
Heathrow? How much latitude does he
get to pick targets?
DANIEL
I think he'll give up the Saudis.
But Heathrow is gonna be tough.
Anyway. Anything from last night?
J.J.
Quetta base thinks they have a bead
on the Arabs that escaped, and they're
going to meet with the ISI this
afternoon, hopefully to set up a
raid down there.
DANIEL
Great.
JEREMY
And Lahore reporting ISI down there
was painfully slow last night. Again.
I'm beginning to think it's not
incompetence.
DANIEL
I agree, I spoke to the Chief about
that. Anything on bin Laden?
JESSICA
(reading from a cable)
A farmer on the Afghan border near
Tora Bora reports: a diamond shaped
pattern in the hills, tall male in
the center of the diamond, flanked
by four guards. It's consistent
with UBL's movements.
JEREMY
That's supposed to be his royal guard?
MAYA
That's pre-9/11 behavior.
Jessica doesn't appreciate the challenge.
JESSICA
(CHILLY)
We don't have reason to believe he's
changed security tactics.
13.
MAYA
We invaded Afghanistan. That's a
reason.
And so the rivalry begins.
J.J.
Hey, boss, I got a guy for five
thousand bucks, he can set up a taxi
stand and snoop around a bit.
DANIEL
No, don't need him, the diamond
sighting is bullshit. See if the
Paks will send someone to talk to
the farmer. Anything else? We need
to be putting runs on the board
against Faraj. Speak to the case
officers who didn't see fit to make
it today. And thank them.
The loud WAILING of the early morning call to prayer from
the loudspeakers of a nearby mosque wakes Maya on the couch.
CUT TO:
Daniel and the guards enter Ammar's cell with Maya. Daniel
switches on a floodlight, awakening Ammar.
DANIEL
Let's take it easy today, huh?
Daniel hands Ammar a bottle of orange juice and a bag of
falafel.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Hungry? The food in here sucks so I
got you some of this.
Ammar grabs the lunch sack and scarfs down the falafels.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Richard Reid, wow. I was thinking
about him. The guy gets a bomb in
his shoe on a plane. Unbelievable.
You know him, don't you?
Slowly, Ammar nods.
14.
AMMAR
Yes.
DANIEL
I'm glad you said that. I have an
email from you to him. I've had all
your coms for years, bro. Who else
is in your Saudi group?
AMMAR
I just handed out some cash for them.
I didn't know who the guys were.
DANIEL
When you lie to me, I hurt you.
AMMAR
Please.
DANIEL
I believe you. I do, I believe you.
Beat.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Do you want the water again, or do
you want something else?
AMMAR
Please.
DANIEL
Just give me a name.
AMMAR
I DON'T--
Daniel jumps up.
AMMAR (CONT'D)
I don't know.
Daniel kicks out the chair from under Ammar. The masked
guards walk to the rope pulleys.
DANIEL
You see how this works? You don't
mind if my female colleague sees
your junk, do you?
Daniel pulls down Ammar's pants. Maya flinches at the bare
nakedness.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Dude, you shit your pants.
15.
Daniel turns to Maya -
DANIEL (CONT'D)
You stay here, I'll be back.
Daniel goes out, leaving Maya standing alone in front of the
naked, chained man.
Ammar looks at her imploringly and she struggles to meet his
eyes.
AMMAR
Your friend is an animal. Please,
help me. Please.
A long beat.
MAYA
You can help yourself by being
truthful.
The door handle turns. It occurs to Maya that perhaps Daniel
was testing her resilience, too, as Daniel re-enters with a
DOG COLLAR in his hand.
DANIEL
This is a dog collar.
Daniel unhooks Ammar, snaps the collar and leash around his
neck, as Ammar cries out against the humiliation.
Maya flinches. Daniel is relentless:
DANIEL (CONT'D)
You determine how I treat you.
Now Daniel drags Ammar on all fours, pulling him by the leash.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
I'm going to walk you.
Maya watches in horror as Daniel walks Ammar to a far corner
of the room, then leans down to address his victim:
DANIEL (CONT'D)
What the fuck do you think is going
on, Ammar? Wahleed has already told
me that you know.
At last, Daniel reaches an area of the room where there is a
large wooden box resting on a platform.
16.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
This box sucks. I'm going to put
you in it.
Ammar tries to speak but can't get a word out.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
When is the attack?
AMMAR
(VERY SOFTLY)
Sunday.
DANIEL
Sunday? Sunday where? This Sunday
or next Sunday?
Ammar mumbles, almost inaudibly.
AMMAR
Monday.
DANIEL
Is it Sunday or Monday?
Ammar doesn't answer. The masked men approach.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Which day is it? Partial information
is treated as a lie.
AMMAR
Saturday.
Beat. The masked men open the box.
AMMAR (CONT'D)
Sunday!
The guards grab Ammar and carry him to his wooden tomb. He
shouts with his last reserve of energy:
AMMAR (CONT'D)
Monday!
DANIEL
Ammar, which day?
AMMAR
(MUMBLING)
Monday, Tuesday,
Beat.
17.
AMMAR (CONT'D)
Thursday.
Beat.
AMMAR (CONT'D)
Friday.
Daniel slams the box shut. Once again, he's learned nothing.
CUT TO:
- The man enters the hallway of the KHOBAR RESIDENTIAL TOWERS
- And immediately opens fire on TWO WESTERN MEN he happens
to find inside, killing them both.
TITLE OVER: MAY 29, 2004
- The CRACK of the shots sends the rest of the residents
into a panicky, screaming dash for cover
- As he strides quickly down the hall, he finds three other
RESIDENTS scrambling for safety, and shoots and kills them
all.
CUT TO:
CU TV: news footage of the massacre.
Daniel, Jessica, and Maya look on in defeat. The "Saudi"
attack they tried to prevent by pressuring Ammar has occurred.
JESSICA
(TO DANIEL)
Don't worry about the Saudis, they'll
take care of business.
DANIEL
Yeah, now.
18.
JESSICA
You warned them - they didn't take
you seriously - this is what happens.
It's not on you.
DANIEL
Who said that? Zied? Fuck him.
This is on me. Ammar is on me!!
And it's on her!!
(pointing to Maya)
We can't let this be a win-win for
AQ.
JESSICA
No, no, no. You had - what - days -
brief custody - and an unresponsive
ally. The way you do this is you
look ahead. London. Heathrow. Mass
casualties. That plan is still
active.
MAYA
Ammar doesn't have a clue about what
happened.
JESSICA
He knows.
MAYA
How?
JESSICA
You have to be really careful with
people in KSM's circle - they're
devious.
MAYA
He's not going to talk about attacks
on the homeland. He's going to
withhold operational details on the
KSM network and probably on bin Laden.
(flipping her argument)
But he's been in complete isolation,
he doesn't know we failed. We can
tell him anything.
DANIEL
Bluff him?
MAYA
He hasn't slept, Dan. He's clueless.
CUT TO:
19.
We fade into a dimly lit research room, where Maya is alone
watching interrogation video recordings on an array of
monitors. Some of the videos are rough; but most simply
depict two people talking. The video she's watching now shows
a hooded prisoner sitting in a filthy room, the walls smeared
with red stains.
CU SCREEN:
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
You and I are gonna talk about some
of the guys in the training camps,
yeah?
The prisoner sits in a chair. He's hooded, but relaxed.
22.
PRISONER
Ok.
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
Some of these brothers have done
some bad things, and what I want to
do is I want to separate them from
the people like you.
PRISONER
Definitely, yeah.
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
There was a guy called Abu Ahmed
from Kuwait.
PRISONER
Yes, I remember him. A nice guy.
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
How close was he? What was his
relationship to the leadership?
PRISONER
I don't know.
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
Did he eat with you guys - did he
eat with the good guys - or did he
eat with the leadership?
PRISONER
I don't know, sir. I have no idea
about things like that.
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
Yes you do, you don't need an idea
ABOUT THINGS-
Maya hits pause and we see that her desk is filled with open
windows of interrogations: she is analyzing ten videos
simultaneously, comparing them to each other.
She plays another video showing a Turkish prison.
TURKISH INTERROGATOR
When you met with Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed, was this one of the
facilitators?
The Interrogator flashes a picture. The prisoner moans.
23.
TURKISH INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
Is this Abu Ahmed?
PRISONER
Yes.
CUT TO
She fast forwards a video - shot in a Polish facility. The
prisoner appears to be cold.
INTERROGATOR
KSM, your boss.
PRISONER
Mukhtar?
INTERROGATOR
Mukhtar,'potato', you say 'potahto'.
I say 'fucking KSM', but yeah,
'Mukhtar.' After Mukhtar was
captured, what did Abu Ahmed do?
PRISONER
Abu Ahmed, I believe he went to work
for The Sheikh.
Maya is still in the research room. She's been going at
this for hours and looks fatigued.
CU SCREEN: a different INTERROGATOR from the previous video;
PRISONER is an older man chained to a desk. The exchange is
in Arabic with an English subtitle on the screen:
PRISONER
In Karachi, in 2003 or 2004.
INTERROGATOR
He was carrying a letter from bin
Laden?
CUT TO:
Still going, looking exhausted now, Maya manipulates the
controls of yet another video clip with a different
INTERROGATOR and PRISONER. We're now in a Moroccan facility.
The interrogator shows him a photograph of a bearded man.
Henceforth, The Photograph.
24.
INTERROGATOR
Is that him?
PRISONER
(NODS)
Abu Ahmed.
The interrogator holds The Photograph right in front of the
prisoner's face, allowing us to see it as well.
INTERROGATOR
Say again?
PRISONER
Abu Ahmed. Abu Ahmed. Abu Ahmed.
Freeze frame.
CUT TO:
A Yemeni prison - the dialogue is a mix of French and English:
INTERROGATOR
Abu Ahmed - is he the courier for
bin Laden?
PRISONER
Who knows who works directly for bin
Laden? Let's say he's part of the
mix.
INTERROGATOR
Were there other people who carried
messages from bin Laden?
PRISONER
Sure.
INTERROGATOR
How many other people?
PRISONER
(THINKING)
Four or five.
INTERROGATOR
Let's talk about them--
The image freezes.
Maya stares at the screen.
25.
Maya is in the kitchen grabbing something to eat.
Jessica, the only other person working this late, walks in,
pours herself some coffee.
JESSICA
How's the needle in the haystack?
MAYA
Fine.
JESSICA
Facilitators come and go, but one
thing you can count on in life is
that everyone wants money.
The rivalry is in full bloom. Sometimes it's friendly.
Sometimes it's not so friendly.
MAYA
(SMILING)
You're assuming that Al Qaeda members
are motivated by financial rewards.
They're radicals.
JESSICA
(BIGGER SMILE)
Correct. You're assuming that greed
won't override ideology in some of
the weaker members.
MAYA
Money for walk-ins worked great in
the cold war, I'll give you that.
JESSICA
Thank you.
MAYA
Just not sure those tactics are
applicable to the Middle East.
CUT TO:
Maya hastily throws her clothes and a wig into a suitcase -
the world's fastest packing job -
CUT TO:
26.
At first we don't recognize the woman with heavy makeup
walking down the narrow corridor, and then we realize it's
Maya in disguise.
She enters a vast cavernous hold accompanied by a middle
aged Afghan man, thick shouldered with years of hard
experience in his kind, somewhat sad eyes.
This fatherly man is HAKIM, a former political prisoner in
Afghanistan and one of the CIA's most important assets.
In the galley, a PRISONER is chained to a table. Hakim slides
him The Photograph. The prisoner speaks in Arabic.
HAKIM
(TRANSLATING)
He says he looks like Abu Ahmed.
MAYA
Who did he work for?
Hakim translates. Then the prisoner speaks.
HAKIM
(TRANSLATING)
It was mostly with Abu Faraj - they
were always together.
MAYA
What did he do for Faraj?
HAKIM
(TRANSLATING)
He carried messages from Faraj to
bin Laden and from bin Laden back to
Faraj.
Maya leans into Hakim -
27.
MAYA
We need to ask him something to see
if he's telling the truth. We don't
know if he really knew Faraj.
Hakim speaks to the prisoner.
HAKIM
He just told me the names of all of
Faraj's children. I think he's
telling the truth.
CUT TO:
Maya is pitching Bradley in his office. Bradley sits with
his feet up on his desk, holding The Photograph.
Daniel is slouched on the couch in back.
Jessica is perched on the arm of the couch, bare legs crossed.
Bradley notices.
Maya stands.
MAYA
Twenty detainees recognize that photo
of Abu Ahmed. They say he's part of
the inner circle of guys who were
hanging out in Afghanistan pre-9/11.
(BEAT)
A lot of them say that after 9/11,
he went to work for KSM.
(BEAT)
When KSM got captured, he went to
work for Abu Faraj, primarily as a
courier from Faraj to bin Laden.
BRADLEY
Well, that's good. You still-
MAYA
Yeah, we don't know if Abu is on the
outside of the network - part of a
series of cutouts and dead drops -
or if he has a direct connection to
bin Laden. Does bin Laden invite
him into the living room and hand
him a letter directly? Or is Abu
just the last guy in a long line of
couriers, so that's why everybody
knows him?
28.
BRADLEY
That's not all you don't know. You
don't have his true name, and you
don't have a clue of where he is.
MAYA
We know that he's important. The
fact that everybody's heard of Abu
Ahmed but nobody will tell me where
he is suggests that.
BRADLEY
Maybe. Detainees could withhold his
location for any number of reasons.
Perhaps they don't know; perhaps
this Abu is just a cover story and
he's really a fucking unicorn. The
withholding doesn't reveal what you
want it to - does it?
MAYA
No.
BRADLEY
And if you did find him, you don't
know that he'd be with bin Laden.
DANIEL
We don't know what we don't know.
BRADLEY
(TO DANIEL)
What the fuck is that supposed to
mean?
DANIEL
It's a tautology.
BRADLEY
(back to Maya)
Listen, not one single detainee has
said that he's located with the big
guy, just that he delivers messages.
Am I wrong?
MAYA
No.
BRADLEY
No. It's still good work.
(MORE)
29.
BRADLEY (CONT'D)
Let me know when you've got some
actionable intelligence, preferably
something that leads to a strike.

Joseph Bradley sits at his desk. The weight of the world on
his shoulders.
On the television in the background, the news report
continues, showing disaster footage of PEOPLE bloodied,
screaming.
CUT TO:
HASSAN GHUL, Al Qaeda financier, sits manacled to a desk.
MAYA
I had you picked up instead of killing
you because you're not a violent man
and you don't deserve to die.
GHUL
Thank you.
31.
MAYA
But you do have deep ties to Al Qaeda
that I want to ask you about before
you get sent to your next location,
which might be Israel.
Ghul looks ashen.
MAYA (CONT'D)
However, depending on how candid you
are today, I may be able to keep you
in Pakistan.
GHUL
What do you want to know?
MAYA
I'm going to ask you a series of
questions based on your knowledge of
Al Qaeda and your position as key

GHUL
I have dealt with the mukhabarat, I
have no wish to be tortured again.
Ask me a question, I can answer it.
MAYA
What can you tell me about Atiyah
Abd al-Rahman.
GHUL
He works for Zawahiri. He's in charge
of military tactics.
MAYA
In what context have you ever heard
the name Abu Ahmed?
GHUL
He works for Faraj and bin Laden.
He is his most trusted courier.
Maya works hard to hide how pleased she is to have this
confirmation. She's not entirely successful.
MAYA
What makes you say that?
GHUL
He brought me many messages from the
Sheikh.
32.
MAYA
Where did you last see him, and where
is he now?
GHUL
You will never find him.
MAYA
Why is that?
GHUL
Even I couldn't find him. He always
contacted me out of the blue. He is
one of the disappeared ones.

POLICEMAN.
PAKISTANI POLICEMAN

You know how this works?
The man is terrified.
PAKISTANI POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
Just act naturally.
The Policeman finishes securing the bomb, and sends the man
out the door (who we will later deduce is Abu Faraj's
courier).
CUT TO:
Daniel and the guards take Faraj to a cell laced with barbed
wire and lock him inside.
DANIEL
Can I be honest with you? I'm bad
news. I'm not your friend. I'm not
gonna help you. I'm gonna break
you.
Beat.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
I've done it before.

Hey, wake up. You haven't eaten in
18 hours, we've got to keep your
energy up. You hungry?

Guards force feed Faraj through a feeding tube.

Bradley approaches Maya at her cubicle.
BRADLEY
You're in luck, I got you a one-on-

MAYA
Seriously? Thank you.
BRADLEY
Don't thank me until you hear what I
want for it.
He drops a folder on her desk.
BRADLEY (CONT'D)
I want you to take care of all of
this before your favorite subject.
MAYA
Deal.
BRADLEY
Don't you want to see what's in the
folder?
MAYA
You want family ties, financial
networks, media sources, disgruntled
employees, imminent threats, homeland
plots,
BRADLEY
(WALKING AWAY)
Thank you.
MAYA
Foreign cells, health status, trade
craft, recruiting tactics -- anything
else?
CUT TO:
Both Maya and Faraj look tired. This has been going on for
hours.
MAYA
A lot of brothers told us Abu Ahmed
was bin Laden's courier and that he
worked very closely with you.
35.
FARAJ
You're thinking of Abu Khalid.
MAYA
Who?
FARAJ
Al Buluchi. My courier for the
Sheikh.
MAYA
Okay, so you're telling me that all
the other brothers are wrong, and
there's some famous Buluchi guy that
is working for you and bin Laden
that I've never even heard of?
FARAJ
Why should you have heard of him?
MAYA
What does this Buluchi guy look like?
FARAJ
Tall, long white beard, thin. He
uses a cane.
MAYA
Kind of like Gandolf?
FARAJ
Who?
MAYA
When was the last time you saw him?
FARAJ
A month ago, in Karachi, but I don't
know where he is now. Sometimes I
wouldn't even see him, he would just
tell me where to leave the messages.
MAYA
I don't believe you.
The GUARD in the room with them leans forward and SLAPS Faraj
across the face.
Faraj's expression doesn't change and Maya herself remains
flat and steady, unmoved by the violence.
She's not quite the same young lady she was a few years ago.
36.
MAYA (CONT'D)
You're not being fulsome in your
replies.
FARAJ
You can't force me to tell you
something I don't know.
MAYA
You do realize this is not a normal
prison. You determine how you are
treated, and your life will be very
uncomfortable until you give me
information I need.
The guard slaps Faraj again. Faraj is impassive.

Okay.
JESSICA
Look, I know Abu Ahmed is your baby,
but it's time to cut the umbilical
cord.
MAYA
No, it's not.
JESSICA
So Faraj went south on you - it
happens. There are still cells in
London and Spain planning the next
round of attacks.
MAYA
I can work on it at the same time -
plus I think it's a good thing that
he lied.
JESSICA
No, not at the expense of protecting
the homeland, you can't. Wait a
minute, why is it a good thing?
MAYA
You sound just like Bradley. He
doesn't believe in my lead either.
(MORE)
40.
MAYA (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
It's a good thing because the fact
that Faraj withheld on Abu Ahmed is
revealing. The only other thing he
lied about was the location of bin
Laden himself. That means Faraj
thinks Abu Ahmed in as important to
protect as bin Laden. That confirms
my lead.
JESSICA
Or it's confirmation bias.
(BEAT)
We're all just worried about you,
okay? Is that okay to say?
Maya rubs her eyes, not liking where the conversation is
going. She forces a smile.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Where's Jack?
MAYA
He's probably stuck in some check-
point somewhere.
JESSICA
You two hooked up yet?
MAYA
Hello, I work with him. I'm not

unbecoming.
JESSICA
So? A little foolin' around wouldn't

Bradley has just finished watching the video. Maya and
Jessica are in his office waiting for his verdict.

JESSICA
He's right there in the inner circle.
BRADLEY
I don't buy it. Didn't you tell me
yourself nobody turns on Al Qaeda?
JESSICA
The Jords worked him for a year.
Dinners, money. They've convinced
him that it's his patriotic duty to
turn on Al Qaeda and get rich doing
it.
BRADLEY
Yeah, so the Jords say.
MAYA
(TO BRADLEY)
You're right. We can't rely on the
Jords. We have to evaluate him face
to face.
JESSICA
(CATCHING ON)
He may not be that smart. He may be
full of shit - but we have to talk
to him to find out.

The key is to meet him so we can

He really asked for a dialysis

Can't or won't?

JESSICA
He's not going to travel - security

The TV interview with Obama reaches the subject of enhanced

Then they continue:

He wants us to go to him. He'll
meet in Miram Sha or the tribals.
MAYA
He knows we're white. You'll get
kidnapped up there.
DAVID, an analyst, adds his two cents to the conversation -
DAVID
We could do it somewhere else -
Germany, or the UK? He's got a clean

JESSICA
He's not going to travel out of Al

JESSICA (CONT'D)
So far, everything he's said we've
cross checked and it's proved legit...
and I think the money is persuasive.
25 million dollars?! That buys a
new life.
JOHN
Do you think he might be exaggerating
his access?
JESSICA
Possibly. But Al Qaeda needs doctors
and they are short staffed and that
could explain his rise. In six months
to a year, if he doesn't fuck up, he
could be called in to treat bin Laden.
And at that moment, with 25 mil on
the table, I think he gives up the
Big Man. And if he doesn't, we kill
him.

And we are failing. We're spending

defeating our enemy.

GEORGE (CONT'D)
They attacked us on land in 98, by
sea in 2000, and from the air in
2001. They murdered three thousand

they've slaughtered our forward

Sitting alone at her desk we find Maya just as she's finishing
a report. She gets up, crosses the room and goes to the
desk of a young woman who reminds us in her idealistic
enthusiasm of the way Maya was six years ago. This is DEBBIE.
DEBBIE
Hi. I painstakingly combed through
everything in the system and found
this.

She hands Maya a file.
DEBBIE (CONT'D)
It's him. He was one of ten names
on a watch list sent to us by the
Moroccans after 9/11: Ibrahim Sayeed.
They told us to watch out for him,
apparently they think his whole family
and extended family is bad and has
ties to KSM.

He was picked up for fake papers and
a doctored exit visa leaving
Afghanistan, traveling through Morocco
en route to Kuwait. Abu Ahmed al-
Kuwaiti. This must be Abu Ahmed.
MAYA
Doesn't matter, but I wish I had
that five years ago. How come I
never saw it before?
DEBBIE
Nobody saw it, most likely. There
was a lot of white noise after 9/11,
countries wanting to help out, we
got millions of tips and...
(SHRUGS)
Things got lost in the shuffle.
Human error.
Maya turns her attention back to the WHITE BOARD and as Debbie
keeps talking we follow Maya's gaze across the row of MUG
SHOTS of Al Qaeda personnel. While a few of the men are
African or are distinctive looking for other reasons, most
of them look fairly similar in that they're all wearing the
same type of clothes and have the same trademark long gnarly
beards.
DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Anyway I thought you should know
about it.

I just want to say I've heard a lot
about you. You inspired me to come

Dan, Debbie found Abu Ahmed!
DANIEL
Fuck. Really?
MAYA
(OVER SPEAKER)
He was in the files this whole time.
The family name is Sayeed.
DANIEL
Ok, but he's dead. So doesn't that
make him a little less interesting
to you?
MAYA O.S.
He may not be. We now know that Abu
Ahmed is one of eight brothers. All
the brothers in the family look alike.
Three of them went to Afghanistan.
Isn't it possible that when the three
eldest brothers grew beards in
Afghanistan, they started to look
alike? I think the one calling
himself Abu Ahmed is still alive.
The picture we've been using is wrong.
It's of his older brother, Habeeb.
He's the one that's is dead.
DANIEL
Okay, what are you basing this on?
MAYA
We have no intercepts about Abu Ahmed
dying.
(MORE)
55.
MAYA (CONT'D)
We just have a detainee who buried
somebody who looked like Abu Ahmed.
But if somebody as important as Abu
Ahmed had died, they'd be talking
about it online in chat rooms all
over the place. Plus, the detainee
said that Habeeb died in 2001. We
know that Abu Ahmed was alive then,
trying to get into Tora Bora with
Ammar. That means it's probably one
of the other brothers that's dead.
DANIEL O.S.
In other words, you want it to be
true.

How come you haven't deployed a team

LARRY
For one thing, it's dangerous. For
another, the area is too congested

Look, if he talks about an operation,

I'll get on him. Okay?

No. Not okay. Look, Abu Ahmed is

You just want me to nail some low
level Mullah-crack-a-dulla so that
you can check that box on your resume
that says while you were in Pakistan
you got a real terrorist. But the
truth is you don't understand
Pakistan, and you don't know Al Qaeda.
Either give me the team I need to
follow this lead, or the other thing
you're gonna have on your resume is
being the first Station Chief to be
called before a congressional
committee for subverting the efforts
to capture or kill bin Laden.
BRADLEY
You're fucking out of your mind.
MAYA
I need four techs in a safe house in
Rawalpindi and four techs in a safe
house in Peshawar. Either send them
out or send me back to DC and explain
to the Director why you did it.
CUT TO:
Maya, despondent, sits at the bar, drinking a beer.
64.
Jack approaches.
JACK
Fuck the mom, we got the man himself.
Jack puts a cell phone down on the counter.
JACK (CONT'D)
Yesterday your caller bought himself
a cell phone. And every time his
phone rings -
(he taps the cell
PHONE)
- This phone will ring. Did I hook
you up?
Maya throws her arms around him.
MAYA
I love you!
CUT TO:
We focus on a MAP of Pakistan on the wall. Maya is indicating
neighborhoods in Rawalpindi. She's briefing Bradley, Hakim,
Larry and a few other people.
MAYA
It would be convenient for him to
drop tapes off if he's sending either
from bin Laden or from an
intermediary. When he wants to make
a call, he leaves the house, walks a
few blocks, then switches on the
phone. We need to keep canvassing
the neighborhood until we find him.
65.
LARRY
We got a shooter!
Larry tries reversing but a compact car wheels in right behind
them, and Larry slams on the brakes. The TECH raises an M4.
TECH
We're blocked.
HAKIM
Let me talk to them.
HAKIM
They said white faces don't belong
here. If they don't move, shoot
them.
A tense beat while the men stare, then finally leave.
On a large wall map, Maya circles "Peshawar" in red.
CUT TO:
In the backseat, the Computer Tech is getting tossed around,
trying to hang onto the Geo Locating device in his lap. The
Geo Locator starts to BEEP - a blinking red light.
66.
COMPUTER TECH
He's east of us. Try the market.
The congestion thickens. They slow to a crawl.
The SUV, stuck in traffic. Can't move.
Larry leaps out of the car and heads into an open air market -
Jack and Maya click through the tracking maps on her computer
screen.
67.
JACK
Lahore street, which is also in Pesh,
thirty minutes. Wazir Bag Road,
five. Nishterabad, five. Phandu
Road, five minutes, the Grand Trunk
Road, forty five seconds. There's
no pattern. Sometimes he calls every
two weeks - sometimes every three -
there's no consistency - I can't
predict when he's gonna make another
call because the guy's erratic.
MAYA
Do you think its intentional?
JACK
It might be. Maybe it just looks
erratic to us. I just can't tell.
Wearing a black burkha, Maya walks into her house and sinks
into the couch. She pulls off the head covering but doesn't
bother to remove the burkha. She switches on the TV. If
you didn't know her better, you'd think she'd gone native.
The PROTESTERS have blocked the embassy check point. It's
going to take a long time to get through.
REPORTER (O.S.)
He's been receiving death threats
after being named publicly in a
lawsuit by the family of a victim of
a U.S. drone attack.
68.
LATER
Maya and Bradley and several other STAFFERS watch the protest
through a window -
MAYA
ISI fucked you. I'm so sorry Joseph.
It's the first time she's addressed him by his first name.
Startling, to hear kindness in her voice.
Joseph turns to reply then thinks better of it and walks
away.
CUT TO:
Larry's minivan chugs through the crowded markets.
TECH
Still on tower three! Five. Signal
getting stronger. Ten!
Larry continues driving straight down the main road.
TECH (CONT'D)
Fifteen. Ten. Signal's getting
weaker.
(PAUSE)
We lost him - no signal.
LARRY
Heading South.
The van passes horse-drawn carts, men on cell phones, fruit
stands. The Tech studies his screen.
69.
TECH
He's up at five again. Fifteen.
Twenty.
(PAUSE)
Weaker now, he's shifted. We're
back to five. I don't get it.
LARRY
He's driving in circles.
Larry now drives very fast back to the main road.
LARRY (CONT'D)
No change?
TECH
No.
MAIN ROAD
And now Larry stops in the middle of the market.
LARRY
Let's hope he comes back around.
Beat.
TECH
Twenty. Thirty. Forty! Fifty -
we're within ten meters of him.
Larry scans the street - sees a half dozen guys on cell
phones.
TECH (CONT'D)
He's really close.
LARRY
Look at the cars. He's in a vehicle.
Larry spots something:
LARRY (CONT'D)
The guy with the phone in the white
SUV.
They snap a photograph of a WHITE POTAHAR SUV.
LARRY (CONT'D)
Is that him?
TECH
Could be.
70.
LARRY
You got him?
TECH
I got him.
LARRY
I'm breaking off -
The grey minivan pulls away.
CUT TO:
Larry's photograph of the WHITE POTAHAR SUV plops on Maya's
desk.
MAYA
Is this what I think it is?
LARRY
The guy you've been looking for, geo-
located on his cell phone in his
white car.
MAYA
Thank you!
LARRY
If you're right, the whole world's
gonna want in on this, so you gotta
stick to your guns now.
CUT TO:
The new Chief of Station, TIM ALEXANDER, barely looks up
from his desk as Maya enters.
ALEXANDER
(INTO PHONE)
I'm amazed that you're still here.
(looks at his watch,
INTO PHONE)
When can we grab lunch?
He sees that Maya, who hovers annoyingly over his desk, isn't
gonna wait.
MAYA
I need a picket line along the GT
highway and men spaced at intervals
along the road and at every exit.
71.
ALEXANDER
Maya, I know -
MAYA
So you agree with me now. This is
important?
ALEXANDER
No, I've just learned from my
predecessor that life is better when
I don't disagree with you.
CUT TO:
MAYA (V.O.)
Obviously this assumes he doesn't
change vehicles.
Maya at her desk working and we realize that she has been
typing all this in a cable she will email to Washington.
CUT TO:
- Bullets spider webbing the glass as Maya slams the car
into reverse -
Maya shakes inside her vehicle.
MAYA (PRE-LAP)
(PROTESTING)
Any American in Pakistan is a target,
they don't necessarily know I'm CIA.
CUT TO
MORNING
ALEXANDER
Doesn't matter. You're on a list.
Next time there might not be
bulletproof glass to save you.
MAYA
Yeah.
ALEXANDER
And you, of all people, should know
that once you are on their list, you
never get off.
(PAUSE)
We'll keep up on the surveillance,
as best we can.
CUT TO:
The Langley Predator Bay is an impressive sight, a command
center bristling with high-tech equipment. The room is filled
with TECHNICIANS. George is in the center, where he belongs,
directing traffic. People come up and give him new pieces
of information.
The big screen displays a single image:
The overhead satellite image of the compound in Abbottabod.
74.
SUPERIMPOSE: PREDATOR BAY - CIA HEADQUARTERS
From the back of the room, Maya enters, and watches the
activity unfold without her... without her input.
George notices her, gives a thumbs up and then turns back to
his troops.
STEVE, early 40s, a senior manager and one of George's top
deputies, joins Maya.
STEVE
Basically we had a guy who rolled
with Al Qaeda and did services for
them. We lost him for seven years
and now we found him again -- and
boy does he have a really nice house.
Is that it?
MAYA
Pretty much.
STEVE
Okay, let's go talk to the boss.
CUT TO:
Maya and Steve are the first to arrive in the wood panelled
conference room.
A detailed TABLE TOP MODEL of the compound sits in the center
of the conference table, right next to a poster-sized
satellite image of the compound.
She starts to sit in one of the chairs.
STEVE
(GENTLE)
You should sit back there...sorry.
Steve points her to the back of the room.
STEVE (CONT'D)
They're gonna ask: if bin Laden is
at the end of this rainbow - is the
Pak military with him?
MAYA
The question isn't are the Paks
protecting bin Laden?'
(MORE)
75.
MAYA (CONT'D)
The question is, 'would he allow
himself to be protected by the Paks?'
I mean, why would he trust them? He
tried to kill Musharaf.
Steve considers a reply, but the meeting principals are filing
in, including Daniel, and when Steve sees the CIA DIRECTOR
enter the room, he clears the head of the table.
CIA DIRECTOR
Go ahead.
STEVE
If you take a right out of Islamabad
and drive about forty-five minutes
North, you'll find yourself here in
Abbottabad. A middle class community -
some ex-military - not particularly
interesting to us. Except we did
find this compound, which is unique.
We got a sixteen foot wall around
the entire perimeter, the windows
are blacked out. It's a fortress.
CIA DIRECTOR
Can't you put a camera somewhere -
in the trees - to get a look into
the main house?
GEORGE
It will probably be discovered.
CIA DIRECTOR
We have to get a look into the house.
The Director moves to the satellite image.
CIA DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
Alright, what's this? This cluster
of buildings down here.
GEORGE
The PMA - The Pakistan Military
Academy. It's their West Point.
CIA DIRECTOR
And how close is that to the house?
GEORGE
About a mile.
A WOMAN'S voice from the back of the room.
76.
MAYA O.S.
4,221 feet. It's closer to eight-
tenths of a mile.
CIA DIRECTOR
Who are you?
MAYA
I'm the motherfucker that found this
place, Sir.
The boss studies her for a moment then turns back to the
model.
CIA DIRECTOR
I want to know more about who's inside
this house by the end of the week.
The brass files out, leaving Steve and Maya.
STEVE
"Motherfucker?" Really?
CUT TO:
Maya sits at her desk, frustrated, then walks down the aisle
of cubicles to the glass wall of George's office. She grabs
a red marker.
MAYA
(through the glass)
Morning, George.
In red magic marker, Maya writes the number 21 on the glass.
Then circles it.
George looks up.
MAYA (CONT'D)
Twenty-one days. It's been twenty-
one days since we found the house
and nothing's happened!
We see a drone-fed overhead IMAGE of the bin Laden house in
real time with a resolution of 100 feet. Maya stares at the
screen, trying to decipher the shapes moving beneath her,
thousands of miles away.
77.
The BLIPS move in increments, shadows lengthen.
CUT TO:
ECU - Maya erases the "51" on George's wall and replaces it
with "52."
George looks away.
Maya sits at her desk. Her phone rings.
MAYA
(INTO PHONE)
Yeah?
STEVE stares at drone image of the COMPOUND, which is under
the joystick control of an IMAGERY TECHNICIAN.
STEVE
Swing by, I want to show you
something.
Maya jumps up from her desk.
Maya walks in. Steve shows her images on the large monitor.
STEVE
This is from a few minutes ago.
We've got two males, two females,
and seven kids.
Maya points to one of the shapes in the courtyard.
MAYA
Who's that?
STEVE
I'm saying that's Bushra. The
brother's wife.
MAYA
How do you know the gender?
78.
STEVE
(points on screen, to
a thin line)
This is a clothes-line here, for
laundry. Men don't mess with the
wash.
We watch that shape move away from the clothes-line and back
to the house.
STEVE (CONT'D)
It takes her about four seconds to
move from there to the front door.
So she's on the older side.
MAYA
What's that up there?
(pointing to the other
SHAPES)
STEVE
Those are kids. They're shuffling
around, sword-fighting or something
with sticks.
(POINTING AGAIN)
You can see their height relative to
this - these are cows - so they're
probably between seven and nine.
Boys.
Another FIGURE comes out of the house and moves to the clothes-
line and grabs some laundry.
MAYA
Your female is moving fast.
STEVE
That's what I wanted to show you.
(to the Imagery
TECHNICIAN)
Can we pause this please?
(TO MAYA)
That's not the same lady. That's
female #3.
MAYA
So you found two males, three females?
STEVE
That's correct.
Maya suddenly gets it.
79.
MAYA
You're missing a male.
STEVE
Yes we are.
MAYA
Wow.
CONTINUOUS
George is on one side of a conference table, on the other
side is the DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, THE SPECIAL
ASSISTANT TO THE DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, and the
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR.
GEORGE
If there are three females, there
ought to be three males. Observant
Muslim women either live with parents
or with their husbands. We think
there's a third family living in the
house.
SUPERIMPOSE: SITUATION ROOM - THE WHITE HOUSE
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
So this third male that you've
identified as possibly being bin
Laden, do I just give up all hope of
ever seeing a photograph of him?
GEORGE
Hope? Hope is not a targeting layer.
You give up your hope right now. We
scanned for heat signatures, but we
can't validate if it's a man or a
woman up there. We found a safe
house, but we can't get a vantage
point to fire a telescope over the
balcony wall.
Maya is back at George's office, keeping track of time for
us by writing each passing day on the window of George's
office.
We watch as she erases the numbers in red and writes new
ones. 78.
Time passes.
98. 99. 100.
100 days. She underscores the numerals in thick magic marker.
CUT TO:
The same group around the same conference table.
GEORGE
He'd be the first successful drug
dealer never to have dealt drugs.
He has no internet access to the
house. He makes no phone calls either
in or out. Who's he selling to,
who's he buying from, how's he making
his money? And if you're going to
say he's retired, I'd say where's
his swimming pool, where's the gold
cage with the falcons? And why does
he send his courier to the two cities
in Pakistan we most associate with
Al Qaeda, that have nothing
particularly to do with heroin
production?
The National Security Advisor taps his pencil impatiently.
83.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
The President is a thoughtful,
analytical guy. He needs proof.
CUT TO:
The National Security Advisor and his team file out. George
approaches.
GEORGE
I have to admit, I just don't get
the rhythms of politics.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
You think this is political? If
this was political we'd be having
this conversation in October when
there's an election bump. This is
pure risk. Based on deductive
reasoning, inference, supposition
and the only human reporting you
have is six years old, from detainees
who are questioned under duress.
The political move here is to tell
you to go fuck yourself, and remind
you that I was in the room when your
old boss pitched WMD Iraq...at least
there you guys brought photographs.
GEORGE
You know, you're right, I agree with
everything you just said. What I
meant was, a man in your position,
how do you evaluate the risk of not
doing something, the risk of
potentially letting bin Laden slip
through your fingers?
George shakes his head with an "aww shucks" kind of shake.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
That is a fascinating question.
George walks away. After a beat, the National Security
advisor calls after him.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
Hey.
George turns around. The National Security Advisor approaches
him.
84.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR (CONT'D)
(lowering his voice)
I'm not saying we're gonna do it.
But the President wants to know: if
we were going to act, how would we
do it? Give us options.
CUT TO:
George is shaking his head as he talks to Wolf.
GEORGE
They are nervous downtown. I don't
think we'll get approval this decision
cycle.
They look up and notice that Maya is standing outside George's
office staring at them through the glass.
She angrily wipes the number 128 off the window and changes
it to 129.
Wolf nods.
WOLF
It's her against the world.
87.
GEORGE
Oh yeah.
CUT TO:
George is pulling his tray away from the food service court
when Maya ambushes him.
MAYA
We've spun up the SEALs - we've done
everything humanly possible to collect
on the compound, and the collection
is not going to get any better.
GEORGE
We have to keep working it.
MAYA
You're going to come into work one
day, and there's going to be a black
moving van and a 'for sale' sign in
front of that compound.
George drops his tray down.
GEORGE
Maya, you didn't prove it.
Sitting around the table are the CIA Director, JEREMY, Wolf,
the DEPUTY DIRECTOR, George, Daniel, Steve and a few other
people we don't know. At the far end of the table are back
benchers, including Maya.
CIA DIRECTOR
I'm about to go look the President
in the eye and what I'd like to know,
no fucking bullshit, is where everyone
stands on this thing. Now, very
simply. Is he there or is he not
fucking there?
He looks to the Deputy Director.
DEPUTY DIRECTOR
We all come at this through the filter
of our own past experiences. I
remember Iraq WMD very clearly, I
fronted that and I can tell you the
case for that was much stronger than
this case.
88.
CIA DIRECTOR
Yes or no.
DEPUTY DIRECTOR
We don't deal in certainty, we deal
in probability. I'd say there's a
sixty percent probability he's there.
The CIA Director points to Wolf.
WOLF
I concur. Sixty percent.
GEORGE
I'm at eighty percent. Their OPSEC
is what convinces me.
CIA DIRECTOR
You guys ever agree on anything?
DANIEL
Well, I agree with sixty, we're basing
this mostly on detainee reporting
and I spent a bunch of time in those
rooms - who knows?
Maya shoots Daniel a look. What a traitor.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
I'd say it's a soft sixty, sir. I'm
virtually certain there's some high
value target there, I'm just not
sure it's bin Laden.
The CIA Director leans back in his chair.
CIA DIRECTOR
This is a cluster-fuck, isn't it?
JEREMY
I'd like to know what Maya thinks.
DEPUTY DIRECTOR
We're all incorporating her assessment
into ours.
Maya can't take it anymore:
MAYA
One hundred percent, he's there -
okay, fine, ninety-five percent
because I know certainty freaks you
guys out - but it's a hundred!
89.
The CIA Director walks with Jeremy towards the elevator.
CIA DIRECTOR
They're all cowed. What do you think
of the girl?
JEREMY
I think she's fucking smart.
As the door closes.
CIA DIRECTOR
We're all smart, Jeremy.
Maya is eating lunch by herself when she's startled to see
the CIA Director standing by her table.
CIA DIRECTOR
May I join you?
She nods, gulps.
CIA DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
(SITTING)
How long have you worked for the
CIA?
MAYA
Twelve years. I was recruited out
of high school.
CIA DIRECTOR
Do you know why we did that?
MAYA
I don't think I can answer that
question, sir. I don't think I'm
allowed to answer.
CIA DIRECTOR
What else have you done for us besides
bin Laden?
MAYA
Nothing. I've done nothing else.
He evaluates her... weighing her certainty against his decades
of Washington experience.
90.
CIA DIRECTOR
Well, you certainly have a flare for
it.
FADE TO BLACK:
SUPERIMPOSE: THE CANARIES
BASE - DAY
The small space is filled with personnel and
telecommunications gear. At the back of the room Maya sits
quietly, adjusting a headset and speaking calmly into a secure
line. From the corner Hakim watches her.
MAYA
Testing - testing 1 - 2 - 3 -
A SEAL with his com set on gives her the thumbs up. She
looks around at all the impressive technology in the makeshift
Command Center. She walks over to Hakim and they leave
together.
Hands feather the controls as the pilot -- one the famed
Nightstalker's from the Special Operations Aviation Regiment
(SOAR) 160th -- flies without lights, using only his NODs
for night vision.

Three mikes to target. Standby for
doors open.
Inside the dim interior, illuminated by only blinking
instrumentation, the men are tense, quiet.
We pass slowly from face to face, noting each SEAL's
contemplation of the mission that lies ahead.
Some of them are anonymous soldiers. Many we've come to
know: Justin, joyfully bobbing his head, grooving to his
iPod... Saber's eyes fixed on a thousand-yard stare... Hakim
struggles to get comfortable and control his anxiety, wipes
away sweat... Patrick checks his gear for the hundredth time.

Thirty seconds.
Patrick leans out for a visual as the wind rips his face -
Cross cutting all that follows:
- At thirty feet above the ground the helicopter begins to
shudder and lose stability. Instead of descending in a
straight path, the bird drifts sideways
PATRICK
(shouting to pilot)
Hey! Slide right.
- Then lurches down, falling to within 15 feet of the swirling
ground, rotors churning the dust, creating near BROWNOUT

Although he's wearing a heavy pack and carrying gear, Patrick
jumps down, landing with a knee-shattering combat roll.
Several SEALs follow him.
BASE - EVENING
PRINCE 52 PILOT

This mission is still a go.
Off Maya's relief -
The second helo passes over but a storm of debris and garbage
from the rooftop creates another flight risk and the helo
banks away.
CUT TO:
98.
The SEALs peer inside and see ABU AHMED lying dead in a
pool of blood. Patrick and Jared pump safety rounds into
the body.
FOUR KIDS are cowering in the corner. Jared moves them out
of the house.
Piercing the first floor darkness with their infra red lights,
the SEALs advance slowly into the first floor hallway.
Piles of household clutter, stacked high in bizarre shapes,
greet them like the innards of a haunted house. One of the
SEAL's catches movement: A figure with an AK-47 scrambling
through clutter, then disappearing around a corner.
JUSTIN
Abrar!
The figure, Abu Ahmed's brother, ABRAR, re-appears at the
end of the hallway. He pokes his head out -
100.
- And is shot by Justin. He falls out of view, whimpering
in pain.
Justin walks quickly to Abrar.
ABRAR is down, bleeding.
- Justin fires another round into Abrar as ABRAR'S WIFE comes
flying in from the sleeping quarters and shields him with
her body.
- Justin shoots her. She falls...Abrar is underneath her -
he is still breathing, gasping and
- Justin shoots him again, silencing him
- Then looks to his wife and assesses her condition
- Badly wounded, faint breathing, life fading from her eyes...
- Justin turns away
Justin and a BREACHER proceed down the hall to the heavy
gate that blocks access to the stairway while another SEAL
stays behind. Somewhere, children are screaming.
JUSTIN
Shut those fucking kids up.
O.S. the kids quiet down.
JUSTIN (CONT'D)
Talk to me.
BREACHER
There's no fucking way we want to
blow this thing. The gate is solid.
MIKE (O.S.)

CUT TO:
The SEALs reach the staircase, which is sealed off by a
separate metal gate than the one inside the hallway.
SEAL
Breacher up.
A charge is prepared. Justin, who is now inside one of the
side rooms, sees Jared standing close to the door.
JUSTIN
Hey man, move!
Jared moves just as -
Saber goes up the staircase, Patrick following closely behind
him, climbing up to see -
A man ducks out of sight. Saber calls to him.
SABER
Khaled!
Saber waits with his carbine raised. Anxiety crosses his
face. He's vulnerable here, an easy target if Khaled were
to come out blasting.
SABER (CONT'D)
KHALED!
CUT TO:
103.
Khaled hears his name being called from below. A few feet
away from him in the dimly lit hall is a loaded AK-47. He
goes to the gun and picks it up.
He hears his name again, "Khaled!" And the voice sounds
friendly, urgent.
Perhaps thinking that he can surrender peacefully, Khaled
puts the gun down, resting it against a wall, and turns and
heads back to the sound of his name.
Saber sees Khaled poke his head around the corner of the
stairway and fires - killing him instantly.
Saber pushes past the body, Patrick following, and they climb
the staircase leading to the third floor.
CUT TO:
- SEALs clear the SECOND floor as women and children flow
into the hallway... A SEAL grabs one of the wives and pulls
her out into the hallway, while another female disappears
behind a large REFRIGERATOR, and he grabs her too.
Justin opens a file cabinet, stuffed with documents.
Saber is climbing the stairs, gun up, towards the third floor,
when he sees a flash of movement across the landing above
him. He stops climbing and -
SABER
(CALLING OUT)
Osama! Osama!?
Beat.
Beat.
Sweat on Saber's face
SABER (CONT'D)
Osama!?
A man appears at the end of the third floor hallway.
-- Ssssht ! a bullet strikes him in the head - knocking him
back into a bedroom
- Saber fires again, missing
- And proceeds down the hallway, going full speed now,
Patrick right behind him, sprinting into the bedroom
Two women stand at the entrance of the room. Saber rushes
them and with a football tackle, slams them into the wall.
Patrick enters the room and fires several rounds into the
man on the floor.
PATRICK
(INTO RADIO)
Possible jackpot.
The women Saber is restraining are wailing, struggling to
get to their husband, as a ten year-old boy rushes up to the
body.
105.
Patrick pushes him away and kneels down to get a better look
at the body.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
(TO SABER)
Dude, do you realize what you just
did?
CUT TO:
JARED questions the wives.
JARED
(IN ARABIC)
Who is he?
WOMAN
He is al Noori Hasan.
JARED
(shouting back to
PATRICK)
She says it's not him.
PATRICK
Talk to a kid.
Jared kneels down next to a nine year-old girl huddled in
the corner and snaps open a chem light. He gives her the
glowing green wand.
JARED
(IN ARABIC)
Daughter, what is his name?
The girl makes no reply.
CUT TO:
BASE - EVENING
COMMANDING OFFICER (O.S.)
(through the radio)
For God and Country, Geronimo.
Maya gasps.
PATRICK
(INTO RADIO)
Roger. Copy. Target Secure.
COMMANDING OFFICER (O.S.)
Target Secure - commence SSE.
Justin flicks on the lights. Moving fast he picks up a
COMPUTER tower and throws it to the floor, cracking it open,
rips out the HARD DRIVE and tosses that into the bag.
As we pull back and realize the enormity of the task in front
of him -
The lights show an organized office, crammed with information,
stacks of files, disks, video equipment.
Twenty years of jihad.
JUSTIN
(to his team)
Do not leave a hard drive.
The SEALs gather everything they can.
Saber walks down the staircase in a daze. We stay with him
as he descends, noting the faraway look in his eyes -
Saber walks into the office where the SSE (Sensitive Sight
Exploitation) is underway.
JUSTIN
(TO SABER)
What's up?
SABER
I shot the third floor guy.
JUSTIN
Good for you. You want to help?
107.
Justin tosses him an SSE bag.
CUT TO:
BASE - EVENING
The command team studies their monitors.
PRINCE 52 PILOT O.S.
(OVER RADIO)
QRF inbound.
CUT TO:
JUSTIN
(INTO RADIO)
At least ten minutes.
JUSTIN
(INTO RADIO)
This is a gold mine, I need more
time than that.
Justin yells to his team.
108.
JUSTIN
Four minutes!
CUT TO:
Hakim jogs into the main house with the BODY BAG, and through
his POV, we see slow down for the first time since the raid
began, noting the destruction:
- blood stains on the walls,
- Bodies pierced with bullets,
- Wailing children.
HAKIM
(INTO COMS)
Where do you need the bag?
SEAL (O.S.)
Third floor.
CUT TO:
SEALs roll the body into the BAG as Patrick and another SEAL
collect articles of interest. Two SEALs zip up the bag and
carry it out. Just as...
Justin's team leaves the office.
The SEALs watch the flames as the compound shrinks beneath
THEM
The SEALs sit silent in the cabin, body bag at their feet.
CUT TO:
The place is swarming with SOLDIERS, SEALs, and FBI agents
with large bio-metric scanners - loud shouting everywhere:
"mark media, first floor, who has a pen, etc."
She pushes through the busy SEALs.
Maya sees it now - way in the corner of the hangar.
110.
She walks and walks towards the bag.
She is alone with it now.
She unzips the BAG
CU: Maya.
Seven years telescoping to this moment. The end of a journey.
She stares at the body for a moment then turns to look across
the room where ADMIRAL MCRAVEN meets her eye.
She nods.
ADMIRAL MCRAVEN
(INTO PHONE)
Sir, the agency expert gave a visual
confirmation. Yes, Sir, the girl.
Hundred percent.
Maya gazes at the bloodied face, then turns away and zips
the bag...and leaves the tent.
Her eyes afire.
CUT TO:
The cavernous cargo plane is empty of passengers. The pilot
motions to the seats.
PILOT
Are you Maya?
MAYA
Yeah.
PILOT
That's the only name they gave me.
(ODD)
You can sit wherever you want, you're
the only one on the manifest.
111.
Maya sits down, buckles in. The PILOT heads back to the
CABIN
PILOT (CONT'D)
You must be pretty important, you
got the whole plane to yourself!
Beat.
PILOT (CONT'D)
Where do you want to go?
She's speechless.
Overwhelmed.
Finally, she lets go.
Those luminous eyes become pools of relief and pain.
