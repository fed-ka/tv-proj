Whispering gunfire from a television set veiled by

BUMPY O/S
This is the problem. This is what's
wrong with America.
The war footage multiplies by twenty: a stack of TVs with
price tags dangling from the knobs behind a display window.
BUMPY O/S
It's gotten so big you can't find your
way.
People on the sidewalk, out of respect or fear, part to let
Frank and Bumpy and Bumpy's German shepherd pass.
BUMPY
The corner grocery's a supermarket.
Candy store's a MacDonald's. And this

Where's the pride of ownership here?
Where's the personal service? Does
anybody work here?
Inside, the emporium is vast, with aisles that seem to
stretch off into infinity. The TVs give way to a display
window full of Japanese stereo componentry.
BUMPY
What right do they have cutting out the
suppliers, pushing all the middlemen out,
buying direct from the manufacturer -
Sony this, Toshiba that, all them Chinks -
putting Americans out of work?
He's not really asking Frank, so Frank doesn't answer.
BUMPY
What am I supposed to do with a place
like this, Frank? Who am I supposed to
ask for, the assistant manager?
(pause)
This is the problem. This is the way it
is now: You can't find the heart of
anything to stick the knife.
Bumpy stops before a display of cameras and stares in.
They're all pointed at him as a pain grips his chest and he
sinks to his knees. Frank kneels down.
FRANK
What is it?
Bumpy seems unable to speak, looks to Frank confused.
FRANK
Somebody call an ambulance!
But the store suddenly seems empty. Frank yells into the
emporium but can't be heard above the Muzak and the cash
registers ringing up sales Bumpy will never see a piece of.
Looking up at Frank, Bumpy manages weakly -
BUMPY
Forget it, Frank. No one's in charge.

Harlem's jagged teeth skyline juts across the river at the

sledgehammer gripped in Richie's fist, on the move, suddenly
fills the frame.
RICHIE
You know the Number 1 fear of most
people isn't dying; it's public speaking.
They get physically ill. They throw up.
RIVERA
And that's what you want to do for a

RICHIE
I don't like being like that.
I want to

Armed with the sledgehammer, Richie and his partner - Javy
Rivera - come past a seedy motel office where a TV shows

Hey -
Rivera flashes a New Jersey detective's shield without
breaking stride. Takes a subpoena out of another pocket.
RIVERA
Who's going to do this?
RICHIE
He knows me, he'll take it from me.
I've known him since high school.
RIVERA
Just throw it in, he doesn't take it.
That's good service.
They reach a particular motel room door. Rivera knocks.
The door opens the length of a chain, revealing a wise guy
in an undershirt, who, when he sees the subpoena, start to
close the door -
RIVERA
Throw it -
As Richie flings the subpoena in, the door slams on his
hand. He wails in agony, tries to shoulder it open, hears
the dead bolt lock on the other side, feels Campizi's teeth
bite into his fingers, watches his blood run down the frame.
RIVERA
Down -
Richie hangs down from his hand as the sledgehammer swings
past his head shattering the door -

The door rips from its hinges and the detectives crash in.
The wise guy - Campizi - hurries for the bathroom, slams the
door. This one's hollow and the detectives more easily
break through it -
Campizi tries to climb out the bathroom window. Richie
grabs him, throws him into the shower stall, taking the
plastic curtain down with them, smearing it with blood as
Richie beats at him before Rivera can pull him off.

Across the river, Richie, Rivera and Campizi sit in the car

CAMPIZI

Newsboy Moriarty's mob accountant puts the grocery bag in
the trunk of a car, climbs in behind the wheel.

From the parked car they observe the accountant putting

He comes out of another place with another bag.

Campizi slinks out of the car. Richie and Rivera follow

They tail the car into a lot, park and watch the accountant
leave his car and get into another car that's parked there.
RIVERA
We gonna stay with him or the car?
Whatever they do, they'll have to decide quick.
RICHIE
Let's see who comes for the car.

All the other cars are gone. Rivera climbs into Richie's
with coffee and a Coke in a bag, hands him the can.
RIVERA
Think he made us?
Richie doesn't know. Glances at his watch.
Cranes in his
seat to look behind them.
RICHIE
You called for the warrant?
Where are
they?
RIVERA
I just called. I called and walked back
here and ten seconds has gone by.
Richie watches an attendant lock up, listens to the street
lamps buzz, grows impatient. Indicating the other car:

bags. You don't know what's in them.

You know, what you were saying before
- about throwing up in front of people -
money will take that feeling away.
RICHIE
Not when it's less.
RIVERA
Less than what.
RICHIE

RIVERA
No lawyer on earth makes less than a cop.
RICHIE
They do in the Prosecutor's Office.
Three thousand less.
RIVERA
You're fuckin kidding me.
Richie isn't kidding. Rivera stares at him like he's crazy.
Richie checks his watch. He's waited long enough.
RICHIE
Fuck this -
RIVERA
Richie -
Richie gets out, opens the trunk, grabs a Slimjim and
bolt cutters, cuts through a gate chain and strides to the
accountant's car, Rivera following. Richie trips the
passenger door lock and pulls at the trunk release, and, as
he comes around back to search it -

Rivera may as well; the damage to the case, if there is one
anymore, is done. He crawls inside the car to look under
the seats and in the glove compartment. Gravely -
RICHIE
Javy ...
Richie's staring into the trunk like there's a body inside.
Rivera comes over, takes a look, sees it's money: stacks of
it rubber-banded together, spilling from grocery bags - more
than either of them has ever seen. As the trunk closes -

Richie and Rivera sit in their car in silence, staring out
at the car with the money in it. Eventually -
RICHIE
This isn't a couple of bucks.
RIVERA
It's the same thing.
In principle.
RICHIE
We're talking about principle?
RIVERA
Richie, a cop who turns in this kind of
money says one thing: He'll turn in cops
who take money. We'll be pariahs.
RICHIE
We're fucked either way.
RIVERA
Not if we keep it. Only if we don't.
Then we're fucked, you're right. But not
if we keep it.
RICHIE
(more to himself)
Yes, we are.
RIVERA
Goddamn it, did we ask for this? Did we
put a gun to someone's head and say, Give
us your money? Cops kill cops they can't
trust. We can't turn it in.
They regard each other again in silence ...

As Richie leaves alone, he's aware of all the eyes on him -
knowing the other cops' looks don't signify awe or respect,
but contempt and fear, like Rivera predicted. Neither will
ever be trusted again. He climbs into his car, drives off.

people on the roller coaster squeal as Frank comes out of
his meditative trance with an idea.

She regards him with a weary look, but he's looking over at

He looks back, not sure he heard right.

Vegas.
LAURIE
Oh, like this is a good environment.
Around your friends. There are less

The noise of the glass is driving him crazy. He strides
over to the teenagers, who look at him like, What are you
gonna do, old man, it's four against one.
RICHIE
I told you nice to shut the fuck up.

As Richie's car turns a corner, the Stephen Crane Projects -
the most foreboding place on earth - rises up: three dark
30-floor towers planted on war-torn grounds where a long-ago
torched and abandoned patrol car sits like a monument.
He parks and moves through an agitated all-black crowd, past
an ambulance outside one of the towers, through oppressive

Richie comes out ahead of the gurney, moving quickly like
it's a matter of life and death (which it is), motioning at

Step back, injured man coming out. Let
them do their job and he'll be all right.
Ma'am. Excuse me. Step back. Sir.
Please.
The people step back when they see the victim on the gurney:
tubes in his nostrils, IV in his arm, eyes open. Before they
can look any closer, he's put in the ambulance. As it pulls

a sold "For Sale" sign leans against a half-built kennel.
Out front, a caravan of cars and pickup trucks - North
Carolina plates - loaded with boxes and suitcases - has just
arrived. Exhausted from the drive but excited to be here,
the travelers climb out: Frank's five brothers, their wives
and kids, and their mother.
Teddy thinks it's the right place. The others aren't as
sure. The house is too nice. There's a new Lincoln Towncar
parked outside the garage. They'll probably be shot for

It's as if life on the street has stopped. No one moves;
everyone is looking at Frank; maybe that's what he wants.
As Tango laughs at the thought -
FRANK
Yeah, that's right.
Frank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like
someone hit with a board. Frank stands over him and empties
the gun in his chest, the shots echoing down the street.
Then it's quiet again. Everyone's still looking him, but
Frank doesn't run. Instead, he calmly reaches into Tango's
suit pocket, takes out a money clip thick with cash, drops
it in the "jar" and sets it next to the body.
FRANK
For the cops. Should be enough.
Frank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the

Abruzzo, looking like a junkie, dirty jeans, wool cap,

Air conditioner full blast. Radio announcing the time: 4

It's as if an outdoor market has just opened its stalls.
Junkies and dealers emerging from the alleys, storefronts,
tenements and side streets - from the street itself it seems
- snarling the cars and delivery trucks caught unaware.
Small blue cellophane packets - and only blue - are pulled
from pockets and change hands. In alleyways it's cooked up
and sucked into syringes, and in dank, grim, indescribably
filthy rooms, plunged into veins -

10 and 20 dollar bills changing hands - decks of cash

The seller is observed coming out of a mechanics garage.
Richie ignores him as he walks away, watching instead the

The pickup pulls to the curb outside a Pleasant Avenue
grocery store. As the guy enters the place, Spearman's car
stops long enough for Richie to climb out, and continues on.
Richie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is
talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to
go. Spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the
block. As soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the
restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at Richie who
has to double back quickly not to be seen
Richie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading
crates. Hears a horn and knows it's must be Spearman stuck
on the side street. The mechanic starts his truck.
Desperate not to lose him (and his money), Richie hurries
over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge.
RICHIE
Get out.
TAXI DRIVER
What?
RICHIE
Get the fuck out of the car!
The driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and
tries to get his window rolled up. Reaching in, Richie gets
his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags
the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in.
He swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic,
screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead
- guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his
mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding -
The truck turns up ahead, and Richie barrels through another
red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple
car-lengths ahead - in sight.

Richie curbs the cab as the guy goes into a dingy pizza

From around a corner, striding toward him, come four men

the Princes of the City. Richie detours into an alley as
they enter the restaurant.
Richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy
basement window. Watches Trupo and his SIU detectives burst
in, guns drawn. They rough everybody up, get some down on
the floor. One detective gathers the money and stuffs it in
a bag. Another gathers the dope. The mechanic tries to
protest and Trupo slaps him down with his pistol.
Richie keeps watching as the NY cops arrest no one - but
take the dope and the money (Richie's money) - and stride
out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits. As they
come past Richie -
RICHIE
That's my money.
SIU DET 1
The fuck are you. What money?
Richie shows them his Bureau of Narcotics ID.
RICHIE
The bills are sequenced and registered
with the Essex County Prosecutors Office.
All begin with CF3500. Take a look.
One of them checks some of the bills and sees he's right.
SIU DET. 2
Goddamn it, I thought we had a score.
I thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft
sitting in my driveway.
RICHIE
Honest mistake. Just give it back to me.
SIU DET. 1
This time.
Three of the four cops laugh. It's an affable gang of
thieves. The one who doesn't laugh hangs back as the others
start off. He examines Richie's New Jersey ID.

Thank you.
Tony nods, You're welcome.
Can tell there's something else
on Richie's mind.
TONY
What.

MRS. TOSCA

You want to miss the fight? Come on.

He talks to them, returns to his car, takes a valise from
the trunk. He snaps it open revealing stacks of cash, hands
it over and walks to a semi-truck, glancing once in Richie's

positions in the trees, stand ready to open fire if they
have to as Frank, Nate, the soldiers and mules pass below.

They seem to have made it, winding back down through the
jungle with the mules. Suddenly a barrage of gunfire erupts
from the trees - a couple of Nate's men are hit as the rest
dive for cover, shouting "Vietcong," and returning the fire.
Frank drops down from his mule, gets a pistol out and shoots
into the trees. Bullet-severed palm fronds rain down.
FRANK
Give them half!
Nate, pinned down by the mules, can't hear him over the
noise.
FRANK
Cut half of them loose!
The mules!
Nate cuts the mule-train tether in the middle, slaps at the
animals. As the freed mules disappear into a wall of trees
the shooting subsides, then stops altogether. Smoke from
all the gunfire rises like mist around the half dozen Thais
and Americans lying dead on the ground.

Teddy makes out with a girl in the back seat of his car.
The pay phone just outside on the corner rings, and he gets
out, steps past Jimmy, answers it -
271
272
Jimmy loiters close enough to the open pay phone, to hear
Teddy's side of the conversation.
TEDDY
Short Term Lot 3. This the Mustang were
talking about ... Camero? ... What's the
plate number?
(writes on a napkin)
Yeah, I got it ... I got it, Frank ...
(sighs; reads from the
napkin:)

The plane, with that tail number, descends through clouds.

Richie's entire staff of detectives, along with Toback, the
DA and several customs agents, stand on the tarmac, watching
the military plane taxiing toward them -

Quiet sounds of suburban domesticity - chirping birds, a
distant lawn mower -

The cabin door slides up, the passengers begin emerging:
Military officers, embassy personnel and families. Richie's
detectives and Toback watch him with concern as the official
passengers, met by a bevy of assistants, file past -

An Army captain approaches Richie's law enforcement group.

Frank's bedroom has been destroyed. Trupo, standing at a
window glances out at the sound of a barking of a dog to see
Frank's German shepherd down in its kennel.

Trupo crosses the lawn toward the kennel and barking dog -

293
Trupo regards the shepherd snarling at him from behind the
kennel fence. Comes around back. Pushes at the frame. It
moves a little, like it's levered -

Trupo comes around to the front of the kennel again with his
gun out and aims it at the dog. As he fires -

The dead dog slides against the fencing as Trupo overturns
the kennel to reveal Frank's stash of cash.

Richie and Toback walk briskly across the lobby -
TOBACK
He was out of line, Richie.
Richie isn't really listening. Strides past his detectives
on his way out of the building. To Spearman -
TOBACK
It's over.
You're shut down.
Toback watches as the detectives follow after Richie
striding toward his car.

The white caskets are taken to a loading dock, put in a
military truck. Papers are signed, copies exchanged. As
the truck drives off -

A laundry truck idles. Stevie, the Lucas nephew who could
have played for Yankees, jumps down, helps the two privates
toss several laundry bags into the back of the truck.

A minister on the steps welcomes the congregation which

The laundry truck comes past a guard gate, leaves the base,
drives past a stand of trees. As it passes, Richie, parked
by his detectives' cars, recognizes the young driver - who's
wearing the same Yankee baseball cap in his T.O. photo.
As Richie and his detectives climb into their cars, two
Lucas cars fold in behind the laundry truck. The detectives
follow at a distance -

Frank emerges from the church, kisses his mother and Ana and

alone. His mother watches, wondering perhaps if he intends
to go kill Trupo after all. As Doc's car leaves, so does
another.

From overhead, the laundry truck, the gun car and the van -

different directions -

Red Top's van makes a turn. As Abruzzo's makes the same
turn behind it, the infamous Stephen Crane Projects rise up
in his windshield.
His foot comes off the gas. As the gun car passes, he
sees Jones's car slow. Teddy's car approaches from another
direction into the Projects, and Abruzzo sees Spearman pull
over. Then the laundry truck turns in, and Richie's slows
to a stop, like Abruzzo's, outside the grounds of the
foreboding towers. The gospel music ends.

Doc waits in the car while Frank buys some flowers at a
cemetery flower stand. The surveillance car cruises past.

Richie, on a pay phone across down the street from the
Projects, looks up at the dark South tower.
RICHIE
Lou. We're ready to go in there
knowing there's a good chance we won't
all come out. That's what we're willing
to do. All I'm asking you to do get me a
warrant.
Silence on the other end of the line ...
RICHIE
We don't have a lot of time to fuck
around -

I'll call in the warrant. And some

This call disconnects.

Richie and his guys wait for the warrant by their cars.
JONES
How long we gonna wait for it?

Richie stares down the street, waiting for whatever it is
they're waiting for. Spearman looks at his watch.
RICHIE
It'll be here.

Frank's car winds up the road of the cemetery. The
surveillance car comes through the main gate and parks.

Several black and white and undercover cars approach,
sirens off. Toback himself climbs out of one of the cars
and hands Richie the search warrant.

The tall buildings cast long shadows of dread on every
activity below, no matter how routine: A woman pushing a
stroller, guys shooting hoops, a couple arguing, kids on
bikes, old men resting on a graffiti-covered bench.
The unmarked cars drive slowly through it all. The place
teeters on the brink of violence you can feel as gangs move
under the shadow of the towers.

Frank walks past graves to Bumpy's. Replaces some dried
flowers with fresh ones. Looks around for something to sit
on. Sees some wooden folding chairs around a fresher grave
nearby. Doc waits by the car in the distance.

Police cars outside.
Eugene Lucas is cuffed and led away.

Frank, on a wooden folding chair at Bumpy's grave, hears
the gunning of engines and barking of cops. He turns to see
Doc being handcuffed on the ground by the Towncar. Glances
to a lone figure walking toward him over a rise. Richie.
Richie arrives at the grave. Regards the monument to
Ellsworth Johnson, and Frank sitting calmly regarding him.
Richie glances around the peaceful surroundings ...
RICHIE
What kind of trees are these?
Frank looks at the trees, then at Richie, with equal
serenity.
FRANK
You think you got Frank Lucas.
You
got nothing.

Trupo, coffee in hand, comes into his garage from his
kitchen. Opens the garage door and sees two squad cars
parked outside ...

A TV: A report on the indictments handed down by the
351
Manhattan DA's office against 53 NYPD and SIU detectives -

354
Frank steps out into sunlight, free but owning nothing but
the cardboard box in his arms. Looks out across the parking
lot to see if anyone has come to pick him up. Sees Richie
by his car, hand raised above his head like a flag.
355
355
The two of them stand outside Richie's car on the same
corner Frank shot Tango. Frank looks up at the street signs
that used to say 116th Street and 8th Avenue. Now they say
116th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.
FRANK
Frederick Douglass Boulevard? What was
wrong with just plain 8th Avenue?
He considers the street itself. It too has changed. The
corner groceries, as Bumpy prophesied, really are gone now.

FRANK
I used to sit here with Ana in my old
car. She hated it. Now I don't even
have a car. Or her.
Frank glances to where his favorite diner used to be, and
across the street to where he shot Tango. It isn't a fruit
stand any more.
FRANK
Just do what?
RICHIE
What?
FRANK
The fuck is that? Just do what?
It's a Nike store with huge paintings of Michael Jordan and
the admonition "Just Do It."
RICHIE
Sneakers.
Expensive ones.
FRANK
Who the fuck would buy those?
A car equipped with sub-woofer bass comes booming past.
Frank stares at it with the same pained look Bumpy had at
the discount emporium.
RICHIE
Your brothers know you're out?
FRANK
I haven't talked to them in years. It's
better that way. For them. I don't know
where they are. Went back to Greensboro
when they got out, I guess.
Richie nods.
Frank looks back at the new storefronts.
FRANK
What am I going to do now, be a janitor?
What do I know how to do? How am I going
to live?
RICHIE
I told you I wouldn't let you starve.
FRANK
You told me but you can barely take care
of yourself.

FRANK (CONT'D)
(glances to a pay phone on
the corner)
You know, one phone call, Richie, I could
be back in business.
The look Richie gives him calmly assures Frank if he did
that it'd be the last phone he made outside prison - ever.
FRANK
I won't.
I'm just saying I could.
He buttons the cuffs of the fake Members Only windbreaker
Richie bought him off the street.
FRANK
Thanks for the clothes.
RICHIE
You're welcome.
Frank glances away to three young hoods coming toward them
like they own the sidewalk and everything around it - baggy
pants, bandanas tied around their heads.
FRANK
Uh-oh. Look out. Here come the
gangsters.
Frank's right in their path but doesn't move, forcing one
of them to squeeze between him and a parking meter. The
gangsta looks back, is about to say something, or do
something, but, examining the expression of quiet menace on
Frank's face, thinks better of it. The others stop.
GANGSTA 2
What.
The first one is still staring at Frank, but finally has the
good sense to let it go.
GANGSTA 1
Nothing.
They move on.
Frank glances to Richie.
FRANK
Every idiot gets to be young once.
Frank zips up his Members Only jacket, props up the collar
and points himself in the other direction.
FRANK
Let's get out of here.
