                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY11

      Fingers wrap through and around the worn threads in the net 
      of a LACROSSE STICK. Backpack at his feet, an unusually 
      pensive Stiles absentmindedly tightens the knots on the head 
      of the stick.

                                  STILES
                    You know, when you re drowning, you 
                    don t actually inhale until right 
                    before you re about to black out. 
                    It s called voluntary apnea.

      EXT. WOODS/CREEK - NIGHT - FLASHBACK22

      Gloved hands taking hold of Matt, Gerard shoves his head into 
      the creek water.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY33

      Stiles pulls a knot on the lacrosse stick tighter and 
      tighter.

                                  STILES
                    It s like no matter how much you re 
                    freaking out, the instinct to not 
                    let water in is so strong, you 
                    won t open your mouth until you 
                    feel like your head s exploding.

      EXT. WOODS/CREEK - DAY44

      Deputies string POLICE TAPE around the site of Matt s 
      drowning while Stilinski watches a CORONER zip up a BODY BAG.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    But when you finally do let it in, 
                    that s when it stops hurting. It s 
                    not scary anymore. It s actually 
                    kind of peaceful.

                                    MORRELL (V.O.)*
                    Are you saying you hope Matt felt 
                    some peace in his last moments?                TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/122.


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY55

      Stiles glances up to Ms. Morrell.

                                  STILES
                    I don t feel sorry for him.

                                    MORRELL
                    Can you feel sorry for the nine 
                    year-old Matt who drowned?

                                  STILES
                    Just because a bunch of dumbasses 
                    dragged him into a pool when he 
                    couldn t swim doesn t mean he s 
                    allowed to kill them off one-by-
                    one. And, by the way, my dad said 
                    they found pictures of Allison on 
                    his computer. Not just her. Matt 
                      Photoshopped himself into them. 
                    Stuff like them holding hands and 
                    kissing. Like he d built this whole 
                    fake relationship. So drowning 
                    might have sent him off the rails, 
                    but the dude was definitely riding 
                    the crazy train.

      EXT. WOODS/CREEK - DAY66

      As the body bag is lifted up to be taken away, Stilinski 
      kneels to look out over the water.

                                    MORRELL (V.O.)
                    One positive thing came out of it, 
                    though. Right?

      The REFLECTION of something metallic and shiny glints off the 
      water. Stilinski turns to find a hand holding out his 
      SHERIFF S BADGE. With a soft smile of pride, he takes it.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY77

      Stiles s eyes focus on the threads of the lacrosse stick.

                                  STILES
                    Yeah, but it still feels like 
                    there s something wrong between us. 
                    Like there s this tension whenever 
                    we talk. Same thing with Scott.

                                    MORRELL
                    Have you talked to him since that 
                    night?                TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/123.

        CONTINUED:77

                                  STILES
                    Not really. He s got his own 
                    problems to deal with...

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY88

      Pulling a new hoodie out of a Macy s shopping bag, Scott 
      slips it on and then grabs his backpack. When he steps into 
      the hallway, he hears a door CLICK closed.

                                  SCOTT
                    Mom?

      Approaching her door, he leans in to listen. Unable to see 
      her standing on the other side, he can still hear the BEATING 
      of her heart.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Mom? We re going to have to talk 
                    about this eventually.

      Melissa puts her hand on the knob. But can t seem to turn it.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Okay. I m going. Love you.

      He holds still, hand at the door, fingers lightly touching it 
      as if trying to make some kind of contact with his mother. 

      Finally, he turns to leave while Melissa gently rests her 
      cheek against the door, listening to his receding FOOTSTEPS.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY99

      Morrell cocks her head, trying to gauge Stiles s reactions 
      through the netting of the lacrosse stick. 

                                  STILES
                    No, I m pretty sure he hasn t 
                    talked to Allison either. But 
                    that s more her choice, I think.

      INT. ALLISON S CAR - NIGHT1010

      Allison shuts off the ignition. Then pauses before getting 
      out. Hesitantly, she breathes on the window, steaming it up 
      to reveal a message from Scott: 12pm. 

      Beneath it he s written one word in caps: PLEASE. 

      Gathering her sleeve into her fist, Allison reluctantly wipes 
      away the message. From the look on her face, it s clear she 
      has no plan to meet him.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/124.

      CONTINUED:1010

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    Her mom dying hit her really hard. 
                    But I guess it kind of brought her 
                    and her dad closer.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/BASEMENT - DAY1111

      Surrounded by weapons in the basement, Allison watches Argent 
      use a RED MARKER to cross off a section on a MAP OF BEACON 
      HILLS. Several other areas are already crossed out. 

      Underneath the red slashes lies one location yet to be 
      eliminated: BEACON HILLS RAIL DEPOT.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    Jackson?

      INT. WHITTEMORE HOME/JACKSON S ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK1212

      In the darkness, Jackson sits on the edge of his bed.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    He hasn t really been himself 
                    lately.

      Hands red, BLOOD drips from his claws.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    Thing is, right now, Lydia s the 
                    one who seems the most normal.

      INT. MARTIN HOME - NIGHT - FLASHBACK1313

      At her birthday party, Lydia is all smiles while handing out 
      drinks.

                                    MORRELL (V.O.)
                    And what about you, Stiles?

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY1414

      Morrell watches Stiles closely from behind her desk.

                                    MORRELL
                    Feeling any anxiety about the 
                      championship game tomorrow night?

      Stiles looks up. He has one of the threads on the lacrosse 
      stick clenched between his teeth.

                                  STILES
                          (through his teeth)
                    Why would you ask that?                TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/125.

      CONTINUED:1414

      Realizing what he s doing, he sets the lacrosse stick down.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    I never actually play. But hey, 
                    since one teammate is dead and the 
                    other missing, who knows?

                                    MORRELL
                    You mean, Isaac? One of the three 
                    runaways. You haven t heard from 
                    any of them, have you?

      Stiles ignores the question, focusing on Morrell s desk.

                                  STILES
                    How come you re not taking notes?

                                    MORRELL
                    I do my notes after the session.

                                  STILES
                    Your memory s that good?

                                    MORRELL
                    How about we get back to you?

      Stiles hesitates, eyeing her with suspicion.

                                    MORRELL (CONT D)
                    Stiles?

                                  STILES
                    I m fine. Except for the not 
                    sleeping. The jumpiness. And this 
                    constant, overwhelming, crushing 
                    fear that something incredibly 
                    terrible is going to happen.

                                    MORRELL
                    It s called hyper-vigilance. The 
                      persistent feeling of being under 
                    threat.

                                  STILES
                    It s not just a feeling. It s like 
                    I m about to have a panic attack. 
                    Like I can t even breathe.

                                    MORRELL
                    Like you re drowning?

      Stiles slowly nods.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/126.

      CONTINUED:1414

                                    MORRELL (CONT D)
                    So if you re drowning and you re 
                    keeping your mouth closed up until 
                    that last moment, what if you 
                    choose to not open your mouth? To 
                    not let the water in?

                                  STILES
                    You do anyway. It s a reflex.

                                  MORRELL*
                    But if you can hold off until the 
                    reflex kicks in, then you have more 
                    time, right?

                                  STILES
                    Not much time.

                                    MORRELL
                    But more time to fight your way to 
                    the surface?

                                  STILES
                    I guess.

                                    MORRELL
                    More time to be rescued?

                                  STILES
                    More time to be in agonizing pain. 
                    Remember the part where you feel 
                    like your head s exploding?

                                    MORRELL
                    If it means survival, isn t a 
                    little agony worth it?

                                  STILES
                    What if it just gets worse? What if 
                    it s agony now and hell later on?

                                    MORRELL
                    Then think about something Winston 
                    Churchill once said: If you re 
                    going through hell... keep going.

      Meeting Morrell s resolute stare, Stiles nods in 
      understanding.

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT1515

      Steam billows out of the bathroom as Scott steps out of the 
      shower and wraps himself in a towel.                 TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/127.

      CONTINUED:1515

      He reaches up to the mirror to wipe away the steam. But then 
      pauses, turning his head to listen. All he hears, however, is 
      the TRICKLE of water.

      Scott swipes at the mirror to reveal his face. Running a hand 
      through his hair, he turns around and steps out of the 
      bathroom to find--

      A PAIR OF FEET hanging several inches off the floor.

      Melissa stares down at him in terror, fingers grasping at the 
      TAIL wrapped around her neck which holds her almost a foot 
      off the floor. 

      Perched in the corner between the ceiling and the walls 
      above, the Kanima stares defiantly at Scott.

      Only few a feet away, Gerard sits in the reclining chair, 
      seeming perfectly at home.

                                  GERARD
                    As you can see, Scott, there have 
                    been some interesting developments 
                    lately. I think we should catch up.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT1616

      Scott s fist snaps open to reveal his CLAWS unsheathed.

                                  GERARD
                    Come on, Scott, let s be realistic 
                    about who has the upper hand here.

      The Kanima s tail tightens around Melissa s neck.

                                  SCOTT
                    Let her go.

                                  GERARD
                    Can t do that. But... Let her live? 
                    That s up to you.

                                  SCOTT
                    What do you want?

                                  GERARD
                    I want to talk. You haven t been 
                    answering your phone.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/128.

                                  SCOTT
                    Let her go and we can talk about 
                    whatever you want.

      Gerard stands and walks to Melissa who continues gasping for 
      breath, hands clutching at the tail around her neck.

                                  GERARD
                    I want the same thing I ve always 
                    wanted. I want Derek and his pack.

                                  SCOTT
                    You ve got them all in hiding. How 
                    should I know where they are?

                                  GERARD
                    I think with the proper motivation 
                    you could draw them out. And if you 
                    hadn t noticed I now have a fairly 
                      impressive means by which to 
                    motivate people.

      He gives an almost prideful glance at the creature.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Why do you think I m able to 
                    control him? You know the myth, 
                    Scott. The Kanima is a weapon of 
                      vengeance.

                                  SCOTT
                          (realizing)
                    This is about Kate?

                                  GERARD
                    I didn t just come here to bury my 
                    daughter. I came to avenge her.

      The Kanima whips its tail free of Melissa s neck, letting her 
      drop to the floor. Scott rushes to her side as she coughs for 
      air. When he looks up again, he glimpses the Kanima s tail 
        disappearing out the top of the doorway, Gerard following. 

      Alone with his mother, Scott finds her still breathless, but 
      also looking back at him with frightened eyes.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you okay?

                                    MELISSA

                    even what you are, but whatever he 
                    wants, just give it to him.

                                  SCOTT

                                    MELISSA
                    Do what he wants. Just give him 
                    what he wants.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT1717

      Backpacks slung over their shoulders, Erica and Boyd hurry 
      through the woods. Boyd grabs Erica by the arm, stopping her.

                    Derek said to be back before the

                    I thought I heard something.

                    If we re doing the I thought I 
                    heard something thing we shouldn t 
                    be stopping. We should be running.

                                  BOYD
                    Listen.

      Erica holds still, watching Boyd s eyes wander over through 
      the trees. Then they both hear it. A HOWLING.

                                  ERICA
                    Was that a coyote?

      Boyd shakes his head.

                    Maybe it was--

      But she stops as the HOWLING rises again. Louder and closer. 
      Both she and Boyd slowly turn about, trying to discern its 
      position.

      Another wolf begins HOWLING. Then another joins in. And 
      another and another, until--

      An astonished Boyd and Erica find themselves listening to a 
      CHORUS of WOLVES, their plaintiff cries rising and falling, 
      soaring up and into the woods.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:

      INT. HALE HOUSE - DAY1818*

      An old and burned BOOK drops to the floor. Derek grabs *
      another from a shelf inside the Hale House, desperately *
      searching and discarding book after book. He pauses. Then *
      turns to find Erica and Boyd by the stairwell.*

                                  DEREK*
                    You decided.*

      Erica nods.*

                    When?

                    It s not like we want to.

                    What do you want?

                    Since I just turned sixteen a month 
                    ago, I wouldn t mind getting my 
                    license. I can t do that if I m 
                    dead, you know.

                                  DEREK
                    I told you there was a price.

                    You didn t tell us it was going to

                    You do it as a pack. And you re 
                    only a pack with an Alpha.

      Derek lowers a book and turns his gaze on Boyd. Despite his *
      size, Boyd can t hold Derek s stare for long. And it s the 
      turning away that makes Derek understand.

                                  DEREK
                    You re going to look for another 
                    pack.

      They confirm it with their silence.

                    How are you even going to find one?

                    We think we already did.

      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC/EXAMINING ROOM - DAY1919

      A TINY DROP OF LIQUID slips off the tip of a NEEDLE. Deaton 
      sets the automatic syringe on a tray by the examining table 
      where a sick DOG lies.

      The front door CHIMES, catching his attention.

                                  DEATON
                    Would you mind seeing who that is?

      Scott glances up from the counter where he operates a 
      MEDICATION CAPSULE FILLING MACHINE.

      Deaton notices the dog on the table WHIMPERING. In the back, 
      other DOGS can be heard BARKING louder and louder, as if 
      responding to the new presence in the clinic.

      Deaton glances to Scott who shares his uneasy look. They 
      slowly move to peer out to the waiting room where--

      Isaac gazes down on the GATE made from mountain ash, afraid 
      to approach it.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    It s all right, Isaac. We re open.

      INT. HALE HOUSE - DAY2020*

      Derek listens with skepticism to Erica s explanation.

                                  ERICA
                    And all of a sudden we hear this 
                    howling. It was unbelievable.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1213.

                    There must have been a dozen of 
                    them.

                                  ERICA
                    Maybe more.

                                  DEREK
                    Or maybe only two. You know what 
                    the Beau Geste effect is? If they 
                    modulate their howls with a rapid 
                    shift in tone, two wolves can sound 
                    like twenty.

      Erica and Boyd look to each other, both uncertain now.

                                  ERICA
                    It doesn t matter. There s another 
                    pack out there. There s got to be. 
                    We ve made up our minds.

                    We lost, Derek. It s over. We re

                    You re running. And once you start, 
                    you don t stop. You ll always be 
                    running.

      Derek returns to searching the books and doesn t bother to *
      look back as Erica takes Boyd s hand to lead him out.*

      When their footsteps have faded, Derek lets his weary eyes *
      close with a regret-filled sigh. But then--HIS EYES SNAP 
      OPEN.

      Grabbing a PIECE OF BROKEN GLASS, Derek whips around, tossing *
      the shard like a throwing knife and--*

      Peter Hale catches it just before it goes into his throat.*

                    I was hoping for a slightly warmer 
                    welcome than that. But...

      Isaac watches Scott gently hold the dog still on the 
      examining table while Deaton administers a shot from the 
      automatic syringe.

      Leaning forward, Isaac crinkles up his nose in disgust.

                                  ISAAC
                    Why does it smell like that?

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  DEATON
                    Scott said almost the exact same 
                    thing to me a few months ago. One 
                    day he could somehow tell which 
                    animals were getting better and 
                    which were not.

                                  ISAAC
                          (eyeing the dog)
                    He s not getting better, is he?

      Deaton shakes his head. The dog WHINES softly.

                    It s a very distinct scent, isn t 
                    it? Come here.

      Scott gives Isaac a nod as if to say it ll be okay.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    I think you re pretty aware of what 
                    your new abilities can do for you. 
                    But have you ever wondered what 
                    they can do for others? Give me 
                    your hand.

      Isaac cautiously holds his hand out for Deaton. The vet takes 
      it and gently places it on the dying animal.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1215.

      Hesitant, Isaac pets the dog. Almost immediately, the animal 
      stops whining. Its breathing slows, body calming as Isaac 
      strokes the back of its head.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    You know petting a dog releases 
                    serotonin in our brains? In the 
                    dog s brain the primary chemical is 
                    oxytocin. But that s when a human 
                    pets it. Someone like you or Scott 
                    can have a different effect.

      Then, with widening eyes, Isaac pauses to raise his free 
      hand. The VEINS on it have darkened considerably. Teeth 
      clenched in pain, Isaac squeezes his hand into a fist and 
      watches it return to normal.

      Astonished, he peers down at the dog which rests far more 
      easily now while affectionately nuzzling Isaac s other hand.

                                  ISAAC
                    What was that?

                    Just a little bit. But sometimes a 
                    little can make quite a difference.

      When Isaac looks up again, his eyes are glistening.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s okay. First time he showed me, 
                    I cried too.

      Then Isaac does something he rarely ever does. He laughs.

      While cleaning up the capsule filling machine, Scott listens 
      to Isaac explain his situation.

                    I m not telling you. I m asking.

                                  ISAAC

      FADE IN:

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT2525

      The field lies dark, quiet and empty. Until one-by-one the 
      STADIUM LIGHTS burst on, the GAME CLOCK resets to zero and an 
      excited crowd begins filling the bleachers.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT2626

      Amid the players hurrying to get ready for the game, Jackson 
      quietly pulls his pads on. His movements are slow and 
      strangely purposeful.

                                  DANNY
                    You okay, dude?

                                    JACKSON
                    I m perfect.

                                  DANNY
                    Well, we all knew that. But are you 
                    okay? You didn t text me back all 
                    week. I m getting kind of worried 
                    about you. Jackson.

      He blinks at the sound of his name, looking at the lacrosse 
      stick in his hands as if not quite sure how it got there. 
      Then a kind of brief understanding seems to come to him.

                                    JACKSON
                          (quietly)
                    Stay in the goal tonight, Danny. 
                    Don t come out. And if you see me 
                    coming toward you... Run the other 
                    way. As fast as you can.

      His last words echo across the room to another locker where 
      Scott uses his elevated hearing to listen in on the 
      unsettling exchange.

      While pulling his pads on, he doesn t notice his mother, 
      Melissa, peering in at the door. She glances about, trying to 
      find him among the other players. But then Coach BANGS his 
      clipboard against a locker.

                                  COACH
                    Good morning.

      The team quiets. Melissa glances up, confused since it s 
      clearly nighttime.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1220.

                    the largest aerial battle in the 
                    history of mankind. 

      Melissa blinks, now very confused.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Mankind. That word should have new 
                    meaning for all of us today. We 
                    can t be consumed by our petty 
                      differences anymore. We will be 
                    united in our common interests.

      Melissa glances around to see if anyone else is confused.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Perhaps it s fate that today is the 
                    fourth of July--

                                  COACH
                    And you will once again be fighting 
                    for our freedom. Not from tyranny, 
                      oppression, or persecution, but 
                    from annihilation.

      The team CHEERS. Melissa leans over to the nearest player, 
      Stiles, and whispers to him as Coach continues.

                                    MELISSA

                    of July will no longer be known as

                    when the world declared: We will

                    I don t think he cares.

                    to survive! Today, we celebrate our 
                      Independence Day!

      The team EXPLODES IN CHEERS. Melissa sees her chance to grab 
      Scott s attention. But just as she starts forward, Stiles 
      puts a hand on her arm, stopping her.

                                  GERARD
                    Well spoken, Coach.

      Gerard steps in, gently clapping his hands.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    I might have chosen something with 
                    a little more historical value but 
                    there s no denying your passion. 
                    And while I haven t been here long,

                    brilliant tonight, even with only 
                    one Co-Captain leading you.

      Scott blinks in surprise. He looks to Coach who noticeably 
      averts his gaze.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Now, I m your principal, but also a

      With a flurry of CHEERS, the team charges out. As he moves to 
      follow, Gerard aims a baleful smile at Scott. He turns to 
      face Coach.

      Lips bloody, Peter bravely lifts his chin for the next hit. 
      But Derek slowly lowers his fist and lets him go.

                                  DEREK
                    You can t help me.

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT2828

      Scott sits next to Stiles on the bench as the crowd fills the 
      bleachers, moments from the game beginning.

                                  SCOTT

      Stiles nods to the bleachers behind them where Sheriff

      Scott turns to him with a gentle understanding. Stiles looks *

      Stiles looks to Scott who gives his friend a nod of 
      encouragement.

      IN THE BLEACHERS - Melissa notices Stilinski slowly rising.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Why s my son running onto the

                                    MELISSA
                    Because he s on the team?

                                  STILINSKI
                    He is. He s on the team. He s on 
                    the field. My son s on the field!

      The crowd on the bleachers all look up at Stilinski. With a 
      huge smile on his face, he quietly sits back down. Even Scott 
      can t help but smile. Until a VOICE finds its way into his 
      hearing...

                                  GERARD (V.O.)
                    Scott? Can you hear me?*

      He turns, scanning the bleachers, trying to locate Gerard.*

                                  GERARD (V.O.)
                    Ah, you can. Good. Then listen 
                    closely. Because the game s about 
                    to get interesting...

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT2929

        A preternatural quiet grips the woods. Until the LIGHTS of an 
      ALL TERRAIN VEHICLE part the shadows. ENGINES ROARING, two 
      ATV s loaded with Argent s hunters burst through the trees.

      The ATV driving Allison and Argent slows to a stop, engine 
      lowering to an idle. Argent turns to his daughter.

                                  ARGENT
                    Play it again.

      Allison raises a REMOTE and clicks a button on it, Argent 
      glances to the SPEAKER attached to the front of the ATV.

      With a high-powered clarity, a HOWL soars from the speaker 
      and into the woods. The sound quickly becomes a chorus of 
      WOLVES.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1226.

      Not far from the ATV s, two utterly terrified teenagers hide 
      under a cover of trees. Erica s hand slips into Boyd s for 
      comfort as--

      The HOWLS rise, louder and louder.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT3030

      Gerard s SILVER PILL BOX reflects the stadium lights as he 
      turns it over in his hand. He stands at the edge of the field 
      surveying the two teams lining up.

                                  GERARD
                    Let s put a real clock on this 
                    game, Scott.

      Sitting on the bench just a few yards away, Scott keeps his 
      eyes forward, unwilling to glance at Gerard.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    I ll give you until the last thirty 
                    seconds. When that scoreboard clock 
                    begins counting down from thirty, 
                    if you haven t given me Derek, 
                    Jackson is going to kill someone.

      ON THE FIELD - Jackson lowers for the face-off.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    So tell me who s going to die 
                    tonight, Scott? Should it be your 
                    mother who so bravely came out to 
                    support you?

      IN THE BLEACHERS - an anxious Melissa glances about the 
      crowd.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Or the Sheriff? Your best friend s 
                    father?

      Nervous for his son, Stilinski can barely sit still.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Or how about the pretty little red-
                    head who managed to survive the 
                    bite of an Alpha?

      Arriving just in time, Lydia takes a seat next to Melissa, 
      giving her a smile.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)

      Danny holds his position at goal while Stiles nervously 
      bounces in place just ahead of him.

                    Or should I do everyone a favor and 
                    kill that ridiculous Coach?

      Gerard gives a polite nod to Coach as the man hurtles past 
      him, nervously pacing the sidelines.

                    It s up to you, Scott. But you are 
                    going to help me take Derek down.

      Anger rising with each breath, Scott looks like he might 
      explode off the bench.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Because if you don t...

                    field and drench everyone you love 
                    and care about in blood.

      THE WHISTLE BLOWS. The game begins.

      INT. HALE HOUSE - NIGHT3131*

      Glancing at his reflection in one of the mirrors, Peter blots *
      his bloody lip while a cautious Derek watches him.*

                    See? Prime example right here. I m

                    I m not as strong. I need a pack. I 
                    need an Alpha like you. I need you 
                    just as much as you need me.

                    Why would I want help from a total

                    First of all, I m not a total 
                    psycho. And by the way, you re the 
                    one who slashed my throat wide

      He cautiously approaches Derek, inching closer and closer.

                    We need each other. And sometimes 
                    when you need help, you turn to

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT3232

      Lydia gazes out on the field watching Stiles glance up in 
      shock as the BALL lands right in the pocket of his lacrosse 
      stick.

                                  STILES
                    Oh God.

      Before he can even turn around, a PLAYER rams into him. The 
      sound of CRUNCHING PADS brings audible groans from the crowd.

                                    MELISSA
                    He s probably just getting warmed 
                    up.

      At the next WHISTLE BLOW, Stiles races for the ball, slapping 
      helplessly at it while OPPOSING PLAYERS converge on him. 

      Another VICIOUS CRUNCH sets the crowd flinching back.

                                  LYDIA
                    He s just a little nervous. Plenty 
                    of time to turn it around.

      Another WHISTLE BLOW. Stiles tries to catch a pass, but the 
      ball BOUNCES right off his helmet.

      Melissa and Lydia look at each other, neither able to come up 
      with a new excuse. They turn to Stilinski, but he has his 
      head buried in his hands.

      AT THE BENCHES - Scott rises to his feet, eyes on the 
      scoreboard to see Beacon Hills down by several points.

                    I m aware of that. Now sit.

        Reluctantly, Scott eases back onto the bench just as a hand 
      reaches in to grab a helmet. He looks up in surprise at--              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1230.

      From the sidelines Gerard spots Isaac and Scott. The two boys 
      glance defiantly back at him, noticing that Gerard does not 
      look pleased by the surprise entrance. 

      Not pleased at all.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT3333

      Erica and Boyd charge through the shadows, darting past trees 
      and kicking up brush and leaves as they try to escape.

      But the ROAR of the ATV ENGINES bears down on them, closing 
      in. HEADLIGHTS whip across the trees, cutting through the 
      shadows just as--

                                  ARGENT
                    There!

      Argent aims a MAGLITE on the two running teenagers. But the 
      driver of the ATV is forced to slow as a throng of trees 
      looms ahead of them.

      Allison grabs the opportunity. When the ATV looks about to 
      stop, she jumps off.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    Allison, wait--

      But she s already hitting the ground, rolling with her BOW 
      pressed outward. She spins over the leaves and brush and 
      rises gracefully into a shooting stance.

      String pulled back, Allison lets an arrow fire.

      Ahead, Erica can t help but turn as she hears the sound of 
      something cutting through the air. She jolts back with a CRY 
      as the arrow goes into her leg and sends her tumbling to the 
      ground. 

      With a pained look she turns to see Boyd standing there in 
      fearful shock.

                                  ERICA

                    full of guys he can use before he 
                    ever puts me on the field.

      Isaac and Scott look over the players on the bench. Then 
      slowly turn to each other as if both coming to the same idea.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)

      past to take his position.

      Lowered for the face-off, Jackson turns an icy gaze on him. 
      But Isaac just winks back at him, eliciting a curious look 
      from Jackson.

      THE WHISTLE BLOWS and the ball drops. In the crash of 
      players, Isaac knocks a shoulder into a fellow Beacon Hills 
      TEAMMATE and sends him CRASHING to the dirt.

                    Ramirez! You re in.

      One of the three players on the bench gets up to race onto 
      the field while the injured TEAMMATE is helped past Scott.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1233.

      With another WHISTLE BLOW and another BRUTAL CRASH, a 2ND 
      TEAMMATE comes rolling toward Coach s feet. Bewildered, he 
      turns back to the bench again.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Murphy. You re in.

                    Lahey, what the hell s your 
                    problem?

      Isaac glances back at Coach and holds his hands up in 
      apology.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT3535

      Out of the smoke and fog, Allison walks calmly toward her 
      prey. With a cry of pain, Erica SNAPS the end of the arrow 
      off and staggers back to her feet.

      But Allison already has another arrow nocked. She FIRES.

      A HAND WHIPS OUT, catching the arrow just before it can hit 
      Erica. She gazes up at Boyd in front of her with a mixture of 
      relief and fear because--

      Allison FIRES again.

      Boyd isn t fast enough this time. The arrow goes right into 
      his stomach. He opens his mouth, SNARLING through fangs.

      Allison replies with another arrow.

      This one takes him in the thigh. But Boyd just SNARLS again. 
      He starts forward, charging toward Allison. Then snaps back 
      as another arrow goes right into him. And then another. And 
      another.

                                  ERICA
                    Stop!

      But looking frightfully cold, Allison already has a new arrow 
      drawn back.

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT3636

      Bodies CRASH into each other on the field. Among several 
      downed players, Isaac also hits the ground.

      Rolling to his feet, Jackson glances back, lips pulled 
      together in a devious smile. Because Isaac isn t getting up.

      Coach starts onto the field, but Scott hurries past, racing 
      to Isaac s side.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1234.

                    It s not broken. But I can t move 
                    it. I think Jackson nicked me. I 
                    can feel it spreading.

      While other players crowd around, Scott glances back to the 
      sidelines at Gerard whose VOICE comes whispering into his 
      ear.

                                  GERARD
                    You want to play chess, Scott? Then 
                    you better be willing to sacrifice 
                    your own pawns.

      Scott notices Jackson watching as Isaac is pulled onto a 
      stretcher.

      He turns and just barely catches his helmet thrown to him by 
      Coach.

                    Either you re in or we forfeit.

      With a nod, Scott pulls the helmet on. And a moment later, 
      he s down at a face-off with the opposing player.

      The WHISTLE BLOWS and Scott charges for the ball.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT3737

      On her feet, Erica limps forward, trying to reach Boyd as 
      Allison aims an arrow at him.

                                  ERICA
                    Don t. Allison, please.

      Without a hint of emotion, Allison lets her fingers part, 
      releasing the arrow when--

      A GUN FIRES.

      The arrow lands harmlessly in the ground. Allison looks to 
      the bow in her hands, grazed by a particularly well-aimed 
      bullet.

      Lowering his gun, Argent approaches with two hunters behind 
      him. But Boyd grabs their attention again as he takes a step 
      forward.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1235.

      Scott glances from the ball in the pocket of his lacrosse net 
      and then to the remarkably sized player known as the 
      Abomination racing toward him.

      Eyes barely having a second to widen in fear, Scott s feet 
      leave the ground. The ball bounces off into the grass. As 
      Scott goes down--

      Boyd hits the ground, a flurry of leaves and dust spinning up 
      around him.

      The stretcher that carried Isaac clatters to the floor. Half 
      paralyzed, the boy tries to crawl his way to the door, hands 
      digging at the cement floor.

      Behind him, an amused HUNTER watches him struggle to escape 
      while a SECOND hands Gerard the sheathed LONG SWORD used to 
      bisect the Omega.

                    It was a good effort, Isaac. It

      He slowly unsheathes the sword, eyeing its frighteningly 
      sharp edge as it glints in the moonlight.

      Then, with the crowd cheering, Coach screaming, and opposing

      at the goal.

      The world goes quiet. For a brief second, all that can be

                    anger, Derek. But the thing you 
                    lack most is a heart. It s why 
                    you ve always known you need Scott 
                    more than anyone. And even someone 
                    as burned and dead on the inside as 
                    me knows better than to 
                      underestimate the simple but 
                      undeniable power of human love.

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT5454

      World moving in a slow, dream-like quality, Stiles turns to 
      find Lydia watching him from the stands. Her gentle and 
      perfect smile now reserved for him. Finally, for him.

      The scoreboard reads Beacon Hills ahead by one. And only 
      THIRTY SECONDS LEFT.

      Scott hurries to the sidelines, eyes on the clock.               TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1242.

      CONTINUED:5454

      He spots Jackson still on the field. Then loses him behind 
      the moving players.

      TEN SECONDS left. The Ref slowly raises the whistle to his 
      lips.

      TWO LACROSSE GLOVES fall to the grass. Jackson s hands now 
      exposed, CLAWS at the tips of his fingers, murder in his 
      eyes.

      Scott spins, trying to find Jackson or even his intended 
      target as--

      THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK hits ZERO and the crowd goes ballistic. 
      Stilinski jumps to his feet, yanking Melissa into a hug. On *
      the field, Stiles grins as his teammates rally around him, 
      the hero of the game.

      Confused, Scott looks on the scoreboard clock.

                                  SCOTT
                          (to himself)
                    Nothing happened. Nothing...

      But then, one-by-one, the STADIUM LIGHTS CLICK OFF, plunging 
      the entire field into darkness. And in that sudden darkness--

      Someone SCREAMS.

      To be continued...

                                                                          FADE OUT:
