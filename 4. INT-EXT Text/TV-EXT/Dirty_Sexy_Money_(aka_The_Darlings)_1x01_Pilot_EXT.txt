      pockets and patches catching the pink and purple light. 

      We PULL UP to find a PRIVATE BLACK HELICOPTER flying low 
      across the water -- and NICK GEORGE, pensive in a perfect 
      suit, looking out from the backseat at the world blowing by.

                    Mister George?


      -- we let the helicopter speed away, towards the Statue of 
      Liberty -- the city of Manhattan -- and the setting sun. 


      The helicopter lands. Nick gets out and ducks his way under 
      the spinning rotors until he s met by BRUNO, his DRIVER.  "The Darlings" by Craig Wright - Network Draft - 01/03/07    2.

                    Thanks, Bruno.

      They shake hands and then head for the Heliport Building.

                    Did you see a woman? Dark hair? 

      The Rev. Brian Darling comes outside.

                    Nick, wait a minute --

                    What?

                    Brian, I really can t deal with you 
                    right now, okay? Trust me!

                                  NICK
                    Brian, I just told you, I can t 
                    deal with this right now!

                                  BRIAN
                    But you can take our family s money 
                    and show up here like you belong? 
                    You re on the clock, Nick, answer 
                    my (fucking) question!

      Nick considers bringing up the truth -- then walks away.

                    Where do you think you re going?

                    I quit. I QUIT!

                                  BRIAN
                    Good! Good riddance! I tried for 
                    years to get Dad to pick that 
                    leech, your father, off his ass!

      Nick stops -- OH FUCK, THAT WAS THE WRONG THING TO SAY --

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    We re better off without you!

      Nick turns and runs at Brian -- who runs inside -- SCREAMING!

                    DON T HIT THE FACE, NOT THE FACE!


      Nick s just walking uphill from the TUNNEL near W. 80th, to 
      the sound of MANY BEEPING CAR HORNS.

                                  NICK (V.O.)
                    And I walked home through the park. 
                    And when I hit Central Park West, I 
                    saw the damnedest thing.

      Nick crests the hill and sees SOMETHING.

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    Holy crap.

      There, IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION, surrounded by JAMMED 
      TRAFFIC and TERRIFIED ONLOOKERS -- is a KOMODO DRAGON. 

      It s stalking around, hissing: A veritable DINOSAUR.

      Nick walks closer and steps up beside a CABBIE (East Indian, 
      20 s, with turban and beard.)

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    What s going on?

                                  CABBIE
                    It must have escaped from the zoo.

                    How?

                                  CABBIE
                    I have no idea. The police say 
                    Animal Control is on the way.

                                  NICK
                    And they ll take it back?

                                  CABBIE
                    Perhaps. They may have to kill it.

      ONLOOKERS SCREAM when the dragon takes a few steps closer.

      Nick and Karen are walking by THE RESERVOIR.

                                  NICK
                    So -- help me understand this.

                    I run the family s foundation.

                    I know, you gave me the check --

                                  KAREN
                    And the way it usually works is 
                    just like that -- family members 
                    fill out requisition forms and I 
                    send out the checks.

                                  NICK 
                    And so what does this have to do --

                    party. He wants to join some golf

                                  KAREN
                    Yeah. That s why. Anyway, I went to 
                    the office to write him the check. "The Darlings" by Craig Wright - Network Draft - 01/03/07    57.

                    What?

                    The last gift Brian requisitioned 
                    from the foundation was for this 
                    guy, Fred Exley. Brian said he was 
                    a family man who came into the 
                    church one day, down on his luck, 
                    and needed to cover some debts. I 
                    sent him $10,000 three months ago.

                    And you just got another 
                      requisition from Brian...
