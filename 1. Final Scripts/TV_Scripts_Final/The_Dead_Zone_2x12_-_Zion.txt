                                              TEASER

          FADE IN:

  11INT. ZION CHURCH - CLOSE UP - A ROW OF LARGE, FANCY
          LADIES' HATS

          Seen from behind as we pan across, then move to reveal
          the faces of the ladies themselves: African-American,
            middle-aged, formidable, fanning themselves with hand-
          held fans, staring forward with anticipation.  Sunday-
          Best clothing, 1981.


          ANGLE - THE PULPIT

          A low podium, fronted by a seated row of six African
          American men in their twenties, in period suits and shades.


          ANGLE - A TEN YEAR OLD BOY

          Wearing a dazzling white suit steps up to the pulpit,
          almost casually.  He exchanges a glance with his father --
          a large, imposing African-American PASTOR sitting next to
          pulpit.  The older man nods his permission to begin.  The
          boy turns to his audience, voice clear and calm.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                        Our subject today... the End of
                        the World.

          He takes a deep breath -- not that he needs to, this is
          part of the style and the rhythm of the sermon.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                          I beheld an Angel...

            Immediately, scattered voices respond "Amen" "Uh-huh"
          "Praise the Lord" "Hallelujah" "Glory" "That's right"
          "Preach it" -- and will continue to do so for the rest of
          the sermon as the Spirit moves them.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                        I said I beheld an Angel...

          The responses get more energetic.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                        And he broke the seal...

          He steps aside from the pulpit so he can be fully seen.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - TEASER - 2/10/03 - BLUE          2.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                          I beheld an Angel and he broke
                        the seal...

          He puts his hand on his hip.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                        Come and see...

            A breath.


          REVEAL JOHNNY SMITH

          Sitting in a pew.  The only White face in the entire
          church.  This is a Dead Zone vision we are watching. 
          Johnny glances over at a woman (Clara Johnson) in a big
          church hat fanning herself next to him.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                          I beheld an Angel and he broke
                        the seal... said...


          RESUME THE BOY PREACHER

            Including his father...

                                        BOY BRUCE & PASTOR
                                (in unison)
                        Come and see...

          Breath.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                        He said Come and see...

          Breath.

                                        BOY BRUCE & PASTOR
                        Come and see...

          The people in front of him are on their feet, the crowd
          is shouting louder now.


          JOHNNY 

          watches the boy preacher, whose voice is steadily building,
          carrying the worshipers up with him.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                          I beheld the sun, black as
                          sackcloth...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - TEASER - 2/10/03 - BLUE          3.


  1CONTINUED: (2)1

          Voices joining --

                                        BOY BRUCE & PASTOR
                        Come and see...

          His voice goes louder, more rapid, keeping out in front.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                        And the moon became as blood...

          The words pour out in a rush. 

                                        BOY BRUCE
                          I beheld the sun, black as
                          sackcloth... And the moon became
                        as blood... And in Heaven there
                        was Silence.

          End vision --


  22INT. ZION CHURCH - DAY - ON JOHNNY

          Sitting in the same pew as above.  Silent.  Johnny glances
          up --


          JOHNNY'S POV - BRUCE

          Standing at the front of the church, at the pulpit, by an
          open casket.  Completing some comments.

                                        BRUCE
                        I wish I could find the words. 
                        After so much time.    

          The Pastor from the vision is lying in state -- twenty-
          five years older, but still imposing, still recognizable
          as the same man.

                                        BRUCE
                        My father would want me to give a
                        sermon.  As he taught me.  But it
                        doesn't really go with the haircut,
                        Daddy.

          It's an odd time for a joke, not entirely inappropriate,
          but it does reveal a trace of guilt and separation.  There
          are no laughs.  And Bruce really feels out of place and
            uncomfortable and decides to wrap this up.

                                        BRUCE
                        I... thank you all for coming.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - TEASER - 2/13/03 - YELLOW        4.


    2CONTINUED:2

          He steps away and the guests are disappointed but forgiving
          in this circumstance.  Bruce moves beside his sixty year
          old mother MRS. LEWIS, comforting her as people move
          forward and line up to pay their respects... 


          RESUME

          As Johnny stands and moves to get in line.


  33MOMENTS LATER - ON BRUCE

          As Johnny moves to him in line...

                                        BRUCE
                        Thanks for coming back with me,
                        John.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods with sympathy)
                        I found out more about you in the
                        last two hours than you've told
                        me in the last two years.

                                        BRUCE
                                  (acknowledges)
                        Lot of ghosts here.  Starting
                        with me.

          They embrace as good friends would in this situation. 
          And as they do, 180 DEGREE RAMP TO JOHNNY...


  44VISION - SERIES OF EXTREME CLOSE UPS, SLOW-MOTION,
            VERTIGINOUS:

          -- a hand gun firing up (toward a catwalk)...

          -- a bloody hand ripping a red, white and blue bunting
          draped across the front of the catwalk... as someone

          -- the floor below... as feet scatter to reveal Johnny

          crazed eyes in shock, glazing over, dying... and if that

          over him.  Johnny turns to the Pastor and their eyes
          connect (and this transcends the moment as though Johnny
          in the vision has an awareness of the unusual presence of
          the pastor).

          THE VISION ENDS.


  77INT. ZION CHURCH - DAY - RESUME

          Johnny lets go.  They BOTH look dazed.

                                        BRUCE
                        Man, the Zone must be in overdrive
                        today.

          Johnny just looks at him, what's he mean?  Bruce raises a
          hand up to his temple.

                                        BRUCE
                        I could feel you having a vision. 
                        That never happened before.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                                (murmurs)
                        Let's keep moving please.

          As Johnny starts to move away...

                                        BRUCE
                                (sotto)
                        Tell me you saw us on a plane
                        going home tomorrow.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not exactly.

          Johnny glances down at the man in the coffin -- the same
          man he just saw praying over his dying body.  OFF the
          mystery of the situation.

          FADE IN:

  88EXT. ZION CHURCH - DAY

            Establish a modest place of worship in a residential/urban
            neighborhood, with a large sign over the front door:
          "Church of the Voice of Zion."

          A small house for the Pastor is attached directly to the
          side of the church, allowing passage between.


  99INT. PASTOR'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          The reception after the funeral service... casual food
          and drinks on a buffet table... finding Bruce with a
            community DOCTOR... we'll call him MCCANTS.... (his wife
          is also in the room, chatting with someone near-by)...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        It's what he would have wanted.

                                        BRUCE
                        Doctor McCants, my father and
                        I... we...
                                (never saw eye to eye
                                on this subject)

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                                (overlapping)
                        He told it to your mother on his
                          deathbed, Bruce.  I was there.

                                        BRUCE
                                (quiet, uncomfortable)
                        I'm no preacher...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                          I brought you into this world
                        with my two hands.  And I swear
                        to God I think you came out of
                        your mama's womb a preacher -
                        natural born.  I've never seen
                        anyone who had the gift like you
                        had as a boy.  It's a sin to waste
                        it.  It's what your father would
                        say.  

                                        BRUCE
                                (mostly to himself)
                        Yup.  He would all right.

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        Your mother tells me you've lived
                        in a dozen different cities since
                        you left... somewhere in Maine,
                        right now, isn't it...

                                        BRUCE
                                (trying to change the
                                  subject)
                        I like being mobile... it's the
                        great thing about being a physical
                          therapist...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        Could you be any farther from
                        home?  Did you stop running away
                        from Indiana when you reached the
                          Atlantic ocean?

          Bruce looks around for an escape to this conversation...

                                        BRUCE
                        Have you tried the chicken?  Mrs.
                        Krasner brought it...

          McCants holds Bruce's arm as he tries to move away...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        What are you searching for, Bruce? 
                        And couldn't you find it here...
                        with your mother... carrying on
                        your father's fine work... cause
                        she's going to lose it if you
                          don't... she will lose the church
                        and the house...

                                        BRUCE
                                (dry)
                        Thank you for making sure I
                        understood that...

          A man (ALVIN) and his attractive wife (NORMA), both about
          Bruce's age... move to him as he moves away from McCants...

                                        ALVIN
                        Long time, bro.

                                        BRUCE
                        Alvin, too long.

          They hug as old friends...

                                        ALVIN
                        I'm so sorry it has to be for
                        this.  Hey, I want you to meet my
                        wife, Norma.

                                        BRUCE
                          I didn't even know you were
                          married.

          Shakes her hand.

                                        NORMA
                        I'm sorry for your loss.

          There's nothing unique about this meeting, strictly
            perfunctory, funeral talk.


          NEW ANGLE

          Johnny is standing with Bruce's mother at the gathering.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Is there a special lady in his
                        life?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They're all special--

          Johnny catches himself.  He doesn't want to give the wrong
          impression, even if it's the right impression.

                                        JOHNNY
                        --I mean...

          But Mrs. Lewis has just stopped a Young Woman serving
          appetizers from a tray.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Go back and forth like a typewriter
                        you'll cover the room much faster
                        than if you just drift.  

          Mrs. Lewis makes the movement with her finger in the air.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Back and forth and back and forth.

          The Young Woman acknowledges and moves quickly away. 
          Mrs. Lewis turns again to Johnny.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Does he talk about us?

                                        JOHNNY
                        All the time.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                                (even)
                        It takes more time to lie than to
                        tell the truth, Mister Smith.

          She doesn't hesitate to ask provocative questions --

                                        MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
                        Are there any other black people
                        there?  In Maine?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not a lot.

          She thinks about that...

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Is he happy?

          Johnny studies this formidable woman.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Miz Lewis, he's been a great
                        friend.  But he's not a man to
                        show his feelings, at least not
                        to me.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Covers them with a joke, I'll
                        bet.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods)
                        To be honest, after today, I
                        realize I don't know him nearly
                        as well as I thought.  I want to
                        change that.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Now, that's an honest answer.

          She looks across the room at Bruce who looks uncomfortable
          dealing with all the hugs that people want to give him...

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                                (beat, thoughtful)
                        I don't think he knows himself
                        any better than you know him, Mr.
                        Smith.

          Then she smiles gently.

                        Thank you for being his friend.

          As she's about to move away, she puts an intimate hand on
          his forearm in a gesture of appreciation... on her touch,
          RAMP TO HIS FACE...


  1010VISION - MATCH CUT - JOHNNY'S FACE AS WE SAW IT BEFORE IN
          THE VISION - ON THE FLOOR... DYING... 

          As before, he turns and makes eye contact with Bruce's
          father who prays over him... this time at normal speed,
          we can hear chaos in the walla off camera... there seems
          to be a big crowd... people running, maybe someone at a
          loudspeaker telling everyone to be calm and exit in an
          orderly fashion... but this is a two shot between Johnny
          and Pastor Lewis...

                                        PASTOR
                        Deliver him from his sins and let

          The vision ends...

          To find Johnny alone... staring at the corpse of Bruce's
            father... wondering what his vision meant... he slowly
          reaches out... to touch the body... both afraid and
          curious...

          Touches the chest... and it ignites a vision --

          ANGLE - SPLIT REALITY - 

          Bruce has a duffel, short hair, and is now wearing casual
          clothes circa 1992.  He's leaving home.  His father stands
          in his way.

                        I lost my faith in God a long
                        time ago.

          The Pastor slaps Bruce hard across the face.  The duffel
          falls to the ground.

                        You will.

                          Armageddon?  The end is near? 
                        Please.  How can you possibly
                        believe anything we preach every
                        Sunday.

                                        PASTOR
                                (simple, honest)
                        I read the morning paper.  And I
                        have faith in the teachings...

                          I don't.

          Younger Bruce picks up the duffel in defiance... opens
          the door... he stares at his father a long beat, weighing
          his choices.

                                        PASTOR
                        Deny your destiny, you deny God
                          Himself.  And me.

          Young Bruce finally decides...

                        Nobody has a destiny.  We're all
                        just stumbling around in the dark.

          And exits.  We stay a beat on the pastor who is controlled
          but devastated... and although it must be a coincidence,
          he seems to look over in Johnny's direction... not eye
          contact per se... but almost an awareness...

                                        BRUCE
                                (entering from the
                                  party)
                        There you are.

          And unlike most visions... this one lingers as the scene
          in real time continues... the Pastor never disappears... 
          he sits in a pew and looks sadly straight ahead, perhaps
          praying to himself; he doesn't pay attention to Johnny
          and Bruce and how could he - he's in the past... a vision,
          nothing more...

                                        BRUCE
                        You told my mom there are no black
                        people in Maine and now she's
                        worried about me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think she's worried about you
                        for a lot of reasons.

          Bruce doesn't want to confront his feelings about all
          this... he puts some distance between him and Johnny...
          walks over and looks at the cross... 

                                        BRUCE
                        Why is everyone worried about me; 
                        I got a job, an apartment, a lot
                        of good white friends...
                                (beat)
                        They want me to come home... save
                        the church... like I owe it to
                        him... maybe I do...

          His father doesn't look at him; he doesn't see his father. 
          The pastor just looks ahead sadly, continuing a silent
          prayer.  

                                        BRUCE
                        It feels like he's in the room
                        with us.  I think I must be into
                        my own Dead Zone today.

          Sighs uncomfortable, stands again...

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        Cause I feel him... trying to
                        pull me back...

          He moves to the casket... looks at the quiet figure of
          his father...

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                          Reaching out from that casket.

          He reaches out and touches his father's cheek...

                                        BRUCE
                        I could never touch him like this
                        when he was alive... it was too
                          personal, you know?  It was too...


          THE PASTOR

          stands, mind working.  A tear rolls down his cheek.


          BRUCE

          studies the body.  And a parallel tear runs down his
          cheek...

                        I'm sorry I let you down, Daddy.

          And Johnny moves to comfort his friend, puts a hand on
          his shoulder... while Bruce still is touching his father's
          cheek... (note: it is important that we emphasize this is
          a three-way connection - not just between Johnny and Bruce
          but between Bruce and the body of his father as well) and
          on Johnny's touch... RAMP TO JOHNNY'S HAND... THEN RAMP
          TO THE PASTOR AND BRUCE'S HAND...

          CLOSE ON BRUCE'S FACE... HIS HEAD FEELS LIKE IT'S SPLITTING
          OPEN... he grabs his head... groans... AND WE TURN 180
          DEGREES AS BRUCE'S EYES CONNECT WITH JOHNNY'S EYES...  
          suddenly Johnny's head snaps back as a vision HITS HIM...
          A CLEAR CONNECTION BETWEEN BRUCE AND JOHNNY IS THUS

                                (in pain)
                          Something's wrong.  Something's
                        wrong.

                          Headache again? 

          Younger Bruce nods silently, almost incapacitated with
          the pain.  His father moves to him and closes the door... 
          Bruce never gets to leave this time... the father puts
          his arm around the son and they exit toward the corridor
          behind the pulpit.

                                        PASTOR
                        It will pass.  As all things do.
                        God will show us the way. 
                        Everything will be all right now.

          They walk by Bruce in the present... and our angle gives
          an extreme closeup of Bruce...

                                        BRUCE
                        But this isn't how it happened...
                        John, this isn't...

          But as he turns, there is no Johnny - and in fact, the
          moment Younger Bruce did not leave, Johnny was gone...
          and more has changed as well... Bruce's hair is shorter,
          more conservative but he still has a beard (to help
          distinguish him from the younger Bruce we just saw and
            establish this as a present day alternate reality - in
          other words, he doesn't look that much different here.)

          And the casket is gone too.  And he's wearing a preacher's

  2121EXT. CHURCH OF ZION - DAY - ALT. REALITY

          Bruce rushes out --  He looks wildly around for Johnny --
          but instead, his eyes find a pasteboard sign that reads:

            Parishioners are beginning to arrive...

  2222EXT. CHURCH - AS BEFORE - DAY

          Bruce is not feeling at all well... (it could be a
            lingering headache from the vision or as we will find
          out, it could also be the effects of a hangover); he puts
          some distance between himself and the people...

                        Okay, John.  I'm hoping somehow
                        you can hear me... because I may
                        be caught in one of your visions
                        here... like our Zones have fused
                          together or something... but it's
                        a very strange vision... cause 
                        I've seen things that never
                          happened, John...  I never went
                        out the door, never left home...
                        and, and I think you may be in
                          trouble, John, cause I saw someone
                        shoot you... talk to me, John, I
                        need you...

                                        BRUCE
                        We haven't talked for awhile is
                        all.

          The pastor looks curiously at Bruce... McCants gives the
          father a look... the boy is acting strangely...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        I think the elder might do well
                        in moderating his Saturday nights
                        before his Sunday mornings.

                                        PASTOR
                        Go sit down and mind your business,
                        Doctor.

          McCants takes an affront, humphs, and goes inside...

          A moment alone, the Pastor gives his son a sharply critical

                                (sotto)
                        You don't think people notice?

                                        BRUCE
                        Notice?

                                        PASTOR
                        You just pull it together before
                        the service.  And use eye drops
                        before you go see your mother.

          Other PARISHIONERS including Alvin and Norma are arriving
          now, effectively ending the communication...

                          Morning.

          Nothing at all abnormal about the greeting and yet the
          Pastor looks at Norma with an extra half beat; we barely
          notice - she either doesn't notice or ignores it and moves
          inside.  Bruce has so many things he wants to say to his
            father...

                                        BRUCE
                        Daddy, I...

                        Your mother's waiting for you.

          Bruce studies the face of the man... he almost reaches
          out and touches him... but can't... and moves inside...


  2323INT. CHURCH OFFICE - DAY - ALT REALITY

          Bruce's mother is helping him on with his robe in
          preparation for Sunday Service.  He is objecting even as
          he gets ready to go through with it.

                                        BRUCE
                        I can't do this.

  2424INT. CHURCH OF ZION - DAY - ALT. REALITY

          Bruce is moving toward the front of the Church, barely
          able to look at the packed house.  His father is seated
          among the other men flanking the pulpit.  Bruce reaches
          it, then turns toward his father, who nods.  Bruce faces
          the throng.

                                        BRUCE
                        How y'all doin today?

          Silence.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm feeling kind of strange myself.

          From the crowd: "Amen."

                                        BRUCE
                        No, I mean, I'm really feeling
                        kind of strange.

          "Preach it!"  "Uh huh!"  The shouts encourage him, seem
          to loosen him up.  Bruce looks down and sees Clara the
          hat lady with a monster hat on... laughs...

                                        BRUCE
                        Mz.  Johnson, it's good to see
                        some things never change.  Folks
                        behind you ought to be given
                          'obstructed view' tickets.

          Laughs from the PARISHIONERS.  Bruce finds himself relaxing
          into it.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm going to just go with this if
                        you don't mind.  Try to get into
                        the zen of the moment. 
                                (off confused faces)
                        Well, maybe we'll hold off on the
                        zen for now.

          Takes a deep breath and looks over at his father who looks
          at him curiously... this is not the usual sermon...

                          Misunderstandings That Divide

                        lot about... a lot about...

          "Praise God", "Hallelujah"...  The connection continues
          between father and son... and we should cut away to see
          mom too as she watches this unfold...

                        Because misunderstandings can
                        drive families apart... far
                          apart... until it's too late to
                        do anything about them...

          "Praise God"... and the father isn't sure yet... is this

          And the men in front stand, whooping, ready to rock...
          And the room starts moving to the rhythms of the gospel
          being preached... responses get more energetic...

                        that will rain down on mankind... 

          "I have seen the angel!", "Amen", "Hallelujah"... The
          crowd is shouting louder now. 

                                        BRUCE
                        I have seen the angel who would

          Clara Johnson in a big hat is fanning herself...

          Someone in the crowd starts singing a gospel song in low

          "We want a sign, John"... "Glory"... the singing ratchets
          up to match his growing intensity, his voice escalates to
          pull them further.  A woman suddenly stands and screams
            ecstatically, almost painfully, overcome with emotion,
          stomping her feet and jabbing her arms into the air with
          her screams.  A woman in a nurse's uniform rushes in to
          attend to her... grabbing her, fanning her... (and this
          sort of display is not unexpected, it's encouraged)... 
          It's a bedlam of charismatic energy.  But Bruce is worried
          and confused and looks up as though to heaven or up from
          his own darkness...

          His father studies him curiously as the room around him
          is about to explode...

          Bruce watches with very mixed feelings on his face.  Part
          of him loves being here at this family tradition he
            abandoned a decade ago, part of him is overwhelmed by the
            weirdness of it all and the mystery of why it is happening.

                        their own history, culture and

                        Well if no one else is going to
                        say it, I will - I thought it was
                        one of the best sermons I ever
                          heard...

                        I'm a little out of practice.  I
                        mean, I didn't get much time to
                          practice it this week.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Well, it was heartfelt.

                        such an interest in John the
                          Baptist.

          We move down on Norma to find her knee under the table...
          it moves over and rubs against Bruce's knee...

                        I think she feeds that hat.

          She tries not to laugh.  She doesn't like to think of
          herself as gossiping.


          BRUCE'S KNEE

          Moves away from Norma's... Norma's knee pursues...

                        hot air in.

          Bruce doesn't know quite what to do - his father ends it
          with...

                        Have some iced Tea.

          Bruce sits, reluctantly... and we can only guess what's
          going on under the table... Norma's left hand is still
          under there... as she demurely eats her supper...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        The boy may be coming down with
                        something.

                          Everybody's got something... and
                        they all bring it to church with
                        them.

          But Bruce glances over and sees his father studying him
          and Norma... his father knows something is going on under
          the table... Bruce abruptly gets up again...

                                        BRUCE
                        You know, I just remembered... I
                        have to make a phone call.

          And moves out of the room.  Everyone is perplexed.

  2626INT. CHURCH OFFICE - DAY - ALT. REALITY

          Bruce is in the small office linking the house to the
          church.  He's pacing, agitated, holding the phone in hand
          as it rings a number he has just dialed.

                        Okay, John... maybe it's like

  2727EXT. MAINE STREET - A CROWD - ON A SIDEWALK - CHEERING -
          DAY - ALT REALITY

          On the street, ten or so motorcycles are riding by in an
          ad hoc parade... the riders are neat, each wearing white
          shirts and clean bluejeans... but the cycles have been
          customized beyond recognition...

          Hear a cell phone beneath the din... moving through the
          millworkers and college crowd, all of them wearing Stillson
          buttons, many waving signs... to find Johnny Smith but
          not the Johnny Smith we know and love... this is the Johnny
          Smith from the novel, the movie... this is an assassin...
          he looks for all the world like Arthur Bremer stalking
          George Wallace... neat, a little too neat, a little
          desperation in his eyes... not cheering while all the
          others cheer around him... "Go-get-'em, Greg"... people
          are looking at him because of the phone ringing which
          makes him nervous... the phone finally stops ringing...
          and he smiles uncomfortably at someone who is staring at
          him...

          A big bass drum and here's the (small) Trimbull High School
          Marching Band... Greg Stillson darting along with the
          band, slapping the tuba player on the back with glee...

          And to paraphrase Mr. King:

          "The crowd is screaming his name, chanting it: GREG...
          GREG... GREG...

          "The young guy who had billeted his family next to Johnny
          is holding his son up over his head so the kid can see. 
          A young man with a large, puckered burn scar on one side
          of his face is  waving a sign that says: "LIVE FREE OR
          DIE, HERE'S GREG IN YER EYE!"  An achingly beautiful girl
          of maybe eighteen is waving a chunk of watermelon and
          pink juice is running down her arm.  It is mass confusion. 
          Excitement is humming through the crowd like a series of
          high voltage electrical cables."

          Greg rushes over, remarkably close to Johnny - not
          recognizing him (never having seen him before).  A fat
          woman grabs him around the neck and kisses him... Stillson
            laughs...

                        You bet I'll remember you, hon.

          SONNY ELLIMAN is directing the motorcycle riders to keep
          people at bay... pulling the fat woman away...

          Johnny gets a glimpse of SARAH in the Stillson entourage...
          and then suddenly his cell phone rings again... the sound
          brings Sarah's attention to him... and she sees who it is
          of course... and immediately turns away... genuinely
          distressed any time she sees him.

          The crowd lurches and suddenly Johnny finds himself face
          to face with Stillson who smiles at him...

                                        STILLSON
                        Hey, man, hope you're gonna support
                        us.

          And shakes his hand and RAMP TO JOHNNY'S FACE...

                        Dammit, John, answer the phone.

          He slams the phone down, turns and sees his father standing
          at the door.

          The Pastor comes in and sits down.

                        Can we talk?  You said before, we
                        haven't talked for awhile.  And
                        that's true.  I miss it.

                                        PASTOR
                        You're talking in circles.

          The Pastor studies him with concern... this is not the
          son he knows... this son is acting strangely...

                        me to believe you've been, what,
                        'born again'?

          A beat.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's closer to the truth than
                        either of us could possibly
                          believe.

                                        PASTOR
                        Excuse me if I find it hard to
                        accept a day after Officer Lorber
                        brings you home at three a.m.
                        covered in your own vomit.  And
                        then sitting at your mama's supper
                        table today watching you and
                        Alvin's missus pretending nothing's
                        going on which I know it is.  And
                        she isn't the first lonely wife
                        in this parish you've fooled with.

          Bruce reacts, tries to absorb all this.  He stands, shakes
          his head, thinking: could this be me?

                                        BRUCE
                                (mostly to himself)
                        Next week's sermon will be about
                        "the road not taken."

                                        PASTOR
                        The road...?

          Bruce studies his father with a heavy heart... unable to
          explain but needing to reach out to his father in a way
          he never could in his real life...

                                        BRUCE
                        I am different today.  In more
                        ways than I can explain.

                                  himself as he looks

                                eyes)
                        ...As though the search for meaning
                        itself would somehow bring me
                        closer to you.

                        I... see myself through your eyes,
                        Daddy.  I want you to be proud of
                        me.  No matter what else happens, 
                        I'm glad I had the chance to tell
                        you.

          It is an extraordinary thing for a son to tell his
            father... and completely out of character for the Bruce
          he's known... the Pastor studies him as puzzled as can
          be.


  3131INT. FOYER - NIGHT - ALT REALITY

          Bruce moves quietly down the stairs, a duffel bag slung
          over his shoulder, a man ready to go somewhere... as he
          moves to leave, he pauses as he sees some photos of himself
          and the family on the wall... studying a picture of the
          Pastor and Baby Bruce for a moment.  Then he looks back
          up the stairs, says a silent good-bye and moves out of
          view.

          We don't see the house yet.  A cab pulls to the curb...
          Bruce looks out the window... reacts...

                                        BRUCE
                        Wait here.

          Moving with Bruce as he walks us into our view of the
          house --  past the "Keep Off Property" sign in the yard,
          a look of concern on his face.  He takes in the front of
          the house -- the windows covered with boards and the heavy-
          duty Realtor's lockbox on the front door.

  3535INT. FAITH HERITAGE AUDITORIUM - DAY - ALT. REALITY

          Reverend GENE PURDY is moving with Bruce through the
          interior... where red, white and blue banners are being
          set up along with Stillson signs and paraphernalia.  Around
          them, Faith Heritage students work to set up the chairs
          and check the podium sound system in preparation for the
          opening session.

                                        PURDY
                        Sorry for the turmoil but we're
                          preparing for a rally - there's a
                        wild Congressional election in
                        Maine this year... we have old
                          Harrison Fisher shaking in his
                        boots over our boy Greg Stillson...

                                        BRUCE
                        I've heard of him.

                                        PURDY
                        All the way in Indianapolis? 
                        That's very encouraging.

          Purdy stops an Assistant going by...

                                        PURDY
                        Our balloons haven't arrived;
                        find out where our balloons are.

          The Assistant nods and moves off.

                                        PURDY
                          Now,then, what would a man of God
                        want with Johnny Smith?

                                (casually)
                        I have an interest in psychic
                        phenomena.

                                        PURDY
                        Elder Lewis, there are psychics
                        and there are psychotics.

                        the former.

          Purdy can't keep the anger out of his voice.

                        me over his mother's estate... In
                        a coma for six years... not a day

                        Mark deCastrique down at the bus
                        station says he bought a ticket

          She acknowledges, troubled.

                                (joking)

                                        BRUCE
                          Something like that.

                                        STILLSON
                        Got a thousand bucks?  That's
                        what he charges.  The man gives
                        me the willies.

          He twirls a finger at his head to indicate Johnny is crazy.

                                        STILLSON
                                (moving away, smiling)
                        Good luck.  See you in Indiana in
                        a few years.

          Sarah's fingering through a rolodex... pulls out a card
          with Johnny Smith's name and address...

                                        SARAH
                        This is the last address of his I
                        have.  You can keep that.  I don't
                        need it any more.

          As Bruce reacts...


  3838EXT. SMALL HOUSE - CLEAVES MILLS - DAY - ALT. REALITY

          Bruce stands at the door of a modest, slightly run-down
          house, knocking loudly on the door.

                                        BRUCE
                        John!  Open the door!

          He puts his ear to the door -- nothing.  He looks around,
          tries the doorknob -- it's locked.  Thinks for a moment.


  3939INT. SMALL HOUSE - CLEAVES MILLS - DAY - ALT. REALITY

          The window breaks from the outside, and Bruce crawls
          through, pushing past the heavy plastic blackout sheet
          that covers the window.  All the windows are so covered,
          leaving the apartment disturbingly dark, even in mid-day.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - ACT THREE - 2/10/03 - BLUE      39.


    39CONTINUED:39

          A computer screen adds some light to the room.  Bruce is
          amazed at what he finds -- the place is like Johnny's
          "threat board" basement times ten.  And we do an extended
          MONTAGE as Bruce examines Stillson pics and articles are
          pinned and taped and strewn about on all available
            surfaces.  If the basement indicated a potential stalker
          mentality, this looks to be many degrees darker.  Among
          the pictures: photos of famous assassinations... some
          with progressive time lapse shots: Dealy plaza... arrows
            superimposed on where the shots were and may have been
          fired from... George Wallace ambushed by Arthur Bremer...
          Martin Luther King's death scene... Huey Long's photo...
          John Hinkley and Ronald Reagan...  Oswald in his death
          growl as he's shot by Jack Ruby... very disturbing
            images... and notebooks... one is opened to a page and a
          line is written with a triple circle around it as though
          to keep it in: "If you could jump into a time machine and
          go back to 1932, would you kill Hitler?" 

          But there's more -- as he moves into the bedroom, he finds
          a shell casing on a desk... from some kind of rifle...
          and as he opens a closet... he finds guns... a whole mess
          of guns... and ammunition... Bruce's face is filled with
            horror...

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        What are you doing here?

          Bruce turns to see our alternate Johnny staring at him,
          deceptively calm and controlled...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Who are you? 

                                        BRUCE
                        John, oh man, am I glad I found
                        you.  I've been looking
                          everywhere...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do I know you?

                                        BRUCE
                        Yes.  Only you don't remember.  I
                          remember.  I don't know why I
                          remember but I do.  My name is
                        Bruce Lewis.  Does that sound at
                        all familiar to you?

          It doesn't.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bannerman sent you, didn't he...

                          Something has gone terribly wrong. 
                        A Dead Zone implosion.  I... we...
                        are either trapped in one of your

                        think, John... try to remember...

                        Look, just, just touch me... and
                        maybe you'll see... you'll see
                        what I'm talking about... maybe
                        it'll even break the spell...

          Johnny just stares at him evenly... Bruce takes the bull
          by the horns and moves to him... grabs his arm... we hear
          a DZ sound effect...

                        angel.'  You're a preacher.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm not a preacher.  I'm a physical
                        therapist.  I was your physical
                          therapist before everything
                          changed.  This isn't you.

                        isn't you, John... it's the you
                        that would have been if I hadn't
                        been there...  

          As he says the above, he makes a point of moving around
          picking up paraphernalia, ammunition...

          displaying the Faith Heritage website announcing the
          evening rally for Greg Stillson.  He sees a blueprint of
          the Faith Heritage Auditorium on the desk next to the
          screen.  He suddenly realizes what's about to happen.

                          morning, Pastor Lewis.  On a
                        dubious mission.

                        Local man who claims to have
                        psychic powers.  Your son said he
                        had an interest in the subject.

          The crowd is still going wild... the band is playing...
          balloons and sparkling confetti is falling from the
          ceiling...

          In the midst of all this visual texture, confetti, balloons
          falling... we're intercutting action... so it's not just
          a flat shot here... a flat shot there... it's almost
          surreal... a nightmare...

          The Pastor reacts as he sees --


  5050LONG SHOT - HIS POV - BRUCE

            entering, moving quickly among the crowd... looking in
          this fog of excitement for Johnny... he pauses to say
            something we can't hear to a Security Guard who looks
            concerned... talks into a walkie-talkie...          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - ACT FOUR - 2/13/03 - YELLOW     45.


  5151THE PASTOR

          way on the other side of the auditorium - through the
          confetti... moves through the confetti toward him... it
          isn't easy with the crowds of people between them...


  51A51AINT. CATWALK - JOHNNY

          Lying flat on his back on a bare floor, staring straight
          up into camera.  He holds the rifle horizontally across
          his chest.  From this overhead angle, body and rifle form
          the unmistakable shape of the crucifix.  The SOUND of a
          microphone coming to life.


  51B51BTHE STAGE

          Stillson climbs the stairs, still waving to the crowd,
          and they roar as though his rise to the stage is an
            accomplishment of sorts...  Purdy has moved on stage to
          greet Stillson... they shake hands, wave... Purdy moves
          to the podium... 

                                        PURDY
                        God bless you.  God bless you all
                        for coming.  And God bless Greg
                          Stillson!

          More cheers... more music... more chaos...  Finding
          Bruce... Security people talking on headphones...


  5252JOHNNY

          Moves to his knees and lifts his rifle...


          THE BUTT OF THE RIFLE

          Thuds as it sockets home next to the shoulder joint,
          chambering a round, the cheers of the audience covering 
          the metallic kerchang of the rifle.


    5353STILLSON

          Arms raised in victory... as Purdy smiles and whispers
            something to Sarah...

                                        STILLSON
                        God bless you too!  Back at you!

          Yaay!, goes the crowd... Elliman gets a call on his
          earphone... his eyes show concern... look out to the
          crowd... scans the auditorium...          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - ACT FOUR - 2/13/03 - YELLOW     46.


  5454THE PASTOR

            Struggles to get through the crowd...


  5555BRUCE

          Finally focuses on the darkness of the catwalk... sees
          the ladder... bounds toward it...

          And we move into SLOW MOTION AS --


  5656JOHNNY

          flicks off the safety, aims...


    5757STILLSON - IN THE CROSSHAIRS

          Waiting for the applause to subside.  He smiles with great
          warmth and sincerity.


    5858JOHNNY'S FINGER

          pulls the trigger... the rifle fires...


  5959THE STAGE

          And once again to paraphrase Mr. King:

          "The slug takes away nearly one quarter of the podium,
          peeling it back to the bare, bright wood.  Splinters fly. 

          "Across the way, men in topcoats are reaching inside their
          jackets and Sonny Elliman, his green eyes blazing, is
          hollering: Down!  Greg, get DOWN! 

            "Stillson stares up to the [catwalk] and his eyes lock
          with Johnny's in a perfect sort of understanding... the
          crowd has started to move, panicky as cattle.  They all
          drive into the center aisle.  People who had been standing
          at the rear escape easily but then a bottleneck of cursing,
            screaming men and women form at the doors..."

          Finding the Pastor caught in all this.


  6060JOHNNY

          pumps another cartridge into the chamber... and is about
          to shoot when...




                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - ACT FOUR - 2/13/03 - YELLOW     47.


    60CONTINUED:60

          ANGLE - BRUCE

          Coming up the stairs, yelling 'No', at Johnny... but is
          forced to take cover as...

          Continuing Mr. King's description: "...suddenly part of
          the [catwalk] railing splinters up in front of Johnny's
          eyes.  Something screams by his ear a second later.  A
          window across the way dissolves in a tinkling rain of
          glass.

          "All three of them [motorcycle guys] across the way are
          holding handguns, their field of fire to the gallery
          crystal clear...

          "He raises the rifle to shoot again but a pistol-slug
          grooves Johnny's neck... two more bullets strike him then,
          one high in the chest, the second into the left side of
          his mid-section, spinning him around into the railing..."


  6161ECU

          -- a bloody hand ripping a red, white and blue bunting
          draped across the front of the catwalk... as he falls...
          (SAME AS SCENE 5)


  6262ECU

          -- the floor below... as feet scatter to reveal Johnny
          lying face up... chest and neck wounded and bleeding...
          crazed eyes in shock, glazing over, dying... (SAME AS
          SCENE 6)

          As he hits the ground, we RESUME NORMAL SPEED...


  6363ANGLE - THE PASTOR

          Who is only a few feet away from where Johnny fell...
          looks up shocked and confused at Bruce who is looking
          down from the catwalk... their eyes connect as Bruce starts
          to run back downstairs...


  6464MOVING WITH STILLSON

          arm around Sarah who is crying, terribly upset... reporters
            following him... has recovered his composure and is
          spinning the assassination attempt for the benefit of
          several reporters.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - ACT FOUR - 2/14/03 - GREEN      48.

                                        STILLSON
                        We can only thank God nobody else
                        was hurt.  A madman's bullet will
                        not scare us off our mission in
                        this campaign.  It will only make
                        us stronger.  Excuse us...  

            A photographer takes a photograph with Stillson and
          Sarah... and we might guess he's going to come out of
          this as a hero...


  6565OMITTED


  6666THE PASTOR KNEELS BESIDE JOHNNY

          Johnny turns to the Pastor and their eyes connect... 
          praying for Johnny --

                                        PASTOR
                        Deliver him from his sins and let
                        him partake of Thy redemption.

          Bruce arrives and pushes his way beside Johnny, during
          the prayer...  Johnny reaches out and grabs the Pastor's
          hand... and somehow Bruce knows what he has to do - he
          puts his hand on theirs - the three-way connection again -
          and looks at his father - as he does, RAMP TO THE HANDS...


6767A FLASH - THE PASTOR AND BOY BRUCE IN THE PAST (AS IN
          SCENE 1)

                                        BOY BRUCE & PASTOR
                        Come and see!


          RAMP TO THE PASTOR'S EYES...

                                        PASTOR (O.S.)
                                (overlapping)
                        Deny your destiny...


  6868THE PASTOR STANDS WITH YOUNGER BRUCE

          eleven years in the past at the door about to leave home...

                                        PASTOR
                        ...you deny God Himself.  And me.

                                        YOUNGER BRUCE
                        Nobody has a destiny.  We're all
                        just stumbling around in the dark.

    68CONTINUED:68

          And exits.  On The Pastor's reaction... RAMP TO HIS FACE...


  6969INT. ZION CHURCH - THE FUNERAL - FROZEN

          Finding the Pastor moving down the aisle... eyes narrow...
          confused... People are frozen in the line...  Johnny is
          with adult Bruce, having just embraced Johnny which was
          the first time we saw the alt reality vision... the Pastor
          looks at himself in the casket...

                                        PASTOR
                        What... dear Lord... what is...
                                (going on?)

          He looks at his frozen son... reaches out and touches the
            dreadlocks...

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        They're called dreadlocks.

          The pastor turns to see the alternate Bruce - Elder Bruce -
          walking through the frozen guests toward him... he is
          aware now that he is beyond life, that he is experiencing
            a miracle of some sort... and that plays as subtext as
          their conversation continues...

                                        PASTOR
                        You don't think I know what
                        dreadlocks are?

          Bruce smiles...

                                        PASTOR
                        I've just never seen them on my
                        son.

                                        BRUCE
                        I know.

                                        PASTOR
                                (studying the frozen
                                  Bruce)
                        I don't like them.

                                        BRUCE
                        I knew you wouldn't.

          As the Pastor turns back to the body in the casket, it
          slowly begins to make sense to him...  and this is an
            important line because as he explains it to himself, he
          is helping us understand what has happened --

                        As a man dies, he dreams of what
                        might have been. 
                                (beat, realizing)
                        My last thoughts on this earth
                        were of the day you left...

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, it's been on my mind too...
                                (re: Johnny)
                        That's what he must have tapped
                        into...

                                        PASTOR
                                (looking at Johnny)
                        Is he really an angel?

                                        BRUCE
                        I don't know.  Maybe.  This is
                        his vision we're in.

                                        PASTOR
                        Are you sure...?

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm standing at my father's funeral
                        talking to him in an alternate
                          reality.  I'm not sure of anything.

                                        PASTOR
                        Would it surprise you to know
                        that I talked to my father at his
                          funeral?  It's not so unusual. 
                        People do it all the time.

                                        BRUCE
                        What happened today, to us... it
                        was unusual.

          The Pastor considers, acknowledging...

                                        PASTOR
                        It was a blessing...

                          ...angel or not.

          The Pastor has realized at this moment that his journey...
          and all the things he's experienced in the vision of an
            alternate life... have been an opportunity - to 'deliver
          him from his sins and let him partake of Thy redemption.')
          And he softly prays over his own body... asking God for
            forgiveness.

                        see God's earth before she dies.
                        Guess she'll see it without me...

                        Sure you do.

          Bruce moves close to his father and hugs him in a bear
          hug... and as Bruce lets himself get lost in the arms of
          his father... The whole show-long vision ends the way it
          began...

                        Any of what?

                                        BRUCE
                        Because it had to be a vision. 
                        Didn't it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You had a vision?

                                        BRUCE
                        Something.  When you touched me. 
                        As I was touching him... somehow
                        the three of us...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't see a thing.  But I have
                        been having strange flashes all
                        day - that didn't make any sense -
                        of being shot... your father
                        praying over me...

          Bruce studies him... tries to make sense of it... looks
          to his father...

                                        BRUCE
                        John, there's a dead zone in all
                        of our brains, right?  We just
                        don't know how to use it.  But
                        there are times we get awful
                          close... times like this.  I told
                        you I felt like I was into my
                        dead zone today after the funeral. 
                        Your abilities - maybe they acted
                        like a lightning rod when you
                        touched me, I'm not sure.  But I
                        know how you feel now, John.  I
                        know the power of the visions.
                                (beat, as looks at
                                his father, feeling
                                very close to him)
                        My dad and I, we got a chance to
                        spend some quality time together...
                        well, it wasn't so quality for
                        you.

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        But we... we had a chance to work
                        some things through... you know?

          Johnny looks at him, sees how centered and calm Bruce
          is... he reaches up to give his shoulder a comforting
          squeeze...

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't you touch me.

          It plays funny but Johnny reacts, pulls back.

                                        BRUCE
                        I like it here.  And you need me
                        here.

          Johnny doesn't understand exactly what that means but
          smiles curiously.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You won't get an argument from
                        me.

          He leaves Bruce alone with his father... as Bruce looks
          to his dad...


  7171INT. BATHROOM MIRROR - DAY

          Bruce studies himself in the mirror... his hand raises a
          pair of scissors... and as he begins to snip off his
            dreadlocks...


  7272*EXT.  THE CHURCH NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

          Johnny is throwing his overnight bag into the trunk of*
          his rental car when he looks up and reacts as he sees*
          Bruce approaching, carrying his bag, clean shaven (should*
          match the last shot of him cutting his hair) and dreadlocks*
          gone.  Bruce feels Johnny's stare as he throws his bag in*
          the trunk.*

                                        BRUCE*
                                (re: the look)*
                        What?*

                                        JOHNNY*
                          Nothing.*

          He slams the trunk, can't help hanging on to the curious*




                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - ACT FOUR - 3/28/03 - YEL-2      53.

          look.  Moving to the doors.*

                                        BRUCE*
                                (answering the unspoken*
                                  question)*
                        Spring is coming.  It's already*
                          starting to get warmer.  My ears*
                        need air.*

                                        JOHNNY*
                        Well, they've got plenty now. *
                        You did that yourself, did you?*

                                        BRUCE*
                        Why, what's wrong with it?*

                                        JOHNNY*
                        It's just that left ear seems a*
                        little higher than the right.*

          They're in the car...*

                                        BRUCE*
                        Let's go home, John.  You and me --*
                        we have work to do.  [or]  You*
                        and me -- we have a world to save. *
                        Come and see.*

          Bruce and Johnny ride into the sunset and we...*

                                                                              FADE OUT:
