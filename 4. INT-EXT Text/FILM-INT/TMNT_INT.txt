Okay - waita-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA!!
Suddenly TEN KIDS WITH BIRTHDAY HATS AND FOAM NUNCHUCKS run

SCREAMING KIDS
Get him! Yeah! You suck! Hey!
Awright! Take that, Turtle-dork!
MICHAELANGELO

toddler street gang. One of the kids does a finger-point-then-
throat-slit gesture. The mom looks and beams. The kids
quickly smile to cover.

Mikey looks to the side, and sees the still piled-high stack

But this isn't just any half-pipe - it tests all of Mikey's
skills in ninjitsu, extreme sports and cross-training. He
jumps on and off the board to occasionally tackle obstacles
with all four limbs. A fun rock n' roll sequence.
Feels like Mikey is miles away from the surface world when he
arrives at a seemingly DEAD END. He smiles as he reveals a

the place is custom lit to provide the right kind of

a mesh of wires and circuitry powering the entire lair.
Donatello runs up to Mikey. Mikey robotically hands him the
wad of money from the party.
DONATELLO

As Donnie walks away, Mikey LOUDLY CLEARS HIS THROAT. Don
stops as Mikey holds out his hand. Don's busted - he peels
off a few bills and hands Mikey his share.
MICHAELANGELO

Mikey walks into the room and plops down on a sofa. Hits a
remote as a BIG SCREEN lights up in front of him. Suddenly-
SPLINTER (O.S.)
MICHAELANGELO!
Mikey springs from the couch. Snaps to obedience.
MICHAELANGELO
Yes, sensei.
ANGLE ON - SPLINTER the Japanese rodent master and father of
the TMNT. He is well-kempt, still walks with a cane, and has
the same sparkle in his eye. He approaches Mikey. Silent.
SPLINTER

Oh! Here ya go, Master Splinter.
Mikey reaches into his bag and removes a foil-wrapped piece
of BIRTHDAY CAKE. Splinter lights up.
SPLINTER
Ahh! Butter creme frosting!
Donatello walks to Splinter. Holds his hand out, judgmental.
DONATELLO
Master. No cake. You remember your
last cholesterol tests.
SPLINTER
But I-

-Donatello! I am your Master!
DONATELLO
Nice try, sensei. But you can still
be my Master... with low
cholesterol.
Splinter surrenders the cake. As Don walks away,
Michaelangelo reaches into his bag and secretly passes
Splinter a smaller wrapped piece.
SPLINTER
He-heh. You have done well, my son.

dozens of other pieces of Birthday Cake leftovers. He tosses

only one foot until the door is pushed up against piles of
TECH JUNK. Mikey uses his shoulder and pushes it open.

Tinkering as always. Wild inventions line the walls, some

ELECTRONICA MUSIC blares out.

Oh, hi Mikey. You say something?
MICHAELANGELO

Every day it's the same thing. Wake

DONATELLO

A beat. Mikey sighs, then walks back downstairs to the LIVING

knows it, Splinter is sitting next to him, cross legged,
still, and sipping tea.
MICHAELANGELO
WAH!!
SPLINTER
Michaelangelo. Boredom is never an
indicator of your surroundings. It
is a reflection of your inner
heart. Fill yourself with
excitement on the inside... and
you'll live the most rewarding life
of all.
Mikey stares at Splinter, dead pan. A beat. Then returns to
flipping channels. He stops on a NEWS program - "NYC DIRT".
NYC DIRT REPORTER (O.S.)
And so yet again, police officials
are baffled at a crime of
retribution that can only be
attributed to the mysterious figure

known as "The Nightwatcher".
ikey lights up. On TV is a flashy well-coifed, know-nothing
REPORTER. Beside him is a news photo of the tied up MUGGER

NYC DIRT REPORTER(cont'd)
Although the victims have been
criminals themselves, the
Nightwatcher's actions have been
identified as destructive and
overly-violent... verging on the
edge of lethal.
ON MIKEY - Can't smile wide enough. He runs to his room,
returns with a POLAROID CAMERA. He snaps a picture of the TV.
He pulls it out, placing it in his NIGHTWATCHER SCRAPBOOK,
overflowing with paper clippings and articles on the
vigilante.
MICHAELANGELO
Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!
Cruising the streets, busting those
who hold themselves above the law.
(movie announcer voice)
But they aren't above HIS.
Don walks in, holding an in-process invention. He looks up.
DONATELLO
Mikey, the man's practically a
criminal himself. Anyone who
operates without boundary or rule
of law cannot be legislated and
needs to be reigned in.
RAPHAEL (O.S.)
Sounds like four turtles I used ta
know.
ON DOOR - Raphael walks in, his Nightwatcher costume no where
in sight.
RAPHAEL
Whatta we talkin' about, boys?
Soundin' a little too egghead fer
my tastes.
PLINTER
Ah, Raphael. Your brothers and I
were just discussing the vigilante
Nightwatcher once again.
(beat - concerned)
Where have you been? You've been
spending so much time away from
home lately...
Raphael's on edge from the mention of Nightwatcher already.
His attention doesn't break from Donatello.

So just what's your beef with
puttin' dirtbags behind bars,
Donnie? Go ahead... enlighten me.

Splinter watches the growing tension with concern.
DONATELLO
I have no problem with the
incarceration of those who deserve
it, but if someone like
Nightwatcher has ultimate power...
then who makes sure he doesn't
cross the line?
Mikey picks up two NINJA BLADE RINGS, twirling them around
aggressively in mock battle.
MICHAELANGELO
I think he's COOL.
DONATELLO
Of course you would.
MICHAELANGELO
(in bg, oblivious)
Keeya! HATCHAAAAAA!!
RAPHAEL
Sometimes there are lines that even
the police can't cross. Someone has
to be willing to do what needs to
be done. And to do that, fear
becomes a weapon.
DONATELLO
You are such a Neanderthal.
Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don. Don reacts quick
and startled, eyes wide.
APHAEL
I rest my case.

PLINTER
(SCOLDING)
Raphael! If bullying is the only
way to argue your point, then
perhaps you do not have much of a
point to begin with.
APHAEL

Yes, sensei.

And quit touchin' my stuff.
Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms
out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the
second floor.

DONATELLO
(too-late-retort to Raph)
That was just a startle response
and isn't really an indication of
fear!
Raph does the "blah blah" hand gesture from above. Enters his
room, slams the door and immediately BLASTS MUSIC...
...and it's some annoying pop HIP-HOP song.
RAPHAEL (O.S.)
AAAARGH! AND STOP TOUCHING MY
STEREO TOO, MIKEY!!!
Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing to drown out his family. A
silence sits in the room as a CD flies out of Raph's room.
Tense in the room for a bit. Don looks at the other two.

It's an involuntary thing your body
does when stimulated like that.

A DEEP VOICE chants OS in a South American tongue as HIGH-
TECH GEAR is placed on the rock. It becomes powered,
triggering a reaction in the stone itself.
Music builds as we see quick shots of the granite cracks
GLOWING RED. Camera travels with the rising glow.
End on a pair of DEAD EYES - suddenly come to life. Red glow.

UP ANGLE on the Tower. Dead of night. No one around.

A cavernous structure. Dimly lit. High ceiling. A few odd
silhouettes here and there.
We hear the clicking of Winters' shoes echo as he enters.
WINTERS
What seems to be the problem?
Karai and six Ninja are already there.
KARAI
The "problem" is that we were hired
to merely patrol the city and
report anything "strange" to you.

42.
KARAI(cont'd)
(grabs sword hilt)
You never said anything about
MONSTERS.
Winters smirks, looking at the mouse who thinks he can take
the lion. He reaches to a satchel on the floor. The Foot
TENSE in anticipation. Instead... Winters comes up with a
MONEY BRICK.
INTERS
(tosses money brick)
So, your job duties were just
redefined. Congratulations on your
promotion.
SHINK! - Karai pulls out her To and slices the brick in mid-
air. Winters STOPS and looks back over his shoulder.
KARAI
We may be hired help to you, but
you should never forget... we are
the Foot Clan.
ON WINTERS - Condescendingly finds this particularly `cute'.
WINTERS
Oooooooh...
It sets the Foot off. They all grab their weapons, moving
toward Winters. Karai flips forward, sword drawn and at
Winters throat!
...as Winters stands still... and begins to LAUGH.
Slowly, the thumping of FOUR SETS OF FEET lumber out of the
shadows. Reveal themselves to be THE FOUR STONE GENERALS.
They flank Winters, who is just loving the theatricality of
it all.
The Foot Ninja leap back. Winters remains confident and
unmoving. Generals SMIRK at Karai and the Foot.
WINTERS
I believe we made a deal, Karai. I
expect you to honor it.
(beat, stares her down)
You do understand "honor", don't
you?
Karai stews... unblinking stare. Of course she does.
WINTERS
So I don't care what part of
"muscle for hire" you don't
understand. I hired your muscle.
Now exercise the ones attached to
your feet and...
(closer - terse)
...get back to work.
43.
Karai slowly steps back. Winters smiles wide, reaches into
the drawer and takes another brick of bills and tosses it to
W
a Foot Ninja. Then another to a second Ninja.
INTERS
So I will double... no, no...
TRIPLE your pay for your troubles.
(stare down)
Are we cool?
ON FOOT - They just stare back, blank goggles. Probably
seething inside. Winters is flanked by Generals.
WINTERS
Are we... cool?
The Foot don't move. Tense. Karai finally nods. Terse.
WINTERS
Ninjas. No sense of humor.
(to Generals)
So how did we fare?
CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is
wheeled into the light.
Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit
pallet on the floor. We can barely make it out as being the
HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight.
WINTERS
(close, quiet)
So it begins...
It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily.
Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw.
Creature suddenly lunges forward! Winters doesn't flinch. He
merely grins at the creature.
WINTERS
(to General Aguila)
Were there any problems?
AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over
Winters by a foot. Clearly the leader of the four.
GENERAL AGUILA
None, my lord.
WINTERS
(to Karai)
You see, now THAT'S a good soldier.
You two should compare notes.
Karai and Aguila stare at each other. Karai obviously not
used to being handled like this.
K
44.
KARAI
Just what is this all about?
WINTERS
Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt.
(re: Generals)
I now have the power and know-how,
but I need the speed and stealth of
an organization such as your own.
Not to mention an organization that
values discretion.
KARAI
But of course.
WINTERS
You see, I have nine more beasts
like this that should be coming to
town very soon. Thirteen in all, to
be exact.
The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the
floor ahead - into a DISK on the floor. ON CEILING - We see
the top of a CAGE inserted over top, creating a cell.
ARAI
But... why? Why here? Why now?
WINTERS
Instinct, mostly. They're animals
at their core.
(looks off, distant)
And they recognize something
familiar in the air... in the
stars.
(BEAT)
What can I say? I'm a lover of
animals.
The disk ROTATES. WIDER we see that there are already some
cells inserted on the large stone disk in the floor. Filled
by darkened silhouettes of creatures that we're probably glad
W
we don't fully see. Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness.
INTERS
So you go and get to know each
other. And don't forget... play
nice.
The Generals turn and walk-push the Foot out of the door.
They move to fight back, but Karai waves her hand.
KARAI
Not now. Our business will be
handled at a later time...

After they leave, we pause for A BEAT on Winters. Quiet.
Tired. Contemplative.

Three brothers sit around their breakfast table, looking hung
over from the previous night's brawl. Mikey comes in, looking
the worst of all, and plops into his seat. Cam circles table.
MICHAELANGELO
Dudes, did anyone get the license
plate of the thing that hit us last
night? Oi, my head...
Don pours over a thick book on MONSTERS AND MYTHOLOGY.
DONATELLO
Was it just me, or did that
creature look familiar?
RAPHAEL
We coulda taken it if you slackers
woulda pitched in sooner.
LEONARDO
Fact remains, Raph, that we should
have never been there in the first
place.
APHAEL
Well, I suppose that we shoulda let
Mr. Cuddly-kins continue to spread
happiness throughout the city... oh
wait... HE WAS A FREAKING MONSTER
TRYIN' TA KILL US!!! Good call,
fearless leader.
ONATELLO
Come to think of it, it WAS pretty
strange to see the Foot too. And
who was that woman?
MICHAELANGELO
I dunno, but she sure gave Leo a
run for his money.
LEONARDO
(still fighting with Raph)
This is my fault now, Raph? I'm the
only one who has to be responsible!
RAPHAEL
Hey, you're the "trained master",
not me.

MICHAELANGELO
(quickly interjected)
Dudes-can-it-here-comes-Splinter.
ON DOOR - Splinter walks in, HUMMING to himself.
SPLINTER
Good morning, my sons.
TURTLES
Morning, sensei.
Splinter makes himself a TEA. Room is SILENT.
ON TURTLES - Raph and Leo GLARE at one another while they
eat. Don is pouring over a THICK BOOK while Mikey sits with
his forehead on the table.
SPLINTER
If anyone needs me, I'll be
watching my stories.
S
plinter walks out. OS sound of the TV being turned on. At
the table, the glare continues.
LEONARDO
Hothead.
RAPHAEL
Splinter-junior.
NYC DIRT REPORTER (O.S.)
And in the latest of a string of
strange criminal activity, a
construction site was nearly
destroyed last night. Authorities
believe a violent battle had taken
place earlier that evening.
The boys react and rush into the MAIN LIVING AREA.
ON TV - a well-coifed News Reporter stands outside of the I-
BEAM TOWER. In the daylight, we can see the building is
twisted and dented from the night's fighting.
The boys immediately JUMP FORWARD. Mikey grabs the remote and
ups the volume.
SPLINTER
My sons, what-
Splinter's eyes go wide. He looks at his boys listening to
the TV intently. Mikey nurses his sore head.
SPLINTER
I believe you boys have some
explaining to do...

Splinter looks at the Turtles. Busted, as we-

The Turtles are kneeling before their sensei.
SPLINTER
Leonardo, I am most disappointed in
you. You are the leader of your
brothers. I was counting on you to
bring order to the chaos of this
family.
LEONARDO
But Master Splinter, how can I be
expected to do so when Ra-
SPLINTER
There are no excuses when you are
the Leader, my student.
ON LEO - Biting his tongue. Hard.
SPLINTER
But the involvement of the Foot and
their mysterious leader worries me.
ICHAELANGELO
I'm personally worried about a
monster running around the streets
of New York. But hey, that's just
me.
Don elbows Mikey back in line.
RAPHAEL
We hafta go out and find who's
responsible for this. There ain't
no other solution.
SPLINTER
Raphael, there are better ways to
use your skills in ninjitsu. Fact-
gathering. Analysis. Observation.
Direct contact should only be your
last resort.
RAPHAEL
Wow, sounds... exciting.
LEONARDO
Save the brute vigilante junk for
that Nightwing guy.

MIKEY/RAPH
"Nightwatcher".

Raph stands and exits the room. The others stay silent as we-

QUICK SHOTS - Nightwatcher gearing up.
ightwatcher emerges from a MAN HOLE. Walks to a long-
forgotten and shadowed underside of a BRIDGE. He points up
with a REMOTE - chirp! Slowly, his MOTORBIKE begins to lower
on retractable grappling hooks.

April is dressed in work-out gear on a grouping of floor
mats. She twirls a wooden KATANA as part of a floor routine.
Wow - she's actually pretty good! Casey eats a bag of chips
with one hand, does curls with a dumbbell with the other.
CASEY
Nah. Ever since you started with
the blade weapons you, um... you
kinda scare me.
APRIL
Suit yourself.
(she stops - a beat)
Case?
CASEY
Yeah?
APRIL
(AWKWARD)
Are you happy? I mean, with your
life. With me.
Casey pauses a beat. Tries to be upbeat.
CASEY
Yeah. Sure.
(beat - serious)
You?
April thinks just as much.
APRIL
Yeah.
They sit on that for a moment. Casey leans in for a kiss.
April doesn't notice. Awkward. Casey changes his mind.
CASEY

APRIL
Casey, I think we need to talk.

I don't want- whoa.
OFF HER LOOK - Casey is standing there, bracing the near-
unconscious Raph, now without his Nightwatcher garb.
CASEY
Could use a little... help here...

Hey April... how ya been?

ICHAELANGELO
Whoa... I am in the wrong line of
work. Nice pad, kids.
Don immediately starts checking Raph out.

His vital signs seem to be okay.

Pupil dilation is normal.
Raph weakly pushes Donnie's head away.

DONATELLO
Temper is normal too.

He's going to be fine. Health-wise,

same old Raph.
(BEAT)
Whoa.
ON RAPH'S SHELL - Two Obsidian Disks are wedged in his back
with a Tranquilizer Dart. Donnie wedges out the Obsidian Disk
with pliers.
LOSE ON - Disk. It's beautiful and deadly. Don examines.
DONATELLO
Some sort of stone... probably
obsidian, I think.
(CLOSER)
There's an engraving on it.
Looks... South American. Aztec? No.
It's definitely not Mayan.
April swallows hard.
APRIL
It can't be.
DONATELLO
What can't be, April?
April sits down on the floor with the disk. Trying to figure
things out. Casey leans down to her.
CASEY
Would it help things if I said that
we were being chased by a one of
those statues you collected for
that Winters guy?
ON APRIL - Her mouth is agape.
MICHAELANGELO
I'd say that's a big ten-four.
APRIL
(MUTTERING)
It's just a myth... a legend.
(CLOSER)
It can't be.

CASEY
And I suppose that bringing up the
thirty-foot flying monster would
probably just push this over the
edge, huh?
ON APRIL - She slowly turns to Casey. Floored.
LEONARDO
What are you talking about Casey?
CASEY
Just some story this Winters guy
told us. It all started down in
South America. Long before the
Ashmecks and the Macaroons.
APRIL
Azteks and Mayans.
CASEY
That's what i said.
APRIL
Sit down, Jones.
(to group)
So there was this guy call Yaotl...
CAM PANS TO THE RIGHT - As it passes a FG element, the screen
dips to black. We hear sounds of a violent BATTLE. Monsters
shrieking. Blades clashing. April's retelling Winters' story.
DIP TO BLACK:
Everyone is gathered around as April finishes. Mikey, in
particular, is hunched over, intent. Casey, like before, has
fallen asleep. Silence for a beat. Then-
MICHAELANGELO
Well?! WHAT NEXT?!!!
APRIL
No one knows. The legend stops
there.
THINKS)
But it's just a legend.
Donnie studies the tranq dart under a magnifying glass of
April's.
DONATELLO
The micro-tech of this dart is
astounding. The molybdenum is of a
grade only found in a few select
markets... not to mention it's
current stock is going for a little
more than two-grand an ounce right
now.

DONATELLO(cont'd)

EONARDO
So what do we have? We have someone
with a lot of money.
ONATELLO
Access to technology... and the
means to produce it to exact specs.
RAPHAEL
Not to mention having a keen
interest in these monsters... and
them four stone jokers.
DONATELLO
If you ask me, it all somehow
points to Winters Corp.
LEONARDO
How do you figure that, Donnie?
Donatello looks up with MAGNIFYING GOGGLES on. Sarcastic.
DONATELLO
Hello? "Genius"?
(a beat)
Well, that, and the fact that this
part has a Winters Corporation logo
on it.
EONARDO
Do you think he's trying to
recreate the events from back then?
RAPHAEL
Well, what would you do with an
army of monsters?
MICHAELANGELO
Well, aside from having your own
wrestling league, I dunno... MAYBE
TAKE OVER THE WORLD?
LEONARDO
Do bad guys still try to do that?
DONATELLO
Yes, however they're usually
mortgage re-fi companies.
(THEN)
What about it, April? You just
finished working with the guy,
right? Does it make sense?
APRIL
Guys! It's a legend!
R
62.
MICHAELANGELO
Is that "legend" like the ginormous
freakin' hairball that attacked us?
APHAEL
Or "legend" like the moving statues
and flying creature that attacked
me n' Casey?
APRIL
Okay. Fine. I'll help for now...
until we prove you're all insane.
LEONARDO
Or until we prove Winters is up to
something more than collecting art.
DONATELLO
I'll work with April and see if
these Stars of Kikin she told us
about can give us any clues.
RAPHAEL
I say we just storm the castle and
face this jerk in person!
LEONARDO
Raph, that would be the worst idea
yet. We hang back. Analyze.
Formulate a plan, THEN storm your
castle. Are we clear?
Tense stare off between Raph and Leo. Raph moves anyway.
Casey stops him. Quieter moment.
CASEY
Raph. Don't do it, man.
(BEAT)
I spent my whole life running out
of rooms ticked off at the world. I
wish I could take most of `em back.
Sometimes, just takin' a breather
is the best thing to do.
ON APRIL - She's listening to Casey... maybe her man-boy is
growing up. Raph knows he can't win.
RAPHAEL
Yeah... whatever.

BACK PACK... He pulls it open, revealing his Night gear.

Donnie looks through a thick book on ASTRONOMY.
PRIL (O.S.)
Think this is all of them, Donnie.
ON DOOR - April walks in, holding a 3-foot-high stack of
yellowed documents.
APRIL
I cleaned out my archives on
ancient South America. Might have
found something useful.
She takes out a hand-drawn map.
APRIL
A map of the stars, as recorded by
an Aztec Shaman. They pinpoint the
location of the Stars of Kikin...
even though the names changed.
DONATELLO
For use in an Aztec calendar.
(picks up map)
So, if we can cross-reference our
current star field, positioning of
the Stars of Kikin and backtrack
positioning based off of the Aztec
CALENDAR-
APRIL
-along with taking into account the
point of origin of the first
occurrence, we should know where
another portal could take place.
(to herself)
Max, what are you up to?

Leo paces back and forth in the main area. Splinter walks in.
Mikey plays video games on the main TV.
SPLINTER
Leonardo, time cannot be moved
faster by wearing a groove in our
floor.
MICHAELANGELO
Seriously, dude. We're all
stressed. Try to chill.
LEONARDO
You're playing video games on the
possible eve of Armageddon, Mikey.
MICHAELANGELO
(INSULTED)
But I never said I was having fun.
Leo looks at the clock.
LEONARDO
Where's Raph?
SPLINTER
Leonardo, a true leader knows the
virtue of patience... and when to
stop exercising it.
DONATELLO
We're almost done, Leo. You might
want to go get him... If you can
find him, that is.
Leo looks at Splinter, clearly feeling leadership pressure
and Raph's absence makes it worse. He leaves the lair.

It's dark. Barely lit in the hallways of the top private
floors of Winters Tower.

ictures spanning centuries in age. Some photos. Some
portraits. Families. Loved ones.

Cam continues until we find a high-backed chair parked in
front of an oversized blazing FIREPLACE.
ON CHAIR - Winters sits. Tired. Sullen. Sipping brandy. Looks
above the fireplace and lifts his snifter in a toast.
INTERS
To picking up the pieces.
66.
ABOVE FIREPLACE - is a suit of armor... THE suit of armor of
none other than Yaotl the Conqueror. He looks at it with
heavy thought. Then-
WINTERS
What is it?
Winters doesn't turn around. Stays in E-FG. Cam adjusts to
show the shape of GENERAL AGUILA in the doorway.
GENERAL AGUILA
Two creatures remain, my lord.
A long beat. Winters closes his eyes.

Well, by all means then. Let's

A greasy DINER COOK finishes cleaning up the tables. He
suddenly hears a noise in the back. Big CLANK.
KITCHEN - He walks to the back. He hears the noise... now
from inside the WALK-IN FREEZER. He slowly approaches it.
ANOTHER NOISE. He moves to open
INSIDE OF FREEZER - the door slowly opens. The man's face
peers in. His eyes go WIDE. He SCREAMS!!!
-KERSMASH! He goes through the front window! He stands, cat-
like. Ready for anything. The room is only lit by the neon
signage behind the counter. Suddenly -
Night creeps to the freezer. He can hear the CHEWING and the
SNARLING behind the thick door. He takes out a spiked brass-
knuckle. Ready. Places a hand on the door... and opens it.
ON DOORWAY - The creature is huddled over a pile of frozen
meat. Chewing with pieces flying everywhere. Disgusting. It
turns around - monkey-like and ferocious looking DEMON... but
"cute" in a bizarre kinda way. Music builds as go-
WIDER ON SIDE VIEW - Night stands there. The horrible demon
creature suddenly jumps out of the freezer too! Face off with
Raph as we realize-
-it's only THREE FEET TALL!
NIGHTWATCHER
Hey there little fella. All that
commotion for just little ole y-
The Demon SCREAMS! It jumps Night, slamming him to the floor
behind a row of tables!
NIGHTWATCHER (O.S.)
WAHH! OOOF! AAAGGH! OW!! WHOAAA!!!
Plates, glasses and utensils fly everywhere, smashing all
over the diner as the Demon pummels him.
CLOSE ON NIGHT - The Demon is jumping up and down, slamming
his helmeted head repeatedly to the floor! It lunges forward,
mouth open as Night backhands it with a PLATE. The Demon
jumps back and up, landing on a rotating CEILING FAN.
T
he creature lunges down again, but this time, Night is
ready. He fights back. Like fighting with a Chihuahua hopped
up on cocaine.
A break in the fight. The creature has disappeared. Night
knows he's there. He preps. Grabs his SMOKE PELLETS from his
pocket. And waits... until...
...the Demon swoops in for another attack! Mouth open, fangs
bared as Night tosses the smoke pellets inside!
WIDE - POOOMPH! POOOMPH! POOOMPH! The pellets explode in its
mouth, sending smoke shooting out of it's nostrils, ears and
eyes! It shrieks, flying out of the Diner!

NIGHTWATCHER
(victory taunting)
Yeah! That's what I thought! Don't
mess with the Nightwatcher!
Night turns. His helmet is still on. He hits his LIGHTS on
the side of his head to see through the thick smoke. He finds
the DINER COOK huddled behind the counter. Night looks scary.
DINER COOK
Pl-pl-please don't hurt me!
NIGHTWATCHER
Whattaya talkin' about? I JUST
SAVED YOU!
DINER COOK
Please, sir. I have kids.
Night looks around. He sees the CASH REGISTER on the floor.
He picks it up, puts it on the counter.
NIGHTWATCHER
There ya go, pal. Make sure this is
safe. HEY - YOU HEARIN' ME?
DINER COOK
TAKE IT! JUST TAKE IT! DON'T HURT
ME, PLEASE!
NIGHTWATCHER
LISTEN! I DON'T WANT YER FRIGGIN'
CASH! WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE SUCH A
HARD TIME BELIEVIN' I'M A GOOD GUY?

I JUST SAVED YOUR STINKIN' LIFE!
Sudddenly - SHINK! - a THROWING STAR is lodged in the cash
register till! Night jumps. Looks out the window.
CAM PULLS WAY WAY BACK, REALLY FAST - Out the Diner and to
the rooftop across the street... and over the green shoulders
of LEO.
ll he sees is a panicked man and the large shape of
Nightwatcher standing over him, holding the register.
CLOSE ON LEO - He's fuming. Staring down at Nightwatcher. The
frustration of the last few days pent up inside of him.
B
ACK IN DINER - Night slowly lays down the register. Trying
to figure out his next move.

Clenches both tight.
SPLINTER
Raphael? What is the matter?
RAPHAEL
(RANTING)
I was out, and did... something...
something happened and I- ARRRGH!!!
Raphael picks up a HEAVY WEIGHT and hurls is across the dojo.
Splinter is unfazed, but he won't take any more.
SPLINTER
Raphael! Kneel.
Raph stops. Breathing heavy. Falls in line - walking to
Splinter and dropping to his knees in front of his father.
RAPHAEL
I did something... I did something
really stupid, Master Splinter.
SPLINTER
Go on...
RAPHAEL
(SEMI-RAMBLING)
I know why you chose him now. I
know that there's a reason why he's
the better son and I'm not.
(THINKS)
And I think I made things worse
tonight.
(beat - calming down)
A WHOLE lot worse... I know you
must be ashamed of me, father.
Raphael is lost in his guilt. Splinter kneels in front of
Raph.
SPLINTER
Raphael. You always bear the
world's problems on your shoulders.
It is an admirable quality when you
are a protector of others...
plinter gently lays a hand on Raph's shoulder.

SPLINTER
But you must realize that while, at
times, you may not be my favorite
student, it does not mean that you
are my least favorite son.
Raphael looks up. Having not thought of it that way.
SPLINTER
You are strong, passionate and
loyal to a fault. These are the
merits of a great leader as well...
but only when tempered with
compassion and humility.
RAPHAEL
But Master Splinter, I messed up
big tonight... I mean BIG.
Splinter chews on this.
SPLINTER
Leonardo? R
APHAEL
(beat, ashamed)
Yes.
Splinter is grim. Nods. But he moves on.
SPLINTER
Well then, I believe your brothers
may be in need of a leader.
Raphael looks up. Finally, his shot. He holds his SAIS in one
hand, and his BOLO CHAIN in the other. Ninja Turtle vs.
Nightwatcher. He grips them both hard. He drops the chain.
RAPHAEL
Thank you... father.
Mikey bursts in the door, frantic.

DONATELLO
So, the first time that this portal
was opened, the Stars of Kikin
aligned...
(sketches on high tech

...and that's why it occurred in
that specific South American
region.

Now if we take into account the
continual rotation of the Earth
since then, as well as the gradual
celestial shift that's happened and
been recorded over... well, over
the course of that mountain of

new location.
Donnie's drawn a NEW LINE from the alignment of the stars.
April elbows Casey to wake him up.

DONATELLO
New York City.
APRIL
Winters Tower.
DONATELLO
And the alignment is due to occur
in precisely-
(checks watch)
- well... tonight.
It sits in the room. Heavy.
MICHAELANGELO
But without Leo... what do we do?
No one answers. Splinter looks to Raph. Raph steps up.
RAPHAEL
We rescue our brother... and save
New York City.
Splinter stands to his side.
SPLINTER
Together.

DARK STORM CLOUDS gather over Winters Tower. A horrible
electrical storm is brewing.

87
The lobby has changed. Shots establishing the jury-rigged
nature of Winters Tower.
- The large Aztec-like calendar on the lobby floor suddenly
SPLITS and slides open, creating a 100 foot circle in the
middle. Underneath is the TOWERS CELL BASEMENT.
-
The
disk in the basement is suddenly RAISED up to the lobby
area,
replacing the slick marble design with an antiquated
stone
version. Only now, THIRTEEN CREATURE CELLS surround the
disk.
Very ceremonial.
- Finally, Winters' office elevator LOWERS from high above.
He's in the actual ceremonial gear worn by Yaotl years ago.
He holds the helmet to his side. Very serious. He looks over
his now-ceremonial lobby... satisfied.
PUSH IN on one cell, as Leo sits hunched over, unconscious
and helpless...
SMASH CUT TO:

Quick shots of April and Casey gearing up. Casey with his off-
the-shelf sporting gear. April with sleek-looking Japanese
combat gear and weaponry.
They both emerge from their rooms, dressed to kill. Casey's
jaw drops as we scope out April.
CASEY
Wow.
APRIL
(models it)
Picked it up on my last trip to
Japan. You... like it?
CASEY
Oh... oh yeah.
They share the moment. Seeing what they forgot about each
other when they first met. It's enough for them to smile.
APRIL
Where's your mask?
M
E
77.
CASEY
(faking confusion)
Mask? What mask?
April runs into the other room and comes back with her hands
behind her back. She takes out a NEW MASK for Casey - cool,
crisp and a badass paintjob.
CASEY
No way...
APRIL
I was saving it for our
anniversary.
CASEY
(BEAT)
Thanks.
Almost awkward as Casey leans forward and is about to kiss
her... Then a MUSICAL TUNE (first bar of the TMNT series)
plays on a car horn outside, interrupting them again.
APRIL
That's our ride.
89
89
CAM PULLS BACK from the back seat. Everyone is in "the zone".
Splinter and Don sit in the back seat. Pulling further toward
the front, we see April and Casey.
nd on Raph in passenger seat and Mikey driving.
RAPHAEL
You know I ain't much on speeches.
(BEAT)
But we can do this. Leo, or no Leo.
(looks around)
Not because of our individual
strengths... but because of how we
function as a team.
ICHAELANGELO
I love you man.
RAPHAEL
Don't push it.
(to April)
April, this is going to be
dangerous. You sure you're in?
APRIL
I feel responsible, fellas. I found
the Generals for him.
O

CAM CONTINUES TO PULL OUT - as the familiar jingle of
Cowabunga Carl fades in and we see the Cowabunga Carl Party
R
Van in full view.
APHAEL (O.S.)
Nice an' incognito there, Mikey.
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
Well, I didn't see you offering any
suggestions... besides-
(imitates Splinter)
- a true ninja can hide in plain
sight, my son!
SPLINTER (O.S.)
I heard that!
Van takes off as the CAMERA SLOWS in the street, watching it
drive away. NYC civilians point to the sky, worried. PUSH IN
on a TV/STEREO STORE WINDOW - Simon's Electronics.
ON TV - Broadcasting a news report. Weather alert. Black
clouds brew over head.
BUBBLY WEATHER REPORTER (O.C.)
Scientists are calling it the
fiercest storm of the new
millennium, with Dopler Radar
readings coming in off the charts.
Authorities are imposing a curfew
to avoid possible civilian harm.
Stay tuned for more in minutes.
FURTHER DOWN THE STREET - We see Winters Tower and the
darkest clouds of all beginning to collect overhead.
90

Winters stands with Four Generals in his office, overseeing
the portal. Ready.
91
91
Karai walks down the center path of the garden, flanked by a
DOZEN FOOT NINJA. She motions for them to take position.
KARAI
As ordered - no one gets in. No one
interferes. No one bears witness.
SUDDENLY - the security alarm from the front gate BUZZES.
Karai waits a beat. It buzzes again. She walks to the
SECURITY PANEL by the front gate.
N MONITOR - We see CASEY standing there, obscured by a LARGE
WOODEN CRATE IN FRONT OF HIM. Karai coldly opens the gate.
C
79.
KARAI
May I help you?
CASEY
Yeah, hey, I was supposed
to drop
this off for Mr. Winters.
If I
don't get this done, I am
majorly
in the doghouse. You know
what I'm
sayin', right? Right?
The two stare at each other as the CAM ANGLES BEHIND KARAI -
she's holding a KATANA SWORD behind her back!
AM DOLLIES OVERHEAD as we see that Casey is packing MAJOR
sports gear "heat" on his end too. Both don't let on.
KARAI
Please come in, then.
CASEY
Really!?
(beat - gets composed)
I mean, "but of course".
Casey wheels the crate inside. The gate closes only KARAI HAS
NOW DISAPPEARED! Casey opens the front hatch, revealing Don,
Raph, Mikey, April and Splinter.
R
APHAEL
Let's NEVER do this again.
(waves hand in front of
nose, glares at MIkey)
And who did that?!
MICHAELANGELO
What?! Why does everyone always
call ME out?
A long beat. Then...
SPLINTER
I apologize my sons.
Everyone looks at sheepish Splinter. A beat. Suddenly-
WIDER - The empty garden begins to move. CREEPY, as DOZENS OF
FOOT NINJA begin to rise out of the shadows and slink toward
our heroes, surrounding them.
KARAI makes a dramatic entrance, landing in front of April
and Casey. Tense beat.
CASEY
I suppose this is where we all take
out our sharp and pointy things?
KARAI
You suppose correctly.
W
80.
ON HEROES - As they all draw their weapons. HIGH ANGLE as the
Foot all draw theirs. Stand-off. Raph twirls his sais.
RAPHAEL
I am SO gonna enjoy this...
92
92
Winters walks along all the cells - a final check. He
examines one of the cells.
PUSH IN - it's LEO. He's slowly waking up - groggy. Muttering
incoherently. He PASSES OUT AGAIN.
93
93
We finally get to see how much of an ass-kicker Master
Splinter is. Same with April, who squares off against Karai.
They fight hard. April ends up cornered, about to be skewered
by her blade when...
-CLUNK! She wobbles and then passes out. When Karai falls out
of frame, she reveals CASEY JONES a hundred yards behind her
holding his HOCKEY STICK! April frowns.
APRIL
I had the situation under control.
CASEY
(SMIRKS)
You're welcome.
Mikey fights the most like Jackie Chan - comical maneuvers
backed by solid-hitting blows. Don uses his bo-staff in 1001
different ways, both offensively and defensively.
Casey is enjoying the hell out of it. High flying, adrenaline
rush. He even catches April checking him out, and vice versa.
April suddenly spots an opening to the front doors!
APRIL
Guys! Front door is open. Now!
They all charge the front door!
94

Winters is happy. He looks up to the heavens. Checks a time
piece. Winters begins chanting ANCIENT MAGICK/SPELLS. Looks
up through the opening in the middle of the building.
INTERS
(THEN)
YESSSSSSS!!!!
81.
The cam PULLS UP through the building. Up over NYC. Through
the clouds... and into space until we pass all ALIGNED STARS.
S
PACE - The final star drifts into position. A LIGHT BURST
EFFECT travels down each star, headed to Earth.
BACK IN LOBBY - The light burst flies into the lobby and hits
the circle in the middle of all the monsters' cells.
ON CIRCLE - The pieces suddenly start to move around. Almost
like a sliding puzzle. Then they start to randomly SINK
further into the ground. Light pours out of them, until all
of them give way to create THE PORTAL.
POV OFFICE ABOVE - Each of the Thirteen Cells LIGHT UP to
acknowledge their contents. 1... 2... 3...
WINTERS
Finally... finally!
ON GENERALS - they're still. Emotionless.
The light sequence gets to Leo's cell... it doesn't light up.
WINTERS
What?
His mind reels. Looks down at the cells. Nothing. Then it
hits him like a ton of bricks. He turns to the Generals...
WINTERS
What did you do?!
95
95
Our six Heroes all tear into the lobby. They turn back, an
army of ninjas closing in on them!
MICHAELANGELO
What do we do, dudes?!
DONATELLO
I'm working on it.
Raph grips his sais with renewed strength. Casey looks
around, putting things together mentally. Tension builds!
RAPHAEL
We get ready for round two.
ON CASEY IN CORNER - He reaches into his back, takes out a
hockey stick and - SMASH!!! - kills a LOBBY VASE. Suddenly,
sirens blare as the OUTSIDE BUILDING SECURITY SHUTTERS SLAM
DOWN just like in Act I!
The Ninjas are locked out!
82.
RAPHAEL
Yeah!
Everyone high fives Casey. Except April. She smiles.
APRIL
Nice work, Jones.
CASEY
I have my moments...
DONATELLO
Look!
OFF DON'S LOOK - the mayhem builds at the other end of the
vast lobby. The cells are glowing. The portal worsens.
DONATELLO
And that would be the swirling
vortex to another world, I assume.
(BEAT)
Cool.
They all run over. Mikey runs to a cell.
MICHAELANGELO
Leo! Is that you?
RAARRGH! - A claw swoops out. He dodges out of the way.
MICHAELANGELO
I guess that would be a "no".
ON RAPH - He finds Leo!
DONATELLO
Out of the way, please.
D
on places a small EXPLOSIVE on a key lock. Raph pulls Leo
out. LIFELESS.
RAPHAEL
Hey buddy! Come on, man. Leo,
please wake up!
Raph holds Leo in his lap on the floor. Looks like Leo is
DEAD. Raph's head falls low, as...
LEONARDO (O.S.)
Wh-wh-what took you s-so long?
WIDER - Leo is alive. Coughs and slowly gets his strength
back. Stands up. He and Raph look at each other. Leo can only
imagine what Raph's been through to rescue him. A beat.
RAPHAEL
Listen, I - I'm sorry.

83.
Leo forgives him. Moment is suddenly broken by an OS
SMASH!!!!
ANGLE UP - As WINTERS is thrown out the window of his
elevator office! He heads straight for a sword wielding
BRONZE STATUE... particularly the sword part. Closer...
closer... and...
..just misses it. WHUMP! He crashes onto the floor.
MOTIONLESS.
ON GROUP - They just stare at him. Back up to the office,
nearly 150 feet above them.
ON BALCONY ABOVE - Aguila looks down. Snarls.

96
Winters' body still lays on the floor. This is bad.
CASEY
Is he... is he dead?
Mikey takes out a hockey stick from Casey's bag and pokes
Winters' limp body. Nothing.
MICHAELANGELO
Yup. He's WAY dead, dude.
WINTERS GASPS FOR AIR! Startles everyone in the room.
ON EVERYONE - Their faces all drop as Winters stands up in
his mini-crater, brushes himself off and is perfectly fine!
Winters' mind is racing a mile a minute. Doesn't even notice
those around him.
WINTERS
(GROANS)
Raph can't take it any more. He draws his sais and thrusts
them at Winters. THAT gets his attention. Winters looks up in
awe at seeing the mutated freaks in front of him.
WINTERS
Fascinating...
SPLINTER
Mister Winters. We mean you no
harm.
RAPHAEL
No harm?! Whatever! I'm about to
give you piercin's in places you
never imagined if you don't tell us
what's going on.
O

84.
WINTERS
We were so close... so close.
Winters collapses on the floor. Head in hands.
WINTERS
This was our chance. We could have
changed it all.
APRIL
We know everything Max. We know
you're trying to recreate what
Yaotl started 3000 years ago.
N WINTERS - He looks up. Sees April. Exhausted, as we-

Raph comes to Splinter's room.
APHAEL
You wanted to see me Sensei?
SPLINTER
Sit down, Raphael.
RAPHAEL
Thank you, Master Splinter, for
your guidance.
(thinks, humble)
I can only hope that one day, I
will be able to begin the next
stage of my training like Leo.
Splinter smiles. Reaches into a box and takes out a similar
MEDALLION to the one given to Leonardo.
SPLINTER
That, my son, you already have.
(BEAT)
Our training works in mysterious
ways. But the answer that lies in
all our questions... is family.
Raph beams as he accepts the "badge". He excitedly stands up.
Splinter looks to the hallway where his eyes meet Leo's. They
exchange knowing smiles as Splinter winks and we-
DISSOLVE TO:

A ROCKIN' NUMBER PLAYS as we cap everyone's adventures.
Splinter walks through the lair. It's empty. He walks past
their "trophy room". He places the ornate head of WINTERS'
CANE on the shelf.

He sits down to meditate. But first reaches into his robe and
pulls out a TIN FOIL PACKAGE. He opens it up and smiles.
PLINTER
Ahh. Double chocolate fudge.
