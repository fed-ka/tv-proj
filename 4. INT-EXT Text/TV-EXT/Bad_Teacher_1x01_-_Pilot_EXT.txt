      A few Safety Patrol girls help students cross the street.  A 
      Mercedes flies by buzzing the School Zone like Maverick in 
       Top Gun .  An awkward LILY (12), spills her hot chocolate.

                                  LILY
                    Dammit!  Not again.    



      The Mercedes pulls up.  Out gets MEREDITH DAVIS (30), sexy, 
      confident, a woman other women hate.  She takes a sip of Ice 
      Blended then just tosses it half-full on the ground.  



      Gerry peels out.  Meredith is left with garbage bags of stuff 
      from her old house.  BRIE (32), a trophy wife, comes out.

                                  BRIE
                    Mere Bear!  I m so sorry.  It s 
                      everyone s worst nightmare... to 
                      accidentally sign a pre-nup.  You 
                    can stay in the guest house as long 
                    as you want.  But the remodel s not 
                    quite done yet so you have to use 
                    the bathroom in the main house.  
                    It s only a five minute walk.       

      Brie heads in.  Meredith takes a deep breath and follows.  



      The guest house is definitely unfinished.  A depressed 
      Meredith watches TV on a pull-out couch next to a pile of 
      bills.  She kills ants with the job listings.  Brie enters.  

                                  BRIE
                    Can you pick Lily up from school?                                                                                           4.


                                  MEREDITH
                    I m in the middle of stuff, Brie.  

                                  BRIE
                    I ll give you twenty bucks.      

                                  MEREDITH
                    C mon, it s your daughter.  Forty.    

                                  BRIE
                      Step-daughter.  Thirty.

      Meredith is not thrilled but needs the cash.  



      Meredith eats Cheetos.  Her fingers are covered in Cheeto 
      dust.  A snotty BOY walks out and gives her a look.  

                                  BOY #1
                    Parent pick-up is by the gym.  

      As the boy walks by, Meredith wipes her Cheeto fingers on his 
      backpack.  Lily comes out.  She s the Safety Patrol pre-teen 
      we saw earlier.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Lily.  Your mom sent me to get you.   

                                  LILY
                    That s what child molesters say.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Don t flatter yourself.  I m Brie s 
                    friend, Meredith.  I m staying in 
                    your guest house for a while.  

      Lily starts walking.  Meredith follows.  

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    It s a long walk, I hope you have 
                    something interesting to share. 

                                  LILY
                          (begrudgingly)
                    Today my social studies teacher, 
                    Ms. Guerrero, got transferred 
                    because she had a total breakdown.  
                    She liked Coach Kotsky but he 
                    didn t like her.  She hung pictures 
                    of his penis up all over school.  
                                                                                        5.


      As they walk past the exit to the school parking lot, they re 
      almost hit by a BMW.  The handsome DAD DRIVER jumps out.  

                                  DAD DRIVER
                    Oh my God!  I m so sorry!  I m 
                    late.  My ex-wife flaked and I had 
                    to do carpool.  I wasn t looking.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    My neck is really aching.  

                                  DAD DRIVER
                    I didn t even touch you.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    I feel dizzy and post-traumatized.  

                                  DAD DRIVER
                    I don t have my checkbook.  Sorry.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    You can t blame me for trying.  



      The school is buzzing.  A school bus pulls up.  Kids pour off 
      including Lily.  Behind Lily is Meredith, in a sexy top, 
      pencil skirt and Jimmy Choo high heels.  She turns heads.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    So, where do I go?

                                  LILY
                    Just walk through the main hall and 
                    the Teachers  Lounge is at the end.  

      A little boy then comes off the bus butt first lugging a 
      Louis Vuitton rolling bag.  He sets it next to Meredith.  

                                  MEREDITH
                          (handing him a dollar)
                    Thanks.  
                          (then)
                    Can I have seventy-five cents back?



      We see the nerdy girls from the Cold Open (Bronwen, Lily and 
      Kelsey), in neon reflective Safety Patrol gear, practicing.   

                                  LILY
                    See.  You raise the flag on your 
                    right but lower it on the left.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    That s awesome, Lily.                                                                                      16.


                                  LILY
                    I learned it at Safety Patrol Camp.   
                    We can practice this weekend.   

      Irene leads Meredith up to the group.  

                                  IRENE
                    Girls, this is the other Safety 
                    Patrol advisor, Ms. Davis.

                                  EVERYONE
                      Hey./Hi./Great.    

                                  MEREDITH
                    So, when do I get my stipend?

                                  IRENE
                    It s added to our paychecks.

                                  MEREDITH
                    When do we get our paychecks?

                                  IRENE
                    Friday.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Morning or after--
                          (just noticing)
                    Lily, you re in Safety Patrol?  

                                  LILY
                    I m captain.    

                                  MEREDITH
                          (to group)
                    I live in Lily s guest house.  

                                  LILY
                    She s friends with my dumb stepmom.

                                  MEREDITH
                    You stay late to help kids cross 
                    the street for free, that s dumb.

                                    BRONWEN
                    It s a great way to meet people. 

                                  KELSEY
                    You re really pretty, Ms. Davis.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I know.  And I m also photogenic.                                                                                     17.


                                  LILY
                    Okay, Patrolers.  We re piling up.  

      Students wait to cross.  Lily heads out.  The other girls 
      unfurl their flags.  Meredith sits in a folding chair.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    I ll be here.  Supervising.

                                  IRENE
                    Yeah.  Me too... after I help a 
                    little bit.  

      Irene walks off.  Meredith pulls out a magazine marked  DO 
      NOT REMOVE FROM LIBRARY .  Mean girls, BELLA (14) and JAMIE 
      (14), walk up with a few boys.   

                                  JAMIE
                    Oh, look, it s the Nerd Patrol. 

                                  KELSEY
                    Wrong.  It s Safety Patrol.

                                  BELLA
                    Same diff.  Nice sashes, lesbos. 

      Everyone LAUGHS.  Meredith tries to ignore them.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    Thanks.  Because there s nothing 
                    wrong with being gay or bi-- 

      Meredith can t sit by.  She gets in the mean girls  faces.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Okay, move it along, Water Bra.  
                    And take Panty Lines with you.

      The mean girls huff off and their friends follow. 

                                    BRONWEN/KELSEY
                    Thanks, Ms. Davis./Thank you.    

                                  MEREDITH
                    You have to fight fire with fire.  
                    It doesn t get better right away.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    I hate the popular kids--  

                                  MEREDITH
                    This isn t therapy.  Unless you pay 
                    me a hundred and fifty dollars, 
                    then it can be anything you want.                                                                                        18.


      Bronwen and Kelsey look bummed.  Meredith SIGHS.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Lay low and wait for a few popular 
                    girls to get pregnant.  Then you ll 
                    move up socially.  I was popular 
                    but smart.  I was on the pill.  
                    Those girls aren t smart and have 
                      definitely let a guy go  under the 
                    shirt .  It won t be too long.  

                                  KELSEY
                    Middle school is the worst.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Not worse than having a job.  I 
                    can t believe we have to do this 
                    all again tomorrow.  



      We hear a bell RING.  Irene and Meredith walk towards school.

                                  IRENE
                    My other car really isn t a ferret.

                                  MEREDITH
                    It s quite a bumper sticker.    

      A fancy car pulls up, out climbs JALISSA, from class.  
      JALISSA S DAD, a good-looking guy, gets out and hugs her.    

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Hey, Rich-girl-from-my-class.  What 
                    does your dad do?

                                    JALISSA
                    He s an investment banker.  I m 
                    gonna be one when I grow up.      

                                  MEREDITH
                    Don t.  That job emasculates men.  
                    You ll end up alone at forty trying 
                    to get your groove back by adopting 
                    a foreign baby or getting into 
                    wine.  But you did give me an idea.  



      Ginny and Kim regroup in the hall.

                                  GINNY
                    It ll be okay.  Life doesn t give 
                    you an obstacle you can t overcome.    

      Ginny turns to go down the hall and trips over a mop bucket.                                                                                      25.



      We come up in the middle of a talk between Meredith, Irene 
      and the girls.  They are listening intently to Meredith.            

                                  MEREDITH
                    ...and I ended up getting paid but 
                    it was a disaster.  Moral of the 
                    story:  Never text naked pictures.  
                    They ll be out there forever and 
                    you can t control the lighting on 
                    those camera phones.  You could end 
                    up with weird shadows everywhere. 

                                  IRENE
                    Men on eHarmony can be pretty 
                      persuasive.      

      Lily comes over.  

                                  LILY
                    You guys, we need to be doing our 
                    job.  Keeping kids safe.    

                                  KELSEY
                    We re talking to Meredith.

      Lily huffs off.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Next question before I get bored.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    I just got my period.  Is my life 
                    like totally over? 

                                  MEREDITH
                      Congratulations.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    I know.  I m a woman now.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Screw that.  You just got a free 
                    pass to miss anything you want.

                    grade-- you just have the say the 
                    magic word  cramps .  You ll be

                    I can get out of ballet.  Cool.                                                                                     26.


                                  MEREDITH
                      Manipulating the system.  Now that 
                    makes you a woman.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    Thanks for being honest.  Adults 
                    are never honest.  It s cool.  

      Meredith is genuinely touched.  We REVEAL Kim and Ginny 
      watching from afar.  Ginny is on full alert.  



      Lily rushes off the bus ahead of Meredith.  We see Ginny and 
      Kim behind them in Ginny s car.  They follow Lily and 
      Meredith to their house.  Lily goes in the front door.  
      Meredith goes around back.  Ginny notices the trash bins are 
      on the curb.  She gets out and opens them then closes them as 
      if she has gone too far.  She gets in her car and backs into 
      them, spilling their contents.  She rolls down the window.   

                                  GINNY
                    Oh my God!  I better clean that up.  

      Ginny gets out and digs through the trash.  She unwads a 
      piece of paper to find Meredith s resume.  Ginny sees the 
      door open.  Brie comes out with a smallish dog.

                                  BRIE
                    C mon, Pepsi.  Do your business. 

      Ginny puts the resume in her pocket.  Ginny jumps in the car 
      and floors it.  But it s still in reverse.  She hits the 
      trash can again making a big ruckus.  Pepsi begins to BARK.                                                                                       28.



      All is calm at Nixon Middle School until we HEAR an alarm go 
      off.  The fire alarm.  Kids begin pouring out of the 
      cafeteria including the Safety Patrol girls, Joel, Irene, 
      Ginny, Kim and Principal Carl.         

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    Everyone keep moving towards the 
                    faculty parking lot in an orderly 
                    fashion!  I said single file not 
                    triple file.      

      The kids head in an unorderly fashion to the faculty parking 
      lot.  Talking.  Yelling.  Running.  It s chaos.
