  A dimly lit tavern where every hour is happy hour. In ONE 
  SHOT that will last the scene, we move down a mile-long bar 
  filled with booze-happy REGULARS, through leatherette 
  booths, and stop on a small karaoke stage. Everyone cheers 
  as the immensely likable and slightly overweight MR. MARTIN, 
  30s, starts singing to the tune of The Archies  Sugar, 
  Sugar.

                                        MR. MARTIN

  CAMERA ROAMS to the dance floor, where the crowd bumps and 
  grinds. A lacy bra flies on stage, TAKING US back to Mr. 
  Martin, clearly a favorite here. He gamely swivels his hips.

                                        MR. MARTIN(cont'd)

  A sexy REDHEAD runs on stage and starts go-go dancing. Mr. 
  Martin sings to her for all he s worth.

  FREEZE FRAME on Mr. Martin, in all his small-time glory, and 
  WHOOSH to his smiling face. The words appear under him:

                                      The Victim

                                                                  FLARE TO WHITE.                                                                                    2.



  Snow walks upstairs with LAPD Detective OSCAR VEGA, 40s, 
  Latino, a seasoned veteran who moonlights as an ordained 
  minister. They pull on rubber gloves as they talk.

                      the Gospel boring. This week I m 
                        comparing the Fruits of the Spirit 
                      to actual fruit.

  Snow gives him a look. You gotta be kidding.

                                        SNOW
                        Moving on, Oscar.

                        says he was attacked in bed. 
                        They re walking down the hallway 
                        now.

                      Who was the attacker?

                      We don t know, but he apparently 
                        calls himself  The Creeper.  At 
                        least that s what was written on

                        Says she was sleeping in the spare 
                        room.

  They reach the FIRST OFFICER, standing outside a closed 
  door.

                        inhibiting access to the body.

                      Hey hey, time out. We got a murder 
                        scene growing cold in there, a 
                        killer running loose... every

                        It s a big dog.

                        I got a way with animals.

                                        SNOW
                        Same principles apply. It s all 
                        about taking control. Snow opens 
                      the door and confidently steps 
                        inside.



  On the queen bed, she sees the body of Mr. Martin on his 
  back, head on a blood-soaked pillow, face beaten and 
  bloodied. And then she sees the powerful PRESA CANARIO 
  attack dog standing by the bed, growling menacingly. Snow 
  speaks firmly.

                                        SNOW
                        Sit!
                                (the growl 
                                  intensifies)
                        I said... sit!
                                (the growl turns 
                                  rabid)
                      If you don t sit, right now --

  The dog charges. Shit. Snow barely has time to run out --



  -- and slam the door. The dog BARKS relentlessly on the 
  other side.

  Snow looks at Vega.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                      out by the weeds of pride.

  Snow smiles weakly. As the dog barks, CAMERA RISES straight 
  up, THROUGH the plaster of the ceiling, to reveal directly 
  over their heads --



  In a gabled attic, filtered moonlight through an air vent 
  finds Tom curled up in a fetal position, frozen in terror. 
  He wears bloody white band gloves. Beside him rests his 
  backpack covered with skateboard patches.

  Tom s world has just changed forever. As he closes his eyes 
  tightly, willing the nightmare to go away, trying to shut 
  out the MUFFLED BARKING below --

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.

  FADE IN:



  Snow takes photos of the body with her digital camera. Vega 
  and the First Officer stand by the door drinking Starbucks.

                                        FIRST OFFICER

                        Detective Snow likes to record the 
                        crime scene in its virgin state.

                        Okay. Start the parade.

  As Vega enters, followed by the First Officer, a crime scene 
    PHOTOGRAPHER, and the CORONER, we FLOAT over to the bed 
  until we re looking straight down on the battered Mr. 
  Martin. PUSH INTO his face. Suddenly, Mr. Martin s injuries 
  DISAPPEAR, he comes to life, and the bedsheets around him 
  SWIRL INTO --



  Mr. Martin sits at the bar holding a beer. The Redhead who 
  was go-go dancing on stage hangs all over him. HOUSE MUSIC 
  plays in the background. A CHYRON appears on screen that 
  says: Four Hours Earlier.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        ...I try to turn all my lesson 
                        plans into songs. The kids seem to 
                        like it.

                        such a gift. Will you take me home 
                        tonight?

  He holds up his ring finger, which has a gold band.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        Sorry, I m a happily married man.

  Off his tired smile --



  BARB MARTIN, Mr. Martin s wife, folds laundry on the kitchen 
  table. She s a plain woman, bored with life.

                                        MRS. MARTIN
                      For God s sake, Glenn. How long s 
                      it take to walk a dog?

  Mr. Martin unleashes the Presa Canario, which trots off.

                      it right, okay?

  Mrs. Martin stops folding and looks up. Seeing her husband 
  so raw, she feels a touch of sympathy. Or maybe it s pity.

                                        MRS. MARTIN

                        promise. Go upstairs and sleep it 
                        off.

  She resumes folding. As Mr. Martin heavily trudges to the 
  stairs, a DRUM CADENCE starts playing. The rhythm takes us 
  --



  The band members break ranks and flood into the band room, 
  laughing and joking. FIND Tom putting down his drum. He 
  removes his headpiece, sees the broken feather, holds it 
  straight. It flops back down. Oh well. WILLIE, a long- 
  haired skate rat, walks up and sees everyone changing.

    A big-bellied TUBA PLAYER struts by with no pants.

  He starts playing the tuba and dancing around in his band 
  jacket and underwear. The trombonists join in the act with 
   headchops  -- rapidly bending and crossing over each 
  other s heads with trombones. A pretty and petite girl named 
  KRISTI calls out.

  A TV SET

  A paramedic tries to resuscitate Patrick Swayze in the back 
  of an ambulance. After a beat, the paramedic looks up at 
  Demi Moore with a hopeless expression. REVEAL that we re --

                                                                              CUT TO:



  Tom s MOM and DAD sit on a well worn couch, zoning in front 
  of the TV watching  Ghost.  A lazy mixed-breed TERRIER lies 
  with his head in Dad s lap. Tom enters the messy living 
  room.

                                        TOM
                      Hi, I m home.

                                        MOM
                      Hi honey.

  But his parents are too engrossed in Patrick s death scene 
  to look up. They remain glued to the TV, where the ghost of 
  Patrick, also in the ambulance, yells at the paramedic --

                                        PATRICK SWAYZE
                        Don t stop! I m not dead!

                                        TOM
                        Okay, I m going to bed. G night.

  Tom heads to his room. His Dad waves goodnight, but keep his 
  eyes on the TV, where Demi grabs the dead Patrick and begins 
  to cry in long terrible sobs.                                                                                    12.



  Tom enters his room, shuts the door, and turns off the 
  light. He opens his bedroom window and climbs out into the 
  night.



  Willie turns off the lights and looks at Tom.

  Snow stands with the startling image of Mrs. Martin in a 
  sexy nightgown smeared with blood, along with her hands and 
  arms.

                                        SNOW

                        You re doing a great job, Mrs. 
                        Martin.

  The crime scene photographer takes close-up shots of all the 
  blood on Mrs. Martin. Vega, hovering silently, points to 
  some blood on her leg. The photographer kneels down to shoot 
  it. Snow tries to keep her calm.

                                          SNOW(cont'd)
                      So what d your husband do for a

                        loved him. Why... why would...

  She just can t make sense of it. She fights back tears. The 
    photographer finishes. Snow nods and the two men quietly 
  leave the room, shutting the door behind them.

                                        SNOW
                        Mrs. Snow, we need to record your

                      Oh.

  Mrs. Martin, humiliated, awkwardly slips off her nightgown, 
  trying her best to cover her body. Snow politely looks away. 
  She spots a romance novel and batteries on the nightstand.

                                        MRS. MARTIN(cont'd)

  Snow turns to take the nightgown from the naked Mrs. Martin.

                      You get dressed. We ll talk 
                        afterward.

  Snow heads out with the nightgown. HOLD on the face of Mrs. 
  Martin, bloody, shocked, distraught. Suddenly, the blood on 
  her DISAPPEARS and the room around her SWIRLS INTO --



  Mrs. Martin, wearing what we saw her in earlier, clears the 
  top of the stairs carrying the basket of now folded laundry.



  She enters to find Mr. Martin passed out in bed, with a loud 
  chainsaw SNORE. He appears to have gotten halfway undressed 
  before he crashed. Setting down the laundry basket, Mrs. 
  Martin smiles at her husband and pulls the blanket over him.



  Mrs. Martin stands outside the bedroom door, eagerly hunched 
  over the cordless phone. We still hear Mr. Martin snoring.

                                        MRS. MARTIN

  Mrs. Martin yanks Arman into the spare bedroom, kissing him, 
  mauling him, sliding her hands under his jeans to grab his 
  firm young ass. Arman can t wipe the smile off his face.

  Mrs. Martin starts to unbuckle the Russian s belt. CLOSE on 
  her face, impetuous, naughty. Abruptly, we CUT TO --



  CLOSE on Mrs. Martin s face, shaken. She sits across from 
  Snow and Vega. She s dressed now in conservative clothes.

                        I couldn t help but notice the 
                        amount of blood on your hands and 
                        arms.

                      I m just trying to figure out how 
                        your husband s blood got all over 
                        you.

                                        MRS. MARTIN
                        I don t know. I sat on the bed to 
                        make sure... I thought he might 
                        still be...
                                  then)(
                      You think I did that in there?

  Snow turns to Vega and speaks softly.

                                        SNOW
                        Isn t compassion one of the Fruits 
                      of the Spirit, Oscar?

                      Not technically.

                                  starts crying)(
                        When I saw Glenn dead, I fell onto 
                      the bed... I held him. What was I 
                        supposed to do? He was my husband. 
                        I loved him.

  Snow shoots Vega a look. He shrugs. Sorry. Off the 
  sympathetic figure of Mrs. Martin in tears, CUT TO --



  Mrs. Martin, head arched back, crying a different kind of 
  tears with Arman on top of her. As they knock it out, he 
  talks low and dirty in Russian.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

                      Ti lyubeesh papeenu peesku sassate!

  Mrs. Martin digs her fingers into Arman s back, biting her 
  tongue to keep quiet.



  Tom sits up now, still afraid, but pulling himself together. 
  From below, he hears the MUFFLED VOICES of police officers. 
  Tom looks around his prison searching for an escape. His 
  eyes stop on the gable vent pouring in filtered moonlight.


  CLOSE ON THE GABLE VENT

  Tom ENTERS FRAME and tries to pull the vent free. No luck. 
  Screws hold it in place. Tom s fear is fast fading in favor 
  of self preservation. He pulls a handful of coins from his 
  pocket, finds a penny, and inserts it into the head of the 
  screw. With some effort, the screw rotates a quarter turn.

  As Tom sets to the arduous task of slowly unscrewing the 
  vent, CAMERA LOWERS straight down, THROUGH the ceiling 
  plaster, to pick up --



  Snow and Vega walk down the stairs together, passing various 
  crime scene PERSONNEL on their way to the kitchen.

                                        VEGA
                      The wife reported the body. They 
                        were all alone. And she s the 
                        spouse. You know the statistics.

                                        SNOW
                        Mrs. Martin may be hiding 
                        something, but she didn t kill her 
                        husband.

                                        VEGA
                      Let me guess. You can feel her 
                        pain?

                                        SNOW
                      No. Okay, yes.

                        I think I ll keep her on the 
                        suspect list just the same, if you 
                        don t mind.

  They stop to talk. At the kitchen counter, Detective Trainee 
  BRIAN LUCAS -- late 20s, gentle nature -- sees them arrive.

                                        SNOW
                      I m not saying the marriage was 
                        great. From the look of the chick 
                      lit and double A batteries on the 
                        nightstand, I m guessing she slept 
                      in that spare room a lot. But she 
                        loved him.

  Lucas tentatively approaches.

                        Detective Vega? I examined all

                                        LUCAS
                        Nothing of value seems to be 
                        missing. A beer bottle was knocked 
                        over on the counter. I bagged it 
                      for evidence. As far as I can tell, 
                        nothing else appears to be out of 
                        place...

  As Lucas talks, we PAN across the house. During the pan, the 
  lights FADE and crime personnel VANISH. When we reach the 
  FRONT DOOR, the house is dark and empty. We are now --


  (FLASHBACK)

  Back in the house before the crime. Tom, wearing white band 
  gloves, holds a curtain back for Willie to crawl in through 
  a window. Willie freezes when he hears MUFFLED SOUNDS of 
  Mrs. Martin having sex with Arman. They speak in hushed 
  voices --

                                        WILLIE
                        Somebody s making the beast with

                        house.

                        Fine. Let s find a souvenir and go.

  Tom disappears into a different room to search. STAY with 
  Willie, who walks to the kitchen. He takes out a pen and 
  writes  The Creeper  on the refrigerator door.

  IN THE LIVING ROOM Willie, swigging a beer bottle, finds Tom 
  in the living room.

                                          WILLIE(cont'd)
                        There s some icy cold ones in

                        Nothing for me.

  Tom is desperately searching for something. It seems like 
  he s searching for something specific. Willie is impatient.

                                        WILLIE
                        C mon, grab something and let s go. 
                        That ceramic hula girl looks 
                        perfect.

                        I don t want that.

                      You shopping for something 
                        specific?  Cause I can drive you to 
                      the mall.

  Abruptly, they hear a DOOR OPEN and giggling.

                                        ARMAN (O.S.)
                        Thank you for phone call. I hope to 
                      see you soon.

  Tom and Willie exchange a look of panic. Willie hurriedly 
  sets down his beer but knocks it over as he and Tom race out 
  the front door.



                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

  The gruesome sight of Mr. Martin s bloodied and battered 
  face. Vega watches the coroner examine the body. Mr. 
  Martin s hands are now bagged to protect trace evidence.

                                        CORONER

                      of attack.

  Behind them, Snow slowly circles the room, looking for 
  anything out of place.

                                        SNOW
                      He wasn t sleeping. His wife heard

                        What about the time of death?

  The coroner removes a meat thermometer inserted deeply into 
  the area below Mr. Martin s rib cage and checks the reading.

                        hours.

                      So somewhere around midnight.

  Snow stands over a dresser.

                                        SNOW
                        Hey, didn t Lucas say nothing of 
                        value was missing?

                                        VEGA
                        That s right.

                                        SNOW
                        Take a look at this.

  Vega joins Snow to find a dusty dresser top full of bowling 
  trophies. Snow points to one round area that s dust-free, 
  suggesting a missing trophy.

                                        VEGA
                        Wouldn t exactly classify a bowling 
                        trophy as an object of value.

                                        SNOW
                      It is if it s our murder weapon.

  Vega reacts to that possibility. The room grows DARK as we 
  PAN from Vega to the dusty dresser, where the missing trophy 
  now sits. We are --



  Back in the room before the crime. From the bowling trophy, 
  we PAN to find Mr. Martin snoring peacefully in bed. From 
  there, we MOVE to the window and look out to see Tom walking 
  nervously up to the house.                                                                                    25.



  Tom slips into the house wearing his white gloves and closes 
  the front door. He turns to see the Presa Canario, haunches 
  up, growling menacingly. Oddly, he smiles.

                                        TOM
                      Hey Skipper... come here, boy.

  The dog stops growling. Tom drops to a knee and Skipper 
  comes to him, tail wagging, and slathers his face with dog 
  licks. Tom scratches behind his ear, just the way Skipper 
  likes it.

  In a SERIES OF CUTS, Tom searches the house... an office... 
    a bathroom.... inside a closet... before opening the door to 
  --



  Tom sees Mr. Martin crashed in bed. And on the floor by the 
  bed, Tom spots what he came for -- his backpack covered with 
  skateboard patches.

  Tom creeps over to retrieve it. He s almost there... when 
  Mr. Martin stirs and opens his eyes. Seeing a figure in his 
  room, he sits up with a start -- and recognizes the 
  intruder.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        Tom? Is that you?

  Tom is busted but he wants the backpack. Off his indecision 
  --



  Mrs. Martin, asleep in the spare room, wakes to the sound of 
  DISTANT SHOUTING. She sits up. What s going on? The yelling 
  suddenly stops. Mrs. Martin fumbles for the light. Turns it 
  on. Finds her slippers.



  Mrs. Martin hurries up the stairs, calling out --

                                        MRS. MARTIN
                        Glenn?                                                                                    26.



  Mrs. Martin enters through the open door. She sees her 
  husband lying motionless on the bed, covered in blood.


  INSIDE THE CLOSET

  Through the closet door that he holds ajar, Tom peeks out to 
  see Mrs. Martin stumble to the bed, sink onto the mattress, 
  and let out a guttural WAIL. Tom shuts the closet door.


  IN THE BEDROOM

  CLOSE ON Mrs. Martin, who collapses over her husband s body 
  in tears. TILT UP to the face of Snow. The detective stands 
  over the bed looking down. The LIGHTS brighten and the room 
  MORPHS back into a crime scene. We are now --



  Back in the room after the crime. Snow stands over the now 
  empty bed. The body has been removed and the coroner is 
  gone. Vega and Lucas watch Snow act out movements as she 
  speaks.

                                        SNOW
                        Okay, so the killer stood over the 
                        bed, grabbed the statue, and whack 
                      -- right?

                                        LUCAS
                        Right. Why?

                                        SNOW
                      No idea. But before the lethal 
                        blow, the victim s wife heard her 
                        husband shouting from the spare 
                        room downstairs.
                                (to Oscar, jabbing 
                                  him)
                      Or so she says.
                                  then, continuing)(
                        When she heard the shouts, she 
                        hurried upstairs to check on her 
                        husband.

  Lucas gets what she s going for.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

                        How d the killer get away? Not down 
                      the stairs. He would ve run into 
                      the wife.

                                        SNOW
                      So where d he go?

                                        VEGA
                        I checked the windows in here. They 
                        were all locked. Painted shut, in 
                        fact.

  The detectives look around. Snow spots the open closet door. 
  She walks over and looks inside. Empty. She sees a foreign 
  substance on the ground. Bends down. We GET LOW to see WHITE 
  PARTICLES in the carpet. Snow brushes some into her hand.

                                          VEGA(cont'd)
                        What is it?

                                        SNOW
                        I don t know. Plaster maybe?

  She looks up to see a 3x3-foot square cut into the ceiling 
  plaster, outlining a removable attic door. Off Snow --



  DARKNESS. The 3x3 plaster panel slides back and LIGHT floods 
  the crawlspace from below. After a beat, a head pokes up 
  with a flashlight. It s Snow. She makes a horrible face.

                                        SNOW
                      Oh God, it stinks something fierce 
                      up here.

                                                                            INTERCUT:                                                                                    28.



  Vega and Lucas stare at the bottom half of Snow, who has 
  climbed built-in shelves in the closet to check the attic.

                                        VEGA
                        What s it smell like?

                                        SNOW
                        Pee.

  Snow shines her flashlight to reveal a glistening PUDDLE on 
  the area of plywood where Tom was hiding.

                                        LUCAS
                      Cat pee?

  Snow shines her flashlight higher to reveal dark red BLOOD 
  STAINS on the beams that Tom was holding onto for support.

                                        SNOW
                        I don t think so.

  She quickly swings her flashlight beam around the dark 
  attic, searching for further signs of human presence.

                                          SNOW(cont'd)
                        Lucas, get outside, fast. Tell the 
                        blue suits to expand the perimeter, 
                      and lock it down. We might have a 
                        killer on the property.

  Off her urgency --

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.

                                      ACT THREE


  FADE IN:



  The window slides open and Tom climbs back inside. He unzips 
  his backpack and pulls out the bowling trophy caked with 
  died blood, along with his bloody white gloves. Tom hears a 
  CREAK and looks up to see --

  His sister LULU, 8, standing at the bedroom door in her PJs. 
  She looks at the trophy in his hands.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                                        LULU
                        What d you win?

                                        TOM
                        None of your business, Lulu. Go 
                        back to sleep.

  But Lulu keeps staring at the trophy. The terrier slips into 
  the room through the open door and jumps on Tom s bed.

                                        LULU
                        What s all over it?

  Tom shoves the trophy and gloves into a pillowcase.

                                        TOM
                        Just dirt. Go to bed.

                                        LULU
                      If I m tired for my piano lesson in 
                      the morning, I m telling Mom and 
                      Dad you woke me up.

                                        TOM
                      You tell Mom and Dad anything, 
                        you re dead.

  It s an ominous threat from Tom. Lulu makes a face at her 
  big brother and shuts the door. Tom, riddled with anxiety, 
  takes the trophy bundle and hides it on the top shelf of his 
  closet.


  IN BED - LATER

  Tom lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, sweating and 
  scared. He can t sleep. Tom gets up, startling the terrier 
  sleeping at his feet, goes to the closet, and takes down the 
  trophy.

  Tom climbs back into bed and hugs the murder weapon close to 
  his chest as his mind races, trying to figure out what to 
  do.



  Snow enters the house carrying a bag from 7-11 and quietly 
  moves through a dark house, filled with mostly secondhand 
  furniture.

  She hears a noise in the backyard.

  Putting her hand on her gun, she yanks open the sliding 
  glass door and turns on the porch light.



  CLOSE on the blood-encrusted bowling trophy and bloody 
  gloves inside the pillowcase. Tom checks them, ties off the 
  top of the pillowcase, and shoves it into his backpack.



  Lulu practices piano with her Mom.

                                        MOM
                        Watch your tempo, sweetie... you re 
                        rushing.

  Nearby, Dad sits with a PARTY PLANNER, a 40-year-old woman 
  with fading beauty, who s showing photos of herself dressed 
  shamelessly in various fairy and princess costumes.

                                        PARTY PLANNER

                        package, would you be the princess 
                        they send?

  Tom enters the chaos, backpack over his shoulder. If anyone 
  looked up, they d see his exhaustion, but they re all busy.

                                        TOM
                      I m going skating with Willie.

  His Dad acknowledges his son again with a hand wave but 
  keeps his focus on the princess, who smiles and winks.

  Tom heads out, past his Mom and sister on the piano.

                        Bye.

                        Wrists up, honey. Keep  em up.

  Tom disappears without ever being seen.



  A white room with a metal desk and a video camera high in 
  the corner. Snow and Vega sit across from a tired Mrs. 
  Martin.

                                        SNOW

                      We checked your bank records. You

                        I work with Arman at the 99 Cent 
                        Store. He needed a down payment for 
                        a van. He just moved here from 
                        Chechnya.

                        I invited Arman over when Glenn 
                        passed out, but he had nothing to 
                      do with this. He was long gone

                        loved my husband. He just... wasn t 
                        doing it for me. No ambition, no 
                        fantasies.

                        Yeah. It came with his credit card. 
                        Guess what? I get a whopping 
                        thousand dollars. Now I gotta find 
                        a full-time job and probably sell 
                      the house, too. Some motive for 
                        murder, huh?

  Snow and Vega exchange a look. So much for the wife.



  Detective BOYD BLOOM, 50s, looks over the Murder Book, 
  filled with photos and reports. He sits behind a cluttered 
  desk in a station that looks like an accountant s office -- 
  metal desks, overflowing file cabinets, unflattering light.

  Boyd, a paper pusher with an ass to match, supervises lower- 
  grade detectives. His desk is his domain, plus the snack 
  room, the only places he goes. He looks up at Snow and Vega.

                        homicide, Lucas. Just news.

                        Okay. The  news  is that the 
                        partials we found on the beer 
                        bottle at the crime scene match 
                        prints from a recent series of hot 
                        prowls in the larger valley area. 
                      The intruder looks for unlocked 
                        doors, windows. And... he leaves a 
                        signature.

  Lucas proudly hands a folder to Boyd. He opens it to see 
  PHOTOS of  The Creeper  written on walls in black ink.

                        believe this  Creeper  is breaking

                        Teenagers are bored. Messy. They 
                        test authority. And the victim was 
                        a high school teacher.

  Vega takes the folder and looks over the photos.

  Snow stands against an ND background, observing something 
  offscreen. Lucas enters and hands her a folder.

                        I talked to Suarez there. His alibi 
                        doesn t kick in until after 
                        midnight. Do we have an official

  REVEAL that they are in a morgue watching the oldest Medical 
  Examiner in L.A. perform an autopsy. DR. BETTY MARION, 70s, 
  stays current on all the latest technology, but she trusts 
  her instincts foremost. She stands over the body of Mr. 
  Martin, his skullcap removed and body split down the front.

                                        DR. MARION
                        Don t rush me.

                        need to leave...

  But Lucas steps forward, fascinated. Dr. Marion removes the 
  STOMACH and holds it over a container. Using scissors, she 
  cuts open the wall and examines the contents.

                                        DR. MARION

                      Not till we ve had the samples 
                        analyzed, but Betty s never been 
                        wrong. So Suarez here has an alibi 
                        after midnight. What about this 
                        guy? Where was he?

  Snow takes a second photo from the folder. We can t see it.

                        I ll bag this for prints and run 
                       em against the partials we found 
                      at the crime scene. Nice move.

  As Vega picks up Willie s plastic cup with a paper napkin --



  Tom walks in the door with his dog and his backpack. He 
  shuts the door and turns to see -- Snow and Vega on the 
  couch with his Mom and Dad, eating birthday cake from paper 
  plates. In the background, the party planner, dressed as 
  Little Bo Peep, plays Duck Duck Goose with Lulu and her 
  princess friends.

                                        DAD
                        Hello, son. Have a seat. These 
                        detectives want to talk to you.

                                        SNOW
                      Hi again.

  Tom nervously smiles and sits, his backpack at his feet.

                                        VEGA
                        Willie Schubert was at Woodbridge 
                        Park with a friend on the night Mr. 
                        Martin was killed. We asked around 
                      and found out you two are pretty 
                        tight.

                                        DAD
                        Tom. Were you at the park with 
                        Willie?

                                        TOM
                        I came straight home after the 
                        game.

                                        MOM
                        I remember that. He went to his 
                        room.

                                        SNOW
                        Willie s your best friend. Has he 
                        told you anything that might help 
                      us?

  Tom looks down, fingering the zipper on his backpack, which
  holds the murder weapon.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    53.

                                        DAD
                        It s okay, son. If you know 
                        something, you need to tell the 
                        police.

                                        SNOW
                      You can start by telling us why you 
                        panicked when we showed up at the 
                        party last night.

  Tom, anguished, looks up at his parents.

                                        TOM
                      Is it okay to tell the truth if it 
                        hurts a friend?

                                        MOM
                      Oh, Tommy. You have to tell the 
                        truth.

  Tom reluctantly turns to the detectives.

                                        TOM
                        Willie was in Mr. Martin s house 
                      the night he was murdered. He was 
                        Creeping.

                                        SNOW
                        What s Creeping?

                                        TOM
                        It s like a game. Willie invented 
                      it. He breaks into houses while 
                        people are home. He tried to get me 
                      to try it, but I wouldn t...
                                (overcome by 
                                  emotion)
                        I think Willie killed Mr. Martin.

  Tom breaks down in tears. Whether real or not, we can t be 
  sure, but it doesn t matter. The tears feel real enough to 
  everyone in the room. Off Snow and Vega, closing in on the 
  wrong guy --

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.

  FADE IN:



  Snow sits on plastic lawn furniture, reading over a YMCA 
  brochure. Manny plays Grand Theft Auto on PlayStation 2.

                        Well you need to find something 
                        that s not boring, Manny. Something 
                        that doesn t involve sex or 
                        substances. Or Creeping.

  The phone RINGS. Snow answers.

  Boyd sits at his desk, talking on the phone.

                        It s Boyd. SID matched the prints 
                        from the kid s cup to the partials 
                      at the murder scene and the Creeper 
                        break-ins.

                      He was there. And he had a class 
                        with the victim. Failed it. I don t 
                        know if it s cause for murder, but 
                        there you go.

                      We need a warrant to search his

                        Thanks, Boyd.

  She hangs up and turns to Manny.

                      So did you decide?

                        Well what is you?

  Off her son, lost in his racing game --



  Tom sits on the bus holding his backpack. A young GANGBANGER 
  sits across from him, eyeing him. Tom looks down at this 
  feet to avoid his stare. DIP TO BLACK.



  CLOSE on Willie fast asleep in bed. RACK FOCUS to Tom, a 
  dark shadow creeping into the room, bowling trophy in hand. 
  Tom stops at the bed, staring down at his friend. DIP TO 
  BLACK.



  The detectives search Willie s room. Vega finds a piece of 
  drawing paper in his desk and shows it to Snow -- it s a 
  crude comic book image of The Creeper. DIP TO BLACK. Lucas 
  pulls something from under the bed. As he holds up the 
  bowling trophy, caked in blood --

                                                                  FLARE TO WHITE.



  Willie, face red from crying, sits on one side of the desk 
  next to a LAWYER. Vega sits on the other.

                                        LAWYER
                      My client has nothing to say.

                        clear up a few questions, he might 
                      be able to go home tonight. If 
                        not... he s looking at jail time, 
                        court dates, possible trial.

                        Trying to intimidate a minor? Nice, 
                        detective. I think we re done here.

  Willie can t stand it. He starts tearing up again.

                      No we re not! I didn t do it!



  CLOSE on a TV MONITOR with the black-and-white video feed of 
  the Interview Room, looking over Vega s shoulder at Willie.

  REVEAL Boyd watching the monitor from his desk. Snow stands 
  over him, along with Los Angeles County Assistant District 
  Attorney DONNA RIVERS, 40s, a smart and fair woman.

                      his prints and handwriting at the 
                        scene. The murder weapon under his 
                        bed. Best friend s testimony. All 
                        that s missing are the rainbow 
                        sprinkles on top.

  Off Snow, with no options --



  CLOSE on Kristi sleeping peacefully in a frilly bedroom. PAN 
  OFF her to the window, covered by a lacy curtain. An ominous 
  SHADOW moves outside. The figure slides open the window and 
  pulls back the curtain to reveal Tom.


  BACK ON THE BED

  Tom ENTERS FRAME and sits on the edge of the bed. Tenderly, 
  he reaches out and brushes back Kristi s hair. He bends down 
  and kisses her cheek. Kristi awakes with a start. She sits 
  up, scared, pulling the covers over her body.

  In that instant, Kristi recognizes Tom as a deeply disturbed 
  person, and he knows it. Sadly, he turns to climb out the 
  window. Off Kristi, more than a little freaked out --



  Tom stands in front of the chalkboard. PAN to Mr. Martin s 
  desk. Mr. Martin leans against it holding Tom s backpack.

                        something we need to discuss.

                                        TOM
                      The marijuana isn t mine.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        It s not the drugs I m worried 
                        about.

  The teacher pulls out a DIARY. Tom looks up, intensely 
  violated and humiliated, and takes a threatening step 
  forward. His body is coiled, ready to attack.

                                        TOM
                        That s my diary.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                      It reads more like a manifesto. 
                        You re holding a lot of hatred 
                        inside, Tom.

  Mr. Martin flips through pages. We can t see them clearly. 
  We re not meant to. But what we can make out is disturbing. 
  Violent drawings. Pools of blood. Bodies being tortured, 
  abused. It s a peek into a dark and dissociative world.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    63.

                        I wouldn t do any of those things 
                      in there. They re just private 
                        thoughts.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                      You know, you re not alone. 
                        Everyone feels different, Tom. When 
                        I was your age, I felt like an 
                        outsider, too.

                                        TOM
                        Give me my diary.

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        I ll make you a deal. You agree to 
                        show this diary to a counselor, 
                        I ll throw away the marijuana. If 
                      you don t, I ll turn them both over 
                      to the police.

  Tom stares at him, rocking on his heels, silently seething.

                                        MR. MARTIN(cont'd)
                      Not much we can do right before the 
                        weekend. I ll give you till Monday 
                      to think about it.

                                        TOM (V.O.)
                      But I didn t need the weekend to 
                        think about it. I had to get my 
                        diary...



  Mr. Martin stirs and opens his eyes. Seeing a figure in his 
  room, he sits up with a start -- and recognizes the intruder

                                        MR. MARTIN
                        Tom? Is that you?

  Tom is so close to getting what he came for. He goes for it 
  and snatches the pack, enabling Mr. Martin to grab his arm.

                                        MR. MARTIN(cont'd)
                        What re you doing in my house?

                                        TOM
                      Let go!

  Tom tries to pull away, but the large teacher has him 
  firmly.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    64.
  CONTINUED:

                                        MR. MARTIN
                      No! This has gone too far, Tom! I m 
                        calling the police!

  As Mr. Martin reaches for the phone with his free hand, Tom 
  looks around desperately and spots the bowling trophy on the 
  dresser. Tom picks up the heavy object and SWINGS with all 
  his might, clubbing Mr. Martin on the forehead.

  Mr. Martin falls back on the pillow, stunned, woozy. For a 
  surreal beat he just lies there. Rivulets of BLOOD cascade 
  down his face. He stares up at Tom, confused.

  Tom impulsively raises the bowling trophy and strikes the 
  defenseless teacher AGAIN, and AGAIN, and AGAIN. He stops, 
  looking down at what he did, breathing hard.

                                        TOM (V.O.)
                        I didn t plan to kill him. I just 
                        wanted what was mine....



  As we pick up Tom s confession, we find that he s now 
  telling his story to Snow and Vega in the station, with his 
  tearful parents present, along with A.D.A. Rivers.

                                        TOM
                        I couldn t let anyone else see it.

  Snow looks at Rivers, who nods. She s got what she needs.

                                        RIVERS
                        You re doing the right thing, Tom. 
                      The judge will go much easier on 
                      you with a signed confession.

                                        SNOW
                        I need to know... why? Why end a 
                        man s life? When Mr. Martin woke 
                      up, the most you were guilty of was 
                        breaking and entering. They 
                        would ve let you off.

                                        TOM
                      But I wouldn t be invisible 
                        anymore. I like to be invisible.

  As Tom signs his confession, DISSOLVE TO --                                                                                    65.



  An officer leads Tom away from his parents in handcuffs. As 
  his mother cries, and his father holds her, DISSOLVE TO --



  Lucas releases Willie from juvenile detention and claps him 
  on the back. Off Willie s smile of relief, DISSOLVE TO --



  Kristi, eyes red from tears, sits on the edge of her bed 
  with a newspaper. The headline reads: TEEN ARRESTED FOR 
  MURDER OF SINGING TEACHER. Off her sorrow, DISSOLVE TO --



  Tom, wearing a jail-issue jumpsuit, walks in single file 
  with other JUVENILE OFFENDERS. As they march ahead, DISSOLVE 
  TO --
