 African American, late thirties -  - ADAM POWELLCLOSE-UP:
opens his eyes from sleep. 

Adam sits up in bed, grabs his cell phone: 4:29AM. He has 
woken up before his alarm. He yawns just as his cell phone 
alarm rings at 4:30AM with a Philly Sound ring tone  WAKE UP 
EVERYBODY  by Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes. Adam shuts it 
off before it disturbs his wife. She stirs beneath the covers 
beside him. He touches her gently. She is still asleep.

Adam gets out of bed, naked, and walks to his bathroom in an 
upscale townhouse bedroom suite, picking up his briefcase. He 
enters the bathroom. We hear the water in the shower turn on.



Adam Powell, impeccably dressed, walks with his briefcase 
through the lobby past the NIGHT GUARD.

NIGHT GUARD
Early morning Mr. Powell. You in 
court today?

ADAM
Yes, Stewart. How s your son doing?

NIGHT GUARD
Studying for his LSATs now. Thank 
you so much for talking to him.

ADAM
Let me know how he does.

Adam gets on the elevator.



Adam walks to doors marked PHILADELPHIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY 
OFFICES. Adam unlocks the door with his own key. He enters 
and turns on the lights. He walks past empty offices and 
cubicles to his private office marked: ADAM POWELL DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     3



Adam turns the lights on in his office and locks his door for 
privacy. The sun is starting to filter through the windows. A 
well appointed office, carved wood walls, leather chairs, 
large desk in front of a large window, books shelves of law 
books, family photos of Adam s wife Billie, his children 
Travis and Lara, his parents Rodney and Grace Powell.

Adam takes off his jacket, placing it on his desk chair. He 
takes out the file he needs, scans it quickly. He then takes 
 PHOTOS OF A GRUESOME CRIME - THE BODIES OF TWO ADULT out
AFRICAN AMERICANS AND THEIR TEENAGE DAUGHTER. Adam looks at 
these photos, reminding himself of their violence. He begins 
to place these photos in a pattern on the floor as he 
rehearses his case. (We sense this is a ritual for Adam):

ADAM

CUT TO:



D.A. ADAM POWELL recounts the murder to three Judges 
 WITH PHOTOS OF THE BUTLER FAMILY, PHOTOS referring to: EASELS
OF THE TWO CONVICTED MEN, GRUESOME CRIME SCENE PHOTOS, etc... 

ADAM
Both Broderick and Francis Butler 
were found dead in their bedroom 
with multiple stab wounds to the 
neck, chest and stomach. 
Emily Butler was found dead between 
the living room and the kitchen 
with multiple stabs wounds about 
her neck, chest and back. DNA tests 
proved Emily Butler was raped by 
Terry Kaminski... 

Adam points to the easel:  a photo of at the TERRY KAMINSKI
time of his arrest: 19 years old, white-Polish American, a 
handsome young kid gone bad...

ADAM
...before she was killed by Jared 
Bankowski. Miraculously, Jenny 
Butler survived.

now 24 yrs old, attractive African American  JENNY BUTLER,
woman, sits solemnly behind the Prosecution table.

ADAM
This gruesome, racially motivated 
crime gripped our city and it s 
citizens for two years.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     6


ADAM
Terry Kaminski is currently serving 
a life sentence for rape, robbery, 
assault and accessory to murder. 
Jared Bankowski, who sits before 
you today, was found guilty of 
three counts of first degree murder 
with extreme atrocity...

early 40 s, White-Polish American working  - JARED BANKOWSKI
class, wearing an orange jumpsuit with hands and feet cuffed. 
He sits impassively, as if he has no interest in the outcome. 
Beside him sits his Appeals Lawyer, ALAN DALTON:

ADAM
He was sentenced to death by lethal 
injection. During his 9 years in 
Rockview, his appeals for clemency 
to convert his sentence to life 
imprisonment have been denied. 
Since the jury s verdict in 2003, 
the people of Philadelphia and 
Jenny Butler have been waiting for 
justice, as there is indisputable 
DNA evidence and eye witness 
testimony of Mr. Bankowski s guilt 
and of his remorseless disregard 
for the value of human life.

CAMERA ARRIVES ON SPECTATOR SEATED IN THE LAST ROW: 

white, Italian-German descent CHRISTINE ROSA - late twenties, 
attractive, aggressive, prone to impulsive emotions and 
actions - Christine is very interested in this case. She 
watches Jared Bankowski.

ADAM (O.S.)
It is the recommendation of the 
Philadelphia District Attorney s 
office that Jared Bankowski s final 
appeal for clemency be denied and 
the date for his execution be 
determined.

ON CHRISTINE; looking at the stone face of Jared Bankowski. 
She cares about this case for a reason we don t yet know.




END TEASER                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     7


ACT ONE



The front lobby is jammed with reporters and TV cameras. 
Christine walks down the corridor towards the lobby. She 
stops by the water fountain. From Christine s POV, she spies: 

Adam escorting Jenny Butler with two Security Men. When they 
see the reporters in the lobby, they stop. Adam is clearly 
protective of Jenny, instructing the Security Men to take 
Jenny out by way of another hallway. Adam and Jenny embrace. 
Jenny speaks her gratitude. Adam encourages her. (ALL MOS).

Christine watches Adam, left alone after Jenny exits with the 
Security Men. Adam considers the reporters a moment, then 
turns and crosses to the water fountain, where Christine 
stands, asking her with a smile:

ADAM
May I?

Christine smiles, stepping away. Christine watches Adam as he 
takes a sip of water, gathering his thoughts. He finishes.

ADAM
Thanks.

Adam walks back the way he came, disappearing around a corner 
out of Christine s view, entering a men s room.



Adam looks at himself in the mirror. Beat. He checks his tie, 
his appearance. He notices a tiny spot on his tie. He checks 
it in the light. Yes, it s a tiny spot. He opens his 
briefcase and removes another tie. He holds it up to his 
neck. He doesn t like it. Beat. Adam catches himself, feeling 
ridiculous for caring which tie he wears. Beat. He rehearses:

ADAM
One at a time folks.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     8



Adam - wearing his original tie with the tiny spot - walks 
into the lions den of reporters and TV cameras, confident, as 
reporters swarm around him, shouting questions. 

ADAM
One at time, folks.

Christine watches Adam from a new vantage point in the lobby.



Adam enters amidst a flurry of office activity as his 
assistant appears at this side; SONIAan Hispanic woman in  - 
her forties, fast talking, smart, efficient, loyal. They walk 
to his office as they talk:

SONIA
How did it go?

ADAM
Waste of time. Call your girlfriend 
at Appeals, spread the fear of God. 
I want an execution date by the end 
of the day tomorrow or we go to the 
press demanding one.  
(Sonia writes)
Push the staff meeting to 1:30. 
Tell Phillips and Weiss they have 
to re-do their briefs on the 
Stewart case by six, I want Teresa 
and Michael to prep me on the 
Webber continuance in my office 
before we go to court at 4, tell 
Duncan to prep the Issacs before I 
take their deposition and don t let 
Roberts out of this office until he 
finishes the damn Grazer-Lynch 
evidence analysis. 

SONIA
Roberts says his allergies have 
been acting up.

ADAM
He s allergic to deadlines. If he s 
not done by tonight, he s fired.

They enter Adam s office as they continue:



Adam walks into his office, followed by Sonia...                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     9


SONIA
Your phone list is on your laptop. 
Margot wanted you to call her as 
soon as you got out of court. Is 
today a coffee or tea day?

ADAM
Expresso and one of those little uh-
(makes a shape with hands)

SONIA
Biscotti. 

Sonia closes his door halfway to show him a tuxedo hanging.

SONIA
Your wife sent this over and said 
she ll meet you at the benefit.

ADAM
I already told her I m going to 
have enough time to go home and 
change.

SONIA
She says you re not and I believe 
her. Oh, and your mom called.

Sonia exits. Adam sits at his desk and dials the phone.

ADAM
 Uh, I think Hey Mama...(listens)
Billie s wearing some kind a gown. 
Call her at her office?...(listens) 
You won t bother her...(listens) 
Oh, you always look beautiful.

STEVENSON FOR GOVERNOR.  A black tie affair, with tables of 
Philadelphia s wealthiest and most powerful citizens.

sits at the dais among prominent Philadelphia citizens.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     11


ON THE DANCE FLOOR: Adam and his wife, BILLIEa successful  - 
partner in a private Equity firm, late thirties, African 
American, wearing a designer gown. Powerful, a knockout, she 
is the smartest person in the room besides her husband. 

As they slow dance, they discuss what s going on in the room.

BILLIE
Your mother looks good.

They look at the Powell family s table: GRACE, Adam s mother - 
nurturing, loving mother recovering from cancer treatment. 
TYRONE, Adam s older brother: 40 s, a Police Detective, his 
wife ANGELA. Adam s younger brother, JAMIE, also a cop, still 
in uniform, handsome, unmarried. (We will come to know these 
characters as the series progresses).

ADAM
Yeah, I called Dr. Leiber today. He 
says she s responding well this 
round. She was worried about the 
wig though. 

BILLIE
Looks pretty. You can t tell. 

ADAM
I told her to call you. Did she?

Billie shakes her head. They smile, both understanding why. 
As they dance, Adam and Billie spot his father on the dais:

 Adam s father, sixties, tough, a huge RODNEY POWELL:
presence, patriarch of the Powell family.  Seated beside him 
: ZALESKIon the dais is STANLEY A Robert Moses granite 
sculpted self made man from the Polish lower class. They are 
head to head, talking and laughing together.

ADAM
I want to know how much Stanley 
Zaleski paid to sit on that dais.

BILLIE
You should tell your father to keep 
his distance from him.

ADAM
Nah, he knows what he s doing.

BILLIE
Did you tell him you re 
investigating Zaleski?

ADAM
Dad gave me the idea. He s just 
playing him up there. Dad s a pro 
at stings.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     12


Billie is disturbed by this information, as she listens:

ADAM
The friendlier Dad acts the safer 
Zaleski feels. He s not looking for 
me to come after him. He relaxes. 
Goes about his business. We planned 
it all out.  

BILLIE
The man s retired and he s still 
playing cops and robbers with his 
son...Did you tell Margot?

ADAM
I will when the time s right. When 
I have all of them where I want 
them.

Billie is again disturbed, this time by Adam s ruthless tone.

BILLIE
Sounds like you re going after 
Margot too. Sounds personal.

ADAM
I m not. It s not. It s a big case 
for me, that s all. I ve got to 
keep everything tight on this one.

They dance a beat in silence, Billie thinking, until:

BILLIE
Oh, we should go. I forgot - Lara 
has this report for school. She 
needs help.

ADAM
A report on what? 

BILLIE
Your father.

INTERCUT:



Everyone has gone home. One light in one cubby hole.

Alone, Christine is still working. She opens the envelope 
from Barbotti and removes POLICE PHOTOS OF A NAKED JARED 
 taken after his arrest. Christine examines the BANKOWSKI,
photos intensely, making notes.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     13



Adam and Billie s 12 yr. old daughter - LARA - is in her bed 
struggling with her school report. Adam enters in his tuxedo. 
She looks upset. He sits on the bed

ADAM
Hey boo. You OK?
(Lara shakes her head)
Hey. Let me help. What s it about?

LARA
We had to pick a hero in real life 
and then compare it to these rules 
that classic hero stories use and I 
just don t get it.

ADAM
And you picked grandpa?

LARA
(panicking)
Yeah, but I don t think it works 
and I don t have time to start over 
and I don t know who else I can--

ADAM
OK. OK, lets make grandpa work. 
Tell me a hero story rule.

LARA
(reads assignment)
 Every hero leaves his own land or 
is exiled from his own land into a 
foreign land to start his quest . 
Grandpa grew up in Philadelphia.

ADAM
Not this neighborhood. Port 
Richmond. Very poor. But
what about this - grandpa was the 
first black policeman in an all 
white police force. So that s like 
being in a stranger in a foreign 
land, right? 

Lara nods and writes that down. 

ADAM
What else?                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     14


LARA
(reads)
 Every hero goes on a journey to 
find something of great value that 
is necessary to save their homeland 
or fight and defeat something, like 
a monster, that is a danger to 
their homeland . 

ADAM
OK. Well sometimes heroes don t 
bring back a thing, they bring back 
an idea that has great value for 
their community. Or they destroy an 
idea that s dangerous. When grandpa 
became police commissioner he 
destroyed the idea that a black man 
can t have power to enforce the 
law. And he helped his people. He 
used that power to make sure 
everyone who broke the law paid for 
it, no matter how much money they 
had, no matter what race.

LARA
But does that make somebody a hero?

ADAM
Making a right out of a wrong? 
Yeah. That s real hero stuff.



A small one bedroom. Furnished with little or no thought. 
Bare necessities. Take out food cartons line the mattress on 
the floor, upon which:

Christine is reading a pile of letters from the file of TERRY 
KAMINSKI, his Photo the same as on Adam s easel in court.

She removes 12 years of LETTERS FROM TERRY KAMINSKI written 
to THE INNOCENCE PROJECT. She reads:

TERRY KAMINSKI (V.O.)
My name is Terry Kaminski and I am 
serving a life sentence for a crime 
I did not commit....



 - on his bed in his cell,  30 years oldTERRY KAMINSKI - now
 BROTHERS KARAMAZOVreading  THE . Many books line his shelves 
as well as pads, letters and writing materials. A photo of 
him at 19 with his Mother and Father in happier days.                     untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     15


TERRY KAMINSKI (V.O.)
I have written over thirty letters 
to the Innocence Project in the 
hope that someone, someday, will 
believe my innocence...



CLARK RYLANCE - Lawyer, Law Professor, early forties, good 
looking, reliable, honest, secret crush on Christine - is 
working in his office, eating Indian food, reading a file. 

Christine enters and drops the TERRY on his  KAMINSKI FILE
desk.

CLARK
Again? How many times do we  have 
to go over this? 

CHRISTINECLARK
Wait...Clark, just let me...(standing up)
Christine, I told you, we 
can t do anything with this.

CHRISTINE
(overlaps)
Please. Just listen. Sit.
(Clark is about to speak)
SIT!

Clark obeys. Christine opens the file and explains:

CHRISTINE
OK. Terry Kaminski wrote letters 
every year since he was imprisoned. 
And we couldn t take the case--

CLARK
Because his semen was found in 
Emily Butler s body. DNA proved he  
raped her. She was 16...

CHRISTINE
Wait. I know. Wait. Now, in almost 
every letter he explains his 
arrest. But some early letters are 
more detailed than others. In a few 
of them, he mentions that after 
Jenny Butler ID d him at the police 
station, he was photographed by a 
police photographer.

She opens the file page to NUDE PHOTOS of TERRY KAMINSKI at 
19 years old. Clark reacts to the male nude photos;                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     16


CLARK
WOAH! Little early in the day for 
me, Christine.

CHRISTINE
There were no marks on his body.

CLARK
Again, his DNA was semen. Blood DNA 
proved Jared Bankowski committed 
the murders. 

CHRISTINE
WILL YOU SHUT UP!
(Clark is surprised)
Sorry. Sorry. I haven t slept. OK.
Now I thought,  Well if they took 
police photos of Terry Kaminski 
they must have taken photos of 
Jared Bankowski . Figures, right?

CLARK
I am now afraid to disagree with 
you so keep going.

CHRISTINE
There s no mention of police photos 
of Jared Bankowski either in the 
Defense discovery documents or on 
any DA s evidence list before 
trial. No photos of Bankowski after 
his arrest were used at trial. 
Which I thought was weird because 
of this--

 GRUESOME PHOTO OF VICTIM FRANCES BUTLER S She opens to a
BLOODIED HANDS AND FINGERS, SOME OF HER NAILS RIPPED OFF. 
Clark, eating Indian food, reacts to the graphic images; 

CLARK
Jesus!

CHRISTINE
Now, the DA s DNA case against 
Jared Bankowski was all about 
Frances and Emily Butler s 
fingernails - his DNA found under 
their nails because they both 
fought hard, his blood and skin 
samples under their nails meant 
they cut him.  I tracked down the 
police photographer. Guy named 
Barbotti. Retired. Lives in Lock 
Haven. Everything he s shot he s 
transferred to digital files.

 PHOTOS OF A NUDE JARED BANKOWSKIChristine shows him POLICE.                    untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     17


CLARK
(jokes)
OK, now you re doing it on purpose!

CHRISTINE
There s not a mark on him, Clark. 

Seriously, Clark examines the pictures. Jared Bankowski has 
no scratches or marks indicating a struggle.

CHRISTINE
Trial transcripts say the murders 
happened between 4:30 and 5:30 PM. 
Jared was arrested between 2:30 and 
3 AM that night. The crime scene 
blood samples they had on Bankowski 
were substantial. Only vampires 
heal that fast. Why didn t the 
Defense find these in discovery and 
use them at trial? Why didn t the 
DA s office have them on their 
evidence list?
(Clark is about to answer)
I ll tell you why. Because
no one asked for them.

CLARK
Well, Prosecution had positive DNA 
results...
(Christine about to speak)
 was ID d by an eye --AND Bankowski
witness.

CHRISTINE
A 12 year old girl with the flu 
hiding under a couch who just 
watched her family murdered.

Beat. OK, something s not right. They both feel it.

CLARK
The Court of Appeals decision was 
announced. Clemency was denied. 
They re scheduling Bankowski s 
execution date for next month.

Christine registers this news. But Clark is disturbed by 
something in what Christine is presenting.  Cautiously: 

CLARK
Start over. 



END OF ACT ONE.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     18


ACT TWO



- sits at his desk before; Adam, Clark and  - 60 s JUDGE HALL
his INNOCENCE PROJECT Superior,  a Barry Sheck-RON FISCHMAN,
like devoted lawyer.

JUDGE HALL
You had no knowledge of them during 
pre-trial discovery?

ADAM
No we did not, your honor. I was 
Margot Stevenson s assistant DA on 
this case and we never had these 
photos in our possession. If 
they re authentic. I mean the 
timing on this is a little suspect.

CLARK
We re not here to accuse the DA s 
office of any wrong doing.

ADAM
Clark, come on. Margot s running 
for Governor. This case made her. 
And suddenly after 12 years - 
somebody finds these photos no one 
ever saw at trial and lays them at 
your doorstep, with what proof? Or 
was it just a anonymous donation to 
your organization?

RON FISCHMAN
The Innocence Project has no 
political affiliations.

ADAM
Because if there was a donation, 
you know I ll find out about it.

RON FISCHMAN
This case made your career too, 
didn t it, Adam?                    untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     19


ADAM
I m not running for office, Ron.

RON FISCHMAN
You sound like you are.

Adam looks pissed off. He doesn t like his ambition showing.

JUDGE HALL
Boys, don t make me separate you. 

RON FISCHMAN
Your honor, these photos - yes 
they re a tiny wrinkle to base this 
request on, I agree. But before we 
execute someone for the first time 
since 1999, we think it s worth a 
new DNA test. 

Adam sees the Judge is listening, considering to agree:

RON FISCHMAN
All we want to do is take a new 
blood sample of Jared Bankowski and 
test it against the original crime 
scene blood samples used at trial.
There s nothing in this request 
that would cause the DA to resort 
to accusations of coercion.

ADAM
Coercion? Ron, what you hear in my 
voice is outrage. Jenny Butler was 
an eye witness to her family being 
butchered by Jared Bankowski. He 
was proven guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt. Now you re 
sitting here telling me the 
murderer s rights are more 
important than the victim s. And 
what happens to this city when news 
gets out that Bankowski s getting 
another DNA test? You want to be 
responsible for the  01 riots 
again? 13 billion dollars worth of 
damage, 4700 arrests?

Beat. They look to the Judge who considers the issue. Then:

JUDGE HALL
No execution date has been set. No 
public announcement s been made. 
How long an extension are we 
talking, Mr. Fischman?                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     20


CLARK
The fastest we could get this done 
is in four weeks and that s pushing 
it. Five would be better.

JUDGE HALL
You ve got four weeks and one day. 
(checks calendar)
It is now April 9th. We ll set his 
execution for May 8th. 
(to Adam)
Seems reasonable.

ADAM
May I make a request? If we re 
going to do a new test, I suggest 
we keep it out of the press. 

RON FISCHMAN
I agree. Again, this isn t a 
political issue for us.

Adam and Clark exchange a look.  They know each other. Judge 
looks at calendar.

JUDGE HALL
All right. Adam, you ll have your 
office send the original DNA 
samples over.

ADAM
As soon as we locate them.

RON FISCHMAN
Sooner than later. And with the 
judge s permission, we d like to 
use our own DNA lab. Not the DA s.

The Judge nods. Adam is clearly resentful of the implication. 

SMASH CUT:


CLOSE-UP: MARGOT STEVENSON.

MARGOT (PRE-LAP VO)
BULLSHIT IT S NOT POLITICAL...



An imposing office reflecting the power and authority of the 
state s chief law enforcement official. Margot is furious 
after Adam informs her of the situation by phone:

WE INTERCUT ADAM AND MARGOT PHONE CONVERSATION FROM THEIR 
RESPECTIVE OFFICES:                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     21


ADAM (ON PHONE)
You think the Governor s in on it?

MARGOT (ON PHONE)
You know why I m so sure? Because 
the timing is so ridiculously 
obvious. The man has absolutely no 
imagination! And Ron Fischman. Acts 
like he s some super hero of the 
people! I slept with him. A super 
hero he s not!
(quiet intensity)
Don t make this easy for them. Take 
your time giving them those DNA 
samples. Bastards are trying to dig 
my grave, I m not going to hand 
them the Goddamn shovel.

ADAM (ON PHONE)
Margot, nobody s burying anybody. 
The photos are bullshit. They never 
existed or I would have seen them. 

Margot trusts Adam confidence. She switches subjects:

MARGOT (ON PHONE)
Have you thought about it? 
Lieutenant Governor?

ADAM (ON PHONE)
I m still thinking.

MARGOT (ON PHONE)
We always made a great team, Adam. 
I miss that.

Adam doesn t miss it.



A private Death Row visitors room. The Guard shackles Jared 
to a metal table then steps outside of the room.

Ron, Clark and Appeals Attorney Alan Dalton sit before Jared. 
He betrays nothing in his expression. He has a dead man s 
eyes - lifeless, resigned.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     22


RON FISCHMAN
...so I m not suggesting there s a 
reason for hope just yet. 

ALAN DALTON
But it s worth a shot Jared. We 
have a nurse outside waiting to 
take your blood sample--

JARED
Who said you re taking my blood?

RON FISCHMAN
Mr. Bankowski, the only reason 
we re here is because there s a 
small possibility that your DNA 
test results were incorrect, which-- 

JARED
You re not taking my blood.

RON FISCHMAN
Why not? Are you guilty, Mr. 
Bankowski? Because if you are, we 
won t waste our time.

JARED
Well I m guilty of something or I 
wouldn t be here, would I? That s 
what my mother s priest tells me.

ALAN
Jared, when a Judge gives you an 
extension you take it. 

JARED
To extend what? They re not gonna 
let me out til I m dead, one way or 
another. I checked the TV. All my 
shows were cancelled. There s 
nothing to hang around for.

RON FISCHMAN
Let me ask you, why did you go 
through all those appeals for a 
clemency if that s how you feel?

JARED
(Beat)
They broke up the days...the years. 
Gave pricks like him a day job.
(refers to Alan)
Maybe early on, I was stupid enough 
to think there was a chance...
(directly to Ron)
Don t play me to get your name in 
the papers.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     23


Ron and Clark look to each other, powerless.



An upset Christine is demanding Clark:

CHRISTINE 
LET ME TALK TO HIM! I can get him 
to change his mind.

CLARK
You re taking the bar in July. 
You re not even allowed to meet 
with him.

CHRISTINE
So you and Ron are just going to 
let this go!?

CLARK
The man s been sitting in a cell 
preparing to die. This is not an 
unusual reaction. Ron wants to give 
it a day or two. 

CHRISTINE
WE CAN T AFFORD A DAY OR TWO!

CLARK
What is it with you? I respect the 
commitment but you re taking this 
personally. If you want to be a 
lawyer, you have to get used to 
knowing what should happen and 
accepting what does. 

CHRISTINE
Bullshit! Maybe that s the kind of 
lawyer you are, Clark. I don t want 
be you!  

Christine exits OS to take action. Clark feels slapped.



THE COURT CLERK, ETHAN (white, nerdy, early 30 s), is on the 
phone at his desk.  

ETHAN (ON PHONE)
... some of the case evidence is 
here, but some of it s in storage 
at the precinct. In 2001, they 
didn t have our computer system, so 
it s going to take a day or two to 
locate where the samples are.

INTERCUT ADAM WALKING INTO THE BUILDING.

ADAM (ON PHONE)
I get it, but we re on a strict 
four week time clock, Ethan, so 
there is some urgency here. Make 
this a priority, OK. Do your best. 

ETHAN
OK Mr. Powell.

ADAM
Call me when you find them.

ETHAN
Will do.



 RUDY MARSALIS, enters; a beefy, ex-Adam s INVESTIGATOR,
 police detectivewho runs the investigative unit for the DA s 
 Adam tosses Rudy the nude police photo of Bankowski. office.
Rudy takes a look, impressed by Bankowski s endowment.

RUDY
Wow. I guess that s why they 
call em the Kielbasa Posse.

ADAM
When we were gathering evidence on 
the Butler murders, who was your 
point man at the precinct?

RUDY
I d have to check. 

ADAM
(refers to police photos)
I want to know if they re real and 
when they were taken. 

Rudy nods, crosses to Adam s office door, closes it to make 
sure their conversation is private.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     26


RUDY
So, are we still a go on the 
Zaleski sting?

ADAM
Yes. Why?

RUDY
I found out how much Zaleski 
donated to your friend Margot 
through various fronts. 5 million. 
She s in a king size bed with this 
guy. You sure you want to go after 
him before her election?

ADAM
The man s using union funds like a 
personal bank account. If Margot s 
accepting donations without doing 
her due diligence - nothing I can 
do about it.

RUDY
You don t want to give her a heads 
up for old times sake? Rumor is she 
wants you to be her running mate.  

ADAM
Is there a rumor I accepted?

Rudy understands something about Adam in that moment. He sits 
before he takes a moment to smile and say:

RUDY
I didn t think Lt. Governor would 
be good enough for you.

Adam gives Rudy a silent look that tells Rudy he s right.



DORA BANKOWSKI; Jared s mother, 55-60, a woman who looks like 
a devoted, loving mother. Her home is warm and comforting. 
Christian icons interspersed with family photos, especially 
of her only son Jared from childhood to adulthood.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     27


Christine sits on the couch as Dora brings over a tray of 
coffee, cookies and cake, sits across from her.

CHRISTINE
No, thank you. Can I help?

DORA
No, I ve got it. You young women. 
Careers. So smart. But you don t 
eat, do you? 

CHRISTINE
Well, it s a busy time.

DORA
(serving her)
It s always a busy time with you 
young women but I have to tell you, 
I admire you all. So wonderful to 
have a...uh, whaddacallit...a 
reason for yourself. Ya know? Not 
that raising a family isn t a 
reason.  It can be God s most 
beautiful reason but ya know, you 
do your job, right or wrong, and 
they leave, right? And then what 
reason do you have? 

CHRISTINE
(taking the coffee)
Thank you. 

 PHOTO of JARED AND HIS EX-WIFE, a Christine sees a WEDDING
sexy white trash girl.

CHRISTINE
I didn t know Jared was married.

DORA
(casually)
Divorced. They weren t together too 
long. She was a tramp. Cookie or 
coffee cake?

CHRISTINE
Nothing, thanks. Have you seen your 
son recently?

DORA
I only see him every last day of 
every month. He doesn t like me to 
come to that uh...you know, where 
they keep the men that are gonna...

Dora can t finish. She focuses on sugar in her coffee.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     28


CHRISTINE
The people I work for saw him.

DORA
Really? Why?

CHRISTINE
We have permission from a judge to 
retest Jared s blood sample for a 
new DNA test.

DORA
Why?

CHRISTINE
To make sure there wasn t a 
mistake.

DORA
After 12 years? What mistake?

CHRISTINE
Well, it may not be anything. But 
we ve already gotten his execution 
date postponed three weeks if he 
agrees to a new DNA test.

DORA
Jared said no?

CHRISTINE
(Nods)
Would you talk to him?

DORA
Oh, no, I couldn t do that. If 
Jared said no, then it s no.

CHRISTINE
But it might mean a delay and if 
we re lucky, maybe even a retrial.

DORA
No. I ve prayed on this many times. 
What God has determined, let no man 
try to undo, or however it goes. 
Jared s made his peace with this. 

CHRISTINE
(getting frustrated)
I don t mean to be rude but if you 
asked God I think he d tell you 
that makes no fucking sense.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     29


DORA
(calmly)
You don t mean to be rude and you 
talk like that in my house?

CHRISTINE
I m sorry. I just don t understand.

DORA
I don t mean to say anything bad 
against you but it s a little 
cruel, don t you think, to give him 
hope after all this time?

CHRISTINE
But if there s a chance....

DORA
(gently)
Let me tell you something - my son 
was heading for this since he was a 
teenager. I was alone raising him. 
I know it s my fault too. I didn t 
want to see what he was. But now, 
after all these  years, he s become 
a better man in prison than he ever 
was out here. He s like a new 
person. Out of this horrible thing 
he did, came a gift from God in a 
way. His redemption.

Christine is side-swiped, dumbfounded. Christine s 
investigative eyes scan Dora s house - moderately expensive 
furniture, modern appliances, big TV set - Christine s mind 
quickly puts the pieces together. 

CHRISTINE
Your original address was in Port 
Richmond. When did you move into 
this big, new house?

Dora s expression barely changes. She s street smart. She 
knows what Christine is implying. She makes a counter move: 

DORA
I m sorry dear but, you re a lawyer 
with - what firm was it?

Stalemate. Christine has met her match. There s more to Dora 
than meets the eye.



WE ARE UNDERNEATH THE LIVING ROOM COUCH, AS IN THE OPENING 
SEQUENCE.  THE NIKE SNEAKERS  IN FRONT OF US BUT MORE BLOOD-
SOAKED THIS TIME.                     untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     30


A STAIN SPREADS ON THE CARPET BELOW ONE SHOE AS IF THE RUG IS 
SOAKING UP THE BLOOD LIKE A SPONGE.  WE HEAR EMILY BUTLER 
ENTERING THROUGH THE BACK KITCHEN DOOR.  THE NIKE-WEARING 
ASSAILANT JUMPS UP AND RUNS TOWARD THE KITCHEN...  WE HEAR 
EMILY SCREAM.

EMILY BUTLER (O.S.)
TERRY!!

THE SECOND ASSAILANT ENTERS OUR POV, RUNNING TO THE KITCHEN. 
THIS TIME; WE CATCH A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF THE MAN S FACE.

IT IS JARED BANKOWSKI.



Jenny Butler opens her eyes - calmly, not with a start. She s 
used to these nightmares. Her calmness is almost eerie. She 
simply sits up, turns on the light to take a sleeping pill 
from a bottle beside her bed. She looks down at her feet.

POV: Her slippers beside her feet, just like when she was 12.



END OF ACT TWO                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     31


ACT THREE



Rodney and Adam speak like two people who can block out the 
world to give each other complete attention. 

RODNEY
I was thinking of moving your 
mother to the Buck s County house 
after her treatments. Maybe stay 
there til Labor Day.

ADAM
I think that would be great. We 
could bring the kids to visit.

RODNEY
If you need me for the Zaleski 
thing, I can come back and forth...

ADAM
No. Nothing for you to do. You go. 

RODNEY
So damn quiet up there. I ve got to 
get used to it. What s happening 
with this Bankowski DNA thing?

ADAM
(surprised)
How do you know about that?

RODNEY
You think I m retired, I m deaf and 
dumb?

ADAM
It s not going to go anywhere.

RODNEY
No it s not. I called my man in 
Rockview. You remember Scurti?                    untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     32


RODNEY
He was on duty when those Innocence 
Project lawyers showed up to get 
Bankowski s blood. Bankowski turned 
them down.

ADAM
Are you sure about that?

RODNEY
This is about the election, listen 
to me. And it s going to backfire.
Governor s an old white man. He s 
got cold feet about executing the 
white murderer of a black family.

ADAM
Nah, I think the Governor is going 
after Margot. I don t think it s 
about color anymore.

RODNEY
It s always about color, son.

Adam recognizes: in that line lies his father s whole life.

RODNEY
Well, if he s looking for a 
shitstorm, Margot ll give him one.

ADAM
(laughs)
She told me to delay the DNA 
samples. You believe that? She 
still thinks I m her wing man. 
Transparent bullshit like that? On 
a case this big...

RODNEY
Shrewd don t mean smart. But shrewd 
survives.
(beat)
Are you going to take her offer for 
Lt. Governor?

ADAM
What do you think?

RODNEY
I think that woman made a career 
out of the work you did. And I 
think it s time that stopped.

Adam smiles. He agrees. Rodney speaks with intense support:                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     33


RODNEY
Nobody s ever gone after Zaleski. 
You pull this off, people are going 
know you re the real star. A black 
man taking on the white Posse. 
That sends a big message. You re 
going go farther than all of us. 

Adam listens like a respectful apprentice. He confides:

ADAM
Sometimes dad - it s going to sound 
strange - but sometimes I see 
what s ahead and I know I can get 
there and...(stops).

RODNEY
And it scares you a little?
(Adam nods)
It s OK.  It s scary, knowing you 
have the power to get what you want 
in this life. But son, there s 
nothing wrong with ambition, with 
desire. That s how great lives are 
started. With a desire. As long as 
you know that what you re going for 
is right, not just for you, but for 
everyone. And making things right 
is never neat. Some people will 
suffer, some people will 
bleed...but it don t have to be 
neat. It just has to be right.

Adam sees Billie in the doorway. She smiles a secret smile.

BILLIE
Dinner s ready you two.



Jared is dressing when a GUARD appears at his cell:

GUARD
You have a visitor.

JARED
My mother?

GUARD
Ex-wife.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     34


Jared is surprised and curious.



Jared is escorted into the prisoners side of the visitors 
room. He is curious to see who is visiting him. He finds:

Christine, dressed up like a white trash ex-wife, playing a 
part; low cut, tight mini, lots of make-up.She s anxious  
about Jared s reaction.

Jared is amused and curious as he sits before on the opposite 
side of the bullet proof glass. The cubicle dividers are 
deep, so there is some privacy from the Guards at the doors, 
but not from the video surveillance.

JARED
Sweetheart. I hardly recognize you.

CHRISTINE
(whispers)
Thanks. My name is...

JARED
Show me your tits.

Beat. Christine hides anger, ignoring his request.

CHRISTINE
My name is Christine Rosa. I work 
for the Innocence Project. Sort of. 
I m an intern. I m taking my bar 
exam next month.

Jared stands. Christine tries to stop him by saying:

CHRISTINE
My father was on Death Row. He was 
executed.

He turns to go when Christine calls out:

CHRISTINE
Wait!

Jared turns back to see; Christine is unbuttoning her blouse. 
Jared can t believe she s doing it. He sits back down. 
Christine slowly unbuttons her blouse as she speaks.

CHRISTINE
Why won t you let them take a new 
blood sample?

Jared just stares. Christine opens her blouse. Beat.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     35


JARED
All I see is a bra.

Christine, pissed off, begins to open her bra from the front.

QUICK CUT TO:



The Guard stares, checking that no one sees him watching.



Jared watches, like a kid at Xmas. But Christine knows she 
has Jared under her control now, so she times the opening of 
her bra with her next statement to get the full effect;

CHRISTINE
I met with your mother.

This changes Jared s attitude immediately. Christine opens 
her bra she is no longer sexy. Now Jared s all business.

JARED
Why!? What did she say to you?

CHRISTINE
I guess foreplay s over.

Christine buttons up her bra and blouse as she continues; 

CHRISTINE
She says it s your decision...
When they arrested you, did you 
remember the police taking photos:

Christine presses Jared s nude police photo to the glass. 
Jared looks confused, listening, a slow burn in him;

CHRISTINE
When they picked you up later that 
night, you were with a...
(reads)
Loretta Strauss. A week later, 
Loretta Strauss disappeared. Like 
she never existed. She s still a 
Missing Person.

Jared betrays no recognition of the name...

CHRISTINE
Before she disappeared, Loretta 
Strauss was arrested on a DUI.                    untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     36


CHRISTINE
Because she had a record, she was 
put in county. Her bail was paid 
for by a man ...
(reads)
...Louie Antonik. 

At the mention of Antonik, Jared looks worried.

CHRISTINE
Antonik was part of the Port 
Richmond Kielbasa Posse. He died of 
an aneurysm six months after 
 Loretta disappeared.Except I can t 
find a coroner s report or death 
certificate anywhere to prove it. 

JARED EXPLODES, hitting the glass, startling Christine;

JARED
GET OUT OF HERE! Stay out of this. 
And stay away from my mother.

GUARD IN ROOM
(OVERLAP SHOUTS)
BANKOWSKI!

Jared regains his cool. Christine is genuinely shaken. 

CHRISTINE
It s a blood sample. It ll take 
less than 20 seconds. 

JARED
What do you care?

CHRISTINE
Something about your case isn t 
what it looks like. And nobody 
believes me. I don t know you at 
all - maybe you re an absolute 
shit. I don t care. And if you want 
to die, that s your right. But I 
don t like it when the Law gets 
manipulated by people who think 
they matter more than other people. 
Like my father. Like you. I hate 
their arrogance. I hate them 
feeling safe. I hate they feel 
entitled to feel safe. I want to 
make them sweat, even if they win. 
Don t you?

Jared, for the first time, likes what he hears. Christine is 
finished. Jared studies her before he replies:                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     37


JARED
Can you guarantee me something?
No matter what happens, you make 
sure my blood is tested.

CHRISTINE
(confused)
Of course. That s why I m -- 

JARED
No, I mean no matter what happens - 
can you guarantee me that?

CHRISTINE
I guarantee the test will happen.

Jared nods. He rises. Christine can t believe he s agreed.

JARED
If you run with this, little girl, 
be prepared to run real fast. 

Jared stands by the door, knocks, The Guard opens it, Jared 
exits. Christine is left alone, exhilarated and unnerved.



From the bullpen filled with busy interns and staffers we 
hear Clark yelling. Everyone stops when they hear:

CLARK (O.S.)
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?... 



Christine has just told Clark of her visit with Jared. Clark 
is in mid-meltdown. Christine is not intimidated:

CLARK
...You could be disbarred before 
you even take the bar!

CHRISTINE
That doesn t even make sense! I got 
it done!

CLARK
You had no legal right to visit 
him! You could put us in serious 
trouble! I should report you before 
I fire you!

CHRISTINE
Fine! Go ahead! Just take his blood 
sample first!

Christine takes her scolding but remains focused on their 
objective. Clark concedes, as he dials the phone;

CLARK
God help the justice system if you 
do pass the bar.

CHRISTINE
(murmurs)
The justice system can eat me.

Clark knows Christine s story. He doesn t respond.

CLARK (ON PHONE)
Adam Powell. Clark Rylance calling.
(to Christine)
Out!

Christine exits.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     39



Adam is at his desk when he picks up. WE INTERCUT ADAM AND 
CLARK S CONVERSATION:

ADAM (ON PHONE)
Clark-bar, how are you?

CLARK (ON PHONE)
Still waiting for your office to 
send the damn blood samples. What s 
the hold up? 

ADAM (ON PHONE)
Don t sound so rattled. The clerk 
had some trouble finding it, that s 
all, but I ll call and push him 
again. Except it s not going to 
matter, Clarkie - Bankowski s going 
down.

CLARK (ON PHONE)
Do you practise sounding like a 
tough prosecutor? What do you do - 
memorize LAW AND ORDER episodes?
(Adam laughs)
I m just doing my job here. I have 
Bankowski s blood and I need your 
samples to make a deadline.

Adam hides his surprise that Bankowski agreed to a new test.

ADAM (ON PHONE) 
Bankowski agreed to the new tests?

CLARK (ON PHONE)
Yeah Adam. Why? Did you hear 
differently?

Adam is momentarily stalled.

ADAM (ON PHONE)
No. Look, we ll get you the samples 
as soon as possible. I promise. We 
should get a drink. Been too long.

CLARK (ON PHONE)
If your paying. Give my love to 
Billie.

ADAM (ON PHONE)
You got it.

Adam hangs up as Rudy enters and closes the door.

Adam s expression tells us when Rudy closes the door, Rudy 
has something serious and private to discuss;                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     40


ADAM
What?

RUDY
I did some backtracking on the DNA 
lab that did our original results.
(Adam listens)
Remember a guy named Dr. Rahbari? 
Ran the crime lab here in Philly, 
before going over to Pittsburgh.
(Adam nods)
Became something of a celebrity DNA 
witness for the Prosecution in 
Pittsburgh. They found seven out 15 
cases he tested had incorrect 
results. 

ADAM
Why didn t this come out before?

RUDY
Our case predated Pittsburgh.
Rahbari made a deal with their DA. 
They took away his license. He had 
his record wiped and a gag order on 
his entire tenure at Veranova Labs. 
Left the country. For all we know 
he could be running a DNA lab in 
Croatia. These roaches never die.

Adam is genuinely disturbed by this information, along with 
Clark s info that Bankowski is allowing a new test.

RUDY
You want me to find Rahbari?

ADAM
(thinking)
Not yet. Rudy, would you just give 
me a minute.

Rudy understands. He exits Adam s office, closing the door. 
Adam dials the courthouse. 

ADAM (ON PHONE)
Ethan, it s Adam Powell. Have you 
found the Bankowski samples?. Well, 
I told you to call me! Listen, send 
them over to Clark Rylance at the 
Innocence Project as soon as we 
hang up. Now, I m going to send 
Sonia down to you. I want 
everything else - trial 
transcripts, depositions, evidence 
list, everything you ve got. 

Adam hangs up. He feels something is not right.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     41



Jared is having a blood sample taken by a Nurse, with Ron 
Fischman and Clark as witnesses, along with Two guards.



Adam is surrounded by the Bankowski trial evidence boxes, 
studying the contents sprawled before him; EVIDENCE FROM TWO 
TRIALS - JARED BANKOWSKI AND TERRY KAMINSKI - INCLUDING 
KNIVES, CLOTHES, FINGER NAILS SAMPLES AND TRANSCRIPTS...

He can t find anything. He stops and stares into space until 
he notices Billie, dressed for bed, standing in his doorway, 
bringing him coffee. 

BILLIE
Did you find anything?

ADAM
No. I don t think there s anything 
to find. He was guilty. I had an 
eye witness. 

BILLIE
But something s still bothering 
you.

ADAM
Yeah. I just don t know what. 
(rubs his face)

BILLIE
Did you talk to your Dad about it?

ADAM
Yeah, why?

BILLIE
Did he get all  black man fighting 
the white system  on you?

ADAM
Baby, please, not tonight. The man 
has a lot of time on his hands, so 
he thinks about me. Why do you have 
such a hard time with him lately?

BILLIE
Because ever since he was forced 
into retirement, he s made you his 
new job. Turning you into the Great 
Black Hope.

ADAM
Oh, that is not true!                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     42


BILLIE
Adam, the man had a lot of power. 
That s not easy for anybody to give 
up. And the only way he s going to 
get that power back is through you. 

ADAM
What the hell are you talking 
about?

BILLIE
He talked you into this Zaleski 
investigation. Why? Because it s a 
career move for you.

ADAM
Nobody talks me into anything! It s 
the right thing to do.

BILLIE
It s changing you.
(Adam surprised)
The way you talk lately. This whole 
Zaleski obsession. Not telling 
Margot about it. What are you 
really going after here, Adam? A 
crime or a headline?

ADAM
There s nothing wrong with both if 
that s the way it plays out.

BILLIE
You and Margot were partners. 

ADAM
Partners? I was her sidekick. You 
know how many press conferences 
Margot gave with information I 
wrote down for her? All of them.
The cases I brought to trial and 
won and never got credit for. 
You want me to stay a DA my whole 
life while people I m smarter than 
go higher and higher? You want me 
to keep making a DA salary while 
you make the money that keeps us 
living like this?

BILLIE
(surprised)
Is that what you think? Honey, I 
invest money for people with money. 
It s a job. It doesn t matter, not 
like yours. And if making more 
money than you to keep all this is 
an issue, I ll quit. I don t need 
this house...                    untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     43


BILLIE
...I only need the people in it. 
And the fact that you don t know 
that - proves what I m saying. 
You re starting to get hungry for 
something I don t understand. And I 
don t like it.

Billie exits but Adam has heard her. 



Jared s original blood sample is handed delivered to the Lab 
Technician in charge of the testing. A tube labeled BANKOWSKI 
is removed from a freezer containing his new sample: 

WE BEGIN TO SHOW THE DETAILED PROCESS OF DNA BLOOD TESTING 
WHICH WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT ACT FIVE.



Adam is working at his desk when Sonia pops in, urgently:

SONIA
You have to see this.

She turns on his LCD Monitor to: JENNY BUTLER GIVING A PRESS 
CONFERENCE.

REPORTER (V.O.)
...Breaking news. The only eye 
witness to the Butler murders of 
2001 has called a press conference. 
She alleges that convicted murderer 
Jared Bankowski s DNA is being re-
tested for political party gain.

Jenny is standing next to her lawyer, reading a statement.

JENNY (ON TV)
 lived in a nightmare since my ....I
father, my mother and my sister 
were taken from me...



Christine, Clark and Ron Fischman are watching as well.                    untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     44


JENNY (ON TV)
 in all those years, Jared ....And
Bankowski s guilt has never been 
questioned....



An angry and surprised Adam watches with Sonia. 

JENNY (ON TV)
Now, in an election year with Jared 
Bankowski s clemency appeal denied 
for the 5th time, suddenly there is 
a reason to re-test his DNA and 
possibly retry him. 

  Nancy Grace-like  TALK SHOW HOST, ELLEN ON LCD MONITOR: A
MCBRIDE talks directly to camera;

ELLEN MCBRIDE (ON TV)
 disgusting that anyone ...It s
would use this tragedy for 
political gain. Clearly they are 
not survivors of violence. Because 
survivors of loved ones brutally 
murdered would want this vile 
monster in front of a firing squad, 
gassed and then hanged before he 
got the humane punishment of lethal 
injection.

WE PRE-LAP:

JUDGE HALL (V.O.)
Who the hell leaked this?



Adam, Clark and Ron are facing Judge Hall s wrath.

RON FISCHMAN
Not our office. It serves no 
purpose. But let s remember Jenny 
Butler was a prosecution witness.

ADAM
(angry)
We can t control Jenny Butler. I 
don t know how she found out, but 
let s remember whose family was 
murdered here.                    untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     45


CLARK
Your honor, because of the DA s two 
day delay in getting us the 
samples, we d like to ask for an 
extension...

Adam looks to Clark, angry. He didn t stall the samples.

JUDGE HALL
(turns on Clark)
And why do you think you have the 
right to ask for anything, 
counselor? I happen to know 
Bankowski didn t even agree to get 
tested. Are we supposed to add days 
because of his delay too? If we 
keep this up, I ll be dead before 
Jared Bankowski ever sees an 
execution date. I m not going to be 
the cause of another 5 billion 
dollars in damages when this city 
explodes over a white man getting 
special treatment for murdering a 
black family. Request denied! You 
either have your results in by the 
date set or you don t. Execution 
stands at May 8th. 

Clark looks to Adam. END ON ADAM. Something s very wrong.



END OF ACT FOUR                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     46


ACT FIVE



Jared sits opposite Clark and Christine behind the glass:

CLARK
...so we have to face the very real 
possibility that the test results 
may not be done in time. I m sorry.

JARED
Yeah but you ll still get them, 
right?

CLARK
Mr. Bankowski, if the results 
aren t in before the date of your --

JARED
I don t care when they re done, you 
just make sure those tests happen 
and that everybody knows.
(to Christine)
And remember what I told you.

CLARK
What was that?

Christine won t answer. Jared is about to exit, then stops:

JARED
One other thing. Make sure my 
mother s at the execution.
(Beat)
Front row.

Clark is beginning to suspect there s more to Jared s story 
than anyone knows. Christine remains silent.



WE INTERCUT VISUALS OF DNA TESTING PROCESS CONTINUING WITH 
OUR CHARACTERS...                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     47



An anxious, distracted Christine is, as usual, the only 
person studying for her bar exam late into the night.  She 
looks up to see: A MALE LAWYER IN AN ARMANI SUIT - late 
twenties, early thirties - enter the library and appear lost. 
He sees Christine crosses to her. She is attracted to him.

ARMANI SUITED LAWYER
Sorry, I ve never used this library 
before and I don t have a lot of 
time. I m looking for Regulation of 
Industry, Trade and Commerce.

CHRISTINE
Occupational law? I think it s over 
here.

ARMANI SUITED LAWYER
Thanks. Sorry to bother you.

CHRISTINE
It s fine. I need a break.

Christine gets up and the Armani Suited Lawyer follows her.



Christine is in the midst of passionate making out with the 
Armani Suited Law Student in a secluded corner, surrounded by 
shelves of law books. They begin to remove each other s 
clothes as they kiss....until Christine, without any 
indication, suddenly puts a stop to it.

CHRISTINE
Wait! Stop. Wait...

ARMANI SUITED LAWYER
What? I...You brought me back here.

CHRISTINE
I know. I know. I m sorry. I can t. 
I shouldn t...I...I m sorry.

Christine pulls herself together and exits quickly.



Christine stealthily walks through the darkened house. 
Everyone is asleep. As she walks, Camera passes by:                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     48

The weekly Powell family dinner with the improvised feel of a 
family who know each other so well. The only difference:

Adam is clearly pre-occupied. Half listening to the others.

From across the table, Billie watches him, knowing what s on 
his mind. Rodney also watches his son, concerned for him.

Darkness. Then Lights go on in the Execution Room, revealing 
the gurney Jared will be strapped on. TWO TECHNICIANS begin 
preparations. Curtains are pulled back to reveal the adjacent 
room where the chemicals and I.V.s are stored.

We Intercut the specifics of setting up I.V. execution room 
throughout the following scenes:

Adam and Billie are in bed watching Rodney giving a speech 
that was recorded earlier in the day.

Rodney Powell, Philadelphia s ex- 
Police Commissioner and founder the 
REACH Foundation, which was honored 
with the city s 2012 Humanitarian

Billie is angry but not surprised at Rodney s incendiary 
comments. Adam is upset. Events are unravelling.



THE DNA TESTING PROCESS CONTINUES....



Adam sits on the left, facing the window into the execution 
room. Christine, Clark and Ron sit on the right. They see:

Jared being led in by the Guards. Jared looks to the 
Execution Visitor s gallery - to the first row  - his mother 
is not there. He is angry. Jared is guided onto the gurney 
and strapped. The Technicians apply an I.V. connected to 
three different drugs.

Suddenly, the Visitor s Gallery door opens and Dora Bankowski 
enters. All heads turn to watch her walk to a seat in the 
front row, in front of Adam, Christine and Clark on the left.

From that moment on, Jared and his mother never let their 
eyes stray from on another. Dora shows no expression. Jared 
stares into her coldly, without sentiment. 

THE WARDEN asks Jared:

THE WARDEN
Is there anything you d like to 
say?

Jared keeps his stony gaze fixed on his mother and shakes his 
head NO. The Warden looks to the technicians and the process 
of the execution begins.



THE DNA PROCESS IS NEARLY AT IT S END AS TIME RUNS OUT.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     51



JARED S EXECUTION BEGINS; Adam, disturbed, sits with a stone 
faced Jenny...Christine is deeply upset, angry, but stoic. 

Jared s eyes stare only at his mother.

JARED S POV: Dora stares back at her son - not saying 
goodbye, not expressing love or empathy - but clear eyed, as 
if this was simply the inevitable next step. 

WE SLOWLY FADE OUT ON DORA, AS JARED DIES...GO TO BLACK.



Adam enters the office, pre-occupied. Employees behavior seem 
to show they know something: a rumor. As soon as he sees 
Sonia expression, he knows something is wrong.

SONIA
Clark s in your office.



Adam enters his office to find Clark waiting for him. Clark 
looks pre-occupied, upset:

ADAM
Hey.

CLARK
Hey. 

ADAM
You want a coffee?

CLARK
Bankowski s DNA came back negative.

Adam uses all his strength to hide how this news affects him.

CLARK
He may have be guilty of something 
but he wasn t the murderer. DNA 
doesn t match Terry Kaminski 
either. If we had half a day more, 
we would have the results. They ll 
be a press conference. I wanted to 
give you a heads up first.

ADAM
Thanks.

CLARK
How did this happen, Adam?                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     52


Devastated, Adam shakes his head. His mind races. 



Terry Kaminski is lead into a visitor s room where he finds 
two people he s never met: Clark Rylance and Christine Rosa. 
Terry looks confused, anxious. He sits before them.

CLARK
Mr. Kaminski, I m Clark Rylance and 
this is Christine Rosa. We know 
you ve written many letters to the 
Innocence Project and received the 
same response. But Ms. Rosa here, 
is responsible for bringing new 
evidence to light...

Christine and Terry exchange a look.

CLARK
We ve filed for a retrial and we 
expect to have you released on 
probation pending a new trial.

Christine watches Terry, stone faced, as his eyes fill with 
tears having finally been heard.

CUT TO:

MONTAGE: we see News Shows about the potential release and 
retrial of Terry Kaminski.

Adam and Billie are watching Adam s statement. Adam mutes the 
TV. He is clearly in crisis. Billie tries to support him.

BILLIE
Look at me. I know what you re 
doing to yourself right now and 
you ve got to stop.                    untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     53


BILLIE
If there was anything wrong with 
that case, you would have killed 
yourself to find it. 

ADAM
I don t know. It was my first big 
case. First time in the papers.

BILLIE
Right, it was your first case. 
You weren t expected to see 
everything, you didn t have the 
experience.

ADAM
That s right. I didn t.
(suspicious)
And I got a death penalty 
conviction. My first time out. I 
shouldn t have been anywhere near 
this case at the time. Everybody 
said I was ready. Everybody said it 
would make my career...Everybody 
was right. 

Billie is getting upset by Adam s re-evaluation and genuine 
distress, though he hides it with a matter-of-fact tone:

ADAM
Maybe I m not changing like you 
said. Maybe I was always hungry...

BILLIE
That s not what I meant. You would 
never do something that went 
against what you believe. Not then 
and not now.

ADAM
Baby, if I didn t see anything 
wrong, it s because I wasn t 
looking.

Billie has no reply.



A florescent light comes on, revealing the corpse of JARED 
BANKOWSKI. A sheet covers him up to the neck.

Adam walks to the body. Alone in the room, he looks down at 
the man he condemned to death for a murder he didn t commit.



A working class home. Neat and clean but modest. Terry takes 
in the home he hasn t seen in 11 years. Ruth passes him as 
she calls for her husband, Terry s Father;

RUTH (O.S.)
Nathan! Nathan, we re home. 

Ruth disappears into the house, calling for Terry s Father. 
Terry stands still. Waiting, knowing his Father s feelings 
towards him until Ruth appears in the doorway, uncomfortable.

RUTH
Maybe he s in the backyard.



On a Black choir, singing their hearts out. We find the 
Powells in the front pew. All are singing along, except for 
Adam, as Camera Moves in slowly to:

innocent man to his death. His mind races.
