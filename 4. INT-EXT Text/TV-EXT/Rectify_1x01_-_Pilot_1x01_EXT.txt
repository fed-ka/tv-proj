      An IMPALA speeds down a rural road, past rows of corn and
      soy beans.  Cows and rotting barns.

      Behind the Impala is a TOYOTA LAND CRUISER followed by a
      HONDA CIVIC.  A caravan of sorts.  Running late and in a
      hurry.  


      Just outside the prison walls, the circus of the PRESS CORP
      is setting up.  TALKING HEADS powdering their faces and
      warming up their mouths.  TECHNICIANS plugging in.  

      Daniel's Lawyer, JON STERN, early thirties, who works for
      the non-profit, JUSTICE ROW, is talking to a PRISON OFFICIAL.                                                                                         5.

                                    JON STERN
                          (to Prison Official)
                    First, I'll introduce Daniel and his
                    family--
                          (Jon's phone rings)
                    Excuse me, for a moment.
                          (answering phone)
                    Where are you?


      Senator Roland Foulkes speaks to the media.  

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Out of respect for the family of
                    Hanna Abbigail Dean, I felt it was
                    my obligation to make a statement
                    here and to make it today.  Almost
                    two decades ago, I prosecuted a case
                    where Miss Dean was brutally raped
                    and murdered.  New DNA testing is
                    not gonna change those facts nor
                    bring her back.  We must remember
                    that Hanna was only sixteen, a child
                    with her whole life in front of her. 
                    And that life was taken in the most
                    heinous manner I have personally
                    ever seen.    

      Jon's still on the phone with Amantha.

                                    JON STERN
                          (on phone)
                    The court of public opinion is in
                    session.

                                      AMANTHA
                          (on phone)
                    Couldn't he just let us have this
                    one day?

                                    JON STERN
                    No.                                                                                          9.


      BELIEVERS of Daniel's innocence and BELIEVERS that he is a
      killer let their voices be heard.

      Jon Stern is leading Daniel's Family through the throng and
      toward the prison entrance.  Amantha is incensed.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Outside observer, my ass.

                                    JON STERN
                    The Senator is just being smart. 
                    Had he said that in your hometown, a
                    change of venue would have been
                    difficult to oppose.  Now he might
                    get to have his cake and eat it too.

                                      AMANTHA
                    And he sure does a fuck of a lot of
                      unofficial commenting.

                                    JON STERN
                    Laying the groundwork to re-indict
                    Daniel before he's even released. 
                    Plus now our press conference will
                    be tainted. 

      She sees the Senator speaking to a REPORTER.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Why don't I just walk over there and
                    kill him right now?  They can take
                    me straight to Death Row.  Skip the
                    middle man. 

      He takes her arm.

                                    JON STERN
                    Amantha, remember everything we do
                    is being watched and judged.                                                                                        11.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Can I at least flip him the bird?

                                    JON STERN
                    No.

      A PRISON OFFICIAL meets them at the Visitors' Gate and lets
      them inside the prison compound.


      Jon Stern stands at a podium set up for the press conference. 
      Daniel stands beside him.  The family is behind them.  Janet 
      is in shock from her emotional outburst earlier.  She has a
      slight, pasted smile on her face.  Amantha holds her hand.                                                                                          13.

      Daniel looks behind him and sees Ted JR who smiles
      uncomfortably.

                                    TED JR
                    Pretty weird, huh?

                                      DANIEL
                    I would say so.

                                    TED JR
                    Hey look.  Sorry I never came for a
                    visit.  It's just... you know.

                                      DANIEL
                    I think I do know, Ted.

      Ted JR feels strangely revealed.  Daniel turns back around
      to the front as Jon Stern addresses the crowd.

                                    JON STERN
                    We are not here to play politics
                    today or to comment on the vulgar
                    theatrics earlier that I am still
                      absolutely agog over.  We are here
                    today because the State presented
                    evidence nearly two decades ago and
                    based on that evidence, Daniel Holden
                    was convicted of murder and sentenced
                    to death.  We are here today because
                    of the perverse miracle that Daniel
                    is still alive and because of the
                    outright fluke that crucial DNA
                    evidence was not thrown away or lost
                    or destroyed.

      During Jon Stern's speech, Daniel notices an OVERWEIGHT MAN
      in his thirties staring at him.  Daniel seems to recognize
      him.  The overweight man turns and walks away. 

                                    JON STERN (CONT'D)
                    We are here because after years of
                    fighting for the right to simply
                    test the DNA to establish if it was
                    Daniel's sperm or not, we finally
                      succeeded.  We are here because that
                    testing conclusively disputes that
                    there was a sole perpetrator or that
                    the sole perpetrator was Daniel Holden
                    as the State had claimed.  And
                    finally, we are here because justice
                    is, at least, temporarily being served
                    and Daniel Holden is going to be a
                    free man for the first time in nearly
                    twenty years.

      The majority of the crowd applauds.  There are some boos,
      too.                                                                                         14.

      Daniel looks up at the open sky, its ceiling so high.  Jon
      Stern gently touches him on the shoulder.  

                                    JON STERN (CONT'D)
                    Daniel?

      How long has Jon Stern been calling him?  Daniel looks at
      the microphone.  He steps forward.  He speaks quietly and
      humbly. 

                                      DANIEL
                    Hello.  Um... I'm not sure what to
                    think of this... drastic change of
                    course in my life.  I'm certainly
                    not against it.  Over the last two
                    decades, I have developed a strict
                    routine that I've followed
                      religiously, you might say.  A series
                    of mental and physical um... habits
                    or exercises that um... well...  A
                    way of living and thinking really,
                    or not thinking as was often the
                    point of the... well, the point.

      So many faces staring at him.  He looks at the ground.  

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    Um... this way of being didn't
                    encourage the contemplation that a
                    day like today could ever occur or a
                    tomorrow like tomorrow will, in fact,
                    be for me now.  I had convinced myself
                    over time that kind of optimism, or
                    what I regarded as fantasy really,
                    served no useful purpose in the world
                    where I existed.  Obviously, that
                    radical belief system was flawed,
                    and was, ironically, a kind of fantasy
                    itself... though it may have been
                    best to experience things that way
                    at the time.  I don't know now.  I
                    just don't know. 

      Daniel thinks about that for a moment and then:

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    At the least, I feel somewhat
                    confident those um... specific coping
                    skills were more suited for the life
                    there behind me.    

      Daniel looks behind him at the prison walls.  So odd to be
      on the outside looking in.  He turns back to all the people
      in front of him.                                                                                        15.

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    And would not serve me so well for
                    the life in front of me.  So I will
                    need to seriously reconsider my world
                    view.

      Daniel starts snickering at the obviousness of his last
      statement.  Almost like an adolescent.  He catches himself
      and quits.  He then falls into a blank stare.  Jon Stern
      whispers into Daniel's ear.

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                          (to Jon)
                    Yes.  Thank-you.
                          (to audience)
                    There are many people to thank.  My
                    mother and sister foremost for their
                    enduring love, devotion, and faith. 
                    All of my family and friends that...
                    I have.  My lawyer, Mr. Stern here
                    for his convictions and doggedness. 
                    Science obviously.  And not the least,
                    luck.  

      He looks to Jon Stern.

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    That's all I have to say.

      Jon Stern steps forward.

                                    JON STERN
                    OK.  A few questions.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      SHOT OF the Impala, Civic and the Land Cruiser driving out
      of the Prison grounds.  FLUME by Bon Iver quietly plays
      underneath as:


      A TV Reporter stands outside the prison.  Intercut with Ted
      JR and Tawney.

                                    TV REPORTER
                    Holden seemed unnerved by all the
                      attention, sometimes losing his train
                    of thought, other times laughing, in
                    what has been characterized, as
                      inappropriate to the situation.   

                                    TED JR
                          (agreeing)
                    It was weird.

      Cut to a clip of Daniel answering questions.  The family is
      seen behind Daniel.

                                    TED JR (CONT'D)
                    There you are.  See?

      Tawney nods.

                                    TED JR (CONT'D)
                    God.  Mom--I mean, Janet freaked
                    out, didn't she?

                                      TAWNEY
                    Sssh.                                                                                        23.

      Ted JR looks at Tawney.  She stays focused on the TV.

                                    TV REPORTER
                          (on TV)
                    Daniel, you don't appear to be very
                    happy at being released. 

                                      DANIEL
                          (on TV)
                    Uh... there is a lot to process right
                    now.  I will probably be happier
                    later.

                                    TV REPORTER
                          (on TV)
                    But aren't you even angry that the
                    state took so much of your life from
                    you?  

                                      DANIEL
                          (on TV)
                    Well...

                                    TV REPORTER
                    If you didn't commit this crime,
                    then how can you not be enraged at
                    the injustice of your incarceration?

                                      DANIEL
                          (on TV)
                    Um... I'm not sure.  Perhaps I will
                    be angrier later as I will be happier.

      He meant that sincerely but some in the crowd laugh.  Daniel
      looks curiously at them.  

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                          (on TV)
                    I hope not at the same time though.

      More laughter. 

                                    TED JR
                    I hate to say this but it was almost
                    like he was playing for laughs
                      sometimes.

                                      TAWNEY
                    I don't think so.  He just sees things
                      differently.

                                    TED JR
                      Seriously, did you understand half
                    of what he said in that speech today? 

                                      TAWNEY
                    A lot of it.                                                                                        24.

                                    TED JR
                    Yeah right.

                                      TAWNEY
                    I did.

                                    TED JR
                    Let's watch something else.  This is
                    giving me the creeps.  

      Ted JR changes the channel.  Tawney looks at Ted JR.

                                    TED JR (CONT'D)
                    Just messing with you.

      He changes back.


                                      AMANTHA
                          (on phone)
                    No, I haven't seen anything tonight
                    but snatches of LORD OF THE RINGS.

      Amantha fumbles in her purse for a cigarette.


      Jon Stern lies on the bed with the TV on and the sound off.

                                    JON STERN
                    Well, ours was the big story of the
                    day especially with the Senator's
                      grandstanding.  

                                      AMANTHA
                          (lighting up)
                    Is it good for us to be the big story
                    of the day or not? 

                                    JON STERN
                    I could argue either side.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Of course.

      Amantha takes a long drag.  She's exhausted.  So is Jon Stern.

                                    JON STERN
                    Nancy Grace called.  Well, her people
                    did.

                                      AMANTHA
                    No.  No way.

                                    JON STERN
                    I know.  Just had to let you know.

                                      AMANTHA
                    You saw him today.  He's... He's
                      overloaded.                                                                                        26.

                                    JON STERN
                    Yeah.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Daniel needs some time alone.  Well
                    not alone but... but not with Nancy
                    Grace either.  God.

                                    JON STERN
                    How is he doing?

                                      AMANTHA
                    Staring at silverware like he hasn't
                    seen any in twenty years.  Staring
                    at his younger brother who he's never
                    seen, staring at me, and at bright
                    shiny things in general.

                                    JON STERN
                    I bet.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Why couldn't Ted Junior be wrongly
                    convicted and spend more than half
                    of his life on death row?  He'd
                    probably come out fine.

      That makes Jon laugh.

                                    JON STERN
                    That might be a little harsh. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    No it's not.

                                    JON STERN
                    I can't imagine you and Ted JR living
                    in the same house as adolescents.

                                      AMANTHA
                    We had to share a bathroom, too.  So
                    gross.

      Makes Jon laugh more.

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    It's not funny.

                                    JON STERN
                    Of course not.

                                      AMANTHA
                    In hindsight maybe but I need therapy
                    just for those three years alone.

                                    JON STERN
                    Post traumatic Ted syndrome.                                                                                        27.

      She starts laughing too.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Yes.  And so under reported.

      It's a nice release for them after today.  The black humor
      and the laughter.  Daniel starts laughing too.  Behind her. 
      In the dark.  It startles Amantha.  

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Oh hey, Daniel.
                          (to Jon)
                    Gotta go.

      She disconnects.  Daniel is still laughing.  

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    I didn't hear you come out, honey.

      He sees she is unnerved.  He stops laughing.

                                      DANIEL
                    I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to... scare
                    you.

                                      AMANTHA
                    No.  It's OK.  You didn't scare me.

                                      DANIEL
                    I wasn't here long...  I just walked
                    out and saw you laughing and it made
                    me laugh.  I'm sorry.

                                      AMANTHA
                    No, it's OK.

      He looks at her with that look of his.  Like he's eating the
      sight of her up.  But she's so frazzled from it all, she
      looks away.

                                      DANIEL
                    You're tired, aren't you?

                                      AMANTHA
                    What?  No.  I'm good.

                                      DANIEL
                    I know you're good. 

      She smiles. 

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    Could you drive me around town?

                                      AMANTHA
                    Now?                                                                                        28.

                                      DANIEL
                    Just for a little while.  I don't
                    think I want to see it in the
                    daylight.  Not at first.  

                                      AMANTHA
                    Oh.  Of course.  Let's tell Mom.


      The town is closed up.  No cars out except Amantha's Civic
      which moves slowly through town.


      The Sheriff follows Amantha.  Not too close but just close
      enough.  Nice and easy.                                                                                        38.


      A red rim lays just behind the live oaks that overhang the
      primordial brown river.  The calm waters creep along as if
      the river itself is just waking.  Morning doves quietly call
      each other.  A fish rolls in the shallows exposing its white
      belly to the sun. 

      We PULL BACK to find Daniel standing on the sand bar of an
      old swimming hole.  A place where generations of kids have
      come to swim and to play.  To be kids.  His back is to us as
      his bare feet dig into the sand.

      The red glow grows to orange as the sun makes its inexorable
      daily rise.

      We are in front of Daniel now.  Pushing in.  His face is
      impassive.  Unreadable.  Unreachable.  As we push in closer
      and closer into his face, the sun breaks.  We can see it. 
      The golden sun rising.  Right there in his eyes.  But the
      spark we see is from the outside.  He remains opaque.


      The Civic is parked a ways back from the swimming hole. 
      Amantha has her seat in recline.  She is asleep with Daniel's
      jacket over her.  The sun hits her face.  She slowly wakes
      up.  Looks beside her.  Daniel's not there. 

                                      DANIEL (O.S.)
                    Good morning.

      Daniel is leaning on the car.  Watching the sun on the river. 
      His back is to her.                                                                                        39.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Good morning.  You like?

                                      DANIEL
                    Yes.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Your first day.  I thought this might
                    be the perfect place.

                                      DANIEL
                    Yes. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    I wanted it to be special for you,
                    honey.

      Pause.

                                      DANIEL
                    It is that.  Lotta um... texture.

      And then: 

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                      Thank-you, Amantha.  For everything. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    You're quite welcome, brother.  Any
                    time.

                                                                                FADE OUT:


                                    TREY WARREN
                    Funny place to have a reunion.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    Not so funny.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    How's Florida?

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    I don't care for it.  

      Trey looks around.  Perplexed.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    Where's your car, Georgie?

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    I took the bus.  Make sure I wasn't
                    being followed.                                                                                        44.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    By who?

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    Now they know what they didn't know.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    Yeah, it's kinda big news around
                    here.

      George looks at Trey.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    Did you kill her, Trey?

      Trey looks straight at George.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    No.  

      And then:

                                    TREY WARREN (CONT'D)
                    Did you, Georgie?  

      George looks away. 

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    No.

      The years haven't been kind to George. 

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK (CONT'D)
                    They're gonna want to talk to us
                    again.  Put us on the stand, I guess.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    Oh yeah.  It's gonna be a real big
                    deal.  Just like before... except
                    they may go after more than one person
                    this time.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    I think about it a lot.  

                                    TREY WARREN
                    That's always been your problem.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    But I get stuff mixed up.  What they
                    told us.  What I remember.  What I
                    think I remember.  I don't know which
                    is which anymore.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    You'd better review then.                                                                                          45.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    We were just kids.  It wasn't real
                    then.  

      Trey is noncommittal.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK (CONT'D)
                    Sometimes I think about what it would
                    be like to talk to him.  You know? 
                    Maybe even go fishing with him.  

                                    TREY WARREN
                    That's not how the world works.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    No.

      George looks at Trey.  Pain in his eyes.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK (CONT'D)
                    What are you gonna do, Trey?

                                    TREY WARREN
                    Tell the truth.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    What is the truth?

      Trey doesn't blink.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    What I said before.  Change now at
                    your own peril. 

      Trey stands there unyielding.  George stands there weighed
      down.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      WIDE SHOT

      The Tundra drives away leaving George standing there all
      alone. 


      Jon talks through his phone ear piece as he packs.

                                    JON STERN
                    It's called "the unindicted co-
                      ejaculator theory".  


      Amantha is on the phone, furtively smoking a cigarette.                                                                                        46.

                                      AMANTHA
                    I'm sorry?

      INTERCUT WITH JON STERN

                                    JON STERN
                    Exactly.  The term was coined by
                      prosecutors trying to get around the
                    Pandora's Box of DNA.  Case in
                      Mississippi right now where a man
                    was freed on bond after fifteen years
                    on death row for a rape and murder
                      conviction when DNA testing showed
                    the sperm wasn't his. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    Hmmm.  Sounds familiar.

                                    JON STERN
                    Actually more cut and dry than our
                    case.  There was only one sperm sample--
                    not the condemned man's.  And yet,
                    he will be retried for that murder.

                                      AMANTHA
                    How thrilling.

      Jon goes to the cheap desk, digs through his papers.

                                    JON STERN
                    The D.A. said: 
                          (reading)
                    "Whether the defendant actually
                      penetrated that child or not,
                      functionally doesn't make any
                      difference if he was aiding,
                      assisting, and encouraging in her
                    death."

                                      AMANTHA
                    That's our ticket out.

                                    JON STERN
                    What is?  

                                      AMANTHA
                      "Encouraging in her death."  Daniel's
                    not a rah-rah kind of fella.

      Jon shakes his head.

                                    JON STERN
                    There are other evidentiary issues
                    I'm more concerned about.                                                                                        47.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Hanna had been Daniel's girlfriend,
                    Jon.  Of course, they found
                      evidentiary shit.

                                    JON STERN
                      I understand but--

                                      AMANTHA
                    What's your point?

                                    JON STERN
                    My point is, there's a hundred
                    different ways prosecution can
                    convince a jury that Daniel was still
                    a part of this no matter what the
                    DNA does or doesn't say.  

                                      AMANTHA
                    That's right.  Because they're in
                    the convincing business, Jon.  That's
                    what they do.  First, they convince
                      themselves, then they convince anybody
                    necessary by any means necessary
                    including sometimes the defendants
                      themselves.  All you have to do, Jon--
                    if it comes down to it--is to convince
                    one out of twelve people on a jury
                    that the prosecutors are full of
                    shit.  

      Amantha sits down.  

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have--

                                    JON STERN
                    No you're right.  I sometimes forget--

                                      AMANTHA
                    What?  That I'm just the sister?

                                    JON STERN
                    No, of course not.  It's just that...
                    I'm coming down tomorrow.

      That stops her momentum. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    Really?  Already?

                                    JON STERN
                          (and then)
                      Rutherford Gaines has lung cancer. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    Yeah, I heard the good news.                                                                                        48.

                                    JON STERN
                    I don't want to regret anything later
                    I could have asked him.

                                      AMANTHA
                    The only thing I regret was that he
                    was Daniel's lawyer in the first
                    place.  Talk about a chicken shit.

                                    JON STERN
                    I think he regrets it now, too.  

                                      AMANTHA
                    "Old man regrets."  Hollow and too
                    fucking late.

      Amantha softens.  A little...

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Anyway, you can be here for Mom's
                    lame Welcome Home Party.

                                    JON STERN
                    Oh now.

                                      AMANTHA
                      Admittedly less lame with you
                      attending.

                                    JON STERN
                    Thanks, I think.

                                      AMANTHA
                          (sincerely)
                    I'm glad you're coming down, Jon. 
                    And real glad you're on our side.

                                    JON STERN
                    Me too, Amantha.


      Jon stands there for a moment after the call.  Then continues
      packing.
