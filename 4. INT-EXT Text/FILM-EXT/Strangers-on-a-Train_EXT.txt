LONG SHOT THE CAPITOL DOME IN THE B.G. AND THE AUTOMOBILE
ENTRANCE TO THE STATION IN THE F.G. LOW CAMERA
Activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers
with luggage, busy redcaps, etcetera.
We FOCUS on a taxi pulling up and stopping, The driver hands
out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis
rackets in cases to a redcap. CAMERA PANS DOWN as the
passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes
and the lower part of his trousers. He is wearing dark
colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently. The
feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of
scene. Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives up
and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of
this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to
be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are
all we see of him. The sport shoes start off in the wake of
the brogues.
As the brogues and the sport shoes emerge to the train
platform, CAMERA PANS them over to the steps of the train.
Typical music shop of a small town, with plate glass windows
and displays of radios, records, sheet music, etc. Activity
of a couple of customers and salespeople inside. Guy comes
along the street and goes into the shop.
Guy is striding along angrily. He comes to the same
intersection and the same cop. The officer makes a friendly
gesture, is if he'd like to talk awhile, but Guy strides
past him without noticing.
Guy comes into the scene, crosses to a row of public telephone
booths, enters one. Inside the telephone booth, he dumps
some loose change on the shelf, sticks a nickel in the
telephone, speaks into it.
GUY
Long distance.
(a pause)
I want Washington, D. C. The number
is Republic 0800. Person to person.
Miss Anne Burton.
Another pause, very long. Guy is very restless. He digs a
cigarette out of his pocket and sticks it in his mouth, then
looks through his pockets for his lighter, doesn't find it.
He looks puzzled, but about that time the operator speaks to
him.
GUY
(continuing)
Right.
Guy picks coins up off the shelf and drops them into the
telephone, then waits. He shifts the receiver and fumbles
in his other jacket pocket, then turns to the phone.
GUY

a moment and then strolls away in the
direction of the town.
He approaches the row of telephone

We see Bruno enter the small booth and start to glance through
the telephone directory.

Suddenly they look up the street. At this very moment the
bus pulls up in front of Bruno's view, cutting off the sight
of his quarry. The bus comes to a stop.

Bruno rises in alarm and moves around toward the end of the
bus so that he shall not lose sight of the girl coming out
of the house.

Bruno turns to follow Miriam, his manner casual. As he takes

we see a merry-go-round in the background. Miriam and the
two boys are aboard and climbing onto horses. As Bruno goes

him. The merry-go-round starts to move slowly round as Bruno
hops on.

from the landing stage and off into the darkness.
Bruno steps into the foreground and gets into the next boat
which floats alongside. He, too, moves away into the
darkness.

As Miriam's boat passes through, she gives another little
glance over shoulder before her boat disappears into the
darkness of the tunnel.
After a brief moment Bruno's boat comes into the picture,
and it, too, goes into the tunnel.
INSIDE THE TUNNEL
We see the silhouettes of the occupants of Miriam's boat on
the wall of the tunnel, lit dimly from the light coming from
the tunnel exit.

steps in back of her and turns
her head toward CAMERA. Her

face. His head moves a bit farther until Miriam's face is
nearly uncovered at the other side of the screen, and we see
her glasses fall off.

Bruno by this time has stopped onto the landing stage, and
in company with the other people, is looking back as if to
see what's wrong on the island. Then he moves away, starting
off of the landing stage. The boatman turns and glances at
Bruno, but quickly returns his attention to the disturbance

SENATOR BURTON and BARBARA BURTON are seated near a desk on
the farthest side of the room. Senator Burton is a
distinguished fifty, a man with great pride in tradition,
his family and his career. Barbara, Anne's younger sister,
is a lively seventeen who loves excitement, says exactly
what she thinks and rarely thinks before she says it.
Superficially, in height and figure, she resembles Miriam.
She also weirs glasses. By her gestures we gather she is
speaking urgently, but softly, to her father, who lifts a
weary hand to quiet her as she looks toward Guy in the

RANDALL
A call for you, Mr. Haines.
They
say it is urgent.
The phone is plugged in to a connection and Guy crosses the
room and picks up the receiver. The Burtons watch him.
GUY
Hello --
Guy and HENNESSY are walking along the street together, CAMERA
MOVING WITH THEM. Their relationship is most friendly. Guy
carries a briefcase. Hennessy is an amiable but not gullible
young man in his early thirties. He knows his job, is well
groomed, well educated, and well liked.
GUY
Well, I suppose I was pretty lucky
to be seeded fifth, really.

HENNESSY
I've never seen the Forest Hillss
tournament before. I'm looking
forward to it.
GUY
(wryly)
Do you mean we'll be going there
together, Hennessy?
HENNESSY
Oh, don't worry. This thing will be
cleared up by that time.
(changes the subject)
Ever thought of turning professional,
Guy?
GUY
I won't have to do that. When I'm
through with tennis. I'll be going
into politics, I hope.
HENNESSY
(aghast)
Politics! It's a good thing for you
I don't report that to the chief.
He turns to light a cigarette. As he does, Guy gives a barely
perceptible start at what he sees offscene.
LONG SHOT JEFFERSON MEMORIAL FROM GUYS VIEWPOINT
The tiny figure of a man is standing at the base of the tall
white column. The figure lifts in arm and waves. Instinct
tells us that this is Bruno. Hennessy is still mumbling his
opinion of politics.

If he knew you were getting into
that rat-race --

Guy turns his back on Bruno's figure and looks frantically
toward to street, wanting to get away.

He hails a taxi which is cruising by, and they start to get
in. Guy directs the driver.
GUY
Pentagon Building, please.
HENNESSY
Oh, no, not there! I always get
lost.
CAMERA is in a low setup, to take in the sign across the
doorway which identifies the gallery. Hennessy stands in
the foreground in front of the building, on duty.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
The street outside the Burton house is lined with cars and
limousines. Various guests are arriving.
MED. SHOT
On the opposite side of the street we see Hennessy, now
wearing his topcoat. He looks bored as he glances across
the street to the house.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
Anne comes out onto the steps and looks around.
She stops
short as she sees:
There are cars lined up outside on the street. One limousine
is pulling up in the center, two figures at the passenger
door. One is climbing in. The other is Guy.

She calls out urgently:
ANNE
Guy!

Guy turns and closes the door.
MEDIUM SHOT FROM ANNE'S VIEWPOINT
The limousine moves off and Guy comes toward her.
MEDIUM SHOT
Anne comes down the steps and intercepts Guy on the sidewalk.
She leads him along a few paces and then stops and faces
him.
CLOSE TWO SHOT
Anne nods off in the direction of the departed Bruno and
speaks in a desperate, low voice.
ANNE
You didn't meet him for the first
time the other day, did you, Guy?
Guy stares at her for a moment.
GUY
You mean when you introduced us at
the club?

ANNE
Yes. Did you notice how he stared
at Barbara that day?
GUY
(awkwardly)
Well, I didn't -- particularly --
ANNE
(breaks in)
He stared at her again tonight --
while his hands were around Mrs.
Cunningham's throat.
Guy looks at Anne with an expression of growing fear and
alarm. She goes on inexorably:
ANNE
What did Miriam look like, Guy.
GUY
(awkwardly)
Well, why do you ask me? You've
seen her pictures in the paper.
ANNE
Go on, I want you to tell me.
GUY
(haltingly)
Well, she was dark, not too tall,
rather pretty --
ANNE
What else?
GUY
What else is there?
ANNE
She wore glasses, didn't she?
GUY
Yes.
ANNE
She looked a lot like Barbara, didn't
she?
Guy suddenly begins to realize what Anne is getting at.
Anne lowers her head, deliberately avoids looking at Guy, as
she asks:

How did you get him to do it, Guy.
GUY
I get him to do it?
ANNE
He killed Miriam, didn't he?
Tell
me, Guy!
GUY
Yes.
(suddenly bursting
out)
He's a maniac. I met him on the
train going to Metcalf. He had a
crazy scheme about exchanging murders.
I do his murder and he do mine.
ANNE
(quietly)
What do you mean -- your murder,
Guy?
GUY
Well, he'd read about me in the paper.
He knew about Miriam -- and about
you. He suggested that
if he got
rid of Miriam for me, I should kill
his father.
ANNE
You must have realized he was talking
a lot of nonsense!
GUY
Of course! I didn't give it another
thought. And now a lunatic wants me
to kill his father.
ANNE
(beginning to believe)
It's too fantastic!
GUY
(grimly)
Yes, isn't it?
ANNE
You mean you've known about Miriam
all this time?

GUY
Since the first night.
He gave me
her glasses.
ANNE
Why didn't you call the police?
GUY
(bitterly)
And have them say what you did --
"Mr. Haines, how did you get him to
do it?" And Bruno would say we'd
planed it together.
ANNE
Oh, Guy -- what can we do?
GUY
I don't know, Anne...I don't know.
ANNE
(With an anxious look
across the street)
Guy, hadn't we better go inside?
Your friend Hennessy's watching us.
(she Shudders)
GUY
(sadly)
You see, Anne, that's why I didn't
want you to know anything about this.
I wanted to protect all of you --
your father, Barbara. And now that
you know, you're acting guilty, too.
ANNE
(desperately)
Oh, if we could only talk to father
or someone about it.
GUY
No, that's no good, Anne. I mustn't
drag anyone else into this mess.
Come on. Let's go in.
They go toward the house.

sleuth.
HENNESSY

Hello, Hammond.
HAMMOND
You look worried. What's the matter?
HENNESSY
You'd better keep on your toes.
Something funny's going on.

Guy comes out of the window onto the second floor fire escape.
He creeps stealthily down and emerges into a narrow alleyway.
He steps back into the shadows for a moment when he sees:

Guy turns away and is soon lost in the darkness of the street.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
We are on the inside of the gates. We see them swing open
slightly and the figure of Guy edges through them.
CLOSE SHOT
Guy leaves the gates ajar and then, taking the plan of Bruno's
house from his pocket, and the key, he looks toward the house.
This is a long flight of steps. Moonlit. They are lined
with tall black cypress trees which throw their shadows across
the steps. Guy moves out of one shadow, into another and
carefully starts up the stairs.
AT THE DOOR
He pauses, looks about for a moment and listens. Then he
puts the key into the lock, finding it with his flashlight.
The door opens a few inches. He turns off the flash, and
enters.
CLOSE SHOT HENNESSY AND HAMMOND MORNING
Hennessy is relieving Hammond who has kept watch on Guy's
apartment night.
HAMMOND
(in the middle of his
story)
He came back at three twenty-five.
I didn't even know he'd given me the
slip until his 'phone kept ringing
for about half an hour. Nobody sleeps
that sound. So I got the janitor to
let me in. No Haines.
HENNESSY
(to himself)
Wonder where he went?
HAMMOND
We'll probably hear of another dame
murdered.
HENNESSY
(puzzled)
Shut up. I'd better contact Metcalf.
I should think this calls for more
questioning of Mr. Haines.
HAMMOND
Questioning?
Nuts!
Let's take him
in.
HENNESSY
My dear Mr. Hamond, how many times
do I have to tell you that we have
nothing conclusive on Haines? There's
no evidence that he was ever at the
scene of the crime. Can't you get
that into your thick head?
(quietly)
Now stay put till I get back.
As he starts away --

GUY

I was afraid you wouldn't get here.

then gives Anne his full attention.
ANNE
He acted peculiar -- as if he could
put the murder right in your lap,
and not involve himself at all.
GUY
(shaking his head)
He'd drag himself into it, -- and
Bruno loves Bruno. I'm all right so
long as he thinks I have an alibi
for that night.

look on Anne is face)
He knows?
Anne nods slowly.

Then he'll think of something.
He
said he would.

could trace to you --

Any little thing.
GUY

he could have left it on the islands
as evidence

But he wouldn't do that. Not in

While Anne is frantically trying to remember, Guy turns
toward, the stadium and gives a signal of "Be right there."

Something about the moon -- he said
he had an appointment with the moon.
Guy's shoulders droop with disappointment.
GUY
That's no help. But I can't take
any chances. I've got to get that
lighter -- somehow.
REYNOLDS, Guy's opponent, ENTERS SCENE behind Guy's chair.
REYNOLDS
Okay, Guy.
We're on.
He walks away.
Anne and Guy rise, following him.

Guy gives him a thank-you nod. Hammond rolls his eyes in
disgust at Hennessy's politeness.

their eyes hold, in mutual helplessness, Guy suddenly stares
at her with realization.

Anne looks puzzled as Guy looks up at the sun, then at his
watch.
