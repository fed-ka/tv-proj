MR. GILBERT, a bored-looking 30-something, leads WILL out of 
the front office and into the hallway of students. The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   2.


WILL V.O.
See, the thing about being a 
teenager is that your social 
standing can be determined by one 
moment.  One choice.  And though 
sometimes that choice is your own...

Will nods hello to a pretty girl, who smiles back-- but Mr. 
Gilbert quickly drags him past her.

WILL V.O. (CONT D)

Mr. Gilbert stops at SIMON, at his locker with JAY and NEIL.  

MR. GILBERT
Simon, this is Will Mackenzie.  He 
just transferred from a private 
 been carefully school, and you ve
selected to show him around.

SIMON
What?  Why me?

MR. GILBERT
You were standing closest to the 
door.

Simon looks at the administration office door, groaning, as 
Jay and Neil take in Will with an amused chuckle. 

JAY
Is that a briefcase?

WILL

Neil snorts out a dopey laugh.

Will spots a group of handsome jocks nearby and looks 
pleadingly at Mr. Gilbert:The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   3.


WILL

SIMON
(to Mr. Gilbert)
Why do I have to show him around?  
Nobody showed me around.

MR. GILBERT
Because Will suffered from bullying 
issues at his last school.  

WILL
What?  No.  No, I didn t.

MR. GILBERT
 nothing to be ashamed of--It s

WILL
Sorry, but it is, kinda.  And I 
  Sooo...wasn t.

MR. GILBERT
Did they pick on you because your 
dad left your mom for a prostitute?

Will glares at him for a beat.

WILL
 They didn tknow that at my last 
school.

MR. GILBERT
Oh.  Well, you ve got a fresh start 
now.  Good luck.

 delighted ogle.He crosses away.  Will avoids the gang s


WILL, looking beat, enters to see row of toilet stalls with 
no doors.  He sighs... 

WILL V.O.
...Especially the toilets.  Which 
have no doors on them to discourage 
drug use.  This also, curiously 
enough, discourages shitting.  

Will enters a stall, noticing the urine-soaked floor.  He 
delicately hangs his windbreaker across the stall opening.

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
But at least I got to spend some 
more time with my new friends...

JAY, SIMON and NEIL enter.

JAY
I m telling you, I spent the entire 
 the Summer porking vag.  That s
upside of your parents dragging you 
to a bunch of RV parks.  The girls 
there all have one thing in common.

Jay pauses, considering.

NEIL

to get off.

enough crabs off my jock to know 
how many sluts I ve--

A group of GOOD-LOOKING SENIORS walks in.  Jay immediately 
clams up and starts washing his hands.  

WILL V.O.
...And as much as I wished I didn t 
fit in with these idiots...

Will s windbreaker detaches from the stall opening and falls 
to the urine-soaked floor.  He looks down at it, then up at 
the bathroom full of guys now staring at him as he squats six 
inches above the toilet-paper covered seat.  The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   7.


WILL V.O. (CONT D)

He gives them a sheepish wave.

CUT TO:


The guys sit with their lunches.  SIMON, NEIL and JAY with 
school trays and WILL with a series of meticulously packed 
tupperware containers.  He unfolds a linen napkin and puts it 
in his lap.

JAY

WILL
What?  Good manners cost nothing.

JAY
Good snatch costs nothing.  Unless 
your dad s around.  

WILL

Simon nods, humbled, and smiles back at Carly.

CARLY
Hey, do you have Mrs. Weaver for 
economics?

class.

CARLY

She leans in close to take a sniff... giving him a peek down 
her unbuttoned blouse.  He swallows hard.

SIMON
It s kind of an all over body spray.

CARLY
 nice.  See ya in economics?It s

He nods, crossing his legs and squirming a bit as she crosses 
away.  Jay stares at him in disbelief.

JAY

his sandwich with a knife and fork and delicately eats it.

WILL V.O.
And, if there was one upside to 
being trapped in this hellhole of an 
institution, it was finding a group 
of friends that would make anyone 
feel better about themselves.  

Will leans over to Simon:

Have you tried thinking about 
something unsexy?  Like dead nuns?

Simon concentrates for a beat, then cringes.

He chugs far, far too much of it, grabs a brownie, then chugs 
some more.  This is clearly not a great package.

He turns in the direction of the sink and PROJECTILE VOMITS

He waves goodbye to the guys and heads into a CLASSROOM, 
smiling at an ATTRACTIVE GIRL as he passes.  She smiles back.

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
Who knows?  I might even get laid. 

He has a seat in an empty desk, feeling good about himself, 
as the morning announcements start from the PA SPEAKER:

MR. GILBERT (O.S.)
(from PA)
Morning students.  First, I want to 
 had a formal announce that we ve
suit filed by the mother of William 
Mackenzie, regarding his treatment 
by the student body.  

Will looks up, the color draining from his face.

MR. GILBERT (O.S.) (CONT D)
(from PA)
Any student caught bullying him, or 
causing him any emotional or 
physical distress, will be severely 
disciplined by the school and 
possibly outside law enforcement.  
Will is a good boy, with a great big 
heart, and he deserves your respect.

The students all turn and giggle at Will, who is mortified.
