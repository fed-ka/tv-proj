          Johnny and Bruce are hot and crabby.  Johnny sighs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This traffic is crazy.

                                        BRUCE
                        We could be at the blues festival
                        in Rockland by now.  At least
                        it's at a five-star resort.  You
                        sure Reverend Purdy doesn't mind
                        me taggin' along?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, we're friends.  Compadres. 
                          Wherever I go, you go.

                                        BRUCE
                        You didn't tell him I was coming,
                        did you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not a word.
                                (re. the traffic)
                        Not that it's going to matter
                        seeing how we're going to spend
                        the entire weekend sitting in the
                        car.

          Bruce scans through the radio...

                        installed.

          He scans some stations, then we hear a familiar voice.

                                        PURDY (RADIO)
                        Fellow worshipers, join with me

                        Wait... leave it there.

          Purdy CONTINUES preaching in the BACKGROUND (TO BE WRITTEN)

                                        BRUCE
                        Is that Purdy preaching?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Satellite radio must have picked
                        up the new Faith Heritage Channel.

                                        BRUCE
                        The Faith Heritage Channel?  Why
                        does that sound so scary?

          Johnny makes a turn.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Finally...



          Bruce and Johnny are standing behind another couple of
          RICH TOURISTS checking in.

                                        BRUCE
                        How do you explain a vision of
                        Greg Stillson asking you for help? 

                                        JOHNNY
                          I can't, but I saw it happen.

                                        BRUCE
                        Last time you two hooked up, he
                        accused you of murder.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your point?

                                        BRUCE
                        I think you should stay away from
                        the guy.  He's nothing but trouble.

          Johnny and Bruce step up to the front desk. 

                                        CLERK
                        Good day.  Are you gentlemen here
                        for the golf tournament?

                                        BRUCE
                        I look like Tiger Woods?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're here for the Faith Heritage

                        If you'll sign the register. 
                        Excuse me.

          As the Clerk turns away to answer the phone, Johnny goes
          to sign the register and WHOOSH--

          Quick flashes of people signing the register. 

          Flashes stop on Greg Stillson and Miranda.

          Vision Johnny  walks around them, examining them--but

                        Let me guess.  Married?  Underage?

                        This one seems different...

  99RESUME

          Johnny flashes out of the vision, and turns to see Purdy
          behind him.



          Johnny, Bruce and Purdy are sitting at a table.

                                        PURDY
                        Bruce, this is an unexpected
                          surprise.  I didn't realize you
                        were a boating enthusiast.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm not.  We were supposed to go
                        to a blues festival.

                                        PURDY
                        Well, the foundation sincerely
                          appreciates your musical sacrifice.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Speaking of the foundation,
                          congratulations on the new Faith
                          Heritage Network.

                                        PURDY
                        God continues to show his
                        blessings.  Thanks to modern
                          communication technology I'm now
                        able to bring the Word to millions
                        around the globe.

                        That must cost serious money.

                                        PURDY
                        Like most things in this life,
                        it's all about whom you know.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Does that include Greg Stillson?

                                        PURDY
                          Congressman Stillson has been
                        very supportive.  I understand
                        your feeling towards him, but
                        he's a changed man since his
                          father's tragic passing.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Changed?

                                        PURDY
                        More focused and settled.  The
                        rumor mill has him about to secure
                        the hand of his beloved.

                                        BRUCE
                        Stillson's getting married?

                                        PURDY
                        So they say.  I've actually had
                        the pleasure of meeting the young
                        lady.  Miranda Ellis. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        As in Senator Harlan Ellis?

                                        PURDY
                        His only child.  The Ellises are
                        one of Maine's oldest families.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And a quantum leap up the social
                        ladder for somebody like Stillson.

          Purdy freezes as his eyes fall on a dark-suited figure --
          MALCOLM JANUS-- in the distance.  Johnny TURNS to look,
          but Janus is already gone.

                                        PURDY
                        Perhaps we'll have more time to
                        talk later.  Gentlemen.

          As Purdy leaves, the WAITER comes back with the check.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "SAVED" - ONE - 3/28/05 - PINK              8.

                                        BRUCE
                        I know Purdy's got the body
                          temperature of a shark, but did
                        he seem a little nervous to you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now that you mention it...

          As the Waiter hands Johnny the check, Johnny touches the
          leather check holder,



          Greg and Miranda laughing, heads close, at the end of a
          romantic dinner.  Greg is handing the check to the very
          same Waiter.  Vision Johnny closely observes Greg and
          Miranda.

                                        STILLSON
                                (playful)
                        Come on, tell me?  Who took you
                        to the prom?

                                        MIRANDA
                        No...

                                        STILLSON
                          A Rockefeller, I bet.  Or a
                          Kennedy?

          A beat, then...

                                        MIRANDA
                          I didn't go to my prom.  My father
                          wouldn't allow it. 

          Stillson seems genuinely moved... 

                                        STILLSON
                        I had a daddy like that.  Nearly
                        suffocated underneath him.

          Greg gently lifts her chin with his hand.

                                        STILLSON
                        If you were mine, I'd never deny
                        your happiness.  Not ever.



          Out of vision, Johnny turns to Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Even a blind squirrel finds a
                        nut.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If he's going to come to me for
                        help, I'll feel better if I know
                        why.  Let's take a look around.

                          According to the initial report,
                          Congressman Stillson was the only
                        one found onboard.  He's being

                        If she's alive, we'll find her
                          someplace in this area.

                        Depends on the person.

          He walks away, leaving them to ponder the situation...



          Johnny is changing his shirt while watching NEWS COVERAGE
          of the story.  There's an urgent KNOCK on his door.  Then
          another KNOCK.

                          Alright, keep your socks on.

          Johnny MOVES to the door, and OPENS it expecting Bruce...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I thought you said twenty...

          He's stunned to find a hollow-eyed Greg Stillson, just
          like in his first vision...

                                        STILLSON
                        Smith.  You have to listen to me. 
                        You re the only one who can help.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                              ACT TWO

          FADE IN:


          It s a tense moment.  Two enemies, face-to-face.  Stillson
          glances around nervously, a gym bag slung over his
          shoulder...

                                        STILLSON
                        Did you hear what I said?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I heard you.  I just don't believe
                        you.

                                        STILLSON
                        Look, it's probably not good for
                        either of us if I'm seen standing
                        outside your room.

          Johnny reluctantly lets him in.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was just heading out.

                                        STILLSON
                        I need to know if she s dead or
                        alive.

          Stillson pulls a woman's sweater from the gym bag.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is that?

                                        STILLSON
                          Miranda's sweater.  She's my...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know who she is.

                                        STILLSON
                        I want you to touch it.  Tell me
                        what happened to her.

          They lock eyes.  Johnny's gaze strays to the sweater,
          then he looks away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't help you.

                                        STILLSON
                        Look, I know what you're thinking. 
                        Am I involved in her disappearance? 
                        The answer is no.  I swear.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "SAVED" - TWO - 4/5/05 - PINK-2            16.


    23CONTINUED:23

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, if you swear it must be
                        true.  

          Johnny steps up close to Stillson in a threatening posture.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think you should go now.

                                        STILLSON
                        Listen, I know there's bad blood
                        between us--

          Johnny flares, grabs Stillson by the front of his jacket.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bad blood?!  Is that what you
                        call what happened to Rachel? 
                        And what about Rebecca?!  What
                        about all the pain and misery
                        you've rained down on everybody
                        around you!  What about that!?

          Stillson struggles, but Johnny has him tight.

                                        STILLSON
                                  (passionately)
                        I love Miranda.  She has nothing
                        to do with any of that.  Have I
                        screwed up?  Yes.  But this isn't
                        about me.

          Johnny lets go of Stillson, eyes him for a beat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What happened out there on the
                        water?

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm not sure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need to do better than that.

                                        STILLSON
                        We were sailing.  I felt sick, so
                        I went below.  When I came up,
                        Miranda was gone.
                                (voice catches)
                          I looked everywhere, but I couldn't
                        find her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That doesn't make sense.

          Johnny heads for the door.

                                        JOHNNY
                        In fact, none of this makes any
                        sense.

          He opens the door.

                                        STILLSON
                        I know you.  You can't walk away
                        from this.  You can't leave an
                          innocent girl out there alone to
                        die.

          Johnny stops, Stillson sees he's gotten to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why should I believe any of this?

                                        STILLSON
                        Because I'm here.  Because I
                          swallowed every ounce of pride
                        and ego I have left and knocked
                        on your Goddamn door.

          Johnny considers the moment, then releases his hold on
            Stillson.  He steps over and picks up the sweater off the
          bed... WHOOSH!


    2424UNDERWATER - VISION

          It s just a FLASH:  Miranda s face under water, eyes open. 
          She's struggling, then drifts down out of sight...


  2525RESUME JOHNNY

          He flashes out as he looks to an expectant Stillson:

                                        STILLSON
                        You saw her, didn't you?

          Johnny is emotionally torn, but he's also a man with a
          God given gift, a gift he can't refuse an innocent
            person... even one unlucky enough to cross paths with
          somebody like Greg Stillson.

    25CONTINUED:25

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don t know if she s dead or
                        alive.  But maybe I can help find
                        out.

          Stillson seems genuinely relieved.

                                        STILLSON
                        Thank you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let's get something straight. 
                        I'm not doing this for you.  I'm
                        doing it in spite of you.  I'm
                        doing it because if I didn't, it
                        would make us the same.  And we
                        are not the same.  We will never
                        be the same.

          Stillson considers the statement, then offers Johnny his
          hand... Johnny hesitates, then grasps it and... nothing
          happens.  Johnny's visibly thrown by the moment...

                                        STILLSON
                        What's wrong?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing.  I'll meet you down at
                        the marina in ten minutes.

          Stillson heads for the door...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Stillson?

          Stillson turns...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I find out you're involved in
                        this and you're going down.

                                        STILLSON
                        Ten minutes.

          Stillson EXITS.  Johnny ponders the weight of his decision.



          Bruce has just heard about Stillson's visit.

                                        BRUCE

                        There it is.  Just walk away and
                          everything's good.

          Bruce can see it's not that simple.

                        But you can't just walk away, can

                        on that.  But this girl is...
                        different.  I don't think she's
                        seen who he really is.

          It's indoors, but not clear where-- Stillson and Miranda.

                                        STILLSON
                                (intense and drunk)
                        You want to see me?  You want to

          Lights off, Greg lets Johnny in through some French doors
          in the back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She gave you your own key?

                        That's right.  And you might find
                        some of my boxer shorts in her
                          underwear drawer, if you look
                        carefully.

          Johnny looks around the apartment.  Shabby chic, cozy,
            feminine.  Sports trophies, pictures of dogs and horses
          and sailboats.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Anything seem unusual in here?

                        Besides you and me creeping around
                        in the dark?

          Johnny notices more photos of Miranda with her dog, her
          cat and her horse.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Miranda seems to be closer to
                        animals than people.

          Stillson notices the photos.

                                        STILLSON

                        Must be a lot of pressure being
                        the only child of a powerful man.

          PHOTOS of Miranda in competitions, and on the sailboat. 
          Miranda was, in fact, a champion high school swimmer.

                        has a very impressive resume.

                                        MR. ELLIS
                        I'd consult a voodoo doctor, if I
                        thought it'd bring my baby girl
                        home.  I'm just afraid it might
                        be too late for that.

                        Oh.  Right...



          It's the middle of the night.  Miranda wakes up and reaches
          over to an empty pillow.  She gets up, moves sleepily out
          to the living room.



          Greg's sitting in the dark.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Greg?  Why are you sitting in the
                        dark? 

          No answer.  As he takes another gulp of scotch.   She
          turns on the light.

                                        STILLSON
                        Leave it off.

          She turns it off. 

                                        MIRANDA
                        Are you okay?

          He doesn't answer.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Greg, what's the matter?

                                        STILLSON
                                (tight)
                        Can't a man have a drink?

                                        MIRANDA
                        Looks more like a bottle.

                                        STILLSON
                        Twelve steps: step one, you're
                        dating a drunk.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I'm not having this conversation
                        in the dark.

          She goes to turn on the lamp, again.

                                        STILLSON
                        I said, leave it off!

                        I can barely see you.

                                        STILLSON
                                (drunk, intense)
                        You want to see me?  You want to
                        know who I really am?!  Take a
                        look!  Take a real good look! 

          He grabs her forcefully, the moonlight now cutting across
          their faces, like part of each of them is still in the
          dark.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Greg, stop--you're hurting me.

                                        STILLSON
                        Didn't anybody tell you, darlin'? 
                        Love hurts.

          Their eyes lock.  Then he starts to cry.  He lets her go
          and slumps into a chair.

          Street light streams through the curtains, illuminating
          the pain in his eyes.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm sorry. 

          Never having seen Greg like this, Miranda moves around
          him cautiously.  He's in shadow.

                                        MIRANDA
                        You've had too much to drink.  I
                        don't know why you need this stuff? 
                        It only makes things worse.

          She takes a blanket and covers his bare shoulders.  He
          touches her hand and looks up, his eyes filled with tears.

                                        STILLSON
                        No one knows me like you do.  No
                        one but... my father.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Oh, baby, I'm sorry.  Losing him
                        must have been so hard for you.

                                        STILLSON
                        That's just it.  I didn't lose
                        him... I killed him. 

          ON MIRANDA, startled.

                                        MIRANDA
                        What?

          Stillson rises and holds her close. 

                                        STILLSON
                        "The devil that deceived them was
                        cast into the lake of fire and
                          brimstone... and shall be tormented
                        day and night for ever and ever."

          He pulls Miranda to him tight and in an almost whispered
            threat...

                                        STILLSON
                        We're in this together now --

          ON MIRANDA'S FACE, OVER STILLSON'S SHOULDER, FROZEN IN
          FEAR



          He puts the key in the ignition.

                        Why are you doing this?

          Johnny stops, turns to look at her.

                        What?

                        I'm doing this in spite of you. 
                        Because if I didn't, it would
                        make us the same.  And we are not
                        the same.  We will never be the
                        same.

          RESUME SCENE

          Johnny knows exactly why he's doing this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess I decided I couldn't live
                        with the alternative.

          As Johnny starts the car, then drives them away into the
          night.



          Johnny sits in a chair keeping protective watch over
          Miranda as she sleeps in the bed across from him.

          ON JOHNNY, staring at Miranda, hair fanned out on the
          pillow.  We see he's not immune to her beauty or her
            helplessness, but it feels deeper than that.  He reaches
          down rubs the top of his hand, the hand she touched in
          the car.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:



          Johnny's asleep in the chair.  A razor thin beam of
          sunlight blasts through a tiny break in the curtains and
          across Johnny's face.  He startles awake to see the bed
          EMPTY.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Miranda?

          He jumps up and checks the door, then hurries across the
          room and throws open the bathroom door.          DEAD ZONE: "SAVED" - THREE - 3/29/05 - YELLOW         40.



          Miranda is just out of the shower, a towel wrapped around
          her body.  It's a bit awkward --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.  I thought... Sorry.

          He EXITS, closing the door behind him.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                          Terrific.



          Miranda is now dressed as Johnny glances out the window.

                                        MIRANDA
                        What time is it?

                        Nearly seven.

          She hands him the cup of coffee.

                                        MIRANDA
                        It's instant.  So's the heartburn,
                        I'm afraid.

                                        JOHNNY

          Awkward beat, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you mind if I ask you a personal
                          question?

                                        MIRANDA
                        Why Greg Stillson?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It doesn't seem to fit... the two
                        of you.

                        My father has always been very

                        Greg was different than the guys
                        I've known.  There was a sense of
                        danger about him.  I thought it
                        was part of his personality, I
                        never imagined it would turn out
                        to be so real.

                        You father seems to be taken with

                        track to the White House.

          Johnny considers the implications of that possibility...

                                        MIRANDA
                        You never told me how you and
                        Greg know each other?

                        It's a long story.

          She steps up close to Johnny and gently touches his face.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I can tell that you've suffered. 
                        That you've lost someone.  Does
                        it have anything to do with him?

          It's a shared moment, a bond of pain and regret.  Less
          sexual, than survival...

                        John, are you crazy?  You remember
                        the last time you and Stillson
                        ended up in Washington?

                        This is different.  Did you get
                        the coroner's report?

                        James Stillson's death is listed
                        as an accident.  He was drinking
                        and he fell.  Autopsy showed trauma
                        to his neck and throat which was
                        consistent with witness statements.

                        I'm almost sure that's not the
                        way it happened.

                        You're still going to need another

                          confession.

          Johnny looks over at Miranda.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm working on it.  I'll call you

          Stillson is in his office, blinds closed, drinking.

                                        JANUS O.C.
                        That isn't going to help.

          Stillson turns to see Janus, as if he's appeared out of
          thin air.

                                        STILLSON
                        It isn't gonna hurt.

                                        JANUS
                                (to Stillson)
                        Pour it out.

          Stillson looks at Janus...

                                        STILLSON
                        What?

                        Pour it out... now.

          Stillson considers the solemn face of Janus confronting
          him, then pours the drink into a nearby plant.

                                        STILLSON
                        Happy?

          He steps to the window and peers through the blinds.

                                        STILLSON
                        Look at 'em out there.  Like a
                        pack of jackals.  They're calling
                        it another Chappaquiddick.

          Stillson turns...

                                        STILLSON
                        Did you have something to do with
                        this?

          Janus calmly pours himself a drink, a not-so-subtle gesture
          of power and control.

                                        JANUS
                          I assure you, if I'd wanted Miranda
                        Ellis dead, we would not be having
                        this conversation.
                                (beat)
                        But she isn't dead.  She's very
                        much alive.

          Stillson can't believe what he's hearing.

                                        STILLSON
                        Alive? 

                                        JANUS
                        Johnny Smith didn't tell you?

                                        STILLSON
                        You've been following me?

                                        JANUS
                        There isn't a part of your life
                        I'm not interested in.  The thing
                        you need to ask yourself is, why
                        would the love of your life go to
                        such measures to convince the
                        world she was dead?

          It's one bombshell after another for Stillson.

                                        STILLSON
                        Miranda set this whole thing up?

                                        JANUS

                                        STILLSON
                        I don't understand.

                                        JANUS
                        I think you do.

          They both know what he's talking about.  Stillson breaks...

                        And now the one person in the
                        world that knows the truth is
                        with Johnny Smith in Washington
                          checking into the Hotel Gerard. 
                        I find that interestingly ironic,
                        don't you?

                                        STILLSON

                        Smith and Miranda?  Sonofabitch!

            Stillson, enraged, starts for the door.

                        Do not open that door.

          Stillson stops, his hand on the door knob.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm going to kill him.

          Janus steps to him and rests his hand on Stillson's
            shoulder.

                                        JANUS

                        hours.  And the answer is simple...
                        Faith.  Faith in myself, in my
                        team and, most importantly, in my
                        God.  I want to thank everyone
                        for their prayers.  I'm not sure
                        I would have made it without them.

          He looks up quickly... What did he just say?


          RESUME STILLSON

          He breaks a smile for the first time...

                                        STILLSON O.C.
                        I'm here to announce that our
                        prayers have been answered.  
                                (to an AIDE)
                        We ready?

          Crowd clears to REVEAL Miranda, being ushered out by her
          father, smiling to the APPLAUDING CROWD.  AD LIB REPORTERS
          yelling her name.  As FLASHBULBS POP, SLO-MO Miranda,
          deer in the headlights, assaulted by the attention.

          Johnny can hardly believe what he's seeing as he glances
          over at Bruce and Purdy.

                                        STILLSON
                        Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
                          introduce you to the true hero of
                        this story.  The love of my life,
                        Miranda Ellis.

          Miranda gets a kiss from Stillson as she steps awkwardly
          to the podium.  FLASHES POPPING OFF IN HER EYES, as she
          seems more fragile and alone than ever.

                                        MIRANDA
                                (into microphone)
                        It's good to be alive.

          More APPLAUSE.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I'm not going to get into details. 
                        I'd just like to say thank you to
                          everyone involved.  But mostly to
                        the one person who made this
                          possible...

          In the audience, her eyes suddenly land on Johnny... she
          hesitates, too shook up to speak... then she steadies
          herself... Stillson notices the brief connection.

                                        MIRANDA
                                (emotional beat, then)
                        He's my own personal hero... 
                        Greg Stillson.
                                (turns to Greg)
                        Through this experience, I have
                        come to know who you really are...

          More applause as he puts his arm around her.

                                        MIRANDA
                        When everyone told you it was
                          hopeless, you wouldn't give up. 
                        And I felt that... that love every
                        second that I was lost.

                        Miranda was picked up by a private
                        fishing boat.  An ordinary citizen
                        who was there when she needed
                        help.

                          Miranda, what exactly do you
                          remember about the accident?

          She trades a momentary look with Stillson, then...

                                        MIRANDA
                        It's still a little sketchy. 
                        There was a strong gust of wind
                        and I was knocked overboard...
                        Greg jumped in, but the current
                          separated us.  That's all I
                          remember.

            Miranda's father steps in.

                                        SEN. ELLIS
                        My daughter's been through quite

                        If I could beg your indulgence
                        for one moment.  I'd like to take

                          sailing.   

          He pulls out a velvet box and takes out a DIAMOND RING.

          The crowd goes wild as Greg slips the ring on her finger

                        There's a helicopter waiting. 
                        You'll be given further
                          instructions on your way back.

          Miranda RISES, the photos still in her hand...

                                        JANUS' VOICE
                        You can leave those on the table
                        if you don't mind.  And have a
                        safe trip home.

          She tosses the photos on to the table and walks away...
          AS the CAMERA REVEALS...          DEAD ZONE: "SAVED" - FOUR - 8/3/05 - GREEN-2          57.


    9696SCATTERED PHOTOGRAPHS

          Candid shots of Miranda and Johnny, everywhere they went
          together since leaving the bus depot.  On every image of
          Johnny is etched the CROSS-HAIRS OF A RIFLE SCOPE.  We
          suddenly realize she's agreed to return in order to save
          Johnny's life... the life of a virtual stranger, but the
          one person willing to risk it all for her.

          We also SEE the pain in the eyes of Vision Johnny as he
          looks on helplessly.

          Out of the vision, Johnny understands now why Miranda
          went back:

                                        JOHNNY
                        She did it to protect me.

                                        BIG MAN
                          I suggest you return the favor
                        and walk away.

          ON MIRANDA, eyes scanning the crowd, searching for JOHNNY,
          his eyes lock on hers.

          ON JANUS, out of sight, away from the fray, but catching
          it all.

          Stillson leads Miranda through the crowd of reporters and
            well-wishers, as Johnny MOVES quickly through from the
          other direction, trying to cut them off at the front door. 
          As she's pushed past Johnny, he deliberately pulls her
          close to him...

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (whispered)
                        I will come for you. 

          She's hustled past him by Stillson, as she steals one
          last desperate glance back.  The look in her eyes almost
          too much for Johnny to handle.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:



          Johnny enters, still wearing the wardrobe he wore at the
          press conference, the evening edition of the local
            newspaper tucked under his arm.

          After he contemplates the wall for a beat, he tears
            something from the "A" section.

          A front page photo.  We don't see it until he tacks it to
          the wall.

          It is a PHOTO OF MIRANDA and STILLSON with the accompanying
          article.  The moment of their engagement, at the press
          conference (still frame from Scene 92). Johnny stares at
          the photo for a beat, then takes it down and RIPS it in
          half, right between Stillson and Miranda.  He then tacks
          each up again, Stillson first, then Miranda's image,
            deliberately (emotionally) separating them.

          After it's complete, Johnny contemplates the wall.

          His life.  His destiny.  His curse.

                                        JOHNNY*
                        It's not over.*

          CAMERA PUSHES IN ON MIRANDA's FACE.*

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)*
                        I promise, it's not over.*



          Johnny, exhausted, troubled, wants to fall into bed.

          As he steps to the dresser, he stops suddenly, and notices
            something behind him in the mirror.  He TURNS, as the
          CAMERA REVEALS something lying on the bed -- a BIBLE.

          A weird feeling washing over Johnny, as he realizes someone
          has been in his bedroom while he was gone.  He picks up
          the Bible and OPENS it...

            "Property of the Hotel Gerard, Washington, D.C."  It's
          the missing Bible from the hotel room where James Stillson
          was killed.  WHOOSH!--
