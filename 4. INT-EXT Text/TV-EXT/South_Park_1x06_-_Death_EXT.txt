               Kyle's mother is standing in front of the town with yet 
               another reporter.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         These boys' minds have been tainted 
                         by the garbage on television that 
                         they see, and we are FED UP!

               A random TOWNSPERSON holds his stomach and runs into a 
               bathroom where thundering shit sounds emerge.

               Garrison runs up to the bathroom door and pounds on it.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         We have to stop this smut from going 
                         on the air! We will march to the 
                         network and PROTEST UNTIL OUR DEMANDS 
                         ARE MET!! NEW YORK, HERE WE COME!!!

               The parents all cheer.

                                   COMMERCIAL BREAK #2

                                          ACT II


               Establishing shot of the filthy, violent, rancid city that 
               is New York.


               Within the city, a mob is gathered out front of the towering 
               skyscraper of Cartoon Central. Kyle's mother stands in front 
               of the crowd with a bullhorn, addressing the crowd.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         We are spreading the word to this 
                         establishment -- That we DEMAND better 
                         television for our children!

               The people cheer.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         We want more QUALITY television like 
                         'Full House'!!

               Several of the South Park residents, however, are waiting in 
               line for one of the two port-o-pottys.

                                     STAN'S FATHER
                         Ooh, I think you gave me the stomach 
                         flu, Mr. Garrison.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         No, no, it was that little Kenny 
                         bastard that gave it to me.

               Mayor McDaniels steps out.

                                     STAN'S DAD
                         Whoa, Mayor, you making gravy in 
                         there?

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         I just had a brown baby boy!

               They all laugh, in spite of themselves.


               The other boys have their ears pinned against the door.

                                     KYLE
                         What are they doing in there?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I don't know...


               Grandpa opens the door. Stan falls out, looking terrible and 
               beaten.

               Grandpa flips off the Enya music, and goes over to Stan.

                                     STAN
                         Grandpa... I... I had no idea how 
                         bad it was for you... Now I 
                         understand...

                                     GRANDPA
                         So now will you kill me, Billy?

                                     STAN
                         Sure I will grandpa... I will.


               The people of South Park are still gathered around South 
               Park, only now, they have chained themselves to the building.

                                     STAN'S MOM
                         It doesn't look like our protest is 
                         working.

                                     KYLE'S MOM
                         It'll work... It has to...

               Suddenly, a well dressed businessman emerges from the doors 
               of the building.

                                     KYLE'S MOM (CONT'D)
                         Look! It's the president of the 
                         network!!

                                     JOHN WARSOG
                         Ladies and gentlemen, my name is 
                         John Warsog. I have prepared a 
                         statement for you on behalf of the 
                         network...

               The people all stand up. Warsog puts on glasses and pulls a 
               piece of paper out of his pocket.

               He clears his throat, and unfolds the piece of paper.

               Finally he begins to read.

                                     JOHN WARSOG
                         'Fuck you.'

               John folds the piece of paper and puts it back into his 
               pocket. He takes off his glasses.

                                     JOHN WARSOG
                         Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. If 
                         there are any questions, you may 
                         direct them to that brick wall over 
                         there.

               John walks back into the building. Kyle's mother is furious.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         HEY, YOU WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH 
                         THIS!!!

               John pauses to pull down his pants and moon the crowd, then 
               continues on into the building.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         THAT DOES IT! NO MORE MR. NICE 
                         PROTESTERS! It's time for PLAN B!

                                     CARTMAN'S MOM
                         Oh Carol, where are the port-o-
                         potties?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Over there hon. What, you need to 
                         drop some friends off at the pool?

                                     CARTMAN'S MOM
                         Oh yes indeedy!

               The two women laugh, in spite of themselves.

               Cartman's mom runs to the toilet, slams the door, and shits 
               up a storm.


               Grandpa is sitting below a large tree.

                                     STAN
                         Okay, grandpa, all you have to do is 
                         sit there. We'll do the rest. You 
                         got the cow all tied up?

               Kyle finishes putting a rope around a scared cow's waist.

                                     KYLE
                         Yep, all done.

                                     STAN
                         Kay, come on, guys.

               The boys all grab the rope, and start to hoist the cow up, 
               using a branch above grandpa's head as a pully.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Why don't we just shoot him?

                                     STAN
                         You dumbass, Cartman! It has to look 
                         natural, or else we'll all get busted.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, stupid.

               The boys pull on the rope and the cow gets hoisted up over 
               grandpa.

                                     GRANDPA
                         That's good, Billy... A little higher 
                         now...

               The cow dangles in the air. The boys wrap their end of the 
               rope around the base of another tree.


               Kyle's mother walks up to the news cameras and the 
               microphones.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         The network isn't taking us seriously. 
                         In the past, people have had to die 
                         for what they believed in, and we 
                         are prepared to do the same. Ready?

               The people near the sling shot all nod.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Mr. McKormick, you shall be a martyr 
                         to us all. God speed.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         WE WILL NOT LET THESE CORPORATE 
                         HALFWITS RUIN OUR CHILDREN'S MINDS!! 
                         LAUNCH!!!

               The sling shot is cut, Mr. McKormick goes flying into the 
               air and hits SPLAT!! into the side of the Toon Central 
               building, dying instantly.

               The news people all gasp.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         We will all follow suit! One by one 
                         if that's what it takes!!

               The line to the port-o-potties is getting longer. People 
               moan with stomach aches.


               The cow dangles dangerously above grandpa. The other end of 
               the rope is tied around a tree.

               Stan holds a knife in his hand, ready to cut the rope, and 
               send the cow on top of his grandfather.

                                     STAN
                         Are you ready grandpa?

                                     GRANDPA
                         Does the Pope crap in the woods?

               Stan is about to cut the rope when suddenly, a light flashes!

               The boys all look over at the road, where Officer Barbrady 
               has pulled up in his patrol car.

               Barbrady studies the scene from his car, he looks at the 
               cow, the grandpa below it, Stan with the knife in his hand...

               The boys' eyes all grow wide.

               A long time passes.

                                     BARBRADY
                         ...Carry on.

               Barbrady drives away. The boys all sigh.

                                     STAN
                         Okay, here we go... Bye Grandpa, it 
                         was nice knowing you.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Cut the damn rope already!

               But now another FLASH!! This one is HUGE. The boys all reel 
               back from its glow.

                                     KYLE
                         Whoa, what is that?!

               When the smoke clears, the boys see a tall figure, dressed 
               in black and carrying a sythe.

                                     STAN
                         Whoa... It looks like... death!

                                     GRANDPA
                         It's about time you late ass lazy 
                         son of a whore!

               Death looks down at Grandpa.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Come on! Let's go!

               But death walks past grandpa and heads towards the boys.

                                     GRANDPA
                         What the --

                                     STAN
                         Hey, he's coming towards US!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Why is Death coming after us?

               But death relentlessly heads for the boys. The boys all scream 
               and run.


                                     REPORTER
                         As the day progresses, more and more 
                         South Park residents continue to 
                         sling shot their bodies into the 
                         side of the Toon Central building.

               Behind him, an OLD LADY flies through the air and splats 
               into the building.

                                     REPORTER
                         Toon Central is under incredible 
                         pressure to cancel the show, and has 
                         already lost over 20 percent of their 
                         sponsors...

               Kyle's mother walks up to Stan's mother and hands her a cell 
               phone.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Here, Carol, I think it's your boy.

                                     STAN'S MOTHER
                         Oh, thanks.
                              (Into the phone)
                         What is it, Stanly hon? Did you break 
                         something?


                                     STAN'S MOTHER
                         Stanly honey, you need to leave Mommy 
                         alone, I'm doing something very very 
                         important for your little well-being 
                         there.

                         Yeah, but mom --

                                     STAN'S MOTHER
                         Here honey, talk to your father.

               Stan's dad gets on the phone.

                                     STAN'S FATHER
                         Did you turn the heat down?

                                     STAN
                         Dad, death is coming --

                         care of your grandfather.

               Click.


               The boys run screaming down South Park avenue. Death pursues 
               them on a tricycle.

               Grandpa is pursuing Death in his wheelchair.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Come back here you pompass son of a 
                         panzy!

               Slowly, Death catches up to the boys, he stretches out his 
               bony hand...

                                     STAN
                         AAGH!!

                                     KYLE
                         Don't let him touch you! You die if 
                         he touches you!!

                                     GRANDPA
                         I'm over here you son of a whore!

               Death chases the boys past a TV shop, where dozens of TVs 
               are on in the window.

               They are all playing Terrance and Phillip.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

               Terrance and Phillip are floating through space with little 
               space suits on.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Oh Terrance... What color is the 
                         wind?

               Death looks intrigued.

                                     TERRANCE
                         I don't know why don't you check --

               Terrance turns his ass towards Phillip and farts.

                                     PHILLIP
                         OH! YOU FARTED!!

               Death laughs loudly. He has to lay down his scythe to hold 
               his stomach.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Hey Phillip, you know what my space 
                         suit smells like?

                                     PHILLIP
                         No, Terrance, why don't you tell me.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Well, it smells like... A dirty fart!

               They laugh. Death laughs even harder.

                                     STAN
                         Hey look!

               The boys stop running and notice that death is watching the 
               show.

               Everybody gathers around the TV and watches. Laughing happily 
               together.


               The reporter is standing out front of the Toon Central 
               building.

                                     REPORTER
                         Hours have passed and still the die 
                         hard South Park parents are killing 
                         themselves in front of the Toon 
                         Central building one by one.

               Another person splats into the side of the building.

                                     REPORTER (CONT'D)
                         Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems 
                         to be going around is... Wait, wait... 
                         I'm getting word that John Warsog, 
                         the president of the network is going 
                         to make a statement!

               Warsog again takes the stand, just as another MAN is about 
               to be released from the sling shot. A look of relief crosses 
               the man's face.

                                     JOHN WARSOG
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, your Nazi-esque 
                         tactics of trying to stink us out 
                         with your rancid feces... has worked.

               The people look confused. The port-o-potties are indeed backed 
               up.

                                     JOHN WARSOG
                         Therefore, today we will officially 
                         be taking 'Terrance and Phillip' off 
                         the network, and replacing it with 
                         reruns of 'She's The Sheriff.' 
                         Starring Suzanne Summers.

               The people all rejoice and cheer.

                                     JOHN WARSOG
                         Now get away from here and take your 
                         diarrhea with you!

               The townspeople all cheer and rejoice. The two guys at the 
               sling shot accidentally let it go, and the man goes flying 
               into the air and splats against the building.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Now at last we can return to 
                         normality!


               The boys and death are still happily watching Terrance and 
               Phillip.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Hey Phillip.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Yes Terrance.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Is there a penny stuck in my butt?

                                     PHILLIP
                         I don't know Terrance, let me check...

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, oh. Don't look there Phillip, 
                         you're going to get farted on!!

               Phillip moves his head towards Terrance's ass when suddenly 
               FWOOP! A second of static and then the Toon Central logo.

               The boys and death look confused.

                                     NARRATOR
                         We interrupt this program to bring 
                         you some loud static.

               Loud static fills the screen.

               Death goes absolutely ballistic. It lets out a horrible cry.

                                     DEATH
                         MARRRR!!!!!

               And turns back on the boys.

                                     KYLE
                         AAGH!!

               Death stretches out its skeleton hand and touches Kenny.

               Kenny immediately falls to the ground.

                                     KYLE
                         Oh my God! They killed Kenny!!

               The boys stop and look at Kenny's motionless body.

                                     KYLE
                              (To Death)
                         You bastard!!

                                     STAN
                         Wow, I guess Death was just coming 
                         after Kenny the whole time.

               Grandpa wheels himself up, panting.

                                     GRANDPA
                         HEY! You were supposed to kill ME!!

               Death shakes its head.

                                     GRANDPA
                         That's not fair, God Dammit! My 
                         grandpa asked me to kill him and I 
                         did it!

               Death says nothing, but points his boney finger to a glowing 
               fog.

                                     STAN
                         Whoa...

               In the glowing fog, another EXTREMELY OLDER man appears, 
               floating above the ground.

                                     OLD OLD MAN
                         Billy...

                                     GRANDPA
                         Grandpa?

                                     OLD OLD MAN
                         That's right, Billy.

                                     GRANDPA
                         My name's not Billy, Grandpa! And 
                         what's wrong with you? Why do you 
                         look all haggard?

                                     OLD OLD MAN
                         I asked you to kill me, Billy, but I 
                         was wrong... And now I am forced to 
                         spend eternity in limbo.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Limbo?

                                     OLD OLD MAN
                         I was wrong to put you in that 
                         position, Billy. Just like you're 
                         wrong to put little Billy in it now. 
                         You're so obsessed with ending your 
                         life, you're not thinking about what 
                         you're doing to his.

               Grandpa thinks.

                                     OLD OLD MAN
                         You must wait to die of natural 
                         causes.

                                     GRANDPA
                         But I've been waiting for twenty-
                         five years! Let nature run its course, 
                         or else end up in limbo...

               The old old man starts to fade away. He, death and Kenny all 
               float up to the sky.

                                     OLD OLD MAN
                         Natural causes, Billy... Natural 
                         causes...

                                     STAN
                         C'mon you guys, let's go home.

               Rats come and pull Kenny away.
