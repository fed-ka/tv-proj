A sensei once counseled a grief-
stricken boy, as his older brother

prepared to leave for battle.
N STARS - Begin to see a DOZEN or so stars, almost forming a
zig-zagged line. Cam continues to adjust.
SPLINTER (V.O.)

He said, "Child, why do you cry?
You are both part of a family. And
a family is a bond that cannot be
broken by war. By strife. By force
or neglect.
N STARS - Cam slows its truck-out to a gradual stop as we
see the pattern beginning to form. As if following the stars'

SUPER TITLE: SOME STINKING JUNGLE IN SOUTH AMERICA
CAM RESTS atop an old CHURCH ROOF. The peaceful scene is
suddenly stopped by a MACHINE GUN BURST! CAM CRANES over the
O
roof revealing -

A relatively modern village... for a remote jungle. Dawn is
JUST barely beginning to break. The morning mist persists as
we see FOUR FEDERALES with machine guns surrounding a group
of VILLAGERS.
O
N GROUND - A WOMAN VILLAGER is thrown down. Her SON, 8, runs
1
to her side. She's mad. Her son cries.
2.
WOMAN VILLAGER
You monsters!
UP ANGLE - As we see the THREE FEDERALES, greasy men, holding
AK-47's, and looking down with hardened indifference. OS, we
hear an EVIL CHUCKLE. The men part as we see-
- COL. PANTERA. A bottom-heavy disgusting pig of a man walks
up between them. Pantera leans down, face to face with her.
PANTERA
We appreciate the generous donation
for the continued protection of
your village.
ANGLE ON - Their jeep, overflowing with the Village's
precious crops.
WIDER - A tiny group (10) of other villagers stand at a safe
distance. The Woman's HUSBAND runs forward. He immediately
LUNGES at Pantera, just as-
-SHIKA-SHIKA - Pantera is flanked by 3 MACHINE GUNS pointed
at the Husband's chest. Pantera slothfully grins. He leans
forward and yanks an HEIRLOOM NECKLACE from her neck.
PANTERA
After all, the jungle can be a very
dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA.
They jump into the Jeep and tear into the jungle LAUGHING.

The jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path. Pantera sits
in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in around the
food. The Jungle looms ominous around them.
H
IGH ANGLE - As we watch the jeep from the jungle ceiling
high above... as if from someone's POV.
ON DRIVER - He suddenly reacts to a fallen tree on the road
ahead. Slams on the brakes. Pantera is thrown around.
PANTERA
Idiota! Watch where you're going!
DRIVER SOLIDER
There's a log on the road, senor.
(quietly to himself)
...that wasn't there an hour ago.
PANTERA
Well, what are you waiting for?!
REMOVE IT!
(to soldiers behind)
Cortez! Andelay!

CORTEZ leaps out. Grabs the winch from the front of the jeep
and pulls it to the log, roughly 15 feet away.
EEP POV - Pantera and Driver barely notice the out-of-focus
bg Cortez get suddenly YANKED out of scene!
CORTEZ (O.S.)
...yirk!
ON DRIVER - His eyes go wide. Trying to see in the dark.
DRIVER SOLIDER
(softly, nervous)
D-d-dios mio.
ON LOG - Cortez is gone. Pantera wakes up.
PANTERA
What?! WHAT IS IT?!
OS - Hear the sound of a CHAIN clinking. Then WHOOSHING as
the chain winch suddenly FLIES IN, and CRACKS the BURLY
SOLDIER across the jaw! It wraps itself around his neck.
Before he can react...
- YOINK! He gets pulled over the hood of the jeep, landing on
the ground HARD.
URLY SOLDIER
OOF!
Burly gets pulled backward... away from the Jeep and into...
the darkness. He SCREAMS the entire way, clawing the ground.
ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now. Last Soldier is in the
back. Pantera stands up in the jeep. "Last" jumps out and
readies his machine gun.
PANTERA
(to Jungle)
WHO ARE YOU?! SHOW YOURSELF!!
DRIVER SOLIDER
(WHISPER)
...The Ghost of the Jungle.
PANTERA
What?!
DRIVER SOLDIER
(
shaking/nervous)
The jungle god that punishes those
who prey upon the weak.
(looks scared to Pantera)
He's coming... for us.

OS NOISE - Suddenly hear the whooshing of 4 quick punches,
kicks, a short machine gun burst and a WHUMP. Pantera and
Driver look to the ground.
ON GROUND - Last Soldier lays beaten on the jungle floor.
DRIVER SOLIDER
I'm sorry, senor.
Driver bounds out of the Jeep and runs SCREAMING into the
jungle. CAM PULLS BACK with him as Pantera shrinks in bg.
PANTERA
COWARD!! GET BACK HERE!!
Something suddenly skitters behind Pantera! He turns to look.
Nothing. He reaches down and pulls up... a MACHETE.
PANTERA
SHOW YOURSELF! DO YOU REALIZE WHO
YOU'RE DEALING WITH?!
ON PANTERA - He circles backs against the Jungle wall, trying
to find him. Tense. Suddenly-
-a PAIR OF WHITE EYES open in the blackness behind him!
n a quick series of shots we see Pantera getting the raw end
of a flurry of fist and foot attacks. His attacker is moving
way too fast for the camera to keep up.
Pantera falls back, panting heavily. Panicked. He tears off
into the dense Jungle!
ON PANTERA RUNNING THROUGH JUNGLE - Thick foliage. Panicked.

An oasis of calm, violated by this sweating, machete-
clutching brute. He stumbles, then stands in the middle.
ANTERA
I am not afraid of a myth!
(eyes darting)
A
I'M NOT AFRAID OF A GHOST!
TTACKER (O.S.)
Actually... it's "Turtle", pal.
Pantera swings around. Eyes wide.
N ATTACKER - We pan up the thick green legs. Muscular and
strong. Further up. Arms to match. Rough skin. It wears a
shorn HOODED PONCHO. Inside are two white eyes and gritted
smiling teeth.
The poncho falls to the ground.
5.
ON ATTACKER - It's LEONARDO! Beaten blue bandana blowing in
the breeze. Total hero shot. He pulls out a SINGLE KATANA
SWORD, poised for battle. Pantera's backed into a corner.
PANTERA
Let's see if a ghost can die, then.
Pantera SCREAMS and runs to Leo and starts swinging! At the
CLASH of sword and machete, we-
SMASH CUT TO:

The Boy is still at the Village Clearing. Suddenly -
- the sound of the JEEP begins to rumble in the distance! The
villagers panic and scatter. VROOM! The Jeep flies out of the
jungle and bounce-slows into the FG!
Only there is no one driving it... and it still has the
stolen food in it. And the stolen medallion dangles from the
rear view mirror.
WOMAN VILLAGER
It's a miracle!
The village rejoices. The Boy steps aside for a beat, looks
back at the Jungle. Something catches his eye.
...a small crouched figure on a tree branch. Barely
silhouetted. His white eyes lit in the darkness. One of them
WINKS as the boy smiles.

OY VILLAGER
(beaming... softly)
The Ghost of the Jungle.

A mouse-level shot of the spectacular city that never sleeps.
It's oddly hypnotic. Still. Until...
- BAM! A pair of sneakers land barely in front of the camera,
tearing off into the distance.
NYPD #1 (O.S.)
FREEEZE! STOP OR WE'LL SHOOT!
Shoes belong to a panicked MUGGER, early 20's, as THREE NYPD
OFFICERS clamor after him. The Mugger is a jackrabbit -
hopping newspaper machines, rolling under passing trucks and
doing anything he can to avoid arrest.
ventually the NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles.
MUGGER
Heh, heh... suckers.
ON MUGGER - His eyes suddenly go wide as - VROOOOOM! - we see
a jet-black tweaked out motorcycle fly over the cops' heads,
aiming directly for Mugger!
MUGGER
Whaaa!!!
The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in
all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet. Scary
and faceless. He quickly gains on the Mugger and GRABS him by
the collar in mid-stride!
MUGGER
You crazy?! Put me down, man!
But Driver doesn't. Instead, he holds him lower without
stopping the bike... and proceeds to plow Mugger's head into
every trash can and garbage bin along 9th Avenue!
MUGGER
OW! HEY! WHAT'RE YOU-OW!! OOF!
Just as it looks like he'll hit a telephone pole... Driver
veers left! He drags the Mugger into...
O

Driver tosses him onto the ground at full speed. Mugger
SLIDES down the alley and collides with a pile of garbage
like he's a human bowling ball.
ON HEAD OF ALLEY - The Driver guns the bike and kicks up a
ton of dust and racket, peeling donuts at mouth of the alley.
And then he stops. Dust slowly settles and smoke dissipates.
MUGGER
Wh-wh-what kinda freak are you?!
The Driver gets off the bike. Silence. Backlit by headlight.
He walks directly to the Mugger with purpose. Mugger starts
to really freak out. Driver picks him up by the collar and
SLAMS him to the back WOODEN FENCE WALL.
MUGGER
P-p-please. Don't kill me, man.
Driver just cocks his head. Mugger can see his own terrified
reflection his Driver's black visor. Driver reaches behind
his back and pulls out a COMBAT KNIFE! He reels back and...
MUGGER
Wh-wha-wha-WHAT ARE YOU DOI- AAAGH!
W
HAM! - Driver nails the dagger through the Mugger's JACKET,
PINNING HIM TO THE WALL. Driver turns around to gather the
purse's belongings at the mouth of the alley.
fter he stops cringing, the Mugger wriggles the blade out of
the wall. Driver doesn't notice as - THWIP-IP-IP! - he hurls
the knife at the Driver!
THUNK! It sticks in the DRIVER'S BACK!
N MUGGER - His grinning eyes suddenly GO WIDE as Driver
slowly turns around, UNHURT! The Mugger is trapped as Driver
moves toward him... and a BOLO CHAIN drops to his side.
ON WALL SHADOW - as we see a flurry of punches, kicks and
throws as Driver lays a beating on the criminal who needs to
be taught a lesson. An OS Police Siren chirps.
MOUTH OF ALLEY - The police suddenly show up, cherries
flashing. They run to FG, mouths drop.
NYPD #1
...whoa.
NYPD #2
The Nightwatcher.
8.
ON MUGGER - Hung upside down by a chain. Purse hangs from his
neck. He'll live, but never commit another crime again...
11
11
CLOSE ON A NEWSSTAND - Headlines read "WOMAN MYSTERIOUSLY
RESCUED FROM BURNING BUILDING". "POLICE SEEK MAN KNOWN AS
`THE NIGHTWATCHER' FOR QUESTIONING". "WHO IS THE
NIGHTWATCHER?"
WIDER - A quieter area of the city. Broken by the squealing
of the bike as Driver (Nightwatcher) roars in to a stop.
Nightwatcher drives underneath a TRAIN BRIDGE. He takes off
his helmet. Red cloth spills out. He turns around as we see-
- RAPHAEL, THE RED-MASKED NINJA TURTLE!
He reaches back and pulls out the KNIFE from his SHELL. Looks
at it, shaking his head and grinning. He sheathes it.
R
APHAEL
Heh, heh. Nice try, chump.
QUICK SHOTS - Ignites and revs engine. Straps helmet back on.
Headlight comes to life. Lets the clutch out.
VROOOOM! - CAM STARTS TIGHT ON bike as Raphael tears away.
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
Dude... I'm scared!
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - A PAIR OF TURTLE EYES... MICHAELANGELO'S! They're
wide with FEAR. Nervously darting around, unable to keep up
with the surrounding danger.
MICHAELANGELO
Dude! They're all around me! What
do I do? WHAT DO I DO?!
Mikey's eyes continue to panic. DONATELLO's voice comes in
over a RADIO. Calming.
DONATELLO (O.S.)
Just relax, Mikey. Remember your
training. You'll be fine.
MICHAELANGELO
But I need back up this time, man!
BACK UP!
DONATELLO (O.S.)
(SIGHS)
...you're such a prima donna.

CAM PULLS BACK TO REVEAL WE'RE IN-

Beautiful downtown autumnal street. Parked in front, we see
the "COWABUNGA CARL" PARTY VAN loudly decorated in kid-
friendly colors with an embarrassing and low-tech looking
TURTLE HEAD ON TOP. PUSH IN on upstairs apartment window.
S
OCCER MOM (O.S.)
Thanks so much. You're worth every
penny. I have to tell all my
friends about you. You'll love
their kids too.

Mikey opens the van's rear doors. He PULLS OFF the fake
zipper on his chest and then pulls off his fake turtle head.
His trademark orange bandana spills out.
He turns, breathing in the fresh surface air. A quiet beat
until - A POLICE SIREN approaches, faint, in the distance.
Mikey jumps in the van, slams the door shut as the car
whizzes by.
WIDER - the van takes off down the street.
11.
DONATELLO (O.S.)
Hey, hey, hey... don't forget the
face thing.
16
16
CLOSE ON - a regular motorist sitting in his car at a traffic
light. Don monitors from a small dashboard cam. Man looks OS
Left. Reacts.
OFF HIS LOOK - We see Mikey beside him in the van. He's
behind the wheel - face FROZEN in a goofy SMILE like a
ventriloquist to "hide" his identity. Don follows on a small
surveillance cam under the rearview mirror.
MICHAELANGELO
Yes... sir.
DONATELLO (O.S.)
That's a good boy.
MICHAELANGELO
All's I'm saying Donnie is that no
one would notice if YOU did one of
these gigs every now and again.
DONATELLO (O.S.)
But you add such... panache to the
character.
Mikey, emotional, pops into "fully animated" facial mode. He
rubs his sore neck.
MICHAELANGELO
Well, if panache is French for
"punching bag", I'd have to agree
with ya.
18

DONATELLO (O.S.)
-you got a peeping tom.
M
12.
ON CAR - The Man is still looking - only now really freaked
out - at the fully animated Mikey head.
MICHAELANGELO
Aw nuts.
Mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight SMILE,
frozen. He looks over and waves at the man who confusingly
waves back.
MICHAELANGELO
(ventriloquist style)
Just get me outta here, dude.
ON DON - He hits some switches. Monitors change.
DONATELLO
Traffic's clear eastbound for two
blocks. Then hook up with route J.
BACK WITH MIKEY - He's still waving with a frozen smile.
ICHAELANGELO
(ventriloquist style)
Righteous.
Mikey immediately "unfreezes" and sticks his tongue out and
antics at the Man! Before the man can react, Mikey TEARS OUT
and zips across traffic down a deserted side-street.
...as we notice the annoying ice cream style music tinkering
M
along with his gaining speed.
ICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
You HAD to install the music too...
DONATELLO (O.S.)
All part of the cover, my friend.
CUT TO:

The van parks in a long-forgotten alleyway. A dummy gate
closes behind it, obscuring it from view.
UNDER THE VAN - We see it's parked over a manhole cover. It
slowly slides shut.

The street noise below is barely audible. Camera creeps along
the edge of the building, reaching a row of GARGOYLES.
AN ALONG GARGOYLES - Still. Concrete. Creepy. Just as we
pass the fourth, we barely notice it's WHITE EYES OPENING.
QUICK SNAP BACK TO GARGOYLE - Only now it's gone. Something
strange is coming to town...

Large freighters. Lots of activity. PUSH IN on a steamer as a
crane lowers a LARGE VERTICAL CRATE to the dock - it THUMPS
down hard.
APRIL (O.S.)
Careful! That isn't some box full
of fish!
CAM LOWERS - as APRIL O'NEIL leaps down into frame. Dressed
in jungle expedition gear with her head wrapped in a bandana.
She takes off her sunglasses and admires the crate.
ON BOX - Labelled "O'Neil Cargo". Something ominous about the
crate. PUSH IN on it as April steps in front. Admires it with
pride. Turns, takes out a cell phone, and hits speed dial.
ON PHONE DISPLAY - "Calling HOME". It rings.
APRIL
(impatient mutter)
Where are you?
26

A large JET LINER flies into the city. Lowering. The wheels
fold out under the carriages.
CLOSER - LEO is on the landing gear, his face lit up by the
city glow in front of him. He jumps off as - FOOMP! - a HANG-
GLIDER opens up from his backpack. He lowers the glider to
the water and RELEASES!
33
33
Now outside the window, he smiles at the view.
WINTERS
Tell them I'm on my way down.
He slowly LOWERS OUT OF FRAME. CAM PULLS OUT WIDER REVEALING -
Winters Office is an "elevator" of sorts that can ride up
and down the front of the building, allowing him access to
any floor of his Tower without leaving his desk.
WIDER - see the Tower is a monolith in the middle of
Manhattan - complete with it's own front Central Park-ish
gated entry. A true work of modern architecture.
WIPE TO:

CLOSE ON - A familiar-looking white HOCKEY MASK. Eyes blink
behind it.
ID 1
Yo, Case? Wanna be goalie?
The mask is pushed aside by Casey - Kid 1 was holding it.
CASEY
Nah, you know I work for a livin'.
It's Star Center or nothin' else.
C
27.
WIDER - Casey is with 5 other KIDS prepping for a game of
STREET HOCKEY, using tennis balls and trash cans. Chubbier
KID 2 walks by and grabs the mask himself.
KID 2
Whatever! Let's get it on!
They begin a boisterous round of hockey. Trash talk, gentle
checking and all the requisite boy things. We see that the
kids love Casey. And vice versa. Suddenly-
BROOKLYN MOM (O.S.)
TOMMY!! IT'S TIME FOR DINNER!
TOMMY (KID 1)
BUT MA! WE JUST STARTED!
BROOKLYN MOM
(snapping back)
THOMAS!
Tommy's defeated. Looks at the disappointed boys.
TOMMY
Sorry dudes.
CASEY
Busted! Have fun with your mommy...
(face falls, disappointed)
...oh no.
OFF HIS LOOK - We see APRIL, dressed stunning in a dark
business suit at the other side of the street. She's dangling
a WHITE SHIRT and a TIE from her other hand.
ASEY
Aw, c'mon April! We just started!
April just gives him "the look" with an eyebrow cock. Casey
knows he can't win.
KID 2
Can't Casey stay and play for just
five more minutes, Miss O'Neil?
Pleeeeeeease?
APRIL
Not today, Nate. Mister Jones has
to pretend to be an adult for a few
hours.
KIDS
Awwwww! Man! Baaah!
Casey hands his stick, then quickly turns with a grin.
CASEY
Later boys!
28.
CAM FOLLOWS April and Casey as they walk down the street.
April's not really a hard-ass - she's just forced to be the
"responsible one" in A
the relationship.
PRIL
I need your help with a delivery.
CASEY
(Arnold voice)
Do you need my funtahstick muscles?
APRIL
(UNENTHUSED)
Heh-heh... yeah.
Casey awkwardly places his arm over her shoulder as the cam
rests and they walk into the distance. He pulls it back down.
CAM ANGLES ON WALL - As we notice CLAW MARKS sliced into the
concrete exterior of a building.
CUT TO:
-the armor becomes the back of a HELMET. Camera dollies
around the helmet until we're looking at a dark and imposing
figure. YAOTL. His helmet is impenetrable, with eye slits.
Note - the flashback is dark, shadowed and monochromed.
Detail is hinted at instead of shown. Very stylized.
WINTERS (V.O.)
It was a time long before the
Mayans, April. Long before the
Aztecs and even the Olmecs. It was
a time of legends. A time of
greatness. The true mother culture
of Central America.
Cool shots of Yaotl. His armor, his stance, etc.
INTERS (V.O.)
There was a man named Yaotl. More a
force of nature than man. And
together with his Four Warrior-
Priest Generals, they pillaged
every culture in their path.
QUICK SHOTS OF EACH GENERAL. The walk along side Yoatl.
Possibly slo-mo. We will come to recognize them through their
distinct armor as the Four Stone Generals - in human form.
WINTERS (V.O.)
And for every culture they
destroyed, they drank in all the
magic and knowledge known to them.
(MORE)
O
31.
WINTERS(cont'd)
They became a warring hurricane,
gathering more power and knowledge
with each conquest.
GROUP SHOT - Of five Warriors. High atop a hillside, finally
stopped. Ready for battle. Their character-specific weapons
are drawn. Around them is a small army of MINIONS.
WINTERS (V.O.)
Then they came across a culture
rich with science, magic and their
own technology. A South American
version of "Atlantis".
(
BEAT)
It was like blood in the water for
a predator like Yaotl.
CLOSE ON - Yaotl. As he raises his sword in the air. CAM
DOLLIES AROUND HIS HEAD REVEALING their opposing forces. An
army of THOUSANDS. Waving their weapons in the air.
The opposing army CHARGES. Yaotl's men pull out
a large
ORNAMENTAL STAND - a "stargate" of sorts. Yaotl
and his men
are unmoving... as they begin a ceremony. Yaotl
looks to the
heavens above - as we see a CLUSTER OF SPECIFIC
STARS move
into place.
WINTERS (V.O.)
As the army approached, Yaotl used
the knowledge they'd gained in
black magic and sorcery. Timing
their attack with the alignment of
the Stars of Kikin, they opened a
portal to another world.
ON CHARGING ARMY - they stop dead in their tracks. Front-lit
by the OS portal. Don't know what to expect -
ON PORTAL - A crackling electric circle opens to another
dimension. Suddenly - DOZENS OF MONSTERS EXPLODE OUT!
Creatures of all varieties. Gnashing Fangs. Swiping claws.
WINTERS (V.O.)
They unleashed an army of monsters.
N BATTLEFIELD - men getting slaughtered (in a nice PG sort
of way). Quick shots. Intense.
WINTERS (V.O.)
The monsters knew no side
- they
destroyed the enemy... as
well as
Yaotl's own army. Men who
swore to
spill their blood for his
cause.
Yaotl had to do something
to stop
more from coming through.

from pouring out. End on a scream. Dissolve to LATER in the
battle...

Desolate, destroyed battlefield. Smoldering. Bodies
everywhere. No monsters. End pan on Yaotl on his knees.
WINTERS (V.O.)
In the end, there were no victors.
And they were responsible for the
eradication of the greatest culture
that will never be known. The
knowledge that was lost would never
be found again...
DISSOLVE BACK TO PRESENT DAY IN WINTERS' OFFICE
Casey has fallen asleep, sitting to the side, head in his
hand. A line of DROOL hangs from his mouth. April is
fascinated by the story. She nudges Casey who does the
slurp/half-snore wake up.

April and Casey leave Winters, consumed with his new
treasure. He doesn't reply.

The glowing eye is really a STAR. The same line pattern we
saw at movie's open. The stars ADJUST... lining up in a more
straight-lined manner.
CAM LOWERS, placing us back in-

A MAN walks down the sidewalk. As he passes a DARKENED
ALLEYWAY, he hears a low GROWL come from it. He stops.
ALLEY POV - As the man looks in. Can't see a thing. Hand-held
cam. He moves to leave... and the growl comes again.
STREET - Man stares in. No one on the street. Looks closer...
closer... grows more tense as...
35.
...WHAM! The requisite CAT jumps out of the shadows. Scares
Man half to death.
MAN
WAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!
(calms down)
Gave me a scare kitty.
He pets the kitty a bit, then walks off. CAM LOWERS behind
cat, as Man walks off into the distance. Until...
...WHAM! A large burly CLAWED ARM slams out of the shadows
onto the cat, yanking it back into the alley! Quick
caterwaul. Silence. And then we hear a BURP.

with an air duct pipe. Zips faster and faster until we're in-

distance.

ICHAELANGELO
First one to touch old faithful
over there-
DONATELLO
-does the other team's chores for a
week.
Leo and Raph glare at each other.
LEONARDO/RAPHAEL
Deal.
MICHAELANGELO
I'm with Leo!
DONATELLO
Actually, I think you and I should
pair up, Mikey.
MICHAELANGELO
You kiddin' me?! I mean, no offense
Donnie, but you ain't exactly the
biggest hitter on the bench.
T
37.
Don is grinning. Observing the subtle tension.
DONATELLO
Just trust me on this one.
Music builds to a fun number as the two teams run parallel on
buildings. The course requires them to work as a TEAM,
throwing, catching and propelling one another from obstacle
to obstacle.
Leo accidentally slips, PLOWING Raph face-first into a brick
wall. Raph, convinced Leo did it on purpose, uses his next
opportunity to hurl Leo dangerously high and far over a
billboard. The situation escalates at each juncture.
LEONARDO
Have you been avoiding me? Barely
seen you since I got home.
RAPHAEL
I been busy.
LEONARDO
(SARCASTIC)
I see. So... you're definitely not
upset at me or anything, right?
RAPHAEL
Why'd you think that?
LEONARDO
I don't know... your brother gets
to go on a world-wide training
mission and you have to stay home.
Might upset me too.
RAPHAEL
Are you trying to make me mad?
LEONARDO
I'm just saying, I'd understand if
you were upset.
Their intensity ESCALATES.
RAPHAEL
You wouldn't understand the first
thing about me, daddy's boy - OOF!.
hey both trip over a duct, tumbling in a ball. They stop
rolling, continue fighting.
LEONARDO
Is that what this is about? You
think Splinter likes me best?
RAPHAEL
You'd love that, wouldn't you?
M
38.
WIDER - Don and Mikey are already sitting there.
MICHAELANGELO
So nice of you to join us,
gentledudes.
DONATELLO
And by the way, I prefer the
classic military corner tuck for my
bedsheets.
M
ikey and Don high five. Leo and Raph aren't amused. They
stare down. Raph does his BULLY FLINCH fake-lunge... only Leo
doesn't twitch. Suddenly-
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
Whoa! Whawazzat?!
The others rush over to the edge with Mikey.
ICHAELANGELO
You dudes see that up there?
OFF HIS LOOK - We see LARGE SHADOWS moving with in a large I-
BEAM CONSTRUCTION SITE. The movement is coming from one of
the higher floors.
MICHAELANGELO
So what now, captain?
LEONARDO
We need to come up with a plan.
RAPHAEL
Later!
Raph RUNS OFF toward the action.
LEONARDO
RAPH!!!
But Raph doesn't stop. All three look at each other. Then-
MICHAELANGELO
Welcome home.

The boys cross over on a large CONSTRUCTION CRANE and scale
up the few more stories to the top. They stand on a scaffold
underneath the floor of the activity.
ON WALL - Deep CLAW MARKS are carved into the steel, much
like by April and Casey's loft. Don notices.
DONATELLO
Guys, I've got a bad feeling...
L
M
39.
RAPHAEL
Ahh, let's take a tiny peek.
They scale to the top floor. Peering over the edge.
MICHAELANGELO
Well, there's a good/bad news
scenario for ya.
CAM BEGINS TO CRANE UP from Turtles to activity on the floor.
MICHAELANGELO
Good news is that there are a
buncha Foot Ninja gettin' the snot
kicked out of `em.
CAM FINISHES ON FLOOR - Showing SIX FOOT NINJAS and KARAI
squaring off against a LARGE BIGFOOT-LIKE MONSTER! It tosses
them around like stuffed animals.
ICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
Bad news is WHAT's kickin' the snot
out of `em...
ON TURTLES - As they've all now crept up to the dark corner
of the floor. A FOOT NINJA gets clobbered and sails past
them, and off the building. (safely to a scaffold below)
D
ONATELLO
An interesting conundrum. Do we
hold dear the value of life and
help the Foot regardless of our
tumultuous past?
MICHAELANGELO
I vote for sitting back and
enjoying the show.
(to Leo)
Whaddaya say, leader boy?
ON LEO - He's troubled. The burden of "leader" shouldered.
RAPHAEL
Nah. We kick butt.
Raph jumps forward! Leo rolls his eyes, as all the Turtles
jump into the fray. The Foot are surprised at first, and the
Bigfoot Monster is confused as well.
ON LEO - He stops when he comes face to face with Karai.
EONARDO
Who are YOU?!
ON KARAI - She pauses a moment. They exchange expert katana
attacks. Stalemate. She gestures to the Foot as they use this
opportunity for their escape. As they leap away, Karai looks
back at the Turtles...
R
40.
The Creature immediately CHASES the boys throughout the
structure, as they use all their ninja skills to avoid it,
not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below!
aph tries to turn the tables and attacks the Creature! The
boys have no choice but to help him... putting them in deeper
trouble.
The I-Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact.
The tussle begins to fall - whoomp, whoomp - down many
flights of floors.
Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the
building to catch up, and swings himself back onto the bottom
floor to await the others.
SMASH! They fall into Raph's floor.
RAPHAEL
Nice of ya's ta join me.
But the Turtles eventually get cornered. And just as the
Creature closes in-
MICHAELANGELO
YEEEAAAAARGGHHH!!!!!
The creature stops. Confused. So are the other three turtles.
MICHAELANGELO
What? I saw it on a nature show
once.
The creature SCREAMS BACK! Boys freak out.
TURTLES
AAAAAAGGHHHHH!!!!!
A
NGLE ABOVE TURTLES - As a large teetering pallet filled with
dried cement and blocks to come CRASHING DOWN ON THEM! The
Turtles are buried under the rubble.
RUH? - The Creature is confused... until it's hit with a
blinding light, and then an EXPLOSION - FWOOM! We hear heavy
footsteps thumping through the light. Shapes start to form
until we see...
...LIVING VERSIONS OF THE FOUR STONE GENERALS! Sporting HIGH
TECH GEAR - a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings.
Their bodies "glow" with a red inner life, seeping through
their stone cracks and piercing eyes.
The Generals are all ANIMAL-THEMED - Mute and powerful Ape-
themed costume ("MONO"), Eagle Leader ("AGUILA"), agile
Jaguar ("GATO") and the deadly snake-like female
("SERPIENTE"). Large. Imposing. Completely bad-ass.
The Creature ROARS and FIGHTS to no avail...
41.
BURIED POV - Silent. The Turtles start to GROAN, regaining
consciousness. Moonlight shoots in as they move the rock and
stand up, groggy.
ON MOUTH OF ALLEY - Through the smoke we can see silhouettes -
a large hairy shape, along with FOUR VERY LARGE SHAPES. The
sounds of freighter doors CLOSING, engines revving and then a
caravan of sorts pulling away.
WHOOOOOP! - A POLICE SIREN chirps. Approaching the now-
destroyed site.
DONATELLO
Better hit the tunnels, guys.
Donnie uses a small prod to prop open a MANHOLE COVER. Don,
Mike and Leo jump in. Leo looks back, Raph is still stewing.
LEONARDO
Raph. Save it for another day.
(BEAT)
RAPH!
Raph knows he has to go. Reluctantly he enters the sewer. The
lid closes as the alley is illuminated by POLICE CHERRIES.
A
beat, then Mikey barely pops the lid open for another peek.
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
Y'know, it's not that bad, dudes.
ON BUILDING - Actually, the place is destroyed. Dented, torn
and looking like a post-night raid in WWII.

He's swallowed it all up to this point... getting harder.
BEGIN MONSTER HUNTING MONTAGE

Aggressive and driving music. Various shots of the Stone
Generals capturing a laundry list of CREATURES that are
coming into the city. See the tech, detail and precision that
the Winters' operation works. Foot Ninja act as living
"tracking devices" around the city.
- The Generals capture a Sloth-like creature, jumping in
throughout rafters above. The Foot try to help by blocking
exits.
- The Generals capture a werewolf-like creature in the high-
speed subway tunnels. The Foot maneuver the subway car.
- General Mono takes on a large scale YETI-like monster. A
WWE-sized match set in a large abandoned warehouse.
- Close calls, as humans come close to seeing the monsters...
but rarely do. We see small house pets swiped away. Fleeting
glimpses of limbs, claws and teeth in the shadows all over
NYC. Meat trucks torn open and their contents "stolen".
- Intermix quick shots of Generals and collars clamping,
cells locking, etc.

- See more cells being filled in Winters Basement. ONLY 3
EMPTY CELLS REMAIN.
CUT TO:

Quiet part of the neighborhood. Their lights are fully on.
APRIL (O.S.)
You sure you don't want to spar a
bit?
Casey climbs up from the fire escape. Checks to make sure
he's alone. He reaches inside a chimney flue and pulls out -
A BASEBALL BAT and his CLASSIC WHITE HOCKEY MASK!
He slips it on. Does a few warm up swings. Cricks his neck.
59
59
All is still, until the panicked face of a BURGLAR enters
frame. Being held by his collar.
BURGLAR
I'M SORRY MAN! I-I-I WON'T EVER DO
IT AGAIN! I'M SORR-OOOF!
BAM! - the leather fist of Nightwatcher slams Burglar back,
tripping over an A/C duct. He tries to shield himself-
REVERSE ANGLE - BOOM! - Nightwatcher lands in the FG.
IGHTWATCHER
Funny how you jerks don't care
about crossing the line `til
someone else does it... all over
yer HEAD!
Night hurls him back into a roof access door, denting it.
Raph's loving this. Walks to the Burglar and picks him up.
BURGLAR
(almost in tears)
I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY!!!
NIGHTWATCHER
Boy, oh boy, did YOU pick the wrong
night to be a criminal...
Night cocks his fist just as-
CASEY (O.S.)
Hey champ. You think you're being a
little rough on the guy?
ight slowly turns around. Menacing. Casey's taken aback.

CASEY
Are you that Nightwatcher fella?
(beat - unimpressed)
A little smaller than I expected.
RAPHAEL
(inside helmet)
Case? No way!
CASEY
(poking Raph with bat)
I'm talkin' to you, pal. You think
you own these rooftops? Well, lemme
teach you a thing'r two.
(takes out bat)
Class is Pain 101. Meet your
instructor... Casey Jones.
It's getting serious. Casey's bat is suddenly wrapped by
Night's CHAIN, and pulled down. Raph's visor flips up.
RAPHAEL
(GRINNING)
You keep on playing with fire,
little man, you might just get
burnt.
CASEY
Raph?! Is that you?!
(scans costume)
What-what are you doing?!
THINKS)
Are you pretending to be...
ON RAPH - His eyes look around for an answer. Nothing.
CASEY
Why would you-
(finally gets it)
-oh.
(a beat)
So that would mean...
(then REALLY gets it)
-OOOHHHHHH!
Raph smiles... the first genuine one he's had in a long time.
RAPHAEL
Yep.
IN BG - The Burglar tries to get away. Casey and Raph both
spy him. Look at each other. Mischievously grin as we-
DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSE ON - The panicked face of the Burglar. CAM ROTATES to
show him hanging upside-down. CAM WIDENS TO REVEAL he's bound
by chains and dangling from a street lamp!
CAM PANS UP THE BG BUILDING TO REACH - the two old friends
sit perched on a high tower, surrounded by gargoyles. They
blend right in. Both masks are off.
RAPHAEL
I dunno, I just got tired of the
"nothing". Sitting around waiting
for some disaster to cross our
paths. Of us battling Utroms and
Triceratons or any other friggin'
creature... when there was still
some guy gettin' mugged 100 feet
above the lair. Just didn't seem
right. `Specially if we had the
means to do somethin' about it.
Raph twirls a billy bat between his fingers. Stops.
RAPHAEL
And we did... but turns out I was
the only one who was willing to do
it, tho. So I just saved up, bought
and tweaked a sweet bike, fitted
the costume and began moonlighting.
BEAT)
Papers called me "The
Nightwatcher", so I went with it.
C
ASEY
"And a legend was born". So what
was your handle before that?
RAPHAEL
I kinda liked "The Midnight
Marauder"...
CASEY
(makes an "eww" face)
Stick with Nightwatcher, ninja boy.
(THEN)
The guys ever catch on?
RAPHAEL
Pfft. You kiddin' me? Leo's been
away for, like, forever. And the
other two are so wrapped up in that
party business they'd never notice.
BEAT)
So what about you? How's things
with April? Haven't seen ya's since
you two moved in together...
53.
CASEY
They're good... I guess. I dunno,
seems like all I do lately is just
make her upset. She used to laugh
so much... now it's mostly just
working all day, and coming home to
point out how I'm a screw up.
(points to hockey mask)
She doesn't like me doing this. And
I know she's pretending to not know
I'm out tonight. But she knows. And
she knows I know she knows.
(looks out at city)
Life just kinda got complicated
suddenly... y'know?
RAPHAEL
Yer tellin' me...
Casey looks at his old bud.
CASEY
Raph?
RAPHAEL
Yeah?
CASEY
Nice to see ya, man.
Raph acknowledges. The moment is broken by a HORRIBLE SHRIEK!
CASEY/RAPHAEL
What was that?!
They both spring to their feet and run to the back of the
roof. They hear the scream AGAIN off in the distance.
RAPHAEL
For old time's sake?
CASEY
What the shell.
ON RAPH - He stops, mid-replacement of his helmet.
RAPHAEL
(DISAPPROVING)
Bro. Seriously.
61
61
The two run and leap across the rooftops. Two vigilantes
searching for the source of the scream. They finally reach a
point where they don't hear it anymore.
EDGE OF ROOFTOP - They look out. Silent.
54.
CASEY
I think we lost it.
RAPHAEL
It's gotta be around here
somewhere.
SCREEEEECH!!! - A large VAMPIRE-LIKE CREATURE flies up from
the alley below and spreads its 30-foot wings!
CASEY/RAPHAEL
WAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!
It's about to attack when - THUNKA-THUNKA-THUNKA - it's
drilled with TRANQUILIZER DARTS from below! CHOOOM! - A
grappling hook winds around its feet. The Creature struggles
but is pulled down hard!
CASEY
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, RAPH?!
RAPHAEL
Did I mention we ran into a monster
last week?
CASEY
NO. NO, YOU KINDA FAILED TO TELL ME
ABOUT THAT ONE, BUDDY!
They inch closer to the edge. Peek over.
ON ALLEY - See the Four Generals putting a pounding on the
Creature. They subdue it with all their hardware. The Foot
stand guard, helping in the BG.
CASEY
The freakin' FOOT?!
(looks to Generals)
What about the walking statues?
Were you going to mention THOSE?!
RAPHAEL
Nope. Those are a first for me too.
(gets cocky)
We can take `em.
One of the generals effortlessly picks up a TRASH DUMPSTER
and wallops the Creature with one blow.
CASEY
On second thought...
The Generals put the Creature in a cell. Wheel it to a
TRANSPORTER VEHICLE as it drives away. They're just about to
leave when-
S
HINK! - Casey accidentally knocks a tiny piece of rock from
the ledge. It falls down - CLANG! - on a garbage can lid.

ON GENERALS - they turn around. Look up.
GENERAL GATO POV - He scans the two. Organic Earth-based.
ENERAL GATO
Witnesses.
Aguila snarls and fires the tranq gun! Raph dives in front of
Casey, taking the hit himself!
APHAEL
AAAARRGGH!!!!!
GENERAL AGUILA
(to Gato)
Fetch.
Gato SMILES as the other three board a Transport Vehicle.
CASEY
Not good.
Raph takes out NINJA SMOKE PELLETS and throws them on the
roof - FWOOM! When the smoke clears, Casey is standing there
alone! Raph is 10 feet away as Casey flinches and takes off
too.
NIGHTWATCHER
You ever heard of smoke pellets?
CASEY
Hey - you're the ninja, not me!
BOOM! - Gato lands up on the roof and quickly gives chase!
They can't lose him, even when they drop to street level.

62
Raph and Casey are tearing ass through the alleyways, trying
to escape the thing that's close on their tail.
CASEY
WHAT WERE THOSE THINGS, RAPH?!
Raph ignores him, looking for a street sign. Then he sees it -
56th Street.
RAPHAEL
Bingo.
Raphael quickly dashes left through TRAFFIC!
DOWN ALLEY BEHIND THEM - BOOM BOOM BOOM - We see Gato
bounding down the wall, almost in a four-legged run,
occasionally jumping off walls at incredible speeds! A true
jaguar. It leaps through the traffic as well.
C
56.
UNDER A BRIDGE - Raph points up and - CHOOP! - hits a remote
that lowers his MOTORCYCLE.
CASEY
What are we gonna do, Raph? WHAT
ARE WE GONNA-
(sees bike)
-hey, cool ride.
RAPHAEL
Hop on.
Raph leaves Gato in a cloud of dust... but not for long. Gato
clamors along... keeping up with the weaving bike! In the
fray, Casey looses his mask... as it gets trampled by Gato.
It's an insane chase, with Raph trying to lose him as Casey
swings his bat, trying to stave off the Stone General.
Suddenly - THUNK!
A circular OBSIDIAN BLADE lands in his wooden bat. He looks
at it.
CASEY
Um, Raph?
Raph sees the blade! They manage to switch positions in mid-
ride, with Casey driving and Raph in back. Raph throws kicks
and punches at their pursuer when he closes in.
The chase takes them to a PARKING GARAGE as they circle
upwards, Gato jumping from car to car, still on their tails!
ROOFTOP - They're trapped. He doesn't have a hope... aside
from jumping the bike to the next roof!
ASEY
T
hisiscrazythisiscrazythisiscrazy.
He lets out the clutch as they make the jump! WHAM! - Sparks
and crucial pieces fly off the undercarriage. They both look
back at Gato up and away at the top of the structure.
CASEY
SUCK ON THAT, ROCK FACE!
(Gato leaves edge)
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, PUNK!
...and then -thumpthumpthump- Gato JUMPS DOWN TOWARD THEM!
CASEY
Oh crap.
Casey guns it - BUT THE BIKE DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE - as Gato
is in mid-air, taking off. Casey grabs the weakening Raph and
drags him off.
C
57.
63
63
Gato lands and patrols the roof... almost SNIFFING them out.
Casey and Raph are barely hidden inside a rooftop shack.
Suddenly - BOOM! - Gato finds them. He tries to smash through
the steel door with his bare hands!
Raph leans his body into the door as a last ditch effort.
He's taking a pounding as the door is denting with each slam
by Gato. Casey tries to help as well.
Gato comes close to breaking in. Very tense. Then-
-the LIGHT on his exo-suit begins to STROBE. A signal. A
signal to return home. He surveys quickly... then runs off.
Casey and Raph fall out. Both shell-shocked.
ASEY
Okay, so it was great seein' ya
again, Raph.
(BEAT)
Raph?
ON RAPHAEL - He's got a dart in his shoulder, obsidian disks
stuck in his shell, and has collapsed unconscious.
CASEY
Gotta get you someplace safe, pal.
And then, then I need to go buy
some new undies.

Relatively peaceful. A few freighters off in the distance.
Tall dry grass rustles in the wind, as we see a-

clicking metal detector. Big goofy earphones cover his ears.
TREASURE HUNTER

The clicking intensifies. He follows the signal for twenty
feet. Drops to the ground and digs the sand...

..and comes up with a old unopened CAN OF SARDINES.
TREASURE HUNTER
Pfft. Figgers.
He turns to leave the beach.
TREASURE HUNTER
Lousy metal detector. "Happy
Anniversary" present, my big fat
keister.
He HURLS the can of sardines over his shoulder. Only, instead
of hearing a tiny SPLASH from it hitting the water... we hear
a snarling CRUNCH and TINNY-CHEWING.
The man stops in his tracks. He turns his head around.
CLOSE ON - Man's face, eyes wide in shock. Cam pulls back,
slowing just as the crown of a GNARLY SKULL crests the bottom
of the screen.
PTOOEY! - The tin "key" is spit back onto the sand. He bolts.
TREASURE HUNTER

Classic Diner design, Pete's Diner is closed for the evening.
The last light goes out.

Nightwatcher hears the scream. Runs to the source and looks

bolo chain and a power cable to form a ZIP LINE down the
street as-

Night tears down the streets and through back alleys. Leo
keeps up with him effortlessly, hurling an assortment of
THROWING STARS his way.
Night suddenly DASHES OUT into traffic! Jumping over passing
cars from roof to roof!
LEONARDO
Nice try, amateur.
Leo crosses the busy street while still maintaining his
secrecy. Zip lines through power lines, avoids an oncoming
bus, and flips back onto a cable.
e swings and manages to snag Nightwatcher in mid-leap!
LEONARDO
Oof! You're a heavy boy, aren't
you?
They both land on a fire escape, as Night clamors to the top.
Leo wastes no time in catching up.
79
79
The chase continues. Night giving it his all, and Leo keeping
up pretty easily. He throws Leo a pretty strong curveball,
and Leo barely recovers.
LEONARDO
Okay, someone's been training
pretty hard.
It begins to spit rain - and becomes a FRANK MILLER DOWNPOUR.

Night reaches an area that's a DEAD END. One side of the
buildings has a LARGE LETTERED SIGN facing away. Fills the
rooftop with silhouettes. No choice but to turn around...
...as Leo slows to a stop at the other end of the building.
LEONARDO
I want you to know that I
appreciate your intentions. But you
can't change the world like this.
INSIDE HELMET - All we hear is rain pouring. Raph can't hear
Leo - just sees him wagging his finger at him.
70.
NIGHTWATCHER
(to himself in helmet)
L
Oh god. He's lecturing.
EONARDO
(now audible)
...so I'm going to give you one
chance to just walk away and stop
this vigilante nonsense.
Leo unsheathes his two katanas. Raph can't hear him.
NIGHTWATCHER
(to himself in helmet)
Okay, Leo. Wanna play?
Nightwatcher drops TWIN BOLOS. He twirls them with
expertise... then motions for Leo to fight. Charge at each
other, running through the rain, weapons drawn.
They fight. Hard. And with expertise. Two masters duking it
out. It surprises Leo. It fills Night with more adrenaline.
There's a break. They circle like tigers. Renewing attacks.
Night knows every one of Leo's moves, and counters in turn.
LEONARDO
What? How did you-
...then he starts goading him on. Pushing Leo. Prodding.
Making him MAD. ...and then Leo fights back. HARD.
Night can't keep up. Leo uses every bit of his control,
restraint and expertise. He surgically slices the bind under
Night's helmet. He jumps on top of the vigilante.
LEONARDO
Goodnight, dark prince.
Leo UPPERCUTS Night, knocking his helmet off! His face
falls... IT'S RAPHAEL! Leo pales.
LEONARDO
R-raph?
(THINKS)
What?
But Raph doesn't feel like explaining. Refuses defeat.
RAPHAEL
AAAAAAAAGHH!!
He mule kicks Leo back. Leo tumbles back, still in shock.
They yell at each other through the pouring rain.
71.
RAPHAEL
You're so friggin' smug! You think
the world revolves around YOU,
dontcha? That we couldn't POSSIBLY
survive without the mighty and
powerful Leonardo to guide us
through our problems, HUH?!
(PACES)
Well, I gotta newsflash for ya - we
got along just fine without you.
LEONARDO
I was training! Training to be a
better leader! For you! Why do you
hate me for that?!
RAPHAEL
...and whoever said I wanted to be
led? I shoulda gone on that
training!
LEONARDO
Y
OU WEREN'T READY! You're impatient
and hot-tempered! And more
importantly... I'm better than you.
Raph stops in his tracks. Reaches behind his back... and
pulls out his TWIN SAIS. He flips them to the front.
RAPHAEL
Well, big brother, I'd have to
disagree with you on that one.
Raph takes a ready stance. Leo does too. And they fight.
Brother vs. brother. Katana vs. Sai. Technique vs. Heart.

In another part of the city, the Generals have caught the
Demon from Pete's Diner. As they carry him to the caravan,

They battle. In the end, Raph becomes an uncontrollable ball

It ends with Raph pinning Leo to the ground... holding a sai
MILLIMETERS FROM HIS EYEBALL!
Tense. Raph shakes. He looks like he's going to do it... then
stops. He collapses back. Almost ashamed of what he's done.
Leo just can't believe that Raph bested him. They pant
heavily. The rain dies down.
Raph RUNS AWAY, across a few rooftops. Away from his brother.
He suddenly STOPS and looks back at Leo, small in the
distance.
CLOSE ON LEO - A SHADOW suddenly falls over him. He looks up
to see the FOUR GENERALS surrounding him. He tries to fight
back... but is too wiped from Raph.
GATO POV - "reading" Leo on the ground. He frowns.
GENERAL GATO
It is neither monster nor human.
CLOSE ON AGUILA - He manages a small smile.
GENERAL AGUILA
Then he shall perfectly serve our
purposes... let us inform our
commander that the final creature
has been captured.
ON RAPH - He sees the commotion from afar... as Leo gets
TRANQUILIZED with the Generals' dart cannon.
RAPHAEL
LEO!!!
Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to the ground and
drive off. Raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and
catch his brother.
RAPHAEL
L
eo!!! Hang on!!
But the Caravan is too fast, and eventually loses Raph.
APHAEL
NOOOOOOOO!!!!
Raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof. The
sun begins to rise. He has to return to the sewer.
CUT TO:
DARK STORM CLOUDS gather over Winters Tower. A horrible
electrical storm is brewing.
We finally get to see how much of an ass-kicker Master
Splinter is. Same with April, who squares off against Karai.
They fight hard. April ends up cornered, about to be skewered
by her blade when...
-CLUNK! She wobbles and then passes out. When Karai falls out
of frame, she reveals CASEY JONES a hundred yards behind her
holding his HOCKEY STICK! April frowns.
APRIL
I had the situation under control.
CASEY
(SMIRKS)
You're welcome.
Mikey fights the most like Jackie Chan - comical maneuvers
backed by solid-hitting blows. Don uses his bo-staff in 1001
different ways, both offensively and defensively.
Casey is enjoying the hell out of it. High flying, adrenaline
rush. He even catches April checking him out, and vice versa.
April suddenly spots an opening to the front doors!
APRIL
Guys! Front door is open. Now!
They all charge the front door!

INTERS (V.O.)
There are things, Miss O'Neil, no
one could possibly know...
Camera pushes in on YAOTL and his Four Generals high on a
hill, surveying the action.
ON YAOTL - He takes off his helmet... IT'S WINTERS HIMSELF.
WINTERS (V.O.)
It was I who stood on that
battlefield all those years ago.
Winters/Yaotl looks out at the death and destruction. He
looks shocked, surprised.
A SHADOW falls over Winters body. He looks up - it's a
ceremonial SHAMAN from their enemies' camp.
WINTERS (V.O.)
And we had to pay a price.
The Shaman makes hand gestures, chanting. Winters is pulled
up in the air, and in a crackle of red electricity, we see
him become... grayer.
N GENERALS - Same electricity. Different effect. They
scream, slowly turned into STONE. Cracks form on their
bodies, light shooting out of it.
WINTERS (V.O.)
We were cursed that day. My four
comrades-in-arms were turned into
stone.

WINTERS(cont'd)
Cursed to live on this Earth...
immobile... yet fully aware at all
times to ponder the crimes we've
committed.
ON WINTERS - He stands on the battlefield. Alone. As he
walks, the CAM MOVES around him. During this, we X-DISSOLVE
BETWEEN A FEW SELECT TIME PERIODS between then and now.
WINTERS (V.O.)
My curse was to live... forever. To
feel the pain of losing love time
and time again. Of boredom. The
pain... of time.
ACK IN PRESENT DAY. Winters stops walking...
WINTERS
We were doomed to live this way
until, as the Shaman put it, "you
corrected the mistakes of your
past".
(gestures to the lobby)
That's what this is about. Penance,
Miss O'Neil. Finally getting a
chance to right our wrongs.
GENERAL AGUILA (O.S.)
Our master fails to include crucial
points in his tale.
ON SHADOWS - The Four Generals thump forward.
GENERAL AGUILA
He fails to discuss the petrified
agony of three thousand years.
GENERAL SERPIENTE

to merely blink an eye!
GENERAL GATO
Of watching the erosion of your own
body throughout centuries.
GENERAL AGUILA
So, while our great leader basked
in the warmth of the sun and the
glory of fresh air... we rotted in
the stone hell that lasted
throughout Wmillennia.
INTERS
My brothers, I-
GENERAL AGUILA
WE ARE NO BROTHERS TO YOU! Our
brotherhood was broken the day that
you condemned us to this eternity.
(
86.
ON DOORS - CAM PULLS BACK ALONG DOORS as each one is barely
forced open and dozens of Foot Ninjas pile in the lobby!
Karai comes to FG of group. Surveys as the scene continues.
GENERAL GATO
And now, our Master has tired of
feeding on the nectar of life. Of
loving his entire life. Of FEELING.
(gestures to portal)
So he prefers to end it all. End
HIS "misery" at the expense of
ours.
Aguila walks to the cells. The portal writhes in the bg,
sinking into the floor.
GENERAL AGUILA
But thanks to his cunning, his
technology, we are now capable of
LIVING... we have now become-
(close, creepy)
- gods.
GENERAL SERPIENTE
And we shall finish what we began
all those years ago. We will
finally have our victory.
GENERAL GATO
Even with one monster still free,
the curse can never be broken!
GENERAL AGUILA
(to Winters)
Join us. Join us Yaotl, and live a
life eternal with us at your side!
ON WINTERS - He waits. A beat.
WINTERS
Never. This was our opportunity! We
were wrong! Don't you understand?!
GENERAL AGUILA
NO! YOU WERE WRONG.
BEAT)
And you are weak.
GENERAL AGUILA
(to Karai)
Destroy them.
Karai sees Winters' condition. Clearly getting screwed by the
very beings who have been nothing but hostile toward her and
her Foot Clan. She suddenly GESTURES WITH HER HANDS -
military/ninja style.
87.
APRIL
What does THAT mean?
KARAI
It means we're going to help you.
WIDER - 40 Foot Ninja disperse around out of the building,
leaving Karai and 4 Foot Ninja behind.
KARAI
My soldiers will find the
thirteenth monster. And you will
bring it back here. Hurry - we
don't have much time.
Karai runs off. April looks over at Winters. He nods, still
hurting. April takes off after Karai, leaving Casey behind
with the Four Foot. They run out into the garden, just in
time to see the other Foot disappear into the night.
CASEY
I got shotgun!
BACK ON GENERALS - They move toward Winters! The Turtles
quickly look at one another. Know what they have to do.
They all leap in the way, standing between Winters and his
backstabbing Generals.
Aguila moves forward to Leo. Raph steps in beside him,
defiant. Then Mikey. Then Don.
RAPHAEL
If you mess with one of us-
(looks around)
-you mess with all of us.
Aguila smiles at their chutzpa.
GENERAL AGUILA
Challenge accepted.
97
The Portal worsens behind them. Sound and sight. The Eight 97
are ready to fight.
...and the fight BEGINS! The Turtles leap, pounce and strike
with all the exuberance and intensity they've ever had.
Winters moves to help the Turtles.
Suddenly a WALKING STICK across his chest stops him!
SPLINTER
They must face them alone. As
brothers.
Winters debates it in his head for a beat - WHAM! - a
tentacle from the portal slams down next to him!
88.
WINTERS
Alright. We have more important
things to do!
ON PORTAL - A small DEMON makes its way out of the portal!
Winters runs and flips through the air and then CLOBBERS IT
with his bare hands, sending it back down!
He lands on the other side.
WINTERS
Help me push the cells into the
portal!
Splinter does as the two masters also manage to lay some
smackdown on any emerging creature out of the portal.
CUT TO:

CASEY (O.S.)
This has got to be the suckiest
vehicle to save the world with.
- as the Cowabunga Carl van roars around the corner. Tinkling
musical notes chime along with the speed. Appropriately lame
and embarrassing.
INSIDE VAN - Casey drives, as April, Karai and Four Foot are
crammed in the back. Awkward silence.
CASEY
So... anybody from out of town?
W
E BEGIN TO INTERCUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LOBBY FIGHT,
AND CASEY/APRIL MONSTER CHASE...
LOBBY - The combatants all pair off for their final battle.
Utter commotion. Mikey is paired with Serpiente.
Donnie is paired with the General Mono. He uses his quick
speed and expert staff against the hammer-weilding Statue.
Leo fights with Gato. He can't dodge him. He's too fast. Leo
lands a lucky blow, but Gato recoils - BOOM! Leo's knocked
shell-first into a large GLASS DISPLAY CASE filled with
swords and bladed weapons of all kinds.
LEONARDO
Come to daddy.
MOMENTS LATER - SMASH! - Leo steps out, ready for action.
Strapped with a dozen swords tucked all over his body. He
pulls them out randomly as needed throughout the fight.
C
C
89.
Raph and Aguila duke it out in and around the MONSTER CELLS.
It's a Jackie Chan-inspired sequence, where they have to be
aware of their environment to avoid defeat.
RAPHAEL
Sensei! How you guys doing?!
ON SPLINTER AND WINTERS - The portal is pulling the cells in.
About five more to go. Splinter also flips around and takes
out another demon trying to escape. Splinter actually seems
to be having FUN.
SPLINTER
Wonderful, my son. WONDERFUL!
BACK WITH APRIL AND CASEY - Rush the streets of NYC.
KARAI
My troops have located the final
monster. At the harbor docks.
ASEY
Oh, I got this one covered.
Casey GUNS IT for the pier, music tinkling. CAM ZOOMS AHEAD
THROUGH THE STREETS until it reaches the pier. CAM CRANES
over the harbor warehouses until we see -
- the 13th monster! Looks like a land-locked GIANT CROCODILE.
It appears unconscious - a hundred or so TRANQ DARTS sticking
out of it's back. The Van pulls onto the scene.
I
NSIDE THE VAN - Everyone is in shock. The ninjas look at
each other.
ASEY
Huh. Now there's somethin' you
don't see every day...
They pile out of the van.
CASEY
(off of monster)
Well, I guess we have to figure out
how to get handsome here back to
Winters' Tower.
KARAI
We should tie it to the van and
drag it back.
CASEY
Wow. You're... hard core.
ON CREATURE - A Foot Ninja stands next to the lifeless body.
As he turns his head he doesn't see THE CREATURE'S EYE OPEN!
90.
WIDER - The creature stands up as everyone turns to see. The
creature DOG SHAKES his hide, sending the tranq darts flying
everywhere! They slam into the walls like shrapnel.
ON FOOT - As they dive out of the way. One gets hit with a
dart in the chest. Looks down. Passes out.
CASEY
Incoming!
ON VAN - As they open the doors to act as shields as - THUNKA
THUNK THUNK - darts stick in the door!
ON CREATURE - He's now standing... and dying to chase
something. It GROWLS/SCREAMS as they all pile into the van!
Casey immediately throws it in reverse and starts peeling
back on the pier, barely staying out of the clutches of the
creature smashing the pier in front of them. Get to the end
and spin the vehicle around.
APRIL
FAST! GO FAST NOW!!!
Casey guns it, the 12-foot creature mere inches away!
STARS IN SKY - Karai sees the stars are slowly moving out of
alignment. Losing time fast.
BACK IN LOBBY - CRANE DOWN on Winters and Splinter. On the
last full cell.
ON PORTAL - A pair of LARGE EYES are threatening to come out.
In the BG, dozens of winged DEMONS fly around inside.
LEONARDO
They better hurry with that last
monster!
RAPHAEL
I'm sure my man Casey's got it all
under control...
LEONARDO
That's what I'm afraid of.
BACK WITH VAN - CLOSE ON CASEY'S FACE - As he's screaming his
guts out.
CASEY
I GOTTA TELL YA... I'M, UH, I'M
STILL NOT SURE THAT THIS WAS THE
BEST IDEA!!!!
WIDER - We see that he's on top of the Van, acting as LIVE
BAIT to attract the creature! It's working too! The creature
pounces along like an awkward greyhound run. April drives.
R
91.
Casey is throwing SPORTS EQUIPMENT at it from his large
hockey bag. The creature is catching and eating it all.
INSIDE VAN - Casey slips in.
APRIL
What are you doing in here?!
CASEY
Ran outta food.
They all look out the back window as the creature pounds
closer and closer...
BACK IN LOBBY - The Turtles and Generals are at a standstill.
Turtles all get thrown into a pile between the Generals.
APHAEL
Listen. I'm the last guy to sound
like a TV cartoon, but I think we
need to work together.
MICHAELANGELO
Teamwork. The more you know...
Don clocks Mikey behind the head.
LEONARDO
(TEASING)
Why Raph, no solo act tonight?
Raph grins. They stand, backs to back... finally as a TEAM.
They trust one another, and their efficiency shows.
ON PORTAL - More tentacles begin to come out. More claws
surround the surface edges.
ON TMNT - The music swells. The brothers act and think as
one. The way they should. They way they will from now on.
ON SPLINTER - As cam PUSHES IN, he stands up. Seeing his
sons. As one. As BROTHERS. He smiles.
SPLINTER
Yes. Yes, my sons.
The Generals can't keep up. It's enough to distract them to
make mistakes the TMNT take advantage of.
ON WINTERS - Sees the portal light beginning to SHRINK!
Because of the TMNT's moves, the Generals are now on the
precipice of the Portal, being pulled back. They struggle to
stand.
The brothers look at each other. The place is violent with a
whirlwind and screaming Monsters.
T
92.
RAPHAEL
So who wants ta call it a day?
LEONARDO
I'm in.
DONATELLO
Affirmative.
MICHAELANGELO
Roger dodger, dude.
The
TMNT launch into their FINAL ATTACK - perfectly in synch
and
take out each of the Generals, knocking them back into
the
PORTAL! They're plucked out of mid-air by cloudy tendrils
and
pulled back!
The Turtles collapse onto the floor, back to the portal.
Silent. Splinter runs over to them.
SPLINTER
My sons, I am so proud of you all.
Then - BOOM! - the Generals' ARMS slam onto the ridge of the
portal - BEGINNING TO CLIMB OUT! The Turtles jump back.
TURTLES
WAAAHHHHH/OHMIGOD!/WHOOAAA!!!
GENERAL AGUILA
Silly children. We are immortals
made of stone! The Earth has only
BEGUN to feel our wrath!
The brothers are screwed. They can't stop the Generals. Until-
BEHIND TURTLES - Glowing headlights grow larger. Closer. As -
KERSMASH!!! The Van flies through the lobby, musical chime
and all, being trailed by the Creature! April clips a corner
as the vehicle spins out of the path.
he Creature tries to stop, but can't on the marble floor. It
falls, sliding, clicking its claws trying to stop!
WINTERS
LOOK OUT!
Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles out of way as the
Creature flies in and knocks the Generals back into the
Portal! The Cloud Tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back
into the Portal!
ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle.
ON PORTAL - It begins to close. The Generals struggle to get
out, only now, we see they are HUMAN... their curse broken...
and an eternity of pain and suffering ahead of them.
93.
Aguila tries to fight his way out of the portal.
GENERAL AGUILA
YOU CANNOT DEFEAT US! WE-
WHAM! - Raph and Leo team-roundhouse him back into oblivion!
RAPHAEL
I thought he'd never shut up.
WIDER - The portal EXPLODES in a upwards funnel. Silence.
MICHAELANGELO
HOLY CRAP!!!
RAPHAEL
WE DID IT!
TURTLES
YEAH! WHOOHOO! WE DID IT!
The brothers high five one another. Splinter smiles proud.
ON VAN - Dusty and smoking. The door clangs open. Casey piles
out. Karai comes next and accidentally FALLS on Casey in a
very compromising position! She slyly smiles. April falls out
last beside them.
CASEY
(caught - looks at both)
Oh. I, uh -
HUHN! - Casey tosses Karai off of him. April's eye cocks.
APRIL
Don't try to tell me for one second
that you didn't enjoy tha-
Casey just grabs her, cutting her off and they kiss. Like
they should have been kissing all along.
They stop. Noses close. Smile. They pull apart, revealing
MIKEY standing there. Watching them all gooey-eyed.
MICHAELANGELO
AWWWWWW....
Raph and Leo look at each other. A beat. Then hug. Brothers
again. Dialogue would just ruin this moment.
Splinter walks over to them. CAM ADJUSTS to show Karai and
the Foot Ninja standing there. Silence. Finally, Karai steps
forward -
KARAI
You are every bit the warriors I
was informed you were. You have
passed.
94.
ON TMNT - they're confused.
LEONARDO
Passed what?
RAPHAEL
You know us?
KARAI
I've known OF you for some time.
(beat, to Leo's question)
Savor your victory tonight. For
soon we will have further business
together.
SPLINTER
What kind of business?
KARAI
The kind that involves familiar
faces from your past...
ON TURTLES - They all look at each other.
RAPHAEL
She doesn't mean...
They look back - and see Karai and the Foot have DISAPPEARED.
Raph looks over at WINTERS. He's hunched over in the corner.
Can't tell what's going on. They walk over slowly.
RAPHAEL
Winters?
ON WINTERS - Looks like he's sobbing. They get concerned.
Then the sobs turn to LAUGHING. He stands up. His hand is
spotted red with his M
own BLOOD from a cut on his cheek.
ICHAELANGELO
I'm never usually that happy to be
bleeding.
DONATELLO
You would be if you were an
immortal who couldn't bleed for
three thousand years...
Winters looks at all the Turtles.
WINTERS
Thank you. Thank you from the
bottom of my heart. You've made a
very old man, very very happy.
MICHAELANGELO
So, um, what happens now?
R
C
95.
ON WINTERS - He just SMILES. Content. Finally at peace. As he
ages thousands of years in front of us... eventually turning
to DUST and blowing away.
MICHAELANGELO
Okay... just a little bit creepy.
(SNEEZES)
Oh gawd. I think he's in my n-n-
ATTCHOOOOO!! OH GROSS!!!
CAM PULLS BACK, out of the building, onto the street. See the
destruction. The clearing skies. THE SUNRISE.
UT TO:
Mikey and Don are on the rooftops. Leo and Raph join them on
top. Leo and Raph have an aside to themselves.
RAPHAEL
So we're cool with the whole
Nightwatcher thing?
LEONARDO
Yeah, we're cool. Our secret, bro.
(checks for clear coast)
You got rid of the stuff, right?
QUICK SHOT - Nightwatcher's gear burning in a barrel.
EONARDO
What about the bike, tho?
RAPHAEL
(discreet/confessional)
Okay, so I couldn't exactly destroy
the bike.
(BEAT)
Let's just say it's in good hands.
LEONARDO
What do you mean?
RAPHAEL
I mean, it's in good hands.
LEONARDO
(thinks, then realizes)
Oh, you didn't.
Raph sheepishly shrugs as we-
SMASH CUT TO:
102
102
CASEY (O.S.)
WHAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
As Casey roars down the street on the black motorcycle of
Nightwatcher, barely able to hang on.
97.
He drives past WINTERS TOWER - now being converted to a
NATURAL SCIENCES AND HISTORY MUSEUM.
103
103
A HITCHHIKER THUMB comes into frame. Casey stops his bike.
WIDER - It's April. She smiles. Casey hands her a helmet.
APRIL'S POV INSIDE HELMET - We see a small DIAMOND RING taped
to the visor. She takes it off. Beaming. Models it on her
hand. She leans forward.
APRIL
...yes.
She wraps her arms around his waist and holds tight for the
adventures that await...
CAM FOLLOWS for a beat, then rises up the buildings to-
104
104
All four turtles are horsing around. They get geared up...
and head off for a game of NINJA TAG.
The boys run, hoot and holler as they fly high on the
rooftops.
RAPHAEL (V.O.)
So what makes a family? Personally,
it's more than sharing a roof or a
bathroom. It's sharing life... My
father taught me that, and I think
it's pretty much true... y'know,
provided that you don't kill each
other in the process. Or that no
one touches your stuff. Or makes
loud noises when you're trying to
sleep. Or...
They run close to the camera, once again, a family.
RAPHAEL (V.O.)
Hey, nobody said it was easy.
And as RAPHAEL and LEONARDO leap toward camera, we-
CUT TO BLACK:
THE END
