                    In the year 2000, a documentary 
                    film crew followed a number of High 
                    School Students through their 
                    senior year at Greenbelt High.*

      We see a MONTAGE of moments from a typical high school day.  *

      Note: All the footage we see in this series (unless otherwise *
      noted) has been shot by our documentary crew.  What we are *
      watching, in other words, is not a scripted show, but a *

                    So it s 2010.  I m living in D.C.  
                    I m a lawyer.  And I work for 
                      Congressman Taub from 
                      Massachusetts.  He s the leader of 
                    the House Finance Committee, and 
                    right now we re trying to pass a 
                    banking regulation bill that I 
                    helped write.

                    Wow.  That s right, I was going to 
                    be a scientist.  But then, of

      She gets up, hugs The Falcon.  The Falcon glances at the 
      camera.  They sit.

                    Fifty, I think.

                    Right.  He got that eye twitch.  
                    Had it for the next three years.

      Brenda s Blackberry beeps.  She looks at it, quickly replies 
      to a text, puts the phone down.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    So, you live in New York now,

      He hands Jackie a glass.  She takes a sip.

                                  JACKIE FOX
                    Mmm.  Peppery.

                    I knew Anders, sure.  He was cute. *
                    But he was crazy about Brenda.  
                    Brenda, Brenda, Brenda.

      From her tone this is clearly still a source of tension.  
      Anders takes Jackie s hand, trying to smooth things over.*

                                  FILMMAKER*
                    So, Jackie, what happened?  Last 
                    time we talked to you, you were 
                    going to go to Hollywood to be an 
                    actress.

      Jackie s smile freezes a little.

                                  JACKIE FOX
                    Well ... I tried.

      Suddenly he is SURROUNDED by some JOCKS.  They take his

      Then Steven Foster, 18, steps in, grabs the backpack.  Steven *
      mad dogs one of the jocks, and they back off.  Steven hands 
      Kenneth s bag to him.

      GROUP INTERVIEW, GREENBELT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY (2000)

      Our ten subjects are sitting together.  We focus on Kenneth 
      Finley, sitting next to his friend, Steven Foster.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    I don t know.  Everybody else seems 
                    to know exactly what they want to 
                    be.  I just -- career-wise, who 
                    knows?  But I d like to have a 
                    family, to get married you know. 
                    And then -- have a bunch of kids, 
                    right, babe?

      The camera finds DAWN BARBUSO, 18,  The Punk  sitting next to 
      him.  She is the opposite of Kenneth, the kind of girl who 
      smokes Marlboro Reds and gets in fights.  Dawn gives Kenneth 
      a skeptical smile.  Kenneth beams at her.

                    Yeah, not really.  I mean, I have

      CAROLINE CHUNG, 28, and her son TOM, 9, arrive for a 
      parent/teacher conference.  Kenneth Finley stands up from 
      behind his desk to greet them.

      Kenneth and Tom go through an elaborate high-five ritual.  
      It s clear Tom loves his teacher.

      We JUMP AHEAD.  Kenneth sits across from Caroline and Tom. *

                    So Tom s doing great, really great.  
                    But I ve noticed his work has 
                    dropped off in the last few months.

      Caroline glances at the camera, uncomfortable.

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                    Tommy, do you want to go color?

      Tom goes to the far end of the room.  Caroline decides to be 
      honest in front of the camera.                                    Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)24.


                                  CAROLINE CHUNG (CONT D)
                    It s this thing with his dad -- I 
                    mean, wanting to know who his dad 
                    is.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    Sure.  Now on the phone you said 
                    you d called the father, and he was 
                    coming to town.

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                    Yeah, he said he d be here on 
                    Monday, but he hasn t called.
                    This whole  meeting his father  
                    thing has been so stressful for 
                    Tom.  For both of us.  

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    I bet.

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                    Between you and me, if Tom hadn t 
                    started asking, I probably wouldn t 
                    have called.  I mean, it s not 
                    really fair -- to drop this on the 
                    guy after all these years.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    Well, he ll do the right thing.  
                    Trust me.  Any man who finds out he 
                    has a son is going to drop 
                      everything.  I would.

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                    I got news for you, Kenneth.  Not 
                    every man is as sweet as you.

      They share a moment.  It s clear Caroline is crazy about 
      Kenneth.  But Kenneth is oblivious.*

                    tell me -- what s his name?  The 
                    father.

      Beat.  Caroline is suddenly uncomfortable.

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                          (squirrely)
                    I told you that, didn t I?

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    No.  Every time I ask you change 
                    the subject.                                                                                    25.

                          (deep breath)
                    It s Steven Foster, from high 
                    school.

      Kenneth goes white.

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG (CONT D)
                    Kenneth?  Are you okay?

                          (no)
                    Yeah.  Absolutely.

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                    No.  You re upset.  That s why I 
                    never --

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    You know -- I ve got -- another 
                      conference, so I have to -- but if 
                    you need anything -- or Tom needs 
                    anything, you know, call me.

                    Great to see you.  Bye Tom.

      He hurries out.  Off Caroline: what just happened?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Brenda is on her computer.  Ben Watts comes in.

                    Hey.

      Brenda jumps a little bit.

                                  BEN WATTS (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  Just thought you should 
                    know, the vote s starting soon.

      Brenda stands, puts on her jacket.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    Great.  Thanks.

                    Hey, do you wanna be set up -- on a

                                  BEN WATTS
                    You know -- a date.  You go out, 
                    have a few drinks, some dinner.  I 
                    have a friend.  Really nice guy.  I 
                    think you d like him.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    No.  I m, thanks though, but I m --  
                    we have the regulatory hearings 
                    coming up, and I just bought the

      As they re talking the camera moves behind Brenda s desk.  
      There is a PHOTO of Anders, 28, on the screen.  It s his 
      WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT.  We see Anders and Jackie Fox, the 
      smiling, happy couple.  We realize Brenda has been Googling 
      Anders.  Clearly, Brenda isn t as over Anders as she claims.

      Brenda notices where the camera is focused.  She panics a 
      little, comes over and hurriedly turns it off.                                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)31.


      She stands there, self-conscious, aware that something 
      private and secret about her hopes and dreams has been 
      revealed.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO (CONT D)
                          (to Ben)
                    You know what?  I ll go --  The 
                    date.  Set it up.

                                  BEN WATTS
                    Cool.  Mickey s a great guy.  
                    You re gonna like him.

      Off Brenda, flushed.  This is a big step for her.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Kenneth sits at a desk across from JAY ROSCOE, 37, who holds

                    Okay, Mr. Finley.  I ll need to 
                    take a full medical history and get 
                    a sperm sample.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    Of course.

                    Any sexually transmitted diseases?

                                  JAY ROSCOE
                    We ll test for that.  How about 
                    your family?  Any history of heart

                    My mom s alive -- my dad, uh, died

                    No.

                                  JAY ROSCOE
                    Okay.  The bathroom s down the

      He takes the specimen cup, looking self-conscious.

      It is Dawn s BABY SHOWER.  Food and drinks have been laid 
      out.  Dawn is there with SEVEN other WOMEN, all standing,

                    Sounds really dangerous over there.  
                    I don t know how you do it.

      For a moment Dawn looks like she might cry.  Then Caroline 
      Chung knocks and enters.  She is carrying a big box with a 
      bow.

                    I don t know.  He was supposed to 
                    be here.

      The Falcon is standing over the dip.  He s holding a beer and 
      looking uncomfortable.  Caroline sees him.

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                    Falcon?

      Caroline studies The Falcon, considering.

                    Yeah, he said he was coming to 
                    town, but I haven t heard from him.  
                    You guys are still friends, right?

                                  THE FALCON
                    Yeah, but --

                    The whole -- baby thing.*

      Caroline looks around for the camera.  We are watching from a 
      distance.  She leans in close to The Falcon, talking quietly, 
      but we can still hear her.

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                    Listen to me, little man.  I have a 
                      nine-year-old boy who thinks he s 
                    meeting his daddy this week.  So if 
                    you want to walk out of here with 
                    your balls, you will call Steven 
                    Foster on the phone right now and 
                    tell him to get his ass on an 
                    airplane tonight.  Do you hear me?

      The Falcon nods.  Now he really wishes he hadn t come to the 
      shower.  Behind them, Dawn picks up her glass, taps a spoon 
      against it to get everybody s attention.                                    Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)44.

                    It s -- you know, three more 
                    months.  I can t sleep on my back 
                    and I have to pee every five

                    But you hope you won t have to do *
                    it alone forever.*

      Beat.  Dawn nods, calming down.  But we see from Caroline s *
      face that she s losing that hope.*

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Steven is drinking coffee at the kitchen table.  His mother, *
      JOYCE, is cooking eggs. *

                                  JOYCE FOSTER*
                    So?  Are you going to look for a *
                    job?*                                    Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)45.


                                  STEVEN FOSTER*
                    I told you, I don t know how long *
                    I m staying.*

                                  JOYCE FOSTER*
                    You should call your friend *
                    Kenneth.  He teaches at the *
                      elementary school.  Teacher.  Now *
                    that s a respectable career.*

                                  STEVEN FOSTER*
                    We re not really friends anymore.*

                                  JOYCE FOSTER*
                    Why not?*

      Beat.  Steven doesn t want to get into it.*

                                  JOYCE FOSTER (CONT D)*
                          (beat, cooking)*
                    Well, your father would like it if *
                    you visited.  *

      Steven glances at the camera.*

                                  STEVEN FOSTER*
                    Mom.*

                                  JOYCE FOSTER*
                    What?  It s only about a ninety *
                    minute drive.  You could be there *
                    by lunch.*

                                  STEVEN FOSTER*
                    I m not -- that s not why I came.*

                                  JOYCE FOSTER*
                    Well, what are you going to do?  *
                    Hate him for the rest of your life? *

      Steven doesn t respond.  There is clearly something weighing *
      heavily on his mind.*

                                  STEVEN FOSTER*
                    Mom, do you think I d be a good *
                    father?*

      Joyce turns on him, instantly suspicious.*

                                  JOYCE FOSTER*
                    What s going on?*

      Steven glances at the camera.*                                    Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)46.


                                  STEVEN FOSTER*
                    Nothing.  I m just saying -- *
                      hypothetically?*

                                  JOYCE FOSTER*
                      Hypothetically?  There s no such *
                    thing as a hypothetical child.*

                                  STEVEN FOSTER*
                    Forget it.*

      Beat.  His mother flips the eggs.*

                                  JOYCE FOSTER*
                    You don t have a job.  *

                                  STEVEN FOSTER*
                    I have a job.*

                                  JOYCE FOSTER*
                    A real job -- with a future.  You *
                    were such a smart kid.  And now you *
                    live in a hut.  Promise me you *
                    won t have children until after you *
                    grow up.*

      Off Steven: we can see this resonate.  She s right.  He s in *
      no position to be a father to anyone.*

                                  JOYCE FOSTER (CONT D)*
                    And call Kenneth.  You re too *
                    isolated.  Whatever happened, just -*
                    - get over it.*

      Off Steven: it s not that easy.*

                                                                            CUT TO:*


      Brenda sits alone at a table.  She is dressed for a date.  
      She looks around nervously.  From her face we can tells she s 
      thinking this was a bad idea.  She stands, grabs her coat, 
      just as her BLIND DATE, MICKEY COOPER, 32, approaches.

      Mickey is not a stud.  He s the kind of guy your cousin sets 
      you up with.

                                  MICKEY COOPER
                    Brenda?

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                          (busted)
                    Mickey?

                                  MICKEY COOPER
                    Yeah, are you -- were you leaving?

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                          (lying)
                    No, I just -- I was going outside 
                    for a cigarette.

                                  MICKEY COOPER
                    Oh.  You re a smoker?

      Brenda realizes she doesn t have an endgame to this lie.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    No.  You caught me.  I was leaving.

      She sees his face fall, feels bad.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO (CONT D)
                    But let s, let s sit down.

      Mickey glances at the camera.                                                                                    48.


                                  MICKEY COOPER
                    We don t, you know -- have to.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    No -- I just -- there was a work 
                    thing, but it can wait.

      They sit, off to a bad start.  Beat.  They look at each other 
      uncomfortably.

                                  MICKEY COOPER
                          (re: camera crew)
                    So, what s with the --

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    Oh, it s -- like a documentary 
                    about my high school class -- a 
                    where are they now kind of thing.

                                  MICKEY COOPER
                    Cool.  Cool.  I don t watch a lot 
                    of TV.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    Yeah.  Me either.  You know -- 
                    work.

                                  MICKEY COOPER
                    Yeah, so -- you do a lot of these?  
                    Blind dates?

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    Me?  No.  I don t really -- date.

      Mickey takes an olive from a bowl on the table, pops it in 
      his mouth. 

                                  MICKEY COOPER
                    I hear you.  I had a coffee date 
                    with a cackler last week.  

      As he s talking Mickey spits the olive pit into his hand, 
      puts it on the table.  Brenda stares at the pit, as it 
      glistens black against the white table cloth.

                                  MICKEY COOPER (CONT D)
                    You know, like the Wicked Witch of 
                    the West.  I ll get you my pretty 
                    and your little dog, too.  I mean, 
                    wow, you know?  I tried not to make 
                    her laugh, but -- I m just 
                    naturally funny.                                    Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)49.


                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                          (trying to be supportive)
                    Yeah.

      Mickey chews another olive, puts the pit next to the first.

                                  MICKEY COOPER*
                    So here s the deal with me.  I m a 
                    lawyer -- corporate.  I like 
                    musicals and movies with Catherine 
                    Zeta Jones.  I drive a Prius, 
                    recycle.  I go to the gym, but I m 
                    not, you know, a fanatic about it.  
                    I like to read -- but not books, 
                      magazines, sometimes a newspaper.  
                    And, honestly, I have a small 
                    penis, but I know how to use it.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                          (stunned)
                    Wow, that s --

      Mickey lays a third olive pit next to the other two.

                                  MICKEY COOPER
                    What about you?

      Beat.  Brenda thinks about spending the next ninety minutes 
      of her life with this guy.  She can t do it.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    Actually, you know what?  I m gonna 
                    --

      She stands and gets her coat.

                                  MICKEY COOPER
                          (realizing)
                    Oh, well, uh --

      He starts to stand awkwardly.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    No, don t get up.  This work thing, 
                    sorry.  It was really nice to meet 
                    you.

                                  MICKEY COOPER
                    Yeah, uh --

      Brenda flees.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                    Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)50.



      Kenneth sits at the bar.  There is an empty glass in front of 
      him.  Kenneth is a little drunk, and clearly dejected.  He 
      stares past the camera, lost in thought.  The BARTENDER puts 
      another drink in front of Kenneth.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  That s 
                    -- you re very kind.  It s a big *
                    day for me.  Big day.*

                                  BARTENDER*
                          (reluctantly)*
                    Why s that?*

                                    KENNETH FINLEY*
                    Because today I learned I can t *
                    have children.*

      The bartender doesn t know what to say.  He pushes Kenneth s *
      money back to him.*

                                  BARTENDER*
                    That s rough.  This one s on me.*

                                    KENNETH FINLEY*
                    Thank you.  You re -- very kind.*

      Kenneth studies his drink.  There is a moment where it seems 
      like Kenneth may finally succumb to all the disappointment he 
      has had in the last ten years.  But then, slowly, he starts 
      nodding, working himself out of his funk.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY (CONT D)
                    No.  You know what?  This is good.  
                    It s good.  Wow.  What a downer I 
                    am, huh?  Whew.  Sorry.  I just got 
                    a little -- 
                          (shakes it off)
                    No.  This is great actually -- not 
                    being able to have kids -- because 
                    now I can really focus on my 
                    students, really be there for them.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    54.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY (CONT D)
                    You know?
                          (beat)
                    Okay.  Good.
                          (raises his glass)
                    Cheers.

      Steven Foster walks in.  He has just had his run-in with 
      Caroline.

                                  STEVEN FOSTER
                          (calling to bartender)
                    I m gonna need about six ounces of 
                    tequila.  Stat.

      Kenneth and Steven recognize each other.  All Kenneth s 
      positivity deflates, punctured by fear and, surprisingly, 
      anger.

                                  STEVEN FOSTER (CONT D)
                          (fuck)
                    Oh.  Hey.  I, uh ...

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    You.

      Kenneth stands.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY (CONT D)
                    This is all your fault!

      Kenneth PUNCHES Steven.  Not hard, not expertly, but hits him 
        nonetheless.  Steven staggers back.  Kenneth grabs his 
      bicycle helmet and runs out.

      Off Steven, stunned.

      GROUP INTERVIEW, HIGH SCHOOL, AUSTIN, TX - DAY (2000)

      Our teenage documentary subjects are gathered together.  We 
      focus on Steven, 18.  He is wearing a suit.

                                  STEVEN FOSTER
                    I just think life is what you make 
                    of it, you know?  Your attitude.  
                    My dad always says there s nothing 
                    in life you can t achieve through 
                    hard work.  And I agree.  It s 
                    about setting a goal and going for 
                    it.  You know?                                                                                    55.

                      University he was in the top of his 
                    class.  He became an editor at the 
                    school paper and ran for student 
                      government.  Then, on October 16th,

                    New allegations and new arrests 
                    today in the case against the Texas 
                    energy giant Enron.

      We see News Footage of the PERP WALK, as Enron executives are 
      led into the courthouse in handcuffs.  Among them are KEN 
      LAY, JEFFREY SKILLING and Steven s FATHER.

                    Steven s father had been a top 
                    executive at Enron.  He was 
                    arrested and charged with seventeen 
                    counts of fraud.

      We see a STILL PHOTO from this period, of Steven on campus at 
      Brown.  He is sitting on the lawn as kids play and laugh 
      around him.  We PUSH IN on the photograph and see Steven on 
      his phone, caught in mid-argument.  There is a look of 
      desperation on his face.

                    As a result of his father s arrest, 
                    all of the family s assets were 
                    frozen.  Steven was forced to drop 
                    out of school.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    It appears that thousands of 
                    Americans have lost their 
                      retirement savings in the company s 
                    collapse.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Steven sits in the booth, lost in thought.  He looks spooked.  
      We see that this  freedom  is a fantasy.  Steven is a man on 
      the run, a man who doesn't want to face the truth about 
      himself, who won't let other people get close in case they 
      see him for who he really is.  Deep down, Steven Foster is 
      afraid to be a father because he s afraid to be his father.

                                  FILMMAKER (O.S.)
                    Steven.  What happened to Kenneth s 
                    dad -- it wasn t your fault.  You 
                    know that right?

      Steven won t look at us.  It s clear he s carried around this 
      weight for years, the feeling that his whole privileged 
      childhood came at the expense of thousands of innocent 
      people.  The feeling that Steven is somehow complicit in the 
      suffering his dad caused.  After all, who pays for the sins 
      of fathers if not their children?  

      For a moment Steven looks like he ll open up, but then --

                                  JACKIE FOX (O.S.)
                    Steven?

      Steven looks up.  Jackie is standing there, dressed to kill.  
      She s with three GIRLFRIENDS.

                                  JACKIE FOX (CONT D)
                    Wow.  Twice in one day.  Must be 
                    fate.

                                  STEVEN FOSTER
                    Uh.

                                  JACKIE FOX
                          (to her friends)
                    I ll catch up.                                                                                    58.


      The friends move on.  Steven stands awkwardly, looking like a 
      trapped animal.

                                  JACKIE FOX (CONT D)
                    So -- how are you?

                                  STEVEN FOSTER
                    Good, you know.

      Jackie glances at the camera, not happy that it s there.

                                  JACKIE FOX
                          (to Steven)
                    Come on, let s get a drink.

      She leads Steven toward the bar.  We start to follow, but 
      Jackie turns to the camera.

                                  JACKIE FOX (CONT D)
                    Get lost.  I m serious.

      We stop, and watch as Steven and Jackie fade into the crowd.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Kenneth enters, carrying his bicycle helmet.  He looks 
      utterly dejected.  Then he notices that the living room is 
      full of wrapping paper and baby things.  Dawn is cleaning up.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    There you are.  You missed the baby 
                    shower.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                          (still distracted)
                    Sorry, I --

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    Where were you?  I thought you were 
                    coming?

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    I know.  I m sorry.  It s -- you 
                    look great.  Hold on.  I got you 
                      something.

      He goes to the cabinet, takes out a wrapped gift.  Dawn opens 
      it.  It s a baby Bjorn.                                                                                     59.


                                    KENNETH FINLEY (CONT D)
                    It s a Bjorn, so you can wear the 
                    baby around.  It helps promote 
                    intimacy.

      Dawn hands it to Kenneth.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    Try it on.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    No.  I -- 

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    Come on.  Try it on.

      She helps him put on the Bjorn, then slips a life-like baby 
      doll inside against Kenneth s chest.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO (CONT D)
                    How does it feel?

      This is all too much for Kenneth.  Dawn sees it, touches his 
      shoulder.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO (CONT D)
                    Thanks for taking care of me.  I m 
                    sorry I couldn t give you what you 
                    wanted.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    Sure.  No problem.

      She looks him in the eye, forcing a real connection.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    No.  I mean it.

      Kenneth nods. 

                                  DAWN BARBUSO (CONT D)
                    Besides, you better get used to 
                    wearing that, Uncle Kenneth.  

      The word floors him.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    Uncle?

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    You re part of this family now, 
                    mister.  Don t try to weasel out of 
                    it.                                                                                    60.


                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    No.  I mean, I won t.

      For a second Kenneth looks like he might cry, but then a wave 
      of happiness hits him.  He will be Uncle Kenneth.  For the 
      first time since we ve met Kenneth he looks truly thrilled.

      There s a knock at the door.  Kenneth is reluctant to end 
      this moment.  Another knock.  Kenneth takes off the Bjorn, 
      opens the door.

      Caroline and Tom Chung are standing there.  Caroline is 
      clearly upset.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY (CONT D)
                    Caroline.  I --

      Caroline sees the camera.  The last thing she wants is to be 
      on film right now.

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                    Sorry -- I didn t know where else 
                    to go.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    No.  Please.  Come in.  Hey, Tommy.  
                    I ve got some brownies.  You want a 
                    brownie?

      Caroline sees Dawn.

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                    Sorry.

      Dawn sees how upset Caroline is.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    No problem.  We were just finishing 
                    up.  Hey, buddy, I was gonna watch 
                    a movie.  You wanna hang with me 
                    and eat your brownie?

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                    You don t have to do that.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    Please.  I m gonna have one of 
                    these in three months.  I need the 
                    practice.

      She leads Tom into the other room.  Caroline glances at the 
      camera.                                                                                    61.

                    What s wrong?

                                  CAROLINE CHUNG
                    Could we -- 

      Kenneth realizes she wants privacy.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    Sure. 
                          (to camera crew)
                    Sorry, but -- give us a minute.

      Kenneth grabs his coat.  He and Caroline go outside.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Brenda is at her desk, working.  Ben Watts comes in.

                                  BEN WATTS
                    What happened?  Mickey said you 
                    walked out.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    I -- you know, he was -- sweet, but 
                    I m not really -- I m not gonna 
                    date right now.  It s, you know, 
                    with work, and -- Oh, but just FYI, 
                    watching that man eat is not 
                    pretty.

                                  BEN WATTS
                    Yeah.  You should see him with a 
                    hot dog.

      Brenda s phone rings.  She answers.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    Hello.
                          (listening)
                    Dad, slow down.  What happened?
                          (listening)
                    Oh my God.  Okay, don t move.  I m 
                    coming.

      She hangs up, gets up, grabs her coat.  

                                  BEN WATTS
                    What is it?

      She s frantic.  The camera tries to keep her in frame.                                                                                    62.


                                  BRENDA SERRANO
                    My mom had a stroke.  I have to go.

      The camera is in Brenda s way.

                                  BRENDA SERRANO (CONT D)
                    Get that thing out of my face.

      She pushes her way past, exits. We watch her leave.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      We are spying on Steven and Jackie through the front window.  
      They are sitting close together, talking.

                                  JACKIE HOLT
                    He s a nice guy.  He is.  I guess -- 
                    I don t know -- maybe we got 
                    married too young, you know?  You 
                    were smart.  You re out there 
                    seeing the world -- alone, no ties, 
                    nothing to hold you down.

      We zoom in on Steven s face.  Jackie s right.  Steven has no 
      ties, no bonds of any kind.  It is the life he chose, but 
      instead of being happy he feels empty.  He can t stop 
      thinking about his run-in with Caroline and Tom.

                                  STEVEN FOSTER
                    You know what.  I ve gotta -- sorry 
                    -- I need to make a phone call.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Steven steps out, holding the phone to his ear.  We spy on 
      him from a distance, zooming in.

                    Uh, yeah, hey, Caroline, it s me.
