    IN A MIRROR: a small home, its driveway empty. 

      Hank sits slouched in the passenger seat of a  79 Ford 
      Courier, heels dug into the dash, chewing a toothpick from 
      breakfast, still feeling the ache in his back.  His eyes 
      shift from the vacant driveway in his sideviewmirror to a 
      high-end bed-and-bath catalogue in his lap.                                                                                    2.



      Beside him, behind the wheel, sits his partner BRITT POLLACK. 
      Britt s younger than Hank and the athlete of the two; like 
      Hank, he s dressed for manual labor: jeans, a flannel over a 
      t-shirt, work boots (currently off).  He s absolutely 
      motionless, head back, baseball cap tipped over closed eyes, 
      very probably asleep.  

    The two are parked in shade, twenty yards from the house Hank 
    is monitoring.  Hand-painted on the side of their Courier are 
    the words  Gomez Bros. Pool Cleaners.  

                                  HANK
                    Loan me a thousand dollars.

      A beat.  Britt does not open his eyes.

                                  BRITT
                    Yeah, alright.

                                  HANK
                    Thinking about buying new towels.

                                  BRITT
                    You want to be a dryer person?

                                  HANK
                    I think maybe.

      Hank checks the driveway again: still empty.  Up ahead he  
      sees a young family loading its belongings into a U-Haul, a 
       FOR SALE BY BANK  sign staked in their lawn.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    I tell you what happened to me last 
                    night?  
                            (noresponse)
                    Did I?

                                  BRITT
                          (he can t escape this)
                    Tell me.

                                  HANK
                    I couldn t sleep.  I don t know 
                    why, I didn t have a nightmare, I 
                    just couldn t.  So I go down to the 
                    kitchen to get some milk.  And I 
                    take the carton out of the fridge 
                    but it s empty.                                                                                    3.



                                  BRITT
                          (waits for more, then:)
                    For a very short story, that went 
                    on a bit.

                                  HANK
                    Senility.  Not only did I put the 
                    milk back when it was empty, I 
                    don t even remember finishing it.  
                    Hey, scoff now but it ll happen to 
                    you one day.  You ll be driving 
                    home one night, not thinking about 
                    a thing, and suddenly you ll pull 
                    up to the house you lived in 
                    fifteen years ago.

                                  BRITT
                    I ll drive all the way to Laughlin?

      Hank moves to knock the cap off his partner s head but back 
      pain prevents him.  He notices, in his sideviewmirror, a 
      WHITE ACURA pull into the driveway.

                                  HANK
                    He s here.

    And Britt snaps to, opening his eyes and tipping his cap up 
    and adjusting his rearview mirror so he can see.  A BODY-
      BUILDER TYPE emerges from the Acura, gathers grocery bags 
      from within, then whistles out an ENGLISH BULLDOG who 
      obediently follows him indoors.

                                  BRITT
                    Christ, who drives a white car 
                    anymore?  Besides mailmen.

                                  HANK
                    He s a big guy.  Remind me: how 
                    much we getting paid for this?

                                  BRITT
                    Tell you after.

      That doesn t bode well.  Still, the moment Body-Builder 
      disappears inside, Hank and Britt are out of the truck and 
      getting ready, Hank grabbing a pool skimmer and bucket of 
      chlorine from the truck s cargo hold, Britt unburdening 
      himself of his flannel, tugging on his boots.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Once I m back there, gimme thirty 
                    seconds  fore you knock.                                                                                    4.



                                  HANK
                          (nods, then  struck )
                    Hey, you know what tune popped into 
                    my head this morning --

                                  BRITT
                          (who knows what s coming)
                    -- oh please don t --

                                  HANK
                    -- for the life of me, I can t 
                    remember the title of the thing --

                                  BRITT
                          (hurrying his boot on)
                    -- I m asking nicely, I m hungover
                    and I m asking nicely --

                                  HANK
                    -- bum--

                                  BRITT
                    -- stop --

                                  HANK
                    -- bum--

                                  BRITT
                    -- quit it --

                                  HANK
                          ( Close To You )
                    -- bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-
                    bum-bum, bum-bum-bum--

                                  BRITT
                    -- goddammit, it s gonnabe in my 
                    head all day now!

      Hank, proud of himself, snatches the cap off his partner s 
      head before Britt darts away into a neighboring yard.


      Returning to the Courier, Hank spies that young family again, 
    all loaded into their U-Haulnow; the mother fights back 
      tears as the father insists it s all going to be okay.  Hank 
      cringes as he gets in his truck and keys the engine.  

    He passes the Body-Builder s and stops at the next house.  
      Britt emerges from its yard, cradling Winston.  Before he can 
    get in the truck though, Hank clamps down on the door s lock.

                                  HANK
                    OK, tell me now: how much did we 
                    make for that?

                                  BRITT
                    S mydry cleaner s dog.  She said 
                    anything we bring in, half-off.
                          (Hank groans)
                    C mon, what else were we gonnado 
                    today?  Cure cancer?

                                  HANK
                    Maybe.

      Just then Body-Builder hits the sidewalk behind them, looking 
    for his dog.  He spots Winston in Britt s arms and shouts:

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    HEY!  THAT S MYDOG!

    No time to dawdle, Britt drops Winston through the window 
      into his seat, then leaps himself into the cargo hold.  Hank 
      stomps the gas as Body-Builder gives chase, hopelessly.  
      Britt salutes him with his own energy bar, then ducks his 
      head through the cab s rear window and smiles.

                                  HANK
                    Your dry cleaner s dog.  What do 
                    you own that could possibly need 
                      dry-cleaning?
                          (butBritt s grin is 
                            infectious; soon Hank 
                          can t help but smile)
                    You donkey.


                                    END OF TEASER                                                                                    8.


                                        ACT ONE


      Hank and Britt s favegreasy-spoon.  The Courier s parked out 
      front, window cracked open for Winston, pawing at the glass.


      Hank, Britt and Winston pass out-of-business storefronts on 
      their way back to their truck.  

                                  BRITT
                    You gonnatell me why Gustafson s 
                    pissedat you?

                                  HANK
                    It s ancient history.

                                  BRITT
                    Yeah, and he s getting over it all 
                    over the place.  Where to?
                          (Hank passes the address)
                     435 HuttingerDrive, San Marino.  
                    Mr. Lawrence Bingham Lindus III.   
                    Silver-spoon sonovabitchprobably 
                    has a live-in Mexican maid.

                                  HANK
                    When did you get so jaundiced?

                                  BRITT
                    When did you start using the word 
                     jaundiced ?


    AN HISPANIC HOUSEKEEPER stands within a massive front door.  
      Britt shoots Hank a look: toldja.                                                                                    16.



                                    HOUSEKEEPER
                    Mr. Lindus is expecting you.


    The Housekeeper shows them out to a TENNIS COURT where 
      BINGHAM LINDUS, an athletic 50, rallies against his 16-year
    old SON.  Britt was correct only up to a point; Lindus seems 
      about as un-stuffed-shirtas a man playing on his home tennis 
      court can be.  As our guys watch the point:

                                  BRITT
                    You ever play this game?

                                  HANK
                    Not professionally.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Nice, Phillip.  Nice.
                            (spyingthem)
                    Hi: are you guys...? 

                                  HANK
                    Margaret Tyler sent us over.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                          (he approaches, hand out)
                    Bingham Lindus.  Call me Bing.

                                  HANK
                    Mr. Lindus, I m Hank Dolworth, my 
                    partner Britt Pollack.  Britt s not 
                    wearing a belt today.                                                                                    17.



                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I asked Esther to set out some tea.
                          (hegestures them to a 
                            gazebo; back to his son)
                    Phil, I have to talk to these men 
                    for a while.  You wanna work on 
                    your serve  til I get back?
                          (tothem)
                    We think he may make the junior-pro 
                    tour next summer. 

      Neither Hank nor Britt knows what that means.

    IN THE GAZEBO - MOMENTS LATER

      Lindus pours iced tea for the three of them.

                                  HANK
                    Lovely home.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Thanks.  It s been in my wife s 
                    family three generations.  This 
                    area used to be all orange groves.  
                    Lemon?

                                  HANK
                    Thank you.  Will she be joining us, 
                    your -- ?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    No, Gwen passed away six years ago.  
                    Leukemia.  Consequently all this 
                    belongs to my kids now, or a trust 
                    representing them.  Philip out on 
                    the court and my daughter Elenore. 
                    It s she I want to talk to you 
                    about today.  This is all 
                      confidential, right, this 
                      conversation?

                                  HANK
                    Entirely.  We re like doctors.  Our 
                    profession relies on discretion.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Otherwise you lose your licenses?

                                  BRITT
                    If we had them.  

      That stops Lindus short.  Hank, smiling, explains:                                                                                    18.



                                  HANK
                    We ve found from experience that 
                    abiding by state certification 
                    guidelines unduly limits our 
                    efficacy.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Meaning?

                        HANKBRITT
      Meaning we --Meaning we break the law 
                                                    sometimes when we feel it 
                                                  suits our purpose.
                                                      (a look to Hank)
                                                  Tends to speed things up.

                                  HANK
                    That said, rest assured, nothing 
                    you tell us leaves this gazebo.

      Bingham considers them both.  Then:

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I need you to find my daughter. 

                                  HANK
                    Elenore.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    None of us have seen her in two 
                    weeks.  Not me, not Philip, not 
                    Esther.  

                                  HANK
                    She s been missing two weeks?  Have 
                    you contacted the police?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    She s not, sorry, she s not 
                     missing.   Ellie is, well... She s 
                    a freshman at USC, though still 
                    living here at home.  This semester 
                    she fell in with a crowd at school, 
                    music types, I don t know what they 
                    call themselves.  These charges 
                    started showing up on her credit 
                    card bill, from guitar stores and 
                    liquor stores.  I became suspicious 
                    Ellie was being exploited by these 
                    people.  So I sat her down and told 
                    her as much.  She stormed out.                                                                                    19.



                                  HANK
                    That was the last you saw her.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    We ve tried calling her cell phone, 
                    going down to campus.  Nothing.  
                    Her dean says she hasn t been in 
                    any of her classes.

                                  BRITT
                    You don t think she s in any 
                     trouble ?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Not the kind you mean.

                                  BRITT
                    You seem pretty sure?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I m not a hundred percent but... 
                    How do I put this?  I suspect my 
                    daughter s not that kind of girl.

    Off Hank and Britt, not sure what that means --


      Hank and Britt exit, Lindus watching them from his door. 

                                  HANK
                    What dyou find?

                                  BRITT
                    Diary under her mattress.

                                  HANK
                    Let s go find this girl.  

                                  BRITT
                    And cash that check.


      SOME KIDS playing kickball in the street skedaddle for the 
      sidewalks as the Gomez Bros.Ford Courier rattles through.


    -- they ve pulled up in front of a modest craftsman home.  An 
       Open House Today  sign is spiked in its lawn.

                                  BRITT
                    This is your old place.

                                  HANK
                    Yep.

                                  BRITT
                    Gretchen s putting it up for sale?

                                  HANK
                    That s what the sign says.

                                  BRITT
                    Signs can lie.


      Amidst afternoon freeway traffic, WE PICK UP Hank and Britt s 
      Ford Courier merging onto the Harbor.

                                  DMV EMPLOYEE ON PHONE (PRE-LAP)
                    DMV, how can I help you?


    -- the Courier pushes on toward --


    -- a deserted stretch south of downtown s skyscrapers. 
      Littered with vacant lots and decaying brick factories.

                                  BRITT
                        ...1300...1300...When was the 
                    ticket issued?

                                  HANK
                    Three weeks ago.  1:53 a.m.  She 
                    mustaspent the night.
                          (offBritt s look)
                    Would you leave your car here 
                    overnight you weren t sleeping 
                    over?

                                  BRITT
                    If I was drunk.
                            (spottingit)
                    1300.  Looks promising.

      1300 is an abandoned factory.  Might as well have tumbleweeds 
      blowing past.  Hank notes an adjoining, fenced parking lot.                                                                                    27.



                                  HANK
                    Let s take a gander.
                          (Britt doesn t budge)
                    You coming?

                                  BRITT
                    As a rule, I don t get outtathe 
                    truck without a retainer.

      Hank tosses him the diary.

                                  HANK
                    Read up then.  Anything about a 
                    Laura Prince or Price, crease the 
                    page.  Winston, c mon.

                                  BRITT
                    Whatyaneed him for?

                                  HANK
                    I like to work with a partner.

      MOMENTS LATER, at the parking lot s fence, Hank squeezes 
      Winston through an opening.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                          (waving him onward)
                    Go on, Winnie.Act natural.

      Winston begins sniffing around the lot and Hank proceeds to 
    the factory s entrance.  He knocks, waits.  Notes a spray-
      painted logo on the cement beneath him:  Dirty Sanchez. 

                                  A VOICE WITHIN
                    Yeah?!

                                  HANK
                    Hi!  My dog s stuck in your lot!

                                  VOICE WITHIN
                    What?

                                  HANK
                    My dog s stuck in your lot!!

      A moment passes before the door opens.  A twentysomething
      HIPSTER stands there, none-too-happy to be disturbed.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  My dog snuck through your 
                    fence.                                                                                    28.



                                  HIPSTER
                    Yeah?

                                  HANK
                    Yeah.  Mind if I get him?

    The Hipster eyes Hank, then glances around the block: all he 
      sees is a beat-up pool cleaners truck, nobody inside.

                                  HIPSTER
                    Alright.

                                  HANK
                    You re a prince of the realm.

      Britt, sunk down in his seat, watches as Hank enters. 


      Hank gathers Winston as the Hipster unlocks the fence.

                                  HANK
                    Thanks again.  Say, what s your 
                    name, or your band s name?  I ve 
                    got some friends in the industry, 
                    maybe they could help you out.

                                  HIPSTER
                    I told you, man, that s not what 
                    I m about.

                                  HANK
                    I never met anyone who didn t need 
                    a little help getting their stuff 
                    out there.

                                  HIPSTER
                          (extends his hand)
                    You just did.  

                                  HANK
                          (takes it, doesn t let go)
                    Hey, you don t happen to know a 
                    girl named ElenoreLindus, do you?

                                  HIPSTER
                    Man, you got your dog --

                                  HANK
                    How about a Laura Prince or Price?

      That name hits a nerve.  Hipster tears his hand away.

                                  HIPSTER
                    Get off my property, huh?

    He means it.  Hank steps onto the sidewalk and the Hipster 
      slams his fence shut behind him.

                                  HANK
                    Thanks for the help.

    The Hipster throws him the bird as he returns inside.  Hank 
      returns to the truck.  Britt rises in his seat.                                                                                    31.



                                  BRITT
                    Kid s a turd. 

                                  HANK
                    Let s see where he floats.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MINUTES LATER.  The Hipster emerges from his place, pushing 
    out a Vespa.He steps on, kick-starts it and is off.  He 
      doesn t notice the Ford Courier falling in a distance behind.  

    In the truck: Britt keeps a loose tail.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                          (re: the diary)
                    You glean anything from this?

                                  BRITT
                    She mentions Laura once or twice.

      Hank notices: Britt has creased every page.  They continue to 
      follow the Vespa, into --


    -- where the Hipster pulls up at a COFFEEHOUSE.  He dashes 
      inside as Britt and Hank u-turnto park across the street.  
    As they case the joint: 

                                  HANK
                    Whatyathink?  You wanna stay in 
                    the truck for this or --

                                  BRITT
                          (back on the job)
                    Crack a window for Winston.

      They re going in.  Hank takes Elenore s diary with him.  As 
      they disembark, though, an LAPD PATROL CAR cruises by.  The 
    two UNISinside clock them as they pass.  

                                  UNI 1
                    Is that -- ?

                                  UNI 2
                    Yep.

    As Britt smiles at them and mutters under his breath --

                                  BRITT
                    Hello, donkeys.                                                                                    32.



    -- Hank notices something tucked in the diary s back pages: A 
      PAYCHECK STUB.  The payee:  Laura Price.   The payer:  JA
      KUEHN& ASSOC. PAYROLL CO.   He pockets it.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    What s that?

                                  HANK
                    Pay stub for Laura Price.

    He pockets it.  Cops passed, they proceed to --


      Britt and Hank exit in time to spot Blonde Elenore climbing 
      aboard the Hipster s Vespa.

                                  BRITT
                    C mon.

      Hank and Britt hurry back to their Courier, to give chase, 
      only to find: it s being lifted onto a TOW TRUCK.  The two 
      uni soversee the tow job.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    What the hell?!

                                  UNI 2
                    One hour parking zone.

                                  HANK
                    We were here five minutes!                                                                                    35.



                                  UNI 1
                    Not according to our watch.

    The Unisstifle smirks, obviously enjoying this.

                                  HANK
                    You gotta be -- Oh, you 
                      sonsabitches!

                                  UNI 2
                    You can reclaim your vehicle at the 
                    city impound.  I m sure it ll only 
                    take five, six hours to process at 
                    the most.  Have a great day.

    The cops go, laughing.  So does the Courier, behind the tow 
      truck.  So does, in the opposite direction, Elenore Lindus.

                                  HANK
                    Shit.We had her.

                                  BRITT
                    Hank.  Winston was in the truck.

      Hank squeezes his eyes shut: fuuuuuuuck--


    -- where she discovers Britt on her doorstep.

                                  KATIE
                    Yes?

                                  BRITT
                    Sorry to disturb you, ma am, during 
                    the dinner hour.

                                  KATIE
                    That s alright, what is it?                                                                                    36.



                                  BRITT
                    I m canvassing the neighborhood on 
                    behalf of a charity called Tomes

                                  KATIE
                    You lose your keys?

                                  BRITT
                    And Hank s truck.

    At the sound of her pasta boiling over, she kisses Britt and 
      rushes back inside, shouting over her shoulder:

                                  KATIE
                    Tell your BFFI made enough for 
                    three.

      Britt turns to Hank, paying off a CABBIE in the street.

                                  BRITT
                    Soup s on.

                                  HANK
                    Christ, please don t let her ve
                    made Italian again.


      Britt throws the cover off a 1961 Triumph Trophy Bird.

                                  HANK
                    God, I hate this thing.

                                  BRITT
                    Why?  Cause it s  unsafe? 

                                  HANK
                    Cause it s so butch.


    The men arrive via motorcycle.  Hank heads inside to pay the 
      impound fee while Britt goes in search of Winston; the moment 
    he spots the pup lapping at a waterbowl, he lights up.

                                  BRITT
                    Winston!  Where dyou go, we ve 
                    been worried sick?!                                                                                    41.



    The feeling s mutual; Winston comes hurtling toward him, into 
    his arms.  Hank watches from an office window.  The opening 
      strings of Nat Cole s  Stardust  take us to --


    -- where BRITT S DRY-CLEANER re-unites with Winston.

                                    DRY-CLEANER
                    Ooooh, my little baby!  Oh, I ve 
                    missed you!

      Britt can t hide the fact he ll miss the animal.  

                                  BRITT
                    He s been a...a very good boy.

      Hank waits in the reclaimed Courier, Trophy Bird in its 
      cargo.  He flips Laura Price s paystubbetween his fingers, 
      lost in thought as he listens to the radio:

       ...love is now the stardust of yesterday, the music of the 
      years gone by... 

      Britt gets in and Hank snaps out of his reverie.

                                  HANK
                    All set?

      Britt nods.  Both men in too contemplative a mood to joke.


      Hank and Britt return to the truck.

                                  BRITT
                    So when were you thinking about 
                    doing this, getting out?

                                  HANK
                    Hey, it s just something I m 
                    kicking around.  Don t bum-rush me 
                    out the door yet.
                            (sensingBritt s unease)
                    Something you wanna say?

                                  BRITT
                      Nah.Besides your suggesting that 
                    what we do for a living is 
                    infantile, you haven t given any 
                    offence.
                          (before Hank can speak)
                    I think you should quit, it s what 
                    you re experienced at.  Being a 
                    cop, Gretchen...

      Britt just crossed a line.  And he knows it.

                                  HANK
                    Fair enough.  Let s get you home to 
                    get shit-facedso your girlfriend 
                    can figure out maybe it s time to 
                    move on.
                          (now the other line s 
                            crossed; both men fume)
                    I m pretty zonked.  Whatyasay we 
                    call it a night?

                                  BRITT
                    That s a genius goddamnidea.

    As both men round the Courier, separated briefly --

                  HANK (CONT D)BRITT
    -- jesus christ ---- sonovabitch --


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    45.


                                      ACT THREE


      A facility in the sticks.


      They exit into sunlight.  Britt notices a YOUNG MAN entering 
    the compound, a lunch box in hand, his most distinct feature 
      a bandaged nose.  He alerts Hank.

                                  HANK
                    Isn t that the kid whose face you 
                    picked a fight with yesterday?

      Unfortunately, just as Hank and Britt are recognizing the EMO 
      TOUGH, he s recognizing them.  He turns and bolts.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    What s that about?

                                  BRITT
                          (shrugs)
                    Kid wants to be chased.

      They take off after him.  The chase begins.  

    And almost immediately ends.  Because the Emo-Tough goes 
      straight to his beat-up Toyotain the plant parking lot and 
      while he s digging for his keys, Britt appears --

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Hey.

    -- and Emo retreats the other way but Hank s standing there 
    so he chooses a third path: over the tops of a row of parked 
      cars, leaping from roof to roof.  

    On the ground Hank and Britt try to keep pace with him.

                                  HANK
                    Kid, get down from there.  
                      You re...endangering paint jobs.

    The Tough slips, drops his lunch box, keeps going.  On a 
      hunch, Hank stops to retrieve it.

      Ahead, another EMPLOYEE has pulled into work and the Emo-
      Tough leaps down, yanks him from his vehicle and gets in.  As 
    he hits the gas, the car door slams Britt in the shoulder.                                                                                    48.



                                  BRITT
                    Ahhh!

    The kid gets away.  Britt stands there, rubbing his shoulder, 
      watching him go.  Hank joins him, lunch box in hand.

                                  HANK
                    You okay?

                                  BRITT
                    No.  What s that?

                                  HANK
                    Kid dropped it.  Thought it might 
                    be important.

    He opens the box: a sandwich, an apple, a Thermos.  

                                  BRITT
                    He got away but he s gonnamiss 
                    three of the major food groups.

      Hank opens the last and sniffs, then offers it to Britt.

                                  HANK
                    What s that smell like to you?

                                  BRITT
                    Water.

                                  HANK
                    Exactly.

      Hank drains the Thermos, filled with tap water, to discover 
      several liquid-filled vials hidden inside.

                    Usually kills  em within four or 
                    five days unless they re

                    And if they re slaughtered first?

                                  HEALTH INSPECTOR
                    Their meat becomes poisonous.

                    Jesus, they were trying to infect

                    Any idea who might want to do that?

                    No, but I bet theydo.

    He points to Hank and Britt, sitting nearby, held for 
      questioning.  They try to look as innocent as possible.

                                  HANK
                    Hey, Hopalong, we re the guys

                    Or that s how you want it to look.
                          (to the Officer)
                    They say they re PI s but I never 
                    saw any ID.

                                  LEAD OFFICER
                          (turns to Hank and Britt)
                    What are your names?
                          (Hank mumbles them)
                    I m sorry, what was that?

      Hank knows they re fuckedand is about to speak clearly when:

                                  A VOICE
                    Hank Dolworthand Britt Pollack.

      Hank cringes: he didn t know they were thisfucked.That s 
      because DETECTIVE MARK GUSTAFSON has arrived on the scene. 
      Dark glasses, bull-chested, Philippe sFrench Dip still on 
    his breath.  He badges the lead officer.                                                                                    50.

                                  GUSTAFSON
                    OK.  Though someone used my name 
                    and ID yesterday to get some info 
                    out of the DMV.  Funny, they have 
                    this device called Caller ID helped 
                    them figure out who d done it.
                          (bigsmile)
                    Feel like going to jail?

                                  HANK
                    Guess so.


      Hank and Britt exit alongside Bingham Lindus.

                                  HANK
                    Thanks, Mr. Lindus, for the bail.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Not at all.  Thank youfor your 
                    discretion at my plant, keeping 
                    Elenore s name out of it.  

      Hank s distracted by Gustafson across the parking lot.  He 
      waves -- see you soon --as he gets in his car.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS (CONT D)

                    Who threw us in jail.  
                          (backto the case)
                    We ve seen your daughter and she s 
                    fine.  Obviously this group she s 
                    caught up with is involved in more 
                    than just music.  Some sort of eco-

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Any idea where she might be now?

                                  BRITT
                    We think wherever Laura Price is.  
                    If you could get her address from 
                    your supervisor, sir --

      Lindus produces it.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    He told me who you were asking 
                    after, so I...

                    Gentlemen, obviously my daughter s 
                    in a far more precarious situation 
                    than I first imagined.  If you can 
                    find her by the end of the day and 
                    get her away from this cabal, I m 
                    willing to offer you triple your 
                    normal fee.
                          (off their reactions)
                    You think you can do that?

    In answer to that question --

                    Price.  3H.Let s go.

                                  HANK 
                    She s not home.                                                                                    53.



                                  BRITT
                    How do you --

                                  HANK
                    Cause she s there.

    He points to a CARPORT where LAURA PRICE is loading the back 
    of an old Volvo, bumper littered with stickers to recycle/end 
        war/impeach/save whales/go green/go vegan.  Pretty most days, 
      she s a harried wreck right now.  Hank and Britt approach.

                                  BRITT
                    Laura Price?
                          (shestartles)
                    We catch you on moving day or are 
                    you high-tailing it outtahere for 
                    another reason?

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    Who are you?

                                  HANK
                      Detectives.  Looking for Elenore 
                    Lindus.  You seen her lately?  It 
                    was probably a lot like looking in 
                    a mirror.

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    No.  Not since she tried to have me 
                    killed.  
                          (off their reactions)
                    You still wondering why I m getting 
                    the hell out of here?


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    54.


                                        ACT FOUR


      Gretchen Dolworthsits at an outdoor table.  Hank rounds a 
      corner, stops to tuck in his shirt before approaching.

                                  HANK
                    Heya, beautiful.

      Right off he sees: his charm s not gonnawork for him here.  
      Gretchen s stiff as he kisses her hello.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Still pissed, huh?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    No.  Not at all.  Thanks for 
                    meeting me.  I m not keeping you 
                    from anything, am I?

                                  HANK
                    Got a few hours off.  Any luck this 
                    case llbe done by tonight.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Something interesting?

                                  HANK
                    If you find chicken empire 
                    heiresses with personality 
                    disorders interesting, sure.

      Hank waits for a smile; none comes.  But, it s true, she s 
    not angry.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    So the house...

                                  HANK
                    I apologize.  What I did was 
                      inappropriate.                                                                                    57.



                                  GRETCHEN
                    Thank you.

                                  HANK
                    It s just, I ve been thinking about 
                    making some changes in my life and, 
                    well, I kindagot carried away.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Changes like?

                                  HANK
                    Quitting my business.  

      That brings her up short, like Hank knew it would.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    You serious?

                                  HANK
                    As gingivitis.  Gonnahand it over 
                    lock-stock to Britt.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Why?  You love your work.

                                  HANK
                    It s stopped being fun.  Or I feel 
                    too old to find fun in it anymore.  
                    The romantic allure is gone.  Maybe 
                    I just realized that, running 
                    around like an idiot, my life 
                    hasn t added up to much.  
                          (he means that to resonate 
                          with her, and it does)
                    And why pull Britt down that hole 
                    with me?  Anyway, I will retract my 
                    bid on the house.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    No.  If you were buying it for you, 
                    go ahead.  It ll be easier actually 
                    than selling to someone else.  I 
                    just wanted to make sure you 
                    weren t buying it for me.

                                  HANK
                          (tries to laugh it off)
                    Buying it for you, whatya...

    She steels herself to share big news.  Before she can though:                                                                                    58.



                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    You re getting married again.

    She nods, gingerly.  He dies a little inside.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    When?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    This summer.  

                                  HANK
                    Do I know him?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    God, I hope not.  He s an architect 
                    downtown.  Lives in Hancock Park.

                                  HANK
                    How long has this been...?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    About six months.  You ll laugh at 
                    me: we met online.

                                  HANK
                          (all his strength to lie)
                    That s terrific, Gretch.Really. 

      Gretchen knows he s putting on a brave face.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Anyway, I ll be moving in with him 
                    soon so I don t really need the 
                    house.  Look at the bright side: 
                    come June, you won t have to pay 
                    alimony. 
                          (she rises)
                    Thanks for understanding, Hank.

    She kisses him and goes.  Hank just sits there, deflated.


      A VIEW THROUGH TREES OF A GOLF COURSE, amber light bouncing 
    off water, a final foursome on the 18th.  Katie sits on the 
      roof of her house, glass of wine in hand, taking in the 
      sunset: this is as close as she gets to living in luxury.

      Britt appears from the attic window, comes to sit beside her.

                                  BRITT
                    How dit go?  The mid-term?                                                                                    59.



                                  KATIE
                    Don t find out til Monday.

      They watch the sunset.  He borrows her wine for a sip.

                                  BRITT
                    Been thinking about us getting a 
                    dog.

                                  KATIE
                          (surprised)
                    Yeah?  Any particular breed?

                                  BRITT
                    Bulldog maybe, I don t know.  I 
                    thought we could go to the pound 
                    this weekend, pick one out.  All I 
                    know is I wanna name it after my 
                    Uncle Lassie.
                          (shesmiles)
                    I know it s not a baby.  But I 
                    figure it s a gateway 
                    responsibility.  You up for it?

    She nods.  He kisses her.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

                                  KATIE
                    For?

                                  BRITT
                          (shakes his head)
                    It d take too long.


    He joins Hank, waiting in the truck.                                                                                    60.



                                  BRITT
                    She s inside.  Now can we call 
                    Daddy Warbucksand end this thing?

                                  HANK
                          (looks around)
                    He shows up here, she s got seven, 
                    eight different escape routes. 

                                  BRITT
                    Is that ourproblem?

      Hank nods.  Britt sighs, settles in for the wait.


      MOVING ALONG THE ROAD, the Hipster s Vespablows past us, 
      Elenore aboard, followed by a car filled with the rest of 
      Dirty Sanchez and their girlfriends.  Farther back Hank and 
      Britt keep pace in their Courier.


    The caravan pulls into the driveway of a TWO-STORY FAMILY 
      HOME, and the emo cabal, seven strong, enter.  Hank and Britt 
      park down the street. 

      MOMENTS LATER, they re peering through a window.  In the 
      living room, the band s having a post-show party; in the 
      kitchen Elenore and Hipster prepare a plate of ecstacy.

                                  BRITT
                    Can we call him now?

      Hank takes out his cell and dials.  No signal.  He tries 
      again.  Still none.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Oh you gotta be --


      They ve had to come all the way down to the flats.  Hank, 
      with signal now, talks on his cell.                                                                                    61.



                                  HANK
                    412 Franklin.  Yes, sir.  No, she s 
                    not, there are about six other kids 
                    with her.  Okay.  We ll wait in 
                    front until you get there.
                          (hehangs up; to Britt)
                    He s twenty minutes out.

                                  BRITT
                          (7-11 across the street)
                    Wanna get a Slurpee?


      Emosretreat from living room to the basement.  Hank and 
      Britt watch, parked back in front of the house.  Hank once 
      again flips through the bed-and-bath catalogue.

                                  BRITT
                    So when Lindus gets here, gets his 
                    daughter, is that all she wrote?
                          (Hank doesn t understand)
                    Are you still quitting?

                                  HANK
                    Why, you chomping at the bit to 
                    have me gone?

                                  BRITT
                    No more than usual.

      A beat.  Hank remembers his coffee with Gretchen.

                                  HANK
                    Ah, you re right.  What the hell am 
                    I really gonnado besides this?

      Britt is secretly relieved.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Heard this song today.

                                  BRITT
                    Please, no.

                                  HANK
                    Bum-bum-bum, bum-bum--

                                  BRITT
                    -- would you quit, before --

                                  HANK
                    -- bum-BUM-bum-bum-BUM--                                                                                    62.



                                  BRITT
                    -- what is that --

                                  HANK
                    -- bum-bum-BUM-bum-bum--

                                  BRITT
                    -- you re just making that up --

                                  HANK
                    -- yes I am.

      Britt rolls his eyes.  And just then a MUFFLED GUNSHOT echoes 
      from inside the house.  Both men freeze.

                                                                            CUT TO:

    THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, as Hank and Britt slip through a side 
      gate.  They peer in windows: so sign of the emos.  

      They come to a door, locked.  Hank nods to Britt who launches 
    his elbow through a glass panel. He unlocks it; they enter.


    As discreetly as possible they rush back to their truck.  
      POLICE SIRENS approach in the distance.

                                  HANK
                          (noticing at last)
                    Vespa s gone.

      They drive off before the cops arrive.


    The Courier pulls up in front.  Shortly after they knock, 
      Lindus lets them in.  He s taken aback by their grim faces.


      Lindus sees them out.

                                  LINDUS
                    Gentlemen, I can t tell you how 
                    much I appreciate your work.  I 
                    don t completely understand what 
                    happened tonight but perhaps I m 
                    better off not knowing.  Regardless 
                    we had a deal.  Three times your 
                    fee for the safe return of my 
                    daughter by tonight.
                          (hehands them a check)
                    For your diligence and discretion.

    He bids them a good night, disappears inside.  Hank and Britt 
      just stand there, flummoxed.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Back at their truck, Britt paces as Hank thinks.

                                  BRITT
                      Bullshit.No way she was here half 
                    an hour ago.

                                  HANK
                    I know.                                                                                    66.



                                  BRITT
                    I wanna see if there s a Vespa
                    parked in that garage.  Daddy s 
                    covering for her, you know that?

                                  HANK
                    Probably.

                                  BRITT
                    Hank, we might be accessories to 
                    murder.  What are we going to do?

      A beat, then Hank comes to a decision.

                                  HANK
                    We re gonnaget in the truck and 
                    drive home.


      Britt drops Hank off for the night.  Before he gets out, Hank 
      offers his hand and Britt shakes it. 

                                  BRITT
                    Partner.

                                  HANK
                    See you in the morning.                                                                                    67.
