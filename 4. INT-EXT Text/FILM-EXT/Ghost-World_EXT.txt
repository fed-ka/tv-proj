A modern high school auditorium. Over the entrance a banner
with a "Coca Cola" logo reads: "GRADUATION TODAY 2 PM."
The auditorium door opens and GRADUATES emerge. Enid & Rebecca
run away from the crowd, triumphantly holding rolled up
diplomas. They run toward the school playground, nearly
bursting with excitement over their long-awaited release.
Enid stops and looks back at the school. She gives it THE
FINGER. They sit on a see-saw, out of breath.
ENID
God, what a bunch of retards...
REBECCA
I thought Chipmunk-face was never
going to shut up.
ENID
I know, I liked her better when she
was an alcoholic crack addict! She
gets in one car wreck and all of a
sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and
everybody loves her.
REBECCA
It's totally sickening.
(she unrolls her
DIPLOMA)
Let's see if they gave me the right
diploma...
Enid opens hers. Instead of a diploma, it's an OFFICIAL
LOOKING DOCUMENT with a pink Post-It note on the front page.
ENID
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
REBECCA
What?
ENID
These assholes are saying that I
have to go to Summer school and take
some stupid art class!
REBECCA
Why?
ENID
Remember that stupid hippie art
teacher who failed me sophomore year?
I didn't think that just because you
get an "F" that means you have to
take the class over again.
REBECCA
You loser.
The sign reads "Welcome Graduates".
Under harsh, glaring sunshine, the girls follow a half-block
behind the SATANISTS.
REBECCA
What do you do if you're a satanist,
anyway?
ENID
You know, sacrifice virgins and
stuff...
REBECCA
That lets us off the hook.
The SATANISTS continue slowly along with Enid & Rebecca still
following.
ENID
Maybe there's some weird secret
satanic society that meets at the
Quality Cafe and all of the other
regular customers are in on it except
for us.
REBECCA
Or maybe not.
ENID
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or
they're planning to brainwash us and --
REBECCA
Okay, okay!
ENID
Hey, look at this...
Enid points at the mini-mall in front of them. A new
restaurant - we see their banner: "GRAND OPENING. WOWSVILLE -
THE AUTHENTIC 50'S DINER".
ENID
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when
were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
REBECCA
God, it's so totally pathetic.
A franchise convenience store with a western motif.
Josh is driving, chauffeur-like, with the two girls relaxing
in the back seat.
JOSH
Why do you even need a ride? You
could walk there in two minutes.
ENID
It's just an excuse for us to spend
time with you.
Enid and Rebecca giggle.
REBECCA
So Josh, if this guy freaks out,
will you protect us?
JOSH
He has every reason to freak out --
this is a totally fucked-up thing to
do to somebody!
ENID
God, I think Josh is too mature for
us.
REBECCA
I know, look at the way he drives...
he's like an old man.
ENID
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
Their car accelerates.
The trio drive in silence. Suddenly, an extra-wide pick-up
vrooms past Josh, cutting off the driver (SEYMOUR) next to
him. SEYMOUR bobs violently as he screams silent obscenities.
JOSH
Jesus, look at this guy.
ENID
Oh my God, that's HIM!
REBECCA
Are you sure?
ENID
Totally! Look!
ANGLE ON: SEYMOUR really having a fit now. Once it's out of
his system, he reverts to an amiable poker-face.
ENID
He's insane!
REBECCA
We should follow him home.
JOSH
Forget it.
ENID
Come on, Josh... don't you want to
see where he lives?
JOSH
No.
ENID
But this guy is like a one-of-kind,
rare butterfly, and we have to follow
him back to his natural habitat...
JOSH
You need counseling.
Several minutes have passed. Seymour parks.
REBECCA
God, he lives right in our
neighborhood!
Seymour gets out and disappears up the steps of his building.
ENID
He doesn't even look that bummed
out, really.
REBECCA
I know... wouldn't you be totally
pissed off?
ENID
This kind of thing must happen to
him all the time.
Enid and Rebecca stand in front of Seymour's apartment.
ENID
This is way too creepy.
REBECCA
He won't see us... we'll just stalk
him from a distance.
ENID
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start
feeling really bad again.
A pause.
ENID
So what should we do? We can't just
hide all day waiting for him to come
out...
There are three mail slots. Enid pulls the mail out of the
first one. We see FLOWER BULB CATALOGUES, and LADIES HOME
JOURNAL.
ENID
This is girl mail.
She grabs the mail out of SLOT NUMBER TWO.
ENID
This is all computer catalogues and
stuff...
Rebecca is looking at the mail from SLOT NUMBER THREE.
REBECCA
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...
(she flips through
the mail)
Oh my God, The National Psoriasis
Foundation!
ENID
Bingo!
She shoves back the contents of slot number two and grabs
the mail from Rebecca. We hear MALE VOICES around the corner.
REBECCA
Wait! Do you hear that?
Enid jams the mail back in the slot in a panic.
ENID
Shit!
They slowly walk around the bushes toward the voices.
REBECCA
Did you have to buy new hair dye or
did you still have some left over
from eighth grade?
ENID
Fuck you, bitch!
They walk past a sad-looking ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE, in
a distinctive old building, that looks as if it's been there
forever. They stop and peer through the window.
ENID
We still have to go in there sometime.
REBECCA
It's always closed...
ENID
I bet they have tons of incredible
shoes hidden in the back.
They continue walking.
ENID
Hey look, it's the pants.
We see a pair of discarded jeans on the sidewalk.
REBECCA
Where are we going?
ENID
Let's go hassle Josh.
REBECCA
"Hassle"?
They see a MIDDLE-AGED MAN dressed in a shabby threadbare
suit and hat sitting at what was once a bus stop. The rusty
sign has a red sticker on it that says "No longer in service."
REBECCA
There he is...
ENID
As always.
REBECCA
Waiting for the bus that never
comes...
ENID
I wonder if he's just totally insane
and he really thinks a bus is coming
or --
REBECCA
Why don't you ask him.
Enid sits next to THE MAN. Rebecca stands behind the bench,
taken aback that Enid is going to end the long standing
speculation.
ENID
Hi... what's your name?
MAN
(looks at watchless
wrist, then down the
street)
Norman.
ENID
...are you waiting for a bus?
MAN
Yes.
ENID
I hate to tell you this but they
cancelled this bus line two years
ago... There are no buses on this
street.
MAN
You don't know what you're talking
about.
Enid & Rebecca are on the outside porch/walkway on the second
floor of Josh's building. Enid POUNDS on his pasteboard door;
the windows RATTLE with each hollow THUD.
ENID
JOSH!
REBECCA
JOSH!
ENID & REBECCA
JOSH!
ENID
He's probably in there jerking off.
REBECCA
I'll bet he never jerks off...
ENID
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like
that.
REBECCA
Should we leave a note?
Enid finds a piece of paper - the back of a pizza flyer.
ENID
Do you have a pen?
She writes, while Rebecca looks over her shoulder. "Dear
Josh. We came by to fuck you but you didn't answer the door.
Therefore you are gay. Signed, Tiffany and Amber."
REBECCA
You're not really going to leave
that are you?
Enid pushes the note over his doorknob.
REBECCA
Why are we going here? I hate this
place.
ENID
It'll only take a second.
As Enid and Seymour walk. A 20-ish secretary-type passes.
ENID
What about her? Would you go out
with her?
SEYMOUR
I don't know, what kind of question
is that? I mean it's totally
irrelevant because a girl like that
would never be caught dead with me...
ENID
But putting that aside for now, would
you go out with her?
SEYMOUR
I really didn't get a good look at
her.
A breasty, overweight 40-year-old walks by.
ENID
Okay, what about this one? Are you
into girls with big tits?
SEYMOUR
(embarrassed)
Jesus!
ENID
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect
data here! Don't you want me to find
you your perfect dream girl?
SEYMOUR
I'm just not one of those guys who
has a "type"...
ENID
Every guy has a type!
SEYMOUR
(he doesn't really
mean this)
I mean as long as she's not a complete
imbecile and she's even remotely
attractive...
They walk by "the pants."
ENID
Hey look, there's Norman!
He's sitting as before at the defunct bus stop.
ENID
Hi Norman.
Norman nods politely. Seymour looks quizzically at Enid.
They're in another part of town near THE SIDEWINDER.
ENID
We need to narrow this down somehow...
we need to find a place where you
can meet women who share your
interests.
SEYMOUR
Maybe I don't want to meet someone
who shares my interests.
I hate my
interests! Where can I go to meet
the exact opposite of myself?
ENID
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your
five main interests, in order of
importance.
SEYMOUR
(sighs)
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have
to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and
Ragtime music at the top of the list,
then probably...
ENID
Let's just say "music" - that way
you only use up one...
(spots The Sidewinder)
Wait, we have to go in here for a
second...
Enid & Seymour continue walking.
SEYMOUR
(pause)
So is that your boyfriend?
ENID
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend...
He's just this guy that Becky and I
like to torture.
SEYMOUR
Well are --
ENID
(interrupts suddenly)
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
They are in front of STAN'S, a porno shop.
SEYMOUR
Yeah, sure... very funny....
ENID
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have
been dying to go in here but we can't
get any boys to take us...
Please?
SEYMOUR
I - I'd really rather not...
ENID
We'll just go in for one minute --
it'll be a riot!
SEYMOUR
I don't think so...
ENID
PLEASE? We have to!
SEYMOUR
I really don't think it's a good
idea.
ENID
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Seymour drives. Enid plays with the radio stopping on an
obnoxious AM Disc Jockey.
DISC JOCKEY
KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful
evening.
SEYMOUR
God, that asshole's voice is so
hateful! No wonder I never listen to
the radio!
ENID
(shutting it off)
Relax, Seymour, relax...
SEYMOUR
That thing is just so shrill and
piercing and loud - it's like someone
jabbing me in the face!
(imitating insincere
DJ voice)
KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful
evening...
She changes the subject and holds up a 78 record.
ENID
So, why did you bring this along?
SEYMOUR
I brought it for him to autograph.
He's going to be amazed to see it -
it's one of two known copies... I
can't believe they have him for the
opening act and not the headliner.
What an insult!
ENID
This bar's going to be packed with
girls for you to pick from.
SEYMOUR
I'm not holding my breath in that
department.
Seymour waits at a stop sign for two OBLIVIOUS OVERWEIGHT
WOMEN, each with TODDLERS and baby carriages, to cross..
SEYMOUR
What are we, in slow motion here?!
What are ya, hypnotized? Have some
more kids, why don't you?... For
Christ's sake, would you move!?
ENID
Jesus, Seymour.
A marquee reads, "TONITE: BLUESHAMMER also FRED CHATMAN"
It's the next day. Enid has set up a GARAGE SALE in front of
her apartment building. Rebecca arrives.
REBECCA
This is it? I can't believe you're
selling some of this stuff.
ENID
Fuck it. Everything must go!
REBECCA
Oh my god, I remember this hat...
this was during your little old lady
phase...
A trendy young HIPSTER happens along and looks through the
clothes, then to the table where he picks up a ridiculous
looking stuffed animal.
HIPSTER
How much is this?
ENID
That's not for sale.
HIPSTER
(noticing price tag)
Wait, it says five dollars...
ENID
Oh, that's a mistake -- I decided
not to sell it...
The HIPSTER looks around a little more and then leaves.
REBECCA
What was that all about? I thought
everything must go!
ENID
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let
some asshole with a goatee own Goofy
Gus.
A couple is browsing. The GIRL, a severely skinny, CLUBHOPPER
TYPE in platform shoes looks at the clothes; the BOY, a long
haired SKATEBOARDER, goes through her records.
GIRL
How much is this dress?
REBECCA
Oh my god, you're selling that?
ENID
(long pause)
That's five hundred dollars.
GIRL
What?
ENID
Five hundred.
GIRL
You're crazy -- it should be like
two dollars!
ENID
I was wearing that dress the day I
lost my virginity.
GIRL
Well why do I care about that?
ENID
Why do you even want it? It would
look stupid on you.
GIRL
God, fuck you!
Enid turns to the boy - he's holding some records and a book.
ENID
Put that stuff back, it's not for
sale.
BOY
What is this? Some fuckin' joke?
ENID
Yes! Go away!
They stomp off.
REBECCA
Now are you going to get a regular
job?
ENID
(defeated, quiet)
Don't worry.
REBECCA
If it makes you feel any better, I
don't think you could've gotten more
than ten bucks for all this stuff.
ENID
Yeah, thanks.
Twenty minutes later. Most of the stuff is gone. Enid packs
up one last box to carry inside.
REBECCA
Do you want to do something tonight?
ENID
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...
(suddenly)
Shit! What time is it?
I have to go
to the store! I was going to make
him a cake...
REBECCA
(miffed, sighs)
Well, are we still going shopping
tomorrow?
ENID
Yeah, I guess... call me...
She heads toward the stairs with the box. Rebecca watches
her go.
REBECCA
Since when can you make a cake?
Enid stands outside Josh's door. A tentative pause; then she
knocks. Josh opens the door, stunned. Enid is wearing an
uncharacteristically "sexy" outfit.
JOSH
Hi... what's up?
ENID
Can I come in?
Establish the restaurant.
Enid, dressed as though for a glamorous date, stands knocking
on Seymour's door.
SEYMOUR
Oh... uh, hi... What's up?
A LONG SHOT of Enid as she walks home alone.
Enid & Rebecca walk down the street. Both wear landlord
friendly J. Crew outfits.
ENID
Where are we? This is a weird
neighborhood...
REBECCA
It's a totally normal, average
neighborhood!
ENID
I just mean it's weird to me...
I've never been anywhere near here
in my life.
REBECCA
Josh says this is a really good
neighborhood...
ENID
What? When did you see Josh?!
REBECCA
He came into work.
ENID
Why? What did he say?
REBECCA
Nothing.
ENID
When was this?
REBECCA
I don't know! God, don't act so
jealous I only talked to him for two
minutes.
They walk along in conspicuous silence.
REBECCA
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you
see it?
(looks around)
That must be it...
ENID
(without enthusiasm)
Great...
REBECCA
What?! It looks totally normal...
what's wrong with it?
ENID
I said "great"...
REBECCA
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love
it!
ENID
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I
can't wait to live in some depressing
shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
REBECCA
There's something wrong with every
single place we look at! Why don't
you just come right out and tell me
you don't want to move in with me?!
ENID
Because you'll freak out and act
like a total psycho about it.
A few passersby stop to watch.
REBECCA
You're the psycho! You haven't been
able to deal with anything since
high school ended!
ENID
You're the one who's still living
out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
REBECCA
(as she walks away
giving her the finger)
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your
dad for the rest of your life!
Enid walks the streets - it's dark out now. She goes by the
Cafe - it's CLOSED FOR REMODELING.
She continues walking until she's across the street from
Norman's bus stop. She sees him there, as always. Suddenly,
a BUS, well-lit from the inside and completely empty, pulls
up to the stop and Norman gets on.
Seymour wakes up. Enid is gone.
Rebecca is nervously arranging and re-arranging her stuff.
She puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the
time to 12:45. She goes to the phone and calls Enid. The
machine picks up and Rebecca hangs up. She does another
tedious, pointless task. IT'S NOW 3:30. She's pissed off and
goes to the phone to call again. As it rings there's a knock
on the door. Relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.
REBECCA
(as she opens the
door)
What's wrong with you, retard - it's
three-thirty!
It's Seymour standing there, not Enid.
SEYMOUR
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother
told me I'd find her here?
REBECCA
She's not at home?
SEYMOUR
No... they said she was here...
REBECCA
What the fuck is she doing?! She was
supposed to be here three hours ago!
SEYMOUR
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really
need to talk to her.
REBECCA
(allows him to step
inside but leaves
the door open)
Are you sure she wasn't there?
Maybe
she was just hiding from you.
SEYMOUR
Why would she be hiding from me?
REBECCA
I don't know... where is she, then?
SEYMOUR
Maybe she's with Josh?
REBECCA
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
SEYMOUR
I don't know.
REBECCA
Why? What did she tell you?
SEYMOUR
She just mentioned him a few times
and said that they had been dating -
I thought maybe she was...
REBECCA
What? Is she having some secret affair
with Josh?
SEYMOUR
I have no idea - I just want to...
REBECCA
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no
way! She could never keep that to
herself... you're crazy.
SEYMOUR
Really, I don't know enough about it
to...
REBECCA
That slut!
SEYMOUR
(changing subject
back to me)
Why did you say she might be hiding
from me? Did she say anything to you
about me?
REBECCA
(getting revenge on
Seymour)
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
SEYMOUR
Did she say that?
REBECCA
Look, what do you expect?
Considering
how we met you.
SEYMOUR
What do you mean?
REBECCA
On that pathetic fake blind date.
SEYMOUR
What are you talking about?
REBECCA
Didn't she ever tell you about that?
God, she really is pathological...
SEYMOUR
What fake blind date? What are you
talking about?
Rebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box
and flips through it. When she gets to the right page she
hands it to Seymour.
REBECCA
Here. Read it and weep.
We see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR
in Wowsville. On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH
with his name surrounded by RED HEARTS.
Seymour's car screeches into the parking lot. He bursts into
the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene.
We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.
It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises.
She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE. It
looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands
right in front of it. She looks through the partially papered
over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures:
a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a
FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC. A sign in the window reads: "Coming
Soon: Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE.
She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm
stillness to the city. She turns a corner and is startled by
her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. She
stops and looks at herself. Everything about her looks perfect
for once; no need to change a thing. She moves closer to the
glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside.
She continues walking. Darkness is just setting in and she
has the street all to herself.
We see Enid at NORMAN'S BUS STOP, sitting on the bench. She
looks at the apartment building across the street. A woman
who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV, bathing
her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT. The same thing
happens in another window down the street... then another...
Enid looks down the street. In the distance A BUS rounds the
corner and heads toward her.
From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus
as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view. A moment
later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. The CAMERA moves
upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the
credits roll.
The bus disappears over the crest of the bridge.
