      JACK and LIZ, in a sweatshirt and ponytail, approach a 
      counter at an upscale jewelry store.  A SALESMAN is there.

                                  JACK
                    I m looking for an engagement ring.

      The salesman takes in Liz, then looks back at Jack.

                                  SALESMAN
                    Are you sure?

      Jack nods.  The salesman shrugs and goes to get the 
      engagement rings.  Liz turns to Jack, teasing.*

                                  LIZ
                    You should have had a ring the *
                    first time you proposed.  Maybe *
                    Elisa wouldn t have said  no. *

                                  JACK
                    She didn t say  no.   She said we *
                    should think about it --*

                                  LIZ*
                    Yeah, that doesn t mean  yes.   In *
                    my experience  let s think about *
                    it  ends up with me watching  Solid *

                                  JACK*
                    Well, you shouldn t have asked *
                    Chris Stanek.*

                                  LIZ*
                    But we were lab partners!*

                                  JACK
                    Wow.  The point is, I have thought *
                    about it.  And I haven t changed my *
                    mind.  In fact I ve coined a new *
                    term to describe what Elisa is to *
                    me.  She is  The One .

                                  LIZ
                     The One  is your new term?  30 ROCK 319: "The Ones"                     2.

                                  JACK
                    It means she s the only one for me.  
                    The one I m meant to be with.  Get 
                    it?   The One .

                                  LIZ
                    You should be a writer.*

      Liz reacts as the salesman returns with trays of nice rings.

                                  LIZ (CONT D)
                    Ooh, check out the bling or *
                    whatever it s called now!*

      Liz takes out a ring and immediately drops it.  She chases 
      after it out of frame.

                                  LIZ (CONT D)
                    I got it!  Oh God, there s a vent!

      The salesman and Jack watch Liz.

                                  SALESMAN
                    She s very... spirited.  Like a 
                    show horse.  You re a lucky man.

                                  JACK
                    Oh, she s not the bride.  I brought 
                    Lemon along to get a woman s 
                    opinion --

                                  LIZ (O.C.)
                    I m stuck in the vent!

      Jack pulls out a photo of Elisa and shows it to the salesman.

                                  JACK
                    This is the woman I m marrying.

                                  SALESMAN
                    My apologies, sir.  Please follow *
                    me to the real showroom.

      Jack and the salesman exit.*

      TRACY is holding court with SUE and some other WRITERS when

                    Angie met.  She was working at the 
                    Dyker Heights Arthur Treacher s and 
                    I was residing there.  She slipped 
                    me a free shrimp combo and we ve 
                    been together ever since.  This 
                    present needs to be special.  So

                    that says  Hot Bitch  in diamonds

      Toofer exit the other way.  Off to the side, a very handsome 
      EMT, ROGER, is packing up his gear and chatting with JENNA.  
      They are both being pretty flirty.

                    No, Miss Maroney, I m the one who s 
                    sorry.  It s horrible to think you 
                    might have found your true love

                      relationship was too weird not to *

      Elisa, not really thinking, grabs Liz s cheese knife.*

      Jack stops.  He and Liz share a confused look.  Why did he *
      come here?  Elisa gets it.  She deflates.*

                                  ELISA*

      stealthily crawls back in to get her cheese plate back.  *

                    Oh, it was nothing.  Sure, I was

                    did it for true love.

      Liz nods,  Fair enough,  and crosses away.  A beat.  A shadow 
      crosses past Kenneth as if someone or something has passed 
      through him.  He shivers.  Around the corner, Liz runs into *
