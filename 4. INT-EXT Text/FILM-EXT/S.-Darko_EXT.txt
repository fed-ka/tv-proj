SAMANTHA DARKO (18) opens her eyes. She squints as the summer
sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size. She sits up slowly,
looks around... and finds herself in midst of an endless
wheat field.
Sam is pretty and demure. Her coppery hair flows past her
shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite
golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in
the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful...
She smiles, and starts walking.
She emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in
Arkansas. Adjacent to her position, on the other side of the
deserted lanes, is a TRUCK STOP.
Amongst the TRACTOR-TRAILERS parked in the back lot is a
white, late-80s model CHEVROLET CELEBRITY. Sam makes her way
across the asphalt toward the vehicle...
By the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway,
steam billows out from under the hood. Sam gets out of the
car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel.
Sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the
steam. It sounds like someone is rhythmically TAPPING the
inside of the engine with a hammer.
SAM
Turn it off.
COREY
(poking her head out the
WINDOW)
What?
SAM
Turn off the car.
Corey does so.
SAM (CONT'D)
Doesn't look too good...
COREY
How do you know?
3.
SAM
It smells funny.
Sam looks up when she HEARS a PICK-UP TRUCK coming toward
them. Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down...
The pick-up pulls over ahead of them. CHRIS HOLT (24), a
brawny, attractive young man, gets out. When Corey sees him
she gets out too.
SAM (CONT'D)
Thanks for stopping. Our car's
messed up.
CHRIS
What happened?
COREY
My check engine light came on, then
it just started smoking, and
ticking and shit.
As Chris pokes around under the hood, Sam and Corey exchange
looks. Chris pops opens the COOLANT CAP and burns his hand on
the steam explosion.
CHRIS
(shaking it off)
Blew your water pump. Can't drive
it.
COREY
Fuck me...
CHRIS
El Reno's just a couple miles up
ahead. Can call for a tow there.
C'mon, I'll give you a lift.
I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/EL RENO, VARIOUS - DAY
All three crammed into the cab of the pick-up, they drive
through the center of El Reno, Oklahoma (population 16,000)
and see some of the locals out and about [MUSIC MONTAGE
fueled by early- to mid-90s era GRUNGE ROCK (suggestion: Come
As You Are, by Nirvana) -- reminiscent of the `Middlesex
Middle School Montage' in DONNIE DARKO]:
AGATHA DOWDY (54), an employee of the local DINER, sits on a
bench in front of the establishment smoking a cigarette. The
manager, TED MONCTON (50), calls her back inside...
4.
RANDY EVANS (21), RUTH GIBBENS (18) and JEFF (21) and MIKE
JIMENEZ (20) loiter in the parking lot of a LIQUOR STORE...
TRUDY POTTER (39) flirts with FATHER HOMEIJER (54), a
Catholic priest, outside the BANK. A BANK SIGN shows the TIME
-- 12:00 PM -- then flashes to the DATE -- JUNE 18, 1995...
OFFICER RYAN O'DELL (31) has pulled over a PRETTY LADY and
uses his uniform to impress more than intimidate...
They come up on VIETNAM TOM (48), who ambles along the side
of the road against traffic, and he waves to them as they
pass. He wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi-
colored SKI MASK over his head and face...
[END MONTAGE]
Sam swivels her head to watch Tom. ANOTHER CAR passes and he
waves to it as well. Chris picks up on her curiosity.
CHRIS
He waves to everybody... Just kinda
walks up and down.
COREY
Resident nutcase?
CHRIS
People call him Vietnam Tom.
SAM
He was in the war?
CHRIS
He thinks he was... kind of a joke,
ya know?
Sam continues to stare until he disappears out of sight...
PAN DOWN to a PUDDLE by the side of the road. As a CAR TIRE
splashes through it, PAN UP TO FIND:
I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Dusty's auto repair shop, which is nothing more than a big
garage attached to his old two-story house. Corey's car has
been towed there, and DUSTY GIBBENS (37; father of Ruth
Gibbens), the lone mechanic, tinkers around under the hood.
Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting,
bored as hell. A PIT BULL laps at a nameless treat wedged
into a crack in the walkway. The girls are forced to get up
when Ruth (from outside the liquor store) comes to the door.
5.
RUTH
Can I get out?
Sam and Corey move so that she can exit the house. Ruth's
look is hardened, rough around the edges -- she appears older
than her 18 years.
The girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father.
She whispers something in his ear, and Dusty hands her some
CASH, which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek. After
this, Dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes
outside to address Corey and Sam.
DUSTY
Yeah... it's the water pump.
COREY
So what do we do?
DUSTY
I can order you up a new one.
Probably be a couple days.
COREY
Great. This the only show in town?
DUSTY
Cheapest and the best. But you want
me to call the tow guy back here,
no problem. Probably charge you
another hundred bucks, but he'll
get ya wherever you wanna go.
COREY
Just go ahead and fix it.
Sam and Corey arrive at the liquor store, which is down the
street from the motel. Ruth, Randy Evans, and Jeff and Mike
Jimenez are loitering in the parking lot in a similar fashion
to how they were earlier in the day.
RUTH
You get checked into the motel
alright?
COREY
Yep.
Randy seems surprised that Ruth has already made their
acquaintance. He wastes no time in introducing himself.
RANDY
My name's Randy. This is Mike and
Jeff. Guess you already know Ruth.
COREY
Corey.
SAM
I'm Samantha.
They shake, and Corey seems at ease mingling with the
strangers. Sam hangs back a little.
COREY
One of you guys mind pickin' us up
a bottle of something?
RANDY
I think I can manage that. What do
you want?
7.
COREY
I don't know. Vodka, whiskey,
whatever.
Corey looks to Sam, who produces some cash. Randy takes the
money and heads for the store.
RANDY
Be right back...
After he's gone, there's an uncomfortable moment of silence
in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously. Ruth
stares at them in a different way. She seems somewhat
resentful of their presence.
RUTH
From Virginia, huh?
COREY
Yep.
RUTH
I saw your plates...
Corey and Sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment. Another
beat of uncomfortable silence.
RUTH (CONT'D)
Where to?
COREY
What?
RUTH
Your obviously just passin' through
here.
SAM
We're on the way to Vegas.
Ruth snickers.
RUTH
Well... you need anything besides
booze, you just lemme know.
Randy comes out of the store with a bottle in a brown bag. He
passes it off to Corey, along with some change.
COREY
Thanks a lot, man.
8.
RANDY
No problem. You guys wanna come
back to my place for bit? Bring
your bottle, we got some weed...
Corey looks like she's considering it, but --
SAM
I'm really tired.
She takes Sam's signal.
COREY
Yeah, I think we'll just head back.
Been a long day, ya know?
RANDY
That's cool.
The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to --
JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown
to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29
MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...
Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from
the building. She wears a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, JEANS, and her
RIGHT HAND is wrapped in some sort of MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
9.
There's a GASH in the side of her forehead by her temple,
with what looks to be a SHARD OF METAL partially embedded
under the skin and protruding from the wound.
She is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and
fluid. A tall AERMOTOR WINDMILL towers in the distance...
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE GRASSY FIELD
A glimpse of the field through Sam's eyes shows a
phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in which
objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions,
and move according to a framework of set paths.
A JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic
life-gel to its burrow... COSMIC ENERGY burns around a
CLUSTER OF STONES... Miniature VECTOR SPEARS lead a SWARM OF
INSECTS around in a circle and then BUZZING right past Sam's
field of vision...
It's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly. She
has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is
cognizant of her path... She moves toward the WINDMILL.
Sam appears at the foot of the windmill tower. A giant WATER
TANK squats beside it. Remaining stoic, she looks up and sees
Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform, more than 30
feet up, staring back down at her through the eyes holes of
his ski mask...
ANGLE: WINDMILL PLATFORM
Tom peers over the edge of the small platform, the surface of
which is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE,
CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. He cradles a RIFLE in his
arms...
His focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to
what is sitting right beside him --
REVEAL Sam. Her legs dangle over the side of the platform,
and she stares off into distance.
SAM
The sky's so beautiful here...
Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at
her. Sam turns to meet his gaze...
10.
SAM (CONT'D)
But we can't stay.
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - VIETNAM TOM
Sam sees through to the core of his physical being, the
DYNAMIC CENTER of which lingers pulsating in a translucent
circle around his chest.
Magnified NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN send ELECTRIC IMPULSES that
release NEUROTRANSMITTERS, which excite OTHER NEURONS...
Tom slowly reaches out to touch Sam, but an invisible FORCE
FIELD makes contact impossible. RIPPLES swell throughout the
clear plasma-like barrier from where he touched it, and his
hand remains glued to the spot.
Sam extends her bandaged right hand, and presses it to
Vietnam Tom's as if she were touching a mirrored image of
herself.
The contact generates more RIPPLES, and as TREMORS begin to
shake the windmill a DISTORTED VOICE echoes throughout the
COSMOS:
DISTORTED VOICE (V.O.)
15 days... 18 hours... 45
minutes... 6 seconds. That is when
the world will end.
A CYLINDRICAL PORTAL opens up below them, gaping and swirling
like God's eye on the mouth of a liquid tornado. As Sam and
Tom stand in unison to peer into it, a HEXAGONAL PLATE OF
WHITE LIGHT emanates from within --
They appear near the foot of the windmill, sprinting away
from it together. Tom has his rifle, and he looks up to the
sky as he runs...
...there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening
THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION --
Sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her. She struggles to
peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that
stands over her. Her eyes adjust to discover that it's a
policeman -- Officer O'Dell.
11.
OFFICER O'DELL
`Fraid you can't sleep here, miss.
Sam sits up and realizes she's on a bench at a bus stop near
the side of the road. O'Dell's tone is innocuous, and when
she looks up at him again she sees that he's grinning.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
Got anyplace to be?
Sam manages to find her voice.
SAM
The motel.
She takes his hand and rises.
I/E. O'DELL'S CRUISER/MOTEL - MORNING
O'Dell's cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot, which is
uncharacteristically full. A FIRE TRUCK is parked by the side
of the road. Just then, a call comes in on the POLICE RADIO:
DISPATCH (V.O.)
We got some kinda situation at
Frank Haley's farm...
OFFICER O'DELL
Copy that. I'm here now...
Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER
about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits
of wood and metal strewn everywhere. GROUND WATER spurts from
the broken WELL SEAL...
And a cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
crater.
Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as Sam
and O'Dell arrive on the scene. Corey is already there
looking on, as well as Chris Holt, who gave them a ride into
town, Phil Coulter from the motel, and other local CITIZENS.
FRANK HALEY (54), the farmer who owns the land, is fuming.
FRANK
Un-fuckin'-believable...
The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.
12.
FIREMAN #1
It's still warm.
FRANK
You know how much it's gonna cost
me to replace this goddamn
windmill?
Officer O'Dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite
with his boot.
OFFICER O'DELL
Sell this thing off to some
meteorologist nerd club, I bet you
could do okay.
FRANK
Ya think?
Sam looks down at a CAN OF FOOD on the ground amidst some
scorched CLOTHING. O'Dell takes note of some other CANNED
GOODS and SCRAPS OF TARP.
OFFICER O'DELL
What's all that stuff, Frank?
FRANK
That whack job Tom's been squattin'
up there the last couple a' months.
Thinks he's the goddamn town
watchman...
(BEAT)
You think he got blown up?
Everyone scans the ground for signs of human remains until
Phil pipes up:
PHIL
I saw him out in front of the motel
early this morning, alive and well.
FRANK
(SARCASTIC)
Oh, well, thank heavens...
Sam turns and peers up at the WATER TANK. It's marred by BURN
MARKS and DENTS from the explosion. As she tilts her head and
looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the
damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin...
...in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANT
MONSTER BUNNY.
13.
Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when
they turn and see that Chris has followed them.
CHRIS
Hey...
SAM
Hey.
CHRIS
So you guys stayed here last night?
COREY
One of us did.
Sam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment.
CHRIS
What's up with your car?
COREY
It's gonna take a couple days.
CHRIS
For a water pump?
Sam and Corey shrug.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
None of my business, but...
He's distracted when a brand new `95 BMW pulls up and parks
nearby. JEREMY FRAME (25), a thin, pale young man hops out
and hustles into the field toward the crash site.
SAM
What?
Chris regains his train of thought:
CHRIS
I was just gonna say, if you
wanted, I could give you a ride
back.
He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over
at Corey, as if just remembering she was there.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
You too. I mean, I could give you
both a ride.
14.
COREY
To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you have
any clue how far that is?
CHRIS
(SHEEPISH)
I got some time...
Sam looks as though she's about to say something but Corey
overpowers her.
COREY
We're not goin' back. Even El
Reno's better than there.
Chris makes eye contact with Sam again. She maintains it for
a moment and then looks away.
Vietnam Tom explores a cluttered junkyard, gathering
materials. He scours amongst the PILES OF REFUSE, RUSTY
MACHINES and crumbling STORAGE SHACKS.
He bends to pick up a SCRAP OF METAL and adds it to a
collection he's making in a worn SATCHEL...
As Sam and Corey are about to enter the diner, Trudy Potter,
a bank teller, is on her way out.
The girls move to the side so she can exit, and take notice
of a MISSING PERSONS SIGN posted next to the door -- BILLY
MOORCROFT'S (10) dark, empty eyes stare at them from the
BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.
TRUDY (O.S.)
Isn't that just awful?
Trudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders.
TRUDY (CONT'D)
His poor mother...
Each licking an ICE CREAM CONE, Corey and Sam walk past the
home of Father Homeijer. The priest is outside working in his
flower garden, wearing his CLERICAL COLLAR. An old CATHOLIC
CHURCH rests on the same lot as his house, looming behind it.
When Father Homeijer sees the girls walking by, he rises from
his work, takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his
forehead. Sam and Corey both notice him eyeballing them.
COREY
What's his problem?
18.
SAM
Just keep walking.
Corey waves to him in a sarcastic, exaggerated manner... The
priest doesn't wave back, but continues to gawk at them until
they go around the corner.
COREY
Freak...
Vietnam Tom crouches in a decrepit SHACK covered by a piece
of CORRUGATED ROOFING. He works with great focus, arranging
VARIOUS BITS OF METAL into some sort of small SCULPTURE...
Having finished their ice creams, the girls pass the liquor
store on the way back to the motel. They find Randy, Ruth,
Jeff and Mike at their usual post.
RANDY
Hey, what's up?
COREY
Not much... just getting stared
down by creepy priest boy back
there.
JEFF
Father Homeijer?
MIKE
Don't worry, you're a little old
for his taste.
JEFF
Yeah, he's a fuckin' perv.
COREY
(to Randy)
You got an extra cigarette?
Randy takes a pack from his pocket and offers her one.
RANDY
I'm throwin' a big party at my
house tonight, you guys should come
by. No excuses this time...
Sam and Corey look at each other, considering.
19.
RANDY (CONT'D)
You're gonna be stuck in El Reno,
you might as well have some fun,
right?
The party at Randy's teems with LOCALS, ages ranging from
early teens to late-20s. On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER
and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC. There's a slimy-looking POOL,
and a few people swim in the greenish water.
Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair. They stop off so
Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS. Corey and Sam
hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer.
COREY
You guys gotta come visit the club
when we get all set up. We'll give
you the VIP treatment, man...
Mike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition.
MIKE
Sounds good to me.
COREY
Give us a little time, me and
Sam'll be runnin' that place, no
doubt... right?
SAM
Yeah. Definitely.
Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam
appears more out of place. She drains the better part of her
cup for some liquid courage.
Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer
O'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. Ruth
notices him first.
RUTH
Fuck.
RANDY
What?
RUTH
That pig, O'Dell.
20.
RANDY
Don't worry about Ryan. He might be
a cop, but he still likes to party.
Randy's theory is proven when O'Dell takes a FLASK from his
pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of TEENAGE
GIRLS... But Ruth is still not satisfied.
RUTH
I think that asshole knows I deal.
You know how fucked that is?
RANDY
From what I hear he's got a little
somethin' goin' on the side
himself.
RUTH
Fucking pig's a pig.
They're all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into
the pool and splashes them.
MIKE
JEFF
Fuck!
Bastard!
SAM
What the hell...
Sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants. Ruth
watches her, smirking.
RANDY
We might as well all go in now,
we're already wet.
RUTH
Good idea...
Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool --
ANGLE: BENEATH THE WATER
She sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION. All SOUNDS are
DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil, completely detached.
Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS
glimmering beyond the surface of the water... TRANSITION TO:
21.
A HAND reaches into the pool, grabs onto Sam's arm and pulls
her up --
She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath --
back to reality. She sees that Randy is the one responsible
for pulling her out.
RANDY
You fall asleep down there?
He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing.
Sam is lost in thought, struck by her vision...
She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and
jump into the pool beside her. Many of the PARTYGOERS hoot in
approval, and Randy, Mike and Jeff strip down and leap in
right behind her.
Sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps
are, and fewer people. When she arrives there, she's
surprised to find Chris Holt waiting for her with a towel.
CHRIS
Thought you could maybe use this.
As Chris hands her the towel, he notices a wide SCAR on the
inside of Sam's RIGHT WRIST... but doesn't mention it. Sam
wraps the towel around her sopping wet body.
Corey looks over and sees her getting out...
Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.
CHRIS
So what's so wrong at home that you
had to take off?
The question takes Sam by surprise.
22.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
I'd love to get outta here someday
too... just don't know quite where
I'd go.
Sam decides to open up a little.
SAM
I hate it there. It's like everyone
knows everything about me, but I'm
invisible at the same time. It's
like the worst of both worlds.
CHRIS
Small towns. How `bout your family?
SAM
They didn't want me to leave...
well, they did, but they wanted me
to go away to Harvard or something
like that, like my sister.
Sam takes a big sip of her beer, showing signs of tipsiness.
SAM (CONT'D)
Sometimes I think it would've been
easier if... I just, after my
BROTHER-
Sam stops herself.
CHRIS
What?
SAM
(changing gears)
That's why I love Corey, she just
doesn't give a shit. She does what
she wants and she doesn't care what
people think.
CHRIS
You just gotta be yourself, that's
all. What is it you wanna do
exactly?
SAM
I always thought I'd be a dancer,
like in a troupe or something...
Sam is self-conscious after admitting this.
SAM (CONT'D)
That sounds kinda stupid probably.
23.
CHRIS
No...
SAM
When I was younger, my dance team
was on Star Search.
CHRIS
Really?
SAM
Yeah... but I didn't go.
CHRIS
Why not?
SAM
I didn't end up dancing in the
talent show where they got
discovered... I didn't really feel
like it at the time anyway.
CHRIS
Huh...
SAM
But that's why we're going to
Vegas. There's lots of
opportunities there.
Chris glances over to the pool where Corey is topless,
splashing and goofing around with some BOYS.
CHRIS
(SMIRKING)
Yeah, good place for it. Gettin'
some practice on the way, too.
Sam takes offense, getting drunk and sensitive.
SAM
Is that supposed to be like some
kind of judgement or something?
CHRIS
No, I was just-
She takes her beer and storms away from him.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Sam, wait... hey, come on...
24.
Sam finds a STOOP at the side of the house where she can be
alone. She can HEAR the PARTY going on in the backyard, but
no one else is in sight.
Still soaking wet, she plants herself on the stoop and starts
to pound the rest of her drink...
A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's. A
lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an
orange glow.
She is completely dry, wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and
JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right
hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her
forehead...
A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing
her by inches. She sits up slowly and looks toward the front
of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away.
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYS
Two DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex,
phosphorescent grid that is Sam's field of vision. VECTOR
SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements
as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR, insert a SIPHON,
and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE.
DRUNK GUY #1
Hurry up...
Although she is close by, they take no notice of Sam
whatsoever. ANOTHER CAR speeds by, again nearly crushing her,
but she doesn't flinch...
She stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side
of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone
who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a
DITCH near a CULVERT --
ANGLE: CULVERT
Sam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch. Tom stares at
her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask.
25.
From one end of the broad, open culvert they can see straight
through to the other side...
A PORTAL starts to take shape within, swirling around the
circumference. Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the
phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong
enough to make them falter.
On the opposite end of the culvert, a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT
flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of
FATHER HOMEIJER'S CHURCH --
Tom and Sam stand outside the church. The STEEPLE reigns over
them. Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS
and approach the great WOOD DOORS...
Sam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her face.
She's lying on the floor of the motel room in between the
beds.
She's alone, and naked except for the sheet. Her WET CLOTHES
are in a heap beside her. Her head is throbbing...
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
She scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR...
I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
Having thrown on some wrinkled clothes, Sam opens the door to
find Phil, the motel owner. He does not look pleased.
PHIL
You plannin' on checkin' out today?
SAM
(GROGGY)
Uh... I, I don't know yet.
PHIL
Well, it's already way past
checkout time, so you'd better
figure it out quick.
SAM
I've just gotta find Corey... and
check on the car.
27.
PHIL
You do whatever you have to, but if
you're stayin' another night I
wanna see some money up front.
Sam approaches the bank, and when she sees the tall SIGN with
the digital clock, she stops and stares up at it. It strikes
a chord but she doesn't know why...
The sign reads 12:48 PM -- and then -- JUNE 20, 1995. It
changes to the FIREWORKS COUNTDOWN: 14 DAYS, 8 HOURS, 11
MINUTES, 22 SECONDS... 21 SECONDS...
As Sam comes out of the bank Jeremy rolls up in his BMW and
parks in the lot. He gets out and approaches her.
JEREMY
Hi there.
SAM
Hey.
JEREMY
I didn't get your name at the
diner.
SAM
I'm Sam.
JEREMY
Jeremy.
They shake, and Jeremy holds her hand for a little longer
than what is generally comfortable.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
So what are you up to?
SAM
Trying to get money... not very
successfully.
JEREMY
I've gotta pick up some cash too.
Need some supplies for the lab. I
don't think I've even slept since I
got my hands on that meteorite. You
should come by the lab with me and
check it out.
SAM
I can't...
Sam starts to walk away from him.
30.
JEREMY
I could let you borrow some
money... if you need some.
SAM
I don't even know you.
JEREMY
That's okay. I trust you.
SAM
Thanks anyway.
JEREMY
You're sure you don't want to check
out the lab?
SAM
Sorry... I've gotta find Corey.
Sam turns to leave.
JEREMY
Maybe some other time.
I/E. RANDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON
Corey rides shotgun in Randy's car, chewing on some greasy
FAST FOOD, looking quite content. Randy is behind the wheel
with a BEER in his hand, and Mike, Jeff and Ruth are packed
All three are bent drastically forward, sagging down toward
the murky ground...
OFFICER O'DELL (O.S.)
Musta' melted from the heat.
Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside
himself with bitterness and sorrow.
FATHER HOMEIJER
They're made of silver-plated
steel. A simple fire couldn't do
that.
OFFICER O'DELL
What are you sayin'?
FATHER HOMEIJER
This is an extension of Satan's own
hand... I've seen it coming.
Rolling his eyes, O'Dell walks away, leaving the priest to
grieve for his church in private.
Vietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but
progress has been made...
It has begun to take on a recognizable form: a GROTESQUE
COUNTENANCE with TWO LONG EARS, BULGING EYES and a devilish,
TOOTHY GRIN...
AFTERNOON
Sam is walking in front of a DEPARTMENT STORE when Randy's
car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the
passenger side window.
COREY
What happened to you?
32.
SAM
What happened to me...? Where the
hell've you been?
COREY
I crashed at Randy's. We just got
food. Want a burger?
SAM
My stomach's fucked up.
JEFF
MIKE
Awww...
Poor tummy...
Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers.
SAM (CONT'D)
We gotta talk about what we're
gonna do.
COREY
Don't worry about it so much.
SAM
The motel guy came to the room this
morning all pissed off. We're
probably not even gonna have enough
money to pay for the car.
Corey sighs, debating weather or not to get out. Before she
can reach a decision, something in the department store's
parking lot catches her eye: a LITTLE BOY with dark hair,
wearing a BIRTHDAY HAT...
But she blinks and he's gone, having disappeared between two
parked vehicles.
Confused, Corey rubs her eyes and gets out of the car.
RANDY
Should I wait a minute?
JEFF
We gotta get some smokes...
COREY
Just go ahead. I'll catch up with
you later on.
RANDY
Alright. Later.
Corey gets out and shuts the door. Randy speeds off toward an
intersection about 20 yards ahead...
33.
Sam and Corey meander toward the intersection where Randy's
car is stopped at a red light.
SAM
We just gotta figure out what we're
gonna do. I don't think-
COREY
(ABRUPT)
Lemme guess, you wanna go home.
SAM
What?
COREY
You wanna run back to mommy and
daddy and say sorry so they can put
you through college. Well that's
real big of you, Sam, but I don't
have that option.
SAM
(taken aback)
What are you talking about?
COREY
I'll go home and get the shit
kicked out of me, and get my ass
grabbed by my mom's boyfriend...
They're almost to the light, which is still red, and coming
up on Randy's car. Jeff, Mike and Ruth stare out at them from
the backseat, smelling the drama.
COREY (CONT'D)
I knew you'd bail on me eventually,
but not this quick.
SAM
I'm not bailing on you. Would you
JUST-
34.
COREY
You can fucking sleepwalk back to
Middlesex for all I care. I'm not
driving you... you're a fucking
drag.
The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
intersection, making a left...
SAM
Fuck you, Corey.
Sam wheels on her and steps out into the street, storming
straight across. Corey starts to follow... but something
stops her in her tracks: BILLY MOORCROFT.
He stands on the opposite side of the intersection, in the
trajectory that Sam is walking -- but Sam doesn't see him.
Billy wears a BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He
looks pale and weak, and is covered with BRUISES. He stares
right back at Corey, as transfixed as she is... TIME SLOWS
DOWN. [Note: Sam's position is in the middle of the road.
Randy's car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of
the intersection.]
Bewildered, Corey tries to step out into the street but
something blocks her -- an invisible FORCE FIELD makes
forward progress impossible.
RIPPLES swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit
it. She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and
watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into
infinite space.
She reaches forth with her hand, wanting to feel the barrier
once again... Just as she touches it... REAL TIME RESUMES --
KA-BOOM!
FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the JALOPY hits on the
front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet --
-- AND STRIKES SAM RIGHT IN THE HEAD!
35.
The world goes SILENT.
CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT
USED TO BE...
SAM'S BODY IS CRUMPLED IN THE STREET, MOTIONLESS...
BILLY MOORCROFT IS GONE. THE FORCE FIELD IS GONE. COREY
STANDS FROZEN, HORRIFIED... IN UTTER SHOCK.
Corey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a
secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-
depressants.
She is frightened when she notices a PAIR OF EYES staring at
her from the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's
wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle.
Corey backs away as Tom slowly creeps toward her... She's
about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the
police station behind her.
CHRIS
Get the hell outta here.
Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris.
Tom shuffles away.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Should know better than to be
carrying his rifle around town like
that...
Corey takes a breath, recovering from her scare.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
You okay?
COREY
What're you doing here?
CHRIS
I had to put in a statement too.
Can I give you a lift?
I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING
Chris and Corey pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've
gotten Corey's prescription filled, and she has the BOTTLE OF
PILLS in her hand.
CHRIS
I'm real sorry about Sam.
Corey nods.
38.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
It's such a waste. Just a horrible,
freak thing.
COREY
I said some pretty shitty things to
her right before it happened.
CHRIS
I'm sure she knew you didn't mean
it.
Corey gets out of the car and walks toward the motel room.
Corey follows the distinctive CRYING toward the VENDING
MACHINES on the side of the building...
...until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them. Corey
freezes a few feet away from the boy, who wears the BIRTHDAY
HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He is pale and bruised.
Corey sees that he is not crying -- it's coming from
elsewhere in the cosmos, far away. The WAILS taper off to a
faint, DISTORTED WHISPER as Billy speaks:
BILLY MOORCROFT
You need to save me, Corey.
Corey stares at him in disbelief.
BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
You need to save me... and save the
world.
COREY
Why can't anyone see you?
BILLY MOORCROFT
If you tell them about me they'll
think you're a dummy.
COREY
Why me?
BILLY MOORCROFT
I didn't pick you. Just like you
didn't pick me either.
Corey stands before him in awe, transfixed.
BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
We shouldn't even be here. Nobody
should...
Corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him. Where
the prices should be, NUMBERS flash in a rhythm that seems to
coincide with the ululations of the distant CRYING: 2...
10... 16... 44... -end-... 2... 10... 16... 44... -end-...
40.
BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
You don't have much time.
Corey is about to respond when the sound of a DOOR OPENING
stops her. The FLASHING NUMBERS on the vending machines go
back to normal PRICES, the CRYING SOUND CEASES, and Billy
disappears.
PHIL (O.S.)
What's goin' on out here?
Corey looks over and sees Phil dressed in nightclothes,
having come out of a room near the lobby. She's dumbstruck.
COREY
Nothing... I-I don't know.
PHIL
Go back to your room and get some
sleep. You've had a tough day.
Phil goes back inside, leaving her alone.
Corey waits on the cement steps by the loading dock. She
shoots up when Chris comes out the back entrance with a
PLASTIC BAG...
41.
Corey takes it from him and looks inside: CANDY BARS, a BAG
OF CHIPS, some PEANUTS, a pack of CIGARETTES.
COREY
Thanks.
She tears open the cigarettes and lights one. Chris lights up
one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking.
CHRIS
Shouldn't you go back home?
COREY
There's nothing for me to go home
to. Trust me.
CHRIS
What about Sam's funeral?
Corey looks conflicted, but she takes a harsh stance:
COREY
What's the point? She's gone,
that's it. Nothing's gonna change
that...
Chris lets it go.
COREY (CONT'D)
Is there a library around here?
CHRIS
(PUZZLED)
Yeah... you need a book?
COREY
Is it walking distance?
CHRIS
I can take you.
COREY
I think I'd rather walk.
Corey and Chris stroll together along a quiet street.
CHRIS
So you guys were real close, huh.
42.
COREY
When I moved to Virginia Sam was
like the only person I could even
stand to talk to.
CHRIS
How long had you been plannin' your
trip together?
COREY
Not too long... kind of a last
minute thing. It was good timing,
`cause I don't like to stay in one
place for too long, ya know?
CHRIS
Huh...
COREY
I was really surprised when Sam
wanted to come, actually. I just
kinda brought it up one day, and
she was down...
Corey reflects for a beat.
COREY (CONT'D)
If it wasn't for me, she'd still be
alive right now.
CHRIS
You can't think like that.
COREY
It's true, isn't it?
Chris doesn't respond.
Corey follows Billy, who walks in the middle of the road
about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is
guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side.
The dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in
space-time materializes.
There's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF
THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive,
swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter-
dimensional realm of darkest night.
54.
The VOID brightens, and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL
RAINS are visible within...
Corey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTY'S HOUSE
AND AUTO REPAIR SHOP being doused and beaten by the STORM --
-- WATER POURS out from under the garage door down to the
street. PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
55.
The entire driveway and the street in front of the house are
covered with water. FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE
are gathered in front of the property.
ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET
Ruth runs toward her house. When she turns a corner and it
comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks. Her face shows
sheer terror --
Because her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into
the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another
policeman, OFFICER HINES...
...the PIT BULL struggles against it's CHAIN, growling and
barking frantically.
...and Billy Moorcroft, half-naked, soaking wet and
shivering, is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by
PARAMEDICS.
FIREMAN #2
Lucky I heard him screamin', else
he woulda drowned down there.
Ruth keeps to the shadows and slinks toward a BACK DOOR...
Having deposited Dusty in the back of the cruiser and shut
the door, O'Dell's attention turns to an upstairs window of
the house when he sees MOVEMENT.
Corey waits behind the store until Chris comes out. She
eagerly accepts TWO PACKS.
CHRIS
D'ya hear the news?
COREY
What?
CHRIS
They found that Billy Moorcroft
kid. He was at Dusty's house...
Corey is floored.
57.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Sick bastard had him locked up in
the basement. I can't believe we
were just over there yesterday.
Corey can't help it... A grin spreads across her face.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
I guess he's gonna be okay-
COREY
Everything's gonna be okay.
Corey cuts him off, and Chris looks at her strangely.
COREY (CONT'D)
I'm not crazy. I think everything's
gonna be okay.
Billy walks through the empty park, still wearing his
birthday hat. He makes his way past a SAND PIT with a JUNGLE
GYM.
Balanced on one of the jungle gym's bars is a PRESCRIPTION
BOTTLE...
Billy picks it up. The name on the prescription is COREY
RICHARDSON. JUMP CUT TO:
The SWING SET. Billy leans back as far as he can as momentum
propels his body forward and back through space. He looks up
to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming...
He swings back and forth... back and forth...
ANGLE: PARK BENCH
Corey sits nearby on a park bench, watching Billy. He looks
back at her, showing no signs of recognition... JUMP CUT TO:
The SWING. No longer a little boy sitting in it. It dangles
erratically from the ropes, still gripped by inertia...
PAN DOWN to the sandy ground below -- FIND the bottle of
pills, now empty. Billy's unmoving, OPEN HAND...
A TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK gets off the highway and heads into
El Reno. It's load is a batch of beat up, OLD CARS.
The JALOPY is on the TOP RACK, CLOSEST TO THE END...
Randy peeks in the window of Corey's motel room but sees
nothing. He pounds on the door and calls for her:
RANDY
Corey...
Corey arrives near the intersection where the accident took
place. The BLACK CLOUDS overhead have become more vast and
oppressive. A cold WIND blows...
61.
The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK breaches the crest of a hill and
comes into view, descending on the intersection.
Above it the CLOUDS begin to transform and take the shape of
an ASTRONOMICAL WORMHOLE that reaches down toward the
earth...
Chris comes outside and gazes up at the foreboding sky...
As the TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK approaches the intersection,
Corey fixates on the JALOPY on the back...
CLOSE ANGLE: JALOPY
The CHAINS that hold the junker in place SHAKE and RATTLE...
We plunge through the PORTAL as it twists through the
ether...
The WORMHOLE extends down to the JALOPY. Gracefully. Like an
eel moving through water, confidently pursuing it's prey...
mouth widening to swallow...
Corey is riveted.
As it passes through the intersection, the TRACTOR-TRAILER
hits a POTHOLE -- CUT TO:
KEY SCENES IN REVERSE
PILLS COME OUT OF BILLY'S MOUTH AND INTO HIS HAND --
HIS DRAWING OF THE SWING SET STARTS TO DECONSTRUCT --
RUTH'S COCAINE FLIES OUT OF THE SWIRLING TOILET WATER --
DUSTY STEPS BACKWARDS OUT OF THE POLICE CRUISER --
RUTH'S EYE CLOSES BEFORE COREY'S FOOT STEPS OFF OF HERS --
62.
COREY STEPS AWAY FROM THE KURT COBAIN POSTER WITH `I'M NOT
AFRAID OF DYING' SCRAWLED ON IT --
MICROFILM PAGES FLIP BACKWARDS --
PICTURES OF THE DARKO FAMILY ARE PUT BACK INTO THE PHILOSOPHY
OF TIME TRAVEL BOOK -- TRANSITION TO:
AFTERNOON
Sam is walking in front of the department store when Randy's
car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the
passenger side window.
COREY
What happened to you?
SAM
What happened to me...? Where the
hell've you been?
COREY
I crashed at Randy's. We just got
food. Want a burger?
SAM
My stomach's fucked up.
JEFF
MIKE
Awww...
Poor tummy...
Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers.
SAM (CONT'D)
We gotta talk about what we're
gonna do.
COREY
Don't worry about it so much.
SAM
The motel guy came to the room this
MORNING-
COREY
(INTERRUPTING)
I don't give a fuck.
SAM
Excuse me?
63.
COREY
I said, I. Don't. Give. A. Fuck...
She annunciates every word like a true bitch.
COREY (CONT'D)
I'm tired of listening to you whine
about everything.
Giggles from the peanut gallery in the car.
SAM
Corey, you're still drunk. Don't be
a fuck-ass.
JEFF
Did she just call her a fuck-ass?
MIKE
What's a fuck-ass?
Everyone cracks up, including Corey. Sam is humiliated. She
backs away from the car, anger burning in her eyes. Randy
revs the engine, expressing his will to take off.
COREY
See ya later, Sam.
Sam says nothing, but watches as Randy's car peels off toward
the intersection. She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot
where she's standing.
As Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades...
Randy's car is stopped at the red light. Sam strolls toward
it ever so slowly. Jeff, Mike and Ruth gawk at her from the
backseat.
She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting
herself to any more of their mockery...
The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
intersection, making a left. Sam's still 10 or 15 feet away
from stepping into the street...
She quickens her pace, almost there when --
KA-BOOM!
FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the jalopy hits on the
front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and
skitters harmlessly across the intersection --
The world goes SILENT.
CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT
USED TO BE...
THE JALOPY IS FLIPPED OVER ONTO ITS SIDE...
SAM STANDS PEERING AT THE WRECKAGE... THE AREA OF THE CAR
WHERE COREY WAS SITTING IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT. SHE DROPS
TO HER KNEES.
Sam walks out of the police station and finds herself in the
secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-
depressants...
A pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by -- it's
Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his
rifle. He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him.
Sam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom
watches her with empathy. It looks as though he's about to go
to her when something stops him -- Chris comes out the door.
CHRIS
You okay?
Sam is still too choked up to speak. Tom sneaks away
unnoticed...
Sam wanders through the junkyard clad in her HOODED
SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped
around her right hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the
GASH by her temple.
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE JUNKYARD
She sees the junkyard as the phosphorescent DESTINY PLANE.
DEAD CARS, MACHINERY and piles of SCRAP METAL glow as
stationary objects within the complex grid. A PAIR OF RATS
follow their VECTOR SPEARS as they shimmy up the side of a
RUSTY TRACTOR...
Sam treads effortlessly through the darkness, past the heaps
of junk toward the decrepit STORAGE SHACK marked by the
CORRUGATED ROOFING...
ANGLE: STORAGE SHACK
She stands before the shack, having discovered Vietnam Tom.
He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and
looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask --
68.
He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which
has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY.
SAM
Hi, Tom. I like your new mask.
Tom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as Sam
runs her fingers down one of the LONG, METALLIC EARS, down to
one of the SHARPENED INCISORS of the EVIL-LOOKING GRIN...
SAM (CONT'D)
Are you scared?
As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes
transparent, and the NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN can be seen
sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES, in turn RELEASING
NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS...
SAM (CONT'D)
I know you can hear me...
A PORTAL forms around the shelter like a giant cylinder,
enclosing them. Tom rises, afraid... Sam takes his hand...
The PORTAL shrinks and squeezes the walls until they bend
inward, then begin to CREAK and RUMBLE --
Sam awakens to a fierce RUMBLING overhead.
It happens again, and when she looks around she realizes that
she's underneath a highway overpass in BOXER SHORTS and a T-
SHIRT, barefoot, lying on a FLAT AREA atop the CEMENT SLOPE
that leads down to the road below.
Alarmed by both the height and sanitation of her current
position, she shifts her body and starts to slide down the
SLOPE...
Once on even ground, she notices a brand new `95 BMW coming
toward her.
SAM
Perfect...
Jeremy pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.
JEREMY
Sam? Are you okay? What are doing?
SAM
I'm... yeah, I'm okay.
69.
Jeremy gets out of the car and puts his hand on her shoulder.
JEREMY
You shouldn't be out here like
this. C'mon, get in.
She allows herself to be led to the passenger side...
Some WORKERS are in the process of
rebuilding the WINDMILL. A
MAN WITH A HOSE sprays the side of
the WATER TANK in an
attempt to wash off the burn marks
resembling the nearly
imperceptible image of the MONSTER
BUNNY'S FACE...
70.
I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/MOTEL - MORNING
Jeremy pulls into the motel parking lot. Sam hesitates for a
moment before getting out.
JEREMY
I heard about your friend...
Sam doesn't say anything, so he goes on.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
I wasn't gonna say anything... but
then I thought I probably should,
because if I didn't, it might be
inconsiderate.
SAM
Well... okay. Thanks.
A beat.
JEREMY
So... what are you gonna do?
SAM
I don't know yet.
Sam brushes her mussed hair out of her face, still not
wanting to go inside the motel room.
SAM (CONT'D)
Do you believe that everything
happens for a reason?
JEREMY
I know that for every action
there's an equal and opposite
reaction.
SAM
Yeah... I learned that in science.
JEREMY
And everything in the universe is
in constant motion, as the universe
is constantly expanding...
SAM
Yeah, but do you believe that
everything happens for a reason,
like in life?
JEREMY
You mean like destiny?
71.
Jeremy thinks on this for a moment.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
I think everyone has a purpose.
Something they're meant to do. Like
potential, but more clear-cut. For
instance, I was destined to get my
hands on the meteorite.
SAM
Really.
JEREMY
I'm making amazing discoveries
every day, practically sleeping at
the lab...
While he talks and becomes more excited he scratches
nervously at his left forearm. It draws Sam's attention away
from what he's saying.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
I'm still doing some tests, but
there's a metallic substance that's
not showing up on the elemental
CHARTS-
SAM
What happened to your arm?
Jeremy stops scratching. A small area on the inner part of
his wrist is RAW and RED, partially SCABBED OVER.
JEREMY
It's just a rash.
Sam starts to get out of the car.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
Sam, wait. Here...
He offers her a wad of cash. Sam hesitates.
SAM
BUT-
JEREMY
I know you need it. It's no big
deal.
She accepts the money.
SAM
Thank you.
72.
Sam stands outside at a payphone, listening to it RING...
Someone on the other end finally picks up:
ROSE DARKO (V.O.)
Hello?
When Sam HEARS her MOTHER'S VOICE, it brings tears to her
eyes. As if feeling her emotion over the phone line, Rose can
be HEARD starting to WHIMPER.
ROSE DARKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Samantha?
EDDIE DARKO (V.O.)
(in the background)
Who is it, Rose?
ROSE DARKO (V.O.)
(CRYING)
Is that you?... if it's you, please
come home.
EDDIE DARKO (V.O.)
Rose?
Although it looks like she wants to, Sam doesn't speak.
74.
Vietnam Tom sits at his new squatting ground, looking out
over all of El Reno. He peers at the twinkling lights through
his scrap metal BUNNY MASK, and cradles his RIFLE in his arms
like a soldier at rest.
He slowly turns and sees that Sam is sitting right next to
him, facing the landscape. She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT,
JEANS and the BANDAGE. The SHARD OF METAL is lodged in her
forehead.
SAM
You wanna know what happens when
you die?
Tom shakes his head no.
SAM (CONT'D)
I wish it was me.
She looks at Tom.
SAM (CONT'D)
I really want... to die.
Tom aims his gun at her face...
He realizes that a FORCE FIELD has formed in between them,
because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier
bends and becomes slightly opaque.
Sam is expressionless. Tom's finger trembles as he places it
on the trigger.
He aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's RIGHT EYE,
and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate
system on the force field. Sam's eye is in the CENTRAL
QUADRANT...
Tom pulls the trigger. TIME SLOWS DOWN.
A liquid VECTOR SPEAR shoots out of the gun barrel.
Immediately after, a BULLET is discharged and follows it...
The VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid, but when
the BULLET reaches it, the entire force field curves to
accommodate the penetrating force...
The spear juts out until it nearly touches Sam's eye... but
then it stops. The bullet catches up and freezes at the same
spot, centimeters from her face --
75.
SAM (CONT'D)
(DISAPPOINTED)
Not today.
I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - DAY
A HAND bangs on the door to room 15...
After a beat, Sam opens it. She's got some makeup on, and has
spent more time on her hair than usual.
SAM
(SURPRISED)
Hi.
Chris lingers in front of the door, looking slightly
uncomfortable.
CHRIS
I just stopped by to see how you
were holdin' up.
SAM
I'm okay.
CHRIS
Sorry about the other night... I
DIDN'T-
SAM
I was just upset. I shouldn't have
snapped at you like that.
Chris nods, grateful for her forgiveness.
CHRIS
So what are you still doin' here? I
figured you woulda hopped on a bus
by now.
SAM
I'm gonna be taking off soon, I
think. I just gotta figure some
stuff out. It's quiet here.
CHRIS
I don't know if you're doin'
anything later on, but...
He trails off when he HEARS a CAR pull up and park by his
truck. He turns and sees that it's Jeremy in his BMW.
76.
SAM
I was just on my way out. What were
you gonna say?
CHRIS
Nothin'.
SAM
Okay, well... I'll see you later?
CHRIS
Yeah, sure.
He steps out of the way so Sam can shut and lock the door.
SAM
Bye.
CHRIS
Bye.
Chris stares down Jeremy as Sam gets into his car and they
drive off together.
The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK carrying the JALOPY breaches the
crest of the hill, descending on the intersection...
Chris lights up a cigarette...
CHRIS' POV - TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK
He watches as the TRACTOR-TRAILER hits the pothole, but
passes safely through the intersection, making a right.
Something about the sight of this strikes Chris so much that
his cigarette falls out of his mouth.
Father Homeijer and Trudy stroll down a quiet street with
their COLLECTIONS JAR, and arrive at a fork in the road.
FATHER HOMEIJER
You take this street, I'll take
that one?
Without warning, Trudy kisses him on the cheek.
TRUDY
Good luck.
Father Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a
friendly manner. They move off in separate directions...
Father Homeijer raps on the door of Dusty's house. No answer.
81.
Dusty's place is surrounded by FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and
an AMBULANCE. Billy Moorcroft is wrapped in a blanket and
being tended to by PARAMEDICS.
Father Homeijer stands near the boy, being interviewed by a
DETECTIVE.
Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a
cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER
HINES (28).
OFFICER O'DELL
Get in there, you sick fuck...
Dusty says nothing as O'Dell shoves him in and slams the
door...
The two officers turn when they see RANDY'S DAD'S CAR pull up
next to the property. Randy is in the driver's seat, looking
confused. Ruth hops out of the passenger seat and darts
toward the house --
-- but she is cut off and grabbed by a POLICEMAN. ANOTHER
OFFICER goes to talk to Randy in the car.
83.
Wheels turning, O'Dell addresses Hines:
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
(regarding Dusty)
Let him rot in there for a few
minutes, maybe till the news guys
show up... I'm gonna go finish
checkin' upstairs.
As Sam's walking away from the motel, she looks up to the sky
at a PASSING JET...
AGATHA (V.O.)
No matter how well you think you
know somebody, you just never
really know...
O'Dell, now dressed in plainclothes, is on the way to his CAR
in the far corner of the back lot. He HEARS someone come out
the door behind him, but doesn't turn until he HEARS his
VOICE.
OFFICER HINES
Hey, O'Dell...
OFFICER O'DELL
I'm on my way out... what do you
need?
88.
Hines catches up with him and they walk and talk.
OFFICER HINES
I'm not gonna bullshit ya.
OFFICER O'DELL
Okay...
OFFICER HINES
I saw you snatch the drugs outta
that house.
O'Dell's face grows cold but he doesn't slow his pace.
OFFICER O'DELL
I don't think I know what the hell
you're talkin' about.
OFFICER HINES
Don't bullshit me either...
Hines grabs his shoulder to stop him. O'Dell eyes his hand.
OFFICER HINES (CONT'D)
I don't wanna turn you in.
OFFICER O'DELL
Then what do you want?
OFFICER HINES
How much you think you'll get when
you unload it?
O'Dell keeps cool, but resents being muscled.
OFFICER O'DELL
Depends.
OFFICER HINES
I'll take forty percent this time,
but from now on it's fifty-fifty.
OFFICER O'DELL
What do you mean from now on?
OFFICER HINES
I got a pretty good idea this ain't
the first time you done this. Won't
be the last, will it?
Hines extends his hand and smiles. O'Dell shakes it.
Grudgingly...
89.
After Hines turns on him and jogs back to the station house,
O'Dell kicks the ground angrily.
OFFICER O'DELL
Shit!
When he looks up, he's startled by a pair of eyes that peer
from the bushes nearby. Upon closer inspection, he sees that
it's Vietnam Tom in his SKI MASK.
Nervous about how much he's heard, O'Dell takes an aggressive
stance.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
Come on outta there. Now!
He becomes tense when Tom emerges, because he sees that he's
got his RIFLE.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
What the fuck you doin' carryin'
that around in the town proper?
O'Dell realizes that he's not holding it in a threatening
manner, but cradling it in his arms.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
Hand it over. Right now!
Tom steps toward him ever so slowly. O'Dell reaches out and
Tom hands him the gun, stock first.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
I should arrest you and throw you
in jail, you know that? Crazy
sonofabitch...
Tom looks at the ground, hunched over meekly.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
Get the fuck outta my sight.
O'Dell looks around as Tom shuffles off, making sure no one
witnessed the transaction.
Sam trudges up the wooded hill to the vantage point, carrying
The Philosophy of Time Travel book. It's quiet and peaceful,
and everything's bathed in golden light.
90.
She comes upon Tom's new squatting ground in a secluded area
near the lookout, and looks around before approaching.
When she sees the handmade BUNNY MASK lying among his things,
she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it
up.
She runs her fingers down the long, shiny ears, nose, and
jagged teeth...
She doesn't realize that Tom is standing close behind her.
When she senses his presence she's startled.
SAM
Sorry...
She sets the BUNNY MASK down where she found it. Tom says
nothing. He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her
there. He walks up beside her and sits, facing the view.
After a long beat, Sam sits down beside him. To her surprise,
Tom begins to speak:
VIETNAM TOM
My mom told me someday everybody
would understand. She said it was
my job to look out for the town...
so that's what I do. That's what I
always do.
Sam listens to him intently.
VIETNAM TOM (CONT'D)
They don't know why. They don't
even want me here, but I still have
to protect them.
SAM
They're lucky to have someone to
protect them.
VIETNAM TOM
I'm used to it... I'm lucky to have
a job to do. Some people don't have
any reason to be here at all.
SAM
I know what you mean...
Tom turns and looks at her strangely.
91.
VIETNAM TOM
You're more important than all of
us.
Sam peers into Tom's pale blue eyes through his ski mask.
Without knowing why, she reaches out and touches the mask...
When she starts to pull it off Tom grabs her hand, stopping
her -- not too rough, but forceful.
Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go. His eyes
drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.
Sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him.
When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with
emotion. Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand.
SAM
Do you like to read?
Tom says nothing.
SAM (CONT'D)
You can borrow it...
Again, Tom does not speak. After a beat, Sam gets up slowly
and walks away, leaving Tom with the book.
Tom wears his metal BUNNY MASK. Sam wears her HOODED
SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, and her right hand is BANDAGED. The
METAL SHARD is embedded under the skin of her forehead...
They move slowly and methodically until they reach the center
of the empty lot. There are lights on in the closed
department store, but the parking lot is mostly dark.
VIETNAM TOM
Why do you talk to me?
TOM'S VOICE is MUFFLED behind his mask.
SAM
Same reason you talk to me...
Tom cocks his head, unsure of the answer.
SAM (CONT'D)
Because I can see how special you
are.
VIETNAM TOM
Why can't other people?
SAM
They will. Only one day left.
They both turn toward an area in the lot where the SHOPPING
CARTS are stored. The METAL STORAGE RACK starts to tremble
and burn with COSMIC ENERGY...
SHOPPING CARTS start to roll out of the RACK by themselves,
following their own liquid VECTOR SPEARS.
Tom stands staring at them. He is flanked by Sam...
Officer Hines walks to the edge of the woods beside the
warehouse and unzips his pants...
ANGLE: O'DELL'S CAR
With GLOVED HANDS, O'Dell grabs VIETNAM TOM'S RIFLE out of
the trunk...
Hines finishes relieving himself and comes out into the open
from the side of the building. O'Dell is waiting for him.
97.
OFFICER HINES
What the fuck-
BOOM!
O'Dell shoots him in the chest. He is cool and calm. He
throws the rifle down on the ground...
The SHOPPING CARTS whirl in an circle of ever-increasing
speed around Vietnam Tom and Sam. The RUBBER WHEELS squeal on
the cement until they start to melt...
The VECTOR SPEARS lead the carts in a spiral that hones in
closer and closer to the two of them. Sam is stoic. Tom is in
awe...
We travel at breath-taking speed through a PORTAL as it
weaves through millions of STARS, then an ATMOSPHERIC
BARRIER...
When it looks like they'll be crushed by the scudding metal,
or combusted by the cosmic energy, the WORM-LIKE PORTAL from
the sky reaches down and encloses Tom and Sam like a vacuum.
There's a brilliant FLASH OF LIGHT -- TRANSITION TO:
CHRIS' TRUCK pulls into the lot early in the morning, and he
gets out wearing his work uniform. Still groggy, he's about
to walk into the store when something catches his eye...
CRANE UP to FIND a STRUCTURE made of all the SHOPPING CARTS,
as chilling and impressive as a crop circle, in the shape of
an immense FIBONACCI SPIRAL. The metal of the carts has been
fused together, and they're stacked in an ascending manner
that reaches an apex in the center, like a cone.
Chris is mystified... CUT TO:
Two POLICE CRUISERS speed down a street in town...
98.
COPS, including Officer O'Dell, converge on Vietnam Tom in
the park, where he sits on the SWING in his ski mask...
COP #1
Get down on the ground!
Tom looks up at them calmly, without fear.
COP #1 (CONT'D)
Get down on the ground, now!
He obeys them and two Cops jump on him and put him in cuffs.
One of them pulls up his head and rips off his ski mask --
Tom's face is a mass of SCARS. Both his cheeks, forehead and
chin are marred by scar tissue born from long, deep gashes.
O'Dell looks into his sad, blue eyes...
Sam walks toward the motel, wearing JEANS and a T-SHIRT...
When she sees JEREMY'S BMW parked in the lot she stops short.
But it's too late -- he's already seen her and is getting out
of the car. He's got a bouquet of FLOWERS.
99.
JEREMY
Hi, Sam...
He passes her the flowers.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
I hope you can forgive the way I
acted.
SAM
That was pretty weird.
JEREMY
I know. I just...
Jeremy is awkward and shy.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
I've been so wrapped up with the
meteorite. I haven't been eating or
sleeping much. I think I'm just
drained... but that's no excuse.
SAM
It's alright.
JEREMY
I was wondering if you'd let me
make it up to you.
SAM
You don't need to-
JEREMY
Please... let me take you to watch
the fireworks tonight.
SAM
I don't think so.
JEREMY
It's gonna be spectacular. There's
gonna be a meteor shower that
coincides with the show... I mean,
how often does that happen?
Sam still isn't sure.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
I just wanna be your friend.
SAM
I was supposed to see `em with
Chris, but... he's stuck at work.
100.
JEREMY
So, what do you say? Will you go
with me?
SAM
Gimme a sec. Lemme grab my
sweatshirt...
Jeremy beams.
Chris is in the department store parking lot with a crew of
EMPLOYEES. They work together to pry apart the numerous
SHOPPING CARTS with CROWBARS. They've made some progress, but
still a long way to go.
Chris is distracted by JEREMY'S BMW as it cruises through the
nearby intersection...
After it passes, Chris looks up at some OMINOUS CLOUDS
congregating in the darkening sky.
From the CLOUDS above the store -- PAN DOWN TO FIND:
The lookout, and Jeremy's car riding up the hill. There are
OTHER CARS parked to watch the upcoming display, but Jeremy
drives to a more SECLUDED AREA... (Music suggestion: 4th of
July, by Soundgarden.)
Jeremy spreads a blanket on the ground of a private grove. He
wears a LIGHT JACKET, and sets down a GROCERY BAG. Sam has
her HOODED SWEATSHIRT tied around her waist.
SAM
Shouldn't we go back out there
where we can see?
JEREMY
No, this'll be perfect. See right
there?
He points to an area near the tops of the trees.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
That's right where the fireworks'll
come up.
(MORE)
101.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
And we can see the meteors better
without all the lights from the
town.
Sam sits down on the blanket and checks her watch. Jeremy
pokes around in the grocery bag.
SAM
So what's in the bag?
JEREMY
You'll see...
Sam takes her HOODED SWEATSHIRT from around her waist and
puts it on to fight the cold...
JEREMY (CONT'D)
There's one!
Sam spots a METEOR as it streaks across the sky --
JEREMY'S HAND holds a flaring ROMAN CANDLE --
JEREMY (O.S.)
Here it goes!
A SPARKLING GREEN BALL shoots out of the stick into the air.
Sam looks up at it and smiles. Jeremy shoots off colorful
ball after ball, aiming in different directions.
SAM
They're pretty.
After his stick fizzles out:
JEREMY
You wanna try one?
Sam shrugs... He grabs another out of the grocery bag, and
Sam gets up slowly. He passes her the ROMAN CANDLE, and she
accepts it with her RIGHT HAND...
JEREMY (CONT'D)
Just hold it straight up.
Sam holds it and Jeremy flicks his LIGHTER. The WICK
catches...
JEREMY (CONT'D)
It's goin'!
102.
Sam smiles and holds the stick as far away from her face as
possible. She closes her eyes...
But the wick burns down extremely fast. The FIRST BALL gets
stuck at the top and implodes, causing the whole thing to
catch fire.
SAM
Ow!
JEREMY
Drop it!
He runs over and stamps it out as quickly as he can...
JEREMY (CONT'D)
Fucking faulty one...
Sam nurses her burned hand.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
Are you okay?
SAM
I think so...
Jeremy inspects her hand -- there's a large BLISTER.
JEREMY
You need to get that covered...
Jeremy takes off his jacket. He then removes his T-shirt and
starts to tear off a piece.
SAM
What are you doing?
JEREMY
It's okay...
The bank sign shows 8:59 PM. The display flashes to: JULY 4,
1995... It changes to the countdown: 00 DAYS, 00 HOURS, 00
MINUTES, 03 SECONDS... 02 SECONDS... 01 SECONDS...
Jeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his T-shirt around
Sam's hand, creating the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
103.
JEREMY
How's it feel?
SAM
A little better...
The FIREWORKS suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the
grove with bursts of bright, multi-colored lights. Sporadic
METEORS rain down at the same time. It's magnificent.
After a beat, Sam looks over at Jeremy...
The fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to
see that the raw, reddish RASH has spread to cover the
greater part of it.
SAM (CONT'D)
Good God...
Jeremy looks down as if he'd forgotten, then quickly picks up
his jacket and puts it back on.
SAM (CONT'D)
(ALARMED)
Is that from the meteorite?
JEREMY
I barely even notice it anymore.
I'm sure it'll go away soon.
He zips up his jacket tight.
SAM
Are you fucking kidding me?
JEREMY
Do you think I'm disgusting?
The question takes Sam by surprise.
SAM
No... I just think you should get
it looked at-
Before Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a
forceful kiss...
Sam shoves him away sharply.
SAM (CONT'D)
What the hell are you doing?
104.
JEREMY
So you do find me disgusting. Which
is it, Sam, I can't take much more
of this shit!
SAM
Jesus Christ...
He tries to grab her, but Sam turns and runs --
JEREMY
Come here!
Sam tears through the woods, Jeremy close behind her. The
FIREWORKS CRACK and POP in the sky above...
JEREMY
Sam! Stop!
Sam jumps over a fallen log in the dark... Jeremy hits it
dead on with his shins and goes head over heels --
JEREMY (CONT'D)
FUCK!
He picks himself up and charges even faster --
Sam sprints by the area of Vietnam Tom's squatting ground.
FIREWORKS continue to EXPLODE and shower overhead, and some
PEOPLE can be HEARD LAUGHING and SHOUTING from the main
parking area, not far away...
Sam runs toward the VOICES --
But Jeremy grabs her from behind and spins her around!
SAM
Why are you doing this?
JEREMY
I just wanna talk to you!
105.
She struggles against his grip. The EXPLOSIONS and the RUCKUS
from CROWD mask their noise.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
Stop it!
Sam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin. He
starts to double over, but recovers quickly and smacks her
across the face --
JEREMY (CONT'D)
Fucking bitch!
Sam is stunned, and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and
shoves her hard --
Sam stumbles backwards and falls, cracking her head on the
metal BUNNY MASK. She rolls over onto her back, REVEALING the
SHARD OF METAL that protrudes from the GASH by her temple...
She struggles no more.
Chris and the other Employees stop working and look up at the
sky, now roiling with sinister, SUPERNATURAL CLOUDS...
Jeremy slowly creeps to where Sam lies... Her eyes are open
and she is completely still.
JEREMY
Sam?...
Jeremy crouches beside her, and when he puts two fingers to
her neck to feel for a pulse, he starts to tremble...
The raining METEORS and FIREWORKS illuminate the SMOKE and
the BLACK CLOUDS overhead...
As Chris approaches Vietnam Tom's squatting ground, the
FIREWORKS DISPLAY is in the midst of the GRANDE FINALE.
Showers of light BURST and CRACKLE in steady succession.
PEOPLE SCREAM in approval from the parking area nearby...
Chris comes upon Sam's lifeless form.
CHRIS
No...
He stoops by her, picks her up and hugs her limp body
close...
As he does this, Vietnam Tom approaches from behind him.
Chris turns to face him but says nothing, still holding Sam.
The WIND picks up and blows in gusts around them...
Tom looks down at the two of them for a moment, then reaches
down and picks up his BUNNY MASK. The EVIL GRIN is red with
SAM'S BLOOD, and one of the teeth is missing...
107.
The last of the fireworks display occurs, leaving the night
full of SMOKE, HELLISH CLOUDS and an increasing number of
bright-tailed METEORS -- the APOCALYPSE.
Amongst the churning clouds, a tornado-like PORTAL cuts
through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town. It's
swirling and vast, stretching down from limitless space...
SAM (V.O.)
15 days... 18 hours...
Tom puts on the BUNNY MASK...
SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
VIETNAM TOM
45 minutes... 6 seconds...
45 minutes... 6 seconds...
And focuses on a single METEOR that plummets toward the
yawning VORTEX, using telekinetic power to guide it...
The METEOR blazes through the WORMHOLE --
KEY SCENES IN REVERSE
THE BARS TO THE JAIL CELL STRAIGHTEN --
THE WORDS `THOMAS WARD SPARROW' ARE LIFTED FROM THE BOOKING
SLIP --
SHOPPING CARTS SWIRL IN A DECONSTRUCTING SPIRAL --
O'DELL GIVES TOM BACK HIS RIFLE --
FATHER HOMEIJER PLACES BILLY MOORCROFT BACK IN HIS CAGE --
SAM PICKS UP THE PAYPHONE --
THE CHURCH REBUILDS ITSELF OUT OF FLAMES --
THE THREE CROSSES IN IMITATION OF CALVARY RIGHT THEMSELVES --
SAM'S FACE DIPS BENEATH THE SURFACE OF RANDY'S POOL --
TRANSITION TO:
The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to --
JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown
to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29
MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...
108.
Vietnam Tom sits atop the platform, more than 30 feet up,
wearing his ski mask and holding his rifle. The surface of
the platform is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER
BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP.
Relaxed and at peace, Tom looks up to the clear night sky. As
a TREMOR starts to build, he takes off his ski mask and gazes
out over his town...
He smiles.
Suddenly, there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT --
deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- CUT TO:
CHARACTER MONTAGE
Dusty sits and stares at his CELLAR DOOR... Trudy holds a
PICTURE OF FATHER HOMEIJER and cries... Ruth snorts some COKE
in her room... Jeremy scratches his LEFT FOREARM in his
sleep... Billy Moorcroft shivers from the chill in his
CAGE... Officer O'Dell sits alone in his patrol car,
fingering the trigger of his PISTOL... TRANSITION TO:
Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER
about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits
of wood and metal strewn everywhere. Ground water spurts from
the broken well seal.
A cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
crater...
Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite as Sam and O'Dell arrive
on the scene. There are PARAMEDICS, a CORONER and other
POLICEMEN there as well, and a large area has been cordoned
off with POLICE TAPE.
109.
Corey is there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, Phil
Coulter, and other local CITIZENS. TOM'S REMAINS are carried
off in a BLACK BAG...
SAM
Oh my God...
Sam moves to stand by Corey. The overall mood is grim, and
Frank stands peering at the wreckage with a long face.
FRANK
I don't believe it...
The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.
FRANK (CONT'D)
This is just a tragedy.
Officer O'Dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite
with his boot.
OFFICER O'DELL
Sell that thing off to some
meteorologist nerd club, I bet you
could do okay.
FRANK
Do I look like the type of guy
that's gonna try and profit off
another man's death? You should be
ashamed of yourself.
OFFICER O'DELL
(EMBARRASSED)
I was just sayin'...
Sam looks down on the ground and sees Tom's multi-colored SKI
MASK...
She picks it up.
COREY
What are you doing?
As she caresses the fibers with her fingers, she is filled
with unwarranted emotion...
Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when
they turn and see that Chris has followed them.
110.
CHRIS
Hey...
SAM
Hey.
CHRIS
So you guys stayed here last night?
COREY
One of us did.
Sam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment.
CHRIS
What's up with your car?
COREY
It's gonna take a couple days.
CHRIS
For a water pump?
Sam and Corey shrug.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
It's none of my business, but...
He's distracted when JEREMY'S BMW pulls up and parks. He hops
out and hustles across the field toward the crash site...
SAM
What?
Chris regains his train of thought:
CHRIS
I was just gonna say, if you
wanted, I could give you a ride
back.
He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over
at Corey, as if just remembering that she were there.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
You too. I mean, I could give you
both a ride.
COREY
To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you-
SAM
(INTERRUPTING)
I'll go.
111.
COREY
(PISSED)
What?
SAM
I think I wanna go.
COREY
Things get a little tough, you're
just gonna give up?
SAM
It's not like that... You should
come too.
COREY
Fuck that. I'll wait for my car and
stick to the plan. Do whatever the
fuck you want.
Corey turns and goes inside the room.
SAM
Corey...
Sam looks back to Chris, who is uncomfortable for causing the
conflict.
CHRIS
Sorry to screw you guys up.
SAM
It's alright. She can take care of
herself... she's good at it. I've
gotta go home.
