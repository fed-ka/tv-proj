          drawn to a MAN signing some autographs as a newspaper
            PHOTOGRAPHER snaps pictures and TWO REPORTERS take notes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who's that?

                                        BRUCE
                        Danny Avila, boxer who's fighting
                        Darryl Tibbs up here on Friday.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tibbs?  Isn't he the...?

                        Yeah, it's a regular Rocky story. 
                        This fight is his big shot.

          Avila sees Bruce and waves.  Bruce waves back and Avila
          starts toward them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know him?

                                        BRUCE
                          I helped Danny rehab his knee a
                        while back.  Nice guy.


          ANGLE ON DANNY AVILA

          He's a trim middle-weight in his late 30s.  He's trailed
          by his three-months-pregnant wife HELENA, 30, as well as
          the photographer and reporters.

                                        AVILA
                        Hey, man, long time, no see.

                                        BRUCE
                        In my business, that's a good
                        thing.
                                (they bump fists)

                                        AVILA
                        Honey, you remember Bruce Lewis...

                                        HELENA
                                (smiling)
                        Of course.

                                        AVILA*
                        Hey man, guess what, I'm going to*
                        be a dad...*

                                        BRUCE
                          Congratulations!*
                                (then to Helena)*
                          I thought you had a glow about*
                        you.  Danny, Helena, this is my*
                        friend, Johnny Smith.

          Johnny hangs back slightly, and has picked up one of
          Bruce's bags, avoiding a handshake.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nice to meet you.

          One of the reporters notices Johnny and Avila together,
          and whispers to his photographer who lifts the camera --

                        Hey Johnny, how 'bout a picture
                        with the contender?

          Johnny tries to back out, but the Reporter is already
          nudging Avila next to him, squeezing Bruce and Helena
          aside.

                        C'mon, a coupla local heroes...
                        just take a sec...

          Avila shrugs, it's okay with him, and Johnny shoots Bruce
          a look, but he's trapped; it'd be rude not to oblige. 
          Avila steps beside him and Johnny smiles gamely as the
            photographer snaps a couple of shots.  Then:

                                        AVILA
                        Hey wait, get one like this.

          He playfully pretends to punch Johnny in the jaw.  Only
          on the light contact, we RAMP TO JOHNNY'S JAW and...





          Several TV NEWS TRUCKS parked in front, their antennaes
          up.  We hear Jimmy D prelapped...

                                        JIMMY D (V.O.)
                        As you all know, Ali-Liston II
                        was the last big fight to be held
                        in Lewiston, so I was proud to
                        bring boxing back to Maine.



          Bruce and Johnny approach a bench in some T.B.D. scenic
          locale.

                                        BRUCE
                        You sure this is the spot?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're early.

                                        BRUCE
                        Next question:  Why are we here?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because it occurred to me -- while
                        Danny Avila was pinning my head against
                        my stairwell -- that maybe we're going
                        about this the wrong way.  If we can't
                        stop the fight, maybe we can arrange
                          a different ending.

          Bruce senses where he's going.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're thinking of trying to use
                        your abilities to help him win?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd settle for helping him
                          survive.  But I can't help him if
                        I can't get near him.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                                (beat)
                        He won't talk to me anymore and
                        his trainer's already thrown us
                        out of his gym.  Which is why we
                        need somebody who can talk to
                        him, somebody he trusts.

          And he turns as we see Helena Avila walking toward them,
          carrying a store-bought lunch, wearing a wary expression.



          Tracking in front of Johnny, Bruce and Helena as they
          walk along, Johnny finishing up his story, Helena pensive,
            fingering A SMALL CRUCIFIX PENDANT.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know it must be hard to
                        believe... hard for anyone to
                        believe...

                                        HELENA
                        No, it's not.
                                (eyeing Johnny)
                        I think things happen to people
                        for a reason.  Things like your
                          accident.  Like your meeting Danny.
                                (beat, forthright)
                        To me you are an angel, Mister
                        Smith, sent to protect my husband.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think he'd probably disagree
                        with you.

                                        HELENA
                        You have to understand boxers. 
                        They think if they admit their
                        fear, they're finished.  But I
                        know my husband, and he is afraid.

                                        BRUCE
                        Anyone would be afraid of dying.

                                        HELENA
                        Maybe it's that, or maybe it's
                          something that scares him just as
                        much.  Failure... the end of his
                        hopes and dreams... I don't know. 
                        What I do know is he'll never
                        quit.

          As we pull up, revealing Avila lying dead on the canvas,
          Vic and the Doctor beside him.  And now Johnny's there
          too, wearing an Avila team jacket, no longer an observer
          but part of this grim scene.

          Then we continue pulling up until their figures become
          tiny and insignificant, framed in the slowly rotating
          square of the ring.  THE VISION ENDS.

          still holding Avila's hand and forcing a smile, never
