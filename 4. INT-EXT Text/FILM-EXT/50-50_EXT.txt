It's another picture perfect day in San Diego. The beaches,
golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of
rapturous citizens.
A BUS pulls up and unloads it's passengers.
We follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25), a kind faced, mild mannered,
pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old
man. He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches
MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL.
Through the window of the hospital the CAMERA PULLS OUT and
PANS across the San Diego skyline. We watch as the Sun sets
to night, then rises to morning...
SUPER: JUNE
It's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to
lift. With no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard
is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then
rolling back out to the Pacific Ocean.
About a mile inland, we come upon:
Rows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with
lawns groomed to perfection fill the community. This is
Southern California Suburbia.
The sound of the waves crashing gets increasingly louder and
louder as we PUSH IN ON:
SETH (25), pulls up in front of Adam's house in his white
Neon and HONKS the horn. On the bumper is a sticker: "Let's
put the Christ back in Christmas."
Overweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence,
Seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit.
Just then Seth looks over at 3 YOUNG SCHOOL CHILDREN and
their MOTHER waiting for the school bus. The mother's jaw is
on the ground in shock. Seth hides the joint and smiles in
embarrassment.
SETH
Hi kids. Beautiful day isn't it?
The mother quickly moves her kids out of sight.
Adam approaches Seth's car. He spots his neighbors ANDREW and
MISSY DONNELLY (late 40's) getting into their car. They wave
to Adam.
8.
ANDREW
Hey Adam.
ADAM
(SEEMS ANNOYED)
Hey Andrew.
ANDREW
Sorry about the noise last night.
Adam shrugs as if to say "what the fuck?" Andrew and Missy
giggle as they get into their car.
Adam enters the hospital...
The bus stops. Adam gets off, walks to his house, and takes a
deep breath...
Rachel pulls her car up to the front of the hospital. Adam
kisses her goodbye and gets out of the car. He takes a few
steps and then turns back. He gives her a nervous smile and
then continues into the hospital.
The sun sets over the San Diego skyline.
Adam stands on the sidewalk impatiently waiting for the dog
to do his business.
ADAM
(to the dog)
Come on. Today...If I don't get
laid tonight because of you, I'm
going to take your little bow and
make a noose...
The dog sniffs around, trying to find the perfect spot.
ADAM (CONT'D)
(PLEADING)
Please! I need this.
ADAM'S NEIGHBOR walks by with A GIANT MASTIFF. He sees Adam
yelling at the little Shi Tzu in ribbons. Adam looks up...
ADAM (CONT'D)
(EMBARRASSED)
Evening.
NEIGHBOR
Nice dog.
Once the neighbor is out of sight-
ADAM
Will you please just finish.
The dog finally finishes. Adam runs back into the house.
After a minute, he realizes he left the dog in the street. He
runs back after the dog, scoops him up and then runs back
inside.
48.
Edith's car whizzes down the street and peels into the Beth
Israel Synagogue parking lot. The car comes to an abrupt stop
as it parks in the last empty space.
Edith and Adam step out of the car and walk 20 feet before
they realize Art is still in the car.
EDITH
Art come on.
ART
I'm coming.
Art, still in the car, doesn't move. Edith looks at her watch
and walks back to the car.
EDITH
We're late.
Edith grabs Art's hand. He slowly gets out of the car.
Adam is standing on line for a Roller Coaster. He gets to the
front of the line when the CARNIE stops him.
CARNIE
Hey you! What do you think you're
doing?
Everything Adam says is in German and subtitled in English.
ADAM
I want to ride.
CARNIE
Read the sign.
The Carnies points to a sign that reads "No Cancer."
ADAM
I don't have cancer.
CARNIE
Then what's that?
The Carnie points out Adam's T-shirt, it reads "I'M WITH
CANCER."
58.
Adam turns around to see a GIANT BALD FAT MAN eating cotton
candy, his shirt reads "CANCER".
Adam tries to run away, but he's attached to the Giant Fat
Bald Guy via an umbilical cord. The Giant Fat Bald Guy
reaches out, picks Adam up, and swallows him.
END DREAM SEQUENCE
Adam looks worn and exhausted from the chemo. He's never felt
worse.
KATIE
So how do you feel after your first
treatment?
ADAM
I feel like I was just gang raped
by the Buena Vista Social Club.
KATIE
Is everything with you going to be
a joke?
ADAM
I'm serious. Have you heard their
horn section?
KATIE
Adam, you have a responsibility to
your mind and body.
ADAM
I was just injected with three
pints of kryptonite. Can we please
hold off on the new agey stuff.
KATIE
You can't just sit there and ignore
what's happening to you...You need
to stop bottling everything up.
59.
ADAM
What I need is for people to stop
telling me what I need.
KATIE
Have you considered that this
cancer is nature's way of telling
you to change the way you live your
life?
(off Adam's look)
...There's an old saying - you
can't change the wind, but you can
adjust the sails.
ADAM
They teach you that in medical
school?
Katie's patience is waning.
KATIE
I know you don't like to talk about
your feelings, but you have to
learn to find an outlet.
ADAM
(FRUSTRATED)
An outlet for what? I have cancer.
KATIE
And how is your body ever going to
fight the stress of that cancer if
you can't even handle your own
emotions?
Adam snaps, rasing his voice.
ADAM
Well excuse me. You'll have to
forgive me for not having a firm
handle on my emotions at this
particular juncture of my life.
Katie's a little shaken by Adam's outburst. She stays firm.
KATIE
You don't have to be here.
Adam knows he went too far. Plus, that little outburst lifted
a little wight off his shoulders, and he knows it.
ADAM
I'm sorry, I know you're only
trying to help.
(MORE)
60.
ADAM (CONT'D)
This is all too much for me. I
don't know what to do. Just tell me
what to do and I'll do it.
Katie looks at Adam, is he being for real? She's skeptical.
KATIE
I want you to do some homework.
Here's a list of books on mind-body
therapy. They should help you get
started.
Katie hands Adam a sheet of paper with a list of books
scribbled on it.
WE PUSH IN ON THE LIST OF BOOKS:
Adam's on his cell phone pacing in front of the hospital.
RACHEL (V.O.)
Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing
something really important. I'll
give you a call when I'm
done...yay!
ADAM
(INTO PHONE)
Hey it's me, just checking to see
if you're on your way.
CUT TO:
Adam paces impatiently. He calls Rachel again, it goes
straight to voice mail.
71.
RACHEL (V.O.)
Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing
something really important. I'll
give you a call when I'm
done...yay!
ADAM
(INTO PHONE)
It's me again. Just checking to see
where you are. In case you're
looking for me I'm now on the other
side of the parking lot. Call me.
As Katie walks to her car, she sees Adam pacing and mumbling
to himself.
KATIE
Adam?
ADAM
(EMBARRASSED)
Oh hey.
KATIE
What are you doing?
ADAM
Just waiting for Rachel to pick me
up.
KATIE
What time is she coming?
ADAM
Uh, four.
Katie looks at her watch.
KATIE
It's six thirty.
ADAM
She must be stuck in traffic.
KATIE
You want a ride?
Adam and Katie arrive at Adam's house.
ADAM
Thanks for the ride...
Adam looks at his house. The lights are out. He's really not
in the mood to be alone. He looks back at Katie.
ADAM (CONT'D)
Do you want to come in. For a
beverage? Or something?
KATIE
It probably wouldn't be very
professional of me.
ADAM
Come on, I'll let you analyze my
Id.
Katie is hesitant, but she also feels in a strange way that
Adam is more than a patient.
KATIE
Uh, okay. But I can't stay long.
Adam and Mitch stand next to the RABBI.
The tombstone reads "ALAN LIEBOWITZ (1923-2007) FINALLY."
THE CAMERA TILTS up to the sky, and then DOWN to reveal:
A healthy Adam is surrounded by dozens of energetic elderly
people who are swimming, playing bocci ball, shuffle board,
bridge, etc. Adam looks on in confusion as an OLD MAN wearing
an official looking badge drives by on a golf cart.
ADAM
Excuse me.
The old man stops his cart.
OLD MAN
How can I help you?
ADAM
Where am I?
OLD MAN
The After Life.
ADAM
This is Heaven?
The old man scratches his balls.
OLD MAN
Pretty great huh? They've even got
a frozen yogurt machine.
The old man points to a long line of excited seniors awaiting
their turn at a massive Frozen Yogurt Sundae Bar. A sign in
front reads "WAIT: 45 MINUTES".
ADAM
There are lines in Heaven?
OLD MAN
It's worth it.
End Dream.
82.
Adam walks along the boardwalk. He's surrounded by
perfection. The beach. The water. The blue sky. Hundreds of
beautiful men and women in their 20's and 30's: jogging,
biking, surfing, skate boarding, playing volleyball, etc. He
looks like a raisin among grapes.
Adam stands impatiently on his porch. He looks at his watch
and then dials his phone.
RACHEL (V.O.)
Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing
something really important. I'll
give you a call when I'm
done...yay!
Adam's face is red with fury. He does his best to hold back.
ADAM
(SWEET)
Hey, it's Adam. Where are you?
Maybe you forgot, but my
appointment is today. So call me
back.
Enraged, Adam hangs up.
ADAM (CONT'D)
Fuck!
Adam picks up his phone and dials again.
SETH (V.O.)
Yoooooo.
ADAM
Hey man, I need you to do me -
SETH (V.O.)
Not around. Leave a message.
Adam hangs up and dials again.
91.
EDITH (O.S.)
(YELLING)
Hello,
Adam holds the phone away from his ear and cringes. A pang of
regret runs through his body.
ADAM
Hi mom.
Adam and Seth sit on the bow of a docked sail boat. The two
have had a lot to drink. Adam is understandably upset.
SETH
Your skin is the canvas upon which
my dreams are painted?
ADAM
(DISGUSTED)
I know.
SETH
(BEAT)
Is "dreams" a metaphor, for-
Seth makes a masturbating motion with his hand.
ADAM
You remember the last time we came
out here?
SETH
Prom night. How could I forget? Jen
Zabrowski went down on me right
where you're sitting.
ADAM
That memory is so far from me,
SETH
Jen giving me a blow job?
ADAM
No, prom night. It feels like a
lifetime ago... I know it happened,
but that's it. It's like someone
else's memory.
Adam stares out at the ocean. Reality check.
SETH
You okay?
Adam throws his beer bottle into the ocean.
ADAM
I can't believe this is all
actually happening.
SETH
The girl or the cancer?
102.
ADAM
Both.
SETH
It's some pretty fucked up shit.
ADAM
You know, I used to think that I
was actually going to spend the
rest of my life with
Rachel...granted that might not be
so far off.
(shakes his head)
What a waste.
Seth puts his arm around him.
SETH
We need to get you laid.
ADAM
(ANNOYED)
Don't you ever give up?
SETH
No.
ADAM
Seriously, who's going to have sex
with me?
SETH
Some girls are into it?
ADAM
I look like Powder.
(BEAT)
Plus I have erectile
dysfunction...temporary. I hope.
SETH
Then let's go get me laid.
Seth stands, and then stumbles. He's really drunk.
ADAM
I think I should drive.
SETH
You don't have a license.
ADAM
You're drunk.
103.
SETH
Do you even know how to drive?
ADAM
How hard can it be?
SETH
Hard enough that you don't have a
license.
ADAM
(SOMBER)
This might be my last chance.
SETH
Driving! You care about driving! We
could be on Everest getting high on
Ayahuasca with Sherpas, and you
want to drive!...Forget it, I give
up. Drive.
The two get off the boat and climb into Seth's car.
Adam puts the key in the ignition. Without checking the
mirrors, he backs the car up. BOOM the car slams into a giant
statue of Neptune riding a sea horse.
SETH (CONT'D)
Hey Miss Daisy, will you please
watch where your going?
ADAM
What? I didn't see it.
SETH
That's what the mirrors are for.
Adam pulls out of the parking lot.
SETH (CONT'D)
Turn right.
ADAM
I know what I'm doing.
Adam turns left onto a one way street. It's the wrong way.
SETH
Apparently not. YOU'RE GOING THE
WRONG WAY!
An oncoming car honks and swerves out of the way - only
nearly avoiding a head on collision.
104.
SETH (CONT'D)
Adam! Turn the car around.
ADAM
No. I'm driving and I want to go
this way.
Another car swerves out of the way.
SETH
What the fuck is wrong with you?
ADAM
For once can you just shut up and
let me do this? So I'm driving the
wrong way? Big fucking deal.
Seth pulls the emergency brake. The car stops abruptly.
SETH
You're an idiot.
A beat.
ADAM
Get out.
SETH
This is my car.
Adam looks like he's about to erupt.
ADAM
GET! OUT!
Seth looks at Adam speechless, and then gets out of the car.
SETH
You're being a real douche.
Adam locks the doors and sits quietly for a moment. He then
proceeds scream at the top of his lungs. 25 years worth of
suppressed emotions come out.
Adam pulls out his cell phone. Seth notices. He tries to open
the door. It's locked.
SETH (CONT'D)
Adam, open the door.
Adam ignores Seth and begins to dial.
105.
SETH (CONT'D)
Don't you dare call her. Not after
everything she's done to you.
Adam gives Seth the finger.
SETH (CONT'D)
You're a pussy.
ADAM
Well you're a selfish piece of shit
who cares more about getting his
dick wet than actually being a
friend.
Seth looks hurt. Adam holds the phone up to his head.
Seth and Adam stagger into the building.
Seth's car enters the Mall parking lot and parks.
VOICE MALL OPERATOR (V.O.)
You have 2 new messages. First
message.
A beep.
RICHARD MATHESSON (V.O.)
Hi Adam, this is Richard Mathesson,
your family's estate lawyer. Your
mother asked me to call. We need to
talk about potential, ah, well just
call me, there are some potential
arrangements we need to work out.
Seth's car drives up the long driveway of the Cemetery.
109.
VOICE MAIL OPERATOR (V.O.)
Next message.
A beep.
DR. ROSS (V.O.)
Adam, this is Dr. Ross. Good news,
I was able to expedite the wait for
your surgery. Your scheduled for
tomorrow morning at 7:00 am with
Dr. Lamb. Please call my office if
you have any questions.
A MORTICIAN, stout and dignified, with a slight British
accent leads Adam and Seth on a tour of the cemetery grounds.
MORTICIAN
Here at Linden we're more than just
a stopping ground for the deceased.
We understand that life is
different for everyone, and helping
families to see their loved ones
off to the hereafter means
approaching every funeral and
burial with it's own dignity and
care...A funeral is a representation
of the individuals time spent on
earth, so I ask you to reflect on
your inevitable interment and think
carefully in choosing the service
and tomb that best befits you.
SETH
What about a Viking funeral?
MORTICIAN
(INTRIGUED)
I'm not familiar.
SETH
(talking out of his ass)
You know, we put him on a boat...
cover it with...dirt
and...branches...whatever you can
find. We push it out...into the
sea...or the ocean...and then shoot
flaming arrows, boom! It catches on
fire...And that's it. It's awesome.
The Mortician stops and looks at Seth. He's not even going to
dignify Seth with a reply. A beat.
110.
MORTICIAN
(points to grave plot)
Here you are, the Schwartz family
plot.
Adam and Seth look at the rows of Schwartz family tombstones.
Up front is an empty gap, presumably where Adam and his
parents are to go. Adam and Seth stare at the graves as we:
DISSOLVE TO:
SUPER: NOVEMBER
A door bell. A hand reaches out. A finger on that hand pushes
the door bell. The other hand holds a bouquet of flowers.
The hand belongs to Mitch's wife, MARGARET (80). She stands
on the porch of a small beach bungalow.
The front door opens. Margaret looks straight ahead. Nothing.
She then looks down, startled by Adam in a wheelchair.
MARGARET
(STARTLED)
Oh, hello, I didn't see you, ah
down there.
There's a glow in Adam's face - he looks younger and more
jovial than we've ever seen.
117.
ADAM
You must be Margaret.
MARGARET
Yes, I'm looking for Adam Schwartz.
ADAM
That's me.
MARGARET
(face lights up)
You're Adam? The way Mitch
described you, I always assumed you
to be much older. About 50 years
older. But, you're just a baby...
Adam blushes.
ADAM
I'm so glad you could make it.
(SOLEMN)
I'm really sorry about Mitch.
MARGARET
Me too.
ADAM
Please come inside. You're just in
time.
Adam leads Margaret inside, past a dozen oversized boxes.
ADAM (CONT'D)
Sorry about the mess. I just moved
in...The ocean air is supposed to
be good for my recovery.
