        JOHN TELLER, 25, tall, strong, long hair, climbs on a 
          HARLEY.  Strapped to the bike is a bedroll, backpack, 
        life stuff.  He gives an uncomfortable nod to the camera.  
        FIRES up the bike.  As he rides away we see the back of 
        his sleeveless leather jacket, BLUE letters on a WHITE 
          background -- upper rocker reads: SONS OF ANARCHY, lower 
        rocker reads: REDWOOD.  In the center, the logo:  
          ANARCHIST SKULL, with two M-16 CROSSBONES.  

        CLAY MORROW, 21, PINEY WINSTON, 32, six other BIKERS, 
        same hippy-vibe, same jacket, follow in line.  A few of 
        them, CLEARLY STONED.  The original nine.  They disappear 
        down the highway.  The history begins --



        John Teller, 34, sits at a picnic table.  A huge BBQ goes 
        on around him.  Music, dancing, Harleys.  Cuddling up 
        next to John is GEMMA, 18, very PREGNANT.  The camera 
        pulls back to reveal over 50 BIKERS.  These guys are not 
          hippies.  They have a harder, outlaw vibe.  They all wear 
        their colors.  The upper rockers read: SONS OF ANARCHY.  
        Now, the lower rockers reveal other charters in addition 
        to Redwood: CHINO, SONOMA, PHOENIX.  A prominent  MC  now 
        sits next to the skull.



          Outside a REMOTE CABIN, an unseen law officer documents 
        the crime scene.  We see dozens of CHPS and SAN JOAQUIN 
        COUNTY SHERIFFS standing over a cache of GUNS, DRUGS, 
        CASH.  Next to the evidence, 11 SONS OF ANARCHY, from 
          different charters, lie face down in the dirt, handcuffed.  
        John Teller, 40, among them.  On the back of John s 
          colors, next to REDWOOD, is a patch that reads: ORIGINAL.  



          Through the windshield of the cruiser we see a jack-
        knifed SEMI on the side of the road.  A long skid mark, 
        black and red, stretches across east and westbound lanes.  
        At the end of it, a mangled HARLEY.  An ambulance slowly 
        pulls away.  



        The Teller family plot.  We see an ornate mahogany casket 
        raised above a freshly dug grave.  Not yet in the hole.  
        At the grave site next to the hole is a HEADSTONE, 
          adorned with a ceramic ETCHED PHOTO of an eight-year-old 
        Tommy.  It reads: IN LOVING MEMORY OF OUR LITTLE BOY.  
        THOMAS WAYNE TELLER.  BORN APRIL 8th, 1980.  DIED APRIL 
        4th, 1988.  

        The camera WHIPS around to reveal a veiled Gemma, 34, 
          fighting back tears.  At her side, Jax, 15.  They are 
          surrounded by hundreds of MEN wearing SAMC colors.  A 
        huge funeral.  The narrow street is lined with HARLEYS.  

        There are STICKERS on the side of the casket.  One reads: 
        SONS OF ANARCHY MOTORCYCLE CLUB REDWOOD ORIGINAL.  The 
        other reads: LIVE SONS OF ANARCHY, DIE SONS OF ANARCHY.

        Gemma holds John Teller s leather vest, his SAMCRO 
          colors.  She kisses the vest and drapes it over the 
          coffin.  

        The Camera PUSHES TIGHT on John Teller s colors, his 
          PRESIDENT s patch fills the screen.  Then --

        The President s patch MORPHS into a VICE PRESIDENT S 
        PATCH.  The camera pulls out to reveal the patch is on 
        the jacket of --



        Jax Teller, 33.  On a Harley.  In formation behind him, 
        five other SAMCRO MEMBERS.  

        They pass a sun-beaten wooden road sign that reads: 
          WELCOME TO CHARMING.  OUR NAME SAYS IT ALL.

        The young buck leads his troops.  They disappear down the 
          highway.  The history continues --

                                                                      SMASH TO BLACK.




                                            2THE MOTORCYCLE CLUB
Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original (SAMCRO)

Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club was founded in 1968 by John Teller and 
Piney Winston.  Ex-Paratroopers who returned from Vietnam feeling 
displaced, unwanted and unappreciated.  Heroes who never got a parade.  
The original charter was simply called "Redwood", because they had no 
home.  Nine men, six of them vets, began their rebellious quest for 
freedom and individuality on the open roads of Northern Cali.

THE WORLD

Charming, California.  Rural, primarily middle-class.  Redwood 
country.  Big Lumber.  Oakland, San Jose fifty miles in either 
direction.  Most members live in a quaint, suburban area they call Sam 
Crow's Corner.  It s idyllic, incestuous and oddly Americana.  

THE COLORS

The uniform of Sam Crow.  A sleeveless leather or denim jacket.  On the 
back, BLUE letters on a WHITE background, the upper rocker reads: SONS 
OF ANARCHY, lower rocker reads: REDWOOD.  In the center, the logo:  An 
angry SKULL, with an anarchist s  A  in the middle of its forehead.  
Two M-16s as its CROSSBONES.  Next to the skull, a prominent MC.  Below 
Redwood, a blue patch that reads: ORIGINAL.  Other patches and pins of 
merit are proudly displayed.  Signifying their renegade status among 
motorcyclists.  Colors are only worn by club members, it's an outlaw's 
identity.  They are sacred.

THE MOTORCYCLES

Harleys.  Dynas and Road Kings.  No imports, choppers or softails.

THE CLUBHOUSE

Homebase for the Sons of Anarchy.  The doors are thick and heavy.  
Bulletproof.  The windows, tinted and barred.  SECURITY CAMERAS watch 
every entrance and exit.  It's half fortress, half adult arcade.  

In the main room, a long redwood CONFERENCE TABLE fills half the 
space.  Leather chairs all around; some labeled: PRESIDENT, VICE 
PRESIDENT, TREASURER, etc.  Against the wall, a fully-stocked BAR.  In 
clear view, a bank of SECURITY MONITORS.  

In the back room, a piano on a small STAGE.  To the left, a full 
KITCHEN, to the right, a one-room APARTMENT.  Upstairs, pool tables, 
pinball machines, X-box and a WEIGHT ROOM.  

On the walls, hundreds of PHOTOS of Sons of Anarchy members.  The 
history of the club.  We also see PAINTINGS and other gifts of ART, 
interpreting the Sons of Anarchy logo and colors.  

One wall is filled with MUGSHOTS of club members.  



                                            3And there are plaques with slogans everywhere: 

- YOU DON'T RIDE, YOU DON'T VOTE.
- NO JUNKIES ALLOWED.
- TREAT ME GOOD, I TREAT YOU BETTER.  TREAT ME BAD, I TREAT YOU WORSE.   
- DON'T LET YOUR OLD LADY FIND OUT ABOUT YOUR MAMA.
- A CHILD IS "BORN" INTO A FAMILY.  A MAN "EARNS" HIS.
- LIVE SONS OF ANARCHY, DIE SONS OF ANARCHY.

                                            TEASER

      SMASH UP ON:



      A YOUNG BUCK drinks from a tame brook.  A near-full moon.  
      Lush.  Peaceful.  We soak in the tranquility.  Then -- 

    We hear a huge EXPLOSION.  In the distance, see a FLASH of 
      ORANGE LIGHT.  Fireworks.  The buck BOLTS.  Moments later, 
      debris rains down from above.  Cinder, ash, tin and a POLYMER 
    GUN STOCK.  The stock, still on fire, burns like a broken 
      torch.  We PUSH TIGHT on the RED FLAME as it MORPHS into --  

      A BLUE FLAME.  Hear THE WHITE STRIPES.  PULL BACK to reveal, 
    the flame is a BLOW TORCH and we are inside --



    The bearer of the torch, JAX TELLER, 33.  Handsome, in a 
      broken cowboy kind of way.  He wears a cut-off gray work 
      shirt,  Jax  on one pocket, TELLER-MORROW on the other.  On 
    his arms, lots of ink and scars.  Goggles on, music blaring 
      from a BOOMBOX, he works the BLOW TORCH on the frame of a 
      MOTORCYCLE.  Shaping the steel.  Bending it to his will.  

    In the bay next to him, TICK WHALEN, 56.  Mechanic.  His arms 
      too, covered in scars and ink.  A CROSS around his neck.



    The CAMERA DISCOVERS Teller-Morrow, a full service automotive 
      facility.  An OFFICE, four-bay GARAGE.  Mechanical, autobody, 
      custom Harley work.  Lot is nearly full.  Business ain t bad.  

    On the same lot there s a two-story, nondescript, brick 
      building.  The Sons of Anarchy MC, Redwood CLUBHOUSE.  All 
    the property is surrounded by stay-the-fuck-out barbed-wire.

      A TOW TRUCK pulls in with a white LEXUS.  A DEER ASS sticks 
    out of the shattered windshield of the sedan.  The front half 
      lies across the seat.  It s the young buck from the forest. 

    Out of the tow truck hops DUBLIN LOWE, 35, and HALF-SACK 
      EPPS, 23.  Both wear grey mechanic shirts with the T-M logo.  
      Over the work shirt, their SAMCRO colors.  Half-Sack only has 
      a bottom rocker: REDWOOD.  He hasn t earned the rest.

                                          DUBLIN
                      Ask Jax what we should do with Bambi.

      Half-Sack sees Jax is focused on the bike.  Hesitates, then 
      heads over to his open bay.  Jax s back is to him --


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                          (shouts)
                      Hey, Jax!  Yo, dude.  

      Between the automotive din, the music and the blow torch, Jax 
      can t hear anyone.  Half-Sack looks to Dublin for direction --

                                          DUBLIN
                      What re you, retarded?  Just tap him.

      Tick, Dublin share a look.  Tick shakes his head.  Bad idea.  
      Half-Sack reaches into Jax s bay and TAPS his shoulder.  Jax 
      JUMPS out of his skin.  With his free hand, he instinctively 
      SLAMS Half-Sack against a pillar.  Tick TURNS DOWN the music.

                                        JAX
                      Hell s a matter with you?

      Half-Sack, clearly spooked, tries to stay hard.  Jax sees 
      Dublin LAUGHING, WHIPS a wrench at him.  To Half-Sack --

                                        JAX
                      Don t listen to everything your 
                      sponsor tells you, prospect.  Some 
                      shit ll get you killed.

      Biker philosophy 101 --

                                          DUBLIN
                      And some shit ll save your ass.  
                      Figuring out which is which, that s 
                      the fun part.

    Jax sees the Lexus, can t help but smile at the irony --

                                        JAX
                      Never know.  Some days you re the 
                      Lexus, some days you re the goddamn 
                      deer.  

                                          DUBLIN
                      Yuppie creamed it out by the streams.  

                                        JAX
                      He run into it or hit a tree while it 
                      was giving him head?

                                          HALF-SACK
                      How the hell do I get it out of there?

    Jax shares a smile with Dublin.  Opens a TOOL BIN on the tow 
      truck, pulls out a CHAIN SAW.  Hands it to Half-Sack.

                                          HALF-SACK
                      Oh, Christ...

      Half-Sack nods, hops into the truck.  Jax and Dublin watch --

                      Hear anything more  bout last night?

      THREE HARLEYS roar into the lot, the riders also have the 
      Teller-Morrow work shirts under SAMCRO colors.

                      We will now.

      CLAY MORROW, 63.  Tall, wiry.  Elaborate CELTIC TATTOOS on 
    his neck and forearms.  Old school.  He MASSAGES his hands as 
    he climbs off the bike.  Wears an expensive ROLEX.  

      With him, BOBBY MUNSON, 45.  Big boy, big smile.  A diamond 
      STAR OF DAVID around his neck.  HAWK SHAW, 40.  No smile.  A 
      thick red scar around his neck.  Hawk stays on the bike, 
      watches the street.  The men exchange hearty embraces -- 

                                        JAX
                      What s the word from the woods?

                      Don t ask.

      Clay and Bobby head to their Harleys.  Dublin walks to the 
      office.  As Jax heads to his bay, he makes a CELL CALL --  



      Jax, Clay, Bobby and Hawk roll up.  Harleys, colors.  Small 
      apartment building on a quiet street.  Hawk keeps watch.



      Clay and Hawk ride on a desolate road, engulfed in thick

      Inside the fencing is a large WAREHOUSE.  Roof blown off, 
      half-burnt to the ground.  YELLOW TAPE.  FIRE CREW finishes 
    up.  Uniformed San Joaquin County SHERIFFS mill about.

      Clay and Hawk dismount.  Walking toward them is SHERIFF VIC 
      TRAMMEL, 40 s.  Black.  Plain clothes, Rasta vibe.  Badass.

                      The blast was seen in two counties.  
                      This location s dead.

      Clay PUNCHES a hole in the side of the burnt building.  Reins 
    in his rage.  Pulls out a wad of CASH, peels off a chunk --

                                          CLAY
                      Get the fireman on board.  Don t want

                      Gotta see something else.



    As Clay and Hawk pull onto the highway, an old JEEP, top off, 
      passes them.  Police CHERRY on the dash.  Behind the wheel, 
    in uniform, ASSISTANT CHIEF DAVID HALE.  30 s.  Charming PD.  
      Looks like a baseball player.  Notices SAMCRO riding away.



    Jax steps through a crowded 8X10 storage unit.  Filled with 
    old baby furniture, boxes, typewriter, memory-charged junk.   
    Jax lights up when he sees a DAISY AIR RIFLE.  Turns boy.  
      Takes the rifle, sticks the end in the muddy gravel outside 
    the space and PUMPS the gun.  Takes aim and FIRES at some 
      BOXES.  Dirt and gravel fly.  Jax laughs.  

    As he makes his way to the baby stuff, he sees the box that 
    he hit with the mud bullet, it s a LARGE CARDBOARD BOX 
      sitting on top of a CHANGING TABLE.  It s labeled: JOHN MISC. 

    Jax opens the box.  Inside -- dirty BINDERS filled with 
      HARLEY REPAIR MANUALS, SPOOLS of SUPER 8 FILM, VHS TAPES and 
      PHOTOS: John in Vietnam, Gemma and John s wedding.  History.  
    As Jax digs through the contents, some of the HARLEY BINDERS 
      fall to the floor.  From inside of one of them, a thick 
      MANILA ENVELOPE slides out.  Labeled: ORIGINAL. 3/15/1991. 

    Jax picks it up.  Breaks the seal and slides out a 
      MANUSCRIPT.  Typewritten.  The title page reads: 

                          THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SAM CROW.  
                    HOW THE SONS OF ANARCHY LOST THEIR WAY.  
                                BY JOHN THOMAS TELLER.

    Jax turns the page, reads the DEDICATION.  He hears his 
      father s voice in his head --

                                          JOHN TELLER (V.O.)
                      For my sons.  Thomas, who is already 
                      at peace.  And Jackson, may he never 
                      know this life of chaos.

    Jax drops into a BABY ROCKING CHAIR, stares at the page.  

                                                                        SMASH TO:

                                            ACT ONE

      SMASH UP ON:



      Part of town they call Sam Crow s Corner.  Nice, middle-class 
      homes.  Americana.  Gemma walks to the front door.  Sees the 
      overgrown lawn, several days of newspapers and mail stacked 
    on the porch.  Concerned, she RINGS the bell.  No answer. 

      Gemma heads to the backyard.  Passes a WINDOW.  SEES inside -- 



    Jax and Clay exit.  Gemma, panicked --

                                          GEMMA
                      Tried calling.

                                        JAX
                      What is it?



    Jax KICK STARTS his Harley.  Bobby and Dublin do the same.  
    The RUMBLE is undeniable.  The men peel out of the lot.  



    Jax rides.  Alone.  The wind whipping through his colors.  
      Blowing off the rage.  He slows to a stop at an intersection.  
      Lets an elderly COUPLE cross.  AC Hale pulls up next to him 
    in the Jeep.

                                          HALE
                      How ya doing, Jax?
                          (off his nod)
                      Heard about Wendy and the baby.  
                      Sorry.

                                        JAX
                      Thanks.

      Intersection clear, Jax roars off.  Hale stays with him.  
      Outlaw and cop ride in tandem, the interrogation continues --

                                          HALE
                      Took a ride out to streams today.  Saw

                      Something blows up that close to your 
                      town, be bad law enforcement not to 
                      look into it.

                      Not much.  Sanwa Sheriff shooed me 
                      off.

                      him not to.

                                          HALE
                      Saw Clay and Hawk riding out of the 
                      woods.  Guess they were curious, too.

                                        JAX
                      Between you and me, I think they re a 
                      little too curious, those two disappear 
                      into the woods together all the time.

    RED LIGHT.  Idling.  No love between Sam Crow and John Law.

    Jax ROARS off the line as the light turns green.

      hardhats, chain saws, axes, exit the WOODS.  Break time.

                      being around.  
                          (fucks with him)
                      Kids gotta get used to how ugly their 
                      dad is.  

      Opie realizes --

                      How s Wendy doing?  She s what, like 
                      six, seven months now?

    Jax doesn t have the energy or desire to reveal the truth --

                                        JAX
                      Yeah.
                          (shifts focus back)
                      Things always have a way of working 
                      out.  Donna knows what the life is.

                      Leave a woman alone for five years.  
                      Two kids.  Only thing they knowis 
                      they don t want it to happen again.

                                        JAX
                      It won thappen again.  

      Opie s FOREMAN waves him over.  Opie s in --

                      Let me know when you need me.  

      They embrace.  



    The front is lined with Harleys.  We see Half-Sack with three 
      HANG-AROUNDS watching the front.  Sentries.  



    We see Half-Sack, half-sad, carrying the deer head to a full 
      DUMPSTER.  ANTLERS stick out.  Jax and Dublin watch -- 

                                        JAX
                      Good thing he s got a lot of heart.

    In front of the clubhouse we now see club members with 
      FRIENDS and CROW EATERS.  Music blares from a car stereo.  
      Booze, joints.  It s a party.  Several members do WHEELIES up 
    and down the block.  LOCALS look on, enjoying the fun. 

      Opie helps Piney hook his oxygen to a makeshift tank holder 
    on his handlebars.  Motherfucker still rides.  

      Clay, Hawk and Bobby exit the clubhouse, join Jax and Dublin.  

    Jax approaches the house.  Doors and windows are all open.  
      Gemma s 760 in the driveway.  Jax enters to find --



    AC David Hale crouches over the BLOODY BODY of a LATINO MAN.  
    Two CHARMING UNIFORM OFFICERS (UNIS) with him.  The dead man 
      wears an empty shoulder HOLSTER and cell phone SHEATH.  Hale, 
      wearing latex gloves, carefully checks the body.  

                                          HALE
                      Looks like three shots to the back.  
                      Small caliber.  This guy definitely 
                      took it on the run.

      Hale slides out a BUSINESS CARD:  BLUE BIRD INDUSTRIES.

                                          HALE

                      extra mile, this is a Charming murder.  

      Hale puts the card and wallet in an EVIDENCE BAG.  To Uni 1 --

                      Get the CSTs out here.  Backtrack his

                      to search that warehouse.  It s now 
                      part of a murder investigation.



    We see Jax walking up the driveway.  

      Opie grabs the duffle.  As he walks out, Donna grabs the bag.  
      Feels the WEIGHT.  Opie rips it from her hand.

                                          DONNA
                      You promised me you were done with 
                      this!

                      It s got nothing to do with you.

      Donna s fear turns rageful --

                                          DONNA
                      I m the one who gets shit on if you 
                      get caught again.

                      You sat in a cell for five years while 
                      Clay and the others got rich.  They 
                      sold you out.  You know that.  You re 
                      just too weak to stand up to them!

      Opie SLAMS her up against the wall.  Donna SLAPS him.  They 
      hear CRYING.  Opie s girls, SASHA, 9 and ELLIE, 6, are in the 
      doorway.  Traumatized.  Balling.

                                          OPIE
                      Shit.

      Donna runs inside, grabs the kids.  SLAMS the door.  Opie 
      PUNCHES his fist through the drywall.  

      Opie turns sees Jax standing in the driveway.  Watching.  
      Opie decompresses.  Picks up the duffle.  Joins him --

      Jax, on his Harley, the duffle strapped down to the back of 
    his bike, takes in his small town.  A pack of high school 
      GIRLS see him.  Watch in awe.  Jax smiles.  

    As he turns a corner, he s joined by Clay and Hawk on their 
      Harleys.  Clay sidles up next to him at a RED LIGHT --

                                          CLAY
                      Where s Op?

                      Kid got hurt.  Rushed her to the ER.  
                          (re: duffle)
                      Got the kit.  I can make it work.  
                      It s all good.

      Clay stares at Jax.  Gauging the truth.  GREEN LIGHT.  The 
    men roar off.  

      A few blocks later, Dublin pulls out of a side street, joins 
    the formation.  

    As they pass a residential area, Rosco fills out the field.  

      Locals have no choice but to take notice of Sam Crow as the 
    pop of the Harleys bitch-slap their central nervous systems.



    The MC heads out of town.  Clay in front.  Jax behind him, 
      flanking his right.  Hawk behind Jax, flanking his left.  
      Dublin and Rosco bring up the rear.  There s dignity in the 
      formation.  Leather-clad warriors.

      Sons of Anarchy MC, Redwood Original, on a mission.  Revenge.

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.

                                          ACT THREE

      SMASH UP ON:



    An old beater VAN cruises a quiet stretch of industrial road.  
    The only thing in sight is a COMMERCIAL STORAGE FACILITY.  
      Three long buildings, each with four large storage units.  

                                            51  Sons of Anarchy - "Pilot" - Network Ninth Draft - 10/31/0747




      Jax, Clay, Hawk, Dublin and Rosco slip out of the van.  
      Everyone in dark clothes.  No colors.  Hustle over to the 
      storage units.  No guard, but the yard is brightly lit, 
      protected by SECURITY CAMERAS and surrounded by barbed-wire.  

      Jax, with BOLTCUTTERS, Hawk with an AXE, head to a power SUB-
      STATION.  Jax CUTS the padlock on the gate.  Hawk CLEAVES a 
      thick cable in two.  Lights, cameras, alarms BLACKOUT.  Hawk 
      flashes a rare SMILE as they head back.  Clay and the others 
      have CUT THROUGH the fence and are inside --



      Clay signals them into action.  They pair up and stealthily 
      move to the buildings.  CUTTING the padlocks that secure the 
      large roll-up doors.  The men search the units.  



    Jax has several six-packs of construction-grade TNT laid out.  
      Slow going.  Unsure what wires to attach to the firing caps.  
      Pulls out a PREPAY CELL.  Tries to dial out -- NO RECEPTION.  

                                        JAX
                      Shit.

      Clay anxiously checks his watch.  Walks over to Jax --

                                          CLAY
                      You said you could make this work.

                                        JAX
                      Just double-checking.  Almost got it.

      Hawk, standing watch, spots HEADLIGHTS approaching --

                                          HAWK
                      We got company.  

                                          CLAY
                      Goddamn it.

    Jax scoops up the TNT.  They rush back into the storage unit.



      A MAN wearing a gray HOODIE, call him THE SENTRY, opens the 
      front gate, letting a PICKUP TRUCK pull inside.  The Sentry 
      checks out an ELECTRICAL PANEL as four other MEN hop out of 
    the truck.  No urgency.  Three of them wear SNAKESKIN boots 
    and colors -- MAYANS MC, OAKLAND.  The fourth man wears a 
      knit cap and a denim shirt, call him DENIM SHIRT GUY.

    Jax and Clay watch from the shadows.  DID NOT SEE The Sentry.

                                          CLAY
                      We should ve been long gone by now.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                      Came here to send a message.

                      these guys, could trigger something 
                      runs out of control.  Bodies ll drop

                      You have a problem with that?

    Jax knows this is a test.  Leadership, loyalty.  Then --

                      I ll draw  em to the middle.  

      Clay heads inside.  Jax takes off his boots, wraps himself in 
      a CARGO BLANKET, grabs a bag of garbage from a trash can.  He 
      walks into the yard.  MUMBLING.  Before the Mayans can 
      investigate the units, they see Jax, the crazy homeless guy.

                                          MAYAN 1

      Mayan 1 and 2 head over to Jax, as Denim Shirt Guy and Mayan 
      3 join The Sentry at the electrical panel.

                      property.  

      Jax, mumbles LOUDER as he crosses to the center of the yard.  
    He pulls out his dick, starts PEEING, oblivious to the men.

                      Probably took a shit on the 
                        transformer, knocked out the power.

      Mayan 1 spins Jax around.  Jax cowers, playing the role --

                                          MAYAN 1
                      This look like some kinda Holiday Inn 
                      to you, man?  Huh?

    The two Mayans don t see Sam Crow moving up behind them.  

                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      CONTINUED: (2)

                                          MAYAN 2
                      Tell your dirtbag buddies, they try to 
                      camp out here, they get some of this --

    He SMASHES Jax in the face.  Splits his eyebrow.  Before he 
      gets a second punch, Jax pulls out his 9MM and PISTOL WHIPS 
      Mayan 2 across the face.  Mayan 1 reaches for his weapon, but 
      Clay and the others are on them, GUNS out.  Jax disarms Mayan 
    2, Clay rips the gun from Mayan 1 s hand --

                                          CLAY
                      Tell yourdirtbag buddies, they steal 
                      from Sam Crow, they get some of this --

      Clay SHOOTS Mayan 1 in the throat.  Point blank.  Instant 
      death.  Mayan 2 watches the execution.  Fear and loathing.

    The Sentry is out of sight, but Mayan 3 and Denim Shirt Guy 
      hear the attack.  They run over and open FIRE.  Sam Crow 
      takes cover.  Returns FIRE.  Denim Shirt Guy takes a BULLET 
    in the head.  Dead.  Mayan 3, outnumbered, RUNS to the truck.  

                                          HAWK
                      Got  em.

      Hawk bolts.  Mayan 3 hops in the pickup.  As it pulls away, 
      Hawk jumps in the bed, FIRES four shots through the back 
      window.  The Mayan slumps at the wheel, the vehicle swerves 
      wildly.  Hawk DIVES OUT, as the truck CRASHES into a wall.    

      Clay stares at Mayan 2.  Deep hatred between these MCs.

                                          MAYAN 2
                      Conky bitches ain t shit.  Sons gonna 
                      be wiped off the MC map.

                                          CLAY
                      Too bad you re not gonna be around to 
                      enjoy that.
                          (to Jax)
                      He s all yours.

      Jax, 9MM out, shoves the Latino toward the open storage unit.  
      Clay watches Jax.  After a moment, he follows his stepson.  

    Sam Crow is still unaware that The Sentry is on the property.  
    We see the hooded man hide behind one of the units.  Armed.



    The guys in the yard empty GAS CANS all over the property. 

      Clay lights a HOLY CANDLE, throws it into the OPEN STORAGE 
      UNIT.  WHOOSH.  Place 

                                          CLAY
                      Let s go home.



    The beater van heads down the quiet road.  The ORANGE GLOW of 
      a fire in the distance.  An EXPLOSION.  Ass-blowing loud.  

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.
                                      END OF ACT THREE

                                          ACT FOUR

      SMASH UP ON:



    We see HANDS grab ANTLERS and pull the DEER HEAD out of the 
      dumpster.  Young buck, rescued.
