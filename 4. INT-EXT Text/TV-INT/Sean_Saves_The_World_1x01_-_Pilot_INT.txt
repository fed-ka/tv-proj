                Did you finish your homework?  

                                  ELLIE

                Yes.

                                  SEAN

                Did you rehearse all your  West Side 

                Story  songs?  

                                  ELLIE

                S . 

                                  SEAN

                How s ninth grade?  You need advice 

                about boys?  You are a smart, strong 

                young woman, so screw boys.  (THEN)  

                Just so we re clear, I m not saying 

                 screw boys,  like,  go, do that.   

                I m saying--

                What s happening right now?            Victor Fresco - 1/24/122.


                                  SEAN

                  (PROUDLY)  I m single parenting!  I 

                read a book last night.  Some of it.            

                                  ELLIE

                Don t read things, Dad, don t do that.   

                                  SEAN

                Good, we re communicating.  You don t  

                like it when people read.  I didn t 

                know that.  Is there anything about me 

                you d like to know?   

                                  ELLIE

                How do I get you to stop this?

                                  SEAN

                Come on, Ellie.  Your mom just moved 

                away, this is our first week living 

                  together, that can t be easy.  I want 

                to help you.  

                                  ELLIE

                I don t need your help.

                                  SEAN

                The book disagrees.

                                  ELLIE

                Okay, fine.  There is something I want 

                to know.  

                                  SEAN

                  Excellent.  Anything.  Let s talk it 

                out.             Victor Fresco - 1/24/123.


                                  ELLIE

                If you re gay, how did you and Mom 

                have sex? 

                                  SEAN

                Yeah, that book is stupid.  

                                  ELLIE

                Okay, I see how this works.

      REJECTED, ELLIE TURNS BACK TO FIXING HER LUNCH.  SEAN LOOKS 
      AT HER, RECONSIDERS.

                                  SEAN

                All right, it was a long time ago, but 

                here s what happened: Gay.  Tried not to 

                be.  Was.  Was again.  Was one more time 

                because it was not unpleasant.  Am.  

                                  ELLIE

                So, was  was,  and all the other  was-

                es,  with one guy, or--

                                  SEAN

                First of all, there wasn t that much 

                was-ing.  Although, one was-ing was 

                with a bear.  Who had no hair.  So it 

                wasn t a very fuzzy was-ing, was it?  

                Still, we made do.

                school.             Victor Fresco - 1/24/124.


      SEAN LOOKS INTO ELLIE S EYES, SPEAKS MEANINGFULLY.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)

                Listen to me.  I am going to work 

                today, but I promise you I will be 

                home for dinner.

                                  ELLIE

                Are you going to work as a Navy SEAL?

                                  SEAN

                I m saying, I took the week off to 

                help you get settled, but I love our 

                dinners together, and we re going to 

                keep doing that.  You will always have 

                a home that s supportive and loving--

                (YELLING TOWARD THE DOOR)  Calm down, 

                you maniac, I m parenting!

      SEAN S MOTHER, LORNA, YELLS BACK AS SEAN CROSSES. 

                                  LORNA (O.S.)

                The good ones can do it and open a 

                door at the same time.

      SEAN TAKES A BREATH, PREPARING HIMSELF, THEN OPENS THE DOOR, 
      REVEALING LORNA.

                                  LORNA (CONT D)

                Is it still Monday?  Because I ve been 

                out here since Monday.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/125.


                                  SEAN

                Hi, Mom.  Thank you for helping this 

                morning. 

      LORNA COMES IN.  

                                  LORNA

                Of course.  How s my baby?

                                  SEAN

                I m okay.  Going from  fun weekend 

                parent  to  responsible full-time 

                parent  is daunting, and frankly--

                                  LORNA

                Not you.  Ellie.  Poor girl.  Her 

                mother abandons her-- now she has no 

                one.  No one.

                                  SEAN

                Jill didn t abandon her.  She took a 

                job, and Ellie chose to live here so 

                she could stay at school with her 

                friends.  And wait, I just remembered 

                someone she has.  Me.  I remembered 

                me.  What a relief, now we can cancel 

                that Ellie-Has-No-One telethon.

                                  LORNA

                Of course she has you.  But you have a 

                lot on your plate.  A teenage 

                  daughter; that fantastic, gorgeous man 

                you finally found who dumped you; 

                                  (MORE)            Victor Fresco - 1/24/126.

                                  LORNA (CONT'D)

                  a terrible new boss.  I just don t see 

                how this is going to work.

                                  SEAN

                Are you aware that sometimes you re 

                  negative?

                                  LORNA

                Listen to how you tear into me.

      ELLIE COMES OVER, READY TO GO.

                                  ELLIE

                Hi, Grandma.  Are you communicating 

                with your son?  That s super important 

                for a child.  

                                  LORNA

                I m trying, sweetheart, but he doesn t 

                make it easy.   

                                  ELLIE

                I know.  Plus, he kept you waiting 

                outside for, like, a day.

                                  SEAN

                Okay, both of you, off you go.  (TO 

                ELLIE)  Don t be late; we re having 

                dinner.

                                  ELLIE

                And look how bossy he is.

      AS SEAN USHERS LORNA AND ELLIE OUT THE DOOR, WE:

                                                                              CUT TO:            Victor Fresco - 1/24/127.


                          SCENE B



        (SEAN, LIZ, MORGAN, HUNTER, MAX VOICE (V.O.))

      SEAN IS AT HIS DESK, LOOKING AT SOME PAPERWORK, AS LIZ 
      ENTERS.

                                  LIZ

                I hate the new owner.  He s mean; he 

                knows nothing about online retail-- 

                why are you shaking your head?

      A VOICE COMES FROM THE SPEAKERPHONE.

                                  MAX (THROUGH SPEAKERPHONE)

                Because he s on the phone with the new 

                owner.

      LIZ IS HORRIFIED.  SEAN SMILES, INTRIGUED BY HER SUDDEN 
      SITUATION.

                                  LIZ

                  (COVERING)  Ohhhh, not you, Max.  

                You re great.  I was talking about the 

                new owner of...  (STUCK)

                                  SEAN

                That deli down the street?

                                  LIZ

                Yeah, that guy.  He knows nothing 

                about online retail.   

                                  SEAN

                Which is a subject Liz cares deeply 

                about.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/128.


                                  LIZ

                And so I hate him.

                                  MAX (THROUGH SPEAKERPHONE)

                Not buyin  it.  Sean, pull those 

                numbers, I ll look at them when I get 

                in.  I ll see you later, too, Liz.

                                  LIZ

                Sounds good, Max.  Love you.

      SEAN CLICKS OFF.  

                                  SEAN

                You love him?  That s confusing.

                                  LIZ

                    I overcompensated!  You have to help 

                me.  I can t lose this job and go back 

                to being a therapist, with people 

                always doing dumb things then asking 

                me to help them.    

                                  SEAN

                I ll fix it.  But maybe you shouldn t 

                just walk into rooms talking.  

                                  LIZ

                How was I supposed to know you were on 

                the speakerphone?      

      MORGAN ENTERS.  SHE STANDS QUIETLY A MOMENT.

                                  SEAN

                Yes?            Victor Fresco - 1/24/129.


                                  MORGAN

                I was waiting to see if you were on 

                the speakerphone.  

                                  LIZ

                  Seriously?  That s something people 

                do?

                                  MORGAN

                Careful people.  (TRYING TO BE 

                  POSITIVE)  Guess who I m meeting with 

                later.  The new owner.  What fun!  The 

                way he makes everyone feel bad, like 

                we re idiots and don t work hard 

                enough.  (TO SEAN)  Do you have any 

                Ativan?  I left mine at home.

                                  SEAN

                Morgan, Ativan is a prescription 

                  medication.  It would be against the 

                law--

                                  MORGAN

                I can t function!  

                                  SEAN

                There is, however, no law against 

                saying where I keep mine: in my left 

                drawer.  And whether I think you 

                should help yourself when I m not 

                here: I do.

      HUNTER ENTERS HOLDING A STEPLADDER.              Victor Fresco - 1/24/1210.


                                  HUNTER

                Have you seen these new stepladders 

                Max wants us to sell?  They re 

                  unworthy.  

      HUNTER OPENS IT, IT S RICKETY.

                                  HUNTER (CONT D)

                So, are we going from a place that 

                sells quality designer products to one 

                that sells garbage?  Because I will 

                not stand for that!  I will if I have 

                to.  But it is not okay!  Unless 

                that s the drill.  I don t want there 

                to be any confusion: I need this job.  

                My band is not making the kind of 

                money I d hoped.  Plus, I think our 

                bass player is ripping us off.         

                                  SEAN

                Okay, I think we all agree, you do 

                need a more honest bass player.  And 

                things have not been easy with Max. 

                                  MORGAN

                (TO SEAN)  Everybody s freaking out.  

                                  HUNTER

                You need to do something.              Victor Fresco - 1/24/1211.


                                  LIZ

                And make sure Max doesn t think that I 

                hate him, because I don t... want him 

                to think that I do, which I do.

                                  SEAN

                  (STANDING)  All right.  I will saddle 

                up and go save the day.  

      SEAN HEADS FOR THE DOOR WITH THE OTHERS IN TOW.

                                  LIZ

                 Saddle up?   That s new.

                                  SEAN

                I tried reading a parenting book last 

                night but ended up watching a Western 

                instead.

      AS THEY CONTINUE OUT THE DOOR, WE:

                                                                            RESET TO:            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1212.

        (SEAN, LIZ, MORGAN, HUNTER, HOWARD, MAX, OTHER OFFICE 
        WORKERS)

      IT S AN OPEN SPACE WHERE ABOUT EIGHT PEOPLE WORK AT DESKS.  
      SEAN, LIZ, MORGAN AND HUNTER ENTER FROM SEAN S OFFICE.  

                                  SEAN

                Can I get everyone s attention?  I 

                want to talk to you about Max.

      A MAN, HOWARD, SPEAKS.

                                  HOWARD

                Did he quit?

                                  SEAN

                No, Howard, he s the owner.  Owners 

                don t quit their jobs owning things.    

                                  LIZ

                But Sean s going to talk to him and 

                get him to stop being such a tyrant!    

      THE GROUP CHEERS.   

                                  GROUP

                Yay, Sean! 

                                  MORGAN

                And maybe to smile more and not go 

                like this  (STAMPS HER FOOT)  to 

                people he thinks are afraid of him.

      THE GROUP CHEERS.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1213.


                                  HUNTER

                And to stop selling inferior 

                  merchandise.  And give us more time 

                for lunch.  Enough so we can write 

                music, or poetry, or make love.      

      THE GROUP CHEERS.  

                                  SEAN

                I m not going to talk to him about any 

                of those things.

      THEY FALL SILENT, SAVE FOR LIZ.

                                  LIZ

                Boooo. 

                                  SEAN

                Max only bought this place a few weeks 

                ago.  We need to give him some time.   

                Let him see how good we are, how well 

                things run.  He ll calm down.   

      HOWARD RAISES HIS HAND.  

                                  HOWARD

                I ve been reading about ants.

                                  SEAN

                I know, Howard, we talked about them 

                  yesterday.  My takeaway: how ants do 

                things is not always relevant.    

                                  HOWARD

                Ants sacrifice themselves for their 

                  communities, Sean.  Okay?  

                                  (MORE)            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1214.

                                  HOWARD (CONT'D)

                They re heroes.  Maybe we should 

                  sacrifice someone-- get Max to focus 

                all his cruelty on one person, thereby 

                leaving the rest of us alone.

                                  SEAN

                No.  Because we are not ants.  We re 

                people, and people stick together-- 

                not sacrifice each other like insects, 

                which are tiny, gross, and for some 

                reason, like, angry all the time. 

      MAX ENTERS.  HE S IN A SOUR MOOD.

                                  MAX

                What s going on?  Why s everyone 

                standing around?

      HOWARD POINTS AT SOMEONE.

                                  HOWARD

                It s Greg s fault!  And so we 

                  sacrifice him!   

                                  MAX

                Greg... I knew he was a problem.

                                  SEAN

                It s not Greg, and there s no problem.  

                We were just getting psyched up, so 

                  (MOTIVATING TEAM) we can be the best 

                online retail company in America! 

                  (CHANTING) I say  online,  you say 

                   retail.    Online! --               Victor Fresco - 1/24/1215.


                                  MAX

                Yeah, let s do that later.  Maybe 

                during your lunch.  By the way, 

                starting today, everyone s going to be 

                working a few hours later every 

                evening.

                                  SEAN

                  Because...?

                                  MAX

                I said so?

                                  SEAN

                And...?

                                  MAX

                That should be enough?

                                  SEAN

                Only...

                                  MORGAN

                It s not?  Sorry.  Sometimes I like 

                seeing if I can tell what people are 

                about to say.

                                  MAX

                Our competition killed us with those 

                throw pillows last week.  We need to 

                own  Home and Kitchen.   If working 

                late s a problem for you people, for a 

                bowl of noodles, I could get a billion 

                Chinese in here.  Hey, Liz.  Love you.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1216.


      MAX EXITS TO HIS OFFICE.  

                                  LIZ

                Love you, too.  (RE: MAX)  I guess 

                that s going to be our thing.  (THEN)  

                Well, this sucks.  

                                  SEAN

                (TO GROUP)  It ll be fine.  We just 

                have to show him we ll do whatever he 

                needs and stay as late as he wants.  

                (THEN, TO LIZ)  Although, there s no 

                way I can stay as late as he wants.  

                                  LIZ

                I know, none of us--

                                  SEAN

                No, I promised Ellie we d have dinner, 

                and the book was very clear:  Never 

                make promises you can t keep.   Or 

                maybe that was the Western.  Either 

                way, it seemed important.



                                                                      CUT TO BLACK.

                                        SCENE D



      FADE IN:

        (SEAN, MAX)

      MAX SITS AT HIS DESK AS SEAN ENTERS WITH PAPERWORK.  

                                  SEAN

                (HANDING IT TO HIM)  Here are those 

                numbers you wanted, buddy. 

                                  MAX

                Buddy?  No.  

                                  SEAN

                Just finding the parameters.  So, that 

                Liz thing on the phone this morning--

                                  MAX

                When she said she hates the new owner?

                                  SEAN

                Yeah, only it turns out what she 

                actually said was,  I ain t the new 

                owner,  like:  You can say what you 

                want, but I ain t the new owner... 

                  girlfriend. 

                                  MAX

                Why would she suddenly start talking 

                like that?              Victor Fresco - 1/24/1218.


                                  SEAN

                I don t know.  Maybe it was an attempt 

                to be less formal.  More folksy.  I m 

                not saying it was successful, I don t 

                think it was.  I m just clearing it 

                up.  Which I think I ve done.   

      MAX CONTINUES LOOKING OVER THE PAPERWORK SEAN GAVE HIM.  

                                  SEAN (CONT D)

                So, my daughter, Ellie-- she s 

                  fourteen, not an easy age, right?  (NO 

                  RESPONSE)  No, it is not.  Her mom and 

                  I divorced right after she was born 

                and now I m raising her on my own-- 

                which, is going to be a challenge... 

                (SOBER)  an exciting challenge.  

                Anyway, consistency s important-- all 

                the books and Westerns say so-- so I 

                promised I d make us dinner tonight.  

                Chicken Parmesan.  Although, if I m 

                home early enough, maybe I ll roast a 

                duck.  So, menu: undecided.  

      MAX LOOKS UP FROM THE PAPERWORK.  

                                  MAX

                Sean, one of the reasons I bought this 

                company is because of you.

                                  SEAN

                Really?  Go on.  My thing can wait.                Victor Fresco - 1/24/1219.


                                  MAX

                You have good taste; you ve picked 

                great products for this place to sell.  

                That Foroni desk lamp you liked?  I 

                thought it looked like a toothbrush 

                stuck in a turd.  But you were right, 

                it was a hit.  

                                  SEAN

                  (MODESTLY)  Yeah, it was.  

                                  MAX

                You re also a good manager.   

                                  SEAN

                I try to be.

                                  MAX

                You set an example for everyone.

                                  SEAN

                I really do.

                                  MAX

                So you can t leave early today.  

                                  SEAN

                What?

                                  MAX

                If I let you go just to have dinner 

                with your daughter, everyone s going 

                to want to go have dinner with their 

                stupid families.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1220.


                                  SEAN

                Okay, forget the duck.  Who makes duck 

                on a weekday?  What if I just left 

                early enough for a simple soup?

                                  MAX

                Soup is better.  

                                  SEAN

                I think so.

                                  MAX

                When you get home.  Which will be 

                after dinner.

                                                                              CUT TO:            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1221.




                           SCENE E



        (SEAN, ELLIE)

      SEAN ENTERS TO FIND ELLIE WAITING FOR HIM.    

                                  SEAN

                Ellie.  Is everything all right?

                                  ELLIE

                  Everything s fine.  I was on my way 

                home from school and felt like saying 

                hello.  I m so glad I m living with 

                you. 

      SHE SNUGGLES UP TO HIM.

                                  SEAN

                Awww.  That s nice.  I like this part.  

                (THEN)  You don t have an agenda, do 

                you?

                                  ELLIE

                No, you paranoid man.  By the way, Liz 

                said you guys are kind of busy, and 

                I ve got a lot going on, so it s okay 

                if we can t have dinner tonight.

                                  SEAN

                Really?  That d be great because I m 

                supposed to work late.             Victor Fresco - 1/24/1222.


                                  ELLIE

                Cool.  Then I ll just see you when I 

                get home.

                                  SEAN

                Cool.  (THEN)  Wait.  You mean, you ll 

                see me when I get home.  

                                  ELLIE

                We ll both see each other at home.  

                That s what s important.

                                  SEAN

                No.  Because saying you ll see me when 

                you get home implies that you re going 

                out.  

                                  ELLIE

                Huh.  I m not seeing that.

                                  SEAN

                Why didn t you want to have dinner 

                with me tonight?

                                  ELLIE

                Because you can t.

                                  SEAN

                No, that s why I didn t want to.

                                  ELLIE

                Right.  So we ll do it another time.

                Ellie.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1223.


                                  ELLIE

                Okay, I made plans.

                                  SEAN

                Ah-ha!  An agenda!    

                                  ELLIE

                You can t have dinner anyway.  

                                  SEAN

                Which you didn t know when you made 

                plans. 

                                  ELLIE

                Right.  So, it all works out.

                                  SEAN

                I don t think so.  What plans did you 

                make, knowing we were having dinner?

                                  ELLIE

                Cash, the guy who plays Tony to my 

                Maria, invited me to his house so we 

                can rehearse and stuff.

                                  SEAN

                And stuff?  

                                  ELLIE

                --And do homework.  So I can keep 

                doing well in things I don t care 

                about, which in my experience is how 

                you re going to judge your parenting.              Victor Fresco - 1/24/1224.


                                  SEAN

                I m sorry.  No  stuff  with a guy 

                named  Cash.   We made plans and we 

                are having dinner tonight.  

                                  ELLIE

                But you re working!

                                  SEAN

                No, I m not.  And if you keep this up, 

                you may never get a duck.  

                                                                              CUT TO:            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1225.

        (SEAN, MORGAN, HUNTER)

      MORGAN AND HUNTER ARE WORKING AS SEAN PACES NERVOUSLY.  
      MORGAN STUDIES A PAIR OF SIDE TABLES AS SHE PITCHES IDEAS.  

                                  MORGAN

                What about: these eye-catching side 

                tables add an elegance to any room--    

                                  SEAN

                It s six o clock.  I have to go.

                                  HUNTER

                Then go.

                                  SEAN

                I can t go.  Max won t let me. 

                                  HUNTER

                Then stay.

                                  SEAN

                I can t stay.  

                                  HUNTER

                Then stay.

                                  SEAN

                You mean, go.

                                  HUNTER

                You said you can t go.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1226.


                                  SEAN

                I can t.

                                  HUNTER

                So go!

                                  SEAN

                You mean, stay.

                                  HUNTER

                You can t stay!

                                  MORGAN

                Don t stop.  You almost have it 

                figured out.  (THEN)  Just cancel 

                Ellie.  It s a good life lesson: 

                people let you down; you re on your 

                own.  Find a medication that works for 

                you, and keep it in your purse.       

                                  HUNTER

                Don t cancel Ellie.  Be bold.  Sneak 

                out the bathroom window and flee.  

                                  SEAN

                I m not sneaking out the bathroom 

                window.

                                  HUNTER

                But the rear door s alarmed, and it s 

                the only one that opens.  Think, Sean.

                                  SEAN

                I m just going to tell Max I m 

                leaving.  I m not afraid of him.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1227.


                                  MORGAN

                Really?  What s that like?

                                  SEAN

                I don t know.  It must be great.  

      SEAN HEADS OUT OF HIS OFFICE.

                                                                            RESET TO:            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1228.

        (SEAN, MAX)

      MAX IS NEAR THE FRONT DOOR LOOKING AT SOME PAPERS.  SEAN 
      MARCHES UP TO HIM PURPOSEFULLY. 

                                  MAX

                What.

      SEAN SPEAKS WITH CONFIDENCE.

                                  SEAN

                Love the new side tables.  

      SEAN TURNS AND HEADS BACK TO HIS OFFICE.

                                                                              CUT TO:            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1229.

      HUNTER AND MORGAN ARE WHERE WE LEFT THEM, AS SEAN ENTERS.

                                  MORGAN

                How d it go?  I m thinking not great. 

                                  HUNTER

                Just climb out the bathroom window 

                like a normal person.   

                                  SEAN

                I m not climbing out a window.  I m  

                just gonna tell him.  (PRACTICING)  

                 Max, I m going home.    Max, I m 

                going home.    Max, I am outta 

                here... 

      SEAN CONFIDENTLY WALKS OUT.

                                                                              CUT TO:            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1230.

                Max-- 

                                  MAX

                If this is about you leaving early, 

                you can t.  

                                  SEAN

                That s fine with me.

      SEAN TURNS AND WALKS AWAY.

        (SEAN)

      SEAN, ALONE, STUDIES A SMALL SLIDING HORIZONTAL WINDOW HIGH 
      ON THE WALL, THE UPPER WINDOW FRAME BORDERING THE CEILING.  
      HE LOOKS AROUND.  SEVERAL STEPLADDERS, THE TYPE WE SAW HUNTER 
      WITH PREVIOUSLY, ARE STACKED NEARBY.  SEAN TAKES ONE AND 
      OPENS IT UP.  HE DRAGS OVER A WOODEN CRATE, PUTS THE 
      STEPLADDER ON IT, AND STARTS TO CLIMB.  THE STEPLADDER IS AS 
      RICKETY AS HUNTER HAD SAID.  WITH EACH STEP, SEAN WOBBLES A 
      LITTLE MORE UNTIL FINALLY HE RETREATS BACK DOWN.  

                                                                              CUT TO:            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1232.

        (SEAN, LIZ, HUNTER)

      LIZ AND HUNTER ARE WALKING BY THE BATHROOM.  THEY HEAR A 
      CRASH AND LOOK AT EACH OTHER.  AFTER A BEAT, THE BATHROOM 
      DOOR SLOWLY OPENS AND SEAN SPEAKS QUIETLY.

                                  SEAN (O.S.)

                I could use some help.

      LIZ AND HUNTER ENTER THE BATHROOM TO FIND SEAN STANDING WITH 
      ONE LEG IN EACH TABLE.   

                                  LIZ

                Why are you wearing tables on your 

                legs?

                                  SEAN

                I m trying to find ways to make 

                walking more difficult.  This one s 

                the winner.    

                                  HUNTER

                You were sneaking out.  Good for you, 

                being bold.   

                                  SEAN

                Yeah, I m feeling really good about 

                myself.  Just get these off me.

      SEAN LIES ON HIS BACK AND LIZ AND HUNTER PULL THE SIDE TABLES 
      FROM HIS LEGS.  SEAN STANDS, CROSSES TO THE WINDOW, AND MOVES 
      THE CRATE.                Victor Fresco - 1/24/1235.


                                  SEAN (CONT D)

                All right, hoist me up.   

                                  LIZ

                Why don t you just tell Max--

                                  SEAN

                I m so past that now.

      LIZ AND HUNTER EACH LACE THEIR FINGERS TOGETHER.  SEAN STEPS 
      UP, ONE FOOT IN EACH SET OF HIS FRIENDS  HANDS, AND THEY 
      STRUGGLE TO LIFT HIM TOWARD THE WINDOW.

                                  LIZ

                At least all those stupid teamwork 

                seminars are finally paying off.

      SLOWLY PICKING HER WAY THROUGH THE SONG  TONIGHT  FROM  WEST 
      SIDE STORY.

                Do you like tomatoes in your salad?

                I don t care.

                Okay, I know you re mad.

                I don t care.  

                                  SEAN

                You wanted to be with your Tony 

                tonight, and I m making you stick to

                She left-- thank you, Mom-- but that 

                doesn t mean I need your help 

                   adjusting  or  settling in  or with 

                boys, or anything.  

      ELLIE GOES BACK TO PICKING AT THE SONG, BADLY.  SEAN WEIGHS 
      WHAT TO DO, CROSSES TO HIS DAUGHTER AND SITS NEXT TO HER. 

                                  SEAN

                I know you don t want to get all 

                  communication-y, but that  thank you, 

                Mom  thing seems worth exploring. 

                                  ELLIE

                I m fine.  

                                  SEAN

                I think we should talk about her 

                leaving.  You.  Leaving you.

                                  ELLIE

                No.  I could ve gone with her if I 

                wanted to.  I didn t want to.  

                                  SEAN

                Still... she left.

                And that s fine.  (WITH ATTITUDE)  I 

                don t need my mommy.  And I don t need 

                you always trying to help me.   

      THEY SIT IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT AS ELLIE CONTINUES POKING AT

                  understand.  But you re butchering 

                this song, so I m helping it, not you.

      HE HANGS UP, TURNS TO ELLIE.  DURING THE FOLLOWING, ELLIE 
      BECOMES INCREASINGLY ALARMED.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)

                That was my boss.  He wants to see me.  

                                  ELLIE

                Now?  Why?

                                  SEAN

                I kind of snuck out to get home, and 

                my friends who were going to cover for 

                me, I guess, you know, failed totally 

                to do that.

                                  ELLIE

                You snuck out?

                                  SEAN

                Not literally.  I just left early... 

                through a window.  

                                  ELLIE

                  (WORRIED)  Oh, God.  Are you going to 

                get fired?

                                  SEAN

                You are.  

                                  SEAN

                He just wants me to run over to The 

                Jupiter and talk to him.  

                                  ELLIE

                The Jupiter?  Is that a strip club?              Victor Fresco - 1/24/1241.


                                  SEAN

                It s a hotel.  He s only been here a 

                few weeks and doesn t have a place 

                yet. 

                                  ELLIE

                You re lying.  He s a bad man.  Liz 

                said.  He s going to take you into a 

                back room at a strip joint and beat 

                you with a golf club.  I ve seen 

                movies.  

                                  SEAN

                What kind of business do you think I m 

                in?

                                  ELLIE

                I told you we didn t have to have 

                dinner.  I told you!  

      ELLIE RUNS OUT.  

                                  SEAN

                (CALLING AFTER HER)  Ellie, it s going 

                to be fine.  (THEN)  God, I hope The 

                  Jupiter s a hotel.

      FADE IN:

        (SEAN, LORNA)

      SEAN IS GETTING READY TO LEAVE.  THERE S A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.  
      HE OPENS IT TO LORNA.

                                  LORNA

                Sure, when you need something, the 

                door opens right away.

                                  SEAN

                Well, yeah.  (THEN)  Thanks for 

                watching Ellie.  She s in her room.  

                Mad at me.   

                                  LORNA

                Kids are tough.  You were a pain in 

                the ass.

                                  SEAN

                Thank you.

                                  LORNA

                A real pain in the ass. 

                                  SEAN

                I get it.

                                  LORNA

                Don t get me started.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1243.


                                  SEAN

                I m trying not to.

                                  LORNA

                So, why s Ellie mad?

      SEAN TAKES A BREATH, IS FORCED TO ADMIT:

                                  SEAN

                Because I don t know what I m doing!  

                She wanted to hang out with a boy 

                instead of having dinner.  Should I 

                have let her?  Maybe.  I didn t.  Was 

                that right?  I don t know.  And now 

                she knows I m in trouble with work.  

                Should I have told her?  I don t know.  

                Because what do I know about 

                  parenting?!  

                                  LORNA

                Nothing.  

                                  SEAN

                Exactly.  Oh, wait, that s not 

                helpful.

                                  LORNA

                None of us know anything.  It s all a 

                mess.  It has been forever.

                                  SEAN

                Still not helpful.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1244.


                                  LORNA

                All you can do is keep trying.  Stay 

                in it.  Don t let her push you away.

                                  SEAN

                Okay, that s a little helpful.  (THEN)  

                I m just scared I m going to blow it.  

                She s a good girl.  She deserves a 

                good dad.  

                                  LORNA

                She has a good dad.  

      SEAN TAKES THIS IN.  THEN, GRABBING HIS COAT;

                                  SEAN

                I gotta go.  I should be home soon.  

                If I m not back by midnight, I ve been 

                murdered with a golf club. 

                                  LORNA

                Then what?

                                  SEAN

                I don t know, mourn me?    

                                  LORNA

                What s that gonna do?

                                  SEAN

        (ELLIE, LORNA)

      ELLIE LIES ON HER BED PLAYING WITH HER IPHONE.  LORNA KNOCKS 
      AND ENTERS.

                                  LORNA

                Hello, dear.  Can I get you anything?

                                  ELLIE

                Hi, Grandma.  No, thanks.

      LORNA LOOKS AT HER A BEAT, THEN:  

                                  LORNA

                Your father s terrified.

                                  ELLIE

                Of losing his job?  I told him--

                                  LORNA

                No.  Not of losing his job.  

                                  ELLIE

                Is it because he s been watching that 

                zombie show?  Zombies freak him out, 

                he knew that going in.

      LORNA SMILES. 

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)

                Dammit, it has something to do with 

                me, right?

                                                                              CUT TO:            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1246.

        (SEAN, ELLIE, MAX)

      SEAN WALKS UP TO MAX S HOTEL ROOM DOOR.  HE STOPS AND 
      PRACTICES WHAT HE S GOING TO SAY.  

                                  SEAN

                 Sir, I was wrong.  I hope you ll 

                accept my apology and (PULLING IT OUT)  

                this twenty dollar coffee gift card.   

                Ugh, that barista was right.  Now 

                twenty doesn t seem like enough.        

      SEAN KNOCKS ON THE DOOR.  SUDDENLY, ELLIE APPEARS FROM AROUND 
      THE CORNER AND STANDS NEXT TO HIM.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)

                Ellie!  What are you doing?

                                  ELLIE

                You re in trouble because you wanted 

                to be with me.  Now I want to be with 

                you.    

                                  SEAN

                No, no, no.  I mean, that s sweet, 

                thank you, but go home. 

      ELLIE DOESN T MOVE.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)

                (RE: MAX)  You re not going to like 

                him.  He s very scary.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1247.


                                  ELLIE

                Like a zombie?

      SEAN SHUDDERS.

                                  SEAN

                Ew.  Hate zombies.  It s like all they 

                care about is eating people.  Give it 

                a break, have some juice or something.

      MAX OPENS THE DOOR, SURPRISED TO SEE ELLIE.  

                                  MAX

                Hey.  You brought your daughter?

                                  SEAN

                Yes.  She s interested in business.  

                So bringing her is completely normal.  

      AS SEAN AND ELLIE ENTER, WE:

        (SEAN, MAX, ELLIE)

      SEAN AND ELLIE ENTER.  THEY NOTICE A COCKATIEL SITTING ON THE 
      ARM OF A COUCH.  MAX SITS AND PUTS THE BIRD ON HIS SHOULDER.  
      HE OCCASIONALLY FEEDS IT SUNFLOWER SEEDS THROUGHOUT.      

                                  SEAN

                Oh, you have a cockatoo.

                                  MAX

                Tiel.  Cockatiel.  A cockatoo would be  

                five times Hector s size.  

                                  SEAN

                I don t know birds.  I knew it was a 

                bird.  Anyway, this is Ellie.  

                  (INTRODUCING)  Ellie, Max and Hector.

                                  ELLIE

                Hello, sir.  Bird.  

                                  MAX

                Hello, sweetheart.  Okay, Sean, why 

                don t you start with the best apology 

                you can muster, and let s see where 

                that takes us.  

      SEAN LOOKS AT MAX, THEN TO ELLIE, WHO WATCHES HIM 
        EXPECTANTLY.  HE TURNS BACK TO MAX.

                                  SEAN

                No.             Victor Fresco - 1/24/1249.


                                  MAX

                No? 

                                  SEAN

                (TO MAX)  Who are you to make me 

                choose between my job and my daughter?

                                  MAX

                Your boss.

                                  SEAN

                Okay.  True.  Still, I m not going to 

                  apologize for wanting to be with my 

                  daughter.  This girl is the center of 

                my universe.  And her world s been 

                turned upside down  (POINTEDLY, FOR 

                ELLIE)  whether she realizes that or 

                not.  And I m going to be there for 

                her  (FOR ELLIE)  whether she wants me 

                there or not.  So, I will be having 

                dinner with her.  (BACKING OFF)  For 

                now.  We ll see how things go, I m 

                always open to more dialogue.  

                (PULLING IT OUT)  And I got you a 

                coffee card.  The first of two. 

                                  MAX

                Sean, we all have families.  I don t.  

                But I can imagine.  The thing is, work 

                is important, and--

      SUDDENLY, ELLIE SPEAKS UP, DRAMATICALLY, STARTLING BOTH MAX 
      AND SEAN.            Victor Fresco - 1/24/1250.


                                  ELLIE

                My mom abandoned me!

                                  MAX

                What?

                                  SEAN

                (TO ELLIE)  What?

                                  ELLIE

                (TO MAX)  My mom.  She left.  She 

                moved away.  I didn t want to go, and 

                  I thought she wouldn t leave without 

                me.  But she did.  And that sucks.  

                She sucks.  And now all I have is my 

                dad, and we don t have the same 

                  shorthand, and who knows how it s 

                gonna work, but I need him.  (THEN)  

                And I d really also like him to keep 

                having a job, if possible.  And I love 

                birds.  I used to have one.  Louie.  

                Great guy.      

      MAX LOOKS AT HER A BEAT, THEN TO SEAN.

                                  MAX

                Hmm.  Clever bringing the girl.  

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

                         SCENE AA



        (SEAN, ELLIE)

      SEAN AND ELLIE HAVE JUST EXITED THE HOTEL ROOM.  SEAN CLOSES 
      THE DOOR BEHIND THEM, TURNS TO ELLIE.

                                  SEAN

                Oh, my God. 

                                  ELLIE

                What?  It worked.

                                  SEAN

                I knew you felt abandoned!

                                  ELLIE

                That was for his benefit.

                                  SEAN

                No, there s something there.   Your 

                mom sucks ?  That s real anger.  We 

                are so going to explore that.  

                                  ELLIE 

                We just did.  

      THEY START DOWN THE HALL.

                                  SEAN

                Not enough.

                                  ELLIE

                Then why don t we explore your stuff? 

                Grandma says you re terrified of me.              Victor Fresco - 1/24/1252.


                                  SEAN

                Not of you.  Of parenting, you Bozo.  

                                  ELLIE

                You re not supposed to call me names.

                                  SEAN

                See?  I don t know what I m doing!  

                                                                      CUT TO BLACK.
