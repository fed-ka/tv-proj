We open on a smart, casually dressed man selling perfume and jewellery
on a street corner. A crowd has gathered, attracted by the alarming
volume at which he is advertising his wares.
BACON
See these goods, they never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite, Fanny-
by-the-gas-light. If you can't see value here today you're not up here
shopping, you're up here shoplifting. Take a bag, take a bag. I took a
bag, I took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten
pounds I can tell ya. Tell me if I am going too cheap. Not ninety, not
eighty, not forty, half that and half that again, that's right, ten
pounds. Don't think 'cos it's sealed up it's an empty box. The only man
who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you
here today I would make more money with me measuring tape.
A well-dressed, zealous character (Eddy) appears from behind the crowd
waving money. It seems he can't wait to get rid of it.
EDDY
Bargain, that's a bloody bargain if I ever heard one. Ten pounds you
say? I'll have five.
Certainly sir. I'll just wrap.
Changing his attention.
BACON
Excuse me misses, sorry sir, ladies first and all that.
A tourist spectator, rather than a buyer, has been. put on the spot.
She fumbles through her bag hastily all too aware of the attention of
the crowd, of which she is now the focus. She passes her money like
it's contaminated. Others follow suit.
Buy 'em, you better buy 'em; they're not stolen, they just never been
paid for.
This really stokes the fire. The money can't come fast enough. Just as
business reaches its peak there is a call of alarm from the first
enthusiastic punter, who seems to be rather more familiar than he first
pretended.
EDDY
Bacon!
Bacon's expression changes dramatically. A series of crash zooms
between Ed's, Bacon's and a third party's eyes (the police) reveal
there is a problem. They're off: EDDY and BACON run like they have done
this before. They go down an ally; Ed jumps some stairs, we freeze.
BACON
(voice-over)
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's
fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
EDDY
(voice-over)
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the
police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big
boy now and it is time to move on.
We cut to a shot of Ed as he lands. He has made good distance.
Ed, Bacon, Soap and Tom park outside their house. As they get out they
pass Plank and John who have also just parked. They ignore each other,
and go to their separate doors.
Meet Big Chris and Little Chris (twelve years old).
BIG CHRIS
How long has he been in there, son?
LITTLE CHRIS
About twenty minutes.
BIG CHRIS
Is he on his own?
LITTLE CHRIS
Just carrying a bag.
BIG CHRIS
Let's have a look, shall we?
EDDY and the lads have all made an obvious effort with their
appearance. They are met by a doorman.
DOORMAN
Invitations.
EDDY
Invitations?
DOORMAN
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name
on it.
EDDY
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with
the Queen on it. Will that do?
DOORMAN
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
EDDY
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
DOORMAN
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I
do mean no one.
As the boys walk in to Samoan Jo's, a man comes tearing out of the door
covered in flames followed by his friends trying to put the flames out.
The lads look on in mild shock.
TOM
I heard this place was rough.
The Scousers make their way to the front door and unravel their lock-
picking kit. '

SAMOAN Jo's - NIGHT
SOAP
What sort of a pub is this then?
SAMOAN JO
A Samoan one. Anything else?
BACON
(receiving a monstrous, leafy cocktail)
What's that?
SAMOAN JO
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
BACON
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a
fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
SAMOAN JO
You want a pint, go to the pub.
BACON
I thought this was a pub.
SAMOAN JO
It's a Samoan pub.
BACON
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
SAMOAN JO
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
BACON looks at Rory Breaker, the man watching the TV.
BACON
Excuse me, could you turn the TV down?
RORY BREAKER
No.
He takes a swig of whatever he is drinking and frowns at Bacon. BACON
frowns back, then Soap interrupts.
SOAP
This is the English-Brazil game, isn't it?
Don is thrown out on to the street, screaming and cursing.
The Scousers, having now entered, make their way through the large
house.
DEAN
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
GARY
All right, Kenny.
Dean looks at Gary's disguise with some distaste. He has a stocking
pulled over only half his face. A sexy thigh grip is replicating an
artificial, frilly moustache, not giving the desired menacing look. A
big bouffant head of hair is neatly being conntrolled up on top.
DEAN
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
GARY
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.
(Lovingly rearranging his hair)
If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're
mistaken, Kenny.
Ed, who looks like he is close to suicide, has developed a two-day
stubble and his eyes have disappeared into black sockets. He stumbles
along the street with a bottle of scotch poking out of a pocket. He
stops outside JD's, looks at the entrance and decides not to go in.
60
DOG
(frustrated)
What the fuck is going on?
MICK
Do you want me to have a look, Dog?
DOG
No, you silly fucker, stay still.
(Whispering)
What's going on?
PLANK
Come on, I can't wait out here all day.
Starting to get anxious that the whole deal could be off Plank looks
down the stairs and waves at Dog as some kind of reassurance.
J
(off)
All right, just coming.
J unlocks the door after getting the cage ready. There's an external
door, and then a small corridor before the cage. J is inside the cage.
Two, or at a push, three people could fit in this space before they
would be poking out on the outside world.
DOG
Go! Go! Go! Fucking run, you two.
They all go charging into the open door only to slam straight into
Plank. The keys go flying out of Plank's hands and through the cage.
Plank cries with frustration, reaching out with his hand to retrieve
them. Dog, finding the gate locked, is none too happy They are also
still exposed to the eyes of the world due to the lack of space between
the outside door and the inside cage.
90 ~ 91
A traffic warden appears as Paul goes outside to load up.
TRAFFIC WARDEN
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will
move it for you.
PAUL
I'll only be a minute.
TRAFFIC WARDEN
You've already been fifteen.
Paul, realising that persuasion is futile, decides other means are
necessary to despatch this nuisance. He looks down both sides of the
street: the coast is clear.
PAUL
Look. Go on, look.
TRAFFIC WARDEN
At what, exactly?
PAUL
My van is half full.
TRAFFIC WARDEN
So?
PAUL
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
Having made their way to the rear of the van, Paul opens the back
doors. Paul smacks the traffic warden on the side of the head. The
momentum carries the warden into the van, unconscious. Paul has another
quick look round and Lifts the warden's legs up and pushes him deeper
into the vehicle.
BACON
Eh, bunk us up over the wall.
BACON forces one of the windows open. He looks pleased and beckons the
others over. They keep in contact with Soap by cellular phones.
TOM
They're here.
Paul enters, sees trouble, drops his bags and prepares to run. He is
met by Tom who greets him with a smash round the kneecaps with a lead
pipe. This has more than the desired effect and Paul has to be dragged
in screaming by Tom. It all went rather smoothly
EDDY
Tie 'em up, tape 'em up, face and mouth. Keys, I want the keys.
DOG
I'll find you.
BACON
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the
keys without any trouble.
EDDY
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Lenny and Nathan, Rory's minders, pull up outside the Sloanes' house to
have the weed analysed. For the first time it is revealed that Rory
Breaker owns the Sloanes.
LENNY
Hold on!
NATHAN
What?
LENNY
something's not quite right here. Go in slowly, Nathan.
NATHAN
Fuck you funny man, you go first.
After a while Ed sees Daisy making a sneaky sharp exit and tries to
pursue her, running out on to the street. Daisy is nowhere to be seen.
115
Big Chris and Little Chris are waiting outside. Dog's gang are waiting
for Ed's gang inside. Rory's gang are going to Ed's.
122
Rory's boys stop the van outside Ed's and back up to Ed's front door.
The rear van door is opened when it is completely flush and Lenny (with
gun) prepares to do his worst.
We see the windows shattering from the outside as bullets hail through.
Big Chris, watching the house, intrigued and interested by all the
activity, has made his way closer, and low and behold: looks what walks
straight into him.
BIG CHRIS
Got something here for me, have ya?
(Dog is stunned by this)
Come on, chop chop.
Before Dog has a chance to use the shotguns Chris grabs one in each
hand and knocks Dog down with a swift headbutt. Dog moans, not knowing
what day of the week it is. Chris opens the case, sees it's full of
money, takes the two shotguns, then leaves. Thank you very much.
On reaching the car he gives the case to his son, putting the guns on
the back seat.
Count that son, and put your seatbelt on.
BACON
What has been going on here?
They look into a smoking, blood-covered house.
SOAP
The money, the gear!
TOM
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been
swapped for a pile of corpses.
SOAP
OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
EDDY
Bollocks! You can think about it for as long as you like. I am
panicking and I am off mate.
The Scousers watch Big Chris walk out of Hatchet's empty-handed
DEAN
We gotta get those guns.
GARY
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
DEAN
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be
preferable to death by Hatchet.
GARY
Furry muff, let's go.
SOAP
I hope this is the right move.
EDDY
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am
going to call him.
BACON
As if he'll care.
130
EDDY
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares
about us is different. Pass your phone.
BACON
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
EDDY
You and me, Tom.
TOM
What do you mean, me?
They stand outside Hatchet's door and are just about to ring it when
Tom notices it's open.
BIG CHRIS
A job well done son; we made a few quid out of that one.
As he puts the key in the ignition, there is no reply from his little
boy
BIG CHRIS
Son?
DOG
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
We can't see Dog but we can see the sharp side of a knife resting along
the front of Little Chris's throat. The Dog is Lying down in the back.
Big Chris assesses the situation.
BIG CHRIS
You all right back there, mate?
DOG
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
BIG CHRIS
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
DOG
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want
to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
BIG CHRIS
All right, furry muff.
Big Chris doesn't seem too bothered by this problem. He shrugs and
starts the car.
DOG
What are you doing?
BIG CHRIS
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
DOG
You had better be careful.
Big Chris starts his car up, looks across to make sure that Little
Chris has got his seatbelt on and pulls out on to the road. He gets
faster and faster until Dog pokes him in the shoulder with his knife.
Chris pulls hard to the left and rams into the nearest parked vehicle.
BANG' Dog goes flying forward, hitting the windscreen.
Big Chris walks out into the street. We see a shiny new sports car.
Little Chris is sitting in the passenger seat.
BIG CHRIS
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money-
loaning business, all right, son?
LITTLE CHRIS
All right, Dad.
BIG CHRIS
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
