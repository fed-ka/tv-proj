      She is perched awkwardly on the back seat.  Next to her are a 
      YOUNG COUPLE.  They wear the minimum of clothes and are snogging 
      one another with frenzied abandon, unashamed of their mutual 


      Cut between LOLA in the heat, glancing at them and her POV: the 
      BOY'S hand on the GIRL'S thigh.  Sweat on skin.  Open mouths.  


        DUDLEY arrives, shambling awkwardly down the aisle, clutching 




                                    DUDLEY 
                      Sorry love.  It's chaos out there.

                      Thanks. 

      The SNOGGING COUPLE ratchet the action up a notch. Sweating, 


                                    DUDLEY 
                      Ooh it's baking.       The SNOGGING MAN has his hand in his girlfriends top.  He is 
        rolling her nipple between his fingers. 

                                    DUDLEY 
                      Does that window work? 

                                    LOLA 
                      It's stuck. 

      The SNOGGING MAN'S eyes flick briefly over LOLA.  DUDLEY opens 


                                    DUDLEY 
                      Did I lock the front door?  Or did you? 

                                    LOLA 
                      You. 

        DUDLEY pats his pockets.  

                                    DUDLEY 
                      Are you sure? 

                                    LOLA 
                      Yeah.

                      I can't find the key. 

                                    LOLA 
                      You gave it to me.

                      I didn't. 

                                    LOLA 
                      You did. 

      We hear a low moan.  A BARE ARM swings loosely over DUDLEY'S 


                                    DUDLEY 
                      Have a look in your bag. 

      LOLA does so reluctantly.  She holds up the key. A deep groan         DUDLEY offers LOLA a sweet. 

                                    DUDLEY 
                      Polo? 

      LOLA smiles weakly and takes it. 

      The COACH judders into life and rolls off.

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      What?

                      I'm ready. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Great.  Get that money and don't fuck 
                      about.  No gabbing with your mates.  No 
                      freebies off the girls.  No rolling up

                      Do you want some chips? 

        SHIRLEY conceals his irritation. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      No I don't want any fucking chips.  
                      Just get in there.  Show some front.                        Get out.  You can do it.  I know you

                      Good.  I hope it dies. 

        SHIRLEY turns the page and is shocked by what he sees.  

        SHIRLEY'S POV of the paper: an article about the tenth 
        anniversary of Sins Nightclub.  There are photographs of SHIRLEY 
      and his wife CONNIE - a brassy, confident woman in her early 
        forties.  A caption reads 'Connie Woolf dazzles crowd at 


        Amongst these are 'Heat'-style unflattering photos of CONNIE: 
      on a bar stool holding up a glass of champagne and flashing her 
        knickers; close-up of cellulite; her face emphasizing a spot on

                      Take my car.  Get that cash.    

        SHIRLEY lowers his paper. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      And Liam. 

        Pause. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Stay away from Mercy.

        DUDLEY and LOLA are pressed together leaning against the window.

                      Did I do well? 

      LOLA gives him a peck. 

                                    LOLA 
                      You did brilliant. 

      She peers back out of the window.   

        DUDLEY watches her.  The sunlight on the little blond hairs of 


      LOLA takes in the glitter of the seafront and beyond that the 
      grey expanse of the Irish Sea.  Suddenly she sees the nude figure       For a fleeting moment, their eyes meet, then the coach speeds

      The doors crash open.  LIAM strides in messily eating a bag of 


        Shelves lined with rock, seaside souvenirs, postcards, buckets 
      and spades, but also crude and vulgar novelty items - 
        penis-shaped lollies, plastic breasts and turds.  Display 


      LIAM swaggers towards the cash desk.  In the background are a 
        couple of nine year old KIDS looking round the shop.   

        Behind the cash register is a middle aged woman PATTI.  She flicks                                     LIAM 
                      Alright doll... 

      PATTI doesn't respond.  She turns a page in her brochure.  LIAM 
        momentarily hesitates, then launches into his patter. 

                                    LIAM 
                      No excuses.  No fairytales.  Get busy 


        Slowly PATTI looks up.  She takes LIAM in, clearly unimpressed.   

      The KIDS push in front of LIAM to the counter.  They lay down 
        a handful of penny chews, some Chomp Bars and a lethal looking 


      PATTI turns wearily to the back of the shop.

      IDI the storeowner stands stroking a lively-looking tabby tomcat.  
      He is struggling to keep it in his arms.   

      The shelves behind IDI are lined with colourful novelty wigs.  
      The Racing Post is open on a stool, next to an old transistor

                      To the untrained eye.

      IDI lifts one of the cat's paws. 

                                    IDI 
                      As limp as a cripple's dick. 

      LIAM is looking at his phone's display.  It's a photo-message 
      of a glorious-looking Fender Stratocaster.  IDI catches sight

                      What is matter with you?  Still in 
                      thrall to that man.  I thought you were 
                      going to be something.  Big star.  Mad 


                                    LIAM 
                      I am.  I've got things cooking.

                      You know who I had in the shop last 


        A beat for effect.

      LIAM scrolls down the picture on his phone to reveal the message:

                      Take the cat as collateral.  I'll fix 


      LIAM hesitates.  He looks at the cat.

        A faint wailing begins from upstairs, Grace-Pool-like. 

      They look towards the source of the sound. 

      BANG! The double doors behind the reception area are thrown open.  
        Filling them is the lanky figure of LEO FINCH - late forties,

      The word falls like a lead weight in the silence.   

                                    DUDLEY 
                            (awkward beat) 
                      This weekend...Anything goes.  I'll 
                      do whatever you want.  Your wildest 


      LOLA struggles for a moment.  She would like to speak but she 


                                    DUDLEY 
                      Just give me a hint. 

                                    LOLA 
                            (hesitant) 
                      I'll try 

      She approaches DUDLEY and gives him a peck.  DUDLEY pulls her 
        towards him.  She puts her arms around him.  They hug.  DUDLEY'S 
      hands stray towards her buttocks.  They rest there for a moment.  


                                    DUDLEY 
                      Well...no time like the present. 

      An excruciating pause. 

                                    LOLA 
                      I'll just have a wee.       LOLA enters the bathroom and shuts the door.  DUDLEY hurriedly 


                                                                              CUT TO: 



      LOLA is perched on the toilet, looking round the grim bathroom 


      She leans forward to look at an intriguing figurine on the 
        bathroom window.  It is a naked women in lewd pose.  There is 


      She leans further forward to peer at it.  The inscription reads 
        "'There are few nudities so objectionable as the naked truth' 


        Suddenly the panel next to the toilet bursts open revealing 
        itself to be a door - another entrance into the bathroom.  LEO 


                                    LEO 
                      Just advising you about this door.  
                      Anyone could come through it if you're 


      He barely registers the fact that LOLA is on the toilet.  He 


                                    LEO 
                      That bath's got jets.     

      LEO winks at her.  And with that he is gone.  LOLA's mouth is

        DUDLEY is sat up in bed bare chested, nervously awaiting her.  




                                    LOLA 
                      Let's go out.                                                                               CUT TO: 



      Three playing cards lain out face down on a shop counter.   

        CARTER KRANTZ stands on one side of the counter, now wearing a 
        sixties Michael Caine-style Alfie suit, a price tag still 


      Two old Blackpool ladies ALICE and DOREEN are on the other side 


                                    ALICE 
                      That one...or that one...no...oh I 


                                    DOREEN 
                      Are you sure these aren't trick cards. 

                                    CARTER 
                      Your cards ladies.  I'm just a quick         CARTER glances out of the window.  CHRIS CHURCH is approaching 


                                    ALICE 
                      Ooo 'ant he got lovely eyes.  Bedroom 


                                    DOREEN 
                      You want to watch her. 

        DOREEN reaches out and touches one of the cards.  CARTER smiles 
        devilishly and turns it over revealing a three of clubs.  He turns 


                                    DOREEN 
                      That's another fiver.  He's cleaned me 


                                    ALICE 
                      You'll have to dip in' till. 

        CARTER shakes his head.   

                                    CARTER 
                      No.  You're alright.  What I want is 


                                    ALICE 
                      Ah well...you're in right place.  She 
                      knows everything... 
                        Illnesses...affairs...who all the 


        DOREEN nods proudly.  The shop bell goes and CHRIS CHURCH - a 


                                    CHRIS CHURCH 
                      Afternoon ladies.  I'm looking for a 
                      nudist.  Someone's been flashing 
                      their all on the front.  He was seen 


        CARTER gives them a conspiratorial wink. 

                                    DOREEN 
                      Oh no... 

                                    ALICE 
                      We should be so lucky.       They giggle.  CHRIS CHURCH looks down at CARTER'S feet.  CARTER 


                                    CHRIS CHURCH 
                      And can I ask you sir...where were you 


                                    CARTER 
                      I was outside. 

        CARTER holds CHRIS'S gaze. 

                                    CARTER 
                      On the front. 

      CHRIS studies CARTER warily. 

                                    CHRIS CHURCH 
                      Were you fully clothed at this time 


        CARTER holds his gaze. 

                                    CARTER 
                      No. 

                                    CHRIS CHURCH 
                      I see. 

                                    CARTER 
                      I was barefoot. 

                                    CHRIS CHURCH 
                      What about the rest of you...was that 


        CARTER hesitates and glances at the old ladies. 

                                    CARTER 
                      No. 

                                    CHRIS 
                      And how do I know you're telling me the 


                                    CARTER 
                      I've got impetigo. 

                                    CHRIS                       What? 

                                    CARTER 
                      Impetigo.  It's a skin condition.  I'm 
                      covered in it.  From here to here... 

        CARTER gestures from his chest to his feet. 

                                    CARTER 
                      Red raw.  Scabs.  Under my arms.  Arse 
                      crack.  All over my balls.  Have a look 


      CHRIS studies him. 

                                    CARTER 
                      Ask my aunt.  She'll tell you. 

        CARTER looks back at ALICE and winks. 

                                    ALICE 
                      It's true officer.  He's had a

                      Poor lamb. 

        CHRIS'S radio crackles. 

                                    RADIO 
                      727.  Are you available to go to

                                    CHRIS 
                      Right.  Ok.  Well if you hear 


      He leaves, a little embarrassed responding to his radio.  

                                    DOREEN 
                      Are you in trouble? 

                                    ALICE 
                      You're not going to tie us up and have 


        CARTER looks at them cooly.                                     CARTER  
                      I'm looking for someone. 

        A pause.   

                                    CARTER 
                      A friend.     

        CARTER holds out his piece of paper.  

                                    CARTER 
                      Ambrose Chapel. 

        DOREEN and ALICE look at each other - a little shocked. 

                                    CARTER 
                      You know him? 

      ALICE reaches for a copy of the BLACKPOOL MERCURY resting on the

      top barely concealing her prominent bosom and a tight 




      In her hand is a copy of the Blackpool Mercury open at the piece 


      She turns a corner almost knocking over a BARMAN carrying a crate 


      She thrusts open a door and struts in.

      Cheap pine panelling, like a 5-dollar sauna.  No windows.  


      With one hand RUBY WOOLF is painting her toe-nails gold.  With 
      her other she is flicking through the photos on her mobile phone.

                      Fucking little fuck of a fucking shit 


      RUBY and SHIRLEY exchange a look. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                          (to CONNIE) 
                      Look.  Calm down. 

                                    CONNIE 
                      Calm down - ?                                      SHIRLEY 
                      It means nothing. 

                                    CONNIE 
                      It's not your fanny spread across the 
                      centre pages.  Every crease and spot 


                                    SHIRLEY 
                      I'll find out who did it.  I'll crucify 


                                    CONNIE 
                      You know who did it.  I've been 
                      humiliated and you don't fucking 


        SHIRLEY comes up behind her, tender and placatory. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Of course I care.   

                                    CONNIE 
                      Then what are you going to do about it? 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      I told you. I'll sort it out. 

                                    CONNIE 
                      Yada yada yada. I've heard it all 


        CONNIE refuses to soften, turns and sits down at her desk, still 


      RUBY holds up her phone for CONNIE and SHIRLEY to see.  A photo 
      of CHRIS CHURCH grinning inanely at the lens. 

                                    RUBY 
                      What do you think? 

        CONNIE starts to go through her paperwork. 

                                    RUBY 
                      He's called Chris.  He's taking me to 


                                    CONNIE 
                      Not tonight he's not.  We need you.         CONNIE furiously impales invoices on a spike.  

        SHIRLEY moves behind CONNIE and starts to kiss her neck.   At 
      first CONNIE resists but then she seems to soften. 



                                    RUBY 
                              (protesting) 
                      Ahhh!  It's my night off. 

                                    CONNIE 
                      We're too busy.   Your dad's playing 
                      poker.  I'll be in the VIP lounge.  


      One of the ALSATIONS starts licking the polish off RUBY'S toes 


                                    RUBY 
                      Dad... tell her ... 

        SHIRLEY tries to lighten the atmosphere. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Get the lad to come here.  

 
                      Introduce him to the Dingles. 

                                    RUBY 
                      But I think he's going to propose. 

                                    CONNIE 
                      Fifth one this year. 

                                    RUBY 
                      He's bought me a ring.  I found a 
                      receipt.   I was going through his 


                                    CONNIE 
                      Well that's very touching.  But you're 


                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Your mum needs you here.         Sulkily, and half-unconsciously, RUBY grabs a half-eaten 
        doughnut out of one of the dog's mouths and starts munching on 


                                    RUBY 
                      My mum's dead. 

                                    CONNIE 
                      Old news love. 

        CONNIE resumes her paperwork.  LIAM enters holding IDI'S

                      Alright. 

      They all look at him. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      What the fuck's that? 

                                    LIAM 
                      It's Idi's.  He's skint.  He's given

                                    LIAM 
                      Collateral.  You know ... if he 


        SHIRLEY stares at him.

                      You can keep it. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      I don't want it.  What I wanted was a 


                                    LIAM 
                      Relax.  Chill.  You'll have the 


      LIAM hands the cat to SHIRLEY.  SHIRLEY slaps it out of LIAM'S 
        hands.  The animal flies across the room and lands on CONNIE'S                                     CONNIE 
                      Jesus Shirley! 

      She looks down at her cream-coloured skirt. 

                                    CONNIE 
                      I've just had this dry-cleaned. 

      RUBY prods at the limp form of the cat with an emery board.  LIAM 


                                    LIAM 
                      You've killed it! 

        SHIRLEY stares at LIAM. 

                                    LIAM 
                      What am I going to tell Idi? 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      To pay up.  You fucking fat little 


                                    LIAM 
                      No. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      You what? 

                                    LIAM 
                      I'm not going.  I'm striking out on my 


      LIAM hesitates. 

                                    LIAM 
                      I'm going to manage a band. 

      RUBY starts to laugh. 

                                    LIAM 
                      I mean it.  I've got talent. I can take 


                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Oh yeah? And who's going to back you? 

      LIAM whacks down a big envelope of money on the desk.                                     LIAM 
                      Mercy... 

      RUBY stops laughing.  CONNIE stares at the money.  SHIRLEY stares 


                                                                              CUT TO: 



        CARTER KRANTZ makes his way cautiously down a gloomy corridor.  
        A strip light above him flickers on and off. 

      He pauses in front of an exhibit.  A LARGE COCKEREL dressed as 
      Jerry Lee Lewis.  It has been posed before a model piano, with 
      one claw perched on the keyboard.  A peeling dynalabel reads 


        CARTER walks on. The sound of a drill begins, maybe from the next 
        building.  CARTER starts at it.  He flicks a nervous glance over 


        Another exhibit: draped in flamboyantly silky fabric, with a 
        backcombed frightwig - a LARGE DUCK.  The label reads: 'A Bird 


      And then the third.  A HUGE BLACK OWL, draped in cheap bling, 
      with a white headband and a white vest.  The label reads 'Gangster 


      In the bottom right hand corner of each case is a yellowed piece 
      of paper carrying the extravagant signature of Ambrose Chapfel. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                            (OOV) 
                      We're closing.  The gallery will 


        CARTER jumps. 

        AMBROSE CHAPFEL appears.  Late thirties - immaculately dressed 
      in a neat smock, from which peeks a naval sweater and paisley 
        cravat.  He is beanpole thin, with sculpted white blond hair and 


                                    CARTER 
                      Sign says open.         CARTER doesn't move. He peers at the Gangster Raptor exhibit. 

                                    CARTER 
                      Very impressive. Looks like it's 


                                    AMBROSE 
                      Thank you. Now if you don't mind. 

                                    CARTER 
                      I'm a collector myself.  Nothing like 
                      this though. It's like the fucking 


                                    AMBROSE 
                      It's all my own work. I have won awards. 


                                    CARTER 
                      I'm looking for somone. Ambrose 


        AMBROSE looks at CARTER, spots the newspaper under his arm. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      I am innocent of those charges.  When 
                      will you people leave me alone.  A 
                      simple taxidermist trying to practise 


        CARTER looks past him.  The door behind AMBROSE is opened a touch.  
        A glimpse of a monstrous creation -  a calf's body with a poodle's 


                                    CARTER 
                      You're Ambrose? 

                                    AMBROSE 
                            (put out) 
                      Yes...I am known. 

      He gestures to a faded cutting in a frame - a photo of ROLF HARRIS 
        kneeling down, several people huddled round, AMBROSE stands 


        CARTER turns slowly and studies AMBROSE. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      Who are you?  What do you want?         CARTER takes a step towards him. 

                                    CARTER 
                      You don't recognise me? 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      No...should I? 

                                    CARTER 
                      I'm from London. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      London... 

        AMBROSE thinks for a moment.  Something flickers across his face. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      I haven't been to London for years.  I 


        CARTER stares at him, trying to weigh up his words. 

                                    CARTER 
                      Yeah. 

        AMBROSE flushes. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      It was only that one time. 

        Flustered, AMBROSE walks off down the corridor. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                            (blushing) 
                      I have to close up. It's getting 


                                    CARTER 
                      I want to talk to you. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      I...don't know...I'm terribly 
                      busy...my creation...I have to finish 


        AMBROSE is at the master light switches - a jerry-built box 
        covered in switches and masking tape.           CARTER stands uncomfortably close to him.  The sound of drilling, 


                                    CARTER 
                      How about a drink? 

        AMBROSE hesitates. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      Maybe later. 

        CARTER looks him in the eye. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      Where are you staying? 

                                    CARTER 
                      Nowhere. Hotel's full. Can't get a 


                                    AMBROSE 
                            (uncertainly) 
                      You look tired. 

                                    CARTER 
                      Yeah.  I haven't slept a wink. 

        Another beat. 

                                    CARTER 
                      I had a really bad night. 

        CARTER studies AMBROSE for a response. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                            (tremulously) 
                      Perhaps you should rest.  I've a room 


        AMBROSE'S hand hovers a big switch labelled 'Open/Closed'.   

                                    CARTER 
                      Perfect. 

        CARTER reaches across, their faces almost touching. A loud click 



      They separate and begin to survey the various items on the 
        display.  A massive range of rock.  Pick 'n' mix.  Postcards.  
        DUDLEY chances stealing a penny chew from the pick and mix.  LOLA 


      She picks up a plastic bum and holds it up to her face.  DUDLEY 
        laughs.  She puts the bum down.  They continue to explore the 


      The sound of a distant roll of thunder. 

        DUDLEY finds a unit full of novelty rock.  Amongst the more 
        innocuous items there are pink sugar lollies shaped like penises.  


                                    DUDLEY 
                      See anything you like? 

      LOLA jumps a little, she seems a touch flustered. 

                                    LOLA 
                      Not really. 

        DUDLEY looks up to see what LOLA was looking at so intently: a 
        garish box with the words "What she wants" stamped across it.  
      The see-through panel reveals a massive ultra-realistic black 


                                    LOLA 
                            (embarrassed) 
                      I'm going to pay for this.  

                                    DUDLEY 
                      Is that all you want? 

      She walks to the counter, postcards in hand.   



                                    DUDLEY 
                      Anything you want you can have it.   

                                    LOLA 
                      I'm fine with these.         She holds up three traditional saucy postcards.   

                                    LOLA 
                      Three for a pound. 

      She starts to pay PATTI for the cards.   

        DUDLEY looks back at the dildo in the box, perturbed.   

                                                                              CUT TO: 


        splashes water on his face.  He stares into his own eyes, haggard, 


      He takes in the key around his neck, notices the blood on the 


      He glances around the bathroom - cramped, ancient and Victorian, 


      He takes in a shelf upon which there is an old-fashioned powdered 
        toothpaste and a pink Phillips Ladyshave. 

                                                                              CUT TO: 



        CARTER'S POV: The back of AMBROSE'S head and shoulders walking 
      ahead of him down a dingy upstairs landing.  Floorboards creaking 


        CARTER glances through an open door as he passes.  Piled-up boxes 


                                    AMBROSE 
                      I live alone here.  Quite alone. 

                                                                              CUT TO: 



        A bare bulb flicks on revealing a spartan bedroom with a single 
      bed with a chocolate covered blanket bang in the middle of the 
      room.  AMBROSE and CARTER stand in the doorway. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      You may rest here. 

        CARTER studies AMBROSE. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                            (slightly panicked) 
                      I must finish my exhibit...excuse me. 

        AMBROSE leaves, shutting the door behind him.         CARTER waits for a second listening to the receding footsteps, 
      then with a sudden urgency he starts to look around. 

        CARTER opens the wardrobe in the corner of the room.  Inside are 


      He goes to a chest of drawers.  He opens one drawer.  There is 
        a single pair of turquoise underpants.  He opens another and 
      finds a single dog lead attached to an empty collar.   

        Frustrated, CARTER looks around the room then slumps down on 


                                                                              CUT TO: 



        SHIRLEY pushes through the CROWD still followed by LIAM. 

      Close on a pair of bare girl's feet, her toe-nails are painted 
        immaculately with sparkly green nail-polish. 

        Reveal VIENNA KEEN - the fawn-like beauty already glimpsed on 


                                    VIENNA

                      Hiyah chuck.   

      LIAM too nervous to respond, smiles weakly. SHIRLEY is scanning 


                                    VIENNA 
                      Mr Woolf?   

      He flicks his eyes over Vienna. 

                                    VIENNA 
                      They dealing you in tonight?   

                                    SHIRLEY                       What's it to you? 

        SHIRLEY is wary - all too aware of her near-nakedness.  VIENNA 


                                    VIENNA 
                      I like to watch.  Remember? 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Where's Mercy? 

        Suddenly a chirpy obsequious-seeming Chinese man - BRYAN appears 


                                    BRYAN 
                      Mr Shirley.  You are very very welcome.  


                                    SHIRLEY 
                      No I don't want a fucking table.  I 


      BRYAN glances around awkwardly. 

                                    BRYAN 
                      I have not seen Mercy for some days I 


      But SHIRLEY is already striding through the room, scanning the 
        tables.  BRYAN follows trying to distract him. 

                                    BRYAN 
                      You want free drink? You want Vienna 
                      do dance for you? One to one, on house. 


        SHIRLEY ignores BRYAN and walks on.  At the back of the room, 
        stands the huge, bear-like shaven-headed figure of THE GREEK. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Oi.  Oddbod. 

      The FIGURE turns. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Where's Mercy? 

                                    MERCY 
                            (OOV)                       I'm right here. 

        SHIRLEY turns to see a 62 year old blonde.  Though her face is 
      lined and wrinkled her lips are rouged.  She smokes a cigarillo.  
      She wears the clothes of a much younger woman.  She studies 


                                                                              CUT TO:

                                    FRANNY KRANTZ 
                      Take it to the beach.  Throw it in the 


      The ELDERLY WOMAN vomits a quantity of blood.

                      Don't let them have it... 



        A power-drill punches through a wooden door. 

        A frightened CARTER clambering out of a narrow window. 

        CARTER'S POV looking back: a distant silhouette in a window 


        A close-up of the rusty key in CARTER'S bloodied hand.  

                                                                              CUT TO: 


        sweating, manically reaches for his key, then freezes.    

        Standing over the bed is the emaciated wraith-like figure of 


                                    AMBROSE 
                      Forgive me.  It's been a long time. 

        AMBROSE sits on the bed.  CARTER stares at him, doesn't move an 


                                    AMBROSE 
                      I'm a little out of practice.   

      An uncomfortable pause. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                              (hesitantly) 
                      You have beautiful bones.  I know 


        Uncertainly AMBROSE places his hand - a dead weight - over 


                                    AMBROSE 
                      I'm sorry...I have only done this 
                      once...you know him of course...he 
                      was a big man...a builder...a Gooner. 

        Ineptly, AMBROSE attempts a seductive stroke of CARTER'S hand. 

                                    CARTER 
                      A Gooner? 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      He supported the Arsenal. 

        CARTER puts his hand over AMBROSE'S.  It seems a gentle gesture.  
        AMBROSE responds - 15 years of celibacy about to be washed away.   

      But CARTER'S grip tightens a little too hard. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                            (uneasily) 
                      You prefer the Spurs? 

        CARTER'S hand tightens even more.                                     AMBROSE 
                        You're...hurting me. 

      Fear flickers in AMBROSE'S eyes. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      This is not what I like...if Bruno 


                                    CARTER 
                      Who's Bruno? A fucking bear? I've 


                                    AMBROSE 
                      But...you said... 

                                    CARTER 
                      That's not why I'm here. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                            (horrified) 
                      Then who are you..? 

        CARTER stands.  He is now crushing AMBROSE'S hand.  AMBROSE is 


                                    CARTER 
                      Think back. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      I don't know...Bruno...I thought he'd 


                                    CARTER 
                      Franny. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      Fanny? 

                                    CARTER 
                      Franny!  Francis Krantz. 

        CARTER squeezes mercilessly. 

                                    CARTER 
                      My mother... 

                                    AMBROSE                       I don't know her...I never touched 


                                    CARTER 
                      ...last night...she gave me your 


                                    AMBROSE 
                            (horrified) 
                      No! 

        CARTER flicks open the piece of paper and shoves it in AMBROSE'S 


                                    CARTER 
                      Ambrose Chapel. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      No Chapfel. 


                      Chapel. 

                                    AMBROSE 
                      Chapfel!  Chapfel!  My name is Ambrose 
                      Chapfel! 

        AMBROSE points out a framed promotional photograph on the wall 
      of AMBROSE in his evening suit - with some of his creations.  A 




                                    AMBROSE 
                      I don't know this women.  I'm just an 


      This too sinks in.  A seemingly endless pause where CARTER just 


                                    AMBROSE 
                      You have the wrong man. 

                                                                              CUT TO: 




        A moment, then they begin to undress rapidly, awkwardly, both 


                                                                              CUT TO: 



      CLOSE ON: a black and white monitor showing VIENNA KEEN gyrating 


        A huge, empty breeze-block office.  Opposite the door is a    a 
        massive metal desk with no chair.  Four bright-orange plastic 
        primary school chairs.  To one side a red-velvet chaise-longue.   

      The rest of the space trails off into darkness. Faintly visible 
      on the far wall is a large close-up photograph of a shark, it's 


      MERCY is wheeled in by THE GREEK, followed by SHIRLEY and a 


                                    MERCY 
                      Take a seat Shirley. 

      MERCY indicates one of the orange chairs. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      I'll stand.    

      MERCY looks at LIAM and pats the Chaise-Longue.  LIAM moves to 
      sit.  SHIRLEY looks at him.  LIAM doesn't know what to do.  For 
        a moment he half sits/half stands - then decides to remain 


                                    MERCY 
                      So what's the problem? 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      My son needs money.  I'm the one that 


                                    LIAM 
                      Look, I can - 

                                    SHIRLEY                       Shut up. 

                                    LIAM 
                      Nan was just trying -  

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Will you shut the fuck up! 

                                    MERCY 
                      The boy's got talent.  You can't deny 


      MERCY gestures to two large portrait photographs rendered as 
        oil-paintings.  The first is of a rotund rosy-faced blond - Big 
      Soph.  The second a leather cat-suited svelte brunette singer 
        caught dramatically mid-song. This is Lena -Liam and Ruby's 


                                    MERCY 
                      I'm just trying to help. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Like before.  Like Manchester.  Three 
                      months off his head.  Every shark in 
                      Rusholme taking a bite.  He doesn't 


        A moment of silence.  MERCY produces a roll of money like a loaf 


                                    MERCY 
                      Why don't you go and get yourself a 


                                    LIAM 
                      Smart - 

        SHIRLEY grabs LIAM'S wrist before he can take the money. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Wait in the car. 

      LIAM looks nervously at SHIRLEY.  SHIRLEY'S eyes are fixed on 
        MERCY.  LIAM exits.  MERCY gives THE GREEK a nod.  He leaves too, 


                                    SHIRLEY 
                      What you playing at?       MERCY wheels herself closer towards SHIRLEY. 

                                    MERCY 
                      I'm disappointed Shirley. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      You're disappointed? 

      MERCY forcefully pulls a drawer open in the desk.  She removes 
        a large, hand-made birthday card, covered in lace and net.  In 
      the centre is a heart-shaped photo of WILLY WOOLF and his donkey 


                                    MERCY 
                      Your brother's. 

      She reaches into the drawer and withdraws a cheap little corner 
      shop birthday card tailored for an elderly woman.   

                                    MERCY 
                      Yours... 

        SHIRLEY is taken aback. 

                                    MERCY 
                      Your wife's handwriting...not even a 


        A pause while SHIRLEY takes this in. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Pay back. 

        SHIRLEY throws down the newspaper open at the article about Sins. 

                                    MERCY 
                      How's the therapy?  Any progress? 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      We're not going.  And I wonder why. 

                                    MERCY 
                      I did you a favour.  You're not the 


                                    SHIRLEY 
                      I love my wife.  

                                    MERCY                       And all those little pretties out 


        SHIRLEY momentarily glances at VIENNA on the monitor. 

                                    MERCY 
                      Such a waste. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Mug's game. 

        SHIRLEY turns and walks towards the door. 

                                    MERCY 
                      You know she's been a naughty girl.  


        SHIRLEY stops and looks at her. 

                                    MERCY 
                      She's got a buyer for the club. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Forget it. 

                                    MERCY 
                      She was in Todmorden Tuesday.  Agreed 


        SHIRLEY's shaken, covers. 

                                    MERCY 
                      She wants you out of Blackpool.   
                            (mocking) 
                      She wants you all to herself. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      We had an agreement. You went back on 


      MERCY starts to wheel herself slowly towards SHIRLEY. 

                                    MERCY 
                      I'm your mother.  I want your 


                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Leave it.                                     MERCY 
                      You made promises.  Once it was Sunday 
                      lunch every week...a carvery or a fish 
                      restaurant.  Then it was monthly...a 
                      round of mini-golf or a run up to 
                        Bispham...now it's the Trafford 
                      Centre, Bank Holiday Monday.  That's 


      MERCY lays a hand over SHIRLEY'S.  He withdraws his. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      ...I've been busy. 

      MERCY swivels her wheelchair towards him. 

                                    MERCY 
                      Oh yes.  Doing what? Licking that 


      MERCY throws open another drawer. 

                                    MERCY 
                      You think you're a big man, you're 


      She withdraws an ancient pair of crumpled child's Y-fronts.  
        Visible is a sewn in name tag reading 'Shirley Woolf'. 

                                    MERCY 
                      Ten years old.  Shitting yourself. 

        A pause.  MERCY taps her lips. 

                                    MERCY 
                      Make amends. 

        SHIRLEY stares at her.  And then with a trembling hand he puts 


                                    SHIRLEY 
                      That's all you're going to get from 


      MERCY puts hand on SHIRLEY'S. 

                                    MERCY 
                      Don't be so sure.       He turns to the door and walks out.  MERCY stares after him.   

      She picks up the card - takes a long drag on her cigarillo and 
      then brings the burning end towards the kiss on the card, burning 


                                                                              CUT TO: 



        DUDLEY and LOLA are in bed.  DUDLEY clumsily thrusting his 
        fingers in and out in between LOLA'S legs. 

        DUDLEY'S face wears an exaggerated theatrical rictus of pleasure.  


                                    DUDLEY 
                      Does that feel good? 

                                    LOLA 
                            (uncertainly) 
                      Hmmm! 

                                    DUDLEY 
                      You like that don't you... 

                                    LOLA 
                      Yes...

      He swings clumsily on top of Lola, entering her. 

                                    DUDLEY 
                        ...yeah...yeah...ride it... 

      In the process he jolts her head painfully into the head-board.

                      Sorry love.

                      I'm fine...carry on.       He begins to thrust with absurd vigour and enthusiasm. 

                                    DUDLEY

      There is no perceptible change in his stroke.  However in 
        DUDLEY'S frenzy his foot slips off the bed and gets caught in 
      the orange plastic bucket.  He tries to shake it off, slowing 
      his rhythm.  Inadvertently this action pleases LOLA. 

                                    LOLA 
                      That's it. 

      He continues to try and shake it off.

                      That's better...that's good. 

        DUDLEY realises that LOLA is genuinely enjoying herself.  He 
        continues to shake the bucket on his foot.

        Suddenly the bucket flies off.  It crashes into an ornament

        DUDLEY launches himself across the bed, runs across the room and                                     LOLA

        CARTER exits. 


        A clap of thunder.  A hand flicking through the pages of a

                      What's the matter?

        SHIRLEY hesitates for a moment, then brushes past. 

        VIENNA watches him go, an inscrutable expression on her face.

        CONNIE hesitates, not sure what to say, catches a glimpse of RUBY 
      who is enthusiastically greeting CHRIS CHURCH with a snog.  CHRIS 
      is dressed "casual smart", has made a little too much effort.

        SHIRLEY rips open the door and drops down into the seat.  He's 
        reeling.  Barely able to control himself.  LIAM watches him for 
        a moment, unsure how to respond.  Then, hesitantly, he begins.

                      A right pickle...         DUDLEY gets up pushing his chair back. 

                                    DUDLEY 
                      I'll...send you a cheque.

                      Well what...what do you want..?

        A crack of thunder.  LOLA, still in just her nightie, turns around.  
      The door of the poker room opens.  The corridor is flooded with 


        DUDLEY emerges still in his boxer shorts and vest. He speeds 


                                    LOLA 
                      Dudley..? 

                                    DUDLEY 
                      We've got to get out of here. 

      LEO and the others have come out into the corridor. 

                                    LEO 
                      You're not going anywhere son. 

        DUDLEY grabs LOLA'S arm and starts pulling her towards the front 


                                    LOLA 
                      What's going on... 

                                    DUDLEY 
                      I've lost a bit of money.  It's fine.  


                                    LOLA 
                      I haven't got any clothes on. 

                                    LEO 
                      There's a tab to be cleared son.  You 


                                    DUDLEY 
                      You can't make me.  You're a bunch of 
                      cheats.  I don't want anything to do 


        DUDLEY wrenches open the front door to reveal SHIRLEY WOOLF 
        finger poised by the bell.  SHIRLEY stands there staring at them. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      I hope you haven't started without me. 

        SHIRLEY glances down at LOLA in her short nightie.                                      SHIRLEY 
                      Who's this? 

        DUDLEY takes her arm. 

                                    DUDLEY 
                      We're just leaving.

                      We've got a little problem.  The kid 


                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Oh really? 

                                    LEO 
                      Three grand.   

                                    LOLA 
                      Three grand! 

                                    LEO 
                      We've come to an...arrangement. 

      LOLA looks at DUDLEY. 

                                    LOLA 
                      Dudley...? 

                                    DUDLEY 
                      I've agreed to nothing. 

        DUDLEY moves to go and SHIRLEY blocks his path. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Not going are you? 

        SHIRLEY turns to LEO. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Got their address? 

      LEO produces the registration book open at the SUTTON'S details, 
      alone on the page.  The distant weeping begins from upstairs. 



                                    SHIRLEY 
                      On your way then.                              (with menace) 
                      I can always pop round some time.  Pay 


        SILENCE.  LIAM appears behind SHIRLEY. 

                                    LIAM 
                      Dad.  We've got a problem. 

        SHIRLEY looks past LIAM at the car.  A dull thumping can be heard.  

                                                                              CUT TO:
