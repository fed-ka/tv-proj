An upstate New York town. A CIRCUS is being dismantled...The
Big Top falls and is gathered up by workmen...Trucks are
being loaded with animals.
AN ELDERLY MAN , JACOB JANKOWSKI - 93 year old - stands
alone, with a walker in the middle of the empty parking lot.
His shirt is stained with sweat - as if it took great effort
for him to get there. As he watches the Circus disappear,
Jacob looks lost, bewildered and fragile.
CHARLIE, 50's circus manager, and RUSS, a tattooed teen with
rings through his eyebrows, approach him with a wheelchair.
CHARLIE
Excuse me sir, can we help you?
(No reply from Jacob)
Did you miss your ride?
JACOB
I missed the Spec.
RUSS
The what?
CHARLIE
Yes, I'm afraid you did. Can we
call someone for you?
JACOB
(SAD)
Where'd it all go?
RUSS
He's seriously old.
CHARLIE
Did you come with the folks from
the retirement home?
JACOB
No, I came on my own.
CHARLIE
(IGNORING HIM)
Let's go inside and we can call
them to pick you up.
Charlie motions for Russ to get Jacob in the wheelchair.
Jacob resists.
2.
JACOB
No, I told ya, I came on my own and
I'm not going back. Get your hands
off me.
RUSS
(as if talking to a child)
It's OK. We're gonna call the home
so they can come pick you up.
JACOB
(SUDDENLY LUCID)
Why don't you pick some of those
rings out ya head maybe you won't
be so stupid, ya dumb little shit.
RUSS
Woah! The language. Uncalled for.
CHARLIE
Sir, we need to get you out of this
parking lot. My trucks have to come
through here. Please...
He offers the wheelchair. Jacob relents and sits.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I got it Russ. Take the walker.
Finish closing up the ticket booth.
Russ takes the walker and exits as Charlie wheels Jacob.
JACOB
In my day, they had old timers in
the ticket wicket and freaks like
him in the sideshow. Damn kid
didn't even know what the Spec was.
CHARLIE
You sound like you know circuses.
Charlie checks his watch, impatient to get Jacob home.
JACOB
I should. I was on two.
CHARLIE
(Calling OS to Trucks)
Malcolm, tell them to come through!
(Patronizing, to Jacob)
Two circuses. Wow, that's
something.
3.
JACOB
Ringling, of course, but that was
later...
CHARLIE
I'll need your name when I call the
home.
JACOB
...First one was called Benzini
Brothers Most Spectacular Show ...
Charlie suddenly stops upon hearing that name.
CHARLIE
What?...Wait a minute! Did you say
you were with the Benzini Brothers?
(JACOB NODS)
What years?
JACOB
1931.
CHARLIE
"31?...You're saying you were there
for the---?
JACOB
I was in the middle of it.
CHARLIE
(INCREDULOUS)
I don't believe this. After the
Hartford Fire and the Hagenback-
Wallace Wreck, that's the most
famous circus disaster of all time.
JACOB
I remember it like yesterday...
Better - cause I don't remember
yesterday.
CHARLIE
(EXTENDS HAND)
Charlie O'Brien the third.
JACOB
Jacob Jankowski the only.
CHARLIE
Mr. Jankowski, I would be honored
if you would have a drink with me
in my trailer.
4.
A simple, clapboard house in a middle class neighborhood.
Jacob runs out, passing his father's sign on the front lawn:
E. JANKOWSKI
Doctor of Veterinary Medicine
The beautiful campus of Cornell University. Jacob runs.
JACOB (V.O.)
After six years of dissections,
castrations, foalings and shoving
my arm up a cow's ass more times
than I cared to remember, I was
finally going to graduate Cornell
in Veterinary Science. I was summa
cum laude...ha,ha and the oldest
male virgin on campus.
6.
Jacob steps outside with Dean Wilkins.
DEAN WILKINS
Jacob, it's your parents. I'm
afraid there's been a car accident.
Jacob in his black suit walking home..looks up ahead to see:
All the family possessions are on the lawn being scoured over
by strangers: father's Philco radio, mother's jewelry...A
foreclosure sign hangs beside his father's business sign:
JACOB (V.O.)
Things happened so fast, my head
was spinning. And that mortgage...I
just couldn't figure it out.
A DELIVERY TRUCK pulls up at the curb. It is met by A BANK
REPRESENTATIVE, who receives a package and carries it to
Jacob, meeting him halfway.
BANK REPRESENTATIVE
This just came for you, Jacob.
Whatever it is I'm going to have to
include in the bank's report of
assets. Sorry. You OK?
(JACOB NODS)
I also have documents to sign..
The Bank Representative continues MOS as Jacob opens the
package,
JACOB (V.O.)
I didn't believe the lawyer or the
bank. My mother worked. They had
savings. We were never broke. So
why would they need a mortgage?
And then it hit me...
Jacob opens the package revealing a BRAND NEW SIGN, reading;
E. JANKOWSKI AND SON
DOCTORS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE
9.
JACOB (V.O.)
They did it to pay for my Ivy
League education.
For a moment Jacob can't move. This thought stuns him. With
his house being picked apart and the Bank Representative
speaking about papers, Jacob can't take it any longer. He
drops the sign and walks away. The Bank Rep calls after him:
BANK REPRESENTATIVE
Jacob? Jacob they need these signed
by the end of the business day.
Jacob walks away from the Bank Rep, pulling off his tie and
tossing it. He is crying - the reality finally hitting him.
JACOB (V.O.)
I walked and I kept on walking...
It's a strange feeling becoming an
orphan the same time you're
becoming a man...To have this
freedom to be anything you want at
the same time everything you were
is taken away. So I just walked
...Then all of a sudden, I stopped.
Jacob stands with his feet in a clear stream. He is no longer
crying. There are dense woods, pitch black, all around him.
JACOB (V.O.)
Like I'd been sleepwalking and I
woke up. I had no idea where I was.
Jacob can hear the buzz of insects, the glow of fireflies and
the cries of distant animals in the woods. It unnerves him.
Far off beyond the dense woods Jacob sees A MOVING FLICKERING
LIGHT - like a distant, silent star moving past the trees.
The Light is moving around the woods until it curves towards
Jacob's direction. He hears a distant CLANK-CLANK...
Curious, Jacob puts his shoes on and walks back to a gravel
path that leads to TRAIN TRACKS just as:
THE MASSIVE TRAIN ENGINE EXPLODES INTO VIEW PASSING HIM.
Jacob is so close, he is hit by a wall of wind that nearly
knocks him down. It is dark and the train is moving fast.
10.
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
What is it inside of us makes us
decide to grab onto life again and
again, no matter how many times it
abandons us without a second
thought?...What is it makes us
hungry for more of the same?
Somebody smart should figure that
one out.
Jacob makes his decision: He runs parallel to the
train...stumbling over gravel, pitching forward and losing
his balance, recovering, then running faster, scanning for
something to grab hold of to hoist himself up. He sees:
AN OPEN STOCK CAR IS THREE CARS BEHIND HIM...As it catches up
to him, he lunges forward, reaching for the iron grab hold
and flings himself upward. He clings on with his left leg,
elbow and chin. His right hand clings to the grab hold. With
his left hand, he claws the floorboards of the stock car, but
the aged wood scraps off under his fingers. His right leg is
dangling, beneath the train itself, dangerously close to the
tracks. Jacob is slipping...slipping...
With everything he's got, Jacob makes one final "life or
death" effort, managing to get his left knee up over the
edge. Using foot, knee, chin, elbow and fingernails, he
scrapes his way inside the stock car and lies panting...
The Train has stopped adjacent to a huge grassy lot. Beyond
it, the scattered buildings of Deposit, NY backlit by dawn.
13.
Jacob jumps out of the stock car, in awe of what he sees::
Hundreds of dirty, unshaven men pouring out of the train
like ants on candy. The wagons of the train are painted
scarlet red with gold trim and sunburst wheels. Emblazoned on
each wagon; BENZINI BROTHERS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH.
Jacob wanders as the Circus is being created: Canvas tents
are raised, the Big Top laying sprawled on the ground. Men
standing over seams, lacing pieces together...Eight man
sledge teams pound stakes into the ground at breakneck
speed....Teams of men are raising enormous poles with their
combined weight, chanting: Pull it! Shake it! Break it!
Again!...Now down stake it!...Several teams horses pulling
wagons are charging right for Jacob..
Jacob jumps out of the way, nearly being run down. He is out
of place...in the way of this finely tuned machine.
Jacob ducks into a LARGE TENT for safety.
Camel escorts Jacob through the grounds to a baggage car.
CAMEL
Gonna try to get you set up with
Crazy Joe.
JACOB
Do I call him Crazy Joe?
CAMEL
It has been said Crazy Joe went to
prison for killing a man who spit
into the wind and hit the back of
Joe's neck. So no, I would not call
this man Crazy Joe to his face.
Camel and Jacob walks on to an open stock car door, where
CRAZY JOE stands - a burly man, missing three fingers.
CAMEL (CONT'D)
Hey Joe! I got a First of May here.
Think you can use him?
Crazy Joe scans Jacob, shoots an oyster of dark brown tobacco
juice then disappears back inside. Camel tells Jacob;
CAMEL (CONT'D)
You're in, kid.
15.
Jacob and another Young Man, WADE, with their shirts off, are
shovelling tons of horse manure. Jacob is queasy, blinking
from the stench. The Young Man doesn't seem bothered.
JACOB
I've never seen so much manure!
WADE
Baggage stock horses. They pack'em
in 27 a car.
JACOB
How do you stand the smell?
WADE
What smell?
Jacob and several other Flying Squadron men struggle to pull
on cables hoisting up the canvases on the Big Top. It takes a
tremendous effort. Jacob uses every bit of strength.
When the Big Top is raised, Jacob can't help but be impressed
with the accomplishment as the local townsfolk (rubes) cheer.
CECIL, THE BARKER, is "speechifying" from a platform beside
the sideshow entrance, strutting back and forth, as a crowd
gathers... Jacob and other working men, including Wade, are
positioned around the perimeter of the crowd.
WADE
When Cecil gives the signal ya
gotta push the rubes in towards the
entrance but without them catching
on or else they'll be a fight.
Jacob, Wade and the other men position themselves equidistant
around the perimeter of the crowd facing Cecil.
16.
When Cecil pulls his ear (the Signal)...Jacob and the other
men move forward, inching the crowd into the sideshow tents.
Jacob shovels YAK manure more easily having taped his
blistered hands.
Grady hands Jacob a long lead pipe.
GRADY
Stand inside the tent and smack the
sides with this when you see a head
trying to peek in without paying.
Jacob follows Grady into the tent...
The Big Top drops. Poles topple. Horses, men and equipment
dismantle the great city of tents.
JACOB (V.O.)
And then just as quickly, heaven
was packed away and gone.
They reach a platform facing the fanciest car yet. Standing
upon it is an enormous, muscular BALD MAN, EARL...
CAMEL
This here's Earl. He's gonna take
you in. Earl, this here's Jacob.
JACOB
(shakes hands w/Camel)
I don't know how to thank you.
CAMEL
HA! You may not want to after you
been on a show long as I have. Good
luck to ya, kid.
Camel exits OS. Alone with Earl, Jacob asks:
JACOB
Do I look OK?
EARL
Very nice.
Then, with one hand Earl slides back the door and with the
other hand, violently grabs Jacob by the neck and throws him
head first into the car.
August and Jacob exit onto the platform.
AUGUST
Are you sure-footed, Jacob
Jankowski?
JACOB
I believe so.
26.
AUGUST
Good.
Without missing a beat, August leans forward, catches hold of
something around the side of the car and disappears.
JACOB
JESUS CHRIST!
The train jerks a curve. Jacob almost falls.
AUGUST (O.S.)
COME ON THEN!
Jacob looks up to see:
August is on the roof of the train: his face moonlit, his
hair blowing wildly in the wind...He points downward.
Jacob, none too pleased, advances to the edge of the platform
as the train speeds by, and looks where August is pointing;
He can see the edge of a thin iron ladder. He wipes his hands
on his thighs. Focuses. Then leaps...
Jacob's right hand meets the ladder. His left grasps wildly
until it ensnares the other side. His feet jam into the
rungs. Jacob climbs to the roof.
August gives Jacob a hand up and they sit cross legged.
POV; THE LENGTH OF THE TRAIN AHEAD OF THEM STRETCHES LIKE A
GIANT SNAKE MOVING IN THE NIGHT, BENDING ROUND A CURVE.
AUGUST
It's a breath taking sight, isn't
it? Always gets me.
(THEN:)
I can't get a new Liberty Horse mid-
season. So you make sure this horse
performs and the job's yours. Nine
bucks a week. If you cross me, I'll
feed you to my meat eaters and
there won't be a trace left of
you...
Jacob hangs on every word. August smiles;
(MORE)
27.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
You do right by me, Jacob
Jankowski...I'll show you what it's
like to travel every inch of this
country, every inch of this world,
and be welcomed home in every
street, be loved in every
town...I'll give you a life most
suckers can't dream of.
Jacob is mesmerized by August. August stands and tap dances
across the roofs. Jacob has no choice but to follow...
The two men dance and leap atop the train from car to car
across the moving train...Jacob grows increasingly confident
and euphoric following August's exultant lead.
Jacob is washing himself with dirty water out of a bucket
beside Camel. Camel starts hitting his leg. He laughs:
CAMEL
Ha, this gam of mine keeps falling
asleep on me. Pretty soon the only
place for me is going to be selling
tickets but I'm too ugly for that.
AUGUST (O.S.)
Jacob!
Camel straightens up when August appears, clearly on his
guard. He turns his back to continue washing.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
We can do better than this for our
new vet. I'll arrange for you to
start getting your own water bucket
like the performers and bosses. Two
buckets per person. Come...
August walks away as Jacob hurries to follow...
JACOB
See ya Camel.
CAMEL
(sips his Jake)
Yeah, take care kid.
INT PERFORMER'S TENT - LIBERTY, NY - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT
August and Jacob enter a more upscale tent where male
performers are washing from personal buckets of water.
AUGUST
You'll need new clothes too. I'll
set you up with the Monday Man.
JACOB
Monday Man?
30.
AUGUST
What day of the week did your
mother hang out the wash to dry?
JACOB
(REALIZING)
He takes other people's clothes?
AUGUST
It's the Depression, Cornell. Where
have you been? Oh right - Cornell.
Kinko is bathing with his two buckets when August snatches
one of them away.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Here, use Kinko's second bucket for
now.
(TO KINKO)
You barely use up one.
Kinko fumes. Jacob tries to placate.
JACOB
August, it's all right, I'll--
AUGUST
(IGNORES HIM)
If you need a razor, there are some
back there with my name on them.
August walks away. Jacob follows August away from Kinko.
JACOB
August..
When August stops, Jacob is caught off guard...
AUGUST
(SINCERE)
It's good to have an educated man
like you around. I need one other
sane individual in this operation.
JACOB
(COMPLIMENTED)
Thank you for everything, August.
August pats his back and exits. Jacob heads for the bucket.
AUGUST (O.S.)
Ah...Jacob?
31.
JACOB
(STOPS)
Yes, August?
AUGUST
The horse.
August wants Jacob to follow him to the horse. Jacob thought
he was going to bathe.
JACOB
Oh! Yes...The horse.
Jacob follows behind August's commanding stride.
Diamond Joe and GREG, a ring stock man in overalls, are
leading the Marlena's horses out of the ring stock car...
AUGUST
I'm sure it's nothing serious.
Don't tell my wife I said this but
she coddles them too much. She has
a particularly strong affection for
Silver Star. I don't encourage it.
It's unhealthy to love an animal
that much...Here she is.
Marlena runs up to them, still in her bed clothes/robe.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Darling, meet Jacob Jankowski,
Benzini Brothers own veterinarian.
JACOB
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Marlena barely acknowledges Jacob - keeping their previous
meeting a secret (for which Jacob is grateful). August puts
his arm around her and they kiss.
AUGUST
Last stall. Lead the way, doc.
They enter the ring stock car...
32.
TWO BUCKETS FILLED WITH PUTRID MEAT. Flies buzzing on top.
Diamond Joe finishes filling the buckets as August grabs one.
AUGUST
Joe, bad report for Silver Star I'm
afraid. Jacob here says there's no
hope. We're going to have to put
him down...
Diamond Joe registers a concerned, anxious look to Jacob.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
...So I need you to round up Pete
and Greg, get a wagon and a harness
stretcher. He has to be hauled.
DIAMOND JOE
A harness what?
AUGUST
Jacob and I'll take care of the
cats. We'll meet you back at the
stall.
(TO JACOB)
Grab the other bucket, will you?
Diamond Joe seems uneasy about this as we follow August and
Jacob, who comments on the putrid meat.
JACOB
August, this stuff has gone off. Do
the cats really eat this?
34.
AUGUST
No, they really love goats.
(Jacob looks to him)
We're all out of goats.
Jacob waits with the buckets outside the car. August is
inside unlocking the padlocks, then reappears and jumps out.
AUGUST
Go ahead. They get a bucket each.
Apprehensive, Jacob hops up. August hands him the buckets.
A determined, pent-up Jacob marches towards Bill and Grady
who are taking a break, smoking. Camel is drinking Jake...
CAMEL
Hey kid. What are you doing on the
wrong side of the tracks?
JACOB
I need a gun.
CAMEL
It can't be that bad...
They laugh but Jacob insists boldly.
JACOB
I need a gun! Or a rifle! Now!
Grady leans inside the open car door and gets him a rifle.
Jacob takes it and marches back. They watch him, curiously.
Jacob passes Blackie on the way and boldly ignores his
intimidating stance....Performers and workmen sense a drama
brewing and follow Jacob to see what is happening.
The train is pulling into the site of a "ghost town"
abandoned circus; a dilapidated Big Top, broken wagons and
tents, desolate performers walking about idly or sitting in
the shade.
As the train pulls into Goshen, performers stick their heads
out the window to see....Jacob sits in the open stock car
with Kinko and Queenie:
42.
JACOB
Why are we stopping?
KINKO
August loves his sideshow freaks.
There's a guy with this outfit who
has a parasitic twin growing out of
his chest. He dresses it in a tiny
tuxedo and black patent leather
shoes. No talent but a real money-
maker with the rubes. Calls himself
the Man and a Half. Goddamn
August'll pay him double what he
pays me just for the irony.
JACOB
What happened to this circus?
KINKO
Went belly up. Pretty common
nowadays. Circus bosses see the end
coming and they'd pull a runner
with all the money. Menagerie
belongs to the town now. August can
get anything he wants for a song.
Jacob and Kinko watch August striding through the grounds as
desperate performers hopeful for work rush up to him.
KINKO (CONT'D)
Most of them will never belong to
another show. And they know it.
August is helped by Earl, who pushes the performers aside so
August can head straight for the Goshen TOWN OFFICIALS,
standing beside an Oldsmobile. They exchange greetings.
Crazy Joe is organizing the Flying Squadron to take whatever
parts of the Fox Circus remains that they can use.
Jacob is checking baggage stock horses when he sees:
Marlena sitting alone outside her stateroom. He walks to her.
Just as he reaches her, Marlena turns to him, looking as if
she hadn't slept in days. Before they can speak, they hear:
EARL
MARLENA! JACOB! AUGUST WANTS YOU!
43.
A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE IS POPPED OPEN...
A deliriously happy August is walking and holding the
champagne, pouring glasses held by Earl who then hands one
each to Marlena, Jacob, Diamond Joe and Crazy Joe as they all
walk towards the Fox Bros. Menagerie Tent.
AUGUST
We have a new star!
DIAMOND JOE
The Man and a Half?
AUGUST
Nah, lousy Ringling got here first.
But we got better! A bull!
JACOB
A bull?
AUGUST
A bull elephant! Her name is Rosie,
she's fifty-three and she's
brilliant. The best bull they had.
I'm going to come up with a whole
new Star Act around her and
Marlena..
(TO MARLENA)
You can ride her in the Spec from
now on, since we have no Liberty
Horse.
August smiles at Marlena who looks back contemptuously, upset
about Silver Star. August ignores her. Jacob notices the
exchange between them.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
(Pours himself a glass.)
...Our own bull! Ringling can't
hold that over us now. I'm
renovating an entire car just for
her.
CRAZY JOE
Just for the elephant! But the
bunkers are at capacity! I've got
roustabouts three to a bunk.
August tosses off this concern.
44.
AUGUST
We'll find places for everyone. And
when our new star sells tickets,
we'll buy another car! We're a show
to be reckoned with now!
(TOASTS)
...TO THE BENZINI BROTHERS MOST
SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH!
Jacob and Kinko look out of the open ring stock car to see:
August is standing before A MAN who is being held by
Blackie's Men and punched by Blackie himself. The Man is
bleeding and bruised. Various other performers and working
men also watch the brutality;
49.
KINKO
Six men got red lit last night.
Cancelling shows and that damn
elephant cost August. He needed to
clean house to save on payroll...
It's a lousy day when an animal
gets paid and men don't.
JACOB
Why are they beating him?
KINKO
He hid one of the men who was
supposed to be tossed. Word was the
train was over a trestle instead of
land. Nobody comes back from that.
THEY HEAR:
AUGUST
Get rid of him. He comes back on my
property, you can shoot him.
August walks away, with Earl and his men in tow. Blackie and
his men drag the beaten Man away. As they turn, Jacob
recognizes the Man;
It is WADE who worked Jacob on his first day.
A drunk Jacob sees the ring stock car door open, filled with
people's legs hanging out and loud voices from within.
When Jacob hops out, he sees performers and roustabouts all
gathered by a performer train car, huddling and discussing.
He crosses to investigate, meeting up with August Diamond Joe
and Mr. Erwin...
AUGUST
We got big trouble. Lucinda died.
Now we've got no center ring star
act and no sideshow star...
JACOB
How did she die?
MR. ERWIN
I don't know where we're gonna find
a fat lady this late in the season.
AUGUST
I don't care where you find one,
but find one.
(To Diamond Joe)
Better get some kind of rig set up
to lift her out of the car. How did
you carry Silver Star out?
DIAMOND JOE
In pieces.
AUGUST
Oh yes...
(considers for a second)
Mmmm...
JACOB
August!
AUGUST
No, no, of course, don't be silly!
Right. Well, figure something else
out Joe but get it down for the
performance. Put her in the hippo
tank for now.
(TO JACOB)
You better start on that elephant.
We need her performing yesterday.
63.
Out of the darkness of her car, the enormous elephant
emerges, being led down a ramp by Jacob.
Jacob - cleaned, dressed and hung over - sits crossed legged
in front of Rosie. The two stare at each other. Rosie's nose
searching the ground for something to eat. Jacob, without
energy or focus, his head pounding, orders her;
JACOB
Rosie...Up.
Rosie just looks at him without moving.
JACOB (CONT'D)
Up. Rosie. Up.
Rosie's trunk starts to sniff around Jacob.
JACOB (CONT'D)
Rosie....Walk!...STEP!..Rosie STEP!
Rosie's trunk investigates Jacob's body, tapping his head.
JACOB (CONT'D)
Rosie please. My hair hurts.
Rosie's trunk snakes around him.
JACOB (CONT'D)
No...No more Cracker Jack until you
do something....Rosie!...
Rosie curls her trunk around Jacob and slowly topples him
sideways, turning him over as he weakly threatens;
JACOB (CONT'D)
I'm getting really mad now....I
mean it...Rosie stop...
Rosie gets the Cracker Jack from his back pocket...
AUGUST (V.O.)
You just can't get enough of
somebody in your pants, can you?
Jacob quickly gets up as August strides towards him;
64.
AUGUST (V.O. (CONT'D)
Heard you had a rough night?
JACOB
Does everybody know what happened?
AUGUST
Yes.
JACOB
Can somebody tell me?
August suppresses a laugh.
AUGUST
I'm opening the midway and the
menagerie this afternoon for some
extra cash before the show tomorrow
night. We'll see how she does with
the crowd. She got any skills?
JACOB
Finding food? But I don't really
know how to do this.
AUGUST
Well, first of all, you can't do
anything with a bull without the
bull hook.
August takes the BULL HOOK from the ground.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
It's the only way to train them.
Watch.
Jacob steps back.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
UP!..UP!...COME ON UP!
August stabs Rosie behind the shoulder..Jacob winces. Rosie
lifts her foot a little.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
HIGHER UP...UP!
August keeps jabbing her with the hook...dotting her flesh
with blood. Jacob gets upset.
JACOB
August, there's got to be another
way.
65.
AUGUST
We don't have the time! She has to
start earning her keep MOVE! UP!
UP!!
August stabs her other shoulder...harder...continuing to
shout. Rosie is getting agitated...pulling away from him but
constrained by her chain. Her eyes fearful.
Other performers rehearsing in the area begin to watch as
August strikes Rosie harder and harder. She begins to bleed.
Jacob tries to stop August by going for the bull hook...
JACOB
Please, August, let me try again.
But August angrily pulls it away and turns on Jacob:
AUGUST
Don't tell me my business! You
don't want to watch this, get the
hell out! Making love to it ain't
going to work. Besides, from what I
hear, you're not that good at it.
(TO ROSIE)
GET UP! UP!!!
Jacob watches, upset and furious at August's treatment.
A VAT OF LEMONADE LEFT ON THE CONCESSION STAND, which is in
the process of being dismantled. Work men are carrying items
back to the train.
WE SEE: Rosie's trunk come out from under the canvas, her
body hidden, searching for the lemonade.
Jacob peers out to see: Rosie's trunk dip itself into the vat
of lemonade and drink the entire contents.
Jacob is amazed. He looks around: Workmen are some distance
away loading the train. No one else sees her.
Rosie finishes then turns back into the menagerie.
As the train travels to Weekhawken, New Jersey...Jacob is
looking out of open car to NYC skyline across the river.
JACOB (V.O.)
We were on our way to the
Manhattan/ Jersey show and Mr.
Erwin still hadn't found a fat
lady. Tickets sales were low. So
August, ha,ha...August pulled a hat
trick.
August is sitting atop Rosie, smiling, waving his top hat,
then forlornly placing it against his chest and lowering his
head in respect for Lucinda. Manhattan is in the distance.
67.
JACOB (V.O.)
A parade like you never saw, a
funeral and a celebration, saying
goodbye to one star, introducing a
new one...playing those rubes dying
to get a peek like he was rolling a
coin over his finger tips...
Rosie leads a small parade of clowns, including Walter and a
perky, healthy Queenie down the main street. Marlena sits
atop a Percheron, in full costume. Jacob walks astride.
Lucinda's Wagon, carrying "the dead Lucinda", follows.
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It wasn't really Lucinda in there.
It was Barbara in a fat suit and
wig inside the hippo den. We buried
the real Lucinda by the railroad
tracks between towns. Cemeteries
cost too much. We were the only
family she knew.
People line up to cheer and offer their silent respects...and
satisfy a ghoulish fascination at the "dead" fat lady.
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
August sure was right about Rosie.
She pulled the people right in.
Rosie played that crowd like a pro.
The rubes love the exotic Rosie...kids run up to pet her with
their parents.
As Rosie passes, we see AN OLD WOMAN standing in front of her
green shuttered house waving with delight. We see she has a
abundant vegetable garden which Rosie eyes covertly.
WE HEAR: The Band playing from inside the Big Top as the
performers and ring stock are lined up for the Grand Spec.
JACOB
But as soon as the Spec started, we
all knew it was too soon for
Rosie's debut.
Rosie heads the line. Marlena sits atop her, in her sequins
and headdress, grabbing onto Rosie's leather halter.
68.
August stands beside with the bull hook. His face is cold and
still. His fingers clutch and release the bull hook.
The SPEC MUSIC begins and everyone makes last minute
adjustments...Kinko and Queenie included....August shouts
into Rosie's ear.
AUGUST
MOVE! MOVE!
Rosie hesitates so August strikes her right shoulder with the
bull hook. The pain sends Rosie flying through the Big Top
flap, causing Marlena to adeptly flatten her back atop Rosie
so as not to hit her head on the pole that runs across the
Big Top flap.
Others gasp at the near accident. August is already furious.
Jacob senses danger ahead. He follows in, curling the edge of
the sidewall so as not to impede the Spec performers.
Jacob rushes to her. Marlena, in pain, collapses in his arms.
MARLENA
Oh Jacob...
August rushes out and is stopped cold by the sight of
Marlena in Jacob's arms. He immediately tenses up.
JACOB
August, she's hurt.
August takes her in his arms. Barbara appears to help.
70.
AUGUST
I'm here, darling, I've got you.
BARBARA
Bring her to my tent, it's closer.
AUGUST
Jacob, send Joe for ice. You go and
find that Goddamn bull before we're
run out town. And take the hook!
August is seething, his expression cold, as he carries
Marlena O.S. Jacob, concerned, takes the hook and runs O.S.
Rosie is standing in a vegetable garden calmly feeding
herself cabbages. The owner is the OLD WOMAN who was
delighted by Rosie in the parade. She is now screaming
hitting her with a small garden shovel...Jacob runs up.
JACOB
I'm sorry ma'am. I'll get her.
OLD WOMAN
You better before she gets at my --
AAHHH, MY TOMATOES! YOU MONSTER!!
Rosie has helped herself to tomatoes. Jacob steps in.
JACOB
Rosie, no! Stop!
Rosie pauses for a moment, flapping her ears at Jacob, then
shoves a bush of tomatoes in her mouth. Jacob almost laughs.
JACOB (CONT'D)
Bad elephant, that's not nice. This
kind lady hasn't invited you.
OLD WOMAN
ARE YOU CRAZY TALKING TO AN
ELEPHANT!? SHOOT IT! BEFORE IT EATS
MY HOUSE! I'M CALLING THE POLICE!
She exits into the house as Rosie wraps her trunk around
cabbages, uprooting them, as Jacob tries to battle her trunk.
Greg arrives with a bucket he places in front of Rosie. Her
trunk stops fighting Jacob and sniffs inside the bucket.
71.
JACOB
What's in the bucket?
GREG
Gin and ginger ale. Elephants love
booze. One whiff of this and she's
not thinking about cabbages no
more.
(Bats her trunk away)
... moj malutki paczuszek?
JACOB
Greg, right? Are you Polish?
GREG
Grabowski.
JACOB
Jankowski.
Greg again pushes Rosie's trunk away from the bucket.
GREG
Last show I worked, one bull faked
a belly ache just to get the
whiskey...Better grab the hook.
JACOB
Are you a bull man? August would
hire you in a minute.
GREG
Don't want the job. Not for him.
Besides, I'm not bull man. I just
like big beasts.
Jacob gets it and follows Greg who carries the bucket.
GREG (CONT'D)
Is she following?
Jacob turns around to see and sure enough:
Rosie is leaving the garden and trotting behind to catch up
to the bucket of gin and ginger ale. Jacob's impressed.
The show is still in progress - we can hear the band playing
for the aerialist act in the background.
72.
As Jacob makes his way to Marlena's stateroom he crosses
paths with August, whose face is "dark as thunder".
JACOB
How's Marlena?
AUGUST
A little shaky. Sore wrists.
Bruised heel. Doc says she'll be
fine. Did you catch the bull?
JACOB
She's in the menagerie.
AUGUST
Good.
August takes the bull hook from Jacob and walks with cold
blooded intent towards the menagerie. Jacob panics, realizing
what August about to do. Jacob follows to stop him;
JACOB
August! Wait! She was good! She
came back on her own! Besides, you
can't do anything now! The show is
still going on.
AUGUST
(WALKING)
Good. The band will drown it out.
JACOB
AUGUST, NO!
Jacob touches August's arm. August turns on Jacob with a
murderous expression, shoving him to the ground. Jacob is
about to get up to fight but August cautions him with the
bull hook to stay down. August smiles slightly. Would he
really use that bull hook on Jacob or is he kidding? Jacob
stays down. August continues on, entering the menagerie tent.
MARLENA (O.S.)
Jacob!
Jacob sees Marlena running towards him.
Jacob and Marlena run across the grounds to the menagerie as
workmen are running out of the menagerie tent, hearing August
screaming from inside. They enter the menagerie tent to see:
73.
Marlena and Jacob step away, hearing Rosie cry out. Marlena
can't bear it. She grabs Jacob's hand for support. Jacob
tentatively holds onto her waist, guiding her away. She leans
into him. Jacob loves being this close to her.
The screams of August O.S. pull their attention to see:
Earl and his men physically dragging a maniacal August out of
the tent, his bull hook and clothes bloodied by his rage. He
is kicking and struggling against them like a madman.
Jacob is shocked by August's behavior. But Marlena has seen
it before. She pulls away from Jacob and exits O.S. alone.
Earl's men are smoking, when one sees Jacob marching angrily
towards August's stateroom, carrying the bull hook. Alerted;
EARL'S MAN
Somebody better find Earl.
Jacob jumps down off the platform. Confused and disgusted, he
takes the bull hook, wedges it under the train and breaks it
in half.
An excited Jacob is leading August to the menagerie tent.
Jacob is thrown into the alley. People are piling into cars,
engines are starting, wheels squealing.
Suddenly, Marlena appears, grabbing Jacob's hand. She takes
off her shoes. They run through back streets.
They run under a fire escape, panting, out of breath. The
sirens and screams of the crowd are distant.
MARLENA
Lord, that was close...Aw, look at
my stockings! And they're silk too.
JACOB
I wonder if August got out...
Marlena looks up at Jacob and starts laughing hysterically,
as if for no reason. They are both still drunk.
JACOB (CONT'D)
...I don't know how we're going to
get home. I've never been in New
York, have you?
Marlena's laughing subsides as she gets an idea.
MARLENA
I want to see the Empire State
Building.
JACOB
What...what about August?
MARLENA
I don't know where he is, do you?
And he doesn't know where we are.
It's not our fault. Like you said,
who knows how long it'll take us to
get back.
Jacob is hesitant. Marlena takes his hand and softly pleads;
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Just a few hours, Jacob. For just a
few hours, we don't belong
anywhere...we don't belong to
anyone...Please.
82.
Jacob looks in her eyes and knows he shouldn't, but...
JACOB (V.O.)
I was doomed.
He smiles. Marlena beams. They run off.
A summer storm with thunder and lightening is coming towards
them from over the Hudson River.
Marlena and Jacob are looking out at the expansive 1931 view
of New York City. Other couples stroll about the sky deck.
Marlena breathes in deeply...
MARLENA
I've never seen so far. Have you?
(Jacob shakes head)
Look at it. As far as the eye can
see and it's nowhere near all
that's out there.
Jacob notices tears in her eyes.
JACOB
Are you all right?
MARLENA
(LAUGHING/CRYING)
Yes. No. Yes, hahaha I'm fine. I'm
a complete mess...ha...
THE THUNDER BREAKS AND THE RAIN BEGINS TO POUR...
Suddenly, MARLENA SCREAMS as loud as she can, startling the
other couples. Jacob laughs. Beat of silence, then:
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Sorry.
But Jacob understands; He screams and Marlena joins in.
JACOB MARLENA
AAAHAHAHAAHAAAHAAAAA AHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAH
The other couples leave the sky deck to get out of the rain
and away from "that crazy couple".
Marlena and Jacob stop, wet, panting, laughing from the
release. Then, looking out at the view, not at each other...
83.
Marlena begins to confess what she needs Jacob to know.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Jacob? I need you to do something
for me. Promise me you will.
JACOB
(HOPEFUL)
Anything.
MARLENA
I want you to go. I want you get
away from us, from the show. You're
smart Jacob. You deserve better
than us. Leave as soon as you can
or something terrible's going to
happen.
JACOB
(surprised, confused)
Why are you saying this?
MARLENA
It's all right. No one can hear.
We'll never get another chance to
say it all.
Marlena looks into Jacob's eyes and finally addresses what
they're both thinking;
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Nothing can ever happen with us,
you know. It's too dangerous.
August will never let me go. You
don't know what he's capable of.
JACOB
How can you be with a man you're
frightened of?
MARLENA
I'm not. I don't have to feel
afraid of him if I don't feel
anything...After all these years,
I've learned how to do it so well.
I tell myself, "I'm managing. I can
manage him. August loves me. Nobody
else ever did. Who am I to say it's
the wrong kind of love?" .. See,
there's no place for a woman like
me in any decent kind of world. You
know where they found me when I was
a baby? ...
(MORE)
84.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
...In an alley behind a whore house
in Baltimore wrapped in newspaper.
No one even bothered to leave a
note...This circus, my horses -
this is the only kind of life I can
have.
(BREAKING DOWN)
August made a woman like me a star
attraction...I'm lucky. And I'm
safe...And I was fine - before you
came.
Jacob feels sorry and hopeful at the same time...
MARLENA (CONT'D)
There's nothing that can cause a
woman so much trouble as a good
man.
JACOB
I'm not that good. And I don't want
to be.
MARLENA
Don't say that.
JACOB
No, I don't. Good men don't wind up
with much in the end except their
goodness. Isn't worth much, is it?
MARLENA
(SADLY)
See? ... Look what we've done to
you already.
She touches Jacob's face gently. Until this moment, they
didn't realize how close they are to each other tracing
Jacob's face with her hands, as he leans in closer...
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Sweet Jacob.
JACOB
You deserve as good a life any
other girl.
MARLENA
Am I still a girl? I feel so old.
They kiss. They stop and silently acknowledge where this is
going. As they move towards a secluded spot, they continue to
kiss in between lines;
85.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
This can only be tonight. We have
to go back. Promise me you
understand.
JACOB
I understand.
MARLENA
Promise me you'll suffer.
JACOB
I already am.
MARLENA
Promise you'll look in my eyes the
whole time.
JACOB
I promise.
Jacob kisses her with his eyes locked onto hers...With
Marlena's back pressed against the entrance, Jacob reaches up
and locks the door. They sink to the ground.
Marlena sits inside Jacob's embrace on the ferry, her head
leaning against his chest - their hands entwined.
JACOB
If I had money, if I could take
care of you, would we be going
back?
MARLENA
You'd have to be a Rockefeller...
August would find me. He always
does.
JACOB
Have you tried to get away before?
MARLENA
Jacob you promised. You said you
understood it was only tonight.
JACOB
I know. I do....I'm sorry.
86.
Jacob walks Marlena out of the port to a waiting cab. They
stop a few feet from the cab. Jacob gives her all the money
in his pockets. Marlena looks at him as if for the last time.
MARLENA
Where were you when I was 17?
Jacob smiles. They kiss not wanting to let go. Marlena pulls
away and runs into the cab. Jacob watches it drive away.
Jacob reaches the circus. Everyone is asleep.
Walter is walking quickly back to the performer train. Jacob
follows, trying to reason with him. Throughout the scene,
they are looking out for Blackie's men and speaking low.
JACOB
Walter, please. Blackie and his men
only patrol the roustabout cars.
They don't work the performer
train. We can hide him easy until-
WALTER
(STOPS)
Until when? What are we going to do
with him? Shoot him like Silver
Star? Because that's what he is
Jacob. In a week, he won't be able
to move his legs at all.
JACOB
(THINKING FAST:)
He has a son in Pennsylvania. Near
Reading. We're playing there in
three weeks. That's all he needs.
Walter doesn't want to do this, but clearly can't say no.
WALTER
I was right about you. You're going
blow us all up...August got home
tonight before you and Marlena.
People are talking.
Walter stalks off leaving Jacob unhinged by the news.
WALTER (CONT'D)
I shouldn't be a clown. I should be
a Goddamn fortune teller.
89.
The cookhouse tent is divided into two sections by a curtain.
One one side: working men and the buffet table of food. It is
made up of benches and bare wood tables with salt and pepper
shakers.
The other side of the curtain is filled with performers. The
tables have a checkered tablecloth and flowers.
Marlena is sitting alone, drinking a cup of coffee. Jacob
approaches. He sits opposite her.
JACOB
Good morning.
MARLENA
Good morning Jacob, how are you?
Marlena smiles. Jacob senses others eavesdropping...but the
table is far enough away, so they can't be heard.
JACOB
I wanted to, uh...Is there any
chance I could speak with you
alone?
MARLENA
About what? Is something wrong?
JACOB
No, I...I just wanted to...Walter
said people are talking about what
happened...last night...
MARLENA
(LAUGHS)
Oh Jacob, champagne completely
overwhelms my senses..I always feel
the better for it when I abstain.
All I remember is getting pushed by
the crowd and then running and
getting a hole in my stocking. I
don't even know how I got home. I
don't remember a thing.
JACOB
Well, I want to apologize for--
90.
MARLENA
Ha,ha Jacob, it's silly of you to
apologize for my torn stockings.
You weren't even there.
Jacob is crushed by her reaction. Marlena maintains her
upbeat facade. August enters with his tray of food and
crosses to them. He is smiling like a man who has spent the
night having great sex.
August kisses Marlena right in front of Jacob. It is a long
sensual kiss...a holdover from their night together.
AUGUST
I slept like a baby after last
night. Thank you my darling.
MARLENA
August, please. We're in public.
Jacob understands his meaning and is quietly devastated.
AUGUST
(SITS)
Ah, nothing to be ashamed of. Man
and wife reuniting in the most
sacred of marriage places.
(BEAMING)
My Marlena has forgiven me. All's
well with the world again, right
Jacob?
(JACOB NODS)
That was quite an adventure last
night. I'm glad I didn't have to
bail you out. How did you get home?
JACOB
I don't know. I just ran.
AUGUST
(EATING)
How did you two get separated? You
were so close on the dance floor.
MARLENA
I told you, sweetheart. We got
pushed apart by the crowd. This
older married couple brought me to
the ferry.
AUGUST
I'd like to look them up and invite
them to the show free of charge...
(MORE)
91.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
...I'll even pay for their
transportation. I'd pay it a
hundred times over to anyone who
helped my wife to safety. Thank
goodness she had chaperones. If
anyone had harmed her, or even
touched her, there's no knowing
what I might do.
Jacob makes note of the implication. Marlena ignores it.
While Jacob coaches August from the sidelines, the company of
performers and workmen watch August command Rosie in Polish.
JACOB (V.O.)
...August said he would create an
act for Marlena and Rosie that
would have'em line up for miles...
August and the company are delighted when Rosie lifts her
foot...or walks forward, then backward..
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
His accent was awful but Rosie
obeyed without fail.
Marlena watches, full of excitement and praise for August. He
instructs Marlena where to stand. He commands Rosie who lifts
Marlena up with her trunk.
Everyone cheers and applauds. Those near Jacob pat him on the
back, grateful that he saved the circus. Jacob smiles.
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I was finally a part of them.
PRE-LAP - CHEERS AND APPLAUSE, AS ROSIE LIFTS MARLENA ONTO
HER BACK AND WE CUT TO:
Posters of ROSIE and MARLENA highlight the act COMING SOON!
Blackie and his men are covering up the Posters of other
circuses and town events.
JACOB (V.O.)
August could have given Barnum a
run for his money. He spent the
payroll money on expensive posters
promoting that act like it was
bigger than Ringling. And we sold
out every performance in every
town...
The workmen set up the circus with energy and renewed spirit.
August treating them with pats on the back of gratitude.
JACOB (V.O.)
..treating everybody first class,
spreading the word his Rosie act
would finally get the men paid..
Out of the darkness of the car, Rosie appears in the light,
being guided down the ramp by August, who gently pets her
trunk, whispering in her ear. Her ears flapping, she purrs
with affection. Jacob watches.
JACOB (V.O.)
It was when I saw Rosie purring
under his touch as if nothing had
happened between them, that the
worst thought occurred to me.
Marlena and Rosie exits the Big Top. We hear tumultuous
applause coming from inside. Jacob awaits them, as usual.
Jacob commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena off his back and
places her carefully on the ground. Jacob pets and commands
Rosie to follow him, but stops when:
MARLENA
I wonder if you could help me.
JACOB
Sure.
MARLENA
(PROFESSIONAL TONE)
I've planned a surprise for August.
He's been so wonderful, don't you
think?
(JACOB NODS)
Could you make sure Rosie is staked
in my tent after the show?
JACOB
No problem.
MARLENA
Thank you so much...Oh, and I'm
sure it would be nice for August if
you were there too.
Marlena turns and exits O.S. Jacob isn't sure what to think.
98.
Jacob and August continue beating each other as they roll out
into the crowd.
August's madness empowers him. He manages to overpower Jacob
in a choke hold. Jacob is losing consciousness.
Because of Marlena's screams - Earl and his men run to the
tent. Within seconds, they are pulling August off of Jacob.
August gets to his feet. His cool expression is even more
frightening as he re-enters Marlena's tent.
JACOB
LET ME GO!! HE'LL KILL HER!!!
102.
From inside the tent, they hear a crash. Marlena screams.
JACOB (CONT'D)
HE'S HURTING HER!!LET ME GO!
EARL
No he won't, kid. Come on.
Earl disperses the crowd that has gathered, which includes
Walter, who sees Jacob's bloodied face and goes to him.
FROM INSIDE THE TENT, THEY HEAR: Two soft thuds..then a
louder one...Then an unnerving silence.
EARL (CONT'D)
See, it's over. Can we let you go?
Jacob pants and nods. Earl and one of his men let Jacob go in
degrees, until he is standing up. Walter holds his waist.
WALTER
Come on Jacob. Walk away.
With Walter's help, he tears his eyes from the billowing flap
and walks away, passing rubes who watch with fascination.
JACOB ROLLS DOWN THE GRAVEL. BLACKIE AND HIS MEN JUMP OFF THE
TRAIN AND RUN TOWARDS HIM. JUST AS JACOB GETS TO HIS FEET,
THE MEN REACH HIM - AND BEGIN TO BEAT HIM.
WITH A SINGLE BLOW TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD, JACOB IS THROWN
INTO BLACKNESS.
A heavy rain pours. A bloodied, battered Jacob is semi-
conscious face down in a stream in the woods.
Jacob, his eyes almost swollen shut, wakes out of
unconsciousness. He looks up through blurred vision.
Through the trees, he can see A DISTANT FLICKERING RED LIGHT.
He stands. His knees buckle and he crawls out to the ground.
He stands again. And he walks out of the woods towards the
flickering light.
He stumbles and falls. He rises and fumbles forward...using
all his strength to get himself out of the woods.
Jacob struggles out of the woods to a clearing. Squinting
through the rain with swollen eyes, he sees:
108.
THE FLICKERING RED LIGHT IS A SIGNAL LIGHT ON A TRAIN TRACK.
He walks, with legs barely able to move. He climbs up the
gravel to the train tracks and begins to walk...
Jacob is walking on the train tracks in the direction of
Marlena's train. He has walked all night and into the day.
Jacob - beaten, bloodied, exhausted - looks up ahead:
THE BENZINI BROS. TRAIN and THE BIG TOP TENTS already set up.
It's pre-matinee. All the tents have been set up. The rubes
are filling the grounds. The midway is packed with people.
Nell is sitting by an open window fanning herself from the
heat when she sees:
Jacob wandering behind the back of the train where no one can
see him....Nell watches as Jacob tries to reach the train,
then falls unconscious.
Nell quickly brings Barbara to the window. Barbara sees Jacob
and immediately takes charge.
Camera tracks Barbara and the girls through the windows, as
they walk through the car...Barbara is organizing a plan with
the girls.
Nell and two Coochie Girls hold their robes closed as they
walk among the crowd. The Coochie girls head for Blackie and
his security men...They talk to them to distract them.
We see Nell approach Walter in full clown make-up doing
tricks with Queenie for the crowd. Nell whispers to Walter.
His expression tells us what we know.
109.
Barbara and the Tattooed Man sneak to the fallen Jacob with a
blanket. They turn him over, shocked by his condition.
Jacob's eyes open - he's delirious.
BARBARA
Poor Kid...Help me with him..
JACOB
(delirious to Tattoo man)
Don't you work the matinee?
TATTOOED MAN
Not today. I'm fading. I gotta re-
ink.
BARBARA
Don't talk.
Jacob nods. They cover him, pick him up and carry him off.
The train is moving fast. The rain has returned.
Jacob is making his way towards the back of the train, as it
moves forward. He holds the knife in his mouth...moving like
a tightrope walker over the wet train roof, as rain pours.
When he reaches the car's end, he takes a deep breath. With
all his strength, he leaps across the divide between the cars
and lands, clinging to the top rail, panting like a dog.
112.
He removes the knife from his mouth, having cut his lip. He
licks the blood back and replaces the knife, this time
keeping his lips retracted.
JACOB MAKES HIS WAY ACROSS SIX CARS...LEAPING FROM CAR TO CAR
BY LANDING ON THE ROOF, GETTING TO HIS KNEES THEN TO HIS FEET
Jacob leaps to the roof of Marlena and August's car. At this
moment, the train is making a curve.
Jacob climbs down over the side ladder. Beyond him, we see:
THE TRAIN IS TRAVERSING OVER A TRESTLE, FORTY YARDS ABOVE THE
BOULDERS OF A RIVERBANK ILLUMINATED BY MOONLIGHT.
Jacob jumps to the platform. He can see the rocky waters far
below the trestle. He catches his breath and waits, as the
train straightens out onto land again.
Jacob turns the knob of the door to the stateroom, slowly,
hearing a click, pausing, then opening it.
A sunny day. The circus is completely set up. Townsfolk,
rubes, are already buying tickets for the matinee.
JACOB (V.O.)
I waited almost til matinee time so
I could let myself be seen by as
many people from town.
Jacob opens the ring stock car and jumps out, holding
Queenie. He hasn't slept all night.
As he walks through the circus grounds, working men like Greg
and performers like Barbara are shocked to see him alive.
With a fool's courage, he brazenly walks past Blackie and his
men, cutting a path through performers and working men, right
up to August, who stands with Earl at his side. He is dressed
and ready for the matinee's performance.
Jacob stops and they exchange looks. August glances at
Queenie in Jacob's arms. He says nothing.
JACOB
I'm not here to cause any trouble.
I'm leaving.
AUGUST
Funny, I thought you already left.
JACOB
I'd like to say goodbye. To the
menagerie. Just a few minutes and
then I'll go.
August's eyes narrow. Earl waits for the outcome.
JACOB (CONT'D)
There's nothing more you can do to
me. Killing me'll be more trouble
than it's worth, now that the rubes
have seen me. You were right about
me from the start August, when you
said I wouldn't last...I can't
survive here...
(THEN)
I am nothing.
115.
August feels victorious and therefore benevolent.
AUGUST
Earl, take him to the menagerie.
Thirty seconds. Then escort him out
of my circus, into Altoona. And if
he comes back, you can shoot him,
as that is within our lawful rights
with regards to trespassers.
August walks away. Earl escorts Jacob to the menagerie. On
the way, they pass Barbara. Jacob pauses to hand Queenie to
her. She has tears in her eyes. Jacob continues with Earl.
As Earl escorts Jacob, they walk against the tide of audience
members walking to the Big Top entrance. Earl speaks low.
EARL
It's good you're going. They must
have known you got back on the
train last night. He tossed more
than half a dozen working men.
(MORE)
116.
EARL (CONT'D)
Kinkers never get tossed. Never. So
that was meant for you.
We hear the GOUNOD WALTZ starting in the Big Top.
EARL (CONT'D)
A few of the guys that got tossed
caught up with us again.
JACOB
Walter! Is he---?
Instantly, Earl's expression tells Jacob it's bad news.
Jacob's breathing almost stops as he listens;
EARL
Keep walking...They got tossed off
the trestle, if you can believe it.
Camel's head hit the rocks. He died
right away...
Jacob is heartbroken and dreads what he's about to hear. Earl
pauses for a beat...this part is harder to tell:
EARL (CONT'D)
...Walter...Walter's legs were
smashed up real bad..They had to
leave him.
(BEAT)
They don't reckon he lasted the
night.
Jacob is in shock. He can barely walk on...
EARL (CONT'D)
The ones that came back...Bill...
Grady.. I don't know how but, one
way or another they're taking down
August tonight.
Hearing this, Jacob stops to face Earl.
JACOB
Why are you telling me?
Earl can not find the words: it's clear the killing of these
men does not sit well with him.
SUDDENLY, WE HEAR THE BIG TOP MUSIC COME TO A CRASHING HALT,
FOLLOWED BY AN UNGODLY COLLISION OF BRASS THAT FINISHES WITH
A CYMBAL'S HOLLOW CLANG.
Earl shifts his focus - he's alarmed.
117.
JACOB (CONT'D)
Earl, what was that?
All the performers and work men on the midway are on alert.
WE HEAR THE BIG TOP BAND START PLAYING AGAIN...THIS TIME IT'S
"STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER".
EARL
Oh Christ! Oh Shit...
Earl runs back towards the Big Top.
JACOB
What is it?
EARL
The Disaster March!
Everyone with the show barrels towards the Big Top when Greg
appears amongst them and calls to Jacob:
GREG
JACOB! IT'S THE MENAGERIE!! THE
ANIMALS ARE LOOSE.
JACOB RUNS THROUGH THE PANICKED CROWD, THE GROUND RUMBLING
BENEATH HIS FEET...THE SOUNDS OF HOOVES ON HARD DIRT.
The polar bear is walking calmly down main street.
JACOB (V.O.)
It took days to round them up. Some
we never did get back.
THE NESCI BROS. CIRCUS TRAIN is pulling up alongside the
"ghost town" of the Benzini Bros - the ruins of the circus
are highlighted by strong winds blowing up dust and dirt.
JACOB (V.O.)
When the Nesci Bros. Circus showed,
we were officially belly up.
A MAN SCREAMS after unrolling a canvas and making a discovery
inside. A crowd forms. When Jacob reaches it, he sees:
BLACKIE, DEAD, WITH A MAKESHIFT GARROTTE AROUND HIS NECK.
121.
Jacob is walking Rosie, holding the Orangutan, with Bobo
atop Rosie. Through the wind and dust, they look for Marlena.
FROM OUT OF A WALL OF WIND BLOWN DUST APPEARS MARLENA AND SIX
OF HER BLACK AND WHITE HORSES. Marlena looks spent - shocked,
relieved, tearful, hopeful. She reaches Jacob.
MARLENA
What happens now?
JACOB
I wish I knew.
Marlena exhausted, eases into Jacob's arms. It's over.
WIDE ANGLE: Jacob and Marlena and their animals, as the giant
tent of the Benzini Bros. Big Top falls to the ground.
Charlie opens the door to greet a LOCAL COP.
CHARLIE
Hi Officer, can I help you?
COP
Yes, I'm hoping you can. An elderly
gentleman went missing from the
nursing home down the street. Staff
seems to think he came here.
124.
CHARLIE
We had a lot of folks from the home
today. But no, I haven't seen him.
The Cop peers past Charlie and sees Jacob.
COP
Excuse me, but who is that?
CHARLIE
(Pause, then)
Oh....that's my Dad.
The Cop is suspicious. Charlie covers:
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
He can't talk. Had a major stroke a
few years back. But he's doing
well. Ain't ya Pop?
Understanding the ruse, Jacob starts to play the part of a
stroke victim: he opens his mouth, his jaw quivers. He
reaches for his glass with a shaking arm. Charlie helps him.
Jacob holds out his tongue like a parrot's as Charlie helps
him drink. The Cop watches with a blank expression. Jacob
swallows and nods speechless, smiles and manages to drool.
Beat. The Cop wonders. Then, pulling out his card:
COP
OK, well, thanks for your time.
Here's my number in case you hear
of anything. Sorry to bother you.
The Cop exits. Charlie returns to sit opposite Jacob. They
consider this unspoken proposal:
JACOB
You sure about this?
Beat as Charlie pours another shot. Then:
CHARLIE
I wonder if we can get you into the
book of records. "Oldest man who
ever ran away with the circus".
JACOB
Nah, I'm not running away. Just
coming home.
125.
