                    (GINGERLY) Hey, Stuart.

                                        STUART

                    (CASUAL) Hi, guys.

                                        PHIL

                    I thought you d be kind of surprised 

                    to see us.

                                        STUART

                    (CALMLY)  I am.  I m stunned.  I took 

                      a sedative. (THEN) What are you doing 

                    here?

                                        HOLLY

                    We were worried about you.

                                        STUART

                    Haskell, you too?  You got off the 

                    couch, for me?

                                        HASKELL

                    What am I, made of stone?

    HE PULLS OUT A PRETZEL AND STARTS TO WATCH A HANDHELD TV.                                                                                      IV/S         
                                                                                      51.                                                                                                                          


                                        STUART

                    (STARING AT HOUSE) It so strange, 

                    looking through my living room window, 

                    seeing my wife with another man. (TO 

                    HOLLY) You knew about this didn t you?

                                        HOLLY

                    Yeah.  I did.

                                        STUART

                    Thanks for not telling me.  I m not as 

                    strong as people think.  I know I put 

                    up this macho front.

                                        PHIL

                    Yeah, you fooled us.

                                        STUART

                    Guess my marriage is really over.  It 

                    took me seeing it with my own two eyes 

                    to finally believe it.

                                        PHIL

                    Sorry, buddy.

                                        STUART

                    What am I going to do?  Lorna was my 

                    life.  She always said I was afraid of 

                    being alone.  And she was right.

                                        PHIL

                    You re not alone.  You ve got Haskell. 

                    (OFF HIS LOOK) And me, too.                                                                                      IV/S         
                                                                                      52.                                                                                                                          


                                        STUART

                    Don t worry.  It s only a matter of 

                    time until I chase away you guys, too.

                                        PHIL

                    Trust me, we re no day at the beach.  

                    Right, Haskell?

                                        HASKELL

                    We re unbearable.

                                        STUART

                    I m really touched you guys came all 

                    the way out here for me.  (THEN) 

                    Holly, where s your date? 

                                        HOLLY

                    It turns out you guys are my date.

                                        PHIL

                    You could do worse.

                                        HOLLY

                    Trust, me.  I have. 

                                        PHIL

                    C mon, Stuart, let s go home.  I ll 

                    let you make me a snack.

                                        STUART

                    How do you feel about zucchini 

                    fritters?

                                        PHIL

                    Forget the snack.

      THEY START TO LEAVE, BUT STUART DOESN T MOVE.                                                                                      IV/S         
                                                                                      53.                                                                                                                          


                                        PHIL (CONT D)

                    What?

                                        STUART

                    That grass could really use mowing.

                                        PHIL

                    No way.

                                        HASKELL

                    Forget it.

                                        HOLLY

                    I m wearing heels.

      THEY ALL LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

                                        PHIL

                    Okay.  Just this one time.
