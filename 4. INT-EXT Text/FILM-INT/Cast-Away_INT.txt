MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT
The forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING
BELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of
packages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and
sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.
Large mechanical
arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of
stations.
The packages surge and move.
The Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts,
where they're scanned by laser readers.
Picking up speed our
Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts.
The Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG.
GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT
A jumbled room jammed with computers and dominated by a HUGE
WALL GRAPHIC that charts hundreds of airplanes.
An Operator
moves a yellow strip labeled Jumbo 12 across the board.
ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE, RUSSIA
SERIES OF SHOTS
Night.
The manic activity has come to a dead stop.
Our two
Boxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small
Christmas tree.
Daylight now.
YURI, a Supervisor, saunters over, picks up
the Angel Box, sees an attractive co-worker, puts it down.
Night again.
A cat walks by the table where our two Boxes
have come to rest.
FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck is on the phone.
CHUCK
So it finally turned up...
Chuck hesitates for a moment, then looks at his watch.
CHUCK
I'll catch the sweep tonight.
FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT
Strapped into the jump seat behind the pilots, Chuck sleeps
with a mask over his eyes.
On his lap are some travel
brochures.
We see sailboats, we see the Florida keys.
FEDEX OFFICES - DAY
The staff has assembled near the loading dock.
Yuri the
station manager stands in front, occasionally catching the
eye of the attractive woman.
Chuck displays the FedEx box.
CHUCK
It took this test package thirty-two
hours to get from Seattle to St.
Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand
miles.
And then it took forty-one hours
to get from our warehouse in St.
Petersburg to here, a distance of,
what --
ALEKSEI
Six kilometers.
Four miles.
CHUCK
So how are we going to get this place
shaped up?
There's a muttered chorus of answers.
CHUCK
There's only one way.
We have to work
together.
Every one of us depends on
everyone else.
If one package is late,
we are all late.
If one truck misses the
deadline, we all miss the deadline.
Let's start by taking a look around.
Chuck leads his team through the sorting area.
Yuri squeezes
right next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard.
Chuck stops.
CHUCK
Here, this table is too far from the
wall.
Packages can slip down...like...
(pulls out a package from
behind a table)
...this.
He hefts the package, as if trying to guess what's inside.
CHUCK
What could be in here?
Let's say one of
you sent it.
Could be the closing papers
on your dacha, could be a toy for your
grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to
keep your mother alive.
I don't think
you want your mother's kidney to end up
behind a table.
The Sorter shoves the table against the wall.
Yuri says
something to the Translator.
TRANSLATOR
He says they have been very busy.
It is
hard to get good employees.
He is sure
you understand.
Wrong answer:
Chuck glances sharply at Yuri.
Aleksei
appears with a cellular phone.
ALEKSEI
Phone call.
Malaysia.
Chuck takes the phone, opening his BAG as he does so.
CHUCK
Kamal?
Right.
I'm getting them.
He pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin
board as he talks.
CHUCK
I'm looking at the blueprints of K.L.
right now.
The belts are too small for
the sorters.
Yeah, sometimes you never
see what's right in front of your face.
Look, it's --
Chuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse.
Then he notices something over by one of the trucks.
CHUCK
(to a loader)
Hold it!
Hazardous material needs its
own container!
(back on the phone)
-- three in the afternoon there, right?
That gives you five hours until the sweep
comes through.
Do the sort by hand
tonight, then put in a new feeder belt,
say a twenty-four incher.
Yes, overtime
is authorized.
He hangs up the phone.
He turns to the crew.
CHUCK
I'm going out on every route, I'm going
to work every job here, until I know
enough to help you.
That's it.
The crew disperses back to work.
Chuck and Aleksei walk
toward the office.
They've done this before.
Chuck lets a
corner of his command persona slip.
ALEKSEI
It's bad.
CHUCK
Worse than Warsaw.
ALEKSEI
Nobody remembers that.
CHUCK
The failures they remember.
It's the
successes they forget.
TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck rides next to LEV, the driver, a serious sort.
The
Translator squats on some boxes between them, trying to keep
his balance.
CHUCK
You sorted your packages before you left.
None of the other drivers did.
The Translator and Lev exchange a few words.
TRANSLATOR
He says he wants to be organized.
Do
packages in order.
Chuck looks at Lev with respect.
Right answer.
CHUCK
So how come the other drivers haven't
left yet?
The Translator asks Lev, who looks at him as if he is crazy,
then snorts an answer.
The Translator blushes.
TRANSLATOR
He says -- he is a very rude fellow --
CHUCK
Tell me exactly what he said.
TRANSLATOR
He says why don't his farts smell sweet?
Chuck grins.
Lev shrugs and says something else.
TRANSLATOR
He says that's just the way it is.
CHUCK
Lev -- it's Lev, right?
Listen, this is
FedEx.
We don't have to accept the way
it is.
HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
Chuck is watching CNN on the television, working his
PowerBook, and holding the phone.
CHUCK
No, keep trying.
A circuit's bound to
open up.
He hangs up.
CHUCK
(to himself)
Those damn Northern Lights.
Just then the lights go off.
For a moment everything is
darkness.
Then a small light switches on.
Chuck has a
headlamp on.
He gets up, heads into the bathroom.
We stay in the bedroom.
After only a moment, the light reemerges.
It heads over to
his bag.
We go with it.
Chuck takes out a roll of toilet paper.
The guy is prepared
for anything.
He goes into the bathroom, closes the door.
The lights come back on just as the phone rings.
We hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door.
Chuck charges out, holding up his pants.
Grabs the phone.
CHUCK
Hello?
Great.
Try it.
He waits.
We hear an ANSWERING MACHINE.
KELLY (V.O.)
This is Kelly, leave me a message and
I'll call you back soon as I can.
This is not what Chuck wanted to hear.
CHUCK
Kelly, damn, look, this is Chuck.
I'm
going to be a little late.
Well, more
than a little.
I had to go to Russia.
Couldn't be helped.
Could you call and
cancel the trip?
Look, we'll sail the
Keys in March.
It's better then anyway.
I'll be back before Christmas.
I
promise.
I think.
I mean, I will.
I,
uh --
He's stumbling over whether to say I love you.
CHUCK
I miss you.
He gently hangs up the phone.
FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - SERIES OF SHOTS
A surprised Yuri stands with the attractive assistant as
Chuck takes his clipboard away.
An even more surprised Lev stands by his truck as Chuck hands
the clipboard to him.
Chuck and the loaders clean off the graffiti.
Working alongside the sorters as the packages come in, Chuck
points out how to organize the inflow.
Chuck and Lev go over large maps of St. Petersburg with the
drivers.
FEDEX WAREHOUSE - ST. PETERSBURG - WEEK LATER
A big semi is being loaded with outgoing packages for the
airport run.
Aleksei, Chuck, Lev and the office executives
watch as containers are rolled on.
LEV
We've never got all the trucks in on
time.
Never.
Chucks looks at the clock.
CHUCK
Only one still left?
LEV
Route six.
Aleksei points at the big semi.
ALEKSEI
If we don't send it now we may miss the
connection in Paris.
The pressure in on.
Chuck looks around at his team.
CHUCK
(to Aleksei)
Give it five minutes.
FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG
The last truck enters and loading dock.
A few loaders move
toward it.
The executives all stand and watch.
But not
Chuck.
He's hands on.
CHUCK
Let's go.
He heads toward the truck and begins pulling off packages.
All the other executives follow him.
FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER
Led by Chuck, who works like a man possessed, they sort the
packages.
CHUCK
That's Bermuda.
Bermuda is in the
Memphis thru container.
No, Azores is
Europe.
He gestures at a closed container.
CHUCK
The Paris container.
Africa too.
Japan
goes to Memphis.
Chuck is everywhere, setting the example.
The whole office
is energized, working together.
FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER
They load the last container on the waiting truck.
Chuck
pounds the truck on the side.
Go.
The truck roars out of the loading dock.
Everyone takes a breath.
They are happy, proud.
LEV
We did it.
All of them.
CHUCK
Great job, everyone.
Remember, work
together.
We are like a hand...
They've heard this before.
Lev holds up his hand just before
Chuck does.
LEV
One finger, weak.
All fingers working
together, strong.
This makes Chuck smile.
CHUCK
You got it.
MD-11 - MOMENTS LATER
The pilots -- JACK and GWEN -- are going down their check
lists.
Chuck sticks his head in the cockpit.
CHUCK
I absolutely, positively, have to get to
Memphis overnight.
JACK
Can't help you.
Try UPS.
CHUCK
Jack -- gotta be something wrong with our
physicals, you keep getting certified to
fly.
Gwen, aren't you worried?
GWEN
Terrified.
CHUCK
We're on time, right?
JACK
On time, Chuck.
Chuck hands Jack and Gwen small packages.
CHUCK
Little present from the emerging
republics.
Another FedEx Road Warrior named STAN gets on.
He and Chuck
are obviously old hands at this.
CHUCK
What connects the world?
What makes it
one?
(they ignore him)
We do.
FedEx.
GWEN
You are such a lifer.
STAN
What do you expect, from the guy who
stole a kid's bicycle when his truck
broke down?
CHUCK
Borrowed.
I borrowed it.
The two of them strap in.
STAN
How'd it go?
CHUCK
Great.
Terrific.
The good guys won one
for a change.
He's finished a tough job.
He's relaxed and on his way home.
But Stan's his boss, and Stan's got bad news.
STAN
I had to bump your plane last night.
Chuck can't believe it.
CHUCK
You what?
STAN
It was fifteen minutes late.
The plane begins to taxi.
CHUCK
I checked the weather, you had the jet
stream, you could have made it up.
STAN
But I might not have.
CHUCK
Jesus.
I got it working... You have no
idea how hard it was... They're finally a
team...
STAN
I'm touched.
CHUCK
You fucked us over.
STAN
The point of FedEx, as I understand it,
is to make the damn connection.
CHUCK
I was making a point.
STAN
What?
Let Paris hold its plane?
Let
Memphis take care of it?
Let somebody
down the line clean up your mess?
CHUCK
Every person counts, every package
counts, that's my point.
STAN
You know what your problem is?
You just
see the packages in front of you.
You
don't see the big picture.
CHUCK
Baloney.
I do see the damn "big
picture."
MD-11 - NIGHT
Chuck is focused on his PowerBook with the screen away from
us, Stan is doing tai chi amidst the FedEx containers.
It
feels a little surreal, all those containers surrounding
them.
Stan comes over, looks at the image on the computer.
It's a
sailboat with some technical specifications under it.
STAN
I didn't know we had sailboats.
CHUCK
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
STAN
For all those vacation days you got
coming.
Chuck doesn't look up.
CHUCK
And never take.
STAN
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.
But I
couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
CHUCK
Forget it.
STAN
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't
attack unless he had everything just
right.
Finally Abe Lincoln came to him
and said, General, if you're not going to
use my army, could I borrow it for a
while?
So he gave it to Grant and Grant
just said, let's go.
CHUCK
I'm from Arkansas.
Tell me a story with
Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay
attention.
STAN
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.
We've
got to be bold.
You always want all your
ducks lined up.
But nothing's 100
percent.
It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49.
Hell, I'd take 40-60.
Then roll the
dice.
CHUCK
That's why you're a gambling man.
STAN
That's why I'm running foreign and you're
not.
That's why you're not married and I
am.
CHUCK
For the third time.
STAN
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes,
move on to tomorrow.
That's FedEx,
that's women, that's life.
Stan is so outrageous, Chuck can't help but laugh.
CHUCK
You are one sick fucker.
STAN
I'm trying to help you here.
There's
Warsaw, there's this --
CHUCK
This was nothing like Warsaw.
I held the
truck then minutes, it's not that big a
deal.
But apparently it is.
STAN
Look, that kids' bike, that's a guy
who'll do what it takes to get there on
time.
Live up to your legend, that's all
I'm saying.
Chuck reaches in his pocket, pulls out a bill.
CHUCK
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95
percent in a month.
STAN
Ninety five percent?
Just give me the
money now.
CHUCK
Talk is cheap.
Are we on or not?
STAN
We're on.
Chuck closes the PowerBook.
CHUCK
Let's go off-line.
They both take out their Valium -- the price they pay for
being such road warriors.
CHUCK
Two Valium...
Stan puts on his Walkman.
STAN
And the Stones.
Got to be.
It's their ritual.
Chuck puts headphones from his Walkman
over his ears, puts a mask over his eyes and leans his head
back onto the headrest.
We hear the Rolling Stones.
MD-11 - NIGHT
Stan stands smiling over Chuck.
STAN
Chuck.
Wake up Chuck.
Chuck pulls off the mask, takes out the earplugs.
He manages
a groggy grin.
STAN
You gotta do your own delivery from here.
SUPERHUB - NIGHT
Chuck walks through the extraordinary nexus of speeding
packages that intersect in intricate paths above and around
him.
This is the beating center of the FedEx world, the
crossroads, the deep core where everything connects.
In his
still-drugged state it all seems weirdly psychedelic.
A
Christmas tree goes by, then a huge plastic Santa Claus, both
with shipping labels.
CHUCK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck drops his briefcase and his bag.
The place is a jumble
of clothes, papers, books, etc.
In the living room is a tank
of tropical fish.
The water looks a little green.
No
bubbles are coming from the filter.
Uh oh.
Chuck walks to the tank.
He tightens a piece of tape that
holds the power cord onto the filter, taps the filter with
his finger, once, twice...the bubbles start again.
CHUCK
Damn thing.
But for a couple of fish floating on top of the tank it's too
late.
Chuck gets out his scoop and slowly skims them off.
CHUCK
Sorry, I'm really sorry.
CHUCK'S HOUSE - LATER
The CD is playing.
Chuck lies in bed, switches on the TV.
This is no good.
He doesn't care how late it is, he's going
to find Kelly.
LAB - NIGHT
Two doctoral candidates are playing Doom on their computers
when Chuck walks in.
CHUCK
You seen Kelly Frears?
One of them gestures toward a door.
GUY
Xerox machine.
HALLWAY - NIGHT
Chuck makes his way in the semi-darkness past rack after rack
of specimens in bottles.
Ahead of him we see the flashing green light of a Xerox
machine.
XEROX ROOM
The light goes off.
KELLY leans over the machine, bangs on
it.
KELLY
Sonofabitch!
CHUCK
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
Surprised, Kelly turns to greet Chuck.
KELLY
Chuck!
You're back!
She leaps into his arms.
KELLY
Your eyes are puffy.
Did you take Valium
again?
CHUCK
You smell like formaldehyde.
Kelly looks over at the Xerox.
KELLY
My last chapter's in there, and the damn
machine's jammed.
CHUCK
Let's take a look.
He lifts up the cover.
KELLY
How was Russia?
CHUCK
Cold.
KELLY
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know
how I hate that.
Did you get it fixed?
CHUCK
I thought I did.
He pries up one feeder, then another.
CHUCK
Got to follow the paper path here.
KELLY
Chuck, forget the Xerox.
So Russia
didn't turn out well?
But Chuck doesn't want to talk.
He's focused on the machine.
CHUCK
Used to you could fix these yourself.
She pulls him out of the machine.
He has toner on his
fingers.
KELLY
Chuck.
CHUCK
What do you want me to say?
That I
thought I'd done a great job but it all
turned to shit?
That I might as well
have gone sailing for all the good I did?
KELLY
Yeah, tell me.
Tell me all of it.
He suddenly looks really tired.
KELLY
You don't even know what time it is.
What day it is.
He turns to the Xerox in frustration.
CHUCK
And I can't fix this damn machine.
She looks at him.
KELLY
Come on.
KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
A tiny cubicle with a door.
She closes it, takes some paper
towels out of the desk, wipes his fingers.
KELLY
We're on the deck of the ketch, the air's
soft, the water's clear as crystal...
She licks the last bit of toner off his fingers.
CHUCK
That's carcinogenic.
She ignores that, stays with the fantasy.
KELLY
We're covered with suntan lotion and
sweat.
Our skin is so hot, it's
glowing...
And she comes closer to him.
KELLY
We could take a swim.
She's really close now.
CHUCK
On the other hand we could not take a
swim...
They squiggle themselves onto the desk.
LAB - NIGHT
Someone kicks the door shut.
Now the figures are in
silhouette, lit by the light in the office.
And then the light goes out.
EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
A large room dominated by an animated MAP OF THE WORLD.
Lights at various locations blink and flash.
Above the map
are a large Sign saying "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow" and two
huge digital Clocks -- one keeping time, the other a
countdown clock for that day's package sort at the SuperHub.
The operations team of FedEx sits around a large table.
Each
has on a headset.
BECCA TWIGG, the business-like senior vice
president of Operations, addresses questions to a man --
COLIN PARKER-BOWLES, the European operations manager -- on a
LARGE TV SCREEN in front of her.
"London" is superimposed on
the screen.
BECCA
So why was Milan late, Colin?
COLIN
One of the race horses coming from
Ireland got colic and had to be off-
loaded in Brussels.
That put the Jumbo
15, six hours late into Charles De
Gaulle.
Customs had difficulty locating
the dutiable items...
Colin continues as Chuck, out of breath, slips under the
screen and heads for the one remaining vacant seat -- across
from Stan.
Next to Stan is MAYNARD GRAHAM, an MBA systems
man.
Becca addresses a question over to Stan.
BECCA
Stan, can we get P&A; down to work with
Milan customs?
STAN
We're already on it.
BECCA
Good.
And let's look at our live animal
policy.
I don't think the income stream
justifies delaying IP product, especially
at Christmas.
Colin disappears.
A red light goes on.
Becca pushes a
button.
Another face comes on the screen.
"Oakland" appears
under the face.
BECCA
Stand by, Benson, we're still wrapping up
foreign.
She turns pointedly to Chuck.
BECCA
Chuck, thanks for joining us.
Status?
Chuck swallows nervously, tries to talk matter-of-factly.
CHUCK
Becca, as you know St. Petersburg was
consistently running late by six to ten
hours -- sometimes a full day or more.
I
replaced the station manager.
We
identified inefficiencies and worked out
a quality improvement plan I believe can
be met.
MAYNARD
You replaced the station manager with a
driver.
A local with no knowledge of our
systems.
BECCA
Shouldn't you have brought in someone
from Memphis?
Russia is priority one.
MAYNARD
James Pottinger is available.
The process is being ripped out of Chuck's hands.
He
struggles to get an answer.
STAN
He's a numbers cruncher.
Chuck's done
all the right things here...
Stan is doing his best to back up Chuck.
CHUCK
Jim's a terrific financial man, no
question.
But we can't always parachute
in from Memphis.
We've got to build up
our local staff.
MAYNARD
We've got to improve foreign on-time,
that's what we've got to do.
If this new
guy's so good, how come the very first
plane he sent missed the connection in
Paris?
Maynard knows how to go for the jugular.
Everyone looks at
Chuck.
CHUCK
We're building a new team here.
We got
every package on the truck for the first
time ever.
Success is the best teacher.
MAYNARD
I don't call missing the plane a success.
Everyone looks at Chuck.
KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY
Chuck enters as they keep talking.
Her house is cozy but
also where she works.
There's a computer, specimen jars, and
some terrariums with frogs inside.
A Christmas tree with
packages under it.
KELLY
You break four million packages last
night?
In the b.g. one of the packages by the Christmas tree is
starting to shake on its own.
CHUCK
Four four.
A record.
KELLY
You don't seem too happy about it.
CHUCK
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone
better.
KELLY
Let me guess, Russia came up?
Chuck's attention goes to the tree.
CHUCK
One of those packages just moved.
The package turns over, something darts out.
It's a puppy,
with a bow around its neck.
KELLY
Merry Christmas.
Chuck bends down to see the puppy.
CHUCK
Hey, look at you.
KELLY
I figure, if we could take care of a
puppy, we could, you know, take care
of --
A baby, she wants to say, but that's going a little fast so
she catches herself.
Chuck picks the puppy up.
CHUCK
He is a cute thing.
KELLY
He's your cute thing.
CHUCK
I can't even keep fish alive.
KELLY
A puppy's got a little more personality
than a fish.
CHUCK
And for you --
Chuck hands over his present.
KELLY
So do good things come in large packages?
Kelly opens Chuck's present -- a very large box.
It's a piece of luggage.
CHUCK
You know, for when you travel.
KELLY
For when I travel?
She can't believe it.
It's the exact opposite of what she
wanted.
KELLY
You should have got me something that
shows you want us to be together, not
apart.
Chuck is flummoxed.
Women read so much into things.
CHUCK
I wasn't sending a message.
I though
you'd like it.
Chuck's beeper goes off.
KELLY
You should have got me a ring.
He checks the number.
CHUCK
I have to go.
I'm on call for overflow
down at the Hub.
KELLY
A ring.
I wanted a ring.
CHUCK
You did?
She nods.
What to do?
CHUCK
Look, I love the puppy.
I love you.
But
I have to go.
KELLY
You can't go now.
CHUCK
I have to.
KELLY
You want to.
Chuck picks up the puppy.
CHUCK
What should we call him?
Or is it her?
How about Jango?
Kelly is having one of those moments when everything comes
clear.
KELLY
This isn't working out.
CHUCK
We're a little emotional here.
It's
Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
KELLY
"We're" not over-reacting.
CHUCK
Could you watch Jango?
KELLY
No.
CHUCK
I can't take him to work.
He hands her the puppy.
CHUCK
We'll talk about it when I come back.
It'll all be fine.
Really.
This is not a happy woman he is leaving behind.
KELLY'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
Chuck enters.
The tree and the presents under it are gone.
CHUCK
Kelly?
Kelly?
No answer, nothing but the sound of Jango, who begins yelping
in the kitchen.
KELLY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck picks up Jango, who is barricaded in the kitchen with
some food, some water, and some wet newspapers.
CHUCK
There.
There.
Easy now.
FARM HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Around the table are Chuck's brother ROGER, his wife MARY,
Amanda, and her TWO BROTHERS.
Mom brings in the turkey,
places it on the table, sits down.
They all hold hands and
bow their heads.
MOM
Chuck?
Chuck hesitates just a moment.
CHUCK
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts,
which we are about to receive, from thou
bounty, through Christ the Lord.
Amen.
ROGER
Let's eat.
FARM HOUSE - DAY
The grown-ups are cleaning up after Christmas dinner.
The
scene moves between the table, the kitchen counter, and the
refrigerator.
It's an old-fashioned kitchen, simply
furnished.
MARY
How's Kelly?
CHUCK
Great.
ROGER
Thought you were going to bring her.
CHUCK
So did I.
MOM
It seemed like she had such a good time
last time.
CHUCK
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
MARY
Jennifer's still down at the post office.
And she's still got that crush on you.
ROGER
And she's still got those --
MARY
Roger.
ROGER
You should have stuck around.
This is an old, sore subject.
CHUCK
Look, I help take care of the place.
You
got my check, didn't you Mom?
MOM
That new roof, that's your doing.
ROGER
You're just allergic to farming, that's
what dad said.
Can't stand to be alone.
Can't stand to be in one place.
Can't
stand the sight of...blood.
He drops the turkey giblets into the trash.
MARY
Roger's going to put chickens in here.
Chuck can't believe this.
CHUCK
Come on Roger, this is dad all over
again.
You already did beefalo,
chinchillas, and what was that, ostrich?
They chased Mom around the yard, sprained
her hip.
Mom goes to the freezer and takes out some frozen
strawberries.
MOM
It wasn't that bad, dear.
MARY
You can't make a living out of this
place.
We tried.
CHUCK
But chickens?
ROGER
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita,
up from twenty seven in 1960.
Going to
pass beef.
Chicken's global.
No
religious taboos.
You don't see your
Hindus and your Muslims boycotting
poultry.
CHUCK
True enough.
No sacred chickens nowhere,
so far as I know.
MOM
Roger's working at Tyson's now.
Mom mashes the block of frozen strawberries with a fork to
separate the strawberries from the ice.
CHUCK
Really?
ROGER
Come on down to the plant.
It's state of
the art.
We're doing for chickens what
FedEx did for the delivery business.
CHUCK
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
Roger grins at him.
This is just how they are.
ROGER
I'll try to remember that.
MOM
Dessert.
They all sit down.
Mom brings the slushy frozen strawberries
to the table, squirts on some Reddi-whip.
Looks pointedly at
Chuck.
MOM
Speaking of hatching, I could sure use
some more grandchildren.
Not a timely topic with Chuck.
CHUCK
Mom, this is a farm.
We've got real
strawberries growing outside, we've got
real cream.
MOM
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.
We bring
out the store bought.
Chuck takes a bite, winces a little as the cold strawberries
hit his teeth.
FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
In his boyhood room, we see Chuck's laptop, which is hooked
up to the internet FedEx homepage.
All around him are models
of boats and planes, maps, pictures of far-off places.
The
room of a boy who always fantasized about getting away.
Chuck is beside it, slumped down on the desk.
Asleep.
FEDEX OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY
Chuck enters his office, on the go.
His assistant LESLIE is
waiting for him.
CHUCK
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
LESLIE
And how was your Christmas?
CHUCK
Terrific.
Yours?
She nods, used to this.
CHUCK
And get me in to the dentist.
My tooth's
acting up.
Stan enters.
STAN
Malaysia's tanking.
We're meeting in ten
in operations.
CHUCK
Right.
(to Leslie)
Get me everything on Indonesia, New
Guinea, all the way to Australia.
OPERATIONS ROOM - MINUTES LATER
Chuck, Leslie, Stan and another executive from the meeting
named DICK are gathered around the TV screen.
A squawk box
is on the table.
CHUCK
Kamal?
Kamal?
Can you hear us?
The box squawks.
The TV screen rolls an imperfect image.
DICK
Can't we get this working?
A Technician is fiddling with the TV set.
TECHNICIAN
Trying.
CHUCK
Kamal, you're breaking up.
Can you hear
us?
VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
Kamal is not here.
CHUCK
Who is this?
Where is Kamal?
VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
CHUCK
What's going on down there?
VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
Kamal is not here.
We are very defused.
CHUCK
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
The squawk box hums and crackles.
Nothing.
Chuck turns to
the Technician.
STAN
We got Telex, e-mail?
TECHNICIAN
Sure.
Just not getting any answers.
Chuck turns to Leslie.
CHUCK
When's the next Jumbo?
LESLIE
The regular flight is scheduled for oh
three hundred tomorrow.
CHUCK
Anything else?
LESLIE
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an
hour, goes through Sydney.
STAN
Maybe you should get your ducks lined up
first.
Chuck looks over at Stan.
CHUCK
Call Operations.
Get me on it.
And Stan is impressed.
FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT
Chuck enters the cockpit, where two different pilots are
going through their checklists.
Chuck repeats his familiar
patter.
CHUCK
Al -- gotta be something wrong with our
physicals, you keep getting certified to
fly.
John, aren't you worried?
JOHN
I disconnected his controls.
He only
thinks he's flying.
Chuck settles into his seat.
CHUCK
You're on your way home, Al?
Al has an Australian accent.
AL
Right.
Down home, down under.
CHUCK
We're on time, right?
AL
On time, Chuck.
FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT - HOURS LATER
Settled into the jump seat, Chuck finishes up his notes on
his PowerBook and begins his flight ritual.
He puts in his ear plugs and takes out his Valium.
He
swallows one, then thinks, and swallows two more.
Then he
turns on his Walkman to the Rolling Stones, puts the mask
over his eyes, and, as usual, goes to sleep.
DISSOLVE TO:
FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT
The plane is SHAKING badly.
HEAR frantic, garbled radio
talk.
Chuck stirs, struggles to his feet, drowsy and
drugged.
FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV
Everything is hazy, out of focus, as it was in his earlier
drugged condition.
But this is real haze.
SMOKE.
And the
cabin also TWISTS and TILTS.
Chuck tries to steady himself against the wall.
This is
nightmarish.
Is this really happening?
FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV - COCKPIT
The pilots wrestle with the controls.
They have their life
jackets on.
John glances back at Chuck, his face floating in
a cloud of fear.
FEDEX PLANE - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck struggles to put on his life jacket.
The plane is
VIBRATING VIOLENTLY.
He can't get the straps straight.
He
is KNOCKED against one wall, then another, then to the floor.
Chuck tries to blow on the mouth tubes for his life jacket.
Can't do it!
Puff.
Puff.
Shit!
John motions frantically
for Chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket.
Chuck fumbles for them.
Huge palettes shift and groan, one BREAKS FREE, banging
violently against the side of the plane, spilling out its
boxes.
Then it swings and KNOCKS Chuck on the head!
He goes
down!
GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER
A CONTROLLER mans the global operations desk.
His SUPERVISOR
stands behind him, sipping some coffee.
The mood is eerily
calm.
An assistant moves Plane Locator Cards on a giant
board.
CONTROLLER
Jumbo 14 is overdue in Sector K.
SUPERVISOR
Where are they?
Another CONTROLLER tracks a giant computer screen.
CONTROLLER 2
Somewhere east of Port Moresby.
Guam is
getting a signal but no location.
Maybe
the GPS is out.
The signal flashes, but is strangely still compared to the
others, which are moving.
FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT
Chuck is semi-conscious and bleeding from the head.
John
pulls the inflators on Chuck's life jacket, which fills with
a WHOOSH!, sending Chuck's arms out to the sides.
Al
struggles with the LIFE RAFT.
It's all blurred, frantic,
terrifying.
GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER
The Controller is speaking mechanically into the microphone.
CONTROLLER
Guam, I need a fix on Jumbo 14.
CAVE - DAY
He dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave.
But where
the fire had flickered, there is only a pile of wet black
ashes.
THE FIRE IS OUT.
CAVE - NIGHT
Chuck lies on the floor of the cave, shivering in the
darkness as the rain falls.
His fire is out, his tooth is
killing him, he can't escape.
CAVE - THAT DAY
The sun is setting on his darkened cave.
The soccer ball
sits in the corner by the black cold ashes of what was once
his fire.
Chuck carves a bit of coconut meat, takes a bite and winces
as the meat hits his sore tooth.
He tosses the shell on a
small new pile of shells.
Chuck shakes out the last half Tylenol tablet.
He puts the
tablet in his mouth, then takes a sip out of his coconut
canteen.
When the water hits his tooth that hurts too.
CAVE - MORNING
Chuck mixes a mash of breadfruit and coconut.
He tries to
pack the tooth with the mash, but it's so sensitive that even
this hurts.
He pounds the floor of the cave in frustration.
CAVE - LATER
Chuck holds a stone chisel and his hammer stone.
He
positions the chisel against his inflamed tooth.
But the
thought of what he is about to do is too frightening.
He
lowers the chisel.
CHUCK
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
CAVE - LATER
Determined, Chuck hold the stone chisel again.
He raises it
slowly to his mouth and picks up the hammer stone.
CHUCK
No pain, no gain.
He brings the hammer down hard on the chisel!
The screen
goes BLACK as Chuck's SCREAM continues UNDER.
FADE IN:
CAVE - THAT AFTERNOON
Chuck enters with the fish.
We are greeted with the well-
ordered lair of a primitive stone-age man.
Clam shell spirals weave in and out around the fire hole.
Strips of eel jerky and fish hang drying from racks.
Tools are lined up neatly:
digging sticks, stone hammers and
saws, spears neatly hafted onto shafts, drills, awls.
Bits
and pieces of feathers, skins, bones, rags, leaves -- are all
neatly arranged.
Strings and cords hang from hooks.
Coconut
bowls and cooking rocks form a small kitchen.
A raincoat and
rain-hat woven of palm fronds is neatly draped over a frame.
Evocative pieces of driftwood decorate the room.
A wind
chime of obsidian flakes sways gently.
The watch hangs on a
stick.
The Angel Box has the place of honor on one side.
On the
other side the Wilson soccer ball rests on a throne of rocks.
Seaweed has been placed on the ball as hair.
Clam shells
have been stuck on for eyes, other shells form a mouth.
A
tube shell and conch form a pipe.
CAVE - FIRE - NIGHT
The fish are being smoke under a palm frond.
Eel skins hang
from sticks, roasting.
Chuck sits by the fire, hafting a
stone knife onto a wooden haft.
He ties some fiber to a stick, then braids it into string,
using both hands and his mouth for the three strands.
He ties the string tightly around the shaft.
He does his
work automatically.
CAVE - NIGHT - LATER
Chuck eats some fish and some mashed breadfruit.
He chews
each bite, his eyes in distant focus.
The firelight flickers
on his face.
CAVE - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck enters the cave, picks up the ball and heads out.
CAVE - LATER
Chuck wraps his foot in bandages.
CAVE - LATER
Chuck's face is sweaty.
He looks down at his foot.
It is
red, swollen, infected.
He stands up, tries to put some
weight on it.
The pain is intense.
Chuck sticks the scalpel onto some coals to sterilize it.
He
holds it over his foot, takes a breath, then jabs in into the
wound.
The pain is intense.
Chuck passes out.
CAVE - NIGHT
Chuck stirs, takes a drink, weakly tosses on another log, and
collapses back on the floor.
CAVE - DAY
Chuck wakes up, trembling, shaking, wet with sweat.
He
staggers up.
His shadow sways on the wall of the cave.
He
struggles to get another log on the fire.
He squints at his
only companion, the soccer ball.
CHUCK
Help me, Wilson...
He collapses again.
CAVE - NIGHT
Chuck stirs and squints his eyes.
He takes a drink of water.
He is feeling better.
He puts another log on the fire and
slowly begins to chew on some breadfruit and dried fish.
CAVE - DAYS LATER
Chuck has the beginnings of an artist's studio.
Several
large clam shells hold paint.
A few egg shells are lined up.
Brushes have been made from roots and feathers.
Chuck covers his hand with paint and makes a handprint on the
wall of the cave.
He stands back and looks at it.
CAVE - DAY
He chews some berries, then holds his hand against the wall
of the cave and spits a dark blue mist around it.
When he
takes his hand away, the silhouette of his handprint remains.
CAVE - DAY
With the Angel Wing Box as a model, Chuck dips one of his
feather brushes in paint, and make a tentative line on the
wall of the cave.
He works hesitantly, rubs off a line,
tries again.
CAVE - NIGHT
Chuck is finishing his first figure, a crude portrait of a
man -- himself?
Hard to tell.
He examines his work.
He
takes some shells and sticks them on as eyes.
Chuck picks up Wilson, thinks.
CHUCK
You old airhead, you need a makeover.
He takes some charcoal out of his fire and draws eyebrows on
the ball.
Then, he mashes some berries, dips his fingers in
the juice, and makes lips.
He sticks shells on with clay for
eyes.
Then he looks at the face.
CHUCK
Wilson, you bad!
He sits back and regards his companion.
He gestures around
the cave at the new paintings.
CHUCK
What do you think?
But Wilson doesn't have an opinion.
CHUCK
You don't share much, do you?
Idly Chuck takes down the Angel Box.
CHUCK
I guess I know how Kelly felt.
For a long time he studies the wings on it.
With a stick, he
tries to draw a similar wing on the dusty floor of the cave.
Dissatisfied, he wipes it away.
He looks at the Angel Box.
Casually he reaches over and cuts it open with a stone knife.
Inside he finds two bottles of green salsa.
And a letter.
He reads over it.
CHUCK
You said our life was a prison.
Dull.
Boring.
Empty.
I can't begin to tell
you how much that hurt.
I don't want to
lose you.
I'm enclosing some salsa, the
verde you like.
Use it on your sticky
rice and think of home.
Then come home
-- to me.
We'll find the spice in our
lives again.
Together.
I love you.
Always.
Bettina.
Visibly moved, Chuck puts down the letter.
CHUCK
He never got it.
CAVE - DAY
As the rain pours down outside, Chuck studies the sodden,
ruined photograph of Kelly, which is really only a gray mess.
CHUCK
She's probably found someone else.
I
would have.
Chuck dips his finger into one of the bowls of colors and
streaks it slowly across his face.
To exorcise his
loneliness, he will paint on the most expressive canvas there
is:
his own body.
CHUCK PAINTING HIMSELF - MONTAGE
Close-up on scarred fingers, as they paint on Chuck's face
and body.
Color on skin.
Tight dramatic shots of Chuck
being transformed.
Chuck takes white paint and covers his hand.
Then he presses
it into his chest and makes a handprint.
He draws a yellow
spiral on his leg, then takes red and makes jagged lightning
bolts on his chest on either side of the hand.
WATER
Shimmers in a gourd.
Chuck's face swims into focus.
It has
been painted white.
Looking at himself in the reflection, he
dots on blue stars with dark blue from squid ink.
CAVE - NIGHT
Chuck is drawing with a purpose now.
And we see what he is
working on.
The plans for a raft.
CAVE - NIGHT
Chuck is making a list of what he needs.
He works intently.
CHUCK
Canteens.
Sea anchor.
Got to weave
rope.
Spears.
A sail.
CAVE - NIGHT
He sews dresses together with handmade fiber string.
CAVE - NIGHT
He weaves videotape together to form a sea anchor.
CAVE - DAY
Chuck constructs a water collection device with some FedEx
boxes, some plastic weighted with a stone.
Explains it to
Wilson.
CHUCK
Now I'm hoping that if this is airtight
I'll get condensation down here, a cup or
so a day.
If I'm careful it should be
enough.
CAVE - NIGHT
Chuck writes on the wall.
CHUCK
If I never return, know that here lived
Chuck Noland for four years.
I drew
these paintings.
I made these marks.
And then I took my fate in my own hands
and set forth to save myself, God
willing.
U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL - HAWAII
A cavernous hanger-sized ward brightly lit and filled with
row upon row of hospital beds, each with its table, side
chair, and lamp, each with a stainless steel bedpan and
neatly folded sheets and blankets stacked ready to use, and
each completely empty.
Except for one.
And on that bed we see Chuck, in a blue hospital gown.
An IV
drips into his arm.
He plays idly with the remote control of
the bed.
He raises the head, then the foot.
He pushes
another button and the knee rest bends the bed again.
A DOCTOR enters, carrying a thick chart.
Chuck gives him a
big manic grin.
Malcolm MacDowell in "A Clockwork Orange."
CHUCK
My favorite doctor.
What's the verdict?
DOCTOR
Under the circumstances your overall
health is good.
Those salt water boils
you picked up on the raft are ulcerated,
but they're healing nicely.
He checks his blood work records.
DOCTOR
Hemoglobin's 10.8 -- you're anemic,
that's why we're giving you iron.
Potassium's low -- we're giving you an
electrolyte solution with your IV.
Sodium's over 150, way too high.
You may
experience swelling in your extremities
as you rehydrate and discharge the salt.
In spite of your dietary deficiencies
there's no sign of mental deterioration.
Chuck has been trying not to laugh.
Now he can't stop
himself.
DOCTOR
What's so funny.
Chuck can't seem to help laughing at everything.
CHUCK
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still
ache?
DOCTOR
Dehydration.
Vitamin deficiency.
Protein deficiency.
Any or all of the
above.
CHUCK
All I ate was fish.
That's solid
protein.
DOCTOR
Protein digestion is very costly in water
usage.
CHUCK
Which I didn't have.
DOCTOR
And fish are very low in fat, which is
energy inefficient.
So you're going to
burn up your own cells no matter how much
you eat.
Luckily you ate the eyes and
pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C,
so you didn't get scurvy.
Chuck laughs again.
CHUCK
I am one lucky guy.
DOCTOR
Your body chemistry and your exposure to
the elements would normally lead to
irritability, depression, anxiety,
periods of self-reproach.
It's almost
like schizophrenia.
Different sides of
your personality might come to life,
speak out, act out.
CHUCK
But all that's behind me.
I'm fine now.
He starts to laugh again.
DOCTOR
If you say you are.
CHUCK
I most definitely say I am.
DOCTOR
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the
Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
Chuck stifles his laughter.
CHUCK
Yes, yes he did.
DOCTOR
You are aware of the potential
disruptiveness on your loved ones when
you return to your old life?
CHUCK
Not to mention on me.
The laughter again.
Unsettling.
DOCTOR
You sure you don't want some counseling?
Chuck gives his biggest smile.
CHUCK
Doc, I'm not on the island.
I'm not on
the raft.
I'm alive.
I'm so glad to be
back, I can't tell you.
I just want out
of here.
DOCTOR
Well, when that IV runs out, you're
through with us.
Just the dentist
tomorrow.
HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER
Rolling his IV, Chuck walks very slowly out of the ward.
Every step is an effort.
PHONE CUBICLE - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER
A small windowless room with only a desk and a phone, lit by
a fluorescent lamp.
Chuck is listening to the phone ring.
Kelly answers.
KELLY (V.O.)
Hello.
Chuck is overcome for a moment, can't say a word.
KELLY (V.O.)
Hello?
Hello?
For some reason he can't keep himself from laughing.
He
covers the mouthpiece and laughs.
And then we hear a dial tone, harsh, mechanical, final.
PHONE CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER
We hear a faint persistent hum.
Chuck looks around, trying
to locate the sound.
He looks up, focuses on the fluorescent
light, that background sound he can no longer tune out, then
picks up the phone again.
PHONE CUBICLE - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck's on the phone again.
CHUCK
Two Valium and the Rolling Stones.
That
ring a bell?
There's a long silence.
Then we hear Stan's voice.
STAN (V.O.)
God damn!
God damn!
Chuck, it's you!
CHUCK
It's me.
STAN (V.O.)
You're fucking dead!
CHUCK
I'm most definitely not dead.
And as I
recall, you're the sick fucker.
Chuck begins to laugh, a little too loud, a little too
shrill.
He's on a high.
DENTIST - NEXT DAY
An attractive DENTAL TECHNICIAN with an Australian accent
cleans Chuck's teeth with an ultrasound device.
She's close,
very close.
Chuck looks up at her.
She looks really good.
She smiles at him, then touches the gap where he knocked out
his tooth.
TECHNICIAN
You sure you don't want to have the
implant done here?
We do quite good
work.
Chuck shakes his head:
no.
She scrapes behind his front
teeth.
TECHNICIAN
Hmmm, you do have such a lot of tarter
behind these front incisors.
A little
wider, please.
Chuck opens his mouth even further.
The technician talks on
in the self-absorbed way dental technicians sometimes do,
that constant babble of human contact which Chuck has not
heard for four years.
TECHNICIAN
Anyway, so the second prosthetic foot
worked better, but he still couldn't
drive his new Cortina, it being a
standard shift, if you follow me.
Chuck nods.
I follow you.
TECHNICIAN
But would he hear of me driving him
around?
Not on your bloody life.
Rinse
please.
Chuck does.
Stan bursts into the room.
STAN
Chuck!
God damn!
Chuck struggles out of the chair.
STAN
God damn.
God damn.
God damn.
They are both almost overcome.
Stan holds Chuck by the
shoulders and looks at him.
STAN
You're alive, you're fucking alive!
Chuck laughs, thrilled to see Stan.
CHUCK
I beat the odds!
STAN
You beat 'em to shit, pal!
Jesus!
TECHNICIAN
I still need to floss you.
Stan notices the technician.
STAN
Hello.
CHUCK
This is Amber.
Her boyfriend lost his
foot in a shark attack.
He says this with an absolute straight face, holding back the
laughter with great effort.
Instantly there's this
connection again between him and Stan.
TECHNICIAN
Ex-boyfriend.
STAN
Really.
And he and Chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse of
their shared unspoken irony.
STAN
Uh, there's somebody out here who wants
to see you.
Chuck stares sharply at him.
Kelly?
Stan nods, but there's
something he wants to say.
STAN
She thought you were dead.
We all did.
That's not all Stan wants to say.
But Chuck is limping out
the door.
DENTIST - WAITING ROOM
Typical dentist waiting room.
Chairs, tropical fish tanks,
magazines, a few waiting patients...and Kelly, looking
nervous.
Slowly and painfully Chuck enters.
He's quite a sight.
She
stands up.
There's a long moment where they look at each
other.
Then she comes into his arms.
Holds him tight.
She's part
laughing, part crying.
KELLY
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
CHUCK
Hey...hey...it's okay!
Chuck is happy, he's still riding the high.
KELLY
You're so thin.
Am I hurting you?
Well, maybe a little, but who cares?
He hasn't been hugged
or barely touched in so long.
CHUCK
No...no...feels good...
She disengages, looks at him with that old smile.
KELLY
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
CHUCK
A few things came up.
Or went down.
He meets her gaze, looks her over with a smile.
CHUCK
You look...wonderful.
I like your hair.
He notices the ring on her hand.
KELLY
I got married.
CHUCK
I thought you might have.
KELLY
I would never --
CHUCK
I know.
KELLY
If I'd known you were alive --
CHUCK
I would have done the same thing.
His responses come so quick.
Chuck seems blissfully sure of
himself.
KELLY
I didn't want to.
It just happened.
One
day Gary was there.
He took care of
everything.
He took care of me.
I was a
mess.
CHUCK
You have any children?
Kelly nods.
CHUCK
Got a picture?
Kelly fishes for a photo, shows it to Chuck.
It's a little
girl with a dog.
KELLY
Her name's Hannah.
CHUCK
Is that Jango?
KELLY
No, this is Jack.
Jango was hit by a UPS
truck.
Can you believe it?
Chuck laughs.
It is funny, sort of.
CHUCK
Life's just one big joke after another.
Stan appears, takes in the scene.
The few patients waiting
are edged into the corners, trying to look occupied with
something else.
STAN
How about we go somewhere else?
CHUCK
Want to see my raft?
FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT
Chuck and Stan ride on the plane.
Chuck is coming down off
his survival high.
He has the Angel Wing FedEx package with
him.
STAN
When I first showed up, I thought you'd
lost your fucking marbles.
CHUCK
I never thought it would end.
Then it
did.
It was so great to be saved, I
couldn't stop laughing.
Stan pulls a flask out of his bag.
STAN
You need a drink.
Stan takes two glasses from his bag, rests them on a FedEx
container, and pours the whiskey.
CHUCK
For years my only drinking buddy was a
soccer ball.
Wilson.
Stan hoists his glass.
STAN
To Wilson.
CHUCK
To Wilson.
Now's when Stan gets to the question he's been wanting to
ask, that Kelly wanted to know, that we all want to know.
STAN
So, what's it all about?
Chuck stares at him.
STAN
You've been over the line and you came
back.
You've been saved, hallelujah!
CHUCK
Hallelujah.
Stan looks over at him.
STAN
I'm serious.
The burning bush, the big
picture, the words in neon...
CHUCK
What's it all about?
It's about being so
thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to
suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what
it's about.
Stan sits back, repulsed but relieved.
STAN
Do what it takes.
That's what I always
told you.
He pours another drink.
STAN
To life.
Fuck 'em if they can't take a
joke.
CHUCK
To life.
STAN
That's all there is.
CHUCK
Believe me I know.
He takes a sip of his drink, just savoring it, thinking.
CHUCK
But it's not being bold or being in the
game or rolling the dice.
All those things Stan used to tell him.
CHUCK
When I was going crazy, on the raft, I'd
argue with myself about everything.
Because everything had a price.
To get
anything -- a sip of water, a little
corner of shade, an hour's sleep -- I had
to let go of something else.
And then I
could never get it back.
He thinks some more.
CHUCK
You don't win or lose.
You win and lose.
He looks out the window.
CHUCK
You win and lose.
And Chuck has.
Big time.
CAR - MEMPHIS FREEWAY
We are assaulted by a surge of light, motion, activity.
Snaking lines of traffic in both directions, big overpasses,
the city rising beyond.
Stan drives with a certain aggressiveness.
Chuck looks out
at the traffic, at all the activity, at the vast intricate
anthill of humanity going everywhere and nowhere.
CHUCK
Take your time.
STAN
What?
CHUCK
That's what it's about.
STAN
Being patient.
Don't rush things.
I get
it.
He swerves into another lane.
CHUCK
Not just that.
Take your time.
Use it.
Live it.
STAN
Deep, real deep.
He grins, cuts across to the exit.
STAN
So where to?
The office?
The hotel?
The beach?
Chuck stares at him.
Are you kidding?
STAN
What, then?
CHUCK
Deliver this package.
Then, I dunno.
STAN
(re: the package)
You want that delivered, we'll deliver
it.
That's what we do.
CHUCK
I need to do it.
STAN
Finish what you started.
You haven't
changed, Chuck.
It's still you.
Right.
CHUCK
You want to help, help me find the woman
who sent this.
OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY
Stan and Chuck are in the office of a TECHNICIAN who is
working away at his computer.
The Technician pulls the bar
code from the Angel Wing FedEx box up on his computer screen.
TECHNICIAN
Okay.
After three years the PTR reverts
to tape storage, which is okay because we

CHUCK
What about the sender?
TECHNICIAN
Sure.
Bettina Peterson.
Marfa, Texas.
Let's run a current check.
He works some keys, waits.
TECHNICIAN
Hmmm.
Durango, Colorado; Asheville,
North Carolina, then...canceled her
account.
CHUCK
Can you find her?
TECHNICIAN
You're looking at a Level III search.
For your Level III, you gotta have E-4
authorization.
I don't have it.
STAN
I do.
He holds out a badge.
TECHNICIAN
Okay, let's let it rip.
He starts to pull up the data.
CHUCK
Thanks.
For everything.
STAN
No sweat.
CAFE - NIGHT
Chuck draws on a paper place mat as he waits for his meal at
a counter.
Above the counter the television plays.
ANNOUNCER
And here's more from Dingo Dodd, our
Australian correspondent, on the
extraordinary story of Chuck Noland, the
modern Robinson Crusoe.
The waitress sets a plate down in front of Chuck, turns to
watch.
On the TV we see an Australian correspondent standing on
Chuck's beach.
DINGO DODD
Shark infested waters!
A deserted
island!
Surrounded by reefs!
Accessible
only by helicopter!
For four years Chuck
Noland survived here alone, eating fish,
coconuts and clams, his only companion a
soccer ball.
Chuck is staring at the screen, seeing his cave, seeing all
those years.
DINGO DODD
I'm now in Chuck's cave where he passed
the lonely nights, painting on the walls
like some prehistoric caveman.
What did
Chuck feel?
These paintings tell the
story, but only Chuck knows what they
mean.
And he's not talking.
On the screen we see a photograph of Chuck.
The waitress looks over at Chuck.
The other clients look at
him too.
CHUCK
Check, please.
The waitress comes over.
WAITRESS
No charge, honey.
But could you just
sign that place mat for me?
Chuck looks down at his doodling.
Hesitates.
Then signs his
name.
TYSON'S CHICKEN - ARKANSAS - DAY
Thousands of chicken carcasses hanging on hooks circle
through the huge processing plant, a vast structure on the
scale of the SuperHub or the Hospital.
Chuck's Mom, dressed in white with a hairnet, enters a
windowed office in the b.g.
Through the window we see her
hug Chuck.
TYSON'S CHICKEN - OFFICE - ARKANSAS - DAY
We are in the office now.
Chuck's Mom's eyes are moist.
CHUCK
When'd you start working here?
MOM
Roger got me on.
I wasn't doing
anything, and -- but you're back, you're
really back.
I would have come to
Memphis, but --
CHUCK
I wanted to come here.
FRAME HOUSE - ARKANSAS - DAY
Chuck eats a Southern fried drumstick.
The table is full of
home-cooked food.
MOM
Have some more potato salad.
Chuck gestures, no, I'm full.
She puts down the spoon.
CHUCK
That was great, Mom, just great.
He looks around the house, everything in its place.
His
mother has been here for forty years.
There's a big crack
running down from the ceiling.
CHUCK
I've got all this back pay coming.
Why
don't you let me get you a place in town?
MOM
This is my home.
I'm part of the
wallpaper.
She studies him for a moment.
MOM
You miss it, don't you?
You miss that
island.
He does, but that's not it entirely.
CHUCK
Miss that island?
Mom, come on.
She looks at him.
She knows her boy.
MOM
What a journey you've had.
It seems more
than a person should have to bear.
CHUCK
The tide saved me, Mom.
I lived by it.
I'm just wondering where it will take me
next.
She looks at him, thinks about this.
MOM
Remember the family motto.
In time.
It
will come to you, in time.
HOUSE - DAY
Ladders.
Scaffolds.
Huge paintings are everywhere.
Paintings of wings and angels -- like the package.
Chuck
stares at them.
Bettina watches Chuck stare.
BETTINA
I've got some coffee on.
Would you like
some?
KITCHEN - LATER
Bettina pours some coffee.
The package sits in the counter.
Some magazines are spread around, including a People Magazine
with Chuck's photograph on the cover.
CHUCK
(takes a sip)
It's good.
They smile awkwardly at each other.
She starts to open it.
BETTINA
Hmmm.
Feels like it might have gotten
wet.
CHUCK
Possible.
So you did those wings?
BETTINA
Yeah.
A long time ago.
CHUCK
They're harder to do than they look.
BETTINA
Oh?
You've tried?
CHUCK
Well, I do a little drawing --
She's opened the package.
She pulls out the bottles of salsa
and the letter.
CHUCK
Our apologies that it never made it to
the recipient.
BETTINA
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry
I ever married him.
There is a moment where neither knows what to say.
BETTINA
You look familiar.
Her eyes start to register recognition.
She glances at the
magazine with Chuck's picture on it.
She picks it up.
BETTINA
I can't believe this.
I -- I -- They
are... You're a gifted artist.
You're
into something very powerful.
Primal.
Truly.
CHUCK
Well, not really, I --
BETTINA
You are.
Yes you are.
(so many things she wants to
say)
What gave you the idea to paint on that
cave?
Chuck thinks about that.
After a moment, he grins.
CHUCK
To tell you the truth -- you did.
BETTINA
Do you...have any more packages to
deliver?
CHUCK
No.
that was the last one.
BETTINA
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Chuck sits back on the couch, taking in the sight of the
ocean in the light rain.
He looks over at all the canvases,
the easel, the palettes.
The wind rustles the palm trees
around the house.
The surf crashes and rustles.
Familiar
sounds.
Island sounds.
He relaxes a little.
Maybe the package with the wings was a
sign, he kept it all these years precisely for this.
Then
there's a sound of a truck in the driveway.
The engine cuts off.
There are steps on the porch.
The door
opens.
A tanned muscular MAN in neatly kept work clothes
comes in, hangs a tool belt on a hook by the door.
He looks at Chuck with a relaxed, even stare, as if seeing a
man in a FedEx uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual
occurrence.
MAN
Hey.
CHUCK
Hey.
BETTINA (O.S.)
In here!
The Man nods at Chuck, goes into the kitchen.
We are on
Chuck's face.
Who's this?
We hear muffled laughter from
inside.
FEDEX TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
The FedEx truck makes its way down the beach, Chuck in his
uniform, the Driver in hers.
Two FedEx people in a truck.
The Driver looks over at Chuck.
DRIVER
You're Chuck Noland.
CHUCK
Yeah.
DRIVER/ERICA
I knew it!
You're a legend!
Mr.
Robinson Crusoe.
CHUCK
Well --
ERICA
I knew I recognized you.
My name's
Erica.
They smile at each other.
Then she smiles a little more.
ERICA
Did you really steal a crippled kid's
bicycle to make your deliveries, or is
that just some bullshit story?
CHUCK
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't
crippled.
Erica laughs.
ERICA
Otherwise it's completely true.
And that makes Chuck laugh, really laugh, for the first time.
CHUCK
Yeah, completely.
She looks over at him with a grin.
ERICA
What brings you out to the sticks?
CHUCK
Had a package to deliver.
ERICA
You?
Personally?
CHUCK
I had it on the island with me.
ERICA
Must be a story there.
There's a connection building here, effortlessly.
