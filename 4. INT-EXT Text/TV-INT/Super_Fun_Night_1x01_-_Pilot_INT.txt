                Hi Michael, it s Kimmie. So I haven t 
                really heard from you in a while - 
                like a year!!..sooo I just wanted to 
                say,  Hi!..Whatz up!  I just got some 
                big news:
                      (makes trumpet sound)
                I got promoted at the firm!! Working 
                18 hours a day and taking no vacations 
                really does pay off!!

                Speaking of vacations, I saw on 
                Facebook that you were in the Greek 
                  Islands!!! I wasn t stalking you or 
                anything -- I was just looking at some 
                of your photos... for two hours... and 
                printed some out. Who was that girl in 
                the lime bikini? She looked really 
                FUN!

      Kimmie eyes the webcam, clearly angered.

                There was one picture of you kneeling 
                down, giving her a ring?  Do not know 
                what that s about...

      She knows exactly what this is about.      SUPER FUN NIGHT     Shooting Script 1/22/13       2.

                and Marika. Every Friday we still do 
                our Friday Night Fun Nights. Recently

        demonstrates a tricep press with hers.

                Is that a limited edition Murna

                In England we call a stapler a  Paper

                No. Well, I started calling it that 
                but it never caught on.

                                  FELICITY
                Alright Miss Boubier, are you ready 
                for some fun?

      Felicity asserts the files on Kimmie s desk.

                                  KIMMIE
                Yes!
                      (standing)
                  OWWWWWWWWWW! 

                                  FELICITY
                Oh, come on -- it s only forty-eight 
                  depositions.

                                  KIMMIE
                Oww my God, you re Felicity 
                  Vanderstone!

                                  FELICITY
                Yes, I am.
                      (flicks her hair)
                Are you alright?

                                  KIMMIE
                Um, well, GRAPHIC ALERT!  I may have 
                  accidentally given myself an exotic 
                  piercing.

                                  FELICITY
                Okay?
                      (backing out)
                Well, I know that s a lot, but I ll 
                need those summarized by Friday --

      Kimmie hops over to her.

                                  KIMMIE
                No, wait! I do realize I m making a

                                  KIMMIE (CONT'D)
                not very good at first impressions. 
                The only impression I m really good at 
                is Mickey Mouse:  Hello, I m Mickey 
                Mouse. 

                                  FELICITY
                That s not very good. You should stop 
                that.

      Felicity exits.

                                  KIMMIE
                Okay, anything you say! You re kind of 
                my HERO!

      Kimmie enters Felicity s corner office with her files.

                                  KIMMIE
                  Felicity, hi - all done.

                                  FELICITY
                So fast. Impressive. But I did hear 
                from H.R. that you re a workhorse.

      Kimmie makes a horse noise.

                                  FELICITY (CONT D)
                They said you were top of your class

                  Noooo...yeah.

                                  FELICITY
                You must be very, very smart for the 
                partners to put you up here. Good for 
                you!

                                  KIMMIE
                Um, Felicity, can I ask you something?

                                  FELICITY
                Yes, it s true, I have been asked out 
                on a date by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. 
                Does everyone in the office know 
                already? Oh, how embarrassing.
                      (secretly loving it)

                                  KIMMIE
                Oh, no -- Are you going to Richard 
                Lovell s Welcoming Drinks on Friday?

                                  FELICITY
                Richard is the son of Rupert Lovell, 
                senior partner, so yes. I hate to use 
                the  N  word but, you know...

      Kimmie winces.

                                  KIMMIE
                Okay, so I should definitely go to the 
                drinks then.

                                  FELICITY
                Wait -- Sorry, you were invited? 
                Richard invited you??

                                  KIMMIE
                Yes.
                      (quietly)
                I think he s into chunk.

                        (recovering)
                Oh, great! Well, you should definitely 
                go then. Wear something that will show

      The girls are standing as a threesome, in an awkward pose, 
      ready to take their prom picture. The high school 
      photographer, a girl in a wheelchair called BECKY, is trying 
      to take their photo but is laughing too hard.

                                  BECKY
                      (giggling)
                Oh my God, I can t stop -- sorry -- 
                I m trying to, okay wait, wait I m 
                fine --

                Nope, sorry -- you guys just should 
                never leave the house!!

      Becky laughs so hard she falls out of the chair. The girls 
      are torn as to whether to help her or not.

                                                                        CUT BACK TO:


      Kimmie is talking with Richard.

                                  KIMMIE
                Okay, guess who this is -  Hello, I m -

                I also do impressions. Guess who this 
                is.

      Richard does a brilliant Tom Cruise impression.

                I don t know who that is, but it 
                sounds just like him.

      They laugh. Richard does the Tom Cruise laugh. 

                                  KIMMIE (CONT D)
                Oh, Tom Cruise!!

      Felicity eyes the pair from across the room. Something s 
      annoying her here.

                                                                        CUT BACK TO:


      The girls are now inside the darkened, extremely loud store. 
      House music blares.

                      (yelling)
                I don t like this, it s too dark in 
                here -- and why is it so LOUD? To 
                drown out the sound of rape whistles?

                      (sniffing)
                What is that smell?

      A very young female model, CLAMANTHA, holding a  spritzer,  
      approaches.

                this.

      Kimmie sees a special dress with a zipper from tits to 
      crotch.

                                  KIMMIE
                      (to Clamantha)
                Oh sorry, what sizes does this come 
                in?

                                  CLAMANTHA
                That one comes in  Small,   Extra

      Clamantha exits.

                Kimmie, it s not too late to uncancel 
                the cats.

      Marika holds up a pair of panties with an electric love heart 
      flashing on them.

                I can t wear anything electric. Not 
                with my sweat issues.

                                  KIMMIE
                  Helen-Alice! Marika! Don t worry -- 
                nothing bad is going to happen to us. 
                This is probably going to be the best,

      The girls enter a large darkened space. There s music 
      playing. It appears to be the club:

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                Ah Kimmie, I don t think this is Club 
                Oz.

      They hear the moans of TWO PORN ACTRESSES on a screen. The 
      girls are in fact in an adult movie theatre.

                                  MARIKA
                No, this is something else --
                      (watching)
                Whoa, those chicks are hungry --

                Hey, Helen-Alice.

      Helen-Alice notices the familiar voice and sees that it 
      belongs to her creepy co-worker.

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                Okay, we have to go.

                Well, we don t HAVE to.

      NIGHT (N4)

      The girls enter their apartment and collapse on the couch.

                                  KIMMIE
                So next Friday let s just go back to 
                our regular routine. Wheelchair Becky 
                was right. We have indoor faces-slash- 
                bodies. Tonight was a complete 
                  disaster.

                                  MARIKA
                Well... okay, on some points we double- 
                faulted, but tonight was kind of the 
                most exciting night I ve ever had.

                                  KIMMIE
                Really?

                                  MARIKA
                Yeah! I got eye-banged by like ten 
                  different dudes.

                                                                              CUT TO:


                                    HELEN-ALICE
                And I got my photo taken with two of 
                them. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


                                    HELEN-ALICE
                I m going to get a nice miniature 
                frame to put that in. 

                                  MARIKA
                But Lil Kim, you scored the most -- 
                you did get your boobs touched. 

                                  KIMMIE
                Did I?

                                                                              CUT TO:

                So I guess then, that SUPER FUN NIGHT 
                was a definite success.

                                  MARIKA
                True dat! Where are we going to go
