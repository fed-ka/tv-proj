A black Porsche speeds down a quiet street near the beach,
pulls into a parking space.
Crawford gets out, goes to a pay phone. He puts his cell
phone on top of it, drops in some change and dials.
OPERATOR (ON PHONE)
L.A.P.D.
CRAWFORD
Lieutenant Nunally, please.
He listens to hold music and checks the time.
OPERATOR (ON PHONE)
He doesn't come on til six. You want
his voice mail?
CRAWFORD
No.
Thank you.
(beat)
I'll see him later.
He hangs up, grabs his cell, and takes off down the sidewalk.
Jennifer swims laps with strong, even strokes.
Rob is
enjoying the sun in a lounge chair.
Crawford eyes them as he passes on the other side of a low
fence. Unnoticed, he heads upstairs.
5
Jennifer drives her Mercedes convertible past expensive
houses in the late-afternoon light.
She goes up the driveway of the Crawfords' stark mordern home.
Across the street, MR. GIFFORD is playing catch with his
GRANDSON. He waves to Jennifer.
She waves back, friendly but distracted, on her way to the
front door.
Gifford and his Grandson turn to look at the Crawford house.
Gifford leans on the frosted-glass panel next to the door -
hands cupped around his eyes, trying to see in.
GIFFORD
Tom?
Jen?
Everything okay in there?
Helicopters overhead, SWAT teams setting up. Nearby houses
have been emptied, gawking NEIGHBORS and media vans moved
back to a block away.
UNIFORM COPS pull aside the barriers as a plain-wrap sedan
rolls through. It pulls up by the SWAT Command Truck.
ROB NUNALLY gets out, surveying the scene. The guy who spent
his afternoon with Jennifer Crawford in the hotel is an
L.A.P.D. Detective.
SWAT COMMANDER
You the Negotiator?
NUNALLY
Yeah.
What do we know?
Nunally is standing by the open trunk of his sedan, wearing a
Kevlar vest now - putting on his shoulder-holster over it.
Into his cell-phone:
NUNALLY
Mr. Crawford?
CRAWFORD
Who is this?
NUNALLY
My name is Lieutenant Robert Nunally.
I'm a hostage negotiator for the Los -
Crawford hangs up.
Thoughtful.
10
NUNALLY
Mr. Crawford?
Nunally grimaces, shuts his phone, shaking his head. But
then he turns - with the SWAT Commander and everyone else -
- as Crawford's front door unlocks and opens a few inches.
Nunally considers this, looks at the SWAT COMMANDER.
NUNALLY
Okay then.
Here we go.
He pulls his suit jacket back on, then reaches into the trunk
for his back-up gun. He tucks it into the back of his belt,
concealed under the jacket.
He takes a walkie-talkie and starts for the house.
The spectators fall silent.
Radios crackle and hiss as he
heads up the driveway.
Jennifer's stretcher is loaded into an ambulance, doors
slamming shut and sirens kicking on -
- as Crawford, cuffed behind his back, is pushed into the
back seat of a police car. His eyes on the ambulance as it
pulls away, carrying his wife.
The alarm clock shifts to 6:00 am and pops on to local news
and traffic -
- but the narrow futon bed is already empty.
WILLY SLOCUM works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, lit
by a solitary lamp.
He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-pale
but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern
Oklahoma State College.
He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. As he
goes to the closet-sized bathroom, pulling off his sweatshirt
and starting the tiny pre-fab shower, we linger on the laptop
screen: rental listings for a new apartment.
TIME CUT
The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor
and painted-plywood walls. His clothes hang neatly on a
length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters.
Law school texts fill cinderblock-and-board shelves.
The radio chatters.
Willy knots a tie in his crisp white
collar.
TIME CUT
Willy methodically packs legal folders from last night's
"homework" into his big, battered briefcase. He has to work
to stuff all the files in.
He pulls on his suit jacket, settles the shoulders, tugs at
his cuffs. Uncaps a pen, leans over a one-sentence letter
waiting on the desk. Reads it over.
As he signs, we glimpse:
- hereby give notice that I will be resigning my
position at the District Attorney's Office as of
Novemb-
16
Willy savors the moment.
Then he tucks the letter into an envelope, gets the heavy
briefcase - goes to shut off the light and open the door -
- which swings about six inches, then clonks into something.
Willy grimaces.
Peeks out, goes to pound on a wall.
WILLY
Mrs. Demello?
(Beat)
MRS. DEMELLO!
Your CAR!
Silence. He sighs.
Shuts the door and presses a button near
the light-switch.
There's mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly
rolls up, letting in daylight and revealing an alley beyond
the hanging clothes and cinderblock shelves.
He presses the garage-door-opener button again, and hurries
across the apartment to duck out under the closing door.
Willy straightens and takes a breath, re-settling his suit
jacket with an irritable glance at his landlady's car, parked
sloppily next to the garage, blocking his door.
As he walks away, down the alley, we rise up to reveal the
hazy sprawling landscape of L.A. - and the towers of
Downtown, rising ahead of Willy like Oz.
WILLY (V.O.)
Come on, Phil: I called you as a
courtesy, and you start looking to
take advantage?
They stroll the emptying plaza, dressed to the nines.
NIKKI
Bob assigned you to my team. I'll
supervise your case-work, steer you
through the office arcana, and
generally keep an eye on you.
WILLY
Kind of like a mentor.
NIKKI
Kind of like a probation officer.
Beat. Willy nods, meeting Nikki's gaze as she looks to make
sure he's got it.
WILLY
Okay.
NIKKI
Wooton Sims expects absolute loyalty
and a hundred-and-ten-percent
performance. But: you get to work on
legendary litigation. National,
sometimes global, in scope. It's high-
stakes. And cut-throat - even within
the team. We burn out associates at
an astonishing rate.
WILLY
You're trying to scare me.
NIKKI
Yes.
WILLY
You're going to have to try harder.
She stops walking.
Studying Willy.
31
NIKKI
Can I ask you something personal?
WILLY
Sure.
NIKKI
Who are you?
Willy doesn't answer. Maybe uncertain what she means. Maybe
not wanting her to know. Or even not knowing, himself.
NIKKI
We have a guy in our criminal
division, fresh out of Yale, named
Calvin Tyler. One of our very rich
clients gets pulled over, D.U.I. -
which is routine bullshit, so Calvin
gets it. Against you. Next thing we
know, Calvin is fired, and Bob Wooton,
who has never even interviewed a
junior associate before - let alone
hired one - says you're on my team.
Willy weighs his options.
Decides to level:
WILLY
It was a good bust, so Calvin came to
me for a deal. I told him if he could
arrange an interview for me with Mr.
Wooton, I would throw the case. I
laid out his arguments and evidence
for him - and I showed him how I would
lose. Calvin set up my appointment
for the day after our court date.
Then he did what I had suggested in
court - and I wiped the floor with
him. Your client got the maximum.
Next day, I met with Mr. Wooton.
(Shrugs)
Bob.
Beat.
NIKKI
Wow. You know what's brilliant about
that?
WILLY
Yes.
32
NIKKI
You didn't actually do anything all
that wrong.
WILLY
Well - I wasn't entirely honest with
Calvin.
His cell-phone rings.
He ignores it.
NIKKI
You gonna get that?
WILLY
Everyone I need to talk to is here.
They are both feeling the electricity in the air between them.
They wait the phone out, enjoying the forbidden insanity of
it. But then:
NIKKI
We need to talk about your transition
timetable.
WILLY
All right.
NIKKI
Bob believes in trial-by-fire. He
wants you up-to-speed two weeks from
Tuesday, because we're getting on a
plane to Chicago for depositions in a
class-action against our biggest
client, Armstead Pharmaceutical.
WILLY
No problem.
She studies Willy, trying to make sure he understands:
NIKKI
That's catch-up on three years' work -
and you haven't closed out your old
job yet.
WILLY
I'm good at trials.
Even by fire.
Beat.
NIKKI
You know, a little bit of fear can be
a very healthy thing to have.
33
WILLY
I'm looking forward to when I can
afford the luxury of having some.
Nikki sighs, smiles.
Enjoying him, somewhat reluctantly.
NIKKI
I'll have them put the Armstead
materials in your new office.
WILLY
Thanks.
Boss.
He watches her head off into the night. He remains, alone,
in his tuxedo, looking at the elegant glittering arts plaza.
Then he checks his cell-phone.
Dials.
INTERCUT WITH:
JUDGE ROBINSON presiding. A mid-sized crowd, including a few
REPORTERS. A UNIFORM COP is in the witness box, Willy stands
in the Prosecution Table.
UNIFORM COP
We established a perimeter around the
house and then waited for SWAT and the
Negotiator. It was strictly by the
book.
WILLY
So the house was completely surrounded
within how long of the first shots?
Crawford sits alone at the Defense Table. He wears an
expensive suit and no handcuffs, but two DEPUTIES sit behind
him. He's barely listening to the testimony - drawing on his
legal pad: intricate, dense complex diagrams of "Rube
Goldberg" contraptions.
UNIFORM COP
Maybe ten minutes.
WILLY
And when you arrived at the sc-
Crawford noisily tears a page off his pad.
Looks up - sees
Willy, and everyone else, turned to him.
CRAWFORD
Sorry.
45
Willy sighs, returns to the Cop.
WILLY
When you arrived on the scene, was
there a crowd?
UNIFORM COP
Oh yeah. Neighbors, came out to look
soon as it started.
WILLY
And from what you could ascertain, no
one went into or came out of the house
until SWAT and the negotiator arrived?
UNIFORM COP
Definitely not.
WILLY
Thank you.
No further questions.
JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Crawford?
Crawford looks up from his drawing.
CRAWFORD
What?
JUDGE ROBINSON
Your witness, Mr. Crawford.
Crawford takes in the Uniform Cop.
CRAWFORD
No questions for this witness.
Willy watches Crawford return diligently to his doodles.
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE-UP: THE DEFENSE TABLE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
It's a mess of loose legal-pad pages torn from Crawford's
pad, each covered in madly intricate schematics. He works on
yet another, head down, intent.
Dr. MARION KANG is on the stand, using a marker on a big
diagram of a head:
46
DR. KANG
- through the frontal cortex and the
temporal lobe, coming to rest against
the back of the skull.
WILLY
So this bullet inflicted serious
injury?
DR. KANG
It inflicted serious and irreparable
injury.
Willy nods, allowing the jury time on this. He checks a note-
card, glances at Crawford. Considers his options.
WILLY
Dr. Kang, is it safe to say that
someone inflicting this kind of wound
intended to kill?
Judge Robinson gives Willy a warning look.
JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Crawford, you might want to
object. The witness can't know your
state of mind.
Crawford doesn't even look up from his drawing.
CRAWFORD
No thank you, your honor.
Willy gives Judge Robinson an I-told-you-so shrug.
Turns to
Dr. Kang.
KANG
I would say so, yes.
WILLY
Thank you, Dr. Kang.
Crawford tears off the page, starts another.
A massive search is under way.
Marchand's S.I.D. Team has been doubled, back-up by a dozen
SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES -
- passing hand-held metal detectors along the furniture -
- taking pictures down from the walls -
- turning over mattresses - patting-down every item hanging
in the closets -
- wriggling into crawlspaces - poking into light fixtures
recessed into the ceilings -
- opening the air-conditioning unit, up on the roof -
- ripping out Crawford's high-end home-theater system -
- taking apart the Porsche in the garage.
Willy paces the edges of the action, restless, edgy.
Hours have passed.
60
Willy steps out of the front door, because he's going stir-
crazy inside. Stands watching two TECHS walk the lawn and
flower-beds with metal detectors.
He notices, past the S.I.D. vans and Sheriff's Dept. black-
and-whites parked in the driveway:
Nunally, in his parked car, across the street.
He meets Willy's eyes.
Worried.
Willy can't give him any news. So he pretends he didn't see
the question in Nunally's eyes, looks away. Takes a breath,
turns and goes back in to work.
Willy wanders.
Tina, the assistant, waits in the doorway.
He's trying to conceal the fact that he's on a fishing
expedition.
WILLY
So this is all exactly how he left it.
TINA
Yes.
Browses a wall of framed photos: Crawford at crash sites,
universities, engineering test-labs - awards, certificates,
articles from industry publications lauding Crawford as the
Go-To-Guy for investigating mechanical failures of aircraft.
WILLY
And he was - distraught.
TINA
He was drinking. The past few weeks.
WILLY
But he was working on this.
He stands over unfinished Rube Goldberg device.
Tools laid
out on the work table - meticulous, organized.
WILLY
All distraught and everything.
It's not evidence.
TINA
Do you want coffee.
He said I should
ask.
Willy turns, a little rattled.
Beat.
67
WILLY
Tell him I said no thank you.
WILLY
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you -
NIKKI
Did you hear me, when I said Bob
wanted you gone as soon as this thing
broke?! Did you hear me say I went
out on a limb to convince him -
WILLY
Wouldn't it be better than damage
control if I actually turn it around?
NIKKI
And what if you don't?
Willy has no answer. He doesn't think that way. And she
sees that. She sees a young man from Oklahoma, in way over
his head. Desperate to get through:
NIKKI
You don't get it at all, do you?! You
pulled a stunt to get yourself this
job. Fine: you're a hot-shot!
(Beat)
Wooton Sims does not need hot-shots.
Because you don't win. The firm wins.
Bob wins.
(MORE)
73
NIKKI (cont'd)
(Beat)
And you just put yourself head-to-head
in conflict with Bob.
Silence.
Shaken:
WILLY
What am I supposed to do?
NIKKI
We told the man you're getting on a
plane to Chicago, Tuesday.
Painful silence.
WILLY
Yeah.
Okay.
Nikki watches him dealing with it, sympathetic. The
impossible feelings always running under the surface for them
have developed a darker, aching tone. If anything, stronger.
WILLY
I think maybe I'm gonna go now.
NIKKI
All right.
(Beat)
Call if you want.
He nods. Neither one moves. Judge Gardner enters cautiously
from the dining room - breaking the spell.
Nikki nods goodbye to Willy, and goes out quickly without
meeting her father's eye. Awkward pause.
WILLY
I've got some work to do.
I need to call a cab.
Gardner nods respectfully, but doesn't move quite yet.
Studying the torn-up young man.
GARDNER
You know what nobody understands about
certain kinds of underpaid public
service work? Now and then you get to
put a fucking stake in a bad guy's
heart. We're not supposed to talk
about that when we visit a third-grade
class on Career Day, and it doesn't
get you very far into the country-club
locker room - but it's hard to beat
when you actually get to do it.
74
Willy looks at the kindly old judge, a little surprised.
Gardner shrugs: my two cents.
He goes to a side-table, finds
the Yellow Pages.
Willy - in a clean suit and crisp suit, carrying his
briefcase - hurries through, paying no attention to the
SECRETARIES and OTHER D.D.A.s who watch like he's on his way
to his own execution.
At his office door, he gestures for Mona to come in with him.
Surprised, she gets up - taking with her an envelope with a
messenger-receipt taped to the front.
Crawford comes in through the lobby: rested, well-dressed.
A
free man. He slows, surprised -
- seeing Willy come off the elevators. Willy hasn't left
Jennifer's bedside. He's in the same suit and carrying his
briefcase from the courthouse.
CRAWFORD
Mr. Slocum.
WILLY
Just...visiting.
CRAWFORD
This isn't like you at all.
WILLY
No?
90
CRAWFORD
You haven't got anything to gain.
WILLY
Oh - right. That's my weak spot.
(Beat)
Ever think about what yours might be?
Your flaw?
CRAWFORD
Of course I have.
(Leans in)
The truth about me is, Willy...I'm
really not very nice.
Willy nods.
Concealing the ace up his sleeve.
WILLY
You sure do know a lot, though. Got
everybody all figured out, everything
set up, like one of your contraptions.
Then you just sit back and watch it
all fall right where you want it to.
Must be kind of...boring. At that
point.
CRAWFORD
Not an ounce of sympathy, Willy?
(Beat)
Imagine it - imagine she was yours.
And you knew you were losing her.
(beat)
Imagine days. Weeks. Going through
her desk. Her purse. Her closet.
Alone. Staring at her clothes. Her
shoes. Knowing this is what it will
be like. After.
(beat)
Do you have any idea how hard it was
to go on living - with her - every
day, knowing?
WILLY
But you had to, right? You needed
time to set it all up...your "crime of
passion."
CRAWFORD
There are many kinds of passion,
Willy.
91
WILLY
Yeah.
There are.
(Beat)
So - thank you.
Crawford frowns.
Starting to feel wary.
Willy sees it.
Enjoys it.
WILLY
For sharing your wisdom. All your
little helpful bits of information.
(Beat)
You were right.
CRAWFORD
About...?
WILLY
Talking to her.
Beat.
Willy winks.
He goes past Crawford and out the doors.
Crawford doesn't move - except to turn and watch Willy.
Uncertain, for the first time since we've met him.
Willy's walking alongside Judge Robinson, as they leave the
building. The Judge is wearing his "civilian clothes."
JUDGE ROBINSON
What do the doctors say?
WILLY
People wake up out of these things.
JUDGE ROBINSON
What did the doctors say, Mr. Slocum?
WILLY
They said...there's no way to really
know. I'm trying to get them to run
more tests - but I was there, and I'm
telling you.
96
JUDGE ROBINSON
I'm sorry. I have no probable cause
to issue a court order against Mr.
Crawford - and he's protected agai-
WILLY
WHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE?!
WHAT'S
PROTECTING HER?!
The Judge stops - giving Willy a hard eye: I'm sympathetic,
but yelling at me is not a smart approach.
Willy looks at the Judge a second - hapless, frustrated,
scared - then nods and shakes his head and turns away -
hurrying off through the homeward-bound crowds.
The Judge watches him go.
Grimaces.
We move with Willy out to the quiet street. The windows of
the houses he passes seem warm and safe - and very far away.
Behind him, Lobruto watches from his lighted doorway.
Willy walks, shaken, determined, into the night.
A NURSE checks Jennifer Crawford's vital signs. She then
begins to gently wash Jennifer's face, where it's not taped
or bandaged.
The monitor beeps, the ventilator hisses.
Judge Gardner pulls his car out to the street -
- swerving hastily, as Willy's car skids alongside and forces
him to the curb, horn honking.
Willy pulls to a stop, blocking Gardner's way, and gets out
of the car - holding up both palms: just wait.
Willy pulls into a NO PARKING zone and jumps out, papers in
hand - tossing the keys to an ORDERLY smoking a cigarette -
WILLY
Move it if you need to!
- running through the automatic doors.
100
A Sikorsky S-76 Medevac chopper is preparing to take off,
very loud and windy.
Through the open doorway and the thick windows, we can
glimpse Crawford sitting beside Jennifer, who is strapped on
to a gurney. She's connected to life-support equipment.
The MED TECH is outside, checking a few last supplies and
giving Crawford a moment alone with his wife.
Crawford moves. He may be whispering to her.
Or adjusting
her pillow. Hard to tell.
As he climbs out of the chopper -
- he sees Willy across the roof, arguing with Dr. Lunt, who
is skimming the court documents, shaking his head.
Crawford, curious, walks toward the two men.
Dr. Lunt hands Crawford the court order. As Crawford reads
them, Lunt and Willy shout over the helicopter engine:
DR. LUNT
This orders him not to take her off
life support! He's not! We can't
stop the man from -
WILLY
Then just hold it - for a couple of
hours! Have it inspected!
102
DR. LUNT
You're talking about a phenomenally
expensive delay, Mr. Slocum - when the
man has every right to move his wife!
WILLY
She's not gonna get there!
He looks at Crawford: reading - amused, thoughtful.
WILLY
This man is a mechanical engineer with
expertise in air crashes! He has
access to airfields and he knows
exactly how to make it look like an
accident! You know what he did! You
know why she's like this!
Lunt hesitates, feeling a tiny edge of doubt.
Crawford checks his watch.
Looks into Willy's eyes -
- then gestures for Willy to join him, and turns back to walk
across the pad to the helicopter. Climbs in.
Willy stares, stunned.
Lunt looks at him: case closed. The rotors whirl faster,
engine noise rising to a scream.
From the open chopper doorway, Crawford looks at Willy again
and gestures for him to get on.
Willy doesn't know how to react.
Slowly, he starts to walk
toward the helicopter.
Looking directly down at the Sikorsky as it glides over a
picturesque mapscape of streets and freeways, gray and terra-
cotta rooftops, blue kidneys and rectangles of pool.
The Sikorsky glides over cross-hatched parking lots, a pale
swath of beach -
- and the white foaming edge of the Pacific.
Deep dark vast blue.
The Sikorsky flies over.
Small.
Lobruto is walking toward his car when Willy steps out of the
garage and calls after him:
WILLY
His wife is dead!
Lobruto turns.
Uncertain what Willy is getting at.
WILLY
We can still get him.
We can take him
back to court.
LOBRUTO
(Gently)
Willy...
Willy comes toward him - excited, insistent:
WILLY
Double jeopardy doesn't apply! We
bring a new charge - of homicide.
LOBRUTO
Willy - what happened to you, on the
helicopter - we don't even know if we
could prove -
110
WILLY
No: he shot her and she died. The
fact that it took time - the fact that
he went to trial in between, just for
shooting her - doesn't matter. He
fired a gun and caused her death, and
that's murder.
(Beat)
If he can twist the law around - then
so can we.
Lobruto thinks it out.
Wary.
LOBRUTO
A second indictment on the same
incident?
WILLY
A man burns down a house; we charge
him with arson. There were people
sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in
the hospital, they die. We'd charge
him with murder. Right?
Lobruto nods. On the fence, but seeing it now.
Impressed
with the young man's fervor, and his logic.
But he shakes his head.
LOBRUTO
All your evidence is still toxic.
The
confession, the arrest - it's all
still inadmissible.
Willy grimaces.
Looks down.
Thinking, intense.
LOBRUTO
I'm sorry, Willy. It was a good idea,
but -
WILLY
I'll get something new.
LOBRUTO
How?
Willy looks up at him.
Calm now.
WILLY
You don't want to know.
LOBRUTO
Willy, you can't -
111
WILLY
I don't work for you.
(Beat)
Right?
Beat. Lobruto sighs, as Willy nods and turns to start back
to the garage. With work to do.
LOBRUTO
Don't do anything crazy.
WILLY
What else have we got left?
Willy disappears inside.
