        live, and it s not a bad place to be.  We land on a 
        humble turn of the century house on a middle-class

        JULIA BRAVERMAN (32) is beautiful, successful smart, even 
      in her sweats and a ponytail she could still do a 
        magazine shoot.  She has meticulously packed the back of 
        their SUV-hybrid with picnic lunch, frisbee, picnic 
        blankets, etc.  Her angelic looking daughter SYDNEY (5)  
        comes out, still sleepy eyed, and Julia kisses her all 
      over her body.

                      You re up.  Yum, yum, yum, yum, I think 
                      I m going to eat you for lunch.

      JOEL (early 30s), Sydney's startling good looking stay-at-
        home-dad husband walks out--

                                        JOEL
                              (re: the packed car)
                      What s this?

                                        JULIA
                      I know I ve been working so much this 
                      week, but this weekend, it s just the 
                      three of us.  I m talking frisbee.  I m 
                      talking kids concert in the park.  I m 
                      talking crazy ass bonding. 
                              (off their stares)
                      What?

                                        JOEL
                      It s Joey P s birthday party at Chuck E 
                      Cheese this morning.  Her entire class is 
                      going.

                                        JULIA
                      That s today?  Oh no.  Do we really want 
                      to eat pizza at ten in the morning?  I 
                      made frittatas.

                      Unlimited.  Like a google.  More than a 
                      google.  Like infinity tokens.

        Julia looks at the picnic lunch she just worked for hours 
        preparing.  Then at Sydney s pleading eyes, Julia does 
      what is harder for her than most people, switch gears.  
        She reaches for a large bottle of Purell and puts on a 
        brave smile--

                                        JULIA
                      Okay.  It s Chucky E Cheese!

        The  Mackabee Hardware Cubs  take the field and Adam 
        excitedly yells out encouraging words from his head coach 
        position in the dugout.

                                        ADAM
                      Jordan take a few steps over toward 
                      second.  Gabriel, five steps in.

        Max is playing second base.  His feet are crossed.        "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   5.



                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Max, let s uncross those feet. 

        The pitch.  Ground ball to second base!  Adam screams 
      out.

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Max.  Get in front of it.  Gobble it up.  

        The ball goes right through Max s legs into right field.  
        A COMMUNAL groan from the field and even some of the 
        parents.  Adam winces, exchanges a pained looked with 
        Kristina, then recovers.

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      That s okay.  That s okay, pal.  You ll 
                      get the next one.

      Adam takes out his cell, hits speed dial.  A GROGGY VOICE 
        picks up.

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Where the hell are you?  The game 
                      started.  You re my assistant coach.  I 
                      need you here, jackass.

                                                                      INTERCUT WITH:



        Sarah drags Amber out by the arm.  Drew walks along like 
      this is an everyday occurrence.        "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   7.



                                        AMBER
                      You re ruining my life.  Why are you 
                      doing this to me? 

                                        SARAH
                      I m doing this so you two could be in 
                      decent schools and be around your family 
                      and maybe grow up to be decent upstanding 
                      citizens of the world. 

                                        DREW
                      I hardly even know my cousins.

                                        SARAH
                      Of course you know them.  Don t be 
                      ridiculous.  I am telling you this is 
                      going to be great.  I feel things turning 
                      around for us.  Who s turn is it to push?

                                        DREW
                      Hers.

      Drew gets into the driver s seat as Amber and Sarah get 
      in the back of the car and start pushing.

                                        AMBER
                      You couldn t park going downhill?

      IN A WIDE SHOT: Amber and Sarah PUSH the car.

                                        SARAH
                              (to Drew)
                      Drop it into second, sweetie!

                                                                              CUT TO:



        QUICK CUTS:

        --Boom! MAX strikes out.

        --Bam! MAX drops a fly ball in right field.

        --Wham! The other team hits a ground ball home run and 
        celebrate at home plate.

        RESUME...

        OUR TEAM S having a late inning rally.  Crosby has now 
        arrived, and stands next to Joel, holding the score nook.  
        A batter walks, loading the bases.  

                                        ADAM
                      Okay, we re only down by seven!  We can 
                      do this.

        But the energy in the dugout dies as Max steps out of the 
        dugout holding a bat in his hands. 

                                        TEAMMATE
                      Oh, no, Max is up.  We might as well go 
                      home.

                                        ADAM
                      Hey!  Not cool.

      Adam walks up to Max, who heard this, and kneels next to 
      him.        "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   10.



                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Okay, Max, I know I said to swing away, 
                      but remember a walk s as good as a hit.  

        Max looks at Adam, he looks like he s on the verge of 
        tears.

                                        MAX
                      Can t someone else hit?

                                        ADAM
                      What?

                                        MAX
                      Please.  I suck.  I m going to strike 
                      out.  Everyone s going to hate me.

                                        ADAM
                      Listen to me.  Okay?  It doesn t matter 
                      whether you get a hit or not.  The game s 
                      all about having fun.

                                        MAX
                      I m not having any fun.

      Adam doesn t have a comeback for this.

                                        ADAM
                      Just try your best, pal.

        Max reluctantly walks to the plate.  

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Alright, Max.  Let s bring it, baby.  
                      Bend your knees.  Not that much.  Bat 
                      back.  Elbow up.

        The PITCHER winds, delivers.  SWOOSH!  Strike one.

                                        CROSBY
                      That kid can t be eight.  Did you see 
                      that pitch?

                                        ADAM
                      I saw it.

        The Pitcher winds.  WOOSH!  Strike two!

                                        CROSBY
                      What did they do, bring him in from the 
                      Dominican Republic?      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   11.



                                        ADAM
                      Any time you want to shut up would be 
                      great.  Okay, Max, gotta cover the plate 
                      now, buddy.  Swing at anything close.

        The Pitcher delivers.  And Max swings and CONNECTS!  
        Well, barely.  The ball goes about a foot and a half and 
        stops.  In fair territory.  Shocked, Max just stands 
        there.  Then like in a dream ADAM starts screaming: 

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      RUN!  RUN MAX RUN!

        Max finally breaks for first.  Picks up speed.  The big 
        bruiser of a CATCHER runs for the ball.  Picks it up.  
        Throws to first.  The ball and Max get there at almost 
        the exact same moment.  The UMPIRE yells,  OUT!   

        All goes silent.  HOLD ON Adam.  Frozen.  No, it can't 
        be.  He couldn't possibly have made that call.  And then 
        suddenly something comes over Adam, something primal, 
        something he isn't in control of.

      WE MOVE WITH ADAM as he marches ONTO THE FIELD toward the 
        Umpire and COMPLETELY FUCKING LOSES IT.  

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Are you kidding me?  He was safe.  What 
                      the hell is wrong with you?  You can t do 
                      that, you can t take that away from him.  
                      No way.  

                                        UMPIRE
                      Stand back, Coach.

                                        ADAM
                      No, I m not going to stand back.  

        And as Adam s anger begins to build the dialogue drops 
        out giving way to score.  Adam gets up close, arguing 
      nose to nose with the Umpire, like it were the major 
        leagues.  Kristina watches, shocked.  As does Max.  
        Crosby tries to calm Adam down.  Both teams stand in the 
        dugout stare at the crazy man, as do all the parents.  
        Finally, Adam kicks dirt at the Umpire and the Ump, with 
        a grand gesture, throws him out of the game.

      In a wide shot, Adam walks across the field toward the 
        parking lot.  

                                                                            BLACKOUT:

                             ACT ONE



        Sarah s Volvo with a U-Haul trailer pulls to a stop in 
        front of her childhood home -- the least kept up house on 
        the block.  Sarah honks the horn to indicate their 
        arrival and a gaggle of Bravermans cascade out through 
        the front door to greet them.  This is everyone we ve 
        already met (Adam, Kristina, Haddie, Max, Julia, Joel, 
        Sydney, Crosby) and CAMILLE (60s) winning, elegant, 
        sarcastic from years of marriage.  AND last but not least 
      ZEEK (60s) Vietnam vet, turned hippie, turned actor, 
        turned entrepreneur, embraces Sarah, his favorite -- the 
        complicated one, the one who he feels most resembles 
        himself--

                                        ZEEK
                      Sweetheart.  This was a brilliant idea to 
                      move back.

                                        SARAH
                      It was your idea, Dad.

                      We re going to whip those kids into 
                      shape.  Drew, get over here.  Shake my 
                      hand.  No.  Like a man. 

                                        CAMILLE
                      Leave him alone.  You re scaring him.  
                      Come on.  I made the lasagna.



      IN THE BACKYARD

        Basketball game.  Zeek and Max take on Crosby and Adam.

                                        ZEEK
                      Max -- move!  Boards!  Go.  Max, how many 
                      times do I tell you, when I say break, 
                      you break!

                                        ADAM
                      Dad!  Leave him alone.

      Adam looks through the kitchen window exchanging a 
        frustrated look with Kristina, taking us into--

        THE KITCHEN

        Julia, Sarah and Kristina load and rinse--

                      Julia s old boyfriend.  They were one hot

                      you, Sweetie.

        Sarah gets into the car and slams the door shut.  OFF 
        this, we,

                                                                            BLACKOUT:

        A huge sign on the side of the building says 
           CHEESESTEAKS.   There should be little confusion about 
      what to order here.



      Once out the door, Sarah just gets pissed--

                                        SARAH
                              (into phone)

                      What are you talking about?

                                        SARAH
                      I m sorry I m not a big lawyer walking 
                      around on the weekend in Juicy 
                      sweatpants, but does that mean I should 
                      be going out with a short, fat, balding 
                      barista?  Really?  Is that who I am to 
                      you?

                      Don t you dare  Oh God  me.  I know 
                      you re sexier than me, Julia.  Everyone 
                      does.  For God s sake you re married to a 
                      fucking Ken doll.  Did you really have to 
                      do this?

                                        SARAH
                      You always have to prove you re better 
                      than me.  You ve always been setting me 
                      up with the B team--

                                        JULIA
                      Oh God, Sarah, will you just grow up 
                      already?  Everything s not a goddamn 
                      conspiracy.

                                        SARAH
                      I will never let you set me up again.  
                      Ever.

                                        JULIA
                      Good.  Because I m done trying to help 
                      you.

                      No, screw you!  More later.  I have a 
                      fucking date.


        She hangs up and walks back up to--

        HER TABLE --

        She puts on a demur smile.  Sits.

                      Everything okay?

                      Hey, I have to show you something.

        Jim takes out a ring, it has one of those yin-yang 
        symbols on it.

                                        SARAH
                      Oh my God, is this--

                                        JIM
                      It s yours.  It s the ring I gave you.

                                        SARAH
                      How did you wind up with it?

                                        JIM
                      Oh, well, I don t know if you remember, 
                      you sort of threw it at me that night you 
                      broke up with me.

                                        SARAH
                      Oh my God, that s right.  I got you right

                      out--

                      For the Phillies--

      They both laugh.  There s a beat then--

                                        JIM

                      I re-build trucks from the 30s, I have 
                      several ping pong trophies on display in 
                      my otherwise unimpressive apartment and 
                      if that isn t enough, which I m sure it 
                      is, the New Yorker just told me they were 
                      publishing one of my poems.

                                        SARAH
                      What?  Oh my God.  That s... The actual

                      Yeah, thanks...  

        She smiles at him, remembering how charming he is.  He 
        looks at her, growing serious.

                                        JIM (CONT D)
                      I m really glad you called.  I ve always 
                      thought about you, Sarah.

        Sarah is incredibly touched by this.  By the idea of 
        being seen by someone, even someone who hasn t seen her.  
        She starts to tear up.

                                        JIM (CONT D)
                      Are you--

                      Oh, Jesus, I can t believe myself.

                                        JIM
                      What s wrong--

                                        SARAH
                      I m just, I don t know.  You just kept 
                      this ring all these years and you re 
                      funny and nice and I married a complete 
                      asshole with all kinds substance abuse 
                      issues -- I m such a fucking jerk.  Oh 
                      God, I m so sorry, this is morbidly 
                        embarrassing.  You have to understand I m 
                      out of practice with the whole dating 
                      thing.  And even in my prime, I was 
                      really bad at it which I don t have to 
                      tell you...

        She wipes her eyes, blows her nose, finally meets his 
        eyes, feeling vulnerable.  He just looks right back at 
        her smiles.

        Sarah pulls to a stop outside the school and Drew is 
        about to get out.  Sort of a moment of truth.  She s got 
      to say something.

                                        SARAH
                      Drew...?

      He stops for a moment, his hand still on the door handle, 
        indicating he s not up for a big talk.

                      It s okay.  I don t want to--

                                        SARAH
                      I know I m your mom, but I m also a 
                      woman... Oh God, delete, delete, delete.  
                      What I m trying to say is that no matter 
                      what you saw last night, and no matter 
                      what permanent indelible mark it might 
                      have left on your memory, that I m first 
                      and foremost your mother and that you and 
                      Amber are my number one priorities.  
                      Always.  

        There s a long beat, Drew seems thoughtful, then--

                                        DREW
                      I want to move back in with Dad.

        Sarah s expression freezes.  She is completely blind-
        sided. 

                                        SARAH
                      What?

                      your brothers and sisters and your old 
                      boyfriends or whatever, but this isn t 
                      home to me.  I want to be back in 
                      Trenton.  So I figure it makes sense.

      Drew gets out of the car and closes the door.  Sarah sits 
        there, flabbergasted.

                      Hey, I could do a lot worse.  Maybe it s 
                      time I grow up.

                      Crosby, you can t just decide to grow up.  
                      And I would argue that getting engaged to 
                      a woman just because you were jealous of 
                      her donor sperm is not actually the act 
                      of an adult.       "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   53.

                      What are your thoughts?

      Adam just looks at him, incredulous. Then, simply:

                      You re an idiot.

        Julia drives by in her car and cranes her neck looking 
        through the window of this groovy, cafe.  She gets 
        distracted seeing Joel and Racquel at a table.  A honk.  
        A swerve.  A near miss.  Julia pulls over and a car goes 
      by flipping her the bird.  Julia has landed in a good 
      spot from which to spy on.  Feeling like an idiot she 
        takes out a pair of binoculars and looks through them.  

      IN THE RESTAURANT Joel and Racquel, smile at each other.  
        They re fighting over the check.  Their hands touch, 
        their eyes meet.  Julia watches, feeling ill.

        Kristina paces in front of a large office building in the

                      Look, I ve been thinking about this.  We 
                      talk to the school and get Max a tutor.

                      It s not just the academics.  It s not 
                      just the biting.  It s not just the 
                      pirate costume.  Or the fear of fire.  Or 
                      the tantrums.  It s everything.  There s 
                      something going on with him.

      Adam looks at her, every cell in his body unwilling to go 
        along with this.

        OFF the two of them, her eyes filled with tears.  He 
        looks at her, not wanting this to be true.

      Adam pulls to a stop with Max, in his pirate costume.  
        Max walks out of the car, is about to close the door--

                                        ADAM
                      Max.  Your bookbag.

        Max reaches in and gets his bookbag.  Adam gets out and 
        starts walking Max up the block to the school.  Adam 
        looks his son, watching everything in a new way.  Another 
        student passes Max--

                                        OTHER STUDENT
                      Hey Max!

        Max doesn t respond.

                                        ADAM
                      Max.  That kid just said hello to you.  
                      If you don t say hello he ll think you re 
                      being rude.

                                        MAX
                      Okay.

                      Uh-huh.

        Adam s heart is breaking in two.  The bell rings.  Max 
        turns to leave.

                                        ADAM
                      Max? -- Max!

        Max turns.

                      I love you.

        Max smiles, and turns around and walks away.  Adam 
        watches.  Devastated.  The whole thing is sinking in on 
      him.  Hitting him like a ton of bricks.  PAUL, another 
      dad, approaches somberly.

                      Listen this is a little uncomfortable.  
                      The board at the Little League had a 
                      meeting last night.  The consensus was it 
                      might be better if you stepped aside.  
                      Let someone else coach the rest of the 
                      year.  Jordan Shefranick s dad is able to 
                      step in.

      Adam nods.  Not entirely thrilled.  Not surprised either.  
      Then the tough part--

                                        PAUL (CONT D)
                      And Adam, they ve also asked me to tell 
                      you that you can t be present at future 
                      games.  They ve gotten some complaints 
                      from some parents.  Apparently, the 
                      Umpire is threatening a lawsuit.  Really

                                (then, compelled)
                      It was a bad call.

      Paul walks away.  HOLD on Adam.

                      I should have listened to Grandma and

                      I m sorry, Drew.  I m so sorry.  But you 
                      can t go on forever believing that your 
                      dad s this cool, famous musician who 
                      played on three Jackson Browne records.  
                      It is not enough.  And it s not enough 
                      for a father to take his son out to 
                      Phillies games three times a year and 
                      forget about him the rest of the days.  
                      It is not okay.  I want you to know the 
                      truth.  You re old enough now.   Look at 
                      you.  You re a young man now aren t you?  
                      How did that happen?  And for what it s 
                      worth you ll always have me.  And I m

                      be enough.

      In a rare moment Drew falls into her arms.  She holds him 
      like she never wants to let go.

        The mood is festive as the family makes their way toward 
        the school for Sydney s play.  Sydney is pumped with 
        energy, wearing her white tights and runs lines with 
        Zeek.  Julia holds her angel wings for her.  And Joel 
        videotapes it all.  The whole thing could not be cuter.  

        Haddie looks at Amber who gives her another cold stare.  
        Finally, Haddie can t take it anymore.  She approaches

      this is the hardest thing she has ever done.

                      pressure.  I m not that person.  And I 
                      can t pretend to be anymore.  Oh, yeah, 
                      full disclosure.  This is mine.

                      Okay.  So, I ll give you guys some time 
                      to discuss my punishment.  

        Haddie turns and walks into the auditorium trying to not 
        shake.  Adam and Kristina just look at each other.

                      When it rains it pours.

        Crosby walks up late, sees the weed.

                      Cool.  Where d that come from?

                                        SARAH
                      That ll teach you to show up late.



      Adam sits outside on the steps -- we can hear the sound 
      of five-year-olds singing from within.  Max is ten or 
        fifteen feet away continuously jumping off of a step onto 
        the ground.  Over and over.  Relentlessly.  The 
        loneliness of having an autistic kid.

      Zeek comes out.  Sizes up the situation.

                      miss the end.

                      He can t go in.

                      There are candles in the hallway.  He 
                      can t walk past them.

                      That s ridiculous.  He just needs to walk 
                      past them and he ll see that it s fine.

                      Dad.  It s not that simple.

                      Dad, there s something wrong with my son.  
                      There s something wrong.  

        And these words open up a flood gate.  To speak the most 
        dreaded thing on his mind is both empowering and 
        incredibly sad.

                      Something s wrong and I m going to need 
                      you to help me.

      Zeek stands there and looks at his son suddenly seeing 
        the little boy in him.
