  SLAM IN:


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY

  VARRO'S DEAD BODY lies on a table. Splattered with dried 
  blood. His FATAL WOUND an angry accusation. REVERSE TO FIND

  SPARTACUS

  standing at the foot of the table. The pain and guilt over 
  his part in ending Varro's life cloud his eyes. Sleep has 
  obviously evaded him. His knuckles are raw and cracked, and 
  he bears the scrapes and shallow cuts from his "exhibition" 
  match in episode 110. PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS as he flashes to 
  snippets of

  HIS FIGHT WITH VARRO (ALREADY SHOT)

  at the party for the Magistrate's son Numerius from episode 
  110. Blows are exchanged. Varro inflicts a shallow cut 
  across Spartacus' lower right side. Spartacus counters, 
  defeating Varro. NUMERIUS gives the thumbs down. Spartacus 
  plunges his sword down into Varro's chest, wrenching 
  Spartacus back to the present.

                                          DOCTORE (O.S.)
                      It is never an easy thing.

  DOCTORE appears. Spartacus' eyes remain fixed on Varro.

                                          DOCTORE
                      To see a friend once loved, now 
                        absent breath.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He should yet walk. With that 
                        foolish grin, and dreams of a life 
                        beyond these walls.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Every night breaks. And we must all 
                        wake.

  Spartacus grimaces, his hand dropping to the shallow wound 
  on his lower right side, inflicted by Varro.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would the gods turn back the 
                        sun... and set me in his place.

                      He fought with honor. As did you 
                        both.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  disgusted)(
                        His heart was stilled for a boy's 
                        amusement. Where is the honor in 
                        that?

                                          DOCTORE
                        Varro left this world a gladiator. 
                        And shall be remembered as such.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        No. He will be remembered as a 
                        husband. A father. And a friend 
                        among enemies.

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS' LUDUS/VILLA - DAY

  TIGHT ON CRIXUS as he spars with another MAN. He pauses, 
  glancing over at

  SPARTACUS

  carrying a litter burdened with Varro's body. Helping him as 
  pallbearers are HAMILCAR, RHASKOS, and an ND GLADIATOR. 
  Doctore leads them.

  THE OTHER GLADIATORS

  in the training square pause to pay their respects. DURO and 
  AGRON trade a somber look.

  VARRO'S BODY

  is carried to the gate where his wife AURELIA and young son 
  JANUS await. Varro's body is loaded onto the back of a cart. 
  Doctore nods to Aurelia. He and the other men then return to 
  the square. Spartacus lingers, attempting to find words to 
  express his sorrow.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Aurelia --

  She tears her shell-shocked gaze from her husband's face to 
  meet Spartacus' eyes.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

                      Is it true? That he perished by 
                        your sword?

  Face wracked with anguish, Spartacus nods. Tears spill down 
  Aurelia's face.

                                          AURELIA(cont'd)
                      He loved you as a brother.

  Spartacus can muster no response. As Aurelia turns away, 
  ANGLE UP TO --

  THE BALCONY

  LUCRETIA and BATIATUS gaze down at the proceedings. NAEVIA 
  attends in the background.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Spartacus will not take this loss 
                        well.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And who's to fucking blame him?

  Batiatus turns, angrily exits into --


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - CONTINUOUS

  Batiatus barely contains his wrath.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Calavius slaughters my stock at the 
                        whim of his maggot, then shits upon 
                      my ambitions, mocking me in my own 
                        house. No, a loss not to be taken 
                        fucking well. But one that shall be 
                        directly answered in kind.

  Lucretia waves Naevia out, not wanting her to overhear.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  hushed)(
                      He is the Magistrate. To move 
                        against him...

                                        BATIATUS
                      He is but a man. And all men fall, 
                        beneath the heel of their hubris.

                        What of Ilithyia? Has she moved to 
                        secure us her husband's patronage?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        She has departed to meet Glaber in 
                        Rome.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Welcome news. The support of a 
                        Legatus should be more than enough 
                      to gain political office. I only 
                        regret Calavius will not live to 
                        see the "unworthy" name of Batiatus 
                      so elevated.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You play a perilous game. The very 
                        thought of discovery...
                                  swallows)(
                      It turns the stomach.

  AULUS appears across the room. His face and cloak are 
  splattered with BLOOD.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Make it a thing of iron, and see it 
                        settled.

  He crosses to Aulus for private consultation. Lucretia 
  watches, tensing with worry.

  ON BATIATUS AND AULUS,

  well out of earshot of any SLAVES.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)

                        himself removed to the appointed 
                        place.

                        I shall accompany. I would gaze 
                        into the man's eyes, and see the 
                        power of my reflection in them. 
                        Avail yourself of my hospitality

                        Dominus.

  Aulus moves off. Batiatus watches him go, a dark smile 
  bending his lips. Lucretia approaches.

                        No. It has only just begun.

  OFF the ominous statement...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY

  SWORDS CLASH. The day's training is in full swing. Agron 
  trades blows with Spartacus. The champion is distracted and 
  unusually winded. His moves sloppy.

  CRIXUS

  glares at the lackluster display from across the square as 
  he hacks at a training palus. He grunts his disapproval to 
  Doctore nearby.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                        A heavy heart weighs a man's sword.

  Spartacus breaks off from sparring with Agron. He crosses to 
  the water barrel, out of breath.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The loss of a brother is felt by 
                        every gladiator. We honor him not 
                        with tears, but with blood spilled

                        primus by Solonius and his bribes.

                        The woman who grieves.

  BACK ON SPARTACUS

  as he drinks his water, sweat dripping from his increasingly 
  pallid skin. HECTOR appears, the burns on his face (from his 
  run-in with Spartacus in episode 110) still red and 
  inflamed. He glares, hating Spartacus almost as much as 
  Crixus.

                        was known to him, and accepted of 
                        free will.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      As a gladiator. Not a child's 
                        plaything.

  Batiatus sees the storm brewing within Spartacus. He nods in 
  agreement, seeking to abate it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The Magistrate and his whelp caused 
                      us both grievance. It will not go 
                        unanswered, I promise you.

  Spartacus picks up on the threat. His eyes blaze with 
  vengeance.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would be of service towards the 
                        deed.

                        toward the games against Pompeii. 
                        That perfumed shit Solonius always

                        tongue in ass, only to be crushed 
                      by our city's hated rival. But this 
                        year he falls out of favor. This 
                        year the House of Batiatus secures

                        You would do this? For Varro?

                        you would have peace of mind,

  Batiatus eyes Spartacus' less than stellar condition.

  INT. BATIATUS' VILLA - DAY

  Hector escorts Spartacus back to the ludus. A silent beat, 
  broken by Hector.

                                        HECTOR
                      It is regretful, what happened to 
                        Varro. I saw in your eyes how you 
                        craved to defy order of his death.

  Spartacus doesn't respond. Hector's eyes flash with hatred.

                                          HECTOR(cont'd)
                        A shame you did not attempt it.

  Spartacus darkens, but as they round a corner his attention 
  is drawn to

  A CHAMBER

  where a naked Aulus is being plied with oils by two SLAVE 
  GIRLS. RAMP UP TO SLOW MOTION AS WE PASS. Slave Girl #1 is 
  topless, standing behind Aulus, her hands sensually 
  caressing the villain's flesh. SLAVE GIRL #2 (clothed) sinks 
  to her knees in front of Aulus, her hand stroking

  THE SMOOTH, UNBROKEN SKIN

  OF HIS RIGHT SIDE (NO SCARS). She glances up as Spartacus 
  passes -- it's MIRA. Her eyes flash with shame. Spartacus 
  takes in the sight, numb to it as his passing WIPES US TO --


  INT. BATH - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  BEDLAM ensues as the Gladiators fight to get a look at the 
  list of matchups for the upcoming games (similar to scene 13 
  in Episode 103). Duro grabs the parchment from a man's hand. 
  Disgusted by what he reads.

                                        DURO
                        Goat-fuck! I knew it!

  Agron snatches it from him, scans it, grins.

                                        AGRON
                        Why do you fucking bleat? You fight 
                      at my side, brother!

                        Like a suckling babe. I would prove 
                        myself alone.

  Crixus snatches the list from Agron.

                                        CRIXUS
                        And die the same.

  Duro glares, moving off with Agron. Crixus eyes the list. 
  His face falls as he realizes he isn't on it. He angrily 
  thrusts the list at Rhaskos. Rhaskos scans it with a frown, 
  showing it to Hamilcar.

                                          RHASKOS
                        What do the markings say?

                        That you are fucked.

  They pass Spartacus, who is looking very much the worse for 
  wear. Sweat beads his skin as a SLAVE scrapes him down.

  AGRON

  eyes him as he begins oiling and scraping (being a lower 
  man, no slaves attend him).

                                        AGRON
                        Our Champion does not look to form.

                        For what offense?

                        You fucking jest. Varro's blood, 
                        still wet upon his hands?

                        And who would see to your brother's 
                        family?

  Spartacus' voice booms as he rises, sweat coursing down his 
  pale skin. The bath goes quiet as he gets in Duro's face, 
  pissed and wild-eyed. Crixus watches with fixed interest.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        What answer do you give, Duro? With 
                        both of you dead, who would see to 
                        his wife?! His fucking child?!

  Duro stammers, confused.

                                        DURO
                      My brother has no wife or child.

  But Spartacus isn't listening anymore. His heart seizes in 
  his chest as he spots

  DEAD VARRO

  gazing at him sadly from the bath's entrance. Splattered in 
  blood. His fatal wound still fresh and weeping. He turns and 
  exits.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Wait... Wait!

  Spartacus starts after him, shoving others out of the way as 
  he exits. Crixus laughs, calling out to the men.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Fucking Thracians.

  Muted chuckles. OFF CRIXUS, wondering if Spartacus' 
  instability offers opportunity...


  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus moves through the corridors in SLOW MOTION. He 
  catches maddening glimpses of Dead Varro as he pushes his 
  way past men gambling and laughing. He rushes after him, 
  bursting outside into --                                                                                    12.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus slows to a stop out on the sand. Confusion creases 
  his face as we reveal the TRAINING SQUARE IS EMPTY. 
  Spartacus blinks the sweat from his eyes, not comprehending.

  A HAND

  touches his shoulder, startling him. He whirls around to 
  find Mira has appeared behind him, her escort GUARD 
  lingering nearby. She regards Spartacus with concern.

                                        MIRA
                        Apologies. I called your name...

                        I did not hear.

  She notes his pale features, his red-rimmed eyes.

                        They do not deserve it.

                        Spartacus --

  He starts to turn away. Her hand reaches out to stop him, 
    accidentally grazing the wound on his side. He winces in 
  pain.

                                          MIRA(cont'd)

                        A scratch. Varro suffered worse.

                        I will help you to your cell.

                        Mira.

  She stops, hopeful.

                        The man I saw you with...

  She flushes with shame, launching into explanation.

                        I was ordered to tend to his needs.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Such is not my concern. The man was 
                        wounded trying to protect my wife. 
                        Next you lie with him, I would have 
                        you offer my gratitude.

  Spartacus then turns and heads for his cell. Mira watches 
  him go, longing for a spark of jealously or desire from the 
  champion. As Spartacus closes the cell door shut, SMASH CUT 
  TO --


  INT. CISTERN - CHAMBER - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON A SACK, as it is lifted from MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS' 
  head. He blinks, face battered, eyes adjusting to the light. 
  Batiatus looms over him. Aulus and ASHUR lurk in the 
  background.

  Batiatus snarls, kicking the chair back. The Magistrate 
  lands hard on the ground with a grunt.

  Batiatus grinds his heel against the Magistrate's neck,

  The Magistrate gasps for air under Batiatus' foot. Ashur

                        Apologies, Dominus. Perhaps if you 
                        removed your foot...?

  Batiatus glares, removes his foot from the Magistrate's 
  neck. He gestures to Ashur and Aulus to right the chair. The 
  Magistrate coughs and sputters. He locks eyes with Batiatus, 
  defiance flaring.

  Batiatus tries to laugh that off, but the Magistrate's words 
  pierce his deepest fears.

  The Magistrate starts to protest, but Batiatus tugs the sack 
  down over his head. The Magistrate thrashes, his muffled 
  screams echoing.

  Crixus fumes as he works the palus with his sword. He shoots 
  a venomous look over to --

  SPARTACUS

  who spars with Agron. Spartacus' condition has worsened. 
  Sweat drips off him. Breaths come in ragged gasps.

                      My brother... meant nothing by his

                      He spoke his mind. Thoughts... 
                        shared by many.

  Spartacus steps back, winded, half doubled over to catch his 
  breath.

                      If I do, I shall tell you.

  Spartacus attacks. Agron is forced back, but Spartacus 
  quickly tires. Agron counters, his wooden sword accidentally 
  landing a blow against Spartacus' wounded side. Spartacus 
  staggers back, agony shocking through him.

                                        DEAD VARRO (O.S.)
                        Did I hurt you...

  Startled, Spartacus looks up and sees Dead Varro standing in 
  Agron's place, practice sword in hand.

                        ... Champion?

  Spartacus blinks the sweat from his eyes. Now it is Agron 
  facing him. With a FERAL GROWL, Spartacus attacks with a 
  wild frenzy. Each time their swords clash,

  DEAD VARRO BRIEFLY FLASHES INTO EXISTENCE,

  taking Agron's place. Spartacus and Agron smash together, 
  locking swords. As Spartacus draws close, Agron is replaced

  Spartacus glances over to Doctore, joined by Crixus.

                        Does he intend to fight, or kiss 
                        the man?

  The other men laugh. Spartacus turns back to find Dead Varro 
  gone. Agron stands in his place, concern constricting his 
  face as he looks down at Spartacus' wound.

                        Spartacus...

  Spartacus gazes down. BLACK BLOOD streaked with PUS streams 
  down his leg from the wound in his side. He shoves Agron 
  back and starts to walk away, favoring his side. He only 
  makes it a few steps before his eyes unfocus and his legs 
  give out. As he hits the ground, SMASH TO --

                      of Pericles!

  Naevia glances out beyond the gate, worried Crixus will be 
  heard.

                                        NAEVIA
                        You must soften your words. We will 
                      be discovered.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Let them discover us. Tonight, I am 
                        a god! And I will reclaim my title 
                      as Champion of Capua...

  He pulls her into a kiss. He breaks off, sensing something 
  is wrong.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        The news does not please you.

                      It fills my heart with joy, to see 
                        you so alive.

                        Naevia --

                        The Primus is a fight to the death. 
                        You have been absent the arena for 
                        many months. If Pericles --

                      He will not.

                        How can you be certain?

  He takes her in with a reassuring smile, filled with love 
  and desire.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Because I will never leave your 
                        side. Death itself will tremble if 
                      it attempts to part us.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    21.

  Tears fill her eyes. He is her heart, and the beating of it 
  fills her with strength and hope.

                        Tomorrow when I claim victory, I 
                        will look to you in the pulvinus. 
                        The moment shall be ours alone.

  Crixus pulls Naevia into a kiss. She responds, melting into 
  him. He slips off her dress, the fall of the fabric WIPING 
  US TO --


  EXT. MARKETPLACE - CAPUA - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON A SMALL PURSE OF COINS being dropped into a hand. 
  POP WIDE to reveal SOLONIUS half in the shadows, paying 
  Ashur his weekly bribe. Ashur's hood is pulled up to conceal 
  his face from prying eyes.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Your hand is weighted. Now float 
                        your tongue.

                                        ASHUR
                        You are safe. My master has greater 
                        concerns requiring his attentions.

  Solonius smiles, hoping for the worst.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        What plagues good Batiatus to such 
                        distraction?

                                        ASHUR
                        Matters beyond your worries.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Yet they clearly trouble you. 
                        Confide, and lift your burden.

  Ashur hesitates, gives in to the temptation.

                                        ASHUR
                      He has grown reckless. His thirst 
                        for power and vengeance clouds 
                        judgement.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        How so?

  Ashur realizes he has said too much already.

                        I have taken too great a risk 
                        meeting with you this night. I must 
                      to the apothecary, before I am 
                        overdue.

  Ashur starts off. Solonius takes his arm, halting him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        One day, very soon, the House of 
                        Batiatus will come crashing down. 
                      Do not find yourself buried in the 
                        rubble.

  Solonius disappears into the night. OFF ASHUR, the warning 
  striking a deep cord...

  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus violently convulses, unconscious, the fever 
  consuming him. Medicus tries to force a cup of LIQUID down 
  his throat, but Spartacus is thrashing too much.

                                          MEDICUS
                        Fucking hold him down!

  Mira drops a compress, rushes over to assist. Medicus pours 
  his concoction into Spartacus' mouth. Spartacus sputters and 
  chokes, begins to calm. SLOW PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS' FACE. His 
  eyes suddenly SNAP OPEN. PULL BACK to reveal we are now --


  INT. BATH - BATIATUS' LUDUS - CONTINUOUS

  A DOZEN or so GLADIATORS scrape down after a long day of 
  training. Crixus sneers at Spartacus in contempt.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Lick my hole. The pig-fucker's 
                        still alive.

  Duro, Agron and the other men chuckle. An ATTENDING SLAVE 
  oils Spartacus and begins to scrape him. The Slave brushes 
  Spartacus' wound. Spartacus grimaces, glancing down to see






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.
  CONTINUED:

  THE SKIN SURROUNDING HIS WOUND

  curling up at the edges. He gingerly peels the inflamed 
  flesh back, revealing a glimmer of GOLD within the wound. 
  SPARTACUS'

  eyes widen in dawning horror as he opens the wound further 
  and GOLD COINS drop from within it. The coins strike the 
  ground, the sound huge in the stone room. The men LAUGH. 
  Spartacus looks up, shocked to see

  CRIXUS

  as a Slave scrapes his chest, the skin peeling back to 
  reveal SOLID GOLD below its surface. Crixus flashes a manic 
  grin.

  SPARTACUS

  stares in horror, tears his eyes from Crixus to see Agron, 
  Duro, and the rest of the men also being scraped down to the 
  GOLD beneath their flesh. SHEETS OF SKIN drift to the 
  flagstones at their feet like strips of curled parchment.

                                        DEAD VARRO (O.S.)
                        This is what you are to him.

  Spartacus looks to the Attending Slave, is stunned to see 
  him replaced by Dead Varro.

                                        DEAD VARRO
                        Gold, mined from blood and meat.

                                        DIANA (O.S.)
                        All hail Spartacus.

  Spartacus turns to find a WOMAN approaching, dressed like 
  Ilithyia from their sexual rendezvous in episode 109. THE 
  MASK OF DIANA stares at him, cold and impassive.

                                        DIANA
                        Slayer of the Shadow. Bringer of 
                        Rain.
                                (caressing his 
                                  chest)
                        Champion of the Romans...

  BLOOD leaks from the corner of her mouth, staining the 
  pristine mask. Spartacus reaches for it with a trembling 
  hand. He pulls it away, screams as the BLOOD SPLATTERED FACE 
  OF DEAD SURA is revealed (Note: Sura's blood and injuries 
  should match the end of episode 106).


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    24.

  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus SCREAMS, back arching in a rigid convulsion as he 
  thrashes. Mira and the Medicus struggle to lash his arms and 
  legs with LEATHER STRAPS. His HOWLS OF AGONY echo as we 
  SMASH TO --


  EXT. ARENA - CAPUA - DAY

  The CROWD roars as a HOPLOMACHUS collapses to the sand, 
  SCREAMING, blood gushing from his helmet.

  AGRON

  slams his sword through the Hoplomachus' back, his blade 
  coming out through the man's chest in a spray of blood. 
  Agron rips his own damaged helmet off, spotting

  DURO

  on his knees, a PROVOCATOR close to finishing him off as he 
  SLAMS his sword against Duro's shield.

                                        AGRON
                        Duro!

  He realizes he'll never reach him in time. In one fluid 
  movement, he grabs the dead Hoplomachus' spear and hurls it 
  with all his might.

  THE SPEAR

  slices through the air and SLAMS into the Provocator's 
  helmet in an explosion of blood and brains. He goes down, 
  twitches, lays still. The crowd roars.

  DURO

  wrenches off his helmet and rises, looking toward his 
  brother. Gratitude -- and shame -- well in his eyes. 

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus, Lucretia, NUMERIUS, DOMITIA and several other 
    distinguished CAPUANS clap excitedly. The POMPEII MAGISTRATE 
  and his ENTOURAGE look on, faces dour. Batiatus gloats.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    25.

                        These early skirmishes count for 
                        nothing. It is the Primus that 
                        decides the victor. Absent your man 
                        Spartacus, Capua shall once again 
                        find itself in Pompeii's shadow.

                        Perhaps Crixus shall bring light to 
                        the matter.

  Lucretia dabs at the sweat building on her brow, motions for 
  Naevia to bring her wine.

                                          POMPEII MAGISTRATE

                        alive.

                        Batiatus assures us he has 
                        recovered from his injuries.

                        That he survived at all is 
                        impressive. No gladiator from 
                        Pompeii ever lived against 
                        Theokoles.

                        short.

  Domitia shifts uncomfortably, forcing a smile.

  INT. CISTERNS - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

  Ashur moves down a corridor by the flickering light of an 
  OIL LAMP. He enters into --


  INT. CISTERNS - CHAMBER - DAY

  Ashur stops short. Aulus sleeps against the wall. The 
  Magistrate sits slumped in his chair, his head covered with 
  the burlap sack.

                                        ASHUR

  Aulus rises.

                        not stirred.

  Ashur holds the lantern up, peers at the Magistrate. Slumped 
  over. Lifeless. Ashur tenses, his heart catching in his 
  chest.

                                          AULUS(cont'd)
                        Rouse yourself, peacock!

  The Magistrate does not stir. Ashur glares.

                                          AULUS(cont'd)
                        Shit...

  Aulus pulls the sack from the Magistrate's head. His eyes 
  are closed, SPITTLE snaking from his mouth. Aulus leans 
  down, ear close to the Magistrate's face to catch signs of 
  breath.

                                        ASHUR
                        This is on you. I will share no 
                        part --

                                        AULUS
                        Quiet!

  A beat as Aulus listens. He breaks into a relieved smile, 
  glancing back to Ashur.

                                          AULUS(cont'd)
                      He breathes. I told you the man was 
                        still alive --

  The Magistrate's eyes suddenly slam open as he attacks with 
  a snarl, SINKING HIS TEETH INTO AULUS' NECK. Aulus shrieks.

                                        ASHUR
                        Aulus!

  Ashur rushes forward, tries to pull Aulus away. For a 
  moment, it's a tug-of-war. Finally, with a SICKENING RIP, he 
  tears Aulus free. Aulus screams, clutching his bleeding 
  neck.

  THE MAGISTRATE

  spits out a hunk of BLOODY FLESH, eyes alight, BLOOD running 
  down his chin, laughing.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.

                        I will see you both nailed to the 
                        cross! You and your fucking master 
                      --

  Aulus snarls, unleashes his fists on the Magistrate. Blood 
  and teeth fly.

                                        ASHUR
                        Aulus, enough! Aulus!

  Ashur pulls him back. The Magistrate groans, barely 
  conscious. Aulus breathes hard, his hand going to his neck.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Let me see.

  Ashur holds the lamp up, inspects the wound. It isn't 
  pretty.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Ugly as a whore's gash, but you 
                        will live. Return to the ludus and 
                        have Medicus attend to it.

                                        AULUS
                        You have the balls to see this 
                        through alone?

                                        ASHUR
                        Two of them. Very large. Go.

  Aulus exits. Ashur turns to the Magistrate, troubled. His 
  eyes fall to a BLOOD STAINED SIGNET RING on the Magistrate's 
  finger. OFF ASHUR, weighing the consequences of what he's 
  been commanded to do...


  EXT. ARENA - NIGHT

  The sands are absent gladiators. The crowd BOOS and throws 
  garbage at the lack of action.


  INT. CHUTES - ARENA - NIGHT

  Crixus paces like a caged animal. Doctore stands at the 
  gate, looking out at the empty arena.

                                        CRIXUS
                      We wait an eternity. Why do they 
                        not begin the Primus?                                                                                    29.


  EXT. PULVINUS - ARENA - NIGHT

  The Pompeii Magistrate huffs at the din of the crowd.

                                          POMPEII MAGISTRATE
                        The crowd threatens riot. We can 
                        await Calavius no longer.

  Domitia tries to hide the concern for her absent husband as 
  she turns to Batiatus.

                                          DOMITIA
                        Good Batiatus. Would you present 
                        the Primus in my husband's place?

                                        BATIATUS
                      If you think it proper...

                                          DOMITIA
                        Please.

  Batiatus catches Lucretia's eye, a twinkle sparkling in his 
  own. He rises, holds up his hands for silence. The CHANTING 
  dies down.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Capua! In honor of Magistrate 
                        Calavius, who is absent attending 
                        vital business on your behalf, I 
                        present the Primus against Pompeii!

  The CROWD roars in excitement. The Capuans begin chanting 
  Spartacus' name. Batiatus shifts nervously, puts on his best 
  smile.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yes! Yes, we all desire to see 
                        Spartacus, the Bringer of Rain, 
                        take the sands in victory! But 
                        sadly this day shall not see him 
                        with sword in hand!

  The crowd reacts with shock, BABBLING CONFUSION.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yet there is cause to rejoice! This 
                      is a glorious moment, much 
                        anticipated! For it marks the 
                        return to the arena of Capua's 
                        favored son... Crixus! Murmillo!

  A wave of dismay washes across the crowd, erupting in BOOS 
  THAT CARRY US INTO...                                                                                    30.


  INT. CHUTES - ARENA - NIGHT

  CLOSE ON CRIXUS, stone-faced but unable to mask his hurt 
  pride from the crowd's reaction. Doctore glowers.

                                        CRIXUS
                        They have forgotten the honor I 
                        have brought them.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Then it is time you reminded them 
                        who their true champion is.

  A proud look from teacher to student. Crixus gathers 
  himself, pulling on his helmet as he steps out into --


  EXT. ARENA - NIGHT

  Crixus takes the sand. He's greeted with a rousing chorus of 
  BOOS.

  PULVINUS

  The Pompeii Magistrate chuckles.

                                          POMPEII MAGISTRATE
                      It appears Capua does not care for 
                        your selection.

  Lucretia forces a smile, looking somewhat ill. Batiatus 
  glares at the remark, returns to the crowd.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He faces a most vile opponent, 
                        belched from the bowels of Pompeii. 
                        I give you Pericles! Thraex!

  ARENA

  PERICLES enters. A huge, chiseled GREEK (or Numidian god, 
  depending on casting). He raises his sword in honor to the 
  Pompeii Magistrate.

  PULVINUS

  The Pompeii Magistrate waves to Pericles, delighted.

                                          POMPEII MAGISTRATE
                        I pray the match will be overly 
                        brief!



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                                  Batiatus)
                        I would see his fat smirk removed. 
                        Give the command.

  Batiatus gives the signal to Crixus and Pericles.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Begin!

  ARENA

  Crixus attacks, driving Pericles back. The Crowd cheers and 
  groans, depending on which side they're rooting for. Crixus 
  assaults Pericles like a man possessed, landing devastating 
  blows.

  PERICLES COUNTERS,

  redirecting the assault back on Crixus. Crixus goes on the 
  defensive. Pericles swings around and slams his shield into 
  Crixus' helmet. BLOOD FLIES from Crixus' face plate.

  CRIXUS STAGGERS BACK

  ss Pericles presses his attack. His sword slices through 
  Crixus' manica (forearm guard), the SPLASH OF BLOOD WIPING 
  US TO --


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON A BLEEDING WOUND. WIDEN TO REVEAL Medicus applying 
  a bandage to Aulus' neck.

                                          MEDICUS
                        What was the fucking cause?

                                        AULUS
                        A dog, soon to be put down.

  Medicus grunts, pinches some POWDER into a cup of wine.

                                          MEDICUS
                        Drink.

                        Smells like piss.

                                          MEDICUS
                        Henbane. To help you rest.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.
  CONTINUED:

  Aulus knocks it back with a grimace, stretches out on the 
  table. Medicus stifles a yawn, barks to Mira tending to 
  Spartacus across the room.

                                          MEDICUS(cont'd)
                        I need food and a few hours sleep. 
                        Come for me if his condition 
                        changes.

  Mira nods and Medicus exits. Mira wrings out a wet cloth, 
  gingerly places it across Spartacus' fevered brow. OFF her 
  concern...


  EXT. ARENA - NIGHT

  A CLASH OF STEEL as Pericles and Crixus trade thunderous 
  blows. TIME SLOWS as Pericles lands a devastating blow. 
  Crixus slams to the ground, his helmet dislodging from the 
  impact. Pericles struts for the Crowd, milking the moment.

  PULVINUS

  The Pompeii Magistrate laughs at the display.

                        Look! He yet rises --

  Lucretia herself rises from her chair, only to stagger, her 
  legs betraying her.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Lucretia!

  He eases her back into her chair, calls to Naevia.

                        slaughtered.

  Batiatus throws him a toxic glance. He takes the water from 
  Naevia, holds it to Lucretia's lips.

                                          DOMITIA
                        Slowly.

  Lucretia swallows, gaining her bearing.

                        Apologies. The heat...

                      No argument. I will join you 
                        afterwards.

  He gives her a pointed look. Lucretia nods, reluctantly 
  giving in.

  Naevia helps Lucretia up, throwing a desperate glance at her 
  love battling for his life down in the arena as she exits.

  ARENA

  Crixus is getting hammered. Pericles again sends him to the 
  ground. The crowd boos, throwing garbage. Crixus gets 
  pelted. His eyes narrow, the crowd's mockery igniting him. 
  He spits blood, rises to lock eyes with Pericles with a look 
  that says: "Is that all you got?" 

  PERICLES

  nods at the challenge, charges. They slam into each other, 
  titans clashing in a fight for the ages. Crixus spins and 
  deflects, counters and attacks. Pericles is forced on the 
  defensive as he's hammered back.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.
  CONTINUED:

  THE CROWD ROARS,

  sensing the shift in momentum. The Capuan fans begin 
  CHANTING Crixus name. He gains strength from it, a grim 
  smile forming.

  TIME SLOWS

  as Crixus executes a full 180 degree spin, his blade slicing 
  Pericles' stomach open in a CASCADE OF BLOOD. 

  PERICLES

  drops hard to his knees, VISCERA SPILLING from the yawning 
  wound and SLAPPING THE SAND. He looks up at Crixus for a 
  stunned beat before collapsing to the sand. Crixus raises 
  his boot and brings it down hard,

  CRUSHING PERICLES' HELMET

  in an explosion of GORE AND BRAINS. The Crowd goes insane. 
  Crixus thrusts his arms up in victory, beaming -- but his 
  smile fades as he looks up to...

  THE PULVINUS

  ...and discovers Naevia is absent. Batiatus steps into the 
  FRAME, roaring his approval at Crixus' victory.

                        The match was overly brief.

  Batiatus laughs. The Pompeii Magistrate scowls, rising.

                        Good fortune to Capua, and all its

                        Linger a moment! Let us have drink 
                        and relive the glorious --

  Batiatus is interrupted by a MESSENGER, escorted by a GUARD.

                                          MESSENGER
                        Dominus...

  He hands Batiatus a message scroll. Batiatus takes it, waves 
  the man away as he reads.

                        What news so urgent it interrupts 
                        the gloating of good Batiatus?

  The Pompeii entourage chuckles. Batiatus tenses at what he 
  reads.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The Magistrate's caravan has been 
                        discovered at the edge of town. His 
                        guards murdered.

                                          DOMITIA
                        No.

                        What of my father?

                                        BATIATUS
                      He was not among them. Yet there 
                        were tracks, leading into the city.

                                          DOMITIA
                        Back to Capua? Why would anyone 
                        commit such treachery?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Ransom... or simple mischief on 
                        such a day.

  Batiatus throws an accusatory glance at the Pompeii 
  Magistrate, who bristles at the implication.

                        The matter is of Capua.

  A tense beat. Domitia barely holds back the tears, siding 
  with Batiatus.

  The Pompeii Magistrate bows, exits with his entourage.

                        I shall gather my men to aid in the

                        Domitia. You have my oath on it.

  Domitia hesitates, gives in with a nod.

  OFF BATIATUS, his eyes barely masking the sinister intent of 
  his words...


  EXT. MARKETPLACE - CAPUA - NIGHT

  A CITY SEARCH PARTY (not Batiatus) passes by with torches. 
  Ashur disengages from the shadows, maneuvering down the 
  street to where Solonius awaits.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You send message, yet I wait as a 
                        common slave.

                                        ASHUR
                        Apologies. It was difficult to move 
                        without notice.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The alarm is up across the city. 
                        Speak quickly. I join the search 
                        for good Calavius. He has gone 
                        missing.

                                        ASHUR
                        I am aware of his absence. The very 
                        matter I wish to broach.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    37.
  CONTINUED:

  Ashur presses something into Solonius' hand. He examines it, 
  stunned to find the BLOODY SIGNET RING OF CALAVIUS.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Calavius' ring!

                                        ASHUR
                        Softly!

  Solonius pulls Ashur into the shadows, lowering his voice.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        How did you come by this?

                                        ASHUR
                        Through means pressing upon your 
                        desires. Batiatus holds him 
                        captive, with intent of murder.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Madness, even for Batiatus.

                                        ASHUR
                        Magistrate Calavius insults him, 
                        obstructs his ambitions. I have 
                        never seen Batiatus so unhinged. I 
                        would sever bonds, least I find 
                        myself upon the cross beside him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Calavius. He yet lives?

                                        ASHUR
                        For the briefest of moments.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Where is he held?

  Ashur hesitates.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        You speak of severing bonds, yet 
                        remain firmly tethered!

                                        ASHUR
                        I hold no love for old loyalties, 
                        yet Calavius has seen my face! I 
                        must flee this city, and would have 
                        proper means to do so.

  Solonius tears off his purse and shoves it into Ashur's 
  hands.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

                        Take it. And more, once Batiatus 
                        and his treachery are laid to rest. 
                        Come, we must gather men.

                                        ASHUR
                        Calavius will be dead before you 
                        do. Batiatus already moves towards 
                        his plan. Are you armed?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A simple dagger --

                        Enough to cut the ropes. Quickly! 
                      Or see opportunity fade!

  Ashur hustles off, fear flashing across his face. Solonius 
  follows with an excited grin, WIPING US TO --


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Aulus lies on a table, pale and unconscious. BLOOD seeps 
  through the bandage on his neck. Mira frowns at him as she 
  passes with a basin of fresh water, not caring for the 
  memory of his hands on her. She kneels beside

  SPARTACUS,

  gently wipes his fevered brow with a cool compress. As she 
  moves to wring it out his eyes flicker and slowly open. He 
  blinks, painfully adjusting to consciousness. POP WIDE to 
  REVEAL we are now in --


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT (DREAM)

  Dark. Empty. No sign of Mira or Aulus. Spartacus sits up, 
    disoriented. FILTERED MOONLIGHT falls through the barred 
  windows. A LIGHT WIND blows DEAD LEAVES through the doorway. 
  The Infirmary appears LONG-ABANDONED, shelves of scrolls and 
  clay jars shrouded with DUSTY COBWEBS.

                                          SPARTACUS

                        Medicus...?

  He is answered only by the WIND. He coughs, starts to rise, 
  freezes. He's no longer alone. Someone now lies on the 
  center table (where Varro's body rested in scene 1), covered 
  by a


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

  PRISTINE WHITE SHROUD

  that rises and falls with each breath. Spartacus stares in 
  mute dread. His hand reaches out to pull the shroud back, 
  but before he can the figure beneath STOPS BREATHING.

  SPOTS OF BLOOD BLOSSOM

  on the fabric, SOAKING THROUGH AND GROWING. Spartacus steels 
  himself and yanks the shroud back, revealing

  DEAD THRACIAN SPARTACUS,

  his throat hacked open from the killing wound Spartacus 
  inflicted in the arena (in Episode 107). Spartacus stares in 
  horror and confusion.

                                        DEAD SURA (O.S.)
                      He was so beautiful...

  Spartacus whips his eyes over to the doorway, shocked to see 
  Dead Sura. Though pale, she is no longer the blood-drenched 
  horror show from his last nightmare. She wears her Thracian 
  dress from episode 101.

                                        DEAD SURA
                        Why did you kill him?

                                  welling with tears)(
                        I had no choice. A man must accept 
                        his fate --

  Spartacus turns back to Thracian Spartacus, only to discover 
  that it's now DEAD VARRO on the table. Dead Sura is suddenly 
  right beside Spartacus.

                                        DEAD SURA
                      Or be destroyed by it.

  Spartacus begins to break down, wracked by guilt.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      Is this my path? Blood and death?

                                        DEAD SURA
                        You have always been destined for 
                        unfortunate things...

  She gently kisses him. He slowly responds, the tears 
  staining his cheeks as he loses himself in the kiss -- until 
  BLOOD BEGINS LEAKING FROM BETWEEN THEIR PRESSED LIPS. He 
  pulls back, horrified to discover he's now in --                                                                                    40.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT (DREAM)

  Spartacus, wearing his ORNATE SNAKE ARMOR, cradles DYING 
  SURA in his arms near the back of the transport wagon 
  (replaying the end of episode 106).

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Please... Do not leave me again...

                                        DYING SURA

                      It was you... who left...

  The life fades from her eyes. Spartacus sobs, holding her 
  close. A light wind kicks up. Spartacus' heart cracks as he 
  realizes he's no longer holding Sura in his arms, only her 
  DEATH SHROUD. It slips from his fingers, the wind taking it. 
  ADJUST TO FIND Dead Varro standing behind Spartacus.

                                        DEAD VARRO
                        You must tend to the wound.

  Spartacus looks up as Batiatus passes him (dressed as he was 
  at the end of 106). Batiatus steps up onto the wagon wheel 
  to consult with the DRIVER. Spartacus rises to follow. 
  Batiatus steps away, revealing a BLOOD-SPLATTERED AULUS 
  clutching his wounded side.

                                        AULUS
                        Attacked... on the road...

  Spartacus is suddenly roughly shoved by DEAD VARRO, now 
  dressed as Hector the guard, propelling us to --


  INT. BATIATUS' VILLA - DAY (DREAM)

  Dead Varro dressed as Hector escorts Spartacus (now in his 
  subligaria) back to the ludus (replaying scene 6). 
  Spartacus' attention is drawn to

  A CHAMBER

  where a naked Aulus is being plied with oils by two SLAVE 
  GIRLS. Slave Girl #1 is topless, standing behind Aulus, her 
  hands sensually caressing the villain's flesh. SLAVE GIRL #2 
  (clothed) sinks to her knees in front of Aulus, her hand 
  stroking

  THE SMOOTH, UNBROKEN SKIN

  OF HIS RIGHT SIDE (NO SCARS). She glances up as Spartacus 
  passes -- only now it is DEAD SURA (no blood) dressed as 
  Mira from before. Her eyes flash with pain and regret.

                        Tend to the wound.

  Spartacus stares in confusion -- then finally understands, 
  his eyes locking onto Aulus' side where he was supposed to 
  have been cut open protecting Sura. There is no scar, no 
  blemish, no trace of the injury. The wound was a lie.

  SPARTACUS SCREAMS

  as Aulus (now dressed as he was at the end of 106) suddenly 
  stabs Dead Sura (also dressed from 106) in the chest. As the 
  blade sinks into her flesh, SMASH TO --


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus bursts awake, the scream lingering on his lips. 
  Mira, startled, tries to calm him.

                        I am here. Be still...

  Spartacus tries to get his bearings, eyes wild, the leather

  Spartacus' eyes fall on Aulus, still asleep in his Henbane-
  induced haze. A grim smile bends Spartacus' parched, cracked 
  lips.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Yes. They have.

                        I would speak to this man. Alone.

  Mira eyes Aulus, not understanding -- nor liking the tone in 
  Spartacus' voice.

  EXT. MARKETPLACE - CAPUA - NIGHT

  Batiatus, Numerius and a knot of Batiatus' ARMED GUARDS 
  (including Hector) move through the streets.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        There is no sign of him. My father 
                        could be held anywhere.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He is a man much esteemed, and 
                        easily recognized.

  Batiatus artfully pauses across from the gated entrance to 
  the cisterns. An ancient corbel arch of crumbling stone, 
  flanked by two iron TORCH SCONCES, flagstone steps leading 
  down into darkness.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        How could he be moved through the 
                        streets without notice?

                                        NUMERIUS
                                (frustrated, near 
                                  tears)
                        I do not know.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Think. There must be a way...

  Numerius' eyes fall on the entrance to the cisterns.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        The cisterns! They run beneath the 
                        city and beyond!

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

                        Torches! Wrest the gate open!

  The Guards hustle to comply. Batiatus clasps Numerius' 
  shoulder in reassurance.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You will soon be with your father, 
                        Numerius. You have my word.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Your part in this shall not be 
                        forgotten.

  Numerius pushes his fears aside as he heads down into the 
  cisterns.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  softly, to himself)(
                        No, it shall not.

  Batiatus and his Guards follow Numerius down into the bowels 
  of the city, WIPING US TO --


  INT. CISTERN - CHAMBER - NIGHT

  ON MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS, slumped in his chair, unconscious, 
  sack over his head. A beat. DIM LIGHT floods the chamber as 
  we adjust to find Ashur appear with a torch, Solonius at his 
  side in the mouth of the chamber.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Calavius --

  He starts forward, but Ashur stops him, hearing the sound of 
  MEN approaching.

                                        ASHUR
                        Wait. They approach!

                                        SOLONIUS
                      We must hurry.

                                        ASHUR
                        No, it is too late.

  Ashur panics, turns to flee. Solonius grabs his arm.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Steel your fucking nerve!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

                        I will not end murdered for you or 
                        any man! Consider Ashur a spirit, 
                        and Capua the world he left behind!

  He wrenches free, dropping his torch as he scurries off into 
  the darkness.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  a harsh whisper)(
                        Ashur!

  He is gone. Batiatus' approach echoes in the distance. 
  Solonius hustles over to Calavius, whipping out his dagger.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                                (hissed, to

                        They are upon us! We must get you 
                        free...

  As he begins cutting the Magistrate's blood-soaked ropes...

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


  INT. CISTERNS - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

  RAMP TO SLOW MOTION as Numerius leads the way through the 
  dank cisterns. Behind him Batiatus subtly nods to Hector and 
  his Guards. They unsheathe their swords, unnoticed by 
  Numerius.


  INT. CISTERNS - CHAMBER - NIGHT

  Solonius finishes cutting the Magistrate loose (still in 
  SLOW MOTION). The Magistrate tumbles from the chair, the 
  sack over his head dislodging as he hits the ground. 
  Solonius' eyes widen with horror as he sees

  THE MAGISTRATE IS ALREADY DEAD,

  eyes open but unseeing, his THROAT SLIT.

                                        NUMERIUS (O.S.)
                        Solonius!

  Solonius spins, RAMPING US BACK TO NORMAL SPEED. Numerius 
  stands in the entrance with Batiatus and his armed Guards. 
  Solonius glances down at the knife in his hand, slick from 
  the blood on the ropes. He is officially fucked.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                        Seize him!

  Batiatus' men rush forward. Solonius makes a break for it, 
  slashing at the Guards with his knife. Hector catches him 
  hard across the face with the pommel of his sword. Solonius 
  smashes to the ground, dazed, spitting blood.

  NUMERIUS

  rushes to his dead father, the tears flowing as he cradles 
  his gory remains.

                                        NUMERIUS
                                  sobbing)(

                                        BATIATUS
                      We shall see him avenged. Solonius 
                        will suffer for what he has done.

  Solonius spots Ashur emerging from the shadows behind 
  Batiatus' men, a smile bending his lips. As if he had always 
  been there.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And all of Capua will know him for 
                        the shit that he is.

  Solonius looks up at Batiatus through the blood and pain as 
  the realization slams into him that his enemy just set him 
  up. WHAM! Batiatus brings his foot down on Solonius' face, 
  directly at CAMERA, SMASHING US TO BLACK.


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON AULUS' ROBES as they are roughly torn open. WIDEN 
  TO REVEAL an unsteady Spartacus standing over the 
  unconscious man, searching his torso for the injury received 
    "protecting" Sura. There is NO SIGN OF A SCAR, the skin 
  smooth and unbroken. Aulus' hand suddenly shoots out, 
  grabbing Spartacus' wrist.

                                        AULUS
                        What are you doing?!

  Spartacus locks eyes with the groggy Aulus.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

                      We were attacked, on the road. They

                        wound you earned trying to save my 
                        wife?

  A tense beat. Aulus knows he's in trouble. He suddenly 
  surges up.

                                        AULUS
                        Guard --

  But Spartacus is on him, his arm constricting around Aulus' 
  throat from behind. Aulus gasps for air.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Why?! Tell me!

                        life? Who?!

  Tears stain Spartacus' face. Aulus gasps, blood from his 
  injured neck flowing.

                                        AULUS
                                  a harsh whisper)(

  CONTINUED:

  Spartacus' eyes blacken with pure, primordial rage as he 
  tightens his grip. Blood pours from Aulus' mouth. He 
  convulses, lies mercifully still.

  SPARTACUS RISES,

  drained and shattered by the revelation that his life has 
  been a lie, perpetrated by a man he had come to trust. He 
  barely registers Mira, now standing horrified in the 
  doorway.

                        and never speak of this.

  They heave Aulus' body onto the table. As it crashes down --

  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS' LUDUS/VILLA - DAY

  Aulus' body is SLAMMED into the bed of a CART (the same one 
  Sura arrived on in Ep. 106). PULL WIDE to REVEAL several 
  GUARDS stepping away, done with taking out the trash. ANGLE 
  ON --

  THE BALCONY

  Where Batiatus and Ashur bear witness to Aulus' final exit.

                                        ASHUR
                        The wound did not appear fatal.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The damage was deeper than the eye 
                        could perceive. Medicus tells he 
                        drowned in his own blood.

                                        ASHUR
                        A loose end. No longer needing to 
                      be tied.

  Batiatus grins at that, his mood bright.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

                        Solonius was easily deceived by 
                        your offer to betray me. As I knew 
                      he would be.

                                        ASHUR
                      He never suspected my loyalty 
                        always lay with you, Dominus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A man who has no honor cannot 
                        imagine such a trait in others. But 
                        you, you possess the quality above 
                        all others. And shall be rewarded 
                      in kind.

                                        ASHUR
                        Your will, Dominus.

  Ashur smiles, in his element. Something draws Batiatus' 
  attention down in the square.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The gods truly favor the House of 
                        Batiatus! Behold! Spartacus has 
                        risen from the dead!

  Ashur follows his gaze down to --

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Spartacus, looking pale but much better, has taken to the 
  sand. Crixus and the other men are already training. 
  Spartacus arms himself with practice swords, pausing as 
  Batiatus calls to him.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Spartacus! The heart stirs to see 
                        you among the living! You are well?

  TIGHT PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS as he REPLIES:

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Yes, Dominus. I am myself again.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

  OFF SPARTACUS, the proclamation holding a deeper truth, one 
  filled with vengeance yet to come...

                                                                            BLACKOUT.
