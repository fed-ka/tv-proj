Grady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is
in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college
STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop.
GRADY
...listening to her father's boots scrape like
chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then
grow faint, then disappear altogether.'
As he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN,
perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE
BANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads:
WELCOME TO WORDFEST
GRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if
they've been on a field trip to the DMV.
GRADY (cont'd)
(a wave of the pages)
So. .Anyone?
A GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN
sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. He is JAMES
LEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the
window.
CARRIE MCWHIRTY
Let me get this straight. The girl with the
big lips is depressed because, each night, when
her father goes off to work at the bakery, her
mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the
house. Not only does this girl have to listen
to her mother working this guy in the next
room, she has to wash the sheets each morning
before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of
this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy
takes her to confession--only, once she gets in
the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and
realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is
that it?
James Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY
OVERCOAT he wears.
CARRIE MCWHIRTY
I mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics?
GRADY
All right. Let's try to keep it constructive,
shall we? Howard, what about you?
HOWARD
I hated it.
GRADY
That's not exactly what I meant by
constructive, Howard.
HOWARD
I think James should try to be more
constructive. This is my second semester with
him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me
want to kill myself.
GRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive.
Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the
raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN.
GRADY
Yes, Hannah?
HANNAH GREEN
I think maybe we're missing the point. It
seems to me James' strength as a writer is that
he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us
like adults. He respects us enough to forget
us. That takes . . . courage .
GRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative.
GRADY
Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I
think.
(as the students rise)
Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And
remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to
tonight's cocktail party need to have them at
the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30.
Hannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady.
GRADY
Thanks for that. He all right?
HANNAH GREEN
I think so. ..What about you?
GRADY
Me? Sure. Why?
HANNAH GREEN
Just checking.
GRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY
BOOTS, then starts to exit himself.
JAMES LEER
Turn out the light, please.
GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back
of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the
wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.
GRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL,
45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful
of SLICK PROGRAMS.
SARA
(calm but firm)
No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for
today. This means we have no programs for the
weekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at
9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw
Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are
going.
(shaking her head)
It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it.
GRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him.
There is the slightest of hesitations, then....
SARA
Professor Tripp.
GRADY
Chancellor.
SARA
I got the message you called.
GRADY
I got the message you called too.
This hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and
continue on, without so much as a backward glance.
The RADIO BLASTS as GRADY pops the glove box, removes a
JOINT as big as his pinky, and wheels his DARK MAROON '66
GALAXIE RAGTOP away from campus, cruising under another
BANNER:
WELCOME TO WORDFEST FEBRUARY 26-28
GRADY rides the long, automated treadmill that runs half
the length of the terminal, until...
...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the
tunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black
dress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels.
Grinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the
woman's ear, then spots Grady.
CRABTREE
Tripp!
GRADY
How are you, Crabtree?
CRABTREE
Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss
Antonia. . .uh. . . .
WOMAN
Sloviak.
CRABTREE
I took the liberty of inviting Antonia to
tonight's festivities. You don't mind, do you.
Trip? ?
GRADY
(a slight beat)
The more the merrier.
MISS SLOVIAK
Terry was telling me about you on the plane.
It was ail so interesting.
CRABTREE
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes
to be published. What you do as a writer, what
I do as an editor...
GRADY
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for
spelling.
MISS SLOVIAK
(indicating Crabtree)
That's exactly what he said.
CRABTREE
We know each other pretty well.
(to Grady)
So where's Emily?
GRADY
Emily?
CRABTREE
Your wife.
GRADY
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
CRABTREE
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
GRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the
architecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in
her spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree.
GRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak
sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.
CRABTREE
Do you know how many times I've boarded an
airplane praying someone like her would sit
down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my
way to Pittsburgh.
GRADY
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great
cities.
CRABTREE
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no
argument from me.
GRADY
She's a transvestite.
CRABTREE
You're stoned.
GRADY
She's still a transvestite.
CRABTREE
Mm.
GRADY
Isn't she?
Crabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he
watches the carousel spin.
CRABTREE
So how's the book?
GRADY stiffens. He had been expecting this, but not so
soon. He tries to act casual.
GRADY
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort
of. ..tinkering with it.
CRABTREE
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it
sometime this weekend. Think that might be
possible?
GRADY
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . .
juncture .
CRABTREE
I thought you were tinkering.
GRADY
I just mean. . .
CRABTREE
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you,
Tripp. But...
(pointedly)
...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
GRADY ponders this, troubled by it. Suddenly, Crabtree's
face brightens again.
CRABTREE
Ah. ..well now. What do you suppose that would
be?
GRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto
the carousel.
GRADY
That would be a tuba.
8
As the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the
great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance,
then glances in the rearview mirror.
GRADY
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It
wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
MISS SLOVIAK
Why yes. How did you know?
GRADY
Lucky guess.
CRABTREE
You didn't actually purchase this car, did
you. Trip??
GRADY
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
CRABTREE
He owes God money. You know, he queered
himself for good with Esquire.
GRADY takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto
butane.
GRADY
He said something about being between things.
CRABTREE
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken
legs.
GRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA.
AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound, as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of
famous big-leaguers. In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM MAN
IN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with
PITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game. As
Sara eases the door shut, GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEE'S
PENNANT hanging over the mantle.
GRADY
New?
SARA
(nodding)
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
Sara takes Grady's hand, drawing him away from the
pennant and down onto the coat-covered bed.
SARA
You go first.
GRADY
All right. This morning--
SARA
I'm pregnant.
A flash of LAUGHTER flutters from the living
room below.
GRADY starts to speak.
SARA
I'm sure.
GRADY
Well. This is...surprising. Does Walter... ?
SARA
I think Walter would find this a little more
than surprising.
GRADY nods, getting her drift, then roils onto his back.
GRADY
Emily left me this morning.
SARA
She's left before...
GRADY
She's left the room before. She always came
back.
Sara nods. Considers this.
SARA
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry
each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
GRADY
Simple.
GRADY and Sara stare at the ceiling. Sara sniffs the coat
lying beneath her. Miss Sloviak's coat.
SARA
Is that Cristaile?
GRADY
Hm.
SARA
(weary)
My God, I wear the same scent as a
transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't:
she?
GRADY
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is
by the end of the evening.
SARA
Has he asked to see the book yet?
GRADY
Yes.
SARA
And? Are you going to tell him?
GRADY
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm
going to do.
SARA
(distantly)
Neither do 1.
GRADY starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath Sara.
GRADY
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
SARA
I guess you're going to have to chew it off
then.
Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by
Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree,
returning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds
MISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's.
CRABTREE
Walter! I see you've met my friend.
WALTER GASKELL
Yes . She' s charming.
MISS SLOVIAK
(taking her drink)
Walter's been telling me the most fascinating
things about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it?
WALTER GASKELL
Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my
contention that their marriage tapped into the
very id of American popular culture. Joe
DiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking,
the Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be
controversial, I personally believe every
woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn
Monroe.
MISS SLOVIAK
Oh, I couldn't agree more.
NEW ANGLE
GRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and
changes course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN
("Q"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's
clear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting
the make on Hannah Green.
Q
And while my latest has been on the New York
Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't
help but lament that my first book, which
contains what I consider my finest writing, was
remaindered in less than five. So, I find
myself conflicted.
GRADY
Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in
the Hamptons.
HANNAH GREEN
(brightening)
Grady.
Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass.
Q
Hello.. .Professor.
GRADY
Q,. Hannah's had two stories published in The
Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A'
material for her.
As GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the
other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN
TWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN.
MAN IN TWEED
(to short man)
A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm
telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob
laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa?
Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot
bookstore like they need another goddamn cow.
(as GRADY passes)
Grady!
GRADY
Hello, Nathan.
MAN IN TWEED
My God, I haven't seen you since, what? The
PEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for
you, Grady.
(to his friend)
GRADY was there for Arsonist's Daughter,
The short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand.
SHORT MAN
Douglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not when I
say Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon
of late twentieth century fiction. I've had it
on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years
running.
GRADY
(pulling away)
No wonder it's still in print.
As GRADY flees, he passes a WOMAN holding a cigarette.
WOMAN WITH CIGARETTE
...can take my word for it, writer's are lousy
fucks. Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to
deal with the sweater thing. They'll discover
the cancer in your heart every time, but God
forbid they find a decent dry cleaner.
It's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks James past
the departing guests and toward the stairs.
HANNAH GREEN
Hey, you two.
GRADY stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer.
HANNAH GREEN (cont'd)
Are you riding with me, James?
JAMES LEER
No, I'm going ho--
GRADY
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his
friend. All right?
HANNAH GREEN
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
GRADY
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know.
Where are they exactly?
CRABTREE
Here we are!
CRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss
Sloviak. Her lipstick is blurry.
CRABTREE
(spying James)
Nell, hello there.
CRABTREE steps down the stairs, hand extended. James
Leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string.
GRADY
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
HANNAH GREEN
James'll know about George Sanders.
JAMES LEER
George Sanders?
HANNAH GREEN
Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders
killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
JAMES LEER
Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel
room.
The few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but
Crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue.
CRABTREE
How comprehensive of you.
HANNAH GREEN
Oh, James is amazing. He knows all the movie
suicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else.
JAMES LEER
There's so many...
HANNAH GREEN
Just a few then. The big ones.
James glances at the loose group of people around him,
watching, then...
JAMES LEER
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles
Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth,
1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an
accident, but, you know. . .
(a trace of irony)
He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took
pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he
hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in
lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more
pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget
when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot
himself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979.
Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret
Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills.
Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in
1978. There are more but I don't know if you
would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara
Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
HANNAH GREEN
I haven't heard of half of those.
CRABTREE
You did them alphabetically.
James turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him. James
blinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs
shyly, looks away.
JAMES LEER
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
CRABTREE
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out
with us after the lecture. There's a place on
the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
JAMES LEER
Actually. ..I just want to go home.
CRABTREE
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants
to go home. Besides, faculty will be present.
Just think of it as a field trip.
As he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if
to say: "Bring him."
MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James
glacially as we CUT TO:
BLACK
The dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD, a DOOR
opens, and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of
MARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day.
GRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the
photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN-
STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN
JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.
JAMES LEER
Is that really it?
GRADY
That's really it.
JAMES LEER
The one she wore on her wedding day?
GRADY
So I'm told.
James, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide
garments, stands speechless.
GRADY
(cont'd)
Go ahead.
JAMES LEER
Really?
GRADY
Really.
James swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he
reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar,
barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.
JAMES LEER
They're glass. The buttons.
GRADY
Like the lady herself.
GRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a
bit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the
jacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it.
JAMES LEER
She was small. Most people don't know that.
The shoulders are small.
(touching the satin)
It looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time
she wore it. That day. She must've felt so
...happy.
GRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket,
lifts it lightly.
JAMES LEER
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or...
something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
GRADY
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth
about how much he pays for these things.
JAMES LEER
You're really good friends with the
Chancellor, aren't you?
Grady's eyes slide, paranoid, but James' face remains
unchanged, consumed with the jacket.
GRADY
(carefully)
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell,
too.
JAMES LEER
I guess you must be, if you know the
combination to his closet and he doesn't mind
your being here in their bedroom like this.
GRADY
Right.
A DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump. The
CLICK of a woman's HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom
window, where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN
DS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.
GRADY
We, better skedaddle. Close that closet--
James? You ail right?
James is slumped on the Gaskell's white linen bed,
knapsack between his knees, head in hands.
JAMES LEER
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing
that jacket that belonged to her. It just
looks...really lonely. Hanging there. In a
closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
GRADY
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself
tonight.
JAMES LEER
You mean, with your wife leaving you and ail?
(off Grady's look)
Hannah mentioned something about it.
About a
note.
GRADY
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we
should go now.
Without thinking, GRADY flicks out the bedroom light,
leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today.
James just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.
A LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY
as he enters the hail. A few feet away, Poe lies belly to
the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in
Grady's direction.
GRADY
Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . .
GRADY starts to take a step, when.... Poe shoots forward
and sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle.
GRADY
Jesus!
GRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the
ground as he swings his leg up. Poe, countering, rolls his
head in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy heap.
GRADY
Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch!
Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his
head back and forth, back and forth, over and over,
growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his
throat, until there is a sharp...
CRACK! CRACK!
Poe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily
onto Grady's legs. GRADY
turns. James Leer stands in the doorway, posed with the
little pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen.
GRADY looks at James. Then Poe. Then back to James.
GRADY
Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog.
JAMES LEER
I had to. Didn't I?
GRADY
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
JAMES LEER
No! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1
thought --
GRADY
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on
me.
GRADY roils down his sock. Apparently, Poe went through
life with a slight overbite.
JAMES LEER
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see
if someone's breathing.
GRADY
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead
dog when I see one.
James looks miserably at Poe.
JAMES LEER
What are we going to do?
GRADY rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.
GRADY
First you're going to give me that little cap
gun of yours.
GRADY and James stare gloomily out the windshield.
JAMES LEER
Professor Tripp? Can I
ask you a question?
GRADY
Yea, James.
JAMES LEER
What are we going to do with...
James glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange
blue eyes gleaming.
GRADY
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out
how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her
husband's dog.
JAMES LEER
You?
GRADY
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been
assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear
one of her students was the triggerman.
JAMES LEER
Does she want to hear it was one of her
professors?
GRADY
I've got tenure.
On the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium.
WALTER
...really needs no introduction. Walk down the
aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any
hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at
you. You all know the name, you all know the
books, so welcome if you will, the man those of
us who know him simply call.. .Q.
As the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the
auditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an
open space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID
with a GOATEE .who regards him warily.
Q
Good evening.
GRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him,
watching as Q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting
until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory
hush. Finally, he speaks again.
Q
I am a writer.
As the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He
glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a
similar look of bafflement.
Q (cont'd)
As a writer, one thing you learn is that
everyone you encounter has a story. Every
bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an
idea or a. story that would make a "great book"
or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has
an idea. (gestures to the audience)
But, how do you go from there to here? How do
you go from having an idea to having a book?
How do you get across? What is the bridge, the
bridge that allows you to walk on air from the
shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of
accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is
worth the telling, faith that you have the
wherewithal to tell it, faith that the
carefully woven structure you create won't
collapse beneath you...
GRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking
and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far
EXIT. A blink later, she is gone.
Q (cont'd)
...and faith that when you get to the other
side someone will be waiting who gives a damn
about the tale you have to tell.
GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own
HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a
thread forty feet above his head...
Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement:
bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the
auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn,
James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows
away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady.
GRADY blinks, turns to James.
GRADY
I'll be right back.
GRADY bursts through the auditorium doors and into the
lobby. A PAIR. of local BOOKSELLERS, chatting quietly
behind a table arrayed with the BOOKS of attending authors,
glance up as GRADY limps toward the restrooms.
GRADY stumbles down the sloping carper, but the corridor
begins to turn sideways on him and he stops, resting his
cheek against the cool...cool...wall. ..as...ail..-goes....
BLACK FOR A
MOMENT AND THEN....
SARA'S VOICE
Grady? Grady?
GRADY opens his eyes, finds Sara's face swimming above
him. He is lying on his back in the corridor, his corduroy
blazer bundled under his head like a pillow.
SARA
You had another one, didn't you? You have to
see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday
morning. All right?
GRADY
Is the thing-is it over?
SARA
Almost. Wane to sit up?
(as he winces)
What's the matter?
GRADY
Nothing. I think I twisted my--
GRADY looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt.
GRADY
I have to tell you something. Something..
.hard.
Sara's face stiffens, becomes more Chancelloresque.
SARA
Then stand up. I'm too old for all this
roiling around on the floor.
GRADY lets her pull him up, watches her light a
cigarette.
GRADY
Well...
SARA
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
GRADY
No, really, Sara, I don't think you--
SARA
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to
stay with her.
GRADY
I don't think I really have a choice in, that.
Emily left me.
SARA
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to.
..to not have this baby.
GRADY watches her flip her hand up, bring the cigarette
to her lips, and inhale ...then grimace and drop it to the
floor.
GRADY
Not have it.
SARA
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think
there's no way?
GRADY
Well, no, I don't see any way.
(taking her hand)
And I know how hard it is for you to-- to lose
this chance.
SARA
(jerking away)
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do.
And fuck you for "saying. . .
(quietly)
...for saying there's just no way. Because
there could be a way, Grady.
Somewhere deep in the building, APPLAUSE swells.
SARA
(composing herself)
He must be finishing. We should go.
GRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his
coat.
As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol CLATTERS
to the floor.
SARA
Who's gun is that?
GRADY
It's-it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Before GRADY can close his hand, Sara has it in her own.
SARA
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
GRADY
Caps.
She points it-at Grady's chest. He smiles nervously.
SARA
Pow.
GRADY
You got me.
SARA
I love you, Grady.
GRADY places his fingers gently over Sara's... and
removes the gun from her hand.
GRADY
I love you, too.
The auditorium doors swing open and James Leer emerges,
arms draped over CRABTREE and a LARGE STUDENT.
JAMES LEER
Woah! The doors made so much noise!
As they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear.
JAMES LEER
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry
me out.
GRADY
Is he ail right?
CRABTREE
(rolling his eyes)
He's fine. He's narrating.
JAMES LEER
We're going to the men's room. Only we might
not make it in time.
SARA
Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you
to make that mistake, wait here.
As Sara heads off after James, GRADY turns toward the
lobby...directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak.
MISS SLOVIAK
I need a ride.
GRADY
I'm your man.
GRADY'S CAR - MOVING
As GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top
button of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered
COSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the
glovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAIL
POLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS.
MISS SLOVIAK
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the
poor thing?
GRADY
James is. ..I don't know...
MISS SLOVIAK
Disturbed. And when your friend CRABTREE gets
done with him, he's going to be even more
disturbed.
GRADY
I'm not sure that's possible.
MISS SLOVIAK
Sure it is.
GRADY watches MISS SLOVIAK peel the wig from her
forehead.
GRADY
Listen, Antonia--
MISS SLOVIAK
Tony. Now that I'm home.
GRADY
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so
well for you tonight. With Terry.
MISS SLOVIAK
Forget it. I should've known better. Your
friend is just, I don't know, into collecting
weird tricks. Mind?
Tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself.
GRADY
He's writing his name in water.
MISS SLOVIAK
What's that?
GRADY
Like most editors, he really wants to be a
writer, but he's too busy living a novel to
bother writing one.
MISS SLOVIAK
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a
shit.
GRADY
He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the
feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks.
MISS SLOVIAK
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
GRADY
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
MISS SLOVIAK
He said he hasn't had a success in ten years
and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of
.a. . .
As Tony re-sets the rearview mirror, GRADY gets a glimpse
of his own swollen eyes.
MISS SLOVIAK
...loser. But I'm sure your book is so good
that he'll be able to keep his job.
Hearing this, GRADY looks troubled. MISS SLOVIAK points.
MISS SLOVIAK
(cont'd)
Turn here.
Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY
enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club. She beckons
with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her
glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated
shrug and she points.
CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table. James
slouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the
general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneath
the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap.
Grady, looking a little alarmed, grabs a passing
WAITRESS.
GRADY
Double Dickel on the rocks.
As GRADY arrives, CRABTREE withdraws his hand delicately
and James' eyes flutter open .briefly, ..then close.
GRADY
Is that just beer?
CRABTREE
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a
little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia. You
missed a few bottles, by the way.
GRADY
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
CRABTREE
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to
go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
GRADY cuts James a glance, trying to determine if he's
copped on Poe, but James is winking out. His head drifts
back against the wail, settles with a gentle ...thunk.
GRADY
Jesus. He's out.
CRABTREE glances over, nods.
CRABTREE
He has a book.
GRADY
I know. He started it Fall semester.
CRABTREE
He finished it Winter Break.
GRADY looks up, unable to disguise his surprise.
He
glances at James' slack face tilted against the wall.
CRABTREE
So. Is he any good?
GRADY
No. Not yet he isn't.
CRABTREE
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
GRADY
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's . one o
my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure
if he's-
CRABTREE
He is. Take my word for it.
GRADY
I think it's more complicated than that.
Besides, he's a little...scattered. He almost
...did something stupid tonight. At least, I
think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual
confusion thrown into the stew right now.
CRABTREE
On the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket.
WAITRESS
(ducking in)
Double Dickel.
GRADY
Thanks.
GRADY notices the waitress's nametag (OOLA) and realizes
she is conspicuously PREGNANT. He watches her disappear
beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where Hannah
Green's slinky form seizes his attention.
CRABTREE
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
GRADY
Shut up and drink.
CRABTREE grins, brings his bottle up, then stops.
CRABTREE
Oh my goodness. Do you see what I see?
GRADY follows Crabtree's glance and finds Oola again, but
it's not Oola CRABTREE
is eyeing, it's her CUSTOMER.
GRADY
President of the James Brown Hair Club For
Men.
Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with
big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most
noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.
GRADY
(initiating an old game)
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
CRABTREE
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis..
.Curtis Hardapple.
GRADY
Not Curtis.
CRABTREE
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are
from a--from a horse. He fell during a race and
got trampled.
GRADY
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
CRABTREE
He can't piss standing up anymore.
GRADY
He lives with his mother.
CRABTREE
And he had a younger brother who . . .was . .
. a. . .
GRADY
Groom. Named Claudell.
And his mother blames
Vernon for his death.
CRABTREE
(stumped)
Because. . .because. . .
JAMES LEER
(sleepily)
.. .he was killed, when a gangster named
Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite
horse. He took the bullet himself.
GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens
one bloodshot eye to regard them.
JAMES LEER
Vernon, over there, was in on the hit.
James' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady.
CRABTREE
That was good.
GRADY
He heard everything we were saying.
Just then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots.
HANNAH GREEN
Come on. Teach. I want you to dance with me.
30
GRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the
jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a
sexy, measured blues.
HANNAH GREEN
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's
so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like ail
your sentences always existed, just waiting
around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to
fetch them down.
GRADY
I thank you.
HANNAH GREEN
And I love the inscription you wrote to me.
Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think
I am.
GRADY
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy
innocents we can get.
GRADY spies the corner table, watches CRABTREE say
something to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair
from James Leer's forehead.
HANNAH GREEN
So what are you going to do?
GRADY
Do?
HANNAH GREEN
I just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to
be there when you get home.
GRADY looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then
catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. The
tile that would reflect his head is missing.
GRADY
Are you holding me up or am I dragging you
down?
Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest.
HANNAH GREEN
Shush.
GRADY slides in next to Q, puts the car in gear, and
starts to pull away. As he glances in the rearview, he sees
CRABTREE smiling darkly in the backseat.
GRADY
All right, what's the matter?
CRABTREE just keeps smiling.
GRADY
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do?
The kid's practically in a coma.
CRABTREE
Tripp.
GRADY
Yes.
CRABTREE
Hit your brakes.
GRADY flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a
SHADOW looms in his headlights. As he squashes the break
pedal, Q's EYEGLASSES go flying into the windshield.
Q
(squinting)
Oh my God! What is that?
It's Vernon, waving his arms, his shadow enormous in the
beams of light.
GRADY
What's this guy's problem?
CRABTREE
Just go around him.
GRADY taps the accelerator, but each time, Vernon dances
back in front of Grady's grille.
GRADY
Shit.
CRABTREE
Back up. Go out the other way.
GRADY throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then
turns up a one-way street. He shoots down the alley behind
the Hi-Hat, turns onto the adjoining street, ..and watches
in amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high
wooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie.
As GRADY pinches the brakes, Vernon grins.
GRADY
Now what?
Q
(mischievously)
You could always go over him.
Then, as the three men watch, Vernon rocks back on his
heels and--with a gymnast's precision-pitches himself onto
the Galaxie's big hood. He -lands on his ass, slides
smoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the
night.
Q
What just happened?
GRADY peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood.
GRADY
I just had my car jumped on.
The JANITOR, the same shaggy-haired kid GRADY saw rigging
the WordFest banner earlier, is struggling with a balky
FLOOR WAXER as GRADY steps up to the double doors and slaps
his hand against the glass.
JANITOR
It's open.
GRADY pushes on the door and it opens.
JANITOR (cont'd)
Hey, Professor Tripp.
(off Grady's look)
Traxler. Sam. I took your class freshman year.
Then I dropped out of school.
GRADY
I hope it wasn't my fault.
TRAXLER
(taking him seriously)
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
GRADY
Oh.. .yeah.
The knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding
chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail.
TRAXLER
I saw the manuscript inside. So when you
showed up, I figured. . .
GRADY lifts the knapsack, peers inside. There is no title
page to the MANUSCRIPT, Just the words The Love Parade and
Traxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the
original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving. The
backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR.
TRAXLER
Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff true
about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on
his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last
longer?
GRADY
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
TRAXLER
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography,
aren't you?
Sam points and GRADY glances at the knapsack riding on
the seat between him and Sam. A BOOK'-bearing ERROL FLYNN'S
PICTURE--IS tucked into the side pouch.
GRADY
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub
ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground
lamb.
TRAXLER
Sick.
GRADY enters, closes the door quietly behind him.
The room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes
of light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he
finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T-
shirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling
hand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet
Coke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but
his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He
steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his
disappointment--only the red cowboy boots.
He picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits.
James Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old
sleeping bag. GRADY drops behind his desk, lets James'
knapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects
his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack.
Something yellow. Something soft.
GRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing
a magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET
from James Leer's ratty green knapsack.
GRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking
very tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out the
light on the both of them.
As CRABTREE SNORES thunderously, GRADY eases open the
door, spots the CAR KEYS on the dresser, grabs them.
GRADY eases the door shut, starts to turn, then stops,
his eyes drawn to the door just across the landing from
Crabtree's room.
GRADY pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers,
lets it glide open. The room that is revealed is bright and
well-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of
Grady's office. There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER,
pads and pens neatly arranged alongside.
A BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate
mosaic of multi-colored index cards. There are PRINTS,
framed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's
DHSTJACKETS--including, most prominently, Arsonist's
Daughter.
There are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too. In a black turtleneck
with friends. In a sundress with Grady. In a billowing
Burberry, floating like a dark butterfly against a BLUR of
YELLOW TAXIS on a street in Manhattan.
Smiling brilliantly. Beautiful.
GRADY enters with a THERMOS--pauses--redistributes the
sleeping bag over James Leer's pale body.
JAMES LEER
(without waking)
Thank you.
GRADY
You're welcome.
GRADY sits at his desk, pours himself a cup of coffee
from the thermos, then sets the cup directly in the center
of a galaxy of previous coffee rings. Next, he takes a
clean piece of paper, balls it up, and-with ritual
precision-strokes it into the MINIATURE BASKETBALL HOOP
that crowns the rim of the WASTE BASKET across the room.
All net.
A 9-VOLT CROWD ROAR belches from the hoop and, without
further ceremony, GRADY
turns to the blank page curling from his IBM SELECTRIC
and SPACES to the top right corner, TYPES:
(beat) 2611
In other words: Page 2611.
CLOSE UP - THE TYPEWRITER PAPER -- darkening with WORDS,
the KEYS SNAPPING faster and faster, a CRAZY CLAMOR that
grows and grows until, finally, it just ....Stops.
GRADY
James I
GRADY awakes with his back to the floor, James leer's
quizzical face floating like a cloud above him.
GRADY
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
JAMES LEER
I put you on the floor.
GRADY
Oh.
JAMES LEER
I thought you might--l don't know-- swallow
your tongue or something.
(nodding to Grady's robe)
I guess you really miss her, huh?
GRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets
of the robe, its overall fuzziness.
GRADY
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write
in it.
JAMES LEER
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
GRADY
There is, but it's not that interesting.
James nods. Down the hallway, in another room, the
TELEPHONE RINGS.
JAMES LEER
Want me to get that?
GRADY
Sure.
As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag, GRADY rises
delicately and turns toward the window, ..just in time to
see a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below.
JAMES LEER
(returning)
He didn't give his name.
GRADY
Who?
JAMES LEER
The guy on the phone.
GRADY
What'd he say?
JAMES LEER
He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived here
and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500
with black interior.
GRADY
What'd you tell him?
JAMES LEER
Yes.
GRADY
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be
sure to mention the back door pops open with a
couple hard shakes to the right.
JAMES LEER
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or
something. Is that single-spaced?
James has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on
Grady's desk.
GRADY
Afraid so.
JAMES LEER
That's a big book you're writing.
GRADY
I think it's sort of writing itself at this
point.
JAMES LEER
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working,
but--
GRADY
But . . . ?
JAMES LEER
Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been
awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some
people--some of the kids in workshop--thought
maybe you were...
GRADY
Washed up?
JAMES LEER
Blocked.
GRADY
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
James takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript.
JAMES LEER
No kidding.
A LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch
Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers,
materialize in the hallway.
CRABTREE
Good morning, boys. James.
James waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag.
GRADY
(re: James' "attire")
If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast,
I'd put on something a little less comfortable
if I were you.
As GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the
page curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare
into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE
seems to have made him suddenly queasy.
JAMES LEER
Professor Tripp?
GRADY
Hm.
JAMES LEER
How did I get here last night?
GRADY
No one seems to know where you live, James.
Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
JAMES LEER
And ...and before that. Did I do anything?
Anything bad?
GRADY
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the
English Department's dog and steal his most
prized piece of memorabilia.
As James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY
looks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now
parked at the bottom of his driveway.
GRADY
Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide.
47
James lurks at the top of the stairs, swaddled in the
sleeping bag, straining to hear.
OFFICER PUPCIK (O.S.)
...was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone.
Someone you didn't know. Who seemed out of
place. Suspicious maybe...
GRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a
neighborhood MARKET. GRADY
has a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering
his ragged thumb.
GRADY
Where exactly do you live, James?
James, in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of
ORANGE JUICE, stops.
GRADY
Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as
to the location of your apartment.
GRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic
hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.
JAMES LEER
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked
out. I was asked to leave.
GRADY
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
JAMES LEER
There is, but it's not that interesting.
GRADY
So where have you been staying?
JAMES LEER
(a long pause)
The bus station.
GRADY stares incredulously at James.
JAMES LEER
It's not -so bad. I know the night janitor.
And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
GRADY
(trying to fathom this)
But James. I mean. ..How long?
JAMES LEER
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had
the gun. For protection.
GRADY
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
JAMES LEER
Who?
GRADY
I don't know...
(unconvincingly)
Me.
GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and,
abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling
on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is
staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST
PAPERBACK. GRADY
frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a
spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.
A thought evolves.
GRADY (cont'd)
(the balloons)
What do you think of these?
James takes another chug from his jug, nods.
JAMES LEER
Nice.
GRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches
something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James
glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the
glovebox, then peers at the house.
JAMES LEER
(the house)
Isn't this...?
GRADY
Hm.
GRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange
juice jug between James legs. It's about half-down.
GRADY
You better ease off that stuff, James. It's
pretty acidic.
James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat,
studies it curiously.
JAMES LEER
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the
matter with me.
GRADY
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you
think's the matter with you?
As GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers
the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets
the donut in precisely the same place.
Through the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the
balloon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the
balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement.
SARA O.S.)
Feeling guilty?
GRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized
behind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands.
SARA (cont'd)
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
GRADY
Totally.
I'm sorry. A lot was happening this
morning. Can you talk?
Sara nods, moves the ficus to another table.
SARA
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for
WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole
Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing,
too.
GRADY
I-heard.
SARA
You heard? How?
GRADY
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house
this morning.
SARA
Did you confess?
GRADY looks up, mildly alarmed.
SARA
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
GRADY
Really? That was fast.
SARA
(frowning)
I'm kidding. Hello?
GRADY
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There
is something I need to tell...
SARA
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
GRADY
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to .
. .
SARA
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall
somewhere?
GRADY
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I
don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell
you something.
SARA
All right.
Sara settles back, folds her arms. Waiting.
GRADY
I...
As GRADY stares into Sara's eyes, things begin to blur.
GRADY (cont'd)
...want to be with you.
Sara looks at him.
SARA
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.
I
don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
GRADY
Really, Sara, I...
Sara holds up one gloved hand.
SARA
I believe you. I believe you want to be with
me. But this is not just about me anymore.
GRADY
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
SARA
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I
haven't decided yet.
GRADY
About the baby.
SARA
That ...and you.
GRADY goes still, watches Sara strip off the gloves, drop
them on
a table.
SARA
I'm not going to draw the map for you on this
one, Grady. Times like these you have to do
your own navigating.
Sara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the
street.
SARA
Who's that sitting in your car?
GRADY
James Leer.
SARA
What's he doing out there?
GRADY
I'm sort of helping him work through some
issues.
Sara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door.
SARA
Isn't he lucky.
GRADY watches her ripple across the glass, head for the
house, and wave. James, slumped low in the Galaxie, offers
a limp hand in return, but it's too late.
She's already gone.
GRADY cradles the wheel in his bandaged paw, while James
sits stiffly, the orange juice jug bobbing between his
thighs.
JAMES LEER
She seemed to take it pretty well.
GRADY
Yeah, well, actually. . .
James looks over.
GRADY (cont'd)
The moment didn't really present itself.
James nods, unsurprised, then turns back to the window,
staring at the landscape, still sitting oddly still. GRADY
glances at him. At the orange juice jug.
GRADY (cont'd)
You' re not planning on puking in my car, are
you, James?
Nothing.
GRADY
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley
Heights. We could find you a nice golf course
to barf on.
JAMES LEER
(sharply)
No.
GRADY looks over, surprised by the James' tone. James
blinks, looks embarrassed.
JAMES LEER (cont'd)
I mean. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just...
James peers out the window at passing landscape.
JAMES LEER (cont'd)
I've got a thing about, ..places like this. I
know what those houses are like. I know what
the people are like.
GRADY
Your aunt ?
James turns, eyes flashing with surprise.
GRADY (cont'd)
Hannah mentioned something about an aunt.
James nods vaguely, then reaches into the ashtray, takes
a JOINT between his fingers, sniffs it.
JAMES LEER
Humboldt County?
GRADY
(surprised)
Maybe...
JAMES LEER
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
GRADY
Glaucoma?
JAMES LEER
Colon cancer.
GRADY
Jesus, James. Wow.
James puts the joint back in the ashtray.
JAMES' LEER
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a
small town.
GRADY
Where's that?
JAMES LEER
Carvel.
GRADY
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
JAMES LEER
Outside Scranton.
GRADY
I never heard of it.
JAMES LEER
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin
factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five
years.
GRADY
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
JAMES LEER
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn.
She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before
that, she'd been a dancer.
GRADY
What kind of dancer? .
JAMES LEER
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
GRADY
(in disbelief)
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was
a stripper?
JAMES LEER
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle.
And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's
clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a
bad debt.
GRADY
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic
school?
JAMES LEER
When we fall, we fall hard.
GRADY
Amazing.
GRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then
notices-with surprise--James has his hand out.
GRADY (cont'd)
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to
lose control of his emotions.
JAMES LEER
Maybe I just needed the moment to present
itself.
GRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against
the glass of the living room window, squints inside.
Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the
hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's
sitting in the indentation.
JAMES LEER
Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..-
GRADY
How can you tell?
JAMES LEER
You can see the outline of a butt.
As GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box.
JAMES LEER (cont'd)
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
GRADY
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you
can start on the box.
GRADY leads James through the house. Everything about it
speaks of family. Even the furniture seems arranged so that
people will gather together, light a fire, talk.
JAMES LEER
It feels really... good. ..here.
GRADY
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in
on Christmas morning.
(moving off)
Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
Grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a
DUFFEL BAG open on the floor, its contents a tangle of
quickly-packed clothes. Everything else in the room feels
of another time. PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting a
PRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown.
One photograph lies face down. GRADY turns it over and
finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman,
standing in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on their
wedding day.
James enters, FRENCH ROLL in hand, and sees a REMOTE
CONTROL atop the BAR. Taking it, he points it at the WIDE-
SCREEN TELEVISION imbedded in the opposite wall and,
seconds later, GEORGE SANDERS walks into his CLOSE-UP.
GEORGE SANDERS
There's no such thing as a good influence, Mr.
Gray. All influence is immoral...
Grady, a PINK PRINCESS PHONE to his ear, lies on the bed
next to a huge TEDDY BEAR.
GRADY
(into phone)
Yes, I' m looking for the Chancellor... I
don't know. She should be in the main hall
...Thank you.
James runs through the channels, pauses on MARTIN MILNER
and GEORGE MAHARIS, riding in their curvy Corvette.
A Nelson Riddle's THEME FROM ROUTE 66 BOOMS from below,
GRADY
cups a hand over his ear.
GRADY
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
SARA'S VOICE
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
GRADY
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some
things we need to talk about...
SARA'S VOICE
(evenly)
You're in Kinship?
GRADY
Yes. But that's not why I called...
SARA'S VOICE
With Emily?
GRADY
What? No'. There's no one here. I'm just
...just....
SARA'S VOICE
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
As GRADY endeavors to respond, TWO YOUTHFUL VOICES,
CHEERFULLY SINGING, rise from below.
CHEERFUL VOICES
Good Morning! Good Morning!
GRADY
(yelling)
James! For Christ sake, will you turn that
thing down!
SARA'S VOICE
James? He's still with you?
James, in the midst of pouring himself a tumbler of
Bushmills, smiles as JUDY GARLAND and MICKEY ROONEY sing
their hearts out in Babes In Arms.
JUDY/MICKEY
We talked the whole night through!
GRADY shakes his head, carries the phone toward the
bedroom WINDOW.
GRADY
Look, Sara. ..I'm not here. ..I'm not here to
. . .
As GRADY watches, a late-model PONTIAC BONNEVIlLE turns
into the driveway below him.
GRADY (cont'd)
...reconcile with Emily.
SARA'S VOICE
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
The Bonneville's trunk pops open, revealing THREE BAGS OF
GROCERIES, and HANK and IRENE WINTERS, both in their 60's,
get out. An enormous NEWFOUNDLAND vaults from the backseat.
Sara, eating phone static this whole time, interprets
Grady's silence her own way.
SARA'S VOICE (cont'd)
Goodbye, Grady.
GRADY
No. Sara, you don't understand...
SARA'S VOICE
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say
something to you, Grady.
GRADY
(dreading it)
Yea?
SARA'S VOICE
How you choose to live your own life is your
business. But you be careful with that boy,
Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
As the line goes dead, GRADY watches Hank and Irene
Winters disappear below him.
69
James--Irish whiskey in one hand, the pride of Humboldt
County in the other--watches with deep absorption as Judy
and Mickey have a heartfelt conversation. Then, sensing
something ...he turns.
Hank and Irene Winters, grocery bags in arm, stand
frozen.
JAMES LEER
Hullo.
FOOTSTEPS are HEARD on the staircase and GRADY hobbies
into view. He tries a smile.
GRADY
Mom. Dad.
Hank Winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of
tape, a bottle of alcohol, and some cotton wool.
HANK
Well, it's infected, I can tell you that. I'm
just going to clean it up a bit. It's up to you
to-find someone who knows what they're doing.
Here. Put your foot up.
GRADY puts his foot up on Hank's lazy-Boy, then notices a
BOOK lying face down on the seat. The AUTHOR on the back
cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look
consequential. To his surprise, GRADY realizes the author
is himself.
HANK
So he's one of your students, this boy?
GRADY glances into the living room, where James and Irene
sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. James
is looking out the window, a curious expression on his
face. GRADY looks out his own window, sees the Newfoundland
sniffing curiously at-the Galaxie's trunk. When he glances
back into the living room, he and James make brief eye
contact, then blink, look away.
GRADY
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed
up.
HANK
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll
be fine.
GRADY tries to read Hank's face---is he messing with
him?--but Hank gives nothing away. GRADY nods to the book.
GRADY
What made you pull out that old thing?
HANK
(shrugging)
I was thinking of you.
GRADY
And?
HANK
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you
know that. It's a young man's book. It got me
remembering how it felt to be young.
GRADY
Maybe I should read it.
HANK
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you
aging prematurely, Grady.
GRADY doesn't have to read Hank's face this time.
GRADY
Where's Emily, Hank?
HANK
I 'don't know if she'd want me
to tell you
that, Grady.
GRADY
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just.
..want to know where I stand.
Hank looks up, incredulous.
HANK
Where you stand?
GRADY
(embarrassed)
l-just want to say I'm sorry.
HANK
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The
neurologist.
GRADY
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
HANK
(frowning)
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley
together.
GRADY
(sheepishly)
Oh. Right. Linda ...I haven't been doing a lot
of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I
have the book to finish and--
HANK
Ah, right. The book.
GRADY starts to continue, then stops, cowed by something
in Hank's tone, something dismissive. Instead, he looks
away, toward the living room, and catches sight of James
again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa.
GRADY
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about ail this. I
didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want
you to know that.
HANK
Why did you come here, Grady?
GRADY gestures vaguely.
GRADY
I -just wanted to see her, I guess-- Emily.
And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let
everyone know that, even though it may be
difficult to comprehend now, this-everything
that's happening-it's not forever. It doesn't
mean "Goodbye."
HANK
Give me a break, Grady.
Hank snaps off the tape, slaps Grady's ankle.
HANK
You're done.
71
GRADY glowers darkly at the road, then puts his hand up
against the HEATING VENT which, apparently, is not putting
out any heat.
JAMES LEER
I'm having a really good time, Professor
Tripp.
GRADY glances over, sees James burrowing into the Ziploc.
GRADY
I'm really happy for you, James. But do me a
favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff's
not for amateurs.
James looks at Ziploc as GRADY fiddles with the heat
LEVER.
JAMES LEER
I just wanted a little sip.
GRADY
(squinting at him)
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James,
exactly what point was it that you turned into
Serpent Boy?
JAMES LEER
Probably about the time you gave me the
codeine pills last night.
GRADY stops with the heater, glances over at James, whose
face bears not the slightest trace of irony.
GRADY
Jesus...
(thinking, then. . . )
Look, James, you appear to possess-like many
an aspiring writer before you, by the way-a
rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which
dreams are made. However, I 'think it's best
if, for the moment at least
(taking the Ziploc)
...we abstain.
JAMES LEER
You're mad at me, aren't you?
GRADY
What?
JAMES LEER
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's
dog.
GRADY
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's--
(stopping)
Who said anything about girlfriend?
James eyes shift slowly, as if to 'say: Who are you
kidding?
GRADY
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my
girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't
exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no
reason for him to take two in the chest. Still,
the fact remains that I'm the one who took you
up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one
who has to take the blame. I- don't know what
the hell I was thinking.
JAMES LEER
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap
gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking
'I can't let that kid get on. the bus alone-he
might never get on the bus again.' You were
thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract
this kid. ' So you did. It was--in its way--a
noble act.
GRADY
Thanks for the halo, James, but I've . never
done that much thinking ahead in my" life-ever.
James looks -out the window, pondering this.
JAMES LEER
So, why did you take me up there?
GRADY
(feeling for the heat again)
I -don' t know, James . I don' t know why I do
half the things I do. Who does?
(looking over)
Why do you wear that coat?
James looks down, a little defensive.
JAMES LEER
It's warm.
GRADY
James, fall semester, first day of class, it
was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
James just blinks, no ready answer-available.
GRADY
That's why they all give you such a hard time
in workshop.
JAMES LEER
Because of my coat?
GRADY
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the
time. Not to mention the fact that every last
one of them is jealous of you.
JAMES LEER
(smirking)
Jealous? Of me?
GRADY
Not you. Your talent.
James' face hardens. He looks away.
JAMES LEER
You're lying.
GRADY
The hell I am.
JAMES LEER
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You
said so yourself.
GRADY
I never said that.
JAMES LEER
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend
Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you
said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
GRADY
I didn't mean it that way.
JAMES LEER
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard,
the others--they 're right. My stories are
annoying. They go on and on and on, and the
longer they go on the more annoying they
become, until finally you just want to grab
something heavy and--
GRADY
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and
Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking
about, okay? The entire class combined-
including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one
tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
James stares blankly at Grady, then turns his face to the
window. He ponders Grady's words, the praise inherent in
them. A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.
JAMES LEER
But, last night...
GRADY
Who cares what-. I said last night, James I I
was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a
dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me
some slack?
JAMES LEER
(quietly)
I'm sorry.
GRADY
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares
what anybody thinks anyway? You want to .be a
good writer? You want to be-a great writer?
Then stop giving a damn what other people
think. Most of them haven't thought in .years.
James turns, studies Grady's face as it flickers in the
first headlights of the evening.
GRADY
Let me spell it .out for you, James. Books
don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not
anymore.
JAMES LEER
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
GRADY smiles contemptuously.
JAMES LEER
I mean it. It means something to me. It's one
of the reasons I came to school here. To be in
your class. To be taught by you.
(quietly)
It's one of the reasons I wanted to become a
writer.
GRADY stares ahead, watching the darkness tumble away
before the wide sweep of the Galaxie's headlights.
GRADY
Well, for that, if nothing else, James, I'm
sorry.
GRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he
speaks.
GRADY
C-a-r-v-e-I. That's right, Carvel. Yes, I'm
sure. It's outside Scranton.
GRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by
himself on the far side of the coffee shop.
GRADY
You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at
this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a
resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd
be pretty interested to learn that the good
people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his
entire hometown. It's not like I'm making this
up as I go along--
GRADY stops, his own words ringing in his head.
GRADY (cont'd)
Never mind. My mistake.
The remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as
he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE
PIE. GRADY sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars
that whip by on the highway beyond the window.
JAMES LEER
Want a bite?
GRADY
No thanks.
JAMES LEER
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
GRADY
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like
we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't
have spells.
JAMES LEER
What would you call them then?
GRADY
I don't know. ...'Episodes.'
James shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie.
JAMES LEER
It's because you don't eat.
GRADY
I eat.
JAMES LEER
When?
GRADY
When nobody's looking.
GRADY watches a pair of headlights approach...
JAMES LEER
(mouth full, garbled)
I just worry about you, that's all.
...then pass. James' words finally register. GRADY looks
at him.
GRADY
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
JAMES LEER
Okay.
Just then, a long, pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against
the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking
lot. GRADY follows it with his eyes, rises.
JAMES LEER (cont'd)
Where you going?
GRADY
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
GRADY moves off, then stops, looking back at James and
his giant piece of pie, still troubled by his words.
James is glowering at the parking lot as GRADY returns.
JAMES LEER
I'm not going with them..
GRADY
James. Listen. Things-things are a little
weird with me right now and I-- well--I have
enough blame to shoulder these days without
having to take the blame if something bad
happened to you. And if you hang around me long
enough, something bad is going to happen, trust
me. That's why I need you to go home.
Understand?
JAMES LEER
I'm not going, with them.
GRADY
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
JAMES LEER
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my
grandparents. My parents are dead.
GRADY stares at-James wearily.
JAMES LEER
I swear. My father had his own airplane he
used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and
my mom were flying up to our house in the
Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in
the newspaper.
GRADY doesn't flinch, unpersuaded.
JAMES LEER
I 'swear. My father was a senior vice
president at Dravo. My mother was a socialite.
Her maiden name was Guggenheim.
GRADY starts to protest, then pauses.
GRADY
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
JAMES LEER
Six. Their plane went down right outside
Scranton.
GRADY
(sardonically)
Near Carvel?
JAMES LEER
I'm sorry about all that. I just-I don't like
to talk about my family. They treat me like a
freak.
(nodding towards Amanda)
She makes me sleep in. the basement of my own house. It's
mine. My parents left it to me.
GRADY glances toward the parking lot, studies the
contours of Fred Leer's face. Frowns.
GRADY
James, come on. That man is obviously your
father. You look just like him.
James looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and
speaks in a voice heavy with implication.
JAMES LEER
There's a reason for that.
Grady's addled brain grapples with this dark little
riddle, finally deciphers what James is suggesting.
GRADY
Get out of here.
JAMES LEER
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes
me sleep in the basement.
GRADY
In the crawl space, with the rats and the
casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
As GRADY lifts him from the booth, James attempts a
plaintive tone, but his heart's not in it.
JAMES LEER
I swear.
Times Square before the ball drops. GRADY enters, scans
the room, then shoulders his way to the stairs.
Hannah Green sits on the sofa, twisting a long strand of
hair around her finger as she reads a THICK MANUSCRIPT.
GRADY
(entering)
Hey.
HANNAH GREEN
Grady!
She slaps the page she is reading back onto the stack at
her thigh. GRADY
stares. The manuscript. It's his.
HANNAH GREEN
(embarrassed)
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was,
just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist
and-and--I suck.
GRADY
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it
out in the open like that. CRABTREE hasn't been
in here, has he? Poking around?
HANNAH GREEN
I don't know--maybe- I don't think so.
Grady's
mind races with unfortunate possibilities, but
only briefly: his immediate thoughts are elsewhere.
GRADY
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that
aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
HANNAH GREEN
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The
blind one.
GRADY
Actually, He's not the Chancellor' s--What?
HANNAH GREEN
At first the police thought he just ran away,
but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood
spots on the carpet -
GRADY
Jesus.
HANNAH GREEN
CRABTREE said it sounded like something James
would be messed up in.
GRADY
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
HANNAH GREEN
Who does?
Just then, Crabtree's VOICE bellows in the hallway
outside.
CRABTREE (O.S.)
Trip?! Where are you'
GRADY looks anxiously toward the door.
GRADY
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James
that day?
HANNAH GREEN
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
GRADY
But where? I need the street.
HANNAH GREEN
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a
corner.
CRABTREE (O.S.)
Trip?!
GRADY
Shit.
As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah hooks her finger
inside his belt buckle.
HANNAH GREEN
No! Don't go. I've been waiting ail night for
you.
GRADY looks at Hannah's hand, where it rests. He looks
terrified.
GRADY
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but
right now I--
CRABTREE
(bursting in)
Tripp, where the hell. . .
CRABTREE stops, takes in the tableau before him.
CRABTREE (cont'd)
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting a. student-
teacher conference?
GRADY delicately removes Hannah's hand from his buckle,
points at Crabtree.
GRADY
You stay there.
CRABTREE
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
CRABTREE cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked
on Grady's desk.
CRABTREE
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would
sneak in here and read your book without asking
you?
GRADY
Gee, I don't know. Crabs. I don't seem to
remember you actually asking me if you could
invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
CRABTREE
Sometimes we have to improvise.
GRADY
(ignoring him)
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I
mean, besides you and. ..me?
CRABTREE
James? My James? What's happened?
GRADY
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't
know.. .kidnapped.
CRABTREE
Kidnapped? By who?
GRADY
His parents.
CRABTREE
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
GRADY
Good idea. Crabs. Only one problem. I don't
know where they live.
CRABTREE
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know
where he lives.
GRADY
It's a little late to call Admissions.
CRABTREE
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
GRADY
Maybe ...I don't know.
HANNAH GREEN
Two-sixty-two Baxter Drive.
GRADY and CRABTREE turn, see Hannah sitting on the corner
of Grady's desk with the WHITE PAGES open on her lap.
HANNAH GREEN (cont'd)
They're in the book.
CRABTREE snaps James' manuscript closed.
CRABTREE
You know--based on what I've read-- this is a
very exciting piece of material, this Big
Parade.
GRADY
Love. It's Love facade--and what do you mean
'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two
chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling
methamphetamines.
CRABTREE
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I
feel this kid in my bones.
GRADY
Only in your bones?
GRADY smirks, glances at Crabtree, but gets a surprise;
CRABTREE offers no snappy come-back, no antic wordplay. He
just stares out the window, his voice distant.
CRABTREE
No. I think I might be right. I've felt it
before...
As Crabtree's voice trails off, GRADY studies him.
GRADY
How bad is it for you?
CRABTREE
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit
the new corporate profile.
GRADY
Which is?
CRABTREE
Competence.
GRADY and CRABTREE look at each other a moment, then
CRABTREE smiles, gives a little shrug, and picks up James'
knapsack, rummaging through the contents.
CRABTREE (cont'd)
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
GRADY
What's to tell?
CRABTREE
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
CRABTREE fishes out the biography of Erroll Flynn, gives
it a look.
CRABTREE
...I like her.
GRADY peers at the stars, his voice barely audible.
GRADY
Me too.
87
Electric CANDELABRAS light a large converted cellar whose
walls are crowded with MOVIE POSTERS and LOBBY CARDS. There
are STACKS of what look suspiciously like LIBRARY BOOKS and
an enormous BAROQUE BED, complete with CANOPY.
CRABTREE
I like what you've done with it. When's
Captain Nemo moving in?
JAMES LEER
The candelabras were my Gran's.
GRADY
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll
leave you here.
CRABTREE
Hey, I heard all about it--the parents, the
grandparents, the China town thing-- and I
believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now
go get dressed.
James scoops up the shirt GRADY lent him. this morning.
JAMES LEER
Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this
again. Professor Tripp?
GRADY
Ah, wear whatever you want.
James flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom.
CRABTREE
So modest.
GRADY
So sensitive.
CRABTREE
(nosing around the room)
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
GRADY
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just
once I'd like to know if the little bastard is
telling the truth.
CRABTREE
The-truth. I know that's always been real
important to you. Key, check this out...
CRABTREE leans over an old ROYAL TYPEWRITER, reads from
the freshly-typed PAGE curling from the carriage.
CRABTREE
Finally, the door opened. It-was a shock to:
see him, shuffling into the room like an aging
prizefighter. Limping. Beaten.'
(with an amused smile)
Sound like anyone we know?
(resuming)
But it was later, when the great man squinted
into the bitter glow or twilight...
(frowning)
Bitter glow of twilight? This kid definitely
needs an editor.
(resuming)
...and muttered simply, "It means nothing. All of it.
Nothing," that the true shock came. It was then that the
boy understood that his hero's true injuries lay hidden in
a darker place. His heart...'
CRABTREE stops abruptly.
GRADY
Yes? 'His heart...'
CRABTREE hesitates, then... reads on:
CRABTREE
'His heart, once capable of inspiring others
so completely, could no longer inspire so much
as itself. It beat now only out of habit. It
beat now only because it could. '
GRADY nods, his face unreadable, then James returns.
JAMES LEER
I'm ready...
James stops, sees the two men looking at him.
JAMES LEER
You all right, Professor Tripp?
CRABTREE
He's great. Come on, let's blow before ol'
Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
JAMES LEER
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming
down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of,
check on me. If I'm not here, she might ...call
the police or.. .something.
CRABTREE
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows
and one of your teddy bears under the spread
and she won't know the difference.
JAMES LEER
(brightening)
Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use
a couple big hams.
GRADY
No.
CRABTREE and James turn.
GRADY
I've got something better than a teddy bear.
CUT TO: POE -- as he's lowered delicately onto James'
bed.
GRADY strategically arranges the coverlet, gently
adjusting Poe's head so only a TUFT of FUR shows. He steps
back, joining CRABTREE and James for an assessment.
GRADY
Sweet dreams, Jimmy.
A quiet disaster, the only sound an LP playing meekly on
the STEREO. James passes through first, ignoring the
TORTILLA CHIPS POPPING under his shoes, then CRABTREE and
GRADY appear.
CRABTREE
Things must've picked up after we left.
CRABTREE pats Grady's cheek, heads upstairs.
Crabtree's door is closing as GRADY hobbles into view.
GRADY
Crabtree.
CRABTREE
(sticking his head out)
Ye-es?
GRADY looks down, sees James Leer's black brogues sitting
on the floor outside Crabtree's door.
GRADY
Nothing.
The door closes, the LATCH CLICKS, and GRADY is left
alone, the bossa nova floating softly in the air.
Hannah Green lies tangled in the sheets, surrounded by
little colonies of Grady's manuscript. GRADY studies her,
then detects something on the floor. The red boots.
Delicately, he lifts the sheet. Hannah Green's feet--
finally revealed in ail their naked glory--prove to be
thick, wide, and ordinary. GRADY
sighs.
The TV is on. GRADY steps to the doorway, pauses.
VOICE
Hey.
A HEAD cranes over the sofa. It's the Goatee Kid from
Thaw Hail.
GRADY
How are you--is it Joe?
GOATEE KID
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your
house until about an hour ago.
GRADY
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
GOATEE KID
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester,
what I said that time in office hours-I hope
there's no hard feelings.
GRADY
No...
GOATEE KID
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at
the time and my car was ail fucked up and--
well--I was pretty bent in general.
GRADY
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
GOATEE KID
I just want you to know that's why I dropped
your class and said all that shit about the
university stealing my money and you being a
pseudo-Faulknerian nobody.
A heavy THHNK hits the driveway outside and GRADY blinks.
Sitting in his pink robe, bleary-eyed, he reconsiders the
piece of paper curling from his typewriter.
GRADY'S POV - of THE PAGE
It's obvious he's been sitting like this for some time.
Just then, the DISTINCTIVE PURR of an ENGINE is HEARD.
GRADY peers through the window, watches a CAB. glide to the
curb below. A Citroen DS23. Sara.
CRABTREE sits in bed, flipping through the pages of The
Love Parade while stroking a tiny TUFT of HAIR that is the
. sole visible part of .James Leer.
GRADY
(swinging in)
Is he awake?
CRABTREE
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
GRADY
Nevertheless. There's a police officer
standing on the porch and I don't think he's
going away.
JAMES LEER
(from under the covers)
That same guy?
CRABTREE peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one
eye.
JAMES LEER
You snore.
CRABTREE
So I hear.
JAMES LEER
(studying Grady)
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look
sorta crappy.
CRABTREE
He's right, you look horrible.
GRADY
Thank you, Frankie and Annette.
James swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks
bare assed across the room to retrieve his BVDs.
JAMES LEER
It's the Chancellor.
CRABTREE
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
GRADY
And we both thank you for that, but we're...
we're... fine.
JAMES LEER
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
GRADY squints at James as he pulls on his pants.
GRADY
Shut up, James.
CRABTREE
So what's the problem?
GRADY
(a tad tense)
There is no problem. Did I say there was a
problem?
As James' head pops through Grady's fully-buttoned
flannel, he and CRABTREE
exchange a knowing glance, at once referring to and
excluding Grady.
SARA (0. S.)
How's it coming back there, Professor Tripp?
CRABTREE
Who's that?
GRADY
Who do you think it is?
CRABTREE
The Chancellor's here? Now?
GRADY
Evidently.
(calling)
Coming!
JAMES LEER
Does she mean--does she know about ...her dog?
GRADY
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does. Know. But
let's spare her the details. Come on, your
shoes are in the hail.
CRABTREE
James. This book of yours. It's not bad. Not
bad at all.
James stops, considers this piece of news with a look of
deep seriousness, then nods.
JAMES LEER
Thank you.
CRABTREE
You're welcome.
As James shuffles off into the hail, CRABTREE looks at
Grady, his eyes dancing with excitement.
CRABTREE
I want to publish this.
I've got to.
I think
they'll let me.
With a little editorial
guidance it could be brilliant.
GRADY
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out
there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been
awhile since somebody wrote a good book in
jail.
- 100
Hannah, wrapped loosely in cotton sheets, SMILES as she
listens to the Goatee Kid, who sits cross-legged at the
foot of-her bed, fully clothed.
GOATEE KID
I'm telling you, the tango is ail about latent
homosexual love. Look at the way they dance--
it's sodomy.
HANNAH GREEN
(laughing)
Stop it.
Hannah looks up, sees GRADY in the doorway and blushes.
She pulls the sheet up, gives an oddly formal wave.
HANNAH GREEN
Grady. Hi. What's up?
Jeff eases off the bed, past GRADY uneasily.
GOATEE KID
I'll be ...somewhere else.
GRADY
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in
discussing that business with the tango, try
the guy at the end of the hall.
Jeff nods--puzzled--then goes. GRADY smirks.
GRADY
He cribbed that from Borges.
HANNAH GREEN
It beats 'What's your major?'
GRADY nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice.
GRADY
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could
borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of
commission.
HANNAH GREEN
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to.
..to your book.
The hitch in Hannah's voice hangs in the room like a
cloud.
HANNAH GREEN
I uh, I didn't finish, I ...fell asleep.
GRADY
That good, hub?
HANNAH GREEN
No, it's not that, it's...
Hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her
dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to Grady.
HANNAH GREEN
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about
how, in class, you're always telling us '-that
writers make choices--at least the good ones.
And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the
book isn't really great-I mean, really great-
but at times it's, well, very detailed, you
know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses
and ail the dental records and so on-and I
don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of
reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...
(with trepidation)
...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was
wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you
wrote, you weren't always ...under the influence.
GRADY
(stung)
Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as
shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first
writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore,
it might interest you to know that one book I
wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, '
happened to win a little something called the
PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under
the influence. '
Hannah nods, averts her eyes, and immediately GRADY feels
ridiculous. He starts to say something, but instead gathers
his manuscript and exits.
Crabtree, dressed now, studies the freight 'in Grady's
arms as he reaches the bottom of the stairs.
CRABTREE
Want some help with that?
GRADY
(passing by)
Don't touch it.
CRABTREE sucks on a Kool, driving Hannah's rattling
Renault too fast, shifting gears apparently at random.
GRADY rides shotgun, still wearing the robe over his
clothes, the Wonder Boys manuscript sitting like a
watermelon on his lap-looking, all in all, fairly pathetic.
CRABTREE
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes
you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his
car.
GRADY
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't
exactly Jerry's to give.
CRABTREE
So whose car is it?
GRADY
My guess-Vernon Hardapple.
CRABTREE
The hood jumper?
GRADY
He said a few things that lead me to believe
the car's his.
CRABTREE
Such as.
GRADY
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
CRABTREE
Hh hub. So. We find Vernon, we find the car.
We find the car...
GRADY
...we find the jacket.
CRABTREE
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know
his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we
made the whole guy up.
GRADY
No wonder he screwed us over.
CUT TO:
BILL MAZEROSKI legendary Pittsburgh Pirate second
baseman, large as a Macy's Day float, his weathered image
scaling three floors on the BRICK face of a RIVERFRONT
STOREFRONT.
CRABTREE takes a corner recklessly, immediately slows,
and blinks in amazement.
CRABTREE
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
GRADY
Call it a hunch.
Parked in front of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS is the white
van. A few feet behind, the battered Galaxie.
CRABTREE
I'd call it genius.
GRADY steps out, strips off the robe, and drops the lumpy
leviathan that is his manuscript on the front seat.
GRADY
It's good to know I'm still talented at
something. Keep the motor running.
104
GRADY peers into the backseat, squinting against the WIND
that swirls around him. Errol Flynn's face leers back at
him. But no jacket. GRADY slides in, pops the glove box,
and frowns at the ZIPLOC of Humboldt County. He pockets it
anyway, then spies something else.
James Leer's little PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL.
GRADY takes it, rotates it-in his palm. SUNLIGHT GLINTS
off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a
SWEET, SOFT BLUR...
CRABTREE stomps on his Kool. GRADY looks very much like a
man who has pulled off the road to take a nap.
CRABTREE
What the hell...
As GRADY lolls behind the steering wheel, a CLOUD
appears, hovering, then slowly mutates, and GRADY realizes
it's not a cloud at all, it's
MARILYN MONROE standing by the side mirror, wearing a
bright pink dress under her wedding jacket.
MARILYN
I know you. . .
Marilyn's face swims before Grady's eyes, but there's
something wrong with it. This girl's eyes are brown and
besides, she's ...fat.
MARILYN (cont'd)
Double Dickel on the rocks.
The last of the fairy dust evaporates and GRADY finds-
standing before him in a pink jersey dress and Marilyn
Monroe's wedding jacket--0ola, the pregnant waitress from
the Hi-Hat Club.
GRADY
Oola.
OOLA
I never forget a drink.
GRADY
I never forget an Oola.
Suddenly, there is a HEAVY CLICK.
MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
Forget me?
GRADY starts to turn, but his head won't
move: largely
because the BARREL of a GERMAN NINE is pressed to his
temple. Grady's eyes slide.
GRADY
Vernon.
VERNON
(to Oola)
Move away, cupcake.
He's got a gun.
GRADY
Who's got a gun?
VERNON
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
GRADY
Relax, Vernon...
OOLA
Why's he calling you Vernon?
VERNON
Why's he sitting in my car? He's crazy, that's
why. He probably calls everybody Vernon.
GRADY
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know.
Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon
Peabody at Penguin U.K.
VERNON
Shut up.
(to Oola)
Cupcake. Please. Inside.
OOLA
You' re not going to shoot him, are you?
VERNON
I'm going to shoot him. If he doesn't put that
gun down.
GRADY
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the
caps anymore.
VERNON
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And
that's a gun.
GRADY
No, really....
GRADY lifts his arm, points the little pearl-handled
pistol to the DARK CLOUDS overhead.
CRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's
arm FLASHES, makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind.
CRABTREE
Holy shit.
Vernon drives, Oola at his side. In-the back, CRABTREE
puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly
with the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED
PAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print.
CRABTREE
Naturally you have copies.
GRADY
I have an alternate version of the first
chapter.
CRABTREE
You'll be all right then.
Look at Carlyle,
when he lost his luggage.
GRADY
That was MacCaulay.
CRABTREE
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those
stories.
GRADY
He was never able to reproduce them.
CRABTREE
Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to
depreciate the loss here, but perhaps--in a
sense- this--
(nodding to the pages)
is for the best.
Grady's eyes shift, study Crabtree.
GRADY
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
CRABTREE
In a sense.
GRADY
I don't think so. In my experience, signs are
usually a lot more subtle.
VERNON
Let me get this straight. All that paper that
went into the river. That was the only copy?
GRADY
'Fraid so.
VERNON
(glowering at Crabtree)
And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What
the fuck's the matter with you?
CRABTREE
I'm just saying that sometimes,
subconsciously, a person will put themselves in
a situation-perhaps even create that situation-
in order to have an arena in which to work out
an unresolved issue. It's a covert way, if you
will, of addressing a problem.
Vernon stares at CRABTREE as if he's from another planet.
VERNON
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the
wheel. There's your fucking problem.
CRABTREE
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
VERNON
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights
in the middle of the street none of this
happens.
CRABTREE
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun
to his head?
VERNON
He was trying to steal my car!
GRADY
Ail right, all right It's done. There's no
need to talk about it. It's done.
They ride in silence for a moment, then Oola turns,
glances at GRADY
and his little sheaf of pages.
OOLA
So what was it about?
(as GRADY looks up)
Your book.
What was the story?
GRADY stares into Oola's sweet, brown eyes.
GRADY
I don't know...
Oola's brow wrinkles. CRABTREE glances at his old friend,
genuine compassion in his eyes.
CRABTREE
What he means is, it's difficult to distill
the essence of a book sometimes. It-lives in
the mind.
VERNON
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about,
right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was
about, why were you writing it?
GRADY
I couldn't stop.
Dead quiet. Gradually, STEPS are heard, coming from the
stairwell, then GRADY limps into view.
GRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks.
He walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two
afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill
breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the
barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he-.
turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his
pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his
manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half
length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner
down into a triangle along the first crease...
GRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the
auditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies
Sara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER.
GRADY
Sara!
Sara turns ...as the door glides shut. As GRADY hustles
forward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him.
Q
Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look
at Arsonist's Daughter the other night. There's
a description of a bald cypress that left' me
breathless.
GRADY
(pushing past him)
Thanks, Q. I felt the same way about the bank
teller's breasts in your last one.
GRADY enters, but Sara is ...gone. He picks his way
behind the back row, scanning the aisles.
GIRL'S VOICS
Hey, Professor Tripp.
It's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop.
GRADY takes another look around, then drops into the seat-
next to her.
CARRIE MCWHIRTY
If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the
aisle.
GRADY
No...
But GRADY looks anyway. Hannah sits a dozen rows down the
aisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming.
The Goatee Kid sits close beside her.
CARRIE MCWHIRTY
Who's that guy she's with? Didn't he used to
be in workshop?
GRADY
Jeff. He comes from a long line of tango
dancers.
Walter turns over the last page of-his prepared notes.
WALTER
And now, as those of you who've been with us
in previous years know, we have a tradition of
sorts here at WordFest. I'm speaking, of
course, of The Plums.
An anticipatory BUZZ sweeps through the audience as
Walter begins to read from a separate list.
WALTER
This weekend, Susan Lowery, of North Braddock,
found a publisher for her children's book. The
Loneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.
As a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause,
GRADY cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. To his
surprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the
front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily
complacent smile. James is next to him, now wearing
CRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shirt.
WALTER
And Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for
his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has
found a home with Putnam for his new Three
Rivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.
A SHORT, BALDING MAN stands briefly then Walter's VOICE
takes a shift in tone.
WALTER
Now, this next one, I think, is especially
exciting to announce, because it concerns a
student here at the university. Our own James
Leer, a sophomore in English literature, has
found a publisher for his first novel, which I
believe is called The Lovely Parade.
GRADY blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile
warmly toward the front row. CRABTREE gives James a jab in
the ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises. Stunned,
Carrie McWhirty turns to the GIRL next to her.
CARRIE MCWHIRTY
I have a class with him.
James hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail, waiting as the
APPLAUSE slows, then sputters, then dies out altogether.
CARRIE MCWHIRTY
The guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know
what I mean.
Grady, in a last attempt to save James from himself, cups
Hi his hands around his mouth.
GRADY
Take a bow, James!
James turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish
grin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and
takes his first sweet public bow.
GRADY (cont'd)
(softly)
Wonder Boy.
WALTER
And finally--and perhaps not least
importantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has
also decided to publish my own book--a critical
exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and
Joe DiMaggio and its function in American
mythopoetics-which, tentatively, I've entitled
The Last American Marriage.
"
Wild, obsequious APPLAUSE. GRADY smiles cynically,
watches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own.
. :
WALTER
Until next year. Thank you, everyone.
The LIGHTS come up. As the auditorium empties, CRABTREE
shakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah
Green down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms
around James.
GRADY watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when
suddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder. She says
something congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door.
GRADY blinks, scrambles up.
GRADY bursts into the corridor.'
GRADY
Sara!
Its empty. Quiet. GRADY pauses. Somewhere, a HEAVY METAL
DOOR CLOSES. GRADY rushes on.
Grady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a DOOR. He
moves to it, pushes past...
...and finds himself standing in a stairwell. He leans
out over the railing, peers down. It's a steep drop, very.
steep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of
basement office, with VENDING MACHINES, PLASTIC CHAIRS, and
a COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE.
GRADY turns back to the door he came through, pushes
against it. Locked. He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his
ailing ankle, then sits. He fishes out the Ziploc of-
marijuana, considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating
atop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. The
SOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and, hopeful they're
Sara's, GRADY pulls himself up, peers over the railing.
It's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.
GRADY
Yo, Traxler.
TRAXLER
(looking up)
Hey, Professor Tripp.
GRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.
GRADY
Do you get high, Sam?
TRAXLER
Only when I'm working.
GRADY hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc.
It
pinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's
feet.
TRAXLER
Holy shit. Are you serious?
GRADY
As a heart attack.
TRAXLER
Thanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful ^here...
GRADY is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy
now. His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on
a window ledge-and as he starts to drop...
...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON
caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.
SARA
Grady, what are you doing, you idiot?
GRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face.
GRADY
Looking for you.
He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL
GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS...
faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's
name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH
upward until we see that she is...
KISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue.
GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue
plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the
curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips
slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW
fall outside.
The DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then
the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears.
His NAMETAG says GREENHUT.
GRADY
I passed out.
GREENHUT
You did.
GRADY
I've been doing that a lot lately.
GREENHUT
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of
marijuana, I understand.
GRADY
Do you think that's why I've been having
these...
(grabbing James' term)
... spells?
GREENHUT
How long have you been having them?
GRADY
The last month maybe.
GREENHUT
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
GRADY
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
GREENHUT
That's probably not the problem, then. What
about your lifestyle. Any major changes
recently?
GRADY
I've been trying to finish a book...
GREENHUT
And your wife left you.
GRADY
Is that in my chart?
GREENHUT
I spoke with the woman who saved your life.
You're lucky she came along when she did.
GRADY considers the larger ramifications of this
statement
GRADY
I know.
GREENHUT
(tapping the glucose bottle)
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An
internist. And I think you really ought to
consider seeing a therapist, as well.
GRADY
She told you about. . .
GREENHUT
Her dog, yes.
GRADY
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
Greenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the
first time, and GRADY
stops.
GREENHUT
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all
right? On top of that, you have a bite on your
ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you
with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another
day or two and you might have lost the foot. As
for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result
of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
GRADY
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little
disappointing.
GREENHUT
Better luck next time.
GRADY
So is my friend...is Sara still here?
GREENHUT
No. There's no one here.
GRADY
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in
his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch.
GREENHUT
Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave,
I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a
prescription for a course of ampicillin and I
want you to follow it to the end-no matter how
stupid you decide to be with everything else.
All right?
GRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around
him as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that
connects one building to another.
GRADY
I wonder if you could show me something.
