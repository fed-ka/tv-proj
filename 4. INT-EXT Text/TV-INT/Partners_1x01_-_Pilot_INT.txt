                Do you remember my cousin Mindy from 

                  Michigan?  Big, strange body?  I used 

                to say she was half Jewish, half club 

                chair?  Well she friended me last 

                night to say that looks-wise I m a  B-

                minus,  but I act like I m an  A.   

                Can you believe that?  Just out of the

                Maybe she s still bitter about having 

                to choose between being Bat Mitzvahed

                Thank you! (LONG PAUSE, THEN) Wait. 

                Because a  B-minus  is too low? Or

                couple of glasses of wine--

                Not that we don t have issues.  You 

                know how I feel about him being a

                  (BARITONE) Hi Mitch.

                                  MITCH

                It is considered harassment to go onto 

                my computer and change my  Call of 

                Duty 4  screen saver to a picture of a 

                frog fellating an orangutan. 

                                  LOUIS

                How dare you, Mitchell!  I would never 

                do such a thing.

                                    CHARLIE

                Neither would I!  And technically it 

                was a gibbon.        "Kohan/Mutchnick Pilot" Second Rev Network Draft 1/12/12 11.

                Every business on this floor pays the 

                same rent per square foot.  It s a

                your partner think because you re 

                  architects and I m only a CPA that 

                you re better than I am.

                Oh, well that explains it.  You were a

                you re definitely not a  B minus  now.

                it upsetting that you would even ask. 

                (THEN)  Of course I am.  How do you

                For you.  You have to live with such

                My G-d, Louis, even your P.E. teacher 

                was easier on you than that.  It must 

                be so hard for you.

                You re kidding.  Why?  What s better 

                than Ali?

                                  LOUIS

                She wants to get married, so she gave

                Yeah.  (BEAT, THEN)  What is a  play 

                me or trade me ultimatum? 

                                  WYATT

                I have no idea.  I was going along

                Well, if he doesn t think she s the 

                one, then he d be doing both of them a 

                  disservice if he agreed to marry her.          "Kohan/Mutchnick Pilot" Second Rev Network Draft 1/12/12 24.

                Right.  Right.  Thank G-d, we don t 

                have to deal with that.

                You don t have to tell me. 

                                  LOUIS

                (BUT THEN AGAIN)  Why don t we have to 

                deal with that?

                What do you mean? 

                                  LOUIS

                I mean, we can get legally married in

                                  WYATT

                But we don t want to.

                But we don t.

                But what if we did?  What if I were to 

                say,  play me or trade me, Wyatt? 

                                  WYATT

                                  LOUIS

                I don t know.  We were talking about 

                you and Ali, so I hypothetically asked 

                him what he would say if I gave him a 

                marriage ultimatum, and he 

                  hypothetically said he d have to think 

                about it, and I hypothetically said, 

                 What do you mean you d have to think 

                about it?!  and he hypothetically 

                said,  Calm down, Louis,  and I 

                  hypothetically snapped and said 

                horrible things to him and then he not-

                  at-all-hypothetically kicked me out of 

                the apartment!

                phone... I had to sleep on the 

                streets.

                thought to myself,   Louis, you re not 

                going through this alone!  Charlie 

                broke up with Ali, too.  You ll go 

                through this together.  You ll help

                I do.  You get something into your

                before you do something stupid.  And 

                then I have to deal with it.

                Who told you I wanted to be engaged?        "Kohan/Mutchnick Pilot" Second Rev Network Draft 1/12/12 42.


                                    CHARLIE

                You did!

                                  LOUIS

                That was a hypothetical!  I didn t say 

                he should marry me.  I just needed to 

                know that he would marry me.

                (TO LOUIS)  G ahead.  

                                  LOUIS

                You know I don t want to get married.  

                I m the dynamic, complicated one with 

                intimacy issues.  I don t want a 

                husband, just a life partner who tells 

                me I m beautiful even though he s the 

                 A  and I m the  C.   I m Oprah, 

                dammit! 

                                    CHARLIE

                  Apologize!

                                  LOUIS

                For what?        "Kohan/Mutchnick Pilot" Second Rev Network Draft 1/12/12 43.


                                    CHARLIE

                For what you said to my girlfriend.

                                  LOUIS

                What about what you said to my 

                  girlfriend?   

      THEY STARE EACH OTHER DOWN FOR A COUPLE OF BEATS.  IT S VERY 
      TENSE. 

                                  RO-RO

                You know, in Staten Island, this is 

                where someone throws a punch. 

      ON CUE, THEY LUNGE AT EACH OTHER, EACH ONE GETTING THE OTHER 
      INTO A HEADLOCK.  THEY HAVE AN AWKWARD SCRUM AROUND THE 
      OFFICE.    

                                  RO-RO (CONT D)

                Guys, come on, knock it off!

      THEY ROLL ONTO RO-RO S DESK, KNOCKING STUFF TO THE FLOOR.  

                                  RO-RO (CONT D)

                Alright, that s enough.  Break it up.  

      RO-RO STEPS IN AND TRIES TO SEPARATE THEM BUT INSTEAD FINDS 
      HERSELF SWEPT INTO THE FIGHT.  THEY ARE NOW A SIX-LEGGED 
      MONSTER THRASHING AROUND THE ROOM.  MOVING AS ONE, THEY SLAM 
      INTO THE MODEL, SMASHING IT TO PIECES.  RO-RO LEAPS TO HER 
      FEET.  

                                  RO-RO (CONT D)

                You happy now!?  Look what you did!! 

      CHARLIE AND LOUIS STARE AT THE WRECKAGE OF THEIR FIGHT.

                                  RO-RO (CONT D)

                Now what are you going to do?

      LOUIS LOOKS AT CHARLIE.  THEY SOFTEN.

                                  LOUIS

                (TO CHARLIE)  I screwed up... sorry.         "Kohan/Mutchnick Pilot" Second Rev Network Draft 1/12/12 44.


                                    CHARLIE

                I m sorry, too. 

                                  RO-RO

                Okay, that s very touching, ladies, 

                but you still have a mess to deal 

                with.  Now you gotta fix what you 

                broke.

      HER WORDS RESONATE WITH THEM.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER.  
      THEY RE THINKING THE SAME THING.

                                  LOUIS

                She s right.  

                                    CHARLIE

                She s always right.

       THEY GET UP AND START TO EXIT. 

                                  RO-RO

                Where you going?  

                                    CHARLIE

                To fix what we broke.  

      THEY EXIT.  AS WE:

      CHARLIE AND LOUIS HAVE JUST EXPLAINED TO ALI AND WYATT. 

                                    CHARLIE

                ...and I also need to apologize to 

                you, Wyatt.  I shouldn t have been so 

                  presumptuous.  It won t happen again. 

                                  WYATT

                Thank you.

                                  LOUIS

                And Alison...

                                  ALI

                Ali.

                                  LOUIS

                I prefer Alison.

                                  ALI

                I prefer Ali. 

                                  LOUIS

                Ali -- (COUGHS THE WORD,  SON )  I m 

                sorry, too. 

                                  ALI

                For what?

                                  LOUIS

                For telling you... the truth.  It 

                won t happen again.         "Kohan/Mutchnick Pilot" Second Rev Network Draft 1/12/12 46.


                                    CHARLIE

                (TO LOUIS)  Way to own it, buddy. 

                                  ALI

                So now what?

                                    CHARLIE

                Now that you know the whole story, do 

                you believe that I asked you to marry 

                me because it s what I truly want? 

                                  ALI

                I do.

                                    CHARLIE

                Good.  Then I think the most efficient 

                way of handling this situation is if I 

                take this ring off of Louis  finger, 

                and put it back onto your finger.

      HE TAKES THE RING OFF LOUIS  FINGER AND PUTS IT ON ALI S.

                                  LOUIS

                Ucch.  Did everyone catch the creepy 

                  symbolism of that little moment?

                                    CHARLIE

                I m just glad you drew attention to 

                it.

                                  WYATT

                It s not like it s something we don t 

                know.  You two have basically been  

                married for thirty years.         "Kohan/Mutchnick Pilot" Second Rev Network Draft 1/12/12 47.


                                  LOUIS

                Well, we do yell at each other a lot. 

                                    CHARLIE

                And we don t have sex. 

                                  LOUIS

                And we don t bother closing the 

                bathroom door anymore.

                                    CHARLIE

                Sounds like marriage to me...

                                  ALI

                Great.  Can t wait.

                                  WYATT

                There might be four people at this 

                table, but there are three couples. 

                                  ALI

                Which is fine as long as you remember 

                which relationship takes priority.

      Agreed.  Obviously.
