    A NEGOTIATOR, among a heavy perimeter of cop cars--

                                NEGOTIATOR (INTO PHONE)
                I hear you, Hollis, I really do.  He used 
                you.  Took advantage of all your work, and 
                then cut you loose. It s a terrible thing--

  WE HEAR A COMMOTION OVER THE PHONE, before the line goes 
  dead.  Off the Negotiator, concerned--

                                                                              CUT TO:                Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      2.




                                NEGOTIATOR (INTO PHONE)
                Alright, listen; I ve got people to 
                answer to, and if they think those 
                hostages are in imminent danger, they re 
                gonna start kicking in doors.

                                HOLLIS (FROM PHONE)
                You won t. You know I ll blow the office.

                                NEGOTIATOR (INTO PHONE)
                I know that, but at a certain point it 
                isn t gonna be up to me anymore.  Now 
                since I don t think either of us want to 
                go down that road just yet, help me buy 
                some time.  Send out the employees...

                                HOLLIS (FROM PHONE)
                No...  No that won t work...

                                NEGOTIATOR (INTO PHONE)
                Lemme finish.  The deal is, I get the 
                  bystanders, and you keep Ken Lydecker.  
                He s the only one you really want anyway.

                You ll still have leverage, and I ll have 
                  something to show my bosses.  And we all 
                get to live a little while longer...

  ON HOLLIS, sweaty.  He doesn t know what to do.  But he 
  watches the Woman Hostage crying on the floor, and a moment 
  of humanity hits him...  Off Hollis--

                                                                              CUT TO:


  We see a line of HOSTAGES filing out of the building.  The 
  cops receive them, offer medical assistance, etc.

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Among the hostages being attended to, we spot KEN LYDECKER.  
  Bloodied, but safe, free and reunited with his family.

  The Police Negotiator is arguing with his CHIEF, as--

    BOOOM!!!!!  THE THIRD FLOOR EXPLODES, shattering windows...  
  Smoke billows out, as glass and debris rain down on us...

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK:

  THE SOUND OF A DOOR CREAKING OPEN...  And then, FOOTSTEPS...

                        CHYRON:   FOUR WEEKS LATER...

  The footsteps continue as we--

                                                                              FADE IN:


  A private platform, filled with invited guests.  A banner 
  above:  MONTEREY LINE - MAIDEN VOYAGE.  And just off the 
  platform, a sleek, double-decker bullet train.  MONTEREY ONE.  
  Chance walks with Stephanie through the crowd.  Eyes open, 
  never watching her.  Always watching the crowd. 

                                STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                You re Tony Graham, my new translator.

  Stephanie s voice-over matches (but just barely) the movement 
  of her lips as she introduces Chance to her colleagues.

                                CHANCE (V.O.)
                What happened to your old translator?

                                STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                The company provided one to deal with our 
                Tokyo consultants, but she made too many 
                  mistakes, so I hired my own.
                      (beat)
                While we re on the subject...  You are 
                fluent in Japanese, right?

  This as FOUR JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN approach and greet 
    Stephanie.  Introductions are made MOS.

                                CHANCE (V.O.)
                I guess we ll find out, won t we?

  We join them as sound returns, and one of the men says 
  something to Stephanie in Japanese.  Chance translates.

                                CHANCE (CONT'D)
                Mr. Saito wishes you congratulations on 
                the well-earned celebration.  They re 
                honored to be invited.

                                STEPHANIE
                Thank you, I m so glad you could be here.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      16.

    CONTINUED:


  As Chance translates, Stephanie catches the Japanese looking 
  at Chance a little sideways...  She tries to stay calm...

  Saito smiles, and turns to go, but then turns back and talks 
  to Chance.  Except Chance doesn t translate.  They re talking 
  to each other.  On Stephanie-- What the hell?  Chance appears 
  to be telling Saito a story.  Hand gestures, big inflection.  
  Unless you speak Japanese, you ll get none of it.  But it 
  sure sounds interesting.  As he finishes, the Japanese all 
  smile big, each shaking Chance s hand.  After they exit--

                                STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                What the hell was that?

                                CHANCE
                What the hell was what?

                                STEPHANIE
                They re our biggest consultants, I have 
                to work with them. What did you just say?

                                CHANCE
                They were surprised my dialect is satsuma-
                ben. I told them my father s father was 
                with MacArthur s staff in Tokyo, where he 
                  befriended a steward from a fishing 
                village on the island of Kyushu.  My 
                  grandfather sponsored the steward when he 
                came to the U.S. for college, where he 
                and my dad became lifelong friends.  And 
                he taught me to speak Japanese.

                                STEPHANIE
                      (totally charmed by that...)
                Wow, that s...  Is that true?

                                CHANCE
                No.  We shouldn t be the last to board, 
                let s go.

  Stephanie shakes her head, and they head to the train. But as 
  they do, Chance spots a SUSPICIOUS GUY in the crowd.  The Guy 
  had an eye on Stephanie and tried to look away...  Not in 
  time.  Chance clocks it...

                                                                              CUT TO:


  The Monterey Line runs through an LA suburb, still at its 
  modest urban cruising speed.  Ten passenger and cargo cars, 
  an engine at both front and back.  It s a good-looking train.

                                                                              CUT TO:              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      17.




  THE TRAIN SCREAMS BY.  A 200 MPH bullet, bound for San Fran.

                                                                TIME DISSOLVE TO:


  Guerrero sits on a park bench.  He s approached by LOWELL 
  (50s), balding and overweight.  Lowell, who looks like he s 
  had a bitch of a morning, sits down nearby Guerrero.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      29.

                              GUERRERO
                Thanks for coming.

                                LOWELL
                Sorry I m late.  It s been...  It s been 
                a rough morning.

                              GUERRERO
                I need some information about a guy who 
                works in your office.  Name s Mark 
                Hoffer, he s on the Sacramento desk.

                                LOWELL
                      (beat; an indignant glare)
                Is that supposed to be a joke?

                              GUERRERO
                Was it funny?

                                LOWELL
                Mister Guerrero...  I owe for what you 
                did for me and my family.  But there must 
                come a point at which I ve repaid that 
                debt.  Now I know what kind of a man you 
                are, so when you pull me out of the 
                office to ask these kinds of questions--

                              GUERRERO
                What are you talking about?

                                LOWELL
                Are you saying you don t know?

  Off Guerrero, at a loss--

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Chance slips into the crawl-space.  The wind is overwhelming.  
  Hard to keep his eyes open...  Hard to breathe...

  The space itself is open on three sides, made up of a loose 
  criss-cross of supports.  Above is the undercarriage of the 
  train.  Super-tight; very little room to maneuver.

  Chance hangs on to the supports above, with his feet wedged 
  into the side struts for support.  

                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      42.

    CONTINUED:


  He shimmies awkwardly down the crawl-space, straining to keep 
  his weight suspended over the bottom guard rail.

  He sees the brake-case, just needs to make it that far...  A 
  few more yards...  But, as he moves, his leg jerks back.  His 
  shoelace caught in the rigging...  Chance yanks at it, but 
  can t get it free...  Straining to hold himself up...  On his 
  undershirt, we see THE RED SPOTS JOINING, where the wound on 
  his chest is now worsening...

  Chance gives it one last pull...  His foot comes out of shoe, 
  the shoe falls onto the guardrail, and is then SUCKED IN BY 
  THE JETSTREAM...  ROCKETS AWAY LIKE A BULLET, OUT TO THE SIDE 
  OF THE TRAIN, and then UP IN THE AIR, riding the train s air 
  current like it was shot out of a cannon.  It s violent and 
  quick.  On Chance, resolving not to go the way of the shoe...

  He digs deep and regains his grip.  It takes all he s got, 
  but he REACHES THE BLACK BOX...  Feels around behind it...

                                                                              CUT TO:


  The tarp expands in the train s backdraft, BECOMING A 
  MAKESHIFT PARACHUTE, drifting up and away from the speeding 
  train, which rockets forward away from them...

  The trip up is the easy part.  As they fall, it becomes clear 
  that this thing ain t a parachute.  A messy, spiralling (but 
      non-life-threatening) drop, before--  

  THEY LAND ROUGHLY in the dirt.  Stephanie s wind is knocked 
  out of her, she heaves for air.  Lifts her head up just in 
  time to watch as--

  THE TRAIN REACHES THE CURVE AHEAD...  The lead car starts 
  around bend, but it can t hold the track...  THE FIRST CAR 
  CAREENS OFF THE RAILS and into a dusty flatland...  THE 
  TRAILING CARS JACK-KNIFE, piling up behind it, and carrying 
  the whole mess thundering forward...  It s the biggest damn 
  wreck you ve ever seen.

  As it finally comes to a rest, things get quiet again...  
  Stephanie notes that Chance never got up from the fall.

                                STEPHANIE
                Hey...  Hey!

  Chance doesn t answer.  Stephanie goes to him, not sure what 
  to do.  Concern turning to panic.

                                STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                Wake up...  Come on...

  Lifeless.  But after a beat, he coughs.  Comes around.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      56.

                Ow...

  Stephanie smiles her relief...

  We pull back on a tableau of the two of them...  The smoking 
  hulk of the bullet train off in the near distance...  The 
  SAFE CAR rolling by them, appreciably slowed down, and 
  coasting safely around the curve ahead...

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


  James s SUV pulls up to the house, as James, Stephanie and 
  Chance get out.  Both Stephanie and Chance have clearly been 
  treated; Stephanie bandaged, Chance s arm in a sling.

                The hitter is out of the picture.  But 
                somebody hired him, and somebody jammed 
                that door shut on us on the train.  Until

  porch, her knees pulled to her chest.  He stands in front of 
  her.  Her eyes stay on the ground as she speaks--

                I think you were wrong.

                                CHANCE
                There are 118 people who are alive

                                CHANCE
                I know what you re talking about...

  Chance moves closer to her, and places a hand on her head.  
  It s as intimate a moment as he ll allow himself.

                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                You did something you regret.  We re hard-
                wired to do things we regret.  It ain t 
                gonna change, it ain t something to be 
                afraid of, and it most certainly is not a 
                reason to die.

  Chance lingers.  Doesn t want to leave her.  She doesn t want 
  him to go.

                                STEPHANIE
                I don t even know what I owe you...
