    The ROAR of the bike is deafening.  Ryan storms across his 
    meticulously maintained lawn and looks over his back fence.

    RYAN S POV - ACROSS THE ALLEY

    Fenced yards and carports line the alley.  SPENCER, a scary-
    looking dude in his 40 s, sits atop his idling bike in his 
    carport.  He removes his helmet, glancing in Ryan s direction.

    ANGLE ON RYAN 

    Ryan quickly ducks down, furious, wishing he had the courage to 
    say something.  Spencer cuts the engine and the roar abruptly 
    quiets, allowing Ryan to hear the shouting of an (o.s.) irate 
    neighbor with an Australian accent.

                                MAN S VOICE
                  Fuck me, that s loud!  It s the 
                  middle of the bloody night!

    DOLLY ZOOM ON RYAN.  His expression suggests he s aware this 
    is a significant moment in his life, even if he doesn t yet 
    understand why.  He looks in the direction of the voice and 
    realizes it s coming from next door.  Jenna s house.   

                                JENNA (O.S.)
                  Wilfred, that s enough!

                                RYAN
                  (TO HIMSELF) Boyfriend.  Figures.

                                MAN S VOICE
                  You re lucky I m indoors, you prick!  
                  If I see that thing on the street, 
                  I ll punch your ass into your face!

    Jenna appears in her window and slides it closed.

                                JENNA
                  Stop it!

                                MAN S VOICE
                  Christ!  You know how long it took me 
                  to get comfortable?

    Jenna closes the blinds.  Ryan waits, but the yelling stops.  
    He heads back inside.          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             3.



    Ryan and Wilfred look at the once pristine lawn, now marred by 
    a dozen freshly dug holes.  Ryan is apoplectic.

                                RYAN
                  What did you--?  Why?! 

                                WILFRED
                  Anxiety.  Jenna s been away too long.  
                  She s a goner, I m sure of it.  
                  Probably choked on something.  A 
                  little piece of Lego or something. 

                                RYAN
                  She s just at work.  She ll be back.

                                WILFRED
                  Are you talking down to me?

                                RYAN
                  What?  No--

                                WILFRED
                  You re talking down to me.  I open up 
                  to you, and you talk down to me.          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             12.


    Wilfred angrily grabs a shovel and resumes digging.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  You have any idea what it s like to 
                  feel abandoned?  To lose the one 
                  thing in life that makes you happy?  

    PUSH IN on Ryan as he starts putting it all together.

                                RYAN
                  Yeah, I do.  God, I haven t thought 
                  about this in years, but when I was a 
                  kid, I had this cute little dog.  
                  Sparky.  I loved him so much and--

    Wilfred stops digging.

                                WILFRED
                  You know Buck?

                                RYAN
                  Who?

                                WILFRED
                  Buck.  Black lab, about my age, great 
                  teeth.  You know him?

                                RYAN
                  I don t know Buck.

                                WILFRED
                  And you won t, because he s gone.  
                  One day he s running around by the 
                  tennis courts at the park, the next 
                  day, bam!

                                RYAN
                  Hit by a car?

                                WILFRED
                  No, we just kind of lost touch.  

                                RYAN
                  Bam, you just kind of lost touch?  

                                WILFRED
                  Life is short, Ryan.  You gotta start 
                  listening to your heart before the 
                  worms inside it grow so big it 
                  explodes.  Like poor old Shasta.

                                RYAN
                  He had heartworm?

                                WILFRED
                  She... was hit by a car.  Pay 
                  attention. (THEN) Ryan, I know your 
                  type.  
                                (MORE)        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             13.

                                WILFRED (CONT'D)
                  You re a good boy and you come when 
                  you re called and you don t drag your 
                  ass on the carpet.  Aren t you tired 
                  of doing what everyone else wants you 
                  to do?  Maybe it s time you found the 
                  courage to quit playing ball with 
                  them...

    He holds up an old tennis ball.  Where did that come from? 

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  ...and just play ball with me.

                                RYAN
                  (SUSPICIOUS) I don t think so.

                                WILFRED
                  Go on.  Give it a toss. 

                                RYAN
                  Something doesn t feel right.

                                WILFRED
                  What s the matter, you throw like a 
                  girl?  No judgments, just throw the--

                                RYAN
                  (FIRMLY) No.

    It s a standoff, as if playing ball has become a test of 
    wills.  Which, of course, it has.  Wilfred backs off.

                RYAN (CONT D)WILFRED
    I have to go to work--Let s take a walk.

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  I don t have time for a walk.

                                WILFRED
                  Ryan, you re already upset about your 
                  lawn, right?  Well, I ve got enough 
                  piss in me to kill what s left of it. 


      A cigarette dangles from Wilfred s lips as they walk.  Ryan 
    watches the reactions of passersby, but no one bats an eye at 
    Wilfred.  They stop at a tree.  Ryan is impatient.

                                RYAN
                  (RE: TREE) This one?

    Wilfred considers it, then shrugs and ambles on.  (During the 
    following, a pretty girl passes by and pets Wilfred.  He 
    glances after her, appreciative.)

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  Tell me about Jenna.          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             14.


                                WILFRED
                  Why? 

                                RYAN
                  I d like to get to know her.

                                WILFRED
                  Sorry mate, you re not her type.

                                RYAN
                  Why not?

                                WILFRED
                  Well, for one thing, she s not into 
                  guys with ginormous heads.

    Ryan touches his head, self-conscious.  

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  Not sure how your neck puts up with 
                  it, but I know Jenna wouldn t be 
                  interested.  Maybe you can find a lady 
                  scientist looking to study 
                  gravitational forces or something.

                                RYAN
                  (DEFENSIVE) It s a little oversized.  
                  That just means I have a big brain.

                                WILFRED
                  Or a small brain with a thick crust.  
                  Either way, Jenna s out of your league.

                                RYAN
                  How can you say that?  You don t know 
                  anything about me. 

                                WILFRED
                  I know what you did last night.  

    Ryan stops short, surprised by Wilfred s directness.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  I know you think there s no hope.  I 
                  know you re a failure.  I know you 
                  wasted your past as you strove to 
                  meet the expectations of others while 
                  allowing your own dreams to wither 
                  and die, and worse, to be forgotten.  

                                RYAN
                  (UNNERVED) How... how do you--?

    Wilfred is suddenly in Ryan s face.

                                WILFRED
                  Because I am you.  We are one mind.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             15.


    Ryan is freaked.  Wilfred breaks into a smile.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  Just fucking with you.  I read your  
                  little snuff letter while you were 
                  passed out.  Found it a bit wordy, 
                  actually.  It could use another pass. 
                  (CHUCKLES)  Strove.   Really?

                                RYAN
                  (SIGHS, FRUSTRATED) There s gotta be 
                  more to life than this. 

    Wilfred finally finds a tree good enough to pee on.  He 
    relieves himself while they talk.

                                WILFRED
                  C mon now, is it that bad, mate?

                                RYAN
                  Well, let s see.  I graduated from a 
                  very expensive law school and went 
                  straight to work for my father.  Then 
                  I made a rookie mistake.  I told the 
                  truth.  Dad s firm lost half its 
                  clients overnight and I was disbarred 
                  the same day my first student loan 
                  payment was due.

    Wilfred finishes up and they resume walking.  (As they walk,  
    Wilfred and a passing surfer exchange cool  wassup  nods. )

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  Kristen s right, a job is a job.  

                                WILFRED
                  Look, Ryan, if you want my advice--

                                RYAN
                  Actually, I don t.  I ve got enough 
                  people telling me what to do.    

                                WILFRED
                  (HURT) Just trying to help.  You 
                  don t have to be a dick.

                                RYAN
                  Are you done?  I need to get to work.

    A passing MAN smiles at Wilfred.

                                MAN
                  Hey, poochy poochy.

                                WILFRED
                  Fuck off.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             16.



    Ryan and Wilfred walk home.  

                                WILFRED
                  It s like me, when I m eating out the 
                  ass of a dead possum.  I m eating out 
                  his guts through his ass.  I get my 
                  teeth right in there.  No one taught 
                  me that.  I just did it one day.  It 
                  happened.  Been doing it ever since. 

                                RYAN
                  (DISGUSTED) Interesting.  Ever tried 
                  Korean?  I think you d like it.

                                WILFRED
                  You re missing the point.  I m not 
                  just saying that possum ass is 
                  delicious -- it is.  What I m saying 
                  is, I m true to my nature.  I don t 
                  over-think everything.  I act on 
                  instinct.  

                                RYAN
                  You re an animal. 

                                WILFRED
                  We re all animals, Ryan.

    Spencer ROARS past them on his motorcycle.  Wilfred chases 
    after him.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  I ll kill you!

    Spencer turns down an alley, followed by Wilfred.  Alarmed, 
    Ryan runs after them.

                                RYAN
                  Wilfred!  Stay!  Come!


    Ryan rounds the corner and catches up to Wilfred.  Spencer 
    screeches to a halt in his carport and leaps off his bike. 

                                SPENCER
                  Where s his leash?  He s lucky I 
                  didn t kick his teeth in.

                                WILFRED
                  Try it and lose a foot!

                                RYAN
                  (TO WILFRED) No!  I mean it! 

    His forceful tone surprises Wilfred, who backs off, annoyed.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             17.


                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  (TO SPENCER) It won t happen again.

                                SPENCER
                  If it does, someone s getting his 
                  nuts cut off.

    Spencer exits into his yard and the gate slams shut.  

                                WILFRED
                  (TO RYAN) He means me.  You obviously 
                  don t have any.

                                RYAN
                  You re right.  I should ve challenged 
                  him to a knife fight. 

                                WILFRED
                  You let that shit-stain walk all over 
                  us.  Your father was right.  You re a 
                  pussy.

                                RYAN
                  When did he say that?

                                WILFRED
                  Okay, he didn t, I made that up.  But 
                  you are a pussy.

                                RYAN
                  I don t need to listen to this.  

                                WILFRED
                  Ryan, I m not telling you anything 
                  you don t already know.  Fear has 
                  made you a weak.  Fear is the mind 
                  killer.  Fear is the little death 
                  that brings total obliteration.

                                RYAN
                  That s from  Dune.   How do you know 
                  that?

                                WILFRED
                  How do you know that?

    They stare at each other for a beat, then Wilfred produces the 
    tennis ball.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  C mon, mate.  Have a throw.  What are 
                  you afraid of?

                                RYAN
                  I m not afraid.  But that s not just 
                  a ball--        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             18.


                                WILFRED
                  Of course it is. 

    He aggressively bounces the ball off Ryan s head.  

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  See?  It s a ball.

                                RYAN
                  Why are you pushing so hard--?

                                WILFRED
                  I m feeling playful! (SHOVES BALL AT 
                  HIM) No more questions!  Stop 
                  thinking and throw the damn ball!

                                RYAN
                  No!

    He slaps the ball out of Wilfred s hand.  It sails over the 
    fence and into Spencer s yard!  Wilfred is very upset.  He 
    moves in on Ryan, who backs away nervously.  

                                WILFRED
                  What did you do?!  

                                RYAN
                  I m sorry.  I didn t mean to--

                                WILFRED
                  You re a naughty boy!  

                                RYAN
                  I ll get you another ball!

                                WILFRED
                  I don t want another ball!

                                JENNA (O.S.)
                  Hey.

    Ryan turns to see Jenna, who has just entered the alley from 
    her back yard.  Ryan is glad to see her.

                                RYAN
                  Hey!  Look, Wilfred, it s Jenna!

                                JENNA
                  I hope he wasn t any trouble.

                                RYAN
                  Not at all.  He s adorable. 

                                JENNA
                  Wilfred, did you make a new friend?

    His resentful eyes are locked on Ryan.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             19.


                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  (TO RYAN) You wanna come in and have 
                  a glass of wine? 

    Wilfred subtly shakes his head  don t even think about it.   
    Ryan hesitates.

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  Don t be polite, I hate polite.  
                  C mon, I insist.

    Ryan looks at Wilfred, who frowns.


    Hands trembling, Ryan opens his own gate, hurries into his 
    yard, and promptly drops out of sight.

                                RYAN
                  Ahhh!

    ANGLE ON RYAN, lying flat on his back in one of the holes dug 
    by Wilfred, scared shitless.


                                  END OF ACT TWO        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             24.


                                      ACT THREE

    BLACK SCREEN

                                WILFRED (V.O.)
                  (ECHOING) You broke my heart, Ryan.  
                  Better sleep with your eyes open.

    The RUMBLE of Spencer s motorcycle crescendos into a ROAR...


    Ryan walks through the darkened yard to where Wilfred sits.

                                RYAN
                  What do you want?

                                WILFRED
                  I want my fucking ball.

                                RYAN
                  Really?  That all this is about?

                                WILFRED
                  Ryan, when I was a young  un, I had a 
                  bit of an oral fixation. (RE: 
                  CIGARETTE) Still do, I guess.  But 
                  when I was little I was a bit mouthy, 
                  and I was too dumb to know the 
                  difference between a knot of rawhide 
                  and a fine Italian loafer.  Someone 
                  would adopt me, I d have a bit of a 
                  chew, and then it was back to the 
                  pound we go.  Italian Loafer guy, he 
                  gave me a good beating.  Kicked me so 
                  hard I got hip displeasure.

                                RYAN
                  Dysplasia.

                                WILFRED
                  No, it didn t get that bad.  But I 
                  was at the end of the line, on death 
                  row.  And then a kindly old woman at 
                  the shelter gave me a tennis ball.  
                  That tennis ball.  I could chew 
                  without shame, and suddenly I was 
                  lovable.  That ball saved my life.  I 
                  need it back, and I can t get through 
                  that gate without you.

                                RYAN
                  Why not?

    Wilfred is getting impatient.  He stubs out his cigarette and 
    flicks it away with great dexterity, then holds up his paw.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             27.


                                WILFRED
                  (RE: PAW) I can t undo the latch, 
                  mate.  Think about it.

                                RYAN
                  Alright, here s the deal.  I ll help 
                  you, and then you stay away from me.  
                  Forever.

                                WILFRED
                  If that s what you want.

                                RYAN
                  Shake on it.

    He extends his hand.  Wilfred just looks at it.

                                WILFRED
                  Yeah, I never learned that trick, but 
                  you have my word.


    Wilfred watches Ryan try to open Spencer s gate.  It s locked.  

                                WILFRED
                  Use a credit card, genius.

    Ryan uses a card from his wallet.  The latch opens.  They 
    enter into:


    Ryan searches the unkempt yard, calling in a hushed whisper.

                                RYAN
                  I found it!

    SMASH!  Ryan looks over to see Wilfred standing by a broken 
    window next to the back door.  

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  What are you doing!?

                                WILFRED
                  (TAPS HIS MUZZLE) The nose knows.

    He reaches in, unlocks the door and enters.  Ryan follows.


    Wilfred and an elated Ryan carry the pot plants to the gate.  

                                RYAN
                  I can t believe I did that!  That was 
                  so awesome!

                                WILFRED
                  Well done, Ryan.  Primo coiler.  One 
                  of the best I ve seen.

    A distant but familiar RUMBLE is coming closer.  Spencer s 
      motorcycle.  

                                RYAN
                  Shit!

    They run to the gate.  Ryan tries to open it.

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  It s jammed!

    Wilfred grabs the pot plants and tosses them over the fence.


      A headlight appears at the end of the alley!   Ryan and 
    Wilfred scramble over the fence, grab the plants and dash into 
    Ryan s yard just as Spencer pulls into his carport.


    CLOSE ON A FURRY PAW as it carefully places Ryan s wallet 
    under the broken window at Spencer s house.  Ryan s ID is 
    clearly visible.
