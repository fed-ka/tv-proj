SENATE HEARING ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
Blinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit
in the audience, showing their support for THEODORE HAYES,
a 50-year-old civilian.
This is his confirmation hearing.
Reading from prepared material:
HAYES
... last few years have brought many
advances in the interests of women
in naval service, particularly in
the land-based maritime specialties.
What's more, the Navy has instituted
special sensitivity courses with an
eye on --
DEHAVEN
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
"Land-based
maritime specialties." Gimme a
second here to de-euphemize that...
At the center of a dais, LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to
ponder the ceiling of the hearing room.
Her plaque card
reads "CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE." DeHaven is a
tough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara at 60.
In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades --
and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim.
DEHAVEN
Would that be anything like
"typing"?
"Restocking the
cupboards"?
That sort of thing, Mr.
Hayes?
CHUCKLES from the packed gallery.
The flag officers go
stone-faced.
Hayes forces a smile.
HAYES
Hardly the case, Senator.
DEHAVEN
Well, I'm just an old dame without
much time left, so you'll pardon me
if I jump right in here before they
discontinue my blood-type.
I am
deeply concerned over the Navy's
seemingly incontrovertible attitude
toward women in the military.
Case
in point...
On cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members
of the dais.
Hayes gets a copy, too.
And it jars him.
DEHAVEN
"The Lark Report."
HAYES
Madam Senator... this is an internal
document of the U.S. Navy.
I must
seriously question whether --
DEHAVEN
(to others on panel)
The Navy's conclusion regarding the
crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft
carrier.
Female aviator, it just so
happens.
(to Hayes)
You're familiar with this report and
its conclusion, am I right?
HAYES
I was one member of the investigating
commission.
DEHAVEN
Yes, I see your signature right here
-- twice the size of everyone
else's.
And your conclusion was
"pilot error," hmm?
HAYES
I'm really not prepared for any kind
of in-depth review of --
DEHAVEN
I'd like to think our next Secretary
of the Navy would be prepared for
anything, Mr. Hayes.
A humorless smile.
She's roasting his nuts over an open
fire, and everyone knows it.
HAYES
The commission concluded that the
aviator in question failed to
execute a proper approach to the
carrier.
DEHAVEN
That aside for the moment, I'm
struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit
of your report... the degrading
remarks by other aviators...
innuendo about her performance in
unrelated situations... even a
reference to her sexual activity the
weekend prior.
(closing report)
In my seven years on this committee,
I've never seen a downed aviator
treated like this.
Never.
I'm
deeply disturbed by this report, Mr.
Hayes.
Not just what it bodes for
women in the military -- but for
your own confirmation as well.
CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
Heading for her office, DeHaven is escorted by a small
PRESS RETINUE.
DEHAVEN
... a full 35 percent of all jobs in
the U.S. military are still, to this
day, off-limits to women.
And
that's simply gotta change.
PRESS #1
What about those who say women
aren't suited for all jobs?
That
they're physically weaker... they
have less stamina...
DEHAVEN
Sure.
And we're gonna hog the
bathroom, too.
DEHAVEN'S AIDE catches up, pulls her aside.
DEHAVEN'S AIDE
White House boys want a private
meeting.
DEHAVEN
I'll act surprised.
DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
Shoes dumped on her desk, DeHaven changes out knee-high
stockings while devoting one ear to...
WHITE HOUSE #1
... to reassure you that he has
every faith in the ability of Mr.
Hayes to guide the Navy into the
next century.
The task, as the
Administration sees it, is to
acknowledge changing realities
without losing traditional values.
A beat.
DeHaven looks between the two WHITE HOUSE boys --
#1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier.
DEHAVEN
'Zat it?
Ten minutes, nothin' on
the table?
Sweetcakes, you best go
back to the President and tell him
to open up the phone book and start
lookin' for his next nominee.
White House #1 looks spanked.
Taking over, #2 pops a
briefcase.
An inch-think report appears before DeHaven.
WHITE HOUSE #2
Administration's plan for 100
percent integration.
If female
candidates measure up in a series of
test cases, the President will
support full integration within
three years' time.
Surprised -- maybe even startled -- DeHaven flips through
the report, absorbing by osmosis.
WHITE HOUSE #2
It's your gender-blind Navy,
Senator.
Surely you're not going to
balk now.
DEHAVEN
Well, it's just that askin' you all
to integrate the Navy is like
sending a man to do a woman's job.
(a beat)
How do you propose to handle the
Combat Exclusion Laws?
WHITE HOUSE #2
Keep narrowing the definitions.
Keep redefining.
WHITE HOUSE #1
We got around it in Saudi Arabia.
DEHAVEN
By calling women "Honorary Men."
Ingenious.
WHITE HOUSE #2
C'mon, Senator, President's pitchin'
right down the center of your plate.
If women measure up to men, they've
got the job.
You going to take a
swing?
Or step out of the box?
DeHaven riffles the edges of the report, thinking it over.
Thinking light years ahead.
HAYES' LIMOUSINE - DAY
Inside the moving car:
HAYES
So she picks the women, we pick the
programs.
Seals?
FLAG OFFICER #1
I'd go Special Reconnaissance.
Every bit as tough -- and we have a
60 percent drop-out rate among the
men.
HAYES
Then I suggest we start there.
FLAG OFFICER #1
Doesn't matter who she picks.
No
woman is going to last one week in a
commando training course.
And I
don't care who it is.
SITUATION ROOM - N.I.C. - DAY
ROYCE
All right, stand by, we're going to
switch over to COMSAT...
A TACTICAL OFFICER reroutes the call via defense
satellite, cryptography flashing on terminals.
Lieutenant
Commander ROBERT ROYCE joins other Intel officers at a
conference table.
They're pouring over weather charts,
navigation logs, high-altitude NRO video.
TACTICAL OFFICER
Voice-system now secure...
ROYCE
(into speaker)
Okay, fresh stuff:
Lost a NATO
plane over the Sea of Japan.
ELB
signals leads us to believe the
pilot is alive and has made his way
to the North Korean shore, near a
fishing village, "Tamyung."
JORDAN (V.O.)
Do we know it's him using the
beacon?
Not a decoy?
ROYCE
Signals received only sparingly, in
such a pattern that leads us to
conclude it is a downed aviator
trying to conserve his batteries.
JORDAN (V.O.)
Chances of recovery?
ROYCE
You're the analyst for East China,
O'Neil.
Analyze.
CORRIDOR - N.I.C. - DAY
Jordan exits a locker room.
Smoothing out her Khaki
uniform, she heads down a broad corridor with cipher-lock
doors.
Falling in step:
ROYCE
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
JORDAN
Thank you, sir.
We hear back from
the Pentagon?
ROYCE
(scoffing)
Probably hear back from CNN first.
JORDAN
Hate this part.
Just sweating it
out on the sidelines.
ROYCE
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant
-- no matter how subtle.
Now they reach...
BULLPEN - N.I.C. - DAY
A circular chamber.
Dominating the ground floor is the
bullpen, a hive of cubicles an computer stations.
On the
second floor are executive offices, ringing the bullpen.
ROYCE
By the way, I'll need that option
paper by 11-hundred today so I can
review it with Admiral Hanover.
And
do we have any of that breakfast tea
around here?
JORDAN
(with a look)
Is this my glory, sir?
On the upper walkway, a frazzled N.I.C. SECRETARY
appears.
She spots Royce and Jordan below.
N.I.C. SECRETARY
Excuse me, but I have Senator
DeHaven on the line for you.
ROYCE
Jesus God, what now?
He bounds up the stairs toward his office.
N.I.C. SECRETARY
I'm sorry, sir no -- she asked to
speak with Lieutenant O'Neil.
Royce turns back and gives Jordan a hall-of-fame look.
"Oh, really?"
DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
DEHAVEN
(into phone)
So everyone I talk to says you're
top drawer with silk stockings
inside.
JORDAN (V.O.)
Thank you, ma'am.
Um, may I ask
what this is regarding?
DEHAVEN
(reading file)
High-school pentathlete... ROTC
scholarship, graduated with
honors... top marks in Basic
Training... and, as it just so
happens, a constituent of my home
state of Virginia.
Oh, the things
I'll do for one extra vote.
BULLPEN - N.I.C. - DAY
On the phone, Jordan glances around.
Co-workers mull
within earshot.
Those out of earshot post E-mail memos on
Jordan's computer:
"Moving up in life."
"I want a full
report."
"Don't tell her who you really voted for."
DEHAVEN
Lieutenant O'Neil, I am prepared to
nominate you for the Navy's Special
Reconnaissance program.
Should you
accept, you'll ship out to Coronado
next week and join in the big
testosterone festival.
Complete the
course, and you'll have a fast
ticket to any assignment you want.
That's my personal promise to you.
A beat as Jordan's mind catches up to her ears.
Now
INTERRCUTTING the two:
JORDAN
"Coronado."
DEHAVEN
California.
JORDAN
I know that, sir.
Ma'am.
It's just
that... Beggin' your pardon,
Senator, but... do you understand
that this involves combat training?
DEHAVEN
This is just a test case, O'Neil.
But if it works out -- if you work
out -- it could well change the
Navy's official policy on women in
combat.
Or, actually, its official
non-policy.
Now who's your
immediate superior there?
JORDAN
Captain Dwyer.
Technically.
DEHAVEN
My office will fill him in and help
expedite.
Look forward to meeting
you at the proper time.
Jumping off
now...
JORDAN
Uh, question, ma'am.
DEHAVEN
Yes, dear.
JORDAN
Would I be the only one?
The only
woman?
DEHAVEN
There'll be more to follow -- but
yes, dear, right now you're the pick
of a very large litter.
And your
success would mean a lot.
Jumping,
now...
The line goes dead.
Jordan hangs up catatonically.
JORDAN
Well, shit-a-doodle-do...
JORDAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
It's not so much furnished as equipped -- scuba gear and
wetsuits in the mud room, life vests on coat racks, a
training bag and boxing gloves hanging in the living room.
In the kitchen we find...
A naked man.
He's steeping tea.
JORDAN (O.S.)
... well, I survived Basic Training
and three brothers -- so I know how
to fight.
What scares me are the
sexual politics.
I don't want to be
turned into some poster girl for
women's rights.
CAMERA FOLLOWS as the naked man carries a steaming mug
through the house...
BATHROOM - JORDAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
... and sets it down beside Jordan, languishing in a tub.
Snow builds on a window sill.
Facing Jordan, the man
slides into the tub.
ROYCE
So why're you even considering it?
Are you?
JORDAN
Just like you would be.
ROYCE
Spec-Recon.
Those guys are world-
class warriors.
And they will not
want you there, Jordan.
JORDAN
I take it you don't either.
Feet.
Dutifully, Royce massages her feet.
ROYCE
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at
Intel.
JORDAN
Royce.
We're the same age, we
started the same time -- and now
you're sitting in the upperdecks
while I'm still down in the bullpen.
What does that tell you about the
Navy?
ROYCE
(shaking head)
She's haze grey and underway...
JORDAN
You need operational duty to really
advance... you need combat training
to go operational... yet combat
training is off-limits to people
with tits.
I'm topped out at Intel.
Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm
beating my head on a big brass
ceiling.
ROYCE
So dump on me.
JORDAN
This has nothing to do with you.
ROYCE
(getting out)
Well, guess I don't even need to be
here...
JORDAN
Get your dick back here.
It has
everything to do with you.
ROYCE
You're such a ball-breaker
sometimes.
Especially at night.
JORDAN
Sorry.
But after our days...
(a thoughtful sip)
So if I try this thing... if I ship
out to Coronado... what happens
here?
ROYCE
I'll try to keep the door open.
If
you wash out, I make it so that --
JORDAN
Wai', wait.
What happens if it
works?
Four months of training,
three years of operational duty.
What then?
ROYCE
(blowing a sigh)
I don't feel like doing an option
paper on the rest of my life,
Jordan.
Maybe we should just let it
happen.
JORDAN
Which is guy-speak for...
ROYCE
(conceding)
Sounded lame as soon as it came out
of my mouth.
But I'm trying to be
honest, okay?
Three years is a long
time.
Don't ask me to predict how
I'll feel then, Jordan, because I
don't know.
And either do you.
JORDAN
You know, right up until you said
that -- I thought I did know.
Wounded, she gets out.
ROYCE
Jordan...
JORDAN
Thank you, Royce.
It was shaping up
like such a tough call -- and then
you go and make it so goddamn easy.
Really, thank you so much.
She punches into a robe and leaves.
Royce considers
drowning himself in the tub.
ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
JORDAN
Excuse me, lieutenant.
I was told
this is where I check in.
A DUTY OFFICER looks up to find Jordan across a counter.
In no particular hurry, the duty officer makes his way
over to check Jordan's orders.
DUTY OFFICER
(looking up)
So you're the one.
Hearing, other workers look up.
Among them is a female
ensign, KATHY BLONDELL -- no makeup, no nail polish, no
concession to her sex.
Throughout, she'll watch Jordan
with more than passing interest.
JORDAN
Still don't have my bearings yet.
Direct me to the officer's quarters?
The duty officer stamps her paperwork, returns it with
room assignment and keys.
DUTY OFFICER
You'll proceed directly to the
infirmary for eye tests, blood
tests, urinalysis, pregnancy test.
Uniform issue adjacent.
Then you're
to report to the Base Commander.
He'd like a word with you.
JORDAN
Fine.
And the officer's quarters?
DUTY OFFICER
C.O.'s office can supply you with
directions.
Enjoy your visit,
lieutenant.
It's a nasty little barb -- one that Jordan decides to let
slide.
Jordan turns for the door.
Blondell catches up
with a base map.
BLONDELL
B.O.Q., south side.
Take a
starboard tack out the door.
JORDAN
Thank you, ensign.
BLONDELL
No problem, lieutenant.
C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
A soft KNOCKING.
C.O.
Come.
A YEOMAN opens the door.
Behind him is Jordan.
YEOMAN
Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil reporting,
sir.
For a beat, COMMANDING OFFICER (C.O.) TURRENTINE takes
stock of the female in his doorway, sizing her up like a
fighter across the ring.
Then he stubs out a perfectly
good cigar, rises with an amiable face, and touches the
back of a chair -- stopping just short of pulling it out
for her.
C.O.
Yes, of course.
Please, have a
seat, lieutenant...
JORDAN
Thank you, sir.
C.O.
Would you care for a beverage?
Tea?
JORDAN
I'm fine, sir.
C.O.
So.
We're still coming to terms
with the exact protocol for this --
for integrating the Spec-Recon
training.
It may not always be
smooth, but we're trying to make it
as painless as possible for you.
JORDAN
Thank you, sir.
But I expect a
certain amount of pain.
More stock-taking.
Is he looking at her hair?
JORDAN
Barber was my next stop, sir.
Would've had it regulation sooner,
only --
C.O.
Don't worry about it.
If it's off
your collar and out of your eyes,
that's all I'm going to ask.
JORDAN
Really, I have no problem with --
C.O.
I'm not out to change your sex,
lieutenant.
You'll have separate
beds, separate heads.
If you have
specific medical needs, inform the
infirmary.
If a classmate or
superior acts in an harassing or
otherwise unbecoming manner, please
inform me immediately so I can deal
with it immediately.
Questions?
JORDAN
None at this time, sir.
C.O.
Then that's all I have to say.
Dismissed.
Another smile, another phantom gesture on the back of her
chair.
If Jordan was expecting a fight, the bell never
sounded.
She rises, salutes -- then turns back at the
door.
JORDAN
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm
not here to make a statement.
I
don't want to make men look foolish.
All I care about is completing the
training and getting operational
experience -- just like everyone
else, I suspect.
C.O.
If you were like everyone else,
lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be
making statements about not making
statements, would we?
(a beat)
Take your leave.
ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Blondell is ending her shift.
She shoulders a purse and
pauses at a window, seeing...
The trainees shuffling into formation like the living
dead.
Jordan is still among them.
ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
BLONDELL'S POV:
Of a lone figure crossing to the bell.
MESS HALL - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Dead-ass tired, Jordan slides her tray down the line,
piling on food that means nothing more than raw calories.
She heads for...
A table of trainees, one spot open.
Seeing her coming,
the guys shift position.
Suddenly the table is full.
ENGLAND
Better look elsewhere, O'Neil.
Jordan glares.
None of them meet her eyes.
She wheels
around -- and now all eyes are on her, watching her ass
walk away.
FEATURE Slutnik, the walking sperm bank.
SLUTNIK
Half a night, Lord, just gimme half
a night to set her straight...
Jordan tries another table.
This one, too, becomes
abruptly full.
As Jordan leaves, HOLD on Miller.
He's a
human eclipse -- six-three, 220, the perfect commando
physique.
Instructors wish they could clone him.
MILLER
Average woman is 25 percent body
fat.
That's one-quarter fat, man.
Think about that.
MCCOOL
Nice distribution, though.
MILLER
No way does she makes this program.
No way.
After wandering the mess hall like a homeless person,
Jordan finds refuge at a table with female mess stewards.
They look at her with blank faces.
No understanding.
No
compassion.
JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Two beds.
Matching lockers.
A desk, a chair, a mirror.
All overwhelmingly dull.
Jordan drops the robe off her shoulders to take inventory
of her body.
Both sides of her neck are bruised from the
phone-pole run.
Her back and thighs are sand-burned.
Mirror cuts abound.
She's already a mess.
Jordan uncaps some cologne.
It's a vestige of her old
life she's not going to surrender.
She sniffs.
Savors.
Dabs.
Looks back in the mirror...
And breaks out laughing.
It's like dropping a rose in a
cesspool.
JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Jordan pushes inside -- and stops when she sees the little
two-step platform.
That awful crutch.
Someone has put it
beside her bed.
Jordan wheels around to check...
C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
C.O.
All right, lieutenant, give me a
name and specifics, I'll have the
X.O. file an action first thing in
the morning.
(waits)
A name?
JORDAN
It's you, sir.
And it started the
day I came here.
C.O.
(jolted)
Oh, really.
JORDAN
It's this double-standard, the
separate quarters, the deferential
treatment.
It's how you pulled out
my chair and nearly served high tea
the first time we met.
C.O.
Because I was civil, now you're
complaining.
JORDAN
I can't afford civility, sir.
How
am I supposed to fit in with these
guys when you've got me set up as an
outsider?
Even if I make it under
these rules, I still lose, because
there'll always be a flag in my file
-- "Yeah, she made it, but..."
I
mean, really -- why didn't you just
issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear
around the base?
C.O.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
JORDAN
Pardon?
C.O.
Did you just barge in here and curse
at your base commander?
If so, I
regard that as a bonafide brain-
fart, and I resent it when people
fart inside my home.
JORDAN
I think you've resented me from the
start, sir.
Now, finally, her opponent steps into the ring.
And he's
a bare-knuckle brawler.
C.O.
(building)
What I resent, lieutenant, is some
politician using my base as a test
tube for her grand social
experiment.
What I resent is the
sensitivity training that is now
mandatory for my men... the day-care
center I have to build where an
officer's lounge used to be... and
the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff
just so someone can keep track of
your personal pap smears.
(drawing close)
But most of all, lieutenant, I
resent your perfume, however subtle
it may be, competing with the aroma
of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty-
nine cent cigar, which I will
happily put out this very instant if
the phallic nature of it happens to
offend your goddamn fragile
sensibilities.
DOES IT?
JORDAN
No, sir.
C.O.
No, sir, WHAT?
JORDAN
The shape doesn't bother me.
It's
just that goddamn rotten stench.
A dangerous beat -- before the C.O. disengages.
C.O.
Well.
'Least now we're talking the
same language.
(a beat)
So one standard.
Is that what
you're after?
JORDAN
Same rules for everyone, sir.
C.O.
Straight up?
JORDAN
Across the board, sir.
C.O.
And if you just happen to wash out,
I won't have to contend with you
bitchin' to some hairy-chested
female Senator?
And please note I
did not identify any one in
particular.
JORDAN
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
A deciding beat.
C.O.
Then good night.
JORDAN
So I'll get a fair shot?
C.O.
You'll get everything you want,
O'Neil.
Let's see if you want what
you're gonna get.
BARBER SHOP - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
Jordan gets her hair cut to regulation length.
It's over
in seconds.
ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
Jordan slaps down old room keys and new orders.
Blondell
scans the paperwork with deepening concern.
BLONDELL
This some kind of joke?
JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
Jordan tosses her belongings into a laundry bag.
She
slings the bag over her shoulder, boots aside the hated
two-step on her way out...
B.O.Q. ROOM - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
... and bangs open a door.
Slutnik sits up on his bed.
SLUTNIK
Well, who the shit you think you
are?
Comin' in here like that?
JORDAN
Your new roommate.
Slutnik's face curdles.
Jordan dumps her bag on an open
bunk and starts unpacking.
JORDAN
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
SLUTNIK
Hey, hey, HEY.
No possibility.
You
can't stay in here.
You can't sleep
right next to me.
JORDAN
Funny, the C.O. says I can.
She slaps orders on his chest, continues to unpack.
SLUTNIK
Aw, lookit this, lookit this --
she's bringin' Tampax in here.
C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms
over there.
JORDAN
That your desk?
I'll take this one.
SLUTNIK
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
JORDAN
(whirling on him)
Listen, Sex Ape.
I'm here to stay.
And if you don't want me for a
roommate or classmate, you got two
options -- move out or ring out.
End of file.
Slutnik stalks out.
Jordan fires a look at the innocent
bystander here, McCool.
He was studying at his desk when
the fireworks began.
JORDAN
What about you, McCool?
Any problem
with the room assignment?
McCool -- an imperturbable black lieutenant -- just goes
back to his manuals.
MCCOOL
"It's not a job -- it's an
adventure."
INSTRUCTOR'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
The instructors are shuffling muster lists, reorganizing
the class.
B.G., the BELL TOLLS again and again.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
(shaking head)
Miller.
Thought the guy was made of
depleted uranium.
Really didn't
expect to lose him.
THE CHIEF
Every class has its surprises, Pyro.
This one'll be no different.
C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
P.R. FLAK
(reading newspaper)
"... last week at Coronado.
The
woman, identity unknown, is believed
to be the first female candidate for
the elite Special Reconnaissance
program.
Her presence could signal
a shift in the Navy's long-standing
policy that excludes women from
combat positions."
The P.R. FLAK drops the newspaper on the C.O.'s desk.
It's the San Diego Tribune.
Under the headline "G.I.
JANE," a photo shows a chesty sailor running the obstacle
course.
C.O.
(calling O.S.)
I'm asking again.
Where is she?
YEOMAN
Inbound now, sir.
Had to pull her
out of the dive bell.
P.R. FLAK
I have interview requests from two
local TV stations.
And a
sociologist from U.C. San Diego
called, wanted to know if she could
examine the interaction between
"G.I. Jane" and the men.
C.O.
"A sociol..."
Kill the interviews.
I don't need civilians nosin' around
in matters that are supposed to be
covert in nature.
Just kill 'em
before this whole thing gets outta
con --
YEOMAN
Senator DeHaven calling, sir.
The C.O. gets an instant headache.
SENATE BARBER SHOP - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
C.O. (V.O.)
Base Commander Turrentine speaking.
In the Senate barber shop, DeHaven is having her hair
colored.
She holds a fax of the Tribune article in one
hand, a cell phone in the other.
DEHAVEN
(hitting like a Scud)
Commander, are you of the habit of
letting photographers traipse around
your base snappin' their fill?
These were supposed to have been
discreet test cases --
INTERRCUTTING:
C.O.
Senator, they stand out on the
public highway with telephoto
lenses --
DEHAVEN
-- and now I got reporters from
Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office
and askin' what I know about this
"G.I. Jane" thing.
C.O.
-- nothing I can do about it unless
you're suggesting I infringe on
their civil liberties -- which I'd
happily do if you'll just trim a
little fat off the Constitution.
DEHAVEN
Are you truly mouthin' off to a
senior member of the Senate Arms
Committee?
I mean, I'll give you
points for style -- just nothin' for
smarts.
C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
The C.O. double-takes as Jordan enters:
She's sun-burned,
wind-burned, sand-burned, chapped and chaffed, bloody and
soggy.
Her dive suit leaks onto the floor.
JORDAN
See me, sir?
C.O.
You makin' friends with the press,
lieutenant?
He tosses her the paper.
Jordan scans the article as
DeHaven continues over speakerphone:
DEHAVEN
Well, seein's how this thing is out,
you let me handle the r.p.m.
From
this point forward, I want all press
matters coordinated via my office.
I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna
watch Hayes pull flowers out of his
ass and take credit for this one.
Him or the President.
(aside to beautician)
This my shade?
"Midnight Mahogany"?
'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to
lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
C.O.
Your prerogative, Senator.
DEHAVEN
Awright.
How's our girl doin',
anyway?
C.O.
Standing right here in my office.
DEHAVEN
Jordan, dear.
How are they treating
you?
JORDAN
(catching C.O.'s
eyes)
Can't complain, ma'am.
DEHAVEN
Hmmm.
Maybe I'll ask when I see you
in person.
JORDAN
Uh, ma'am.
DEHAVEN
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's
America's cup team in a few weeks --
If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis
O'Conner's days are numbered.
But
they're in San Diego, so I thought
I'd take a quick promenade of the
base.
Deafening silence.
We aren't sure who dreads the idea
more -- the C.O. or Jordan.
C.O.
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements
generally take some time, Senator.
DEHAVEN
"Security"?
What the hell you
talkin' about?
Your base isn't
secure?
C.O.
Of course, but there's more --
DEHAVEN
Then set out the good plates, we'll
all have lunch.
My office will
follow up with details.
Jumping
off, now...
Phone goes dead.
The C.O. gives Jordan a look one might
reserve for a lab technician who inadvertently unleashed
Ebola upon the world.
JORDAN
Sir, I want you to know that I had
nothing to do with any of this.
Not
this article, not --
C.O.
"We'll all have lunch."
Good idea.
Oh, and let's be sure to invite this
sociologist, too -- just in case we
want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME
AFTERWARDS!
YEOMAN
Sir?
Secretary Hayes calling.
The C.O.'s headache becomes a migraine.
JORDAN
(backing out)
Permission to leave, sir?
C.O.
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
SENATE BARBER SHOP - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
DeHaven hands the phone to her aide.
He's set up a
portable office in the next barber chair.
DEHAVEN
Think I overplayed it?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE
Congress and the Pentagon share a
lot of plumbing.
They'll never know
whose leak it is.
BEDROOM - GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT
CAMERA FINDS Navy dress blues laid out on a bed... topcoat
draped on a chair-back... CNN on a television.
CNN COMMENTATOR (TV)
... is denying that it is
considering changing its long-held
policy of exclusion -- but it isn't
denying the presence of at least one
female in a heretofore all-male
program.
Dubbed "G.I. Jane" by the
media, this woman is now undergoing
commando training at the Special
Warfare Command Center in San
Diego...
Half-shaven, Royce leans out of the bathroom in time to
catch...
Footage from Coronado:
A woman in Navy greens is on a
beach run, loaded down with backpack and M-16.
The NEWS
FOOTAGE ZOOMS IN, FREEZE FRAMES with the indelible image
that will be used over and over in coming weeks:
Woman
cradling rifle.
Madonna for the 21st century.
ROYCE
Goddamn.
My poster girl.
CNN COMMENTATOR (TV)
Senator DeHaven's office still has
not released the identity of the
woman, but DeHaven is confirming
that "G.I. Jane" has outlasted many
of her male counter-parts in the
program, said to be one of the most
grueling anywhere.
Joining us now
on "Washington Tonight" for the
feminist perspective is Gloria
Allred, live from --
Royce snaps it off.
He can't take anymore.
BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
Beneath the coffered ceiling of a great Beau-Art hall, one
of Washington's power-tribes is celebrating.
We find
gowned women, tuxedoed men, gold-braided naval officers, a
SWING BAND, and...
Secretary Hayes, newly confirmed.
He beams as he dances
with his wife.
Compliments and friendly barbs come from
all directions:
COMPLIMENTS (O.S.)
Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.
Say
hello to the President for me...
Maybe now you can change that carpet
in your office, Teddy... So what was
the deal you made with DeHaven?
Or
was it the Devil?
Always get them
confused...
HAYES
Didn't you hear?
Effective
immediately, all navy vessels can no
longer be referred to as "she."
BRAYS of laughter.
CUT TO:
BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
Royce, EXCUSING his way through the crowd, fixating on the
bar, leading his DIAL-A-DATE winner by the hand.
Conversations drift into earshot:
VOICE #1
... women are child-bearers.
Life-
givers.
Now we're going to make
them killers?
VOICE #2
... just don't have the upper-body
strength...
VOICE #3
How strong do you need to be to
launch a rocket?
To push a button
or pull a trigger?
Royce can't get away from it.
DIAL-A-DATE
Are we going to dance?
ROYCE
Not right now.
Just yards from the bar, a Pentagon E-RINGER snags Royce's
elbow.
E-RINGER
Commander Royce.
How's life across
the river?
ROYCE
Little slow, sir.
When's the
Pentagon going to send me a good
crisis?
E-RINGER
I'll check my out-basket in the
morning.
Say, do you know...
The E-Ringer turns to make introductions -- but finds his
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS embroiled in the topic du jour:
CIRCLE #1
... but men have trained as athletes
for 5,000 years.
Women have been at
it for, what, couple of decades?
Do
we really know the limits of their
strength?
CIRCLE #2
Or their endurance?
You know, 30
years ago, women marathoners were 90
minutes off the pace of the men.
Now, the women's time is probably
only 20 minutes off.
CIRCLE #1
Try 15.
CIRCLE #3
But what do female soldiers really
contribute?
I mean, why is this
"G.I. Jane" there instead of a man?
Eyes drift to Royce, inviting him into the fray.
ROYCE
(to dial-a-date)
You wait right here.
I'll get the
drinks.
MEZZANINE - BEAU-ART HALL - NIGHT
Heading upstairs with an iceless rum.
Royce finds a calm
and secluded place to get drunk in peace and quiet.
VOICE #1
Take my word for it.
It's just not
going to happen.
Not now, not
anytime soon.
VOICE #2
You're guaranteeing that?
Royce frowns:
He thought he was alone.
He tracks the
voices to a forced-air vent beside the chaise.
VOICE #1
I have it on unorthodox but reliable
authority that combat positions will
remain off-limits.
Despite what's
happening with our Babe in Boyland.
Alarms go off in Royce's head.
He moves quickly to a
railing, looks down.
ROYCE'S POV:
Of two naval officers on the floor below.
They stand beside a matching vent.
It's impossible to see
faces from this angle -- but one man has a distinct bald
spot.
NAVAL OFFICER (VOICE #1)
Well, isn't that what these test
cases are supposed to decide?
(thinking)
Unless, of course, you're suggesting
that "G.I. Jane" is on her way to
becoming "Jane Doe"...
BALD SPOT (VOICE #2)
All I'm saying is that we won't be
integrating -- despite the rhetoric
coming off Capitol Hill, despite
what's happening in Coronado.
And
you did not hear it from me.
NAVAL OFFICER (VOICE #1)
Hear what?
A conspiratorial handshake.
The men split up.
BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
Royce flashes down the stairs.
Hitting main floor, he
looks around and then bumps into...
DIAL-A-DATE
There you are.
Can we please dance
now?
Over her shoulder, Royce spies Bald Spot heading for the
cloak room.
Royce commandeers the nearest J.O.
ROYCE
Lieutenant!
J.O.
Yes sir?
ROYCE
Take a dance!
BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
Royce bobs and weaves through the crowd, trying to keep
sight of...
Bald Spot.
Pushing through the exit doors.
Only steps behind, Royce shoulders through the doors...
WOMEN'S SHOWERS - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Head hung, Jordan showers alone.
THE CHIEF (O.S.)
You know, the Israelis...
Jordan recoils.
Christ, how long has he been there?
Just
standing in the doorway?
THE CHIEF
... they tried women in the 1967
War.
Female soldiers.
With forced calm, Jordan squeaks off the water and finds a
towel.
JORDAN
Permission to get dressed, sir?
THE CHIEF
It seems the men couldn't get used
to the sight of women blown open and
their viscera hanging from tree
limbs.
Israeli men would linger
over wounded females -- often to the
detriment of the mission, often
endangering their own lives.
They
don't use women anymore.
JORDAN
(moving closer)
Sir, someone mentioned you received
the Navy Cross.
May I ask what you
got it for?
THE CHIEF
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a
burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
JORDAN
I see.
So when a man tries to
rescue another man, he's a hero.
But when he tries to rescue a woman,
he's gone soft.
THE CHIEF
Could you have pulled that 210-pound
man clear, lieutenant?
She can't say yes.
She wants to but can't.
THE CHIEF
Females in combat situations impact
unit cohesion.
Men fight better
without women around.
And that is
an historical fact.
JORDAN
It also seems like a problem with
the men's attitude, sir.
So maybe
you should be sniffing around their
shower room instead.
She shoulders past.
The Chief gives her a few steps
before dropping his bomb:
THE CHIEF
England went out with a stress
fracture.
That puts you in charge,
lieutenant.
JORDAN
(off-balance)
McCool's that same rank.
We're both
j.g.'s.
THE CHIEF
You were commissioned one month
earlier, which makes you the senior
officer.
(passing her on his
way out)
Remember.
There are no bad crews --
only bad leaders.
ARTILLERY RANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
Trainees are getting familiar with M-60 machine guns,
firing SHORT BURST at downfield targets.
CORTEZ
(pissed)
No operational experience, and now
she's callin' the shots?
Unbelievable.
SLUTNIK
Suppose she'll wanna eat with us
now...
Jordan overhears them BITCHING.
She steps up to an open
slot -- and proceeds to WAIL AWAY with her M-60, tracer
rounds blazing.
Her target vaporized, she keeps WAILING
madly, taking out Slutnik's target... then Cortez's...
then...
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
O'Neil... O'Neil... O'NEIL!
Finally she stops.
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
One burst, one body, O'Neil!
What
the fuck you trying to do?
Spell
your name?
(to class)
You are not infantry!
Your
firepower is limited!
Excessive
killing only risks compromise...
Reloading, Jordan tosses a look at Slutnik and Cortez.
Ain't nobody bitchin' now.
GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT
ROYCE
(into phone)
I've been trying you for five days.
Don't they give you messages?
JORDAN (V.O.)
It's hard to find time to sleep,
Royce.
Much less keep up with my
phone life.
ROYCE
How hard they making it on you?
HELO - NIGHT
The helo is airborne.
Sitting on rucksacks, trainees
slather their faces with green camouflage paint.
Over the
HOWLING ROTORS:
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Infiltrate... establish your hide-
site... record any movement of
troops, vehicles, patrols -- any
activity inside your scan.
If you
are compromised, you have two
options!
Newberry!
Newberry is the new sixth man.
He's young enough to still
have a hyperactive Adam's apple.
NEWBERRY
Evasive maneuvers or radio for
emergency extraction, sir!
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
If you are extracting, be damn sure
to follow procedures you have
learned in your classroom training!
A helo cannot extract you from a
wooded area!
You must bring it down
in a clearing!
What's the minimum
clearance for an MH-60 Black Hawk,
McCool?
MCCOOL
32 feet, six inches, sir!
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
You will be penalized for early
extraction, but you will be
penalized more for capture -- trust
me, far more!
Survival!
Evasion!
Rescue!
Evacuation!
Welcome to
S.E.R.E.!
HELO - NIGHT
Last out, Jordan is poised to follow when...
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Lieutenant!
Don't back down!
Jordan looks back.
"What the hell does that mean?"
Offering no elaboration, Pyro signals "GO!"
Jordan
springs clear...
HIDE-SITE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
SCOPE POV:
Of the road.
Fast-attack vehicles approach.
MCCOOL
(peering into scope)
Got two FAVs moving south.
I
make... four banditos aboard,
carrying... H-60 machine guns...
Jordan REPEATS THE INFO into a digital tape-recorder, adds
the time.
JORDAN
Newberry, get a photo.
South?
CORTEZ
Entering my scan now...
JORDAN
West?
SLUTNIK
Clear.
JORDAN
North?
FLEA
Clear.
SCOPE POV:
Of the FAVs disappearing down the road.
CORTEZ
FAVs clear.
Everyone relaxes -- as much as six people can in a hole
five feet-wide.
McCool opens up MREs (Meals Ready to Eat)
Slutnik guts his snake.
MCCOOL
You mind?
I'm trying to eat here.
SLUTNIK
So am I.
Cortez finishes pissing into a tin pot.
He transfers the
waste to a zip-lock baggy, offers the pot.
CORTEZ
Anyone?
He looks at Jordan.
She eyes the pot, tempted and nettled
at the same time.
FLEA
Don't wanna evacuate 'cuz someone
came down with uric poisoning, el-
tee.
Abruptly Jordan unzips, drops her pants, sticks the pot
under her.
It raises eyebrows:
It's a far cry from when
she was covering up in cold water.
JORDAN
Didn't even bitch about the seat,
did I?
HIDE-SITE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
MCCOOL
What the... Got an unknown here.
100 yards north-northeast.
They pile up at McCool's scope.
Jordan bulls her way
through.
SCOPE POV:
It's a women.
Dressed in civilian clothes,
she collects firewood.
And she's coming this way.
MCCOOL
She part of the training?
JORDAN
I don't know...
SLUTNIK
"She?"
There's another one?
McCool takes a second look.
SCOPE POV:
Of the women drawing closer... closer... and
finally looking dead-bang at us.
She does an about-face
and walks away.
Quickly.
MCCOOL
Shit.
Think we're had.
CORTEZ
Smoke her.
MCCOOL
I ain't gonna shoot her.
CORTEZ
Only blanks.
Lemme do it.
MCCOOL
(pushing him away)
Hey.
Ain't your call, man.
He looks to Jordan.
JORDAN
Pri One is to protect the mission.
If she represents a real threat, we
have to do it.
Pleased, Cortez slips his rifle under a roof panel.
JORDAN
(to McCool)
But did she see us?
Do you know for
a fact that we are compromised?
McCool doesn't.
Not for sure.
JORDAN
If not, firing will only give away
our position to hostiles in the
area.
Now how smart is that?
MCCOOL
(a beat)
Mighta been civilian.
NEWBERRY
They got regular peeps on this
island, don't they?
HIDE-SITE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
SCOPE POV:
Of the troop carrier braking hard.
"Hostiles"
spill out the rear -- and fan out all around us.
CORTEZ
(at scope)
Banditos on the east perimeter!
150
yards!
Shit, she was part of it!
MCCOOL
Fuck me.
FLEA
What's the word, el-tee?
We're
about one minute from a major take-
down here.
HOLD on Jordan, heart skipping.
Did she really make the
wrong call?
JORDAN
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers.
Drop everything but weapons and the
PRC radio -- we're gonna be high
speed, low drag all the way to the
link-up site.
Ready?
SLUTNIK
Sure.
Now she wants to shoot.
JORDAN
MOVE!
HELO - DAY
PILOT'S POV:
Buzzing treetops, searching.
HELO - DAY
PILOT'S POV:
Yellow smoke rises from the woods.
We swoop
toward it.
HELO - DAY
PILOT'S POV:
Of the action below, growing smaller and
smaller:
Jordan's crew.
Surrounded.
Laying down
weapons.
Captured.
BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - DAY
Hands push Jordan inside the box.
She has to curl up
fetally just to fit.
JORDAN
How long?
(no answer)
Please, HOW LONG?
The LID BANGS closed.
A LOCK RATCHETS, FOOTSTEPS RETREAT.
Daylight sheets in through ventilation slats.
When her eyes adjust, Jordan finds markings on the lid and
walls.
Scratchings made with a nail.
The memoirs of
previous tenants.
JORDAN
"Don't know how much I can take"...
"A little taste of death"... "Save
the nail"...
(then the real kick-
in-the-teeth)
"It's been three days now"...
BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - NIGHT
A BANGING wakes Jordan.
Are they coming for her?
But
FOOTSTEPS LEAVE.
A GROAN from the adjacent box.
JORDAN
Who is it?
WICKWIRE (O.S.)
(a beat)
You know, I had an apartment about
this size once.
JORDAN
Wick.
They got your crew, too?
WICKWIRE (O.S.)
Intagliata was out chasing
breakfast.
They found his tracks.
Well, shit.
A beat.
JORDAN
You really came back for more?
Of
this?
WICKWIRE (O.S.)
When I was sittin' behind a desk in
Washington, it made sense, somehow.
Blame it on my big brother.
He was
Spec-Recon.
And the stories he used
to tell...
JORDAN
If you got a good one, Wick...
Anything to get her mind off this box.
Out of this box.
Now INTERCUT Jordan and Wickwire, lying like fraternal
twins in their wombs of steel:
WICKWIRE
One time he was doing a rekkie of
the Libyan coastline.
This is,
like, right before we bombed
Khadaffi into the past tense.
So
his crew does a nighttime infil,
maps all the big artillery
placements and stuff, then turns
around to get the hell gone.
But
between them and the water are five
Libyan guards, all armed to the
nuts.
JORDAN
They had to kill 'em?
WICKWIRE
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.
But
on every guard's chest,they left one
Marlboro cigarette.
Just a little
calling card to say they'd been
there -- and could come back any
time they wanted.
JORDAN
That's a good story.
WICKWIRE
So the shit you gotta go through?
To get from here to there?
Brother
said it was worth it.
Worth the
training... worth the divorce...
worth anything.
JORDAN
He was married?
WICKWIRE
At first.
JORDAN
You got anybody, Wick?
WICKWIRE
Not me.
You?
It hurts to think about it.
The Potomac.
The gunkhole
harbor.
Royce.
WICKWIRE
O'Neil?
JORDAN
How'd you make it last time, Wick?
How'd you get through this part?
WICKWIRE
(a beat)
Last time I didn't.
JORDAN
(jarred)
Let's keep talkin', Wick.
Just keep
talkin' to me...
CORRIDOR - N.I.C. - DAY
ROYCE
Got time for a brain-pick?
Reading as he walks, a former CIA spook looks up to find
Royce in lockstep.
It surprises him:
Not many people
here talk to him -- unless they're in trouble.
THE SPOOK
is physically unremarkable except for a face that would be
right at home on Easter Island:
This is a man who's seen
most of the world's ills -- and forgotten none.
THE SPOOK
Subject?
ROYCE
O'Neil, Jordan.
THE SPOOK
Thought you two were file-closed.
ROYCE
You knew about us?
THE SPOOK
Sorry.
Thought you knew I knew.
SITUATION ROOM - N.I.C. - DAY
Royce and the Spook enter.
The vault-like door closes
emphatically.
Ensuring their privacy:
ROYCE
Computer -- no transcription, no
com-link, no data-link.
In fact...
shut-down sequence 0-Niner-0-8,
mark.
All around, screens go blank, phone lights extinguish.
They sit at the conference table.
No Computer.
No files.
Just two guys doing headwork.
THE SPOOK
All right.
So who stands to gain if
Jordan flames out in a big way?
ROYCE
The E-Ringers?
Full integration is
gonna cost the services billions at
the worst possible time -- when
Congress is already swinging the
axe.
THE SPOOK
(agreeing)
Congress cuts, military bleeds.
But
Pentagon's a big place.
Let's
narrow the sights.
ROYCE
The Navy?
They've made it clear
they don't want to pull missiles out
of subs to make room for women's
heads.
What's it gonna cost to make
a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
THE SPOOK
Sabotage born of economics?
Wouldn't be a first.
But is Hayes
really going to start his watch with
such a public failure?
ROYCE
Possibly.
Just to spite DeHaven.
THE SPOOK
Hmm.
Let's aim higher.
Royce blinks.
"What's higher?"
THE SPOOK
The White House.
If Jordan wins,
DeHaven wins in spades.
Why?
Well,
it's been said that the only man the
President fears -- ain't no man.
ROYCE
The first female President?
THE SPOOK
Don't for a second think she didn't
leak this story.
"G.I. Jane" gives
DeHaven a symbol that taps into the
biggest constituency of them all.
ROYCE
Women.
THE SPOOK
If you were the President, wouldn't
that put a little piss in your
shoes?
ROYCE
I don't know.
Seems...
THE SPOOK
This ain't about some little soldier
girl sloggin' her way through
commando school.
The implications
go way beyond.
ROYCE
Christ, I don't want to see her take
a fall.
She thinks I do, but...
THE SPOOK
I take it this file is still open.
ROYCE
(shaping his words)
Even tough I don't talk to her every
day -- I still talk to her every
day.
Know what I mean?
THE SPOOK
(nodding)
Okay, so now work it from the other
end.
Think about California -- and
how things might be handled there.
ROYCE
I don't...
(scoffing)
What, someone on base?
A "mole"?
THE SPOOK
This is what you get for brain-
picking an old CIA spook.
but if I
needed to control the outcome of
this test case, that's how I'd do
it.
A man-in-place.
Makes
everything very controllable.
BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - DAY
JORDAN'S POV:
The box opening.
Daylight assaulting us,
blowing out our eyes.
Disembodied hands pulling us out.
INTERROGATION HUT - P.O.W. CAMP - DAY
THE CHIEF
What is your father's name?
Jordan seated.
Prowling the hut is her interrogator.
Her
tormentor.
Her chaperon through Hell.
THE CHIEF
Simple question, lieutenant.
No
reason not to answer.
What is your
father's name?
JORDAN
"Dad."
THE CHIEF
Any brothers?
Sisters?
JORDAN
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
THE CHIEF
Are you hungry?
What's your
favorite food?
We'll try to get it
for you.
JORDAN
Green Eggs and Ham.
You're not
going to get anywhere.
You might as
well put me in the cage.
THE CHIEF
You are in the cage, O'Neil.
Right
here, right now.
JORDAN
Should I be afraid?
THE CHIEF
Right down to your worthless womb,
and I'll tell you why.
This is my
island.
My world.
And here I can
get away with shit that would get me
arrested anywhere else in the world.
Take another scan of my little joy-
boy outside.
If I can do that to a
Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to
you?
Huh?
It makes Jordan think -- and yes, it makes her afraid.
Continuing the psychological strip-search:
THE CHIEF
Why didn't you shoot the woman,
O'Neil?
JORDAN
Wasn't deemed a threat.
THE CHIEF
She led us right to you.
That's no
threat?
Jordan rubs her head.
So long ago.
How did the call come
down?
THE CHIEF
Would you have shot if it was a man?
JORDAN
No.
Yes.
I mean, depends on --
THE CHIEF
The others already told me, O'Neil.
They wanted to shoot, but you
wouldn't let them.
Because you went
soft on another women --
JORDAN
That's not right.
THE CHIEF
That's what your crew said.
Are
they lying?
Or are you?
JORDAN
I think you're the liar.
THE CHIEF
I'm not the one who got five good
men thrown in a bamboo cage.
You
wear the bars, you made the call,
and you got your whole crew --
JORDAN
We didn't know we were compromised.
Firing would only've given away our
position.
THE CHIEF
You think we should go easy on
women, O'Neil?
She stares a beat, knowing it's a loaded question.
THE CHIEF
Do you?
JORDAN
No.
THE CHIEF
I'm so glad we agree.
With stunning ferocity, he grabs her by the neck, pushes
her out the door...
DEHAVEN'S LIMO - DAY
DeHaven snags a BUZZING PHONE.
DEHAVEN
Yes?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)
(anxious)
Did you hear?
DEHAVEN
She made it through S.E.R.E.
training.
Got a call this morning
from --
DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)
Not that.
The White House just
announced that it was sponsoring
legislation that would, in one
stroke, void all remaining elements
of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
The phone suddenly weights a ton, DeHaven dumps it on the
seat beside her.
HOLD on her disbelieving face.
DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)
You there?
Senator?
CORRIDOR - PENTAGON - DAY
Hand-carrying a report, Flag Officer #1 hurries down a
corridor, pushes through a door.
HOLD on the door marker:
"Secretary of the Navy."
SECNAV OFFICE - PENTAGON - DAY
HAYES
Without telling us they do this?
With absolutely no lead time?
At his desk, Hayes scans the report with a deepening
frown.
FLAG OFFICER #1
(to Hayes)
Mr. Secretary, if this bill
passes...
FLAG OFFICER #2
Forget our three-year plan.
They're
rushing the cadence.
We'll be
forced to reorganize the Navy from
top to bottom -- overnight.
HAYES
What the hell is the President
trying to do?
Steal DeHaven's
thunder?
FLAG OFFICER #1
I think it's more important, sir, to
decide what we're going to do --
since it's apparent this issue is
not going away quietly.
HAYES
"G.I. Jane."
And which one of you
told me she wouldn't last a week?
Huh?
The flags squirm.
Shaking his head, Hayes moves to a
window that offers a stunning view of Arlington National
Cemetery.
HAYES
20 years in the Pentagon, I finally
rate an office with a window -- and
it looks out over the world's
largest graveyard.
Think it's a
sign?
CLASSROOM - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
Charts are being passed around the room.
Every trainee
takes one, including Jordan.
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
... underwater detonation devices
employ mechanical timers, and as
such, they are subject to variances
due to water temperature.
That's
why when clearing mines, we always
use two timers.
The charts now
being passed out contain
calculations you must memorize
before...
A MILITARY COP fills the classroom doorway.
Frowning,
Johns joins the cop for a private discussion.
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
O'Neil?
JORDAN
Sir?
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
C.O.'S OUTER OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
Jordan enters.
The yeoman's desk is unattended.
Noticing
the X.O.'s door open, Jordan peers inside to find...
Blondell.
She looks scared out of her mind.
Before she
and Jordan can speak, the yeoman materializes.
YEOMAN
This way, lieutenant.
They're
expecting you.
C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
JORDAN
See me, sir?
The C.O. and X.O. are both here.
C.O.
(uncomfortable)
I don't know of any delicate way to
say this, lieutenant, so I won't
try.
Claims have been made that you
have engaged in fraternization -- of
the same-sex variety.
Specifically,
that you were...
(reading)
"... seen leaving the apartment of
another female officer at such a
time and in such a manner as to
suggest conduct unbecoming."
JORDAN
(a beat,laughing in
relief)
Sir, if someone is suggesting that
I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
The C.O.'s face remains grim.
He isn't relieved.
JORDAN
They're very wrong.
And I'd like to
know where you got this information.
On the C.O.'s nod, the X.O. opens an adjoining office.
Wickwire enters.
He's stiff as a groom on a wedding cake.
WICKWIRE
I'm sorry, O'Neil.
But as class
officer, it's my obligation to
report all violations.
JORDAN
This is insane.
You've got no
proof.
X.O.
(from report)
You were seen leaving Ensign
Blondell's apartment at
approximately 0-200, whereupon
physical affections were exchanged
in public.
JORDAN
We hugged.
X.O.
In addition, you have been seen
frequenting the base exchange, the
mess hall, the --
JORDAN
Because the men didn't want me
eating with them.
Jesus Christ,
let's get this right.
C.O.
That's enough.
Everybody.
(to Wickwire)
Rejoin your class, lieutenant.
WICKWIRE
(only to Jordan)
I wish I didn't have to do this,
Jordan.
C.O.
Dismissed, lieutenant.
Wickwire exits.
JORDAN
Sir, I just want you to know that
this is either a gross mistake --
or someone's vindictive bullshit.
In no way did anything happen
between Ensign Blondell and myself.
We're just friends.
X.O.
So you're saying the charges have no
validity whatsoever?
Jordan opens her mouth to confirm -- and hesitates,
realizing where this might be headed.
What the collateral
damage might be.
JORDAN
I'm saying, we're just friends.
C.O.
I find this as distasteful as you,
lieutenant.
But if it's on my desk,
it's on my shoulders.
There's going
to be an inquiry -- it will not be
quick and it will definitely not be
pretty.
You should prepare
yourself.
JORDAN
Sir, please... if there's any way to
do this without dragging everyone
through the mud...
C.O.
I don't see how, O'Neil.
Dismissed.
Jordan moves to the door.
Again she makes eye-contact
with Blondell.
Now we understand why she's so scared:
There's a witch-hunt brewing.
JORDAN
(turning back)
Sir.
If tomorrow... I was not under
your command... would the inquiry
still go forward?
C.O.
I'm not sure what --
JORDAN
Would you have the discretion to end
it right then and there?
She's offering her own head on a silver platter -- and the
C.O. actually hesitates before answering.
C.O.
I believe so.
COVERED PORCH - JORDAN'S HOUSE - SUNSET
An hour later.
Sharing a quiet moment, Jordan and Royce
cradle tea mugs while sitting on the rear porch that
overlooks the Potomac and a fiery sunset.
JORDAN
All I wanted was an honest chance.
And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't
stay.
ROYCE
And this class officer...
"Wickwire."
You think he was just
trying to get even?
Striking back
for...
JORDAN
Maybe.
Though it didn't seem like
he was getting any satisfaction out
of it.
Almost like...
(a beat)
Did I say he was class officer?
ROYCE
Almost like someone put him up to
it.
Okay, who?
JORDAN
No shortage of suspects.
ROYCE
The Chief?
Or maybe even
Turrentine?
Your C.O.?
She looks at him sidelong.
JORDAN
Royce.
Tell me you didn't keep a
file on me.
LIVING ROOM - JORDAN'S HOUSE - DAY
CLOSE on multiple files being pulled out of a briefcase.
One contains clippings -- "G.I. Jane" photos, editorials,
political cartoons.
Another holds records of Coronado
personnel -- Jordan's crewmates, instructors, the base
brass.
ROYCE
Somebody was yankin' your stings,
Jordan -- maybe from 3,000 miles
away.
I wanted to know who.
I still
do.
She shakes her head, resisting.
ROYCE
C'mon, Jordan.
Do the headwork with
me.
JORDAN
It's done with, Royce.
Let it go.
ROYCE
Someone screwed you over like this,
left unanswered charges hanging over
your head, and you're not gonna
fight back?
JORDAN
I'm tired of fighting back.
I just
wanted to come home and be safe and
have you here and the river there
and just forget the rest of the
world, okay?
ROYCE
Well, before you crawl off to die,
Jordan, give me five minutes of good
headwork.
Agitated, she walks away.
B.G., a PHONE RINGS until the
machine picks up.
ROYCE
(pulling a file)
"John James Urgayle."
The Chief.
JORDAN
What about him.
JORDAN
Instructors typically pull three
year assignments.
This guy's in and
out in one year -- your year.
That
sound right?
JORDAN
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
ROYCE
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a
problem child for the Navy.
JORDAN
I don't know, I don't care.
ROYCE
Well, pardon me if I do.
Now who
else?
Who could've leveraged a
class officer like that?
C'mon,
Jordan, keep your head in the game.
UNDER DIALOG, we hear some of the INCOMING CALL:
DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)
... just got word today.
The
Senator wants you to know that she's
disturbed by the matter, and she'll
be looking into it carefully to make
sure you were treated fairly.
If
you need to reach us, we're here in
Washington, 202-224-3121.
A HANG-UP.
Something stirs in Jordan's memory.
JORDAN
"In Washington..."
ROYCE
What?
JORDAN
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in
Washington between stints at
Coronado...
We can see her mind gathering speed.
Royce switches files
quickly.
ROYCE
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second
run at Coronado... and correct, they
had him stashed in the
"Appropriation Liaison Office,"
whatever that is.
JORDAN
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and
get another shot without
dispensation from someone up in flag
country.
(a revelation)
He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
ROYCE
I'd sure like to know who.
JORDAN
Yeah.
Me too.
ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
Answering a PHONE:
BLONDELL
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
JORDAN (V.O.)
Don't say my name.
BLONDELL
Who's...
(brightening)
Lieuten --
JORDAN (V.O.)
Or rank.
But can you do me a favor
and pull a transfer order?
BLONDELL
Okay, but... You didn't have to do
what you did.
Not for me.
JORDAN (V.O.)
(appreciative)
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."
See what
you can find.
CUT TO:
ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
File in hand, Blondell returns to the phone.
BLONDELL
Got it.
JORDAN (V.O.)
Who signed as his "sponsoring
officer"?
BLONDELL
Uh... don't see it.
There's no
signature.
But hang on -- there's a
note to "See Addendum."
Checking...
She finds a crisp sheet of stationary, out of place among
the smeared government forms.
BLONDELL
Wow...
JORDAN (V.O.)
What'd you find, Kathy?
CLOSE on the stationary.
It bears an image of the Capitol
dome.
MATCH CUT TO:
CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
Jordan and Royce move quickly down a corridor, eyes
hunting, passing CAPITOL GUIDES and their tourists.
Soon
they find...
DeHaven's office.
A Navy captain exits with paperwork.
Hasty salutes.
ROYCE
Capt'n.
NAVY CAPTAIN
Commander.
The captain moves on.
Royce holds in the doorway a beat,
memory nagging him.
Again he looks at...
The captain.
He has a distinct bald spot.
ROYCE
(to Jordan)
Get started here.
I'll catch up.
Picking up where he left off a few weeks ago, Royce
follows Bald Spot around a corner...
PRIVATE STAIRCASE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
... down a private staircase...
ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
... and through a door marked "Naval Appropriation Liaison
Office."
It's not 30 seconds from DeHaven's door.
FOYER - DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
SECRETARY
Your name again?
JORDAN
Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil.
In a side office, DeHaven's aide overhears.
He rises
quickly and enters the foyer.
DEHAVEN'S AIDE
Ms. O'Neil.
Yes, of course.
I'm
Douglas Champeau.
Unfortunately,
the Senator is in chamber right now.
How can I help you?
JORDAN
What chamber?
Which way is that?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE
I mean, she's on the floor of the
Senate.
JORDAN
Okay, which way?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE
She really can't be disturbed.
But
if you care to wait, I'll find you
an office with a phone.
It might be
several hours, but --
A TOURIST pokes in.
TOURIST
'Scuse me, but I'm here to pick up
gallery tickets?
Are you...
DEHAVEN'S AIDE
See the secretary, please.
Over the aide's shoulder, Jordan watches as...
The tourist claims tickets.
HOLD on the bureau near the
secretary's desk where the tickets are stored.
SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
On the chamber floor, SENATORS mull about, consulting
aides, polling party mates.
PAGES place microphones and
fill the ceremonial snuff boxes, readying the room for
session.
Among the activity, we find...
DeHaven.
Caucusing with another Democrat.
JORDAN (O.S.)
Senator DeHaven...
DeHaven looks behind her.
Nobody.
JORDAN
DeHaven...
Now she looks up to behold...
Jordan standing in the gallery.
Staring down on DeHaven
as she is, it's hard to read anything into her expression
but open disdain.
Drawn by Jordan's voice, a CAPITOL GUARD hurries down the
gallery steps.
Royce runs interference.
JORDAN
We can talk here or we can talk
outside, Senator.
You tell me.
On the floor, half the U.S. Senate stops what it's doing
and looks up.
In the gallery, the guard is thrown off-balance by the
naval uniforms:
Do Royce and Jordan belong here or not?
Confused, he looks for guidance from...
DeHaven.
She notes C-SPAN cameras swinging Jordan's way.
Summoning a page:
DEHAVEN
Cloak room.
I'll meet her there.
Just her.
CLOAK ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
Towering doors swing open.
DeHaven appears, face pleasant
but harried.
DEHAVEN
Jordan.
I always hoped we'd get
together -- though just now I'm
gearing up for a child-care vote
that --
JORDAN
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
About to hug Jordan, DeHaven stops awkwardly.
JORDAN
You know him.
DEHAVEN
Sounds familiar.
JORDAN
It should.
You nominated him for
Spec-Recon just three days after you
nominated me.
DEHAVEN
Jordan.
Might we do this over lunch
tomorrow?
I do very much want to
talk, but now is scarcely --
JORDAN
Did you set me up?
Did you set me
up just to see me fail?
DEHAVEN
Absolutely not.
DeHaven glances back at the doors to the Senate chamber --
the open doors.
Walking Jordan a few steps away:
DEHAVEN
Wickwire was there to help.
To be
my eyes on the inside, to make sure
you were getting a fair shot.
At
least that was the intent.
JORDAN
What changed?
DEHAVEN
Should probably ask him that.
JORDAN
If I have to ask again, Senator,
I'll be asking in front of cameras.
It's a threat DeHaven doesn't appreciate.
The Senate
DOORKEEPER appears.
DOORKEEPER
Madam Senator?
Your esteemed
colleagues are requesting --
DEHAVEN
Two seconds, Walter.
(answering Jordan)
In 1981, the Supreme Court was
asked to rule on the issue of women
in combat positions.
The Court
cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws
as a legal foundation for keeping
women ineligible.
That decision
held for all these years -- until
the White House, 10 days ago, moved
to have the Exclusion Laws voided.
To demolish that legal foundation.
JORDAN
So?
Isn't the President jumping on
your bandwagon?
DEHAVEN
What he did was light the bandwagon
on fire.
Because he knows what I
know -- that American families are
not prepared to put their daughters
in harm's way.
JORDAN
You don't know that.
DEHAVEN
In face, I do:
Roper, Harris,
Gallop -- they all come back the
same.
JORDAN
What are you saying?
That a women's
life is more valuable than a man's?
That a women's death hurts a family
more?
DEHAVEN
I'm saying it's not going to happen.
Not when the President is set to
turn this into a third-rail issue
should I choose to ever campaign
against him.
He will fry me six
ways to Sunday for sending daughters
and young mothers off to war -- and,
quite possibly, for bringing them
back in body bags.
Jordan shakes her head in disbelief.
She has met the
enemy -- and she is us.
JORDAN
You were never going to let women
serve in combat.
You always had a
safety net.
Or thought you did.
DEHAVEN
Jordan.
I don't expect you to fully
understand this -- but sometimes
there's more to be gained from the
fight than the victory.
JORDAN
So the rhetoric gets you headlines.
But the reality gets you in trouble.
DEHAVEN
The reality is this:
We send far
too many men off to war.
I don't
need to compound the problem with
women.
(off Jordan's look)
Can you honestly tell me you wanted
that life?
Squat-pissing in some
third-world jungle with --
JORDAN
I wanted the choice.
The chance to
prove myself, my skills, my work,
me.
That's how it should've been.
DOORKEEPER
Madam Senator, once again I must --
DEHAVEN
Just hold the goddamn clock, Walter.
Not happy about it, the doorkeeper reaches into an alcove,
grabs a broom he keeps around for just these occasions.
He enters the chamber...
SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
... and moves behind the rostrum.
Holding the broom by
the bristles, the doorkeeper stands on tip-toes...
And uses the broom handle to turn back the Senate clock by
three minutes.
Senators GROAN.
It's an old trick played by senior
members -- and they all hate it when it happens to them.
CLOAK ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
DEHAVEN
I once promised you a fast ticket,
Jordan, and I always meant to make
good on that.
Come work for me.
I
can always use a hard-charger on my
team.
JORDAN
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket,
too?
DEHAVEN
I've had no direct communication
with him since this whole thing
began.
And that's quite verifiable.
JORDAN
I'm sure it is.
DEHAVEN
You'll think about my offer?
JORDAN
You know, I wonder what the SecNav
would think about it.
If I spoke
with him.
DEHAVEN
Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this
morning myself -- and told him the
deal was off.
No more test cases.
He was only too happy to oblige.
(dangerously low)
Don't play politics with me, little
darlin'.
You'd be up way past your
bedtime.
DOORKEEPER
(distraught)
Madam Senator, please...
DEHAVEN
I'll call you in a few days.
She flashes a winning smile and turns away.
As the
chamber doors start to close behind her:
JORDAN
So I wonder what the President would
think.
The last image we have of DeHaven is her whirling back,
startled.
The DOORS BOOM CLOSED in her face.
C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
The C.O. hangs up and looks to Jordan, heretofore unseen.
She waits anxiously.
C.O.
Well, if you had to go over my
head, lieutenant, that's the way to
do it.
Christ, nothin' like a 0-200
call from the Commander and Chief to
get the bowels movin'.
JORDAN
Sir?
What did he say?
C.O.
Basically -- he asked me if I could
unring a bell.
HELO - DAY
THE CHIEF
(setting watch)
Four... three... two... one... hack!
Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry, Jordan.
Inside
the airborne helo, they synchronize their dive watches.
THE CHIEF
Final assignment!
Each crew will be
dropped 12 miles out!
Between you
and the shore is a network of mines
and underwater obstacles!
You will
clear the obstacles, you will tag
the mines with your crew number!
You have until 18-hundred to make
landfall!
HELO - DAY
The trainees double-check wet gear and survival vests.
On
Jordan's nod, they push an inflatable life boat ("ILB") to
the helo door.
It's rolled up into a rubber log.
THE CHIEF
Remember!
The one thing you can
count on in any mission is that
anything mechanical will fail!
If
you get stuck out here, do not call
me, for you will no longer be in my
class!
Try the Coast Guard!
The HELO PILOT slows to five knots.
The Chief gives
Jordan the go-ahead nod.
JORDAN
(to her crew)
One-second intervals!
Go!
HELO - DAY
The helo turns into the morning sun.
PILOT and CO-PILOT
drop visors.
PILOT'S POV:
Of dots in the sun.
What the hell are try?
SMACK!
Something hits the windscreen, splattering red and
brown.
THE CHIEF
What happening?!
PILOT
Fucking pelicans!
Hang on!
He starts to bank clear -- but not fast enough.
HELO - DAY
A SHARP BANG... a WICKED SHIMMY... and now they whole helo
loses power.
PILOT
Holy... LET'S GYRATE!
As the pilot wrestles controls, the co-pilot rigs for
auto-gyration.
But the bank they started is working
against them:
The helo is coming down badly, circling
like a huge steel feather.
Braced, the Chief looks out the side door -- and sees
ocean rushing up at him.
Fast.
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
Wedged into a tortured maze of hydraulics and equipment,
we find the Chief, operating out of an air-pocket near the
windscreen.
The pilot is dead, impaled on his cyclic
stick, head submerged.
The co-pilot is still alive,
barely.
The Chief struggles to keep the man's head up as
he keys a survival radio.
THE CHIEF
Got one other heartbeat here, looks
touch and go.
I've got a
questionable leg.
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
The Chief sizes up his air pocket.
THE CHIEF
(into radio)
That... may not be adequate.
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
THE CHIEF
(into radio)
This mission wasn't about tagging
mines.
It was to see how you coped
with mechanical failures.
Pretty
fuckin' ironic, huh?
He laughs.
It's the bleakest laugh imaginable.
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
Swimming in his own blood, the Chief starts to fade away,
losing consciousness.
But then, through the cockpit
windscreen...
A hazy orb of light above him.
The orb grows and grows
until it resolves into a flare carried by his would-be
savior.
Jordan.
THE CHIEF
Why'd it have to be her...
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
... and surface inside the wreckage.
JORDAN
Chief, sir... still with me?
CHIEF
(unbuckling co-pilot)
Take him first.
Once he's clear,
come back with --
JORDAN
Sir, let me suggest you stop giving
orders and start doing exactly what
I say, because that's the only way
we're all getting out of here.
Now
how's your vest check out?
Still
good?
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
JORDAN
Flea, take the pilot up slow, feed
him air.
Chief, sir, you and I are
gonna take the express elevator
outta here.
Remember to let your
air out.
Ready?
