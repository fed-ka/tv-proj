      A strange, rhythmic PULSING rises over a barren section of 
      woods on the outskirts of Beacon Hills. 

      Feet pounding across the arid ground, a TEENAGE BOY runs 
      blindly through the darkness, almost like he s trying to 
      outrun the sound. But he stumbles on an exposed tree root and 
      CRASHES to the ground.

      A cloud of dust settles to reveal the boy kneeling, hands 
      held to his ears--FIFTEEN YEAR-OLD DEREK HALE. He peers up to 
      focus on the source of his pain-- 

      A Hunter s ULTRASONIC EMITTER stuck in the ground.

      GUNSHOTS ring out behind him. Rising up, Derek charges off 
      again. But another EMITTER piercing the side of a tree pushes 
      him in the opposite direction.

      Everywhere he turns, another Emitter and its intolerable 
      SCREECHING propels him in a new direction, pushing him, 
      corralling him.


      Racing into a clearing, Derek SLAMS into another YOUNG MAN. 
      They whirl about to face each other. The Young Man s eyes 
      GLOW, causing Derek s eyes to brighten in response, surging a 
      brilliant YELLOW.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    You re a Hale. Aren t you?

      Before Derek can respond, an ARROW pierces the Young Man s 
      throat. His mouth opens in shock. Derek stares in horror as 
      the Young Man collapses.  As he hits the ground, the glow 
      recedes from his eyes.

      Hearing a MECHANICAL CLICK, the sound of a weapon reloading, 
      Derek spins around.

      A HUNTER steps out of the darkness, raising a massive 
      CROSSBOW and aiming it right at the fifteen year-old boy.                                TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/132.

      He FIRES. But a HAND snatches the arrow right out of the air. 
      A young PETER HALE snarls in response, fangs bared, and snaps 
      the arrow in half.

      The Hunter drops the crossbow and a GUN appears almost 
      instantly in his hand.

      Peter grabs the still stunned Derek and drags him into the 
      darkness as GUNFIRE blasts through the night.

      Black boots kicking up dust, SEVERAL OTHER HUNTERS rush out 
      of the shadows to surround the body of the Young Man. Gerard 
      Argent gives it a glance and looks to his son, Chris.

                                  GERARD
                    Is this the one?

                                  ARGENT
                          (nodding)
                    Killed two of ours.

      Argent turns to the gathered Hunters.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    Find the others. Bring them back 
                    alive.

      Noticing one Hunter sneer at the suggestion, Argent levels a 
      cold gaze on him.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    Alive. We go by the code.

      The wind carries his voice up into the trees and over the 
      Hunters as they fan out, FLASHLIGHT BEAMS cutting through the 
      dark and passing by--

      A GROVE OF TREES. Their powerful branches reach out 
      impossibly far while below, brush and leaves conceal a secret 
      entrance...


      Hurrying out of the fallow woods, Derek guides Paige toward a 
      barn-like steel structure.

                                  PETER (V.O.)
                    Their favorite dark corner was an 
                    empty distillery outside of Beacon 
                    Hills.

      Inside, Derek pulls Paige close, his lips to hers.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    All right, hold up.


      Through a HOLE in the corrugated steel wall of the 
      distillery, Peter secretly watches Derek and Paige as they 
      kiss. He looks on them more with curiosity than jealousy. 
      Until Paige pauses, gently pulling away from Derek.

                                  DEREK
                    What?

                                  PAIGE
                    Why do you like me?

                                  PAIGE
                    Honestly? I think, at first, you 
                    liked me because I didn t like you.

                                  DEREK
                    So are you worried that now that I 
                    know you like me, I m going to stop 
                    liking you?

                                  PAIGE
                    Not worried. Just wondering when.

                                  DEREK
                    What if I never stop liking you?

      He draws her back into his arms, but then glances up, 
      attention grabbed.

                                  PAIGE
                    What? Did you hear something?

                                  DEREK
                          (confused)
                    It sounded like someone gagging.

      Peter whips back from the hole in the wall as Derek turns 
      toward him. Keeping still for a moment, he carefully peers 
      back into the distillery.

      Derek now stands in front of Paige, scanning the other side 
      of the building s interior.

                                  PAIGE
                    What s wrong?

                                  DEREK
                    Something happened here.

                                  PAIGE
                    What do you mean?

                                  DEREK
                    I caught a scent. Blood.

      He takes her hand, guiding her closer to him. Then snaps his 
      eyes to the doors.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Now I definitely heard something.

      Outside, Peter cocks his head, focusing on a far off sound 
      Paige would never be able to hear. FOOTSTEPS. People 
      approaching fast.                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1314.

                                  PAIGE
                    Derek, I don t hear any--

                                  DEREK
                    We have to go.

      He grabs her hand, pulling her out and into a run. Peter 
      retreats from the side of the building, glancing nervously 
      about.

      IN THE DISTANCE, shadowy figures appear, approaching fast.

      Hurrying around the corner of the building, Peter crouches in 
      the darkness. Back to the wall, he listens to the rush of 
      people, a dozen or more filling the inside of the distillery.

      Through a crack in the wall, a familiar face arrives--Ennis. 
      Leading the group, he points to the ceiling.

                                  ENNIS
                    There. You see it?

      A ROPE dangles from above, BLOOD staining the lower end. A 
      crowd of werewolves gather underneath, powerful men and women 
      grouped with their respective packs.

                                  ENNIS (CONT D)
                    They dragged him here, an arrow in 
                    his throat. They hung him and cut 
                    him in half. They killed one of 
                    ours.

                                  KALI
                    One of yours.

      Standing with her own pack, Kali faces Ennis.

                                  KALI (CONT D)
                    You can t say your plea for 
                      solidarity doesn t come with 
                      convenient timing. Why should I 
                    care about one of your pack?

                                  LAURA
                    Because the Hunters don t discern 
                    packs.

      LAURA HALE, a strong young woman with the voice of a rising 
      leader, steps out from the others.

                    But they do discern motive.

      His back to the others, Deucalion gazes up at the bloody rope 
      above. Then turns to look on them with perfectly normal and 
        surprisingly gentle BLUE EYES.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    Ennis, why did they kill him?

      Ennis doesn t answer, standing firm with his pack. One of 
      Deucalion s Betas, MARCO, steps forward.

                                  MARCO
                    Because your young, naive Beta 
                    killed one of them.

                    Marco--

      Deucalion tries to ease him back.

                                  MARCO
                    He killed a Hunter. Didn t he? 

                                  ENNIS
                      Accidentally.

      Murmurs of dissent rumble through the crowd.

                                  GERARD (V.O.)
                    They were all there. Deucalion, 
                    Kali, Ennis. Each of them with 
                    their packs before they d killed 
                    them all and decided to form their 
                    little all-star team.


      Through a gap in the steel wall, Peter watches his older 
      sister, Talia, try to maintain the peace among the wolves.   

                                  TALIA
                    It s his right. And we re hardly 
                    the only people who adhere to 
                    rituals thousands of years old.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Which is no excuse for not 
                    evolving.

      Ennis holds up a CLAWED HAND.

                                  ENNIS
                    They ripped his claws right out of 
                    his fingers. They desecrated his 
                    body. You call that evolving? 
                    What s their excuse?

      Peter leans closer to listen as--A HAND YANKS HIM TO HIS 
      FEET. He spins to face Laura.

                                  PETER
                    What the hell are you doing?

                    Me? You re the one lurking in the 
                    shadows all of the time.

      He yanks free of her.

                                  PETER
                    Try to remember I m your uncle.

      She starts to respond but they both glance back when Ennis 
      ROARS in fury, silencing the voices inside.

                                  ENNIS
                    Useless debate. I m done with it.

      Now both Laura and Peter peer through the gaps to watch Ennis 
      approach the far wall of the distillery. He places the tips 
      of his claws against the corrugated steel.

                                  DEUCALION

                    Don t make us part of a historical 
                    clich . With two such powers it 
                    never stops at an eye for an eye. 
                    Revenge becomes a blood feud. A

                    becomes a massacre. And we become 
                    no better than our enemies.

      Ennis holds a moment longer. But then he TEARS through the 
      steel with his claws, hand arcing around, sending SPARKS 
      FLYING. Finally, he steps back, walking away to reveal the 
      image carved into the wall.

      A SPIRAL.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      Amid students eating lunch at the outdoor tables, Derek 
      barely pays attention to his friends. He keeps glancing at 
      Paige who eats at a table alone while doing homework. Derek 
      doesn t seem to notice most of his friends leaving the table. 
      Or Peter sitting down.

                                  PETER
                    Why does she eat alone?

      He sifts through Derek s food for something to eat. Finds a 
      package of candy.

                    A few. But she likes studying 
                    during lunch. And I kind of don t 
                    think she likes my friends.

                                  PETER
                    No one should like your friends. 
                    They re a bunch of hormonal

      Biting into the candy, Peter nods to Paige.

                    But that one over there. She s

      He grabs his bag, starting to get up.

                                  PETER
                    It would worry me too, though. I d 
                    probably be thinking about it all

                    god, what are you? Don t touch me. 
                    Stay away from me.

                                  DEREK
                    She wouldn t be like that. And she 
                    doesn t have to find out.

                                  PETER
                    But they always do. Especially when 
                    they re perfect for you. There s 
                    really only one way to make sure 
                    you ll always be together.

      Derek looks at him, waiting for the answer he already knows.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Turn her.

      Fingers digging into the arid dirt outside the distillery, 
      Deucalion uses every bit of strength he has to crawl his way 
      to safety.

      But Gerard calmly walks out, two FLASHBOLT ARROWS in his 
      hands. Deucalion twists about to face him.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Don t. Don t do this. I had a 
                    vision--I had a vision of peace.

                                  GERARD
                    A little short-sighted, I would 
                    say.

      Gerard STABS the arrows into Deucalion s eyes. They FLARE on 
      impact. As Deucalion SHRIEKS in agony, Gerard steps away to 
      watch the FLASHBOLT FLAMES consume his eyes.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
