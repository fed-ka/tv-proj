                               ALFRED

               This may sound foolish, Master Dick, but

               I'm concerned about Master Bruce.  He's

               disappeared.

                               DICK

               He sometimes goes undercover for days,

               Alfred.  You know that.


                               ALFRED (V.O.)

               Quite true, sir.  But he told me last

               night that he would be back before

               morning --

TO:




Looking rather concerned.

He sits up, now looking serious.

TO:




Alfred opens the door and Dick ENTERS.


                               ALFRED

               Thank you for coming, Master Dick.  I'm

               probably foolish for worrying, but --



                                                                                                  Page 5 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/Midnight.html                                                                                                3/10/03 7:25 PMUntitled

                               DICK

               Don't sweat it, Alfred.

                       (beat)

               What sort of case was he working on?




They cross to the bookcase, passinga clock which tells us it's

8:05. Alfred removes a book, triggeringthe release mechanism.  

During this:


                               ALFRED

               I'm not sure, really.  He said little

               about this one.  You know how he gets

               sometimes ...


The bookshelf opens, revealing thestairs leading down into 

darkness.


ON DICK


He looks serious; a little tight-lipped.Bruce's reticence has 

always been hard for him to deal with.


                               DICK

               Yeah.  I know.

                                                              CUT 

TO:




ROBIN has his costume on; he buckleshis utility belt while Alfred 

looks on.


                               ALFRED

               Something to do with the city's drug

               trade, I believe.  He mentioned the

               warehouse district, south of Pasko

               Place -- is that any help?


FAVOR ROBIN


Who looks grim.


                               ROBIN


                                                                                                  Page 6 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/Midnight.html                                                                                                3/10/03 7:25 PMUntitled

               It's a start.


He moves O.S.




Robin throws a leg over a Batcycle,picks up the helmet.


                               ROBIN

               I hope I'm doing the right thing.

               Don't want to mess up Bruce's case by

               poking my nose in it.


                               ALFRED

               I understand your reticence, but I have

               a bad feeling about this.  I think he

               needs your help.


CLOSE ON ROBIN


Somewhat sad.


                               ROBIN

               He doesn't need my help, Alfred.  He

               doesn't need anybody's.

                       (beat)

               He never has.


ANOTHER ANGLE


Alfred approaches from behind, putsa hand on Robin's shoulder.


                               ALFRED

               If anyone knows him, lad, you do.  If

               anyone can find him, you can.


ANGLE INCLUDES RAMP


Robin puts on the helmet and ROARSup the ramp.  Alfred watches him 

go, worry etching his face.


                                                           CUT TO:




Robin is bent over a work bench, dustingthe vial for prints.  

Alfred watches.  Robin straightens up indisappointment.


                               ROBIN

               Nothing.

                       (beat)

               Batman never does anything without a

               purpose.  This has got to mean something.


                               ALFRED

               Perhaps a reference to one of your

               previous cases.


                               ROBIN

               Exactly what I was thinking.


ANGLE INCLUDES TROPHY AREA


Robin and Alfred are facing the trophyarea of the Batcave; we can 

see the giant penny, the robot dinosaur andthe Joker card 

suspended from the cave's ceiling. (Other trophies mightinclude 

the Bat-duplicant from His Silicon Soul, the Mad Hatter'sdream 

helmet from  ToDreamNightof, the katana sword fromPerchance the 

 ... director's choice, so long as the Joker card is prominentNinja

in shot.)  Robin steps forward, looking at the trophies.


                                                                                                  Page 9 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/Midnight.html                                                                                                3/10/03 7:25 PMUntitled

                               ROBIN

               But which one?  We've worked together

               on hundreds of cases.


ANGLE FAVORS JOKER'S CARD


The mocking mountebank's face leersdown at them.  Robin looks up 

at it.


                                                           CUT TO:




Dark, brooding, Lovecraftian; it makesBedlam look like Bauhaus.  

In the high vaulted ceiling a leaded skylightis pried open with a 

CREAK. Robin's silhouette appears against the moon. He drops 

lithely down.


ANOTHER ANGLE


Robin sneaks down the corridor, movingfrom one pool of light to 

the  next.  We can hear the crepuscularMUTTERINGS of inmates in 

their cells, barely audible: The black-body radiationof madness.


                               INMATES

                       (whispers, mutters,

                        occasional laughter)


ANGLE INCLUDES JOKER'S CELL


It's dark in the glass-fronted cell. Robin approaches cautiously.


CLOSER


He extends a hand, is about to touchthe glass when:


                               JOKER (O.S.)

                       (sharply)

ANGLE ON JOKER


The JOKER leans forward into the dimlight, his sadistic grin 

eerily half-lit.  He's wearing loose whitehospital garb and a 

heavy-duty straitjacket.  The cell is stark, monastic. The Joker 

does not seem surprised to see Robin there.


                               JOKER (CONT'D)

               It's not much, but it's the only

               view I have.


                               ROBIN

               I'm looking for Batman.


ANOTHER ANGLE - JOKER


Eyes lidded, unnervingly still.


                               JOKER

               Aren't we all.

                       (chuckles; then, mock-

                        surprise)

               Don't tell me you think I know where

               he is?  After all, I'm just a poor

               lunatic locked away in an asylum.


ON ROBIN


In no mood for this.  He leansforward angrily.


                               ROBIN

               Stow it, Joker.  Batman's missing.  He

               left this as a clue.


He holds up the vial of acid.


                               ROBIN (CONT'D)

               Acid.  The same kind of acid you

               sometimes use in your lapel flower.

               Admit it -- you're involved in this

               somehow.


ON JOKER


He looks crushed.


                                                                                                  Page 11 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/Midnight.html                                                                                                3/10/03 7:25 PMUntitled


                               JOKER

                       (sniffs)

               You wound me, boy.  I assure you, I am

               as pure as the driven snow.


ON ROBIN


His confidence in the Joker's involvementis slightly shaken.


                               ROBIN

               So you don't know where he is?


ON JOKER


He smiles a smile of pure evil.


                               JOKER

               Oh, I didn't say that .


ON ROBIN


HE POUNDS both fists against the glasswall of the Joker's cell.


                               ROBIN

               Tell me!  Or I'll --

ON JOKER


Not at all disturbed by Robin's anger.


                               JOKER

               You'll what?  Send me to Arkham?

                       (cackles)

               Oh no, no, it won't be that easy.  The

               clock's ticking, boy.  You've got less

               than three hours.


ON ROBIN


He shoots his cuff back, looks at hiswatch.  It reads .9:15

               It's not easy living up to his ideals,

Robin is pacing, looking very distraught. Alfred isn't much 

happier.


                               ROBIN

               Nothing at Gotham Cemetery either.

               The Joker was jiving me.  I wouldn't

               be surprised if he sicced those

               graverobbers on me.


                               ALFRED

               Do you think he was lying about the

               No.  That I believe.

               He was right about something else, too.

               If I'm going to find Bruce, I have think

               like Batman.

               much as I admire Bruce, I've never

               wanted to be like him.  So grim, so

               driven ...


Alfred ENTERS SHOT, puts a hand onRobin's shoulder.

ANOTHER ANGLE


Robin clenches a fist in determination.


                               ROBIN

He heads O.S.  Alfred follows.




Robin pushes Skates up against thewall.

One of the seedier subway stationsin Gotham, which is saying 

something.  Graffiti is crusted like coralon the walls and 

pillars. Trash is everywhere.  A derelict huddlesin a corner 

against the cold; he looks up as Robin dashes past him anddown the 

stairs to the lower level.




Narrow corridors veined with electricalconduits, circuit boxes, 

water pipes.  Robin runs THROUGH SHOT.




Dimly lit by bare hanging bulbs. Rats CHITTER and scurry about.  

Robin stops, unsure which way to go.

A gun barrel suddenly EXTENDS INTOSHOT next to his head.

               The place where they keep the old

The Thug drops like a poleaxed steer.  Robin dashes O.S.




Robin crawls through it on his handsand knees.  There's light up 

ahead; he crawls toward it.

A small grid in the wall where thecorridor makes a 90  turn.  

Robin worms his way up to it, peersthrough it.
