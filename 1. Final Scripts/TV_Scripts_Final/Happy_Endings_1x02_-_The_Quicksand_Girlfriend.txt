Brad and Max sit in a booth.  They watch Dave, who 
animatedly talks to a HOT GIRL (FEDORA/LAME clothes) at the 
bar.  She laughs.  It seems to be going well. 

MAX
Look at our cute little guy, making 
friends.   *

BRAD
Bet ya five bucks he tells her about 
the time he raced across Michigan 
Avenue to save that puppy.

MAX
 going with his story No way.  He s
about when he returned that fumble 
for a touchdown junior year.

Dave pretends to weave in and out of what looks to be 
football players.

MAX
Boom.  Fumble-aya.  Pay me!

Brad goes to give Max cash.  But then they see Dave miming 
picking something up which he seems to be cradling.

BRAD
Hold up -- that s a puppy.

Brad snatches back the cash.  Then, Dave mimes SPIKING 
whatever was in his hand.  Brad and Max react.

MAX
 hope that was a football, or Let s
we did not get the full version of 
that puppy story.

Dave approaches the booth.

BRAD

Why do people feel the need to 
express themselves by touching?*

BRAD

easier to find these stackables if 
they were in the shelving section?

But I feel like I should at least 
call her and say thanks, right?

MAX
Wrong!  That breaks all the rules of 
the one-night stand.  

PENNY
Yeah, the most I get is a text.  
Although, last week I did get a shout-
out on a guy s Twitter.  And Lil  *
Wayne follows him, so, fingers 
crossed for a re-tweet!   

DAVE
Man, things changed since I ve been 
out of the game.

I just don t wanna be a bad guy, you *
know?  She s at work, I ll just *
leave her a message--

Oh, hey Andrea... Undrea, right.  I 
just wanted to say I had a great 
time last night and... breakfast?

Max, Brad and Penny are all asleep.  Dave enters and slams 
the door, jolting them awake.  He looks frazzled.  

PENNY
Dave, where have you been?  

DAVE
It s all a blur.  We went to get 
crepes, which led to a walk by the 
lake, and then we went to look for a 
book on dreams -- by the way Pen, *
that nightmare where you re playing 
frisbee underwater is totally about 
your fear of marrying a bald guy--Happy Endings  "The Quicksand Girlfriend" [104]      8.

dance videos -- apparently she s 
trying out for Ke$ha s European tour *
-- we ate again, and then somehow *
ended up at the Field Museum where 
she talked me into buying a two year 
joint membership because you get 
free parking!

MAX
Dude, that s insane.  There s a ton *
of street parking by the Field *
Museum.  *

BRAD
Dave, you are stuck in chicksand.

MAX
Okay, that s not a thing.  

BRAD
Yeah, it s  quicksand  but I 
replaced the  quick  with  chick. 

MAX
You re better than that.*

DAVE*
What do I do?*

PENNY
Dave, if you don t wanna see her *
again, just be an adult and tell her *
that.  Have the conversation.  *

BRAD*MAX*
(scoff-laughing)*(scoff-laughing)*
Yeah right.  *The conversation sucks.  **

Alex (with application) stands with SAMANTHA at the door.  

ALEX
Okay, final question if we re gonna *
live together.  Leggings? 

SAMANTHA
Never.  But jeggings on a fall 
weekend, bolero jacket and a Cuban 
heel, think about it.

ALEX
I.  Love you.

They laugh.  Just then, Max, Penny, Brad and Jane enter.

she might be my new roommate.

ALEX
Doesn t she seem great? 

JANE
Sure, she seems great, but did you 
get her social security number to 
run a credit check?  What about 
references?  And how much money does 
she make?  I mean, what do you 
really know about her? 

ALEX

She likes vampire books and Beyonc .

don t you find someone fun.  Like a 
fighter pilot, or Scottie Pippen.

PENNY
Ooh -- no Al, you should get a real 
gay guy.  
(off Max s look)
You re basically a straight dude who 
likes dudes.  I want someone who ll 
watch house flipping shows with me 
and grab my boobs in a platonic way.    

MAX
So... you want a flamboyant cartoon 
stereotype Sex and the City gay?  
That s offensive.

PENNY

wants.

ALEX
Guys, we re talking about my 
roommate here.  *

JANE
(looking at paper)
Well your roommate Samantha has had 
six jobs in six years.  Seems 
flighty.  What happens if she can t 
make rent?  Or if she kills you?  

ALEX
Okay, you re being paranoid.  Of 
course she s gonna make rent.    

JANE
Am I?  Because you ve only ever 
lived with me and Dave.  A lot goes 
into making this decision.  

ALEX
Well, I guess I didn t totally think 
about that.  

JANE
But I did.  And judging people comes 
so easy for me.  Which is why you 
should really let me help you.*Happy Endings  "The Quicksand Girlfriend" [104]      11.

Jane follows a busy Alex around with pictures of different 
PROSPECTIVE ROOMMATES in a binder.

JANE
I ve got some real accomplished 
roommate candidates, like Becca.  
She s a marine biologist and a 
notary public.  She can teach you 
about plankton and also witness the 
signing of important documents.  

ALEX
Sounds super fun.  Jane, I can t do *
this right now.  *

Jane and Alex exit towards the back of the store.  Penny 
comes out of the dressing room, wearing a new dress.  

PENNY
What do you guys think of this one-- 
(realizing they are gone)
--and no one cares.  

Max enters with DERRICK (well put together, flamboyant).  

DERRICK
Oh my god, that dress is dee-lish!  
Things that make you go hmmm.

PENNY
Gracias.  Max, who is this fine man?

MAX
This is Derrick.  I thought you guys 
might get along.  We played on a gay 
softball team together last year.

Andrea.  Two days ago.

Just then Andrea and Dave PULL UP IN HER CAR.  Dave (in a 
fedora) gets out, but Andrea pulls him in for a LONG KISS.  
Max and Brad watch in awkward silence.  Brad whispers:

Well, you didn t get back to me on

best roommate candidates and invited 
them over for a little open house.

All right, it s time to step it up a 
notch.  You need to make it clear to 
her very quickly that you are not 
boyfriend material at all.  

DAVE
But I am awesome boyfriend material.  
I like cuddling, and giving foot 
rubs, and listening to long stupid 
stories about who sat next to who at 
yoga.  I m in trouble.    

BRAD
No you re not.  Do what I say, and 
by the end of one horrible date,

JANE*
I don t need to do that.  I mean, I *
