      A STONE MEMORIAL and flagpoles flying Old Glory and the 
      California Bear are the focal points of a fenced half-acre 
      patch of grass and trees and neat flowerbeds at the center of 
      San Angelo, an old farming town.  The usually quiet park is a 
      hive of activity -- POLICEMEN, CSI TECHS, NEWS CREWS, GAWKERS 
      behind yellow tape; that whole scene.  All revolving around a 
      crime scene that is, so far, just out of our view.    

      RIGSBY and CHO are waiting at the park entrance. 

                                  RIGSBY
                          (grumpy)
                    Any place.  Suspect can leave the 
                    body any place.  And they dump it 
                    on the only state land within a 
                    hundred miles.  Making it ours.

                                  CHO
                    Why is that a bad thing? 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Come on.  You saw the body.

                                  CHO
                    It's a coincidence.

                                  RIGSBY
                    If there's one thing Jane's taught 
                    me...

      He stops because JANE and LISBON and VAN PELT approach.

                                  LISBON
                    Hi.  What have we got?

      They walk and talk toward the crime scene.

                                  CHO
                    Victim's name is Emma Plaskett.  
                    Nineteen.  Local girl.  First 
                    responder knew her from high 
                    school.  

      He points out an ASHEN YOUNG DEPUTY sitting on the hood of a 
      Sheriff's Department Cruiser.

                    Lives at home with her parents, has 
                    an older brother and a twin sister, 
                    Maya, who went missing at the same 
                    time last night.

      The others react.  Oh crap.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Their car was found abandoned on 
                    the roadside last night.  Ten miles 
                    north of here.

                                  LISBON
                    Who's coordinating search teams

                    Sheriff Hardy here is in charge. 

      This last as they come up on SHERIFF HARDY (30's), who is 
      gazing sadly at the crime scene, chewing gum.

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    Hi.  Ed Hardy.  Good to meetcha.   

      He puts out his hand to Lisbon.

                                  LISBON
                    Lisbon, Van Pelt, Jane.

      Hardy nods politely to them.  Jane goes to look at the body.

                                    SHERIFF HARDY 
                    I've called in all my people and 
                    we've got volunteers rendezvousing 
                    at the football field.  We'll grid 
                    up and have 'em in the field 
                    shortly.  

      We see Jane react strongly, but we don't see the body.

                                  JANE
                    Lisbon.  Look.

      She senses the urgency in his voice, and does as he asks.  
      POV -- a quick impressionistic look at the body.  

                                  LISBON
                    Oh damn.

                                  JANE
                    Yes.

                    No.  It's a coincidence.

                                  CHO
                    That's what I said.

                                  JANE
                    There's no such thing as 
                      coincidences.  Not with him. 

      Rigsby looks to Cho -- exactly.

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    What are you all talking about?  
                    Who's him?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Red John.  He's a serial killer.  
                    This is his style of, of cutting.

                                  CHO
                    The rest of his MO is absent.  Red 
                    John works indoors.  He doesn't 
                    move the body post mortem.  And 
                    where's the smiley face?  

                                  VAN PELT
                    It's a trademark.  He wouldn't drop 
                    that.

      Jane and Lisbon step aside, so that Sheriff Hardy doesn't 
      hear.  Made easier by the DRONE OF A PLANE in the sky 
      overhead.

                                  JANE
                    It's him.  Look at her toenails.

                                  LISBON
                    I see them.

                                  JANE
                    Painted with her blood.  Just like 
                    my wife.  This is Red John, and he 
                    wanted to make sure I'd be on the 
                    case.  

                                  LISBON
                    Look, it's strange.  I'll give you 
                    that.  But you're jumping to 
                      conclusions.  There's no way to 
                    tell for sure who...

      One by one, Van Pelt, Cho, Rigsby and Hardy all look up at 
      the sky.  Lisbon and Jane see this and look up also.  

      POV -- In the clear blue sky, a LIGHT PLANE IS SKYWRITING, 
      with smoke, finishing up a wide circle, and then creating two 
      dots for eyes.  Jane and the CBI team are silenced.  Holy

      The little PLANE DRAWS the curve of a smile, five hundred 
      yards wide.  The predatory look on Jane  s face is almost 
      sinister.  The hunt is on.

      FADE IN:


      A Victorian farmhouse in the country.  Two cars and a 
      sheriff's department cruiser outside.  Jane and Lisbon and 
      Hardy get out of Hardy's vehicle and approach the Plaskett 
      front door, where a DEPUTY is standing. 

      Hardy takes a wad of gum from his mouth, tosses it.  

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    Man, this nicotine gum is like 
                    chewing on a tire. 

                                  LISBON
                    Tell us about the family.

                    Old money.  Mr. Plaskett's an 
                      architect.  Mom's a sculptor.  
                    There's been Plasketts in the 
                    county since before there was a 
                    county.  Which counts around here. 
                    I've been in town ten years and I'm 
                    still the new guy.   

      The Sheriff is interrupted by ARDEN PLASKETT as they enter... 


      DANI FOGARTY, (40/50's) female, is tinkering with smoke 
      nozzle on her plane when Van Pelt approaches.

                                    FOGARTY
                    Hey.

      Van Pelt shows her badge.

                    Yes ma am. I do. 

      She points.  They head toward the hangar...


      The bad end of town.  Rundown tract houses and dirt yards 
      with mean dogs and dirty children in them. 

      Jane, Lisbon, Hardy and TWO DEPUTIES walk from their parked 
      cars along the street toward Guthrie's meager house.

                                    SHERIFF HARDY

                    Okay, well you hang back a tad uh?  
                    We'll take this nice and easy.  
                    Mace Guthrie's a bona fide bad guy.  
                    B and E mostly, but he has a couple 
                    of serious assaults and a statutory 
                    rape on his sheet.

      On Hardy's gesture, the Deputies go around the back.  


      Hardy bangs on the front door.  No reply.  

      Communicating with gestures, Lisbon and Hardy draw their 
      weapons and enter the unlocked house.  The SOUND of a 
      ferocious DOG BARKING O.S and half beat later Lisbon and 
      Hardy come running out.  Hardy slams the door just in time to 
      stop a BIG VICIOUS DOG exiting.

      MACE GUTHRIE comes out of a window, hits an oncoming DEPUTY 
      with a length of wood; and books it down the alleyway.  The 
      second Deputy appears only in time to draw his gun and aim 
      before Guthrie dodges around a corner and out of our sight.  
      The Deputy gives chase.  Lisbon and Jane and Hardy come from 
      around the side of the house. 

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    You okay, Duke?

      The Deputy nods, a little shamefaced.  The other Deputy 
      returns limping, telegraphing a shrug to say "lost him."  
      Guthrie's dog comes out into the yard and barks at them all 
      through the fence.  

                                  JANE
                    That's a loyal dog.


      One of the Deputies is poised, ready to open the door to the 
      yard, with a stick in his hand.  Hardy is at the wheel of his 
      cruiser, Lisbon next to him.  Jane in the backseat.  Hardy 
      nods.  The Deputy opens the gate.  The dog streaks out of the 
      yard and down the alleyway in the same direction that Guthrie 
      went.  Hardy's cruiser follows.  


      VARIOUS SHOTS:  Guthrie's dog comes at a steady trot, 
      snuffling, following a scent.  Half a block back comes 
      Hardy's cruiser, following the dog.


      A half renovated house surrounded by a chain link fence.  
      Guthrie's dog leans up against the fence on its hind legs, 
      looking in.  Hardy's cruiser pulls up.  Jane et al get out.


      Hardy and Lisbon have guns drawn as they open the shed door.  
      Inside, standing against the back wall looking awkward with 
      nowhere to hide, is Mace Guthrie.    

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    Hands up.

                    Okay okay.

      ANGLE: Jane gingerly pats the dog.

      A gorgeous day amid rolling fertile green fields, the sun 
      just risen over mountains clear on the horizon.  


      Jane and Lisbon walk up to the front door.  DRAKE PLASKETT 
      (late 20's) comes out to meet them.  He's a tall earnest Ivy 
      Leaguer of the Saab-driving eco-liberal, good friends with 
      one of the young Kennedys, variety.  Right now, he's looking 
      tired and anguished, but putting up a good stoic front.

                                  ROSALIND (V.O.)
                    Dear Roy, I found this address on a 
                    business card of yours that I 
                      discovered down the back of the 
                    sofa.  And so I write to you today 
                    in the faint hope that this letter 
                    may find you.  If it does, and you 
                    are reading this, I just want to 
                    say that I still love you very much 
                    despite the very cruel way you 
                    treated me, and I hope you will 
                    come back to me one day.  With all 
                    my heart, Rosalind. 

      Jane folds the letter transcript up.

                                  JANE
                    It's him.  I know it.  This Roy 
                      Tagliaferro is Red John. 

                                  LISBON
                    We don't know that.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    28.

                                  JANE
                    We know it was Red John killed 
                    Emma.  So we can assume it was Red 
                    John hired the skywriter.  
                    The skywriter got the order from   
                    R-Jay Solutions, and R-Jay 
                    Solutions is Roy Tagliaferro.  
                    Hence Roy Tagliaferro is Red John.

                                  LISBON
                    Maybe.

                                  JANE
                    We're close.  We're very close.

                                  LISBON 
                    You've thought that before now.   
                    And you had that exact same bright 
                    look in your eye.  Red John was a 
                    step ahead of us the whole time.  

                                  JANE 
                    Yes, but this time, I don't think 
                    so.  I think he's made a mistake.  
                    He can't possibly have known 
                    Rosalind would write to him, or 
                    that we'd find the letter.  It's 
                    luck.  One in a million luck.  This 
                    woman Rosalind has seen Red John, 
                    Lisbon.  She knows him.     


      A nice ordinary little house on an ordinary SMALL TOWN 
      STREET.  Jane and Lisbon approach the front door. 

      Inside, A BACH FUGUE IS BEING PLAYED EXPERTLY ON A GOOD 
      PIANO.  Lisbon RINGS THE DOORBELL.  The MUSIC STOPS.

                    We're sure this is the right

      The door is opened by a luminously beautiful woman, (30's) 
      ROSALIND HARKER.  There's an eerie grace about her.

      FADE IN:


      Rosalind stands in the doorway opposite Jane and Lisbon.

                                  ROSALIND
                    Roy Tagliaferro?  Yes, I know a man

                    What's happened?  How did you find

                                  LISBON
                    You sent him a letter last 
                      Christmas.  It surfaced during an 
                      investigation we're conducting. 

                                  ROSALIND
                    You read my letter.

                    Yes, ma'am.

                    Not a thing.  Until you tell me why 
                    you want to know.

      Jane and Lisbon look at each other.

                    We believe he could be a serial 
                    murderer named Red John.  

      Rosalind lets that sink in without displaying her feelings.

                                  JANE
                    He was very cruel to you.  You said 
                    so in the letter.

      Rosalind tries to shut the door, but Jane blocks it with his 
      foot.  Rosalind retreats upstairs.

                    ago, around the time Tagliaferro 
                    showed up, an old farm property,

                    There's more.  A company credit

      Lisbon marches off to her car, gets in and drives away.

      Jane and Hardy pull up at the fence line of a rundown farm 
      property.  A DERELICT OLD FARMHOUSE is visible a few hundred 
      feet off the road, down a dirt driveway.  The gate is chained 
      and locked shut.

                    Well, okay.  

      Hardy takes a shotgun from his trunk, and they climb over the 
      gate and walk down the driveway toward the house. 


      Jane and Hardy at the front door of the farmhouse.  It's 
      hanging half off its hinges.  Hardy pushes it open, shines a 
      FLASHLIGHT into the dark interior.  Hesitates to enter... 
      Jane's scared, but summons his courage, and goes in first.   

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      Cho on the phone, Rigsby on the phone also, both on the move 
      to their car...

                    Lisbon?  


      The CBI van, driven by Rigsby, with Cho in passenger side, 
      goes crashing through the front gate.  Speeds up the driveway 
      to the front door of the farmhouse.  A couple hundred yards 
      back come two CHP MOTORCYCLE COPS.


      PARAMEDICS arrive.  CHP Officers mill around.                  
      A FEMALE PARAMEDIC escorts Maya Plaskett from the house...


      Crossing the yard with Lisbon, we see...

      The FORENSICS TECH puts Hardy's shotgun on top of a FORENSICS 
      VEHICLE 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    53.

      Hardy lying unconscious, one arm cuffed to the rail of a 
      gurney, guarded by A CHP OFFICER.  Waiting for transfer of 
      custody before being loaded onto an ambulance.

      Walking away toward the road, Cho and Rigsby herding away TWO 
      DEPUTIES -- subordinates of Hardy's who can't believe what 
      they're hearing --

                                  CHO
                    Your boss was obsessed with Maya 
                    Plaskett.  Staged a break-in at her 
                    house so that he could plant a 
                    camera in her bedroom.  Watched her 
                    for months and schemed with Red 
                    John to abduct her and her sister 
                    and use them as bait to catch Jane 
                    as well.  

      As they get to the CBI vehicle...

                                  RIGSBY
                    Have a nice day now...

      Cho and Rigsby get in their car and drive off.

      CLOSE ON Hardy -- He's very very slowly using his free hand 
      to pull a HANDCUFF KEY from a hiding place in the back of his 
      belt.

      Lisbon approaches Maya who is sitting in the backseat of a 
      POLICE CAR, wrapped in a blanket. 

                                  LISBON
                    Maya, I have to sign some paperwork 
                    with the forensics people, and then 
                    we'll take you home.  Okay? 

                                  MAYA
                    Okay.

                                  LISBON
                    You need anything?

                                  MAYA
                    I'm good.  Thank you.

      Maya's face turns ashen and her eyes go wide -- Lisbon turns 
      to see what Maya's reacting to... 

      HER POV -- Hardy uses the CHP Officer's own gun to shoot him 
      dead.  BLAAAM!  And then Hardy TURNS AND COMES AT LISBON AND 
      MAYA.  Cho and Rigsby and the other Officers are out of 
      sight.  Lisbon's gun is holstered.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    54.

      She reaches for it, but there's no time.  Hardy points the 
      gun at her head.  BLAAAM!  Hardy drops, shot in the back.  
      Lisbon's unharmed.

      MOS -- BACH'S PRELUDE in C major from the well tempered 
      clavier plays over....

      Jane stands by the evidence table, shotgun smoking in his 
      hands.  He puts down the gun and goes to Hardy, as does 
      Lisbon.  They kneel on either side of the dying man.  Hardy 
      smiles at Jane, makes a lip-zipping gesture and dies.  Jane 
      and Lisbon look at each other...


      MOS -- Lisbon and Maya sit in the backseat.  Jane sits in the 
      front passenger seat.  All lost in their own thoughts.

      A CHP OFFICER gets in the driver's seat and starts the car.


      MOS -- DAWN.  The Marshal's car in motion. 


      MOS -- Maya gets out of the Marshal's car as Arden, Noah and 
      Drake come running to greet her.  They embrace joyfully, 
      filled with love and deep relief.  Jane and Lisbon get out of 
      the car.   

      After a moment, Arden breaks away to go to Lisbon and thank 
      her effusively.


      Jane quietly walks away from the happy group, down the 
      COUNTRY ROAD.  He stops to pick an orange from a tree, and 
      he's peeling the orange as he walks on, and we...   

                                                                        FADE OUT.
