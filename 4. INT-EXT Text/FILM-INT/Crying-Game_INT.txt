A mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front,
three in the back.
On the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet
on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a
gun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is
smoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat
innocent.
FERGUS
So what's your name, soldier?
4.
JODY
Fuck you.
FERGUS
Yeah.
Jody pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small
lean man, talks to him through the hood.
MAGUIRE
The situation is simple. You're being
held hostage by the Irish Republican
Army. They've got one of our senior
members under interrogation in
Castleraigh. We've informed them that if
they don't release him within three days,
you'll be shot. You'll be treated as our
guest until further developments. Have
you anything to say?
Jody is motionless under the black hood.
FERGUS
Give him a cup of tea.
MAGUIRE
Do you want a cup of tea?
He still says nothing.
DISSOLVE.
All the men are drinking tea. The blond woman comes in with a
plate and some food on it.
FERGUS
See does he want some.
JUDE
Do you want some food?
Jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing.
DISSOLVE.
Late at night -- it is dark. The men are sleeping. Fergus is
sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner.
Jude comes in, with a flashlight.
5.
FERGUS
Hey -- what's he like?
JUDE
Horny bastard.
FERGUS
Did you give him it?
JUDE
There are certain things I wouldn't do
for my country.
FERGUS
Have a look at him.
JUDE
Can't.
FERGUS
Poke him or something. See if he's still
alive.
JUDE
He's all right.
FERGUS
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on.
Have a heart.
She moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her
foot. He doesn't move. Then she lifts the hood ever so
slightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like
lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off,
throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude.
JODY
You fucking bitch -- you fucking whore --
He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He
writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love. She is
screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing
guns, screaming.
MAGUIRE
Turn the fucking thing off --
Dusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. Broken glass. The
sun pouring through. Fergus leads Jody over to a wrought iron
chair and sits him in it. He sits opposite, gun on his lap.
Fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. He
holds one out toward him.
7.
FERGUS
Eat something, would you?
JODY
Can't.
FERGUS
What do you mean you can't?
JODY
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is
revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats,
slowly.
JODY
This is a farce, man.
FERGUS
How is it a farce?
JODY
I seen your fucking face.
FERGUS
So, what do I look like?
JODY
You're the one about five ten with the
killer smile and the baby face.
FERGUS
Am I?
JODY
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
Fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's
mouth.
JODY
You're the handsome one.
Jody eats the last bits.
JODY
Thank you, handsome.
FERGUS
My pleasure.
8.
It is sweltering now in the greenhouse. CLOSE ON JODY'S
COWLED HEAD. The hood is drenched with sweat.
JODY
I can't fucking breathe, man. Be a
Christian, will you?
Jude comes into view.
JODY
Tell him to take the hood off, honey...
Jude says nothing. Lays the tea on the ground.
FERGUS
How did you know it was her?
JODY
I can smell her perfume.
Jude pours out the tea.
JUDE
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have
to shoot you. As it is, you've got a
fifty-fifty chance.
JODY
Thought you liked me, bitch.
JUDE
It was fun while it lasted.
JODY
Nice lady.
His breathing becomes labored.
JODY
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
FERGUS
Can't we take it off?
JUDE
Have to check with himself.
9.
Fergus gives her the gun.
FERGUS
You look after him.
Jody's head follows Fergus while he leaves.
JODY
Don't leave me with her, man. She's
dangerous...
Jude smiles, holding the gun on her lap.
Fergus enters. Maguire and the others. Maguire has a
newspaper, which has a headline regarding the kidnapping.
MAGUIRE
Made the front page. They'll move now,
the fuckers.
FERGUS
Request permission to take the hood off,
Tommy.
MAGUIRE
Why would you do that?
FERGUS
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
MAGUIRE
So?
FERGUS
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
MAGUIRE
You sure?
FERGUS
He described me down to a T. Knows what
Jude looks like.
Maguire reads the paper.
FERGUS
Tommy --
10.
MAGUIRE
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him
seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the
only one he looks at.
FERGUS
Thanks.
MAGUIRE
It's your decision.
Jude, drinking tea, looking at Jody sweating. Fergus enters.
He puts his arm casually around her.
FERGUS
Leave us, Judie.
JUDE
My pleasure.
She goes. Fergus walks to Jody and slowly takes the hood off.
Jody looks up at him, his face bathed in sweat. He breathes
in mighty gulps of air. He smiles.
JODY
Thank you, soldier.
Fergus smiles.
JODY
Never thought fresh air would taste this
good.
Fergus pours out a cup of tea and brings it to his lips.
JODY
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be
able to feed myself.
FERGUS
No fucking way.
JODY
Only joking.
Fergus drinks.
JODY
You know, I was wrong about one thing.
11.
FERGUS
What's that?
JODY
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no
pinup.
FERGUS
No?
JODY
Nope. Not handsome at all.
FERGUS
You trying to hurt my feelings?
JODY
No. It's the truth.
FERGUS
Well, I could say the same about you.
JODY
Could you?
FERGUS
But I won't. We're more polite around
these parts.
JODY
So I've noticed.
Fergus looks at him. Jody isn't smiling anymore. Fergus goes
back to his seat and drinks his tea. He fingers the gun on
his lap.
JODY
Hey --
FERGUS
What is it now?
JODY
You're going to have to do it, aren't
you?
FERGUS
Do what?
JODY
Kill me.
12.
FERGUS
What makes you think that?
JODY
They're going to let that guy die. And
you're going to kill me.
FERGUS
They won't let him die.
JODY
You want to bet?
FERGUS
I'm not a gambling man.
JODY
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't
just let me loose.
FERGUS
Why can't we?
JODY
Not in your nature.
FERGUS
What do you know about my nature?
JODY
I'm talking about your people, not you.
FERGUS
What the fuck do you know about my
people?
JODY
Only that you're all tough undeluded
motherfuckers. And that it's not in your
nature to let me go.
FERGUS
Shut the fuck up, would you?
JODY
And you know the funny thing?
FERGUS
No, what's the funny thing?
JODY
I didn't even fancy her.
13.
FERGUS
Didn't look like that to me...
JODY
She's not my type.
He looks at Fergus.
JODY
C'mere.
FERGUS
No.
JODY
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
FERGUS
What?
JODY
My inside pocket.
Fergus holds the gun to his face. He fishes inside Jody's
inside pocket.
JODY
Take out the wallet.
Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet.
JODY
Open it.
CLOSE ON THE WALLET. Credit cards, army identification
photograph.
JODY
Inside. There's a picture.
Fergus takes out a picture. It is of Jody, in cricket whites,
smiling, holding a bat. Fergus smiles.
JODY
No, not that one. There's another.
Fergus takes out another picture of Jody and of a beautiful
black woman, smiling.
JODY
Now she's my type.
14.
FERGUS
She'd be anyone's type.
JODY
Don't you think of it, fucker.
FERGUS
Why not?
JODY
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit
you.
FERGUS
No?
JODY
Absolutely not.
FERGUS
She your wife?
JODY
Suppose you could say that.
Jody chuckles.
FERGUS
You make a nice couple.
JODY
Don't I know it.
FERGUS
So what were you fucking around for,
then?
JODY
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
FERGUS
She's a friend of mine
JODY
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar.
I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here
anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my
hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't
like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe
I'll get to understand.
FERGUS
What?
15.
JODY
What the fuck am I doing here.
FERGUS
What the fuck were you doing here?
JODY
I got sent.
FERGUS
You could have said no.
JODY
Can't. Once I signed up.
FERGUS
Why did you sign up?
JODY
It was a job. So I get sent to the only
place in the world they call you nigger
to your face.
FERGUS
Shouldn't take it personally.
JODY
(He imitates a Belfast accent)
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No
use telling them I came from Tottenham.
FERGUS
And you play cricket?.
JODY
Best game in the world.
FERGUS
Ever see hurling?
JODY
That game where a bunch of paddies whack
sticks at each other?
FERGUS
Best game in the world.
JODY
Never.
FERGUS
The fastest.
16.
JODY
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black
man's game. The kids play it from the age
of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies
from the age of five. Then we moved to
Tottenham and it was something different.
FERGUS
How different?
JODY
Toffs' game there. But not at home.
.
Fergus looks at him.
JODY
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy,
remember, you're getting rid of a shit-
hot bowler.
FERGUS
I'll bear that in mind.
He keeps looking at him.
FERGUS
And by the way, it's not Paddy. It's
Fergus.
Jody smiles.
JODY
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
FERGUS
My pleasure, Jody
Fergus leads Jody back to his chair.
JODY
Fergus?
FERGUS
Yeah?
JODY
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
He begins to laugh.
FERGUS
The pleasure was all mine.
Fergus begins to laugh, without knowing why.
Jody, still laughing. Suddenly the hood is slammed back over
his head.
Maguire, standing there in the dark, looking at Fergus.
19.
MAGUIRE
What the fuck is this?
FERGUS
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of
humor, that's all.
MAGUIRE
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth
shut. Go in and get some sleep.
Fergus gets up slowly, walks toward the door.
JODY
Yeah. Get some sleep.
Fergus sleeping.
Jody sleeping. Maguire sitting with an Armalite in his hands,
watching him.
Fergus enters, with a tray and some breakfast. Maguire is
sitting where he sat before, stock-still.
FERGUS
Did he talk?
Maguire shakes his head.
FERGUS
Didn't make you laugh?
Maguire shakes his head.
FERGUS
Here. Have some breakfast.
He hands Maguire a plate. Jody stirs.
20.
JODY
Good morning, Fergus?
Maguire looks hard at him.
MAGUIRE
So he knows your name?
FERGUS
I told him.
MAGUIRE
Are you all there?
He rises, and drags Fergus out the door.
FERGUS
Back in a minute, Jody
Jody sitting with the hood on again. Fergus enters.
JODY
They giving you trouble, Fergus?
Fergus says nothing. He takes a plate and brings it toward
Jody
21.
JODY
It happens. Y'see, there's two kinds of
people. Those who give and those who
take.
Fergus lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth and begins to
feed him.
JODY
Ah, take the thing off, man.
Fergus says nothing and keeps feeding him.
JODY
It's okay. I understand. Don't mind if I
prattle on, do you?
Fergus shakes his head and says nothing.
JODY
I will take it by your silence that you
don't.
He eats. Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody.
JODY
Two types, Fergus. The scorpion and the
frog. Ever heard of them?
Fergus says nothing.
JODY
Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he
can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can,
and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I
give you a ride on my back, you'll go and
sting me." Scorpion replies, "It would
not be in my interest to sting you since
as I'll be on your back we both would
drown." Frog thinks about this logic for
a while and accepts the deal. Takes the
scorpion on his back. Braves the waters.
Halfway over feels a burning spear in his
side and realizes the scorpion has stung
him after all. And as they both sink
beneath the waves the frog cries out,
"Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for
now we both will drown?" Scorpion
replies, "I can't help it, it's in my
nature."
Jody chuckles under his hood.
22.
FERGUS
So what's that supposed to mean?
JODY
Means what it says. The scorpion does
what is in his nature. Take off the hood,
man.
FERGUS
Why?
JODY
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood. Jody smiles
up at him.
JODY
See? I was right about you.
FERGUS
Don't be so sure.
JODY
Jody's always right.
Both men dozing in the heat.
JODY
Where would you most like to be now, man?
FERGUS
Doesn't matter where.
JODY
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
FERGUS
Having a pint in the Rock.
JODY
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of
something more alluring.
FERGUS
Like what?
JODY
Like having a pint in the Metro --
Fergus laughs.
23.
FERGUS
Having two pints in the Rock.
JODY
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's
having a margarita.
FERGUS
Who's Dil?
JODY
My special friend.
FERGUS
Oh, yeah.
JODY
We got simple tastes, you and me.
FERGUS
The best.
JODY
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
FERGUS
Do you?
JODY
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're
finished. But you guys are never
finished, are you?
FERGUS
We don't look on it like that.
JODY
I've often wondered how you do it.
FERGUS
Depends on what you believe in.
JODY
What do you believe in?
FERGUS
That you guys shouldn't be here.
JODY
It's as simple as that?
FERGUS
Yes.
24.
Jude enters.
JUDE
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
FERGUS
He's hot.
JUDE
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover
the fucker up.
JODY
Have you no feelings, woman?
JUDE
You shut your face --
She pulls the hood down over him.
JUDE
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
JODY
He's a good soldier, Jude.
She whacks him with a pistol.
JUDE
I said shut the fuck up --
JODY
He believes in the future --
Jody, sitting in the hood. Fergus lifts it a bit; Jody's
mouth, with blood now in his lips.
FERGUS
Is it bad?
JODY
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know
that, Fergus?
FERGUS
I didn't.
JODY
Some kinds of women are...
25.
FERGUS
She can't help it.
JODY
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
FERGUS
You liked her?
JODY
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever
she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus.
Will you think of her too?
FERGUS
Don't know her.
JODY
Want you to do something, Fergus.
FERGUS
What?
JODY
If they kill me --
FERGUS
Don't think that way.
JODY
But they will. As sure as night follows
day. They have to. I want you to find her
out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
Fergus is moved. He can't reply.
JODY
See if she's all right.
FERGUS
I don't know her.
JODY
Take her picture. C'mere.
Fergus walks toward him.
JODY
Take it. In the inside pocket.
Their faces, close to each other as Fergus searches out her
picture.
26.
JODY
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
FERGUS
I told you not to talk that way --
JODY
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in
Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a
margarita. Don't have to tell her who you
are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
FERGUS
Stop it --
The door opens. Maguire is there, with another.
MAGUIRE
Volunteer?
Fergus turns toward him.
MAGUIRE
We need you inside.
Fergus walks toward Maguire and the other man walks forward,
takes his seat. Fergus, unseen by Maguire, puts the wallet in
his pocket.
Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and the others.
MAGUIRE
We've had word. They've used every trick
in the book on him. He's starting to
talk. You're going to have to do it in
the morning.
Maguire lights a cigarette. Fergus looks at him and nods.
MAGUIRE
You OK about that?
FERGUS
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
MAGUIRE
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts
about you for the last few days.
JUDE
Not the only one --
27.
MAGUIRE
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep
tonight, Fergus.
FERGUS
Peter.
MAGUIRE
What?
FERGUS
Request permission to guard the prisoner
tonight --
JUDE
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
MAGUIRE
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
He turns back to Fergus. He puts his arm on Fergus's
shoulder.
MAGUIRE
Why do you want to do that for?
FERGUS
Would make me feel better about it.
MAGUIRE
You sure about that?
FERGUS
I'm sure.
MAGUIRE
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
Fergus leaves.
Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody.
Jody begins to laugh under the hood. It turns into the sound
of crying.
FERGUS
Don't.
JODY
I'm sorry.
28.
The crying stops.
JODY
Help me.
FERGUS
How can I?
JODY
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a
cigarette.
Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's
hood so he can smoke.
JODY
Don't even smoke, you know that? It just
seemed the right thing to do.
Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above
his lips. Jody coughs, but keeps the cigarette in his lips.
Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth.
FERGUS
Go to sleep now.
JODY
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
FERGUS
What?
JODY
A story.
FERGUS
Like the one about the frog?
JODY
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
FERGUS
When I was a child...
JODY
Yeah?
FERGUS
I thought as a child. But when I became a
man I put away childish things...
JODY
What does that mean?
29.
FERGUS
Nothing.
JODY
Tell me something, anything.
Fergus is silent; his eyes wet.
JODY
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
FERGUS
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
Tinker sitting in the greenhouse. A helicopter screams into
view through the panes and automatic fire comes from it,
shattering every pane in seconds and tearing Tinker to bits.
Bullets whipping through every window, taking chunks from the
masonry, tearing the walls apart. Maguire, Jude, and the
others on the floor, scrambling for weapons.
The old man pouring whiskey into a teacup.
33.
TOMMY
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
FERGUS
That's wise, Tommy.
TOMMY
All right, then. I like to be wise.
He pours Fergus more whiskey.
TOMMY
So what do you need, Fergus?
FERGUS
Need to go across the water.
TOMMY
Do you now.
FERGUS
Need to lose myself awhile.
TOMMY
Aha.
He looks at Fergus and lights a cigarette.
He puffs.
TOMMY
There's a man I know ships cattle to
London.
FADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in
clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at
a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in
laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the
bricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and
relentlessly, like a machine.
We see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls
away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust
and the growing hole.
34.
Fergus's face, as he works.
The hole. More bricks falling away. Through the clouds of
dust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green.
Fergus's face, working. His rhythm slows.
The hole. More bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops. The
dust begins to clear.
His face.
The jagged hole. The dust drifts across it, revealing a
cricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the
green.
Fergus dressing. He puts on a cheap suit, like any country
boy in a big city. He takes Jody's wallet from the trousers
of his overalls. He flips it open, sees the picture of the
soldier and Dil. He puts it in the pocket of his suit.
Fergus enters. The door gives a loud ping.
A GIRL
We're closing. I'll see you tomorrow, Dil
She leaves the salon.
DIL
You want something in particular?
35.
FERGUS
Just a bit of a trim...
Dil checks her watch and stubs out a cigarette.
DIL
Come on...
She gestures toward a chair. Fergus sits down. She comes
toward him and fiddles with his hair.
She pushes his head back into a basin behind him. She begins
to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo.
DIL
Someone recommend you?
FERGUS
In a way.
DIL
Who?
FERGUS
Guy I work with.
DIL
What's his name?
Fergus can't think of an answer. The hands with the purple
nails run over his scalp.
FERGUS
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
DIL
What's it to you?
FERGUS
Nothing.
Fergus, sitting up. She begins to cut.
DIL
You American?
FERGUS
No.
DIL
Not English.
36.
FERGUS
No.
DIL
Scottish?
FERGUS
How'd you guess?
DIL
The accent, I suppose.
FERGUS
And what's it like?
DIL
Like treacle.
She imitates his accent saying it. Fergus laughs.
DIL
Nice laugh.
Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds
a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks
like a young London stockbroker. The hair salon around them
is empty.
DIL
That should make her happy.
FERGUS
Who's she?
DIL
Don't know. Who is she?
Half full, with an after-work crowd. Dil makes her way
through it.
BARMAN
Hi, Dil
DIL
Hiya, hon.
She sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and
takes a seat.
BARMAN
What'll it be?
FERGUS
A bottle of Guinness.
Dil, looking at Fergus.
DIL
See that, Col?
COL
See what, Dil?
DIL
He gave me a look.
COL
Did he?
Fergus blushes. He buries himself in his drink.
DIL
Just cut his hair, you know.
COL
Yeah?
DIL
What you think?
COL
Nice.
Fergus throws his eyes toward her again. She has her face
turned away, but sees him in the mirror.
DIL
There, he did it again.
38.
COL
Saw that one.
DIL
What would you call it?
COL
Now, that was a look.
She eyes Fergus in the mirror.
DIL
Ask him to ask me what I'm drinking.
The barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus.
COL
She wants to know do you want to know
what she's drinking.
Fergus is about to talk when she pipes up.
DIL
A margarita.
The barman mixes it. She stares at the mirror, staring at
Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her
the drink.
DIL
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like
his hair, Col.
COL
She wants to know, sir, do you like your
hair.
FERGUS
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
DIL
He's Scottish, Col.
COL
Scottish?
FERGUS
Yeah.
DIL
What'd he say, Col?
39.
COL
He agreed that he was.
DIL
What do you think his name is?
COL
I've no thoughts on the subject.
FERGUS
Jimmy.
DIL
Jimmy?
COL
That's what he said. Jimmy.
DIL
Hi, Jimmy.
FERGUS
Hiya, Dil
A burly man sits down beside her. He puts his hand on her
knee.
MAN
Sing the song, Dil --
She slaps the hand away.
DIL
Fuck off, Dave.
DAVE
C'mon, babe! You know what I like...
Easy!
She turns back to Fergus and finds his seat empty.
Fergus, in bed. Fade to black as we see Jody as a bowler,
running in slow motion, toward the camera. He releases the
ball; we see Fergus in bed, breathing heavily.
Fergus takes a break and watches the batsman hit a ball. He
imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer. Then a
voice interrupts him.
DEVEROUX
So Pat's a cricket fan, eh?
Fergus turns. We see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type
in a three-piece suit, whose house it is. Beside him is
Franknum, the cockney foreman.
FERGUS
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
DEVEROUX
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as
you remember you're not at Lords.
Fergus resumes work.
It is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street
chic, a lot of leather All the women are heavily made-up.
Someone is singing from the tiny stage and rows of cheap
colored bulbs are flashing around it.
41.
From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never
been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap
suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar.
AT THE BAR.
Fergus looks through the odd crowd, but can't find Dil. Col,
the barman, sees him and smiles.
COL
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
FERGUS
Is that good or bad?
COL
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col.
Things like that.
Col pushes a colored cocktail with one of those Japanese
umbrellas toward him.
COL
So let's call this the usual.
FERGUS
Thanks.
Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts.
COL
No, no. It's on me.
Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by
implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts
the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the
way.
COL
Take it out, if you want.
Fergus takes out the umbrella. He holds it in one hand and
drinks with the other.
COL
You came to see her, didn't you?
Fergus shrugs. He takes out a cigarette. A guy in leather to
his left smiles at him.
COL
Something I should tell you. She's --
42.
FERGUS
She's what?
The barman looks up toward the stage.
COL
She's on.
THE JUKEBOX.
A hand presses a button. The needle selects a disk. A song by
Dave Berry, "The Crying Game."
AT THE BAR.
Fergus looks up. Close-up of Dil's hand, as music begins,
making movements to the music. We see Dil, standing on a
stage, swaying slightly. She seems a little drunk. She mimes
to the song. She mouths the words so perfectly and the voice
on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing
who is doing the singing. She does all sorts of strange
movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands.
The crowd seems to know this act. They cheer, whether out of
approval or derision we can't be sure.
Fergus watching.
Dil singing, noticing him. She comes to the end of the song.
The crowd cheers.
Fergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar,
toward him.
DIL
He's still looking, Col.
COL
Persistent.
DIL
Good thing in a man.
COL
An excellent quality.
DIL
Maybe he wants something.
COL
I would expect he does.
43.
DIL
Ask him.
COL
Ask him yourself.
She looks at Fergus directly, sits down next to him.
DIL
So tell me.
Fergus says nothing. He shrugs.
DIL
Everybody wants something.
FERGUS
Not me.
DIL
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned
and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
Col shrugs.
DIL
You old-fashioned?
FERGUS
Must be.
The burly man comes up to her.
MAN
Got the money, Dil?
DIL
Fuck off, Dave.
DAVE
You fucking promised.
DIL
Did I?
DAVE
You fucking did.
He suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her
drink.
DAVE
Didn't you? Well, come on!
44.
He drags her through the crowd. In the mirror, Fergus watches
them go. The barman eyes him.
COL
It takes all types.
FERGUS
So who's he?
COL
He's what she should run a mile from.
FERGUS
Then why doesn't she?
COL
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door.
Fergus and Dil looking at their menus. A waiter places drinks
on their table, then leaves.
DIL
Now's the time you're meant to do
something, isn't it?
FERGUS
Like what?
DIL
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the
way it goes?
FERGUS
Must be.
49.
Dil comes in in the darkness. Fergus stands like a shadow in
the doorway. The light comes on; she takes off her raincoat.
DIL
Won't hurt you to come in.
Fergus enters slowly. He looks around the room; there is an
exaggerated femininity about everything in it.
DIL
Would you like a drink?
FERGUS
Yes, please.
DIL
What'll it be?
FERGUS
Whiskey.
She goes into a small kitchen. Fergus looks at the
mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody. The camera tracks
into the soldier's smiling face. Then into Fergus's face. His
reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside -- Dave's.
She comes through with two drinks.
FERGUS
Someone out there.
DIL
Jesus fucking Christ.
She opens the window door, and we see Dave on the street, in
a neck brace.
DIL
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
DAVE
It's Dave.
She goes back into the room and begins taking things up.
DAVE
Talk to me, Dil --
51.
DIL
Sure, Dave --
DAVE
Please, Dil --
She flings things down: men's clothes, leather trousers, a
suitcase, a teddy bear.
DIL
Take your clothes.
DAVE
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
DIL
Fuck off back to Essex!
DAVE
Fucking mad!
Fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of
rejection with his things in his arms.
DAVE
Don't chuck my clothes out!
DIL
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down. The bowl
breaks to bits on the pavement. Goldfish thrash around in the
street.
DAVE
You fucking bitch!
He tries to pick up the flapping fish in his hands.
DAVE
Murderer!
Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut.
DIL
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a
brace?
FERGUS
Must be in love to manage that.
DIL
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
52.
Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass.
FERGUS
He lived here with you?
DIL
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
Fergus walks past the photograph and sits down. He looks from
her to the picture.
FERGUS
What about him?
He nods toward the picture. She looks down into her drink.
DIL
He was different.
FERGUS
How different?
DIL
As different as it's possible to be.
FERGUS
Tell me about him.
DIL
No.
FERGUS
Shouldn't I go?
DIL
Yes.
And they fall into one another's arms. She stretches up with
her whole body over him. They grow suddenly and violently
passionate.
They fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. The
photograph above them seems to smile. He draws up her dress
with his hands. She suddenly pulls away.
DIL
No --
FERGUS
Did you do that to him?
She comes up toward him once more. She puts her mouth close
to his ear.
53.
DIL
You want to know how I kissed him?
FERGUS
Yes...
DIL
Are you jealous of him?
FERGUS
Maybe.
DIL
That's good...
She opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down
his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her
hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while
her other hand undoes his pants. She kisses his stomach; her
mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of
Jody. Jody's eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her
head and kisses his mouth. There are tears in his eyes.
FERGUS
What would he think?
DIL
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He
was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
She sits in front of the mirror.
FERGUS
Do you miss him?
DIL
What do you think?
FERGUS
I think you do.
DIL
(dreamily)
You say that like a gentleman.
FERGUS
Do I?
DIL
Like you're concerned.
Fergus gets up and stands behind her, gently pushes the hair
from her face.
54.
DIL
But you can t stay, you know that?
FERGUS
Didn't think I could.
DIL
A real gentleman...
She embraces him.
FERGUS
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
DIL
I am.
She sits back down in front of the mirror. Fergus leaves. She
reapplies her lipstick.
Singer in a blue dress. Dil and Fergus by the bar. Both
drinking drinks with umbrellas. Dave comes up behind them
with his neck brace.
DAVE
Look, I'm sorry.
DIL
Fuck off, Dave.
DAVE
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm
sorry, didn't I?
DIL
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Fergus nods. He stands. Dave steps two feet back.
FERGUS
I was only going to ask her for a dance.
Fergus takes Dil's arm.
FERGUS
Shall we?
The woman is singing.
As they circle, people begin to look at them admiringly. Dil
holds her cheek close to his.
55.
FERGUS
Did he come here too?
DIL
Is this an obsession of yours?
FERGUS
Maybe.
DIL
He did sometimes.
FERGUS
Did he dance with you?
Dil doesn't answer. Looks at him out of the corner of her
eye.
DIL
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
FERGUS
Want to look after you.
DIL
What does that mean?
FERGUS
Something I heard someone say once.
She draws back and looks at him.
DIL
You mean that?
FERGUS
Yeah.
She dances closer.
DIL
Why?
FERGUS
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
In the bar, people singing along with the music. Col sings.
Dave sitting at the bar, sulking.
DIL
You're not having me on, are you? 'Cause
Dil can't stand that.
56.
FERGUS
No.
She puts her cheek against his. Dave, at the bar, slams his
drink down.
DIL
And she does get very upset...
Dave stands up to leave. On the stage the act finishes. Dil
draws Fergus back to the bar.
AT THE BAR.
Col, the barman, pours her drink.
DIL
One for him, too.
Col pours and smiles.
DIL
Drink.
FERGUS
What is this?
DIL
I'm superstitious. Drink.
He drinks. He grimaces. She throws it back in one.
DIL
Can't leave me now.
FERGUS
Aha.
DIL
The thing is, can you go the distance?
FERGUS
Depends what it is.
DIL
No, depends on nothing.
She takes the bottle herself and fills their glasses. She
slams it back. He sips.
DIL
In one.
57.
She tilts his glass back. He swallows it in one.
She enters; Fergus walks in slowly. He looks from the cricket
whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the
photographs.
DIL
What you thinking of, hon?
FERGUS
I'm thinking of your man.
DIL
Why?
FERGUS
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
DIL
Told you, I'm superstitious.
She turns toward him and undoes her hair. It falls around her
shoulders.
FERGUS
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
DIL
All the time.
Fergus runs his hand down her throat.
DIL
Even now.
FERGUS
No...
DIL
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
She draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him
down. They kiss passionately.
DIL
Give me one minute.
She walks into the bathroom. Fergus lies there, looking at
the picture, listening to the sound of running water. She
comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. She looks
extraordinarily beautiful.
58.
He reaches out his hand and grasps hers. He draws her toward
him. He begins to kiss her face and neck.
FERGUS
Would he have minded?
She murmurs no. His hands slip the wrap down from her
shoulders.
CLOSE ON HIS HANDS, traveling down her neck, in the darkness.
Then the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently,
with a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a
close-up, that she is a man.
Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her.
DIL
You did know, didn't you?
Fergus says nothing.
DIL
Oh my God.
She gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch
him. Fergus smacks the hand away.
FERGUS
Jesus. I feel sick --
He gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet.
DIL
Don't go, Jimmy --
He kicks her away. He runs into the bathroom and vomits into
the tub.
She crouches on the floor.
DIL
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
He retches again.
DIL
What were you doing in the bar if you
didn't know -- I'm bleeding...
She lights a cigarette.
Fergus runs the taps. He washes his face, rinses his mouth.
59.
DIL
It's all right, Jimmy. I can take it.
Just not on the face.
Fergus slams the door shut. She is sitting on the couch, the
kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman. A
trace of blood on her mouth.
DIL
Y'see, I'm not a young thing any
longer.... Funny the way things go. Don't
you find that, Jimmy? Never the way you
expected.
Fergus comes out of the bathroom.
FERGUS
I'm sorry.
She looks up. Some hope in her face.
DIL
You mean that?
And he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him.
DIL
Don't go like that. Say something...
He pulls away from her. She falls to the floor.
DIL
Jesus.
He drags himself away and runs down the stairs.
Fergus in bed. Flash to shot of blackness, Jody grinning in
cricket whites, throwing the ball up and down in his hand.
The place is hopping. Fergus enters. He now sees it as he
should have seen it the first night -- as a transvestite bar.
He makes his way through the crowds. All the women too-
heavily made-up. Some beautifully sleek young things he looks
at he realizes are young men. He makes his way to the bar
where Dil is sitting, nursing a drink with an umbrella in it.
Her face is bruised. She is wearing dark glasses.
As he walks toward her she sees him in the mirror. She talks
to Col the barman.
60.
DIL
He's back, Col
COL
Hi.
DIL
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They
don't mean much.
COL
Stop it, Dil --
DIL
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Fergus sits. Col turns to him.
COL
She wants me to tell you go fuck
yourself.
FERGUS
I'm sorry.
There is a tear running down her cheek, under the dark
glasses.
DIL
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
FERGUS
Dil --
DIL
Tell him it hurt --
FERGUS
I have to talk to her, Col --
COL
Says he's got to talk to you --
Fergus touches her arm.
FERGUS
Come on, Dil --
DIL
Where?
She whips her arm away.
61.
DIL
Tell him again, Col. Go fuck himself --
She walks into the crowd, toward the door.
Fergus leaves.
Fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the
pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving
glass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch
basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high
heels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks
out.
Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving
toward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters.
As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift,
which rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a
ladder toward Fergus .
DEVEROUX
How much did that frame cost, Mr.
Franknum?
FRANKNUM
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
DEVEROUX
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
FERGUS
Sorry.
62.
DEVEROUX
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back,
will it, Mr. Franknum?
FRANKNUM
Not in my experience.
DEVEROUX
Off his wages.
FERGUS
Do you mean that?
DEVEROUX
He wants to know do I mean that.
FRANKNUM
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
DEVEROUX
Bloody right I do...
Through this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf
whistles increasing. He looks out the gap where the window
should be and sees Dil in the lift. The laborers whistle at
her, looking up her skirt, etc.
She passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him.
DEVEROUX
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
FERGUS
She's not a tart.
DEVEROUX
No, of course not, she's a lady.
FERGUS
She's not that either.
Fergus walks out of the room.
Fergus walks round the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves,
sits on some bricks and opens the hamper.
DIL
Darling --
She is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife. She is
wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face. She
pecks him on the cheek.
63.
DIL
Never let the sun go down on an argument,
Jody used to say.
FERGUS
What you doing here?
DIL
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up,
hon.
FERGUS
Don't call me that.
DIL
Sorry, darling.
FERGUS
Give it over, Dil --
DIL
Apologies, my sweet.
Fergus smiles in spite of himself.
DIL
That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa.
She takes out a thermos and pours him some tea.
FERGUS
You're something else, Dil, you know
that?
DIL
Never said a truer word.
She hands him a neatly cut sandwich.
DIL
See, I was always best looking after
someone. Must be something in the genes.
FERGUS
Must be.
DIL
And the fact that you didn't know is
basically the fault of yours truly. And
even when you were throwing up, I could
tell you cared.
64.
FERGUS
You could?
DIL
Do you care, Jimmy?
FERGUS
Sure I do.
DIL
You mean that?
FERGUS
Yeah. I care, Dil.
She lowers her head.
FERGUS
You crying, Dil?
He removes her glasses and looks at her moist eyes.
DIL
I'm tired and emotional.
Then he hears a voice behind him.
DEVEROUX
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
FERGUS
What?
DEVEROUX
Whatever it is she does for you.
Fergus looks from Dil to Deveroux.
FERGUS
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
DEVEROUX
Consider it how you like. Just get that
bloody tart out of here.
Fergus stands up suddenly. He speaks quietly.
FERGUS
Did you ever pick your teeth up with
broken fingers?
Deveroux stares, suddenly chilled.
65.
DEVEROUX
What's that supposed to mean?
FERGUS
It's a simple question.
Deveroux says nothing. Fergus looks down to Dil.
FERGUS
Come on, dear.
He holds out his arm. Dil gathers up her things and takes it.
Her face is wreathed in a smile.
DIL
He didn't answer, honey --
Fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp.
FRANKNUM
Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.
Dil and Fergus descend from the site in the lift.
DIL
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
FERGUS
Shut up.
DIL
Made me feel all funny inside.
FERGUS
I said stop it.
DIL
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
FERGUS
You think that's wise?
DIL
Nothing's wise.
The lift stops with a thud.
FERGUS
I didn't mean to hit you.
DIL
I know that.
66.
FERGUS
Kind of liked you as a girl.
DIL
That's a start.
FERGUS
So I'm sorry.
DIL
Make it up to me, then.
FERGUS
How?
DIL
Ask to meet me again.
FERGUS
Will you meet me again?
DIL
When?
FERGUS
Whenever. Tonight.
She leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of
catcalls behind him. He watches Dil go as the lift takes him
back up to the site.
Fergus walks into the room and turns on a small desk-light.
Then he hears a voice.
JUDE
Hello, stranger.
69.
He sees Jude sitting in the corner. Her hair is now dark
brown.
JUDE
You vanished.
He stares at her, says nothing.
JUDE
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the
gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
FERGUS
Leave me alone, Jude.
JUDE
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You
never asked what happened.
FERGUS
I heard.
JUDE
Eddie and Tinker died.
FERGUS
I know.
JUDE
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our
teeth. No thanks to you.... What you
think of the hair?
FERGUS
Suits you.
She walks round the room.
JUDE
Aye, I was sick of being blond. Needed a
tougher look, if you know what I mean.
She lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black
leather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch.
JUDE
Fuck me, Fergus.
He takes her hand away.
JUDE
Am I to take it that's a no?
70.
He says nothing.
JUDE
We had a court-martial in your absence.
They wanted to put a bullet in your head.
I pleaded for clemency. Said we should
find out what happened first. So what did
happen?
FERGUS
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back.
I tried to catch him. He made it to the
road and got hit by a Saracen.
JUDE
So you did fuck up.
FERGUS
Yes.
JUDE
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
FERGUS
No, what is the thing?
JUDE
You vanished quite effectively. Became
Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how
useful that could be.
FERGUS
What do you mean?
JUDE
We've got some plans here. And we'll need
a Mister Nobody to execute them.
FERGUS
No way, Jude. I'm out.
JUDE
You're never out, Fergus.
She looks at him hard. He looks away.
JUDE
Maybe you don't care whether you die or
not. But consider the girl, Fergus. The
wee black chick.
He leaps up from the bed.
71.
FERGUS
Leave her out of this.
JUDE
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche.
You know we won't leave her out of this.
But I'm glad to see you care.
She brings her lips close to his so they touch.
JUDE
And I must admit I'm curious.
He grabs her hair and pulls her head back.
FERGUS
What the fuck do you know, Jude?
She pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth.
JUDE
You fucking tell me, boy --
Fergus stares at her. Then says quietly:
FERGUS
She's nobody. She likes me.
JUDE
So I suppose a fuck is out of the
question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No
sudden moves. And not a whisper to her.
You'll be hearing from us.
She kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple.
JUDE
Keep the faith.
She goes. Fergus stands in the darkness.
JUDE
He your boyfriend?
Jude, turning in the chair.
JUDE
Lucky you.
DIL
Carnations.
FERGUS
What?
DIL
He'd bring me carnations.
FERGUS
So I got it wrong, then.
DIL
Not at all, honey.
FERGUS
Don't.
DIL
Okay.
She smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and
sees Jude is there. Fergus stands, suddenly.
He throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog-
marches her out.
FERGUS
Come on.
DIL
Why, honey --
FERGUS
Come on.
DIL
You gonna tell me why?
FERGUS
No.
73.
As they pass Jude, she smiles.
Dil and Fergus making their way to their seats at the bar.
DIL
You gonna tell me what it is?
A figure sitting down at the bar. It is Jude.
JUDE
What was it?
DIL
You know her, Jimmy?
JUDE
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
FERGUS
Dil, this is Jude.
DIL
You following me?
JUDE
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to
you, Dil?
DIL
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
JUDE
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as
they say.
DIL
Absolutely. The younger the better.
Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
74.
JUDE
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
DIL
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
JUDE
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she,
Jimmy?
DIL
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
JUDE
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it.
Isn't that right, James...
She leaves. Dil watches her go.
DIL
It's her, isn't it?
FERGUS
What's her?
DIL
She's the thing you had to tell me.
FERGUS
Kind of.
DIL
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really
sorry.
She looks at Col
DIL
You see that, Col?
COL
Saw it, Dil.
DIL
Fuck it, is what I say.
COL
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
DIL
Fucking men, Col --
75.
COL
Fuck 'em.
There are tears in her eyes. She stands.
DIL
And fuck you, Jimmy --
She staggers out of the pub. Fergus sits there. There is an
expression in Col's eyes that makes Fergus feel very, very
small.
COL
You could always make it up to her.
FERGUS
How?
COL
When a girl runs out like that, she
generally wants to be followed.
FERGUS
She's not a girl, Col --
COL
Whatever you say.
But Fergus rises and walks out.
In the moving car. Jude is driving, Maguire next to her.
Fergus sits in the back.
FERGUS
So it was you all the time.
MAGUIRE
Who'd you think it was?
FERGUS
I thought it was Dave.
MAGUIRE
And who's Dave when he's at home?
FERGUS
He's at home.
MAGUIRE
Should blow you away, you know that?
FERGUS
I know that.
Maguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand, then whacks
him on the teeth with his closed fist.
MAGUIRE
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want
to get fucking emotional -- you
understand, Hennessy?
FERGUS
I understand.
MAGUIRE
Fuck you, too --
Jude drives. Fergus looks through the back window at the
street outside.
JUDE
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
MAGUIRE
That true, Fergus? You in love?
FERGUS
Absolutely.
77.
MAGUIRE
And what's she like between the sheets?
FERGUS
Definitely unusual.
MAGUIRE
And who is she?
FERGUS
Just a girl.
MAGUIRE
And you know what'll happen if you fuck
up again, don't you?
FERGUS
Aye, I do, Peter.
MAGUIRE
Good.
Dil and Fergus standing in the darkness.
DIL
You want another haircut, baby?
FERGUS
No. Sit down.
He sits her down in one of the chairs.
FERGUS
You'd do anything for me?
Dil nods.
DIL
Anything.
Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head
leaps back.
DIL
No way --
83.
FERGUS
You said anything, Dil
DIL
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
FERGUS
Want to change you to a man, Dil...
She stares at him.
DIL
Why?
FERGUS
It's a secret.
DIL
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
FERGUS
Yes.
DIL
And you wouldn't leave me?
FERGUS
No.
DIL
You promise?
FERGUS
I promise.
She takes a breath.
DIL
Go on, then.
Fergus begins to cut.
CLOSE-UP ON DlL'S FACE as her hair is shorn. Tears stream
down her cheeks.
DIL
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
FERGUS
I'm sorry.
But he keeps cutting. He gives Dil a short, cropped military
cut like Jody's.
84.
DIL
You want to make me look like him...
FERGUS
No. Want to make you into something new.
That nobody recognizes...
She looks in the mirror at it in the dark.
DIL
Don't recognize myself, Jimmy.
Dil enters, with her new haircut. She goes to turn on the
light. He stops her hand.
FERGUS
No.
She looks at her hand on his.
FERGUS
Better in the dark.
Her fingers close around his.
DIL
So it's true, then?
FERGUS
What?
DIL
You like me better like this.
FERGUS
Yes.
She brings her lips to his neck. He lets them stay there. His
hands travel up to her blouse. He begins to undo the buttons.
DIL
Oh, Jimmy --
Slowly the blouse slips down, exposing her male torso. She
falls down to her knees and tugs at his belt.
FERGUS
No. No. Dil... get up...
He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. She
stretches languorously down on it.
85.
He unzips her skirt slowly, and draws it off. She turns on
the bed sexily, her face to the mattress. She is wearing
suspender-belts underneath her skirt.
DIL
Baby...
But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe
where the soldier's things are. Dil on the bed, slowly turns.
DIL
What are you doing, honey...
We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with
Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark.
FERGUS
Don't call me that --
DIL
Sorry. What you doing?
Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position.
FERGUS
Try this on, Dil
He wraps the shirt around her.
DIL
Why?
FERGUS
For me.
DIL
For you...
She kisses him.
From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on
a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts
out the cigarette.
Time lapse. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes.
Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on
his coat, and walks out.
Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude.
JUDE
You a handyman, Fergie?
FERGUS
I take pride in my work.
JUDE
I sincerely hope so.
Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something
from the bag.
JUDE
Tools of the trade.
She kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly.
JUDE
And forget about the girl.
Fergus opens what Jude has given him -- looking inside. There
is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth.
Fergus enters. The room is empty. He calls.
FERGUS
Dil?
No reply. He runs outside.
87.
He walks in holding her. Leans her against the wall, then
goes to the window to check the street outside.
She takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey.
FERGUS
You heard what I said, Dil?
DIL
My pills...
She points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the
bathroom.
FERGUS
What pills?
DIL
Prescription. For my condition.
FERGUS
What condition?
89.
DIL
My condition. Ennui.
He goes and gets the pills.
She takes a handful of pills. She drinks from the whiskey
bottle.
FERGUS
Are you supposed to take that many?
DIL
Only in times of extreme stress.
She walks around the room, drinking, then sits down.
DIL
See, they all say good-bye sometime.
'Cept for him.
She looks at the picture of Jody. Then she looks at Fergus.
FERGUS
Are you all right, Dil?
DIL
I will be.
She stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands
between her knees.
DIL
Go on, then.
Fergus walks slowly toward the door.
FERGUS
Good-bye, Dil
DIL
Jimmy?
FERGUS
What?
DIL
Don't go like that.
She looks at him, standing up. Something incredibly
attractive about her.
DIL
Can't help what I am.
90.
He walks slowly toward her. He kisses her, on the lips.
We see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face. Fergus
looks from it to her. She seems to be in a sweet narcotic
haze. She reaches out her hand and strokes his.
DIL
Knew you had a heart...
Fergus sits down on the bed. Dil is lying back on it.
FERGUS
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your
man.
DIL
You knew which man?
FERGUS
Your soldier.
DIL
You knew my Jody?
She still strokes his hand. Her voice is dreamily slurred,
her eyes far away.
FERGUS
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast.
Held him hostage for three days.
DIL
You knew my Jody?
FERGUS
Are you listening?
Dil smiles woozily.
DIL
Yes.
FERGUS
I got the order to shoot him. Before I
could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and
died.
DIL
Died...
FERGUS
Did you hear me?
91.
DIL
You killed my Jody?
FERGUS
In a manner of speaking.
DIL
It was you...
She is not rational. She is smiling, far away somewhere.
FERGUS
You should scream. You should beat my
head off.
She woozily tries to hit him round the face.
DIL
You killed my Jody
FERGUS
No.
DIL
You didn't.
FERGUS
I suppose I tried.
DIL
You tried.
FERGUS
Don't you want to kill me?
Dil raises an unsteady hand and points it at him.
DIL
Bang...
He strokes her cheek. She says very slowly and sleepily
DIL
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me,
too.
FERGUS
Okay.
Her eyes close. She falls into a deep sleep. Fergus looks
down at her, almost fondly.
92.
They are lying on the bed together, fully clothed. Dil wakes.
She rises very quietly and goes to his coat, thrown across a
chair. She searches through the pockets and takes out the
gun.
Jude in bed. An alarm sounds; she reaches to turn it off.
Dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties
them very securely to each corner of the brass bed. She ties
them round both of Fergus's feet, very gently, so as not to
wake him.
Jude, in front of a mirror, getting ready.
She draws one of Fergus's hands up, very gingerly, and ties
that securely to the upright. She ties the other and is
drawing it upward when he wakes. She jerks the silk stocking
so it is secure.
FERGUS
What the fuck --
Dil speaks unnaturally quietly.
DIL
So tell me what you're doing, Jimmy.
Jude, fully dressed. She takes a gun from under the bed and
slips it in her handbag.
Dil crouching beside Fergus, his gun in her hand.
DIL
Didn't really listen last night. I heard
but I didn't listen.
Fergus, staring at her. He tries to pull on the bindings.
93.
DIL
That won't do you no good. Dil knows how
to tie a body.
She stands up, still pointing the gun at Fergus.
DIL
Wondered why you came on to me like that
when you gave me the look.
FERGUS
He asked me to see were you all right.
DIL
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me.
Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
FERGUS
Stop it, Dil --
DIL
Just don't kick Dil and she'll be
touched. Be nice to her and she'll be
yours forever.
She looks at him, tears in her eyes.
DIL
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I
can't do that. Yet.
FERGUS
Let me go, Dil
He drags at his bindings.
DIL
Why?
FERGUS
Got to be somewhere.
DIL
Try and go, then.
94.
Fergus pulls furiously at his bindings.
FERGUS
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or
they'll be here
DIL
Let them come then.
IN THE CAR. OUTSIDE BROTHEL.
JUDE
Can't stay here, Peter -- drive around
once more --
He drives off.
Fergus collapsed back on the bed, exhausted.
DIL
Just want your company for a little while
longer...
Fergus strains and roars from the bed.
FERGUS
You don't know what you're doing, Dil --
95.
DIL
Never did...
MAGUIRE'S POINT OF VIEW -- the brothel door opening. The
elderly judge comes out. The car with his security men guns
up.
MAGUIRE
Give me the shooter, Jude --
JUDE
You're crazy --
MAGUIRE
Give me the fucking shooter!
He grabs it from her pocket. Throws open the door and runs
across the street. Jude dives into the driver's seat.
Fergus, pulling at his bindings.
Dil dressed in the soldier's cricket clothes. She looks like
a sweet little boy. She places a cassette in the tape deck --
"The Crying Game" song. She comes to the bed, and points the
gun at Fergus's head.
DIL
You like me now, Jimmy?
FERGUS
I like you, Dil --
DIL
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
FERGUS
More what?
96.
DIL
More endearments.
FERGUS
I like you, DIl
DIL
Love me.
FERGUS
Yes.
DIL
Tell me you love me.
FERGUS
Whatever you say, Dil.
DIL
Then say it.
FERGUS
Love you, Dil.
DIL
You do?
FERGUS
Yeah.
DIL
What would you do for me?
FERGUS
Anything.
She begins to cry and lays the gun gently on his chest.
DIL
Say it again.
FERGUS
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
She pulls on his bindings to release him.
Dil's face, close to Fergus's, as the stockings that bound
his hands are nearly undone.
DIL
And you'll never leave me?
FERGUS
Never.
DIL
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice
to hear it.
His arm is free. He strokes her hair.
FERGUS
I'm sorry, Dil.
She shudders with weeping. The music of the song plays in the
background.
Jude walking through the open door, arms extended, holding a
gun.
JUDE
You stupid shit -- Once was bad enough.
But twice.
Dil rises from the bed and points her gun at Jude.
DIL
You didn't knock, honey --
Dil fires, hits Jude. Jude falls and is writhing on the
floor.
FERGUS
Dil!
JUDE
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Dil walks closer, holding the gun and pointing it at Jude.
DIL
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
FERGUS
Fergus.
98.
DIL
What's Fergus?
FERGUS
It's my name, Dil --
DIL
What happened to Jimmy?
JUDE
I said get it off me, Fergus --
Jude, on the floor, reaches for her gun. Manages to grab it.
DIL
What's she going to do, Jimmy? She going
to blow you away?
Dil shoots again, like a child, playing with a toy. She hits
Jude in her gun shoulder. Jude spins one way, the gun the
other.
DIL
Was she there too? When you got my Jody?
Fergus screams
FERGUS
Dil!!!
DIL
I asked you a question, honey -- were you
there too --
JUDE
You sick bitch --
As she raises the gun, Dil shoots her repeatedly, saying:
DIL
You was there, wasn't you? You used those
tits and that ass to get him, didn't you?
Fergus screams from the bed. He rips free his other arm. Dil
shoots Jude in the throat, and she falls dead, covered in
blood. Dil turns the gun on Fergus.
DIL
She was there, wasn't she?
99.
FERGUS
She was --
DIL
And she used her tits and that cute
little ass to get him, didn't she?
FERGUS
Yes.
DIL
Tell me what she wore.
FERGUS
Can't remember...
Dil points the gun at him, squeezing on the trigger. Then she
stops.
DIL
Can't do it, Jimmy. He won't let me.
She looks at the picture; walks over and sits down in front
of it.
DIL
You won't let me, Jody --
She raises the gun and places it in her mouth. Fergus takes
it gently from her mouth and places it on the table. He lifts
her up by the shoulders.
FERGUS
You've got to go now, Dil --
DIL
Do I?
FERGUS
Yes. Now.
DIL
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
FERGUS
Not if you go.
DIL
Will I see you again?
FERGUS
You will, Dil
100.
DIL
Promise?
FERGUS
I promise.
DIL
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
FERGUS
The Metro.
DIL
Meet Col --
FERGUS
Yes. Say hello to Col --
He leads her out the door. Fergus goes back into the room,
past Jude's body. Looks out the window to where he can see
Dil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have
gathered. The wail of police sirens coming closer. He watches
Dil run off, with her funny walk. Then looks down and sees
the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the
house. He picks up the gun, wipes it with a rag to remove
Dil's fingerprints. He turns to the picture of the soldier;
talks to it.
FERGUS
You should have stayed at home.
He sits in the chair by the window, waiting.
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE UP to reveal a large interior, with light streaming in
the windows. Large barred doors open and a group of women
come through, with parcels, children in tow, etc. Among them
is Dil, looking resplendent. She walks past the rows of
convicts with their families, up to a glass cage, where
Fergus sits, waiting.
DIL
Got you the multivitamins and the iron
tablets, hon --
FERGUS
Don't call me that --
101.
DIL
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are
magnesium supplement --
FERGUS
Stop it, Dil --
DIL
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm
counting the days. Two thousand three
hundred and thirty-four left.
FERGUS
Thirty-five.
DIL
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the
leap year. What am I supposed to call you
then, Jimmy?
FERGUS
Fergus.
DIL
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life -
-
FERGUS
Please, Dil --
DIL
Can't help it. You're doing time for me.
No greater love, as the man says. Wish
you'd tell me why.
FERGUS
As the man said, it's in my nature.
DIL
What's that supposed to mean?
She shakes her head.
FERGUS
Well, there was this scorpion, you see.
And he wants to go across the river. But
he can't swim. So he goes to this frog,
who can swim, and he says to him, "Excuse
me, Mr. Froggy..."
102.
CAMERA PULLS BACK, and as Fergus tells the story of the
scorpion and the frog, the music comes up -- "Stand By Your
Man."
FADE OUT.
