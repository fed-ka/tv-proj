      Front door slamming open, Lahey rushes down the steps to the 
      yard in time to see Isaac tear into the street on his bike.

                                  LAHEY
                    Isaac!

      Turning for his SUV, Lahey fumbles for his keys, while never 
      noticing the person across the street... Jackson.

      Beside the large trash bins at the end of the driveway to his 
      own house, he watches Lahey s SUV swerve into the road.             TEEN WOLF "Episode 202"PINK DRAFT1/13/124.

      Shoving a plastic bag full of black blood-soaked tissues into 
      the bin, Jackson slams the trash lid shut.


      Lahey steps out of his SUV and into the rain. He makes a 
      cautious approach toward the bike.

                                  LAHEY
                    Isaac?

      He squints through his glasses as they begin to FOG. When he 
      pulls them off, he s able to see--

      A FIGURE. 

      Standing in the middle of the alley. Blurry to his eyes, but 
      clearly a person.

                                  LAHEY (CONT D)
                    Isaac?

      The figure doesn t move. Lahey wipes his glasses on his 
      shirt. But the moment he slips them on again, the figure 
      disappears. All Lahey sees now is an empty alley.

                                  LAHEY (CONT D)
                    Okay, that s enough. Let s go!

      Rain still falling, Lahey can barely see through his fogged 
      lenses. He yanks the glasses off to wipe them clean again.

                                  LAHEY (CONT D)
                    Come on, grab your bike and let s 
                    go!

      When he glances back up, he sees the blurry figure has 
      returned. But it s now SEVERAL FEET CLOSER.            TEEN WOLF "Episode 202"PINK DRAFT1/13/125.

      Rain dripping over his face, Lahey tries to make out the 
      details of the person.

                                  LAHEY (CONT D)
                    Isaac?

      With a trembling hand, he holds his glasses up to squint 
      through the lenses.

      But now there s nothing there. Confused, Lahey glances above 
      the lenses, seeing only a milky blur. Then, holding the 
      glasses out, he slowly lowers them...

      THE FIGURE is still there. It s just now on ALL FOURS. And 
      it s creeping stealthily forward.

      Stepping back, Lahey pulls the glasses closer to his eyes, 
      fitting them over his nose and--

      Now he sees it.

                                  LAHEY (CONT D)
                    Holy...

      He staggers into a terrified retreat, spinning around and 
      rushing for his SUV as--

      SOMETHING MOVES with alarming speed, bounding towards him. 
      Just as Lahey is about to slam the door shut, the THING grabs 
      it from the other side, pulling back. 

      Lahey gropes for a tighter hold, trying to pull the door 
      closed. It s a desperate, frantic tug-of-war that ends with a 
      METALLIC WRENCHING.

      THE DOOR tears right off its hinges. WHIPPING into the air, 
      it SLAMS against the alley wall and clatters to the ground.

      Lahey SHRIEKS, a high-pitched scream that abruptly cuts 
      short. BLOOD spatters over the cement. It s quickly dissolved 
      by the soft patter of rain from above where--

      THE NEARLY FULL MOON shines brightly through ominous storm 
      clouds.

      glance back, she hurries to her car parked in the driveway.            TEEN WOLF "Episode 202"PINK DRAFT1/13/126.



      A BEAM OF LIGHT cuts through the darkness. Using her phone as 
      a flashlight, Allison wanders out of the woods and into the 
      clearing overlooking the town. 

      Her breath catches when the light reflects off a PAIR OF EYES 
      like those of an animal. But it s only Scott.

      Pulling him closer, Allison calms him as only she can do. 
      With a kiss. Cheeks touching, lips brushing against lips, 
      they speak between kisses.

      Pulling his helmet on, Scott starts toward the goal. But he 
      stops when he reaches the Defender. Then, as casually as he 
      can, he leans over and takes a DEEP BREATH IN.

      The bewildered Defender turns to Scott. He gives the Defender 
      an awkward smile, then steps into goal.

      in line. The Defender braces for the attack when--

      Scott races right past him, SLAMMING INTO THE PLAYER. They 
      both CRASH to the ground, lacrosse ball bouncing away.

      Helping the player to his feet, Scott pulls him close to take 
      a few quick SNIFFS. Then with a look of disappointment, lets

      Stunned, Matt tries to disentangle himself from Scott who 
      hangs onto him long enough to grab a quick whiff.

      Scott go SOARING PAST in a blur.

      Another WHISTLE BLOW. The Defender now just stands there, 
      lacrosse stick propped on the ground as Scott hurtles by, 
      crashing into another player.

      Mystified, Coach turns to Stiles.

                    again and you ll be doing suicide 
                    runs until you die. You ll be the 
                    first ever suicide run to actually 
                    end in suicide. Got it?

                                  SCOTT
                    Yes, Coach!

      Now quite worried, Scott notices Jackson at the head of line, 
      watching him with curiosity.

      Whistle between his teeth, Coach prepares to pass a ball to 
      Jackson when the boy lowers his stick to the ground.

                                    JACKSON
                    Coach, my shoulder s hurting. I m 
                    going to sit this one out.

      Scott and Stiles share a nervous look. Jackson steps out of 
      line, never taking his suspicious gaze off Scott.

                                  COACH
                    Next!

      The player now at head of the line steps forward, helmet 
      turning up to reveal--

      Isaac. 

      Scott cocks his head as if already sensing something 
      different. Teeth clenched and gasping tight breaths, Isaac 
      looks strangely animal, almost feral.

      THE WHISTLE BLOWS. Coach tosses the ball to Isaac. He catches 
      it without even looking and CHARGES forward.

      The Defender darts in with vicious slaps at Isaac s stick. 
      But the boy spins and parries around him with ease.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 202"PINK DRAFT1/13/1217.

      Scott comes out of the goal to meet him. They COLLIDE 
      BRUTALLY, the sound of plastic gear CRACKING like thunder.

      Hitting the ground, Isaac and Scott look up to find 
      themselves face-to-face. Staring at each other with GLOWING 
      YELLOW EYES. 

      Both of them.

      Coach BLOWS THE WHISTLE, snapping them back to the present. 
      Eyes dimming to normal, Scott notices the other players now 
      looking away to the edge of the field where--

      SHERIFF STILINSKI and TWO DEPUTIES approach from the school.

                                  ISAAC
                          (a whisper)
                    Don t tell them.

      Scott turns to Isaac. Eyes having returned to normal, he now 
      looks like any other frightened teenager all too aware of the 
      serious trouble he s in.

      FADE IN:


      Gathered at the benches, the players whisper about what s 
      going on with Isaac who remains on the field talking to 
      Stilinski, his Deputies and Coach.

      Off to the side, Stiles and Scott huddle together.

                                  STILES
                    Can you hear them?

      Nodding, Scott focuses in on Stilinski s voice.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Your father s body was found last 
                    night in his car. I m terribly 
                    sorry. And as hard as this is, we 
                      unfortunately need to ask you some 
                    difficult questions.

                                  SCOTT
                    His father s dead.

                                  STILES
                    Are you kidding?

      They watch a shell-shocked Isaac give an oddly restrained 
      reaction to the news.

                                  SCOTT
                          (still listening)
                    They think he was murdered.

      Stiles watches Stilinski and his Deputies begin guiding Isaac 
      off the field.

                                  STILES
                    Did they say he s a suspect?

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t think so. Why?

                                  STILES
                    Because they can lock him in a 
                    holding cell for 24 hours.

                          (nodding to Isaac)
                    He does.

      At the entrance to the school, Isaac gives a final, fearful 
      glance back as the doors CLANG shut.


      The doors of the school SLAM open. Scott charges down the 
      steps and into the parking lot to find he s too late.

      The Deputy Sheriff cars are already pulling away. But then he 
      spots Isaac in the back of one car. They connect eyes for 
      only a moment. And then he s gone.

      Defeated, Scott slowly steps back, turning for the school 
      when--

      A BLACK CAMARO skids to a halt in front of him. Derek looks 
      out from behind the wheel.

                    to call a lawyer. Because a lawyer

      Standing outside Jackson s front door, Matt grips a CAMERA 
      BAG with both hands, unwilling to hand it over.

                                  MATT
                    I m starting to feel a little weird 
                    about this.

                                    JACKSON
                    No, what you re feeling is a 
                    hundred dollars richer.

      He fits a wad of TWENTIES into Matt s shirt pocket.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Now give me the camera and go buy

                      photography geeks a hard-on.

      He reaches for the camera, but Matt pulls back.

                    This doesn t have anything to do

                                    JACKSON

      Jackson slams the door closed. After a moment, Matt steps 
      back and heads down the walkway to his car. He briefly looks 
      up to Isaac s house across the street, noticing the front 
      door blocked off with YELLOW POLICE TAPE. 

      One thing he does not notice, however, is the BLACK CAMARO 
      parked down the street.


      Clouds push rapidly across the darkening sky as the FULL MOON 
      rises inexorably higher, growing brighter and brighter.


      Stepping out of the SUV, the Hunter walks around to the front 
      passenger-side tire to discover a bizarre sight.

      There is an ARROW sticking out of the tire. 

        Incredulous, he looks to rear tire, which also has an arrow 
      sticking out of it. Both tires are rapidly deflating. 

      He turns, looking around to the shadows when--

      AN ARROW SOARS out of the darkness and goes right into his 
      leg. The Hunter CRIES out in pain and staggers to his knees.

      SEVERAL YARDS AWAY - Allison lowers a bow. Breathless, she 
      eyes her handiwork with satisfaction. But when the Hunter 
      whips his head up to her direction, she ducks back into the 
      shadows.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 202"PINK DRAFT1/13/1236.

      Gritting his teeth, the Hunter snaps the arrow shaft from his

      Stiles and Derek approach the station. Through the windows 
      they can see the Night Officer sitting behind the front desk.
