                                      ACT ONE

  INT. JULES  KITCHEN - MORNING (DAY ONE)11

  JULES checks her reflection in a spoon.  ELLIE (dressed for 
  tennis) and ANDY drink coffee.  

                              JULES
                    No, no, no!  I can t afford another 
                    stress crease!  I m going to end up 
                    looking permanently concerned.  

                              ELLIE
                    I m sure it ll go away.

                              JULES
                    You don t understand -- my skin is 
                    like linen pants.  One time I slept 
                    on a pillow wrong, and I had a line 
                    on my cheek for two weeks. 
                      (then)
                    Hey, Andy, I need your help.  

                              ANDY
                      (mid sip, chokes)
                    Anything!

                              ELLIE
                    Wha?  Why are you calling in the B-
                    Team when I m right here?

                              JULES
                    It s about Bobby-

                              ELLIE
                    All yours.

                              JULES
                    Things got weird with us after I-

                              ANDY
                    Hit it and quit it?

                              JULES
                    No, after I gently explained in 
                    detail how it was meaningless sex and 
                    our marriage is officially dead.  
                    God, when you say it out loud it 
                    sounds horrible.  So, could you go 
                    check on him so I can stop worrying?    Cougar Town            "TBD"  [114]                   2.

                              ANDY
                    Wild horses couldn t keep me from 
                    this.  
                      (quickly to Ellie)
                    May I please?

                              ELLIE
                    Go.
                      (Andy hustles out, Ellie rises)
                    I m off to my tennis lesson.  But 
                    when I get back, clear your schedule 
                    for  Ellie Day .  Where team Ellie 
                     n  Jules go to Costco like the old 
                    days, and you wait in line while I 
                    shop.  After that, we ll expose Stan 
                    to the kid next door so he can get 
                      chickenpox out of the way.  And then 
                    if there s time, we ll take my duvet 
                    to dry cleaners. 

                              JULES
                    I would love to spend a day devoted 
                    to your errands, but I have way too 
                    much on my plate.  

                              ELLIE
                    Your loss.  A child only gets 
                      chickenpox once, Jules.  

  Ellie s phone rings and a picture of CHRISTIAN pops up.

                              JULES
                    Holy face jock!  Who is that?!

                              ELLIE
                    Remember Christian, my tennis pro 
                    slash fake boyfriend?  This is him.  
                    Whenever I accidentally get a glimpse 
                    of Andy s hairy sasquatch tush, I use 
                    Christian to cleanse the palet.

  Ellie tries to answer the phone, but Jules smacks her hand.  

                              JULES
                    Don t answer it!  I m trying to 
                    remember those bedroom eyes.    

                              ELLIE
                    That s actually a bad picture of him. 

                              JULES
                    That s bad?!  Please show me more.    Cougar Town            "TBD"  [114]                   3.

  Jules scrolls through pictures, then sees a saucy one.  She 
  erects her fingers like nipples hardening.

                              JULES
                    Byooop.

  INT. GRAY S PUB - LATER22

  Andy enters.  Grayson and Bobby (with a mustache) are there. 

                              ANDY
                    Bobby...  I ve been looking for you.  
                    Are you okay?  

                              BOBBY
                    Why wouldn t I be?  The Jules thing?  
                      I appreciate the concern, but I m a 
                    free man.  The divorce is official.  

                              GRAYSON
                    I think it was official before.

                              BOBBY
                    But now it s officially legal.  

                              GRAYSON
                    I feel like it was legal before, too.

                    The bottom line is that I ve moved 
                    on.  I took all the bad vibes and 
                    turned them into this mustache.

                    For sure.

                              BOBBY
                    C mon, Andy.  There s going to be a 
                    lot of people, so I need help

                    Trust me, I m in a horrible mood and 
                    I d love to beer-bong it away, but 
                    I m not sure that s a good idea.  

                              GRAYSON
                    You still feel weird?  Relax, nothing 
                    happened between us.

                    I was there, Grayson and something

                    Laurie, it never happened.  We never

                    Then why do I feel so bad?  I never 
                    feel guilty.  I mean, one time I 
                      accidentally replaced my cousin s

                    left with a tennis racquet and her 
                    make up bag.

                    Mmm, Trav, you smell yummy, like 
                    you re made of wood... And cologne.

                    Yeah, I try and smell nice for m girl 
                    Kylie because she is a catcheroni.

                    I m already in a bad mood, and then 
                    you didn t even notice that I was 
                    giving you my best B-plus flirting?!  

                                TRAVIS
                    Sorry, I just didn t think it was a 
                    good idea to flirt in front of my 
                      girlfriend.

                                LAURIE
                    See, that s why you re such an 
                    awesome kid.  You always do the right

                    But it was still a good idea.  Even 
                    after the stitches, it basically paid 
                    for itself.

                    Ellie, you re my favorite wife!  
                    Also, quick question: is it dangerous 
                    to pee on a car battery--

                              ELLIE (O.S.)

                    Just the police warning us about a

                      (off Ellie s concern)
                    They re a friendly gang.  More like a

                    If you had barged in ten minutes ago, 
                    it would ve been very embarrassing 
                    for both of us.  Why are you here?

                    That s easy for you to say, but my 
                    life is a string of bad decisions, 
                    like buying that cheap-ass margarita

                                TRAVIS

                    never be with?  That would be crazy.

                    Exactly.  And, I m sorry for being a 
                    B-word before.  Tennis is supposed to

                              BOBBY
                    Never a question.  See you tonight...
                      (for Grayson s benefit)
                    Friend.  

  After Bobby crosses off, Andy turns to Grayson:

                              ANDY
                    What s the matter?  Can t hang on? 

                              GRAYSON
                    It s  can t hang , jackass.  And 
                    that s not the issue.  You re holding 
                    Bobby s hand while he hits rock 
                    bottom.  Granted, it s not a very far 
                    fall for him, but still.    

                              ANDY
                    Come on, he s just riding the wave.  

                              GRAYSON
                    I ve been where Bobby is.  He s 
                    burying his pain under a mountain of 
                    partying.  After Vivian left, I 
                    buried my pain under a mountain of 
                    young girls.  I m still doing it.  
                    Not a good example-- my life s 
                    actually pretty awesome.  But Bobby s 
                    isn t.  He s in trouble, and if you 
                    keep partying with him and he doesn t 
                    deal with this, he s going to go even 
                    deeper into a dark place where we 
                    might not be able to get him back.

  Andy watches Bobby brush his teeth, then rinse his mouth 
  with a hose.  Saddened, Andy hangs his head.  The word 
   BALD  is written on his scalp in marker.  Grayson chuckles. 

                              ANDY
                    What?

                              GRAYSON
                    Nothing.

                                                                              CUT TO:

                      (then, to Christian)
                      Christian, do you think next week we 
                    could meet for a private lesson?  I d 
                    really like to focus on my form.

                    I m sorry you had to hear that.  But 
                    it would be unfair to deprive 
                    Christian of this-- 
                      (re: herself)
                    If that s what he wants.  

                                CHRISTIAN
                    Excuse me, Jules?  I m not supposed 
                    to go out with clients, but... Do you 
                    wanna grab a pizza sometime?  

                              JULES
                    I ve had better invitations, but 
                    sure, I d love to.  
                      (he exits, then to Ellie)
                    Hey, Ellie, do you think he s going 
                    to use the money you pay him for your 
                       one-on-one time , to take me out on 
                    a date?  Mmmm.  I can already taste 
                    that pizza.  You know what it tastes 
                    like?  Victory.  How about that?

                              ELLIE
                      (saddened, walking off)
                    I hope you two have fun.  

                              JULES
                    Dammit, Ellie.  Winning isn t any fun 
                    when the other person s sad.  
                      (then, packing stuff)
                    Look, let s grab lunch and talk.  
                    Just don t get all dramatic on me and 
                    leave--
                      (then, realizing)
                    Ellie?!  Oh, come on!

  Jules turns to see Ellie s car pulling away.

  INT. ELLIE S KITCHEN - DAY (DAY THREE)2323

  Ellie is sipping wine when Jules bursts in.  Ellie, icily:   

                              ELLIE
                    Oh, hello there.  

                              JULES
                    So, you strand me at the tennis court 
                    but you re going to play it all, 
                     Ellie been done wrong.   Well say 
                    hello to,  Jules been done right.   
                    Not  done  as in  sex  done, 
                    Christian just gave me a ride home.  
                    He actually doesn t have a car, so we 
                    rode the bus.  But he held my hand 
                    the whole way, so there.

                              ELLIE
                    I don t think I m talking to you yet.  

                              JULES
                    Come on, Ellie, we both know if you 
                    weren t married Christian would ve 
                    asked you out a long time ago.  
                    You re hot.  Plus, you ve got, like, 
                    perfect calves.  From the knees down 
                    you re like a Caucasian Eva Mendes.

                              ELLIE
                    I know that.  But I m still mad.  

                              JULES
                    If it makes you feel better I won t 
                    go out with Christian.

                              ELLIE
                    Don t you get it?  This isn t about 
                      Christian.  This is about us, but the 
                    fact that you don t see it is exactly 
                    what s wrong with our friendship.  

  Ellie stands up to go, but Jules blocks her.

                              JULES
                    Oh, no, no, no.  You can t drop a 
                    bomb like that and then just run off.  

  Ellie BOLTS out of the room.  Jules hauls gluteus after her.

                    Thank you for waking me up.  I was 
                    hoping I could experience more of 
                    this hangover.

  Ellie sprints by in the background followed by Jules.

                              JULES
                    Get back here, Ellie! 

                              ANDY
                      (regards that a beat, then:)
                    Anyway, I think you re right about 
                    Bobby.  You should tell him he s out 
                    of control.  

                              GRAYSON
                    He won t listen to me.  I judge him 
                    all the time.  It has to come from 
                    someone who supports him no matter 
                    what.  You re the idiot that gave him 
                    seed money for  Chippy Chippy Bang

                              ANDY
                    They didn t really explode, Grayson.  
                    They were just peanuts covered in Pop 
                    Rocks, and they were a good idea. 

                              GRAYSON
                    They really weren t.

                              ANDY
                    I know.  How am I supposed to look 
                    Sir Cobb-A-Lot in the face and tell 
                    him there s a chink in his armor?  

                              GRAYSON
                    While you ponder that, what can you 
                    tell me about this?  
                      (reveals chest:  SEACREST OUT )
                    Why won t it come off in the shower?

                    probably start getting used to it.

  Ellie runs around a group of playing KIDS.  Jules barrels

                    And hurdles!

  The next few shots show Jules chasing Ellie down sidewalks, 
  through yards -- maybe even passing a shocked ROBBIE (the 
  kid Jules chased in the pilot).  Jules is about to catch 
  Ellie when Ellie takes a knee, as if she were injured.

                    Oh my gosh, are you okay?

  Suddenly Ellie throws sand from a sandbox in Jules  face.  
  Jules wipes the sand away as Ellie runs around a corner.

    inflatable kiddie pool with a hose.  Suddenly, Jules runs 
  into frame and tackles Ellie into the pool.

  Still dripping wet, Jules and Ellie sit in the kitchen.

                    I can t believe you pushed me into a 
                    pool.  This top is dry-clean only.  

                              JULES
                    I was there when you bought it.  

                              ELLIE
                    Not this top.  You were  too busy  so 
                    nobody was around to tell me that my 
                    birthmark peeks out when I raise my 
                    arms.

                              JULES
                      (as Ellie demonstrates)
                    Yeah, you shouldn t do that. 

                              ELLIE
                    Jules, you haven t been around for a 
                    lot of stuff lately.  Ever since you 
                    got divorced, everything has been all 
                    about you.  

                              JULES
                    Ellie, I m sorry.  But you don t 
                      understand what it s like to be a 
                    woman my age back out in the world--

                              ELLIE
                    Oh my God, enough!  No one wants to 
                    hear about how you re forty and 
                    single anymore!  Can I kiss a guy in 
                    public?  Can I have my twenties in my 
                    forties?  We re tired of it!

                              JULES
                    Totally tired?

                              ELLIE
                    Fine, not totally.  It s fun to live 
                    through you when you re trying to 
                    figure out, say, which sex position

                    My point is, lately I feel like I m 
                    just a participant in your life.  You 
                    use to always be there for everybody.  
                    But yesterday I asked you to do an 
                     Ellie Day  with me, and you blew it 
                    off.  Old Jules wouldn t have done 
                    that.  New Jules only wanted to hang 
                    out when she found out a guy was 
                    involved.  I get that it s hard to be 
                    where you re at in your life right 
                    now, but I have to be honest, its 
                    turned you a little--

                              JULES
                    Don t say the  J  word.  I hate it.

                    It s turned you a little selfish.

  Ellie exits, squishing in her shoes, leaving Jules alone.

                    time it was to catch Dale cheating, 
                    another time it was because Dale came 
                    home when I was cheating.  I m in

                    I should clarify -- being in here is 
                      terrifying, but you could have just 
                    sold Dale s stuff, or thrown it away.

                    Hey, Kylie.  It s totally my fault 
                    Travis is late.  I dragged him to 
                    this guy Dale s place to get my stuff 
                    back, which I did, but I also kind of 
                    stole Dale s dirt bike trophy.  But 
                    then Dale showed up.  Travis is tough 
                    and all, but Dale could totally take 
                    him with nunchucks and such, so we 
                    had to hide in the closet.  But I m 
                    totally over Dale now and it s all 
                    thanks to Travis, so you should 
                    probably give him some because he s 
                    basically a mega-hero stud.  

                              KYLIE
                    Wow, Travis.  Sounds like you should 
                    get a medal or something.  

                                TRAVIS
                    What can I say?  Helping people is my 
                      anti-drug.  

                              KYLIE
                    Okay, cool.  Thanks, Laurie.  
                      (Laurie exits, then to Travis)
                    I know you want to sleep with her.
