      Molly ENTERS, still in her GOWN, carrying her DIPLOMA.  

                        DANKATRINA
      There she is!Congratulations, Sweetie.

                                  MOLLY
                    Thanks.  

      She steps out of her gown and tosses her DIPLOMA aside.

                                  DAN
                    Careful with that, it s our proof.  

                                    KATRINA
                    So I was thinking, I d make one of 
                    your favorite lunches.
                          (re: take-out menus)
                    Hunan Taste, Thai Taste, or Taste 
                    of India?

                                  MOLLY
                    Sorry, I gotta bounce again.  Can 
                    someone drop off this gown for me? 

                                    KATRINA
                    Of course.  Dad ll return it.  

                                  DAN
                    Sure, seems like something that 
                    should be my responsibility.  
                    Where s the cap? 

                                  MOLLY
                    Somewhere on Wilshire.  I threw it 
                    out Tina s sun roof.  

                                  DAN
                    There was a forty dollar deposit.

                                    KATRINA
                    She was having fun.  Don t worry 
                    about it, Mol.    

                                  DAN
                    Where on Wilshire, exactly?

                                  MOLLY
                    Thanks Mom.  See ya later.                                                                                   4.


      And she s GONE.  Dan turns to Katrina, GRINNING.  

                                  DAN
                    She s Arizona State s problem now.

                                    KATRINA
                    Come on.  We re gonna miss her.  

                                  DAN
                    Is that why I can t stop smiling?

                                    KATRINA
                    Dan, I know she s been a challenge 
                    at times...  

                                  DAN
                    When has she not been a challenge?     

                                    KATRINA
                    Knott's Berry Farm.  

      Katrina grabs a PHOTO of a much younger Dan and Katrina 
      flanking little MOLLY on a carousel, everyone HAPPY.

                                  DAN
                    We did used to have fun there. 

                                    KATRINA
                    Look at her little face.  So happy. 

                                  DAN
                    Yup.  Then that kid left us, and 
                    the big, angry one tagged in.  

                                    KATRINA
                    I wish we d had just one more day 
                    at Knott's Berry Farm.  

                                  DAN
                    I can t give you Knott's Berry 
                    Farm.  But I ve got something even 
                    better.  The second she leaves for 
                    the nation s leading party school--  

                                    KATRINA
                    I know, the big renaissance...

                                  DAN
                    Exactly.  We are gonna get back to 
                    us.  We ll get in shape...
                          (off Katrina s glare)
                    I ll get in shape...                                                                                     5.


                                    KATRINA
                    We can start going to yoga again.   

                                  DAN
                    Yoga.  Ballroom dancing -- except 
                    not that.  Sex: we re gonna be 
                    having sex constantly.  I ll invent 
                    some kind of tandem pants we can 
                    wear so we won t have to stop doing 
                    it when we re out in public.

                                    KATRINA
                    We do need to sex it up a bit more.  
                    I know I haven t exactly been the 
                    Giving Tree lately.    

                                  DAN
                    Two weeks ago, last time we did it. 

                                    KATRINA
                    That long?  Are you sure?

                                  DAN
                    It was a Monday, we had Thai Taste 
                    for dinner, and the Dodgers beat 
                    the Cubs in extra innings.

                                    KATRINA
                    And yet you can t remember to renew 
                    the car insurance.  

                                  DAN
                    You know what?  Let s right the 
                    ship here and now.  Shirts off.    

                                    KATRINA
                    I m not feeling it, Honey.  I m 
                    still a little under the weather.

                                  DAN
                    But I said  shirts off.   That s a 
                    verbal contract.  

                                    KATRINA
                    Sorry.  I m gonna go lie down.  

      She KISSES him non-arousingly, then HEADS upstairs.  

                                  DAN
                    This is no way to start a 
                      renaissance.                                                                                     6.



      At this bustling bagel/sandwich shop, Dan SITS at a table, 
      eating a BAGEL and COFFEE, and reading emails.  

                                  CHUEY (O.S.)
                     Scuse me.

      Dan looks up; Chuey is there.  There s some TENSION here.  

                                  DAN
                    What is it?                                                                                   10.


                                  CHUEY
                    I think you know.

      Chuey points to a SIGN: NO OUTSIDE FOOD OR DRINK.   

                                  DAN
                    What about it?

                                  CHUEY
                    How s the coffee?

                                  DAN
                    Fine.  Robust.

                                  CHUEY
                    Good.  I m glad...  Wouldn t be 
                    from Starbucks, would it?

                                  DAN
                    No.  

                                  CHUEY
                    Then I guess it s a coincidence I 
                    found this in the trash...

      Chuey holds up a STARBUCKS cup.

                                  DAN
                    Not mine.

                                  CHUEY
                          (re: name on cup)
                    No?  Your name s not Dan?

                                  DAN
                    Common name.  
                          (busted)
                    Fine, you solved the case.  You 
                    cracked it wide open.  

                                  CHUEY
                    You actually snuck it in, switched 
                    cups and then lied about it?  
                          (shaking head)
                    Cold blooded...

                                  DAN
                    Yes, it was all an unsuccessful 
                    attempt to avoid this.  Look, as 
                    I ve told you many times, it s 
                    nothing personal; I happen to 
                    prefer Starbucks coffee.                                                                                   11.


                                  CHUEY
                    Then go there and drink it.  Maybe 
                    they got a nice Norah Jones CD for 
                    you at the counter...  

                                  DAN
                    I m not a Norah Jones fan.  
                          (then)
                    Not her new stuff, anyway.  

                                  CHUEY
                    Just so I know, what other rules 
                    don t apply to you?

                                  DAN
                    Look, every day for months, I ve 
                    come in here and spent money.  Does 
                    it really matter if I bring my own 
                    coffee?  

                                  CHUEY
                    Just tryin  to run my business.  Do 
                    I go upstairs to your orthodontics 
                    office and sneak in my own braces?  

                                  DAN
                    Here s a thought.  Maybe serve the 
                    bagels without the giant side of 
                    shoulder chip.  

                                  CHUEY
                    It s my lucky day.  Got a free 
                    lecture on business management from 
                    a dude with sunglasses on his head.

                                  DAN
                    I need them, with all the sunshine 
                    radiating from your personality.  

                                  CHUEY
                    Sorry I lack the charm of someone 
                    who s a known smuggler and a liar.

                                  DAN
                          (getting up)
                    I don t need this.  From now on, 
                    I ll go three blocks out of my way 
                    for the friendly service and 
                    passable food at Bernie s Bagels!  

      As Dan EXITS...                                                                                 12.


                                  CHUEY
                          (calling after)
                    I ll call Bernie and warn him! 


      Dan ENTERS, holding some BROCHURES.  Katrina MEETS him.

                                  DAN
                    Wife!  Look what I ordered...

                    On September 2nd at ten AM, Molly 
                    leaves for ASU.  At 10:30, her room 
                    becomes our home gym.  

      Katrina SMILES, gives Dan a big KISS.  

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Are we about to end a drought?

                                    KATRINA
                    Molly s upstairs.  But tonight, 
                    I ll be on you like...  tourists, 
                    on line to...  get a map.    

                                  DAN
                    See, that kind of odd sexy talk?  
                    That s how you start a renaissance.  

      As Dan goes in for another KISS, Molly ENTERS from upstairs.  
      She STEELS herself...  

                                  MOLLY
                    Mom, Dad, I m gonna have a baby.  

      Dan and Katrina stand there, SHOCKED.

                                  DAN
                    You re pregnant?  
                          (Molly nods)
                    Pregnant?   Pregnant  is a word 
                    that currently describes you?!

                                    KATRINA
                    Dan, calm down.  Molly, how the f-- 
                    how did this happen?  

                                  MOLLY
                    Well, I have a boyfriend...                                                                                  13.


                                    KATRINA
                    Wow.  I distinctly remember talking 
                    this past New Year s about how you

                          (pointed)
                      Apparently, she shares some things.

                    Called for?  Really?

                                  MOLLY
                    Sorry, Mom.  But his name s Junior, 
                    and we totally love each other, and  
                    he s like the best guy I ve ever 
                    gone out with.

                    I don t know, the drummer with the 
                    dinner plates in his earlobes set 
                    the bar pretty high.

                                  MOLLY
                    Don t compare him to Ominous.  That 
                    was just a summer fling.  But with 
                    Junior, I mean, I ve never felt 
                    this way before.  It s real.

                    Oh, it s real.  Super!  
                          (to Katrina)
                    I don t even know what to say.    

                                  MOLLY
                    Look, I know you guys are mad...

                                    KATRINA
                    I think that s fair to say.

                    I m not that irresponsible.

                    You know what?  This is the last 
                    thing I m ever telling you.  
                          (starts out, then)
                    Oh, Junior and his parents are 
                    gonna be here for dinner at six.  

      Molly EXITS.  Katrina CALLS after her.

                                    KATRINA
                    We are not done discussing this!

                                  DAN
                    This is how she rewards us for 
                    giving her her space.   

                                    KATRINA
                    Dan, I d love to talk more, but I m 
                    as upset as you are, and now I ve 
                    got to go pull a dinner out of my 
                    ass.


      The living room is EMPTY; we hear:

                                  CHUEY (O.S.)
                    He s coming.  

                                    LISETTE (O.S.)
                    This is ridiculous.

                                  DEMETRIO (O.S.)
                    Epically lame, Dad.  

      Junior ENTERS, looks around, CALLS OFF:

                                  JUNIOR
                    Ma?  Dad here yet?  I need to talk 
                    to you guys.    

      Chuey, Lisette and Demetrio ENTER, dressed head-to-toe in 
      Stanford apparel: Sweats, sweatshirts, ball caps...  Chuey 
      WHISTLES; a bulldog SAUNTERS in, wearing a Stanford HOODIE.                                                                                   15.


                                  CHUEY
                    Wasn t easy to get him in it.  
                    Shoulda gone up a size.  

                                  JUNIOR
                    This was totally...  unnecessary.    

                                  CHUEY
                    It s what proud families do.

                                    LISETTE
                    What did you want to talk about?

      Junior surveys all the gear, and the PRIDE on Chuey s face.  

                                  JUNIOR
                    Um...  It can wait. 

                                    LISETTE
                    Okay.  Then we ll go change, and 
                    head over to finally meet Molly s 
                    parents.

                                  CHUEY

                    red.  You know, Stanford red.


      THE DOORBELL RINGS.  Katrina CROSSES to the door and opens 
      it, revealing Chuey, Lisette and Junior.  

                                    KATRINA
                    Welcome.  I m Katrina Yoder.

                    Lisette.  I made some dessert.

      She hands Katrina a DISH as Molly and Dan APPROACH their 
      guests.  Dan and Chuey LOCK EYES. 

                                  DAN
                    You are absolutely kidding me.

      On Dan and Chuey s CHAGRIN, and the others  confusion...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      Everyone as BEFORE.  Chuey and Dan GLARE at each other.

                    This is a joke, right?

                                    LISETTE
                    What s going on?

                    Okay, clearly there s some history 
                    here.  But I m sure we can all be--

                                  DAN
                    Four million people in LA, this is

                    What?!

                                  MOLLY
                    You didn t tell them?!

                                  JUNIOR
                      I intended to.  Which I realize is 
                    not the same thing.   

                                  MOLLY
                    But you were all,  They re my best

                    My dad put a Stanford hoodie on our 
                    dog.  It threw me!

                    Junior, you sure this baby s yours?                                                                                   17.

                    Are you sure it s his?

                    How do you know it s her fault?  

                                  CHUEY
                     Cause we raised Junior right.  
                    Man, look at him:  Valedictorian.  
                    Stanford.  Gonna be a scientist.  

                                  DAN
                    And Molly s going to ASU.  After 
                    which, well, at one point, there 
                    was vague talk of something in the 
                    area of concert promotion.  Until 
                    your son did his thing.   

                                    KATRINA
                    Okay, let s change the tone here.  
                    I m sure Molly and Junior have 
                    talked about how they re going to 
                    make this work.  Maybe they d like 
                    to fill us in?  

                                  MOLLY
                    Instead of ASU, I ll do community 
                    college, and live at home.

                    And you, Junior?

                                  JUNIOR
                    I m, um...  going to defer my 
                    Stanford admission indefinitely.

                                  CHUEY
                    I need to sit down.

                                  DAN
                    Don t recall inviting you to.

                    Dad, I can go to UCLA.  And for 
                    money, I plan to tutor.  Math, 
                    science, and SAT prep.                                                                                 18.

                    ears with Tina at the mall.   

                                  DAN
                    Who re we kidding?  We all know the 
                    burden of raising this kid s gonna 
                    fall squarely on your mom and me.  

                                  CHUEY
                    What,  cause the poor Latinos won t 
                    be able to contribute?  

                                    KATRINA
                    Dan didn t mean that.

                                  MOLLY
                    Way to paint a whole ethnic group

                    Whoa, when did this become about me 
                    having some issue with Latinos?
                          (re: Chuey)
                    I have an issue with this Latino.

                    We re done here.
                          (grabbing dish, to Dan)
                    You don t get blondies.

      The Hernandezes EXIT behind Chuey.  Dan EXITS upstairs, 
      followed by Katrina, leaving the evening in RUINS.


      Chuey ENTERS, arms full of Stanford apparel.  He APPROACHES a 
      CLERK and dumps the stuff on the COUNTER.

                                  CHUEY
                    Need to return this...

                                  CLERK
                    Reason for return?

                    I have a boy; he s everything to 
                    me.  He woulda been the first 
                    person in his family to go to 
                    college.  Not just any college, 
                    Stanford!  When I was his age, I 
                    hadn t even heard a Stanford.

                    Didn t know there was a place where 
                    knowledge grew on trees, just 
                    waitin  to be picked.  But my boy 
                    was gonna be one of those young 
                    people, pickin  knowledge off those 
                    beautiful trees.  Then, in one 
                    moment, a dream evaporates. 
                          (re: dog hoodie)
                    And this one was too small.

                                  HARRIS
                    I m so sorry.

                                  DAN
                    Yes, that s what you say to someone 
                    whose life is officially over.    

                                  HARRIS
                    Want to talk about it, Partner?  

                                  DAN
                    No, I want to throw myself into my 
                    work.
                          (putting on white coat)
                    Who do I have this morning?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Harmony Pratt s waiting for you.

                                  DAN
                    Ugh.


      Dan ENTERS.  An obnoxious ten-year-old GIRL is in a chair.

                                  DAN
                          (fake smile)
                    Harmony!  Good to see you.                                                                                 20.


                                    HARMONY
                    Dr. Yoder, you said my braces would 
                    be off before my tenth birthday.  
                    Well, that was four weeks ago, and--

                                  DAN
                    Okay, let s have a look...

      He plunges his fingers into her mouth, MUFFLING her.  As he 
      INSPECTS, Junior ENTERS the room.  He s beyond NERVOUS.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Dr. Yoder?

                                  DAN
                    Oh, for god s sake.  What is it?

                                  JUNIOR
                    I ve come to make a request, which 
                    I hope you ll consider thoroughly, 
                    because it s not a request I take 
                    lightly, nor is it something that-- 

                                  DAN
                    Any chance you get to the point 
                    while I m still in my forties? 

                                  JUNIOR
                    I m deliriously in love with Molly, 
                    and I d like her hand in marriage.

                                  DAN
                    What?!

       Dan REMOVES his fingers from Harmony s mouth.

                                    HARMONY
                    When someone makes a promise, to a 
                    child no less, they should keep it--

      He puts a BITE MOLD in Harmony s mouth, MUFFLING her again.  

                                  DAN
                    Look, Junior.  We ve always let 
                    Molly make her own decisions...

                                  JUNIOR
                    Thank--

                                  DAN
                    But that obviously hasn t worked, 
                    so now it s time for us to step in.  
                    Tell me, why should I actually 
                    allow you to marry my daughter?                                                                                   21.


                                  JUNIOR
                    Um, I can t answer that question.
                          (starts to leave, then)
                    Not now, anyway.  But ask me again 
                    in thirty years.  After I ve spent 
                    three decades by Molly s side, 
                    loving her like nobody else could.  
                    Providing a good life for her and 
                    the baby we re going to have.  And 
                    being a dutiful and respectful son-
                    in-law to you and Mrs. Yoder.  Then 
                    you ll know why you said yes to me.   

                                  DAN
                          (taken aback)
                    Next time, lead with that.  


      At the PIERCING KIOSK, Molly trains under her friend, TINA.  

                                  TINA
                    Nostril piercings are twenty-five, 
                    unless they re also doing ears, in 
                    which case they can get the ears-
                    and-nose special.  

      Junior APPROACHES, on a mission.

                                  JUNIOR
                    May I have a moment with the woman 
                    I love?

                                  MOLLY
                    Oh, hey.  Can we talk in a bit?  
                    I m in the middle of training...

                                  TINA
                    That was pretty much it.  

                                  MOLLY
                    Okay.  

      Junior leads Molly ASIDE, takes her HANDS and KNEELS...

                                  JUNIOR
                    Molly, the moment I stepped off the 
                    bus in your school parking lot for 
                    Model UN and saw you on your knees, 
                    looking for the iPhone that had 
                    fallen off your car, I knew we 
                    belonged together.  So, to save me 
                    from the grim spectre of a moment 
                    without you, will you marry me?                                                                                   22.


                                  MOLLY
                          (thrilled)
                      Seriously?!

      She gives him a big KISS.  Then...

                                  JUNIOR
                    I already received your dad s 
                      permission.

                                  MOLLY
                    You did what?

                                  JUNIOR
                    I asked your dad.  Is that bad?

                                  MOLLY
                    You think it s okay for men to 
                    decide a woman s fate, like she s a 
                    sack of grain, or some chickens?

                                  JUNIOR
                    I just thought it was respectful--

                                  MOLLY
                    It s not respectful of me!  

      She STORMS OFF, leaving Junior confused.    


      Chuey is BEHIND the counter.  Molly BURSTS IN...

                                  MOLLY
                    Mr. Hernandez, I d like to ask you 
                    for your son s hand in marriage.  

      Chuey STARES at Molly for an uncomfortably long BEAT.   

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

                                  MOLLY
                    He said no!

      On their CONFUSION...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Molly still UPSET; Dan and Katrina still CONFUSED.

                                    KATRINA
                    Who said no?

                                  DAN
                    To what?

                                  MOLLY
                    Junior s dad.  I asked him for 
                    Junior s hand, but he said no.  

                                    KATRINA
                    You asked him?

                                  MOLLY
                    Dad gave Junior my hand, so I was 
                    fighting back against our stupid, 
                      patronizing society.  

                                  DAN
                    Do you mean  patriarchal ?

                                  MOLLY
                    Probably!


      MUSIC: THE FAMILIAR, ANNOYING  ANGRY BIRDS  THEME, ON A LOOP.

      Lisette sits with JUNIOR.  Nearby, Demetrio plays ANGRY BIRDS 
      on his laptop.  Chuey ENTERS, contrite, and goes to Junior.  

                                  CHUEY
                    My man, I am so sorry... 

                                  JUNIOR
                    Why?  You re not the one who was 
                    stupid enough to ask her dad for 
                    her hand.  

                                  CHUEY
                    Wait.  You asked her dad?  

                                  JUNIOR
                    Yes, which made her freak out.  I 
                    haven t heard from her since.                                                                                  24.

                    You didn t know that, Chuey?

                                  CHUEY
                    I knew nothing.

                            (suspicious)
                    Then why d you say you were sorry?  

                                  CHUEY
                    I mean, I knew somethin  was wrong.  
                    Look at his body language, all 
                    slumped over.  Like a melted 
                    question mark. 


      Dan, Katrina and Molly, as BEFORE...

                                    KATRINA
                    Why would he say no?

                                  DAN
                    He s a jerk.  At least I said yes.  

                                  MOLLY
                    Yeah, thanks for giving me away, 
                    like some kind of plow horse.

                                  DAN
                    That s okay.  You make it easy to 
                    want to give you away.


      Chuey, Lisette and Junior...

                                  CHUEY
                    You know what?  I say you dodged a 
                    bullet.  Marriage?  That s forever.
                          (off Lisette s look)
                      Theoretically.  


      Dan, Katrina and Molly...

                                  DAN
                      I actually think this is for the 
                    best.  You guys were rushing into 
                    the whole marriage thing...                                                                                  25.



                                  CHUEY
                    Check it out.  Maybe you still go 
                    to Stanford; you come home and help 
                    with the baby on weekends...


                                  DAN

                    going to commute to Stanford and 
                    come home on weekends!

                    I m not going to ASU!  I want to be

                    Sweetie, would you like us to have 
                    a talk with Junior s dad?

                    She s not going to want us to get--

                    Yes, please.                                                                                   26.

                    Let me finish: involved.

      OPENS it, revealing the Yoders.  Molly and Junior rush 
      together and HUG...  

                                  JUNIOR
                    I m so sorry.

                                  MOLLY
                    You didn t do anything wrong...

      She glares at CHUEY, who starts toward the DOOR.  

                                  CHUEY
                    I gotta go.  Bagel emergency...

                                    KATRINA
                    I think you owe Molly an apology.

      A BEAT; Junior and Lisette wondering what s going on.

                    Sorry.  Accident.

      Demetrio EXITS to his room.  Lisette turns to Chuey.

                    Why does she think you owe Molly an

                    Molly -- a pioneer in feminism -- 
                      apparently asked him for Junior s 
                    hand.  But guess who said no.

                    Smother  em?  Dude, you didn t even 
                    know Molly had a boyfriend!  The

                    You re right about me and Molly.  
                    Thing is, my dad was all over me: 
                    Grades, sports, curfews.  Drove me 
                    nuts.  So I tried to be more hands 
                    off with my own kid.  Cut to us at

                    The one of mine I actually met was 
                      thirty-eight when I was born.

                    Once again, we bring different 
                    things to the table.

                    But I know what you mean.   For 
                    while directly we say that life is 
                    ages long, we are reminded that it

                    But I wish there was a way to stop 
                    the rose leaf in mid-air.  Even 
                    just for a day.

                    You know what?  There might be.
