        in a swirl of cloud cover.

            Captain's log, stardate 41249.3. 
            We have orbited the two major 
            planets of the Beta Renner system 
            taking aboard delegates from 
            those two worlds. Since achieving 
            space flight, their major life 
            forms, the Anticans and the 
            Selay... 


        The ship moves majestically out of orbit, goes into the 
        WARP SPEED EFFECT. 

 
        as the Enterprise changes course slightly to intercept 
        the "cloud." 


        The "cloud" bulging out slightly, putting the bulge in 
        the Enterprise's path.

            Negative, Captain. Energy only. 

 
        The Enterprise begins passing just through the wispy 
        edge of it. 


        plunging through space at warp speed, leaving the 
        "cloud" behind. 


        sweeping along at warp speed - nothing to indicate 
        there's trouble aboard this magnificent machine. 


        blasting along at warp speed. 


        EFFECT SHOT of going from WARP SPEED to SUB-WARP. 


        moving through space on IMPULSE POWER.

            continue to run on impulse power. 


        The ship leaps into warp, the stars blurring as she 
        makes the jump.

        traveling on impulse power, unguided by any human hand. 
 

        going into a graceful turn which will take her in the 
        opposite direction. As it finishes the turn, the ship 
        jumps into warp speed. 


        now heading the opposite direction, going back the way 
        she came at warp speed. 


        traveling through space at warp speed. Direction should 
        be the same as PREVIOUS SHOT.

            senior command officers refused 
            to relieve the captain from duty 
            on such slender evidence.

        The Enterprise slows to impulse power as it heads for 
        the large energy pattern "Cloud" which can be seen in 
        far b.g.

            On the orders of... Captain 
            Picard, we have returned to the 
            vicinity of the energy pattern 
            "cloud." I am personally 
            convinced that something from this 
            "cloud" now shares... 


        The Enterprise hovers even closer to the "cloud," 
        waiting. 


        The Enterprise moving close, then closer.
