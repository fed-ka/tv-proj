Sunlit illuminates the darkened stable, highlighting the
contours of a magnificent HORSE (PILGRIM) in surreal, dream-
like imagery: his legs, his muscles, his sheen, his mane...
his eyes. He shakes his head and stamps his feet. He seems
confined. Eager to run.
Pilgrim bursts through the stall and runs out the stables
into a blinding white morning.
Grace awakens, calmly. Takes a breath. Slides out of bed and
stands before a window, overlooking a beautiful Connecticut
country house. We see a snow-covered field and distant woods.
Grace presses her faces against the cold, frosted window
eager to get out.
Alarm rings, ANNIE MACLEAN awakens. She shuts the alarm and
scoots up in bed. She waits. Seconds later the television
across the foot of her bed turns on from a timer -- to a CNN
24 NEWS channel.
Grace, fully dressed except for her boots, tiptoes past a
partially opened bedroom door. Her father ROBERT is asleep,
alone, on his huge king size bed.
Grace is putting on her boots on a bench beside a back door.
She is wearing her mother's outfit. As she slides the boot
on, we see behind her a row of framed photos -- Robert, Grace
and Annie in happy times.
She slaps a note on the refrigerator, with a magnet -- "Gone
riding. Back around 10. Love, G."
Dressed in running clothes, Annie opens the door and picks up
several newspapers that were delivered. She carries them into
the kitchen and sets them beside a huge stack of publications,
magazines, papers, etc... Knowing she must read all of them at
some point, she breathes a disgusted sign. She thumbs through
the POST as she pours herself a cup of coffee. Something
catches her eyes and she snarls:
ANNIE
That little shit!
She dials a portable phone and moves through the apartment as
she talks:
ANNIE
Hi Lucy?... Did I wake you?... Have
you read the Post?... They've got a
little item about me and Fiske. He's
saying I fired him and that I faked
the new circulation figures.. Ha, ha...
Oh, please... It's the last act of a
desperate gnome... Set up a phone call
with Don Farlow for 9:30...
Throughout the phone call, Annie is selecting clothes,
turning on the shower, undressing...
There are several horses in their stalls. Grace and Judith
enter, talking, carrying their English saddles. Judith stops
at a stall, disappearing into it as she says "Hello?"...,
Grace continues to the end stall.
Pilgrim (the horse from the dream) stands looking at her.
GRACE
Hello, beautiful boy.
He's a massive figure beside her but she shows no inhibition.
She enters, touching his muzzle. He plays with her by nudging
her back.
GRACE
Stop... Will you stop!
Annie, casually dressed, enters the empty offices of her
magazine. She turns on the light, revealing a large row of
stalls and glassed in private offices. Everywhere we look, we
see indications of the kind of magazine she edits.
She strolls to her office -- the largest -- surrounded by
windows. The office walls are covered with photos, most of
which are COVER STORIES ON ANNIE.
(One photo is of Annie's father MARTIN. A BRITISH AMBASSADOR
with his young daughter on his lap, her arms affectionately
around his neck. Her mother stands right behind them, posing
like a member of the royal family.)
Annie sits and takes a breath. The only photo on her desk is
a family portrait, taken when Annie was given the Crystal
Award -- Robert, Grace, herself and the Award. She checks her
watch -- it is almost 9:30.
A WALK-IN CLOSET of the master bedroom; one side is Annie's,
one side is Robert's.
Robert stands before his bureau in the closet -- he has just
showered and is putting on his watch and ring which lay
beside his cologne assortment. A FRAMED PHOTO OF HE AND ANNIE
in India -- younger, vibrant, in love... when they first met.
THE PHONE RINGS. Robert enters into the bedroom to pick up.
ROBERT
Hello?
INSERT ANNIE: They speak in dulled, emotionless voices:
ANNIE
It's me.
ROBERT
Hi.
ANNIE
Hi.
Awkward pause.
ROBERT
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
ANNIE
I should be in by two.
ROBERT
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
ANNIE
Sure... What's Grace up to?
ROBERT
Riding with Judith.
Beat.
ANNIE
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't
have brought it up over the phone.
ROBERT
That's okay. We have to talk about it
and we're not always in the same place
... so... I just have to get used to it.
(beat)
What do you want to do about dinner?
ANNIE
I don't know. We'll figure it out.
Pause. There is a lot unspoken but understood between them.
Annie's other phone line rings. Robert hears it as well.
ROBERT
Okay. We'll see you later then.
ANNIE
Yeah. Bye.
Annie picks up the other line and her manner brightens, her
energy boosts...
ANNIE
DON! My love, how are you? Did you hear
about Fiske?... No, suing is too
civilized. Can't we get your friend at Le
Cirque to serve him a fatal piece of
poached salmon?... Ha, ha... That's even
better...
Annie's office is now crowded with a dozen or so employees;
sitting on the couch, on the window sills, on the arms of
chairs, against the walls... Paper bag emptied of bagels,
cream cheese, orange juice, paper plates...
Hand Held Camera captures the energy of the room as it
follows overlapping lines, laughter, etc... yet, no matter how
casual it all seems, Annie is very much at the center of
control... We enter the scene of LAUGHTER, as Annie asks
KEVIN, a feature writer:
ANNIE
... So what did you say to her?
KEVIN
I said, thank you very much...
(LAUGHTER, AD LIBS)
I really should do the interview... But
perhaps if you'd like to have dinner...
LAUGHTER... Everyone starts Ad Libbing...
VARIOUS CHARACTERS
Dinner!!... He's so cute.... Why don't I
get those kind of interviews?... Look,
he has husband number eight written on
his forehead...
ANNIE
All right, all right, all right... Kevin,
good job. Write the interview. If I don't
like it, you may have to sleep with her
for a follow-up!
(laughter)
Now... I'm thinking about another fashion
designer spread... Who's news out there?
Characters shout out designer names and comments as the phone
rings and LUCY picks up... speaking amdist the talking...
LUCY
Hold on.
(presses hold)
Gottschalk.
The room goes dead quiet, instantly. Then erupts in laughter
as everyone realizes it. Annie, however, waves her hand as
she takes the phone...
ANNIE
Quiet... Quiet!
Everyone obeys. Annie presses SPEAKER PHONE.
ANNIE
David?
DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
Who's there?
ANNIE
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
Did you speak to Farlow?
ANNIE
Yes. We're suing.
DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just
make it a bigger story.
ANNIE
David, he signed an agreement that he
wouldn't talk to the press and he's
libeled me by saying I faked the figures.
You're not going soft on me, are you?
Silence. Gottschalk doesn't immediately respond. Everyone
waits. Covert looks between characters suggest this is
interesting -- has Annie over-stepped her bounds with the
magazine's owner? Annie waits without a shred of anxiety --
even though she might have some. Finally:
DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
Well, I suppose we could use another
good public feud...
ANNIE
Exactly...
Everyone silently acknowledges Annie guts and influence.
ANGLE ON GRACE'S NOTE on the refrigerator as Robert enters
from the outside with two bags of groceries. He places them on
the counter near the PHONE MACHINE. He sees ONE MESSAGE is
there. He presses PLAY as he puts away the groceries.
A BEAT LATER the PHONE RINGS and he picks up, with the machine
still playing...
ROBERT
(on phone)
Hello? Paul, hi -- are you guys back?
How was it? Oh that sounds great. Oh
Paul.. hold on...
LIZ
(on machine)
Robert! Are you there?... Robert! It's
Liz!... Look, there's... there's been
an accident... Uh... Jesus... uh...
As Robert listens, the voice of Liz's on the machine from
inside, pulls his attention. On hearing "accident," Robert
lowers the receiver, frozen, as he listens to Liz...
LIZ
(on machine)
Robert, just call me on my call phone...
1-917-449-7805...
Annie sits on a train -- her laptop out, notes beside her,
her cellular phone, ever-ready. The train passes through
beautiful countryside but Annie is focused on an editorial
she's writing.
The train pulls into a station and stops, causing Annie to
take a break and stretch her arms and neck. She looks out the
window for the first time and sees:
A MAN, his hands in his pockets, waiting on the platform. She
watches as the Man holds out his arms to his two young
children, who are getting off the train. He picks them up as
his wife enters the scene, kissing him and wrapping her arm
around his waist. The children talk a mile a minute and the
father listens to every word.
Annie doesn't even realize she is staring. As they leave the
platform, she turns back to her laptop. As the train begins
to move again, Annie returns to work.
HER CELLULAR PHONE RINGS. She answers.
ANNIE
Yeah?... Hi. I made the 1:00 so...
The expression on her face sinks into a stunned panic.
Annie is running through the corridors, her bags in tow. She
sees Robert standing in the corridor talking to a DOCTOR. She
runs for them.
When she appears, Robert and the Doctor stop their
conversation. Robert looks to Annie, who is waiting for news.
ANNIE
WHAT!?
Robert is teary eyed, beaten down.
ROBERT
Judith's dead.
Annie's horrified, waiting for news of Grace.
ANNIE
What about Grace?
ROBERT
She was in pretty bad shape. They've
done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some
hemorrhaging...
DOCTOR
But nothing we can't handle...
ANNIE
(impatient)
Where is she now?
DOCTOR
Surgery.
ANNIE
Surgery! For what-?
ROBERT
(interrupting)
Annie, her leg was shattered -- what
they call the distal epi.. epi..
DOCTOR
Distal epicondyle of the femur...
ROBERT
(quietly, crying)
They have to take the leg off.
Annie responds without tears and cries but with a quiet
shock. We can tell her mind is racing, trying to process the
information, until finally she asks:
ANNIE
Which leg?
The Doctor and Robert are surprised by the question.
ROBERT
What difference does it make?
Annie stares for a beat, then nods apologetically.
Camera moves from Grace's face down her body to Robert's
hand, which rubs her good leg. He looks at her lovingly,
pushing the hair from her forehead.
Annie, needing to do something, tenderly straightens Grace's
blankets. It is plain to see where her leg had once been.
Robert can't look. Annie, one to face her fears, bravely
looks at it head on. She notices the I.V. Bag and rises on:
ANNIE
That bag's almost empty.
ROBERT
(looking)
No, it's got a little left. They'll be
in to change it.
ANNIE
(as she exits)
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
Robert is about to respond but Annie is already out the door.
We hear the O.S. DIALOGUE as Robert listens.
ANNIE (O.S.)
Excuse me, my daughter needs a new
I.V.
NURSE (O.S.)
We have her down, we'll be right in.
ANNIE (O.S.)
I'd like it taken care of now please.
Annie enters first.
ANNIE
You have to keep on top of these people
or else they just sit on their --
But Robert is ignoring her. Facing Grace, smoothing away her
hair. He's giving her the silent treatment. Annie knows this
means Robert doesn't approve of her dictatorial behavior.
Annoyed, she turns away as well.
The Nurse enters with a new bag and begins to replace the old
one as Robert backs away.
ROBERT
I'm sorry.
ANNIE
Tch. What are you --
Annie, about to respond to his inappropriate politeness, is
stopped by Robert, who finally looks at her. It's a powerful
look that tells her to calm down and shut up. It's a look
that, for all of Robert's sensitivity, affects Annie. She
gets the message and stays calm.
As the nurse leaves, Annie is about to say thank you, but
Robert beats her to it.
ROBERT
Thank you.
Annie and Robert stand facing each other, when the PHONE RINGS.
Annie picks up.
INTERCUT
A line of recovery stalls with various sick and hurt animals.
Liz, exhausted asleep, on a chair outside a stall. There's a
slight scratching sound. A hoof against the stall. It gets
louder, awakening Liz. She gets up and looks inside the
paddled stall:
Pilgrim is lying in the stall, heavily bandaged. He is waking
up. His first instinct is to kick at the paddled stall walls.
He looks at Liz, his eyes filled with madness -- enraged to
still be alive.
Annie opens the door and enters, flicking on the light.
Camera is on her back, as she places a small suitcase on the
bed and opens it. She begins her task with cool efficiency.
Opening drawers and closets, assessing what should be taken,
what isn't necessary.
Suddenly, she stops. She feels disoriented for a moment. She
can't remember the last time she was inside this room. She
takes a moment to pause and actually look around.
In the light, we now see more of Grace's inner sanctum. Horse
riding prize ribbons in various colors adorn the walls.
Books. A girl's bureau cluttered with teenage possession
ranging from childhood toys to items that suggest a reaching
towards adulthood. Annie examines some items, affectionately.
A GOOD LUCK CHARM from India sits among her things. Annie
takes it to pack in the suitcase.
She notices a framed 8X10 of Grace sitting proudly atop
Pilgrim with Judith at her heel. She then notices the edge of
another picture behind this one, in the frame. She pulls the
Pilgrim photo out to reveal: An old 8X10 of Annie hugging
Grace as a toddler. With her back to Camera, Annie remembers:
MEMORY:
Annie is playing with toddler Grace. Chasing her around the
room. Picking her and tossing her onto a small, toddler bed.
Blowing into her stomach. Grace is laughing uncontrollably.
END OF MEMORY
Annie slides the Pilgrim picture back into the frame, then
returns to her task of packing.
Annie enters. No one else is there. She places the suitcase
on a chair and opens it. She takes out the INDIAN LUCKY CHARM
and some horse books, and places them on her bedside table.
She takes care to prop up the Lucky Charm.
She wets a cloth with some water from a pitcher and gently
wipes Grace's sweaty brow... INSERT VISUAL FLASHBACK HERE,
instead of in Country House.
Annie then continues unpacking the suitcase. She opens
Grace's closet and sees a hospital bag filled with Grace's
clothes at the time of the accident. Annie examines them and
discovers they are hers. Annie shoves the clothes into a bag
and starts unpacking.
The Clock is ticking on the wall. The cafeteria is empty
except for one tired Intern, drinking coffee on a break.
Robert and Annie are having a cup of coffee. In the silence,
they search for things to say. Until:
ROBERT
I saw Judith's parents while you were
at the apartment...
(Annie listens)
I wanted to say something...
(beat)
But I... I was so relieved that Grace
was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
ANNIE
We're very lucky.
ROBERT
(nods)
The funeral's on Friday.
He rises and crosses to the self-help coffee dispenser as he
continues...
ROBERT
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex
brought that fabric over...
ANNIE
Okay.
ROBERT
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't
know what to tell him...
(returns to table, sits)
... Whether or not we were...
(beat)
... if we still we're thinking of redoing
the couch.
Annie just nods. She senses Robert is looking for some kind
of reassurance, but she can't give it to him. He continues;
ROBERT
... And uh... Mario called about moving
the wisteria?
ANNIE
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
Pause. Annie looks at her husband as he stares off to the
side, deep in his thoughts. She can sense he's sinking as he
fidgets with the napkins. She remembers:
MEMORY:
A younger Annie stands in a bathrobe, noticeably pregnant,
cooking at a stove -- reading instructions from a propped up
cookbook. FRANK SINATRA IS BLASTING as she sings along, in
full voice, without inhibitions;
ANNIE
"SHE'S LOVES THE THEATRE BUT NEVER COMES
LATE... SHE NEVER BOTHERS WITH PEOPLE SHE
HATES... THAT'S WHY THE LADY IS A TRAMP!..."
A younger Robert, wearing a suit, arrives home from work. Seeing
her, he smiles affectionately. He puts down his briefcase and
bursts into his own playful Sinatra impersonation:
ROBERT
"She loves the free..."
Startled, Annie turns around and smiles:
ROBERT
(sexily undoing his tie)
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE
WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT
IT'S 'OK'...
ANNIE
(a la fan)
Sing it to me, Frankie!
ROBERT
(a la Sinatra cool)
How's my pregnant chick!
She moves to him and they embrace... He wraps his arms around
her. They kiss. Annie laughs.
ANNIE
You can hardly get your arms around me.
How depressing. You're so early.
ROBERT
I had to excuse myself from a meeting.
It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about
the baby... you... and, I swear, I was
going to start bawling right into my
briefs.
ANNIE
(loving it)
Aw... that's so sweet.
ROBERT
I love you.
ANNIE
Do you? Do you really?
They turn to each other and kiss.
END OF MEMORY.
Annie and Robert sit silently at the table in an empty hospital
cafeteria, a lifetime later.
The room's lights are dimmed. Dawn is being to break through.
Grace, slowly, opens her eyes coming out of sedation. She
takes a moment to figure out where she is... to remember.
She uses her hands to hoist herself up, but she's unsteady
and knocks into her bedside table -- knocking the Good Luck
Charm from India off the table. It rolls under the bed, with
a water tumbler. Grace never sees the Charm.
Grace looks where her leg once was. She feels the blanket,
the empty space where her leg once was... just like her mother
did (did her father couldn't). Instead of self-pity, she's
oddly fascinated.
DISSOLVE TO:
Daylight pours in. Robert and Annie enter. Robert, loaded
with gifts, immediately crosses to Grace, on the side of her
good leg. Annie takes her position beside the lost leg.
Robert kisses his daughter;
ROBERT
Hi, sweetheart...
Annie's hand finds Grace's hand, and holds one of her fingers
tightly. Grace responds by wrapping her hand around her
mother's. They exchange a look of respect and gratitude.
GRACE
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
ROBERT
No, not yet.
GRACE
How's Pilgrim doing?
ANNIE
Liz is taking care of him.
(to change the subject)
The doctor said the sooner you start
therapy the better the chances are you
can --
GRACE
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're
already putting me in therapy!!
Annie, slightly hurt, drops it as Robert takes over:
ROBERT
The doctor said whenever you're ready.
Take your time. You tell us... But he
thinks it'll only be a few months, then --
As Robert continues talking, Annie drifts to the Nurse.
Needing to manage something, she asks:
ANNIE
Did you get her fresh towels?
SOME TIME LATER:
The three sit at a dinner table, eating dinner. Grace picks
at her food. Robert can't help staring at her. Annie eats,
watching them both.
ROBERT
Do you want something else, honey?
We order something else?
GRACE
No, I'm just not that hungry.
ANNIE
Why don't you go lie down?
GRACE
I don't want to lie down. I've been
lying down enough.
ROBERT
You want to watch some television?
GRACE
(edgy)
Maybe... look -- just...
Robert and Annie wait. She doesn't continue. She rises,
reaching for her crutches. Robert moves to help.
GRACE
I got it! I got it!
She exits into her room. Annie looks at him disapprovingly.
Annie and Robert stand before their separate sinks, talking
to each other through their separate mirrors, as they wash up
for bed.
ANNIE
You've got to stop doing that?
ROBERT
Doing what?
ANNIE
Helping all the time! Running to her
every time she trips or falls...
Anticipating her all the time.
Robert shuts off his sink and dries his face, without a word.
He exits into the bedroom, and gets into bed. For a beat, he
stares up at the ceiling -- then says quite plainly.
ROBERT
You know, Annie, this didn't just happen
to you.
Annie is applying moisturizer when she hears this. As it
sinks in, she doesn't like it.
Grace stands by her door and can hear her parents muffled,
tense voices. Annie is angry at his complacency. Robert just
wants what's best for Grace. She closes the door. Silence.
She puts her crutches against the wall and tries to walk
towards her bureau without them. It is a struggle, but she
does... almost falling, but grabbing the bureau just in time.
The 8X10 of her and Pilgrim, falls face down. She props it up
and looks at it -- focusing on her horse, then on Judith.
Suddenly, she lashes out, knocking the photograph onto the
floor...
ROBERT (O.S.)
Honey, you all right? Did something
fall?
GRACE
(angrily shouts)
NO!
Grace makes her way through the hall. It is the first time
she has had to maneuver through a crowd. Some of the younger
children are especially unconscious. Grace sweats her way
through, trying to maintain her balance and her sanity.
As Grace slowly moves along, whatever small faith she had
that she could get through this day, begins to diminish.
Annie moves about the office, hands in pocket, in front of
her wall of windows. LUCY and her staff sitting around the
office. Annie is speaking to a YOUNG WOMAN staff member;
ANNIE
I don't care what he told you! The
man's a liar! The man's an actor, for
Christ's sake. They're all liars!
They'll say anything to get a cover...
The Young Woman looks insulted. AN ASSISTANT comes in to give
Annie a note;
Annie is at her desk studying Grace's book on Horse Whisperers.
Robert is on his bed with briefs laid out before him.
The door is closed. A SONG blares on her stereo. Grace is in
her bed watching a video of her and Pilgrim... riding at a
horse show. There's a shot of Annie standing proudly,
watching her ride. Another shot of her and Judith, both of
them on their horses, waving to camera.
Grace enters.
GRACE
Dad?
Both Robert and Annie look up.
ROBERT
What, sweetheart?
GRACE
(beat)
I want to see Pilgrim.
Robert and Annie exchange an anxious look.
Annie sits in the huge reading room, books spread out before
her, under a green reading lamp. Her voice tells us what she's
reading:
ANNIE (V.O.)
"It was in America that horses first
roamed..."
In the books, we see pictures, lithographs, paintings and
drawings...
ANNIE (V.O.)
"A million years before the birth of
man, they grazed the vast empty plains of
grass and crossed to other continents
over bridges of rocks... They first knew
man as the hunted knows the hunter, for
long before man saw horses as a means to
killing other beasts, man killed them for
meat..."
ANNIE'S V.O. CONTINUES OVER;
ANNIE (V.O.)
"...The alliance with man would forever
be fragile -- for the fear he'd struck
into their hearts was too deep to be
dislodged... Since that Neolithic moment
when a horse was first haltered, there
were those among men who understood
this..."
Grace sits alone in her darkened room, staring out the window
but not looking at anything. There's a discomforting distance
in her expression.
ANNIE (V.O.)
"... They could see into the creature's
soul and soothe the wounds they found
there..."
DISSOLVE TO:
A small, well-used trailer. Tom and Rona are finishing dinner
like comfortable old friends. Rona rises, taking the plates
into the kitchen and starts rinsing them:
RONA
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from
some woman in New York. She sounded
pretty wound up.
TOM
I don't any woman in New York. But from
what I hear, most of them are wound up.
RONA
The number's by the phone.
He nods but doesn't move. He just looks at Rona and smiles.
She's a good woman. But Tom hopes she doesn't want anymore
than what they have together. Rona notices him looking and
smiles:
RONA
What are you looking at, young man?
TOM
How long were you married?
RONA
Long enough.
TOM
You ever miss it?
RONA
Does a horse miss a saddle?
TOM
Sometimes.
She chuckles, shuts the water off and crosses back to him,
sitting beside him.
RONA
Well as a matter of fact, I don't... most
of the time.
She starts unbuttoning his shirt.
TOM
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good
together even when we were good together.
RONA
Honey... I was always good.
Tom smiles as Rona leans in. They kiss.
Annie is looking over a magazine cover with Lucy and her staffers.
She is unhappy.
ANNIE
You know it's perfectly shot, it's
perfectly cropped, it's perfectly laid
out and I'm so bloody bored, I'd rather
buy a Motor Racing magazine -- Start
over.
Some general whines and groans as her assistant hands her a
note.
ANNIE
Uh, would you all excuse me a moment?
She waits for them to leave as she sits before the phone. One
of her lines is lit:
Annie reaches for Grace's bedroom door, then pauses. She
realizes she should knock. She does and whispers:
ANNIE
Grace?
(knocks again)
Grace, it's mom.
Annie slowly opens the door. She finds Grace's bed empty. She
looks over to the window to find Grace sitting in a chair, in
the dark, looking out the window.
ANNIE
Grace. What are you doing?
Not looking up, Grace speaks in a hollow voice.
GRACE
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me
from India.
ANNIE
I brought it to you in the hospital.
GRACE
No, you didn't.
ANNIE
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
GRACE
(apathetic)
Doesn't matter.
Beat.
ANNIE
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
GRACE
What about him?
ANNIE
Well... how you feel all right about
telling Liz to put him down...
GRACE
I think we should. It's not fair to let
him suffer. He's not much use anymore.
He'd hate living like that.
ANNIE
I think that's... very compassionate
and... mature way of looking at it.
GRACE
Mom?
ANNIE
Yeah?
GRACE
Maybe they should put me down too.
ANNIE
What?
GRACE
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why
can't they be compassionate to me?
What frightens Annie most is the calm and apathy in Grace's
voice. She's surrendering... Annie, for the first time in a
long time, feels she's losing control.
Annie sits alone at the kitchen table, nursing a glass of
wine.
Robert enters and sits opposite her, wearing a tuxedo -- his
tie and collar undone.
ANNIE
How was the dinner?
ROBERT
(wry)
All our "favorite" people were there
saying all their "favorite" things about
their "favorite" subjects. I thought to
myself, we've been friends with these
people almost twenty years and nobody
knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't
like each other and have nobody go to
dinners with.
ANNIE
Why did you go?
ROBERT
(surprised)
They're still our friends, Annie. It's
nothing serious. You kid about them all
the time... And I could tell Paul really
appreciated me being there.
He drinks Annie's wine as she looks at him.
ROBERT
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
ANNIE
Yeah.
ROBERT
What did he say?
ANNIE
No.
Robert nods. Accepting. Silence. Annie sips her wine. Then:
ROBERT
I was thinking... Maybe we should think
about the three of us going someplace
warm... Remember that house we rented in
Bermuda... The pink one with the --
His arm accidentally spills the wine.
ROBERT
Shit.
As he bends down to wipe it up with a napkin, Annie watches
Robert clean the spill. Something about his movements, his
posture -- a sense of weakness, of surrendering, of not having
the inclination to fight, of just accepting and smoothing
over the rough sports -- strikes her hard. Annie realizes the
love she feels for Robert isn't fading. It's gone.
He finishes cleaning and sits.
ROBERT
What was I saying?
ANNIE
About us going someplace warm...
Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts
or bathing suits or summer dresses...
Robert looks at her and realizes it's a bad idea. He nods,
again, getting the message. Silence. In that silence, Annie
looks at him... and makes a decision:
ANNIE
Robert, I want to take Pilgrim out to Mr.
Booker. Drive him out to Montana... With
Grace.
Robert is confused... and a little worried.
ROBERT
I don't understand. You just said he
said no.
ANNIE
He did, but... I think I can change his
mind.
ROBERT
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.
Absolutely not.
ANNIE
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school.
And she can't sit in this apartment all
day... I think it would be good for her.
ROBERT
(at a loss)
NO! What are you -- you're serious about
this?
ANNIE
I've called Liz. They can set me up with
a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd
stay at motels along the way...
ROBERT
(overlapping)
You've already made arrangements!?
ANNIE
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
ROBERT
I come home and you tell me we're going
to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I
can't just pick up and leave...
ANNIE
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
ROBERT
You want to do this by yourself? How?
You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
ANNIE
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert.
I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
ROBERT
(overlapping)
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
ANNIE
I'm in charge. I went back very soon
after the accident. They didn't expect me
for a couple of months. I'll just take
that time now... I can still oversee
things from Montana... Take my fax...
My computer...
Beat. Robert fears this is about the marriage. Yet --
ROBERT
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think
it's a good idea
ANNIE
Why?!
ROBERT
(searching)
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs
security now... stability...
ANNIE
I can't say he's been all that effective
with her.
ROBERT
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes
time.
ANNIE
I don't care what he says! We have to do
something, Robert! I can't sit here and
trust everything's going to work out just
by pretending it will.
ROBERT
I'm not pretending anything!
Beat. Robert just stares at her. He looks concerned... almost
worried. Annie gets uncomfortable.
ANNIE
What?
It is very difficult for Robert to say;
ROBERT
I thought... well, ever since the
accident, I just thought we...
He stops. Annie knows where he headed and prays to God he
doesn't continue. He doesn't. A thick silence hangs between
them.
ROBERT
I really wish I could understand why
you think this is so necessary.
ANNIE
(frustrated)
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing
her.
(he listens)
I don't care what the doctors say. The
truth is, they don't know anymore than
we do -- less, when it comes to Grace...
This may not sound sensible or... logical,
but nobody's suggesting anything better.
I can't explain it, Robert. I just have
this feeling... this annoying... bloody
feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim
can be made all right... then so can Grace.
I just know it!
Robert can feel the strength of her will. He can find no way
around it.
ROBERT
What if she doesn't want to go?
ANNIE
She will if you think she should.
ROBERT
And you think it's best if I don't come.
ANNIE
(hesitates)
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a
dictator. If you feel you should come,
then come. Just do whatever you think
is right.
At some moment, they realize Grace is standing at the entrance
to the kitchen. They are surprised.
GRACE
I'm not going! I don't care what she
says!
Annie lowers her head. Robert stares at Grace as she walks to
him.
GRACE
Daddy?... I don't want to go.
Grace stands next to Robert. He holds her hands. Annie looks
at him, without sympathy. Robert looks back. In his face is
the total acceptance of what must be. As well as the sadness
of it's inevitability. He looks back at his daughter, whose
eyes have never left him.
Grace, in the back seat, wearing her headphones, listening to
her music (maybe LIZ PHAIR OR HOLLY COLE). Detached. Non-
committal. As trucks pass by, their time slapping the pavement,
she reacts and turns to the other window.
Annie, in sunglasses, shifts her attention between the road
and her rear-view mirror -- checking on Grace.
A small furnished motel room with two twin beds.
Grace sits up in bed watching TV, with no expression. A sitcom
with canned laughter serves as a hypnotic drug.
Annie enters from the bathroom, after showering, drying her
hair. Grace doesn't bother to look up.
ANNIE
You want to take your bath?
(Grace shakes her head)
We have to get up early tomorrow. You
may not have enough time to --
GRACE
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
She begins moving off the bed.
ANNIE
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just
that we may not have enough --
GRACE
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
ANNIE
Look, if you want to take it in the
morning, that's fine.
GRACE
(interrupts on "fine")
I don't care.
Annie realizes she may have pushed too hard, but she also
realizes there's no talking to Grace now. So, she achieves
her goal --
JANNIE
Take it now.
Grace hobbles off the bed, enters the bathroom and shuts the
door.
The lights are off. Annie lays in bed, wide awake. It is the
middle of the night.
Grace, asleep in the other bed, begins whimpering. She's
having a bad dream. Annie rises -- considering whether or not
to intercede... Finally, Grace begins to cry out... softly at
first, but with increasing intensity until she awakens in
fear... Annie appears right by her side.
ANNIE
What, sweetheart? What?
Shaken, Grace cannot fight how much she needs her mother at
that moment. She wraps her arms around her, tightly, and tries
to catch her breath.
ANNIE
It's sleeping in a strange bed,
that's all. Happens sometimes. It's
Ok. It's OK.
Grace and Annie occupy their same positions. Annie is on the
car phone with her office.
ANNIE
Okay, listen -- let's do this. When
I get to the next motel, I'll see if
they have a fax. If not, I'll call
you tomorrow to --
Annie continues O.S. when we hear a shifting, a rocking in
the trailer behind them. As if Pilgrim made a sudden move.
Grace quickly turns her head. Annie looks in the rear view at
Grace.
ANNIE
Uh Lucy, look, I have to go. OK...
Later.
Annie hangs up and smiles at Grace through the mirror. Grace
reaches for her walkman and headphones. Annie offers;
ANNIE
Grace! GRACE!
Grace lowers one side of her headphones;
ANNIE
Would you like to put your music on
up here?
Grace shrugs. Annie shrugs it off as well. Grace replaces the
headphone. Annie turns on the radio -- nothing but country or
gospel or religious talk shows... She shuts it off. Frustrated,
Annie looks up ahead and sees:
A TRUCK STOP DINER
Annie yells to be heard through the headphones;
ANNIE
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU
HUNGRY!?
GRACE
(shrugs)
Whatever you want.
ANNIE
Fine!
GRACE
Fine.
Annoyed, Annie pulls onto the gravel and stops, talking to
herself --
ANNIE
Fine!
She exits the car, banging the door. As she walks acrund the
car to help Grace, she talks to herself in a sarcastic whisper:
ANNIE
"Whatever you want!" Well, this is what
I want. I want to eat lunch and I want
to smoke a cigarette and I want to keep
talking to myself for the next two
thousand fucking miles..."!
She opens Grace's door. Grace senses her mother's anger.
Annie and Grace enter. They look around:
Formica floors, truckers in caps and beer bellies stuffed
into booths or at the counter. There is not a single space
available.
Annie and Grace stand near the entrance. Another Trucker
enters and they step aside, huddled together in this foreign
land.
Grace and Annie enter the room to find A DOUBLE BED instead
of two twins. Neither comments.
Annie exits O.S., carrying the bags inside, as she says:
DISSOLVE TO:
ANNIE
You should call your dad before it
gets too late.
GRACE
I already did.
(Annie's surprised)
This morning. When you went running.
ANNIE
Oh. You didn't tell me.
GRACE
I didn't know I had to.
ANNIE
(stares angrily, speaks
softly)
You don't.
Silence. Annie exits past her to the car.
DISSOLVE TO:
LATER
Grace is asleep in her twin bed. Once again, Annie is wide
awake. The clock reads: 4:55 AM. But Annie can not sleep.
Camera moves away from Annie, past her side of the bed, to
the other side of the room.
WE SEE THE SHADOW OF A WOMAN coming towards the bed. She
comes in camera angle and we follow to her back to the bed,
which has now transformed into --
A BED FROM THE PAST, IN WHICH A TEN-YEAR-OLD ANNIE IS
SLEEPING WITH HER YOUNGER BROTHER GEORGE.
WE ARE IN MEMORY.
The Woman gently shakes little Annie awaken.
WOMAN
Annie... Annie, sweetheart... wake
up.
The little girl, with sleep in her eyes, turns and sees her.
WOMAN
Bad news I'm afraid. Your Daddy's
gone.
END OF MEMORY.
Annie, in present time next to Grace, thinks of this as she
stays awake. Putting her jogging parka on over her nightgown,
she goes outside.
Grace leans against the window in the back, in one of her
darker moods. Annie switches radio stations, from Bible
thumping to Farm reports. She shuts it off. Silence.
She sees a ROAD SIGH: "LITTLE BIGHORN NATIONAL MONUMENT".
ANNIE
Grace, look!
Grace reads the sign.
ANNIE
Would you like to see that?
GRACE
I don't care.
ANNIE
(overlapping)
I don't care.
Annie's comic mimicking, throws Grace off center.
Annie turns off onto the exit. They drive by a massive casino
-- it's neon sign flickering. They drive up a hill past a cafe,
two Indians in high crowned Cowboy hats standing outside of
the cafe. She drives up a hill towards the parking lot of the
Monument...
ANNIE
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any
of the sights yet. It's history. When
I was thirteen I used to love seeing
things like this.
GRACE
You were never thirteen, Mom.
Annie laughs, taking it as a joke. Grace almost smiles.
But, Annie drives up to sign only to find a CLOSED SIGN. The
park was closed at six. Annie stops the car. She's hit a
brick wall once more. Silence. Finally, Grace speaks with her
usual sarcasm;
GRACE
Great idea. So now what?
Beat. Annie's patience snaps;
ANNIE
How long is this going to go on?
GRACE
What?
ANNIE
You know what I mean?
(turns to the back seat)
Is this it now? Is this the way we're
going to be from now on?
Ignoring her, Grace edges to the passenger side and exits the
car. Annie gets out of the driver's side and walks around as
she speaks:
ANNIE
Do you want us to turn around and go
back home? Do you?
GRACE
What are you asking me for? You didn't
ask me if I wanted to come in the first
place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
She begins to turn away. Annie grabs her arm.
ANNIE
Who do you think I'm doing this for?
I'm doing this for you!
GRACE
Bullshit! It's about you! About you
deciding! About you always being
right! You always getting everything
your way, controlling everybody --
like we work for you or something!
ANNIE
I don't believe this!
GRACE
You just want to get away from Daddy
and you're using me to do it!
ANNIE
That's not true! Whatever problems your
father and I are having, have nothing
to do with this.
GRACE
You're amazing! You act like I don't
live in that house! Don't you think I
hear the two of you!? Don't you think
I can tell what's going on? I'm not
five years old, Mom!
(Annie is stopped)
You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy
doesn't want to.
ANNIE
Did he tell you that?
GRACE
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so
obvious you can't stand him.
ANNIE
That's not true!
GRACE
Then why do you want to leave?
ANNIE
It's... it's not that simple to explain.
I know you think it is, but it's not.
The truth is, I don't really know what
I want to do. I don't have all the
answers.
GRACE
No, you just act like you do.
Annie is choked with fury. She doesn't know whether to
scream, cry or strangle Grace. She turns away and begins
walking quickly, blindly, up past a grove of trees. She comes
to a CEMETERY enclosed by a black railing. At the crest of
the hill there's a stone monument "The Little Bighorn
Cemetery."
In the growing darkness, she sees, scattered on the hillsides
below her, white tombstones. A place of sorrow. A cool breeze
ruffles her coat and she sticks her hands in her pockets.
Frustrated, alone, at a complete loss as to what to do, what
action to take -- Annie, for the first time in frozen,
standing still -- and with her, comes a rush of emotion.
She sits with her back against the monument and begins to
weep. For Grace, for Robert, herself, for the tombstones, for
everyone.
A FLASHLIGHT shines on her face. It is a PARK RANGER.
PARK RANGER
You okay, ma'am?
ANNIE
(wipes face)
Yes. Fine.
PARK RANGER
That young lady is getting a little
worried.
Annie realizes she left Grace alone as it got darker.
ANNIE
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...
Annie rises and is escorted back to the Suburban by the
Ranger. She sees:
Grace is sitting in the front seat now, waiting for her --
like a little girl lost.
Annie gets into the driver's seat. Buckles up. Grace holds
back tears.
ANNIE
You buckled up?
(Grace nods)
You cold?
GRACE
Little.
Annie reaches into the back seat and pulls a blanket out,
handing it to Grace, making sure it covers her. Grace turns
towards the window and closes her eyes. Annie starts the car.
Annie and Grace, both in front seats, eating doughnuts and
coffee. They stop.
POV -- Through the windshield is an endless sky and a rolling
sea of land.
GRACE
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
ANNIE
Don't they believe in signs here?
GRACE
What would they say? "Ten miles to big
rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
ANNIE
There was supposed to be a turn off.
Did I miss it?
GRACE
I didn't see it.
Their Suburban is the only vehicle on what seems like miles
of road. Annie sighs and puts the Suburban in drive.
Annie, showered and changed, is trying to follow Mr.
Peterson's directions to Tom's ranch -- written on Peterson
motel stationary. She is lost once again.
ANNIE
(reading)
... after left, stay on main road until
rise, then...
(frustrated)
What bloody rise?!? What main road!?
She stops the Suburban (no longer carrying the trailer).
Annie, panting, looks ahead and sees nothing but empty space,
above and below -- as if the earth and sky met with nothing in
between.
She sighs and starts the car again. As she moves forward, she
senses an almost indistinguishable rise in the road -- as we
follow her POV up the road through the windshield to reveal:
POV -- A BREATHTAKING VALLEY just beyond the rise, hidden
from view only a few yards before. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE RANCH
sits nestled in the valley, a few miles away. Annie is
impressed.
Frank, Tom, Joe and TOM TWIN BOYS, 6 years old, sit at a dining
table eating dinner, as Diane serves. We parachute into the
middle of the conversation:
DIANE
... well, I just think she's got a lot
of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that
child and that poor animal all the way...
(TO ONE OF THE TWINS)
You eat with those fingers again and you
know what'll happen!
(the boy cowers)
Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
FRANK
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom,
she's a pretty determined woman. Must've
thought it was worth it.
DIANE
(sits down)
I guess they'll want feeding and all, out
here all day long.
TOM
I don't believe they'll expect that.
DIANE
What, they ain't going forty miles into
Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
FRANK
Mixed salad.
DIANE
What?
FRANK
(slyly)
I believe women from New York eat mixed
salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
Tom hides a grin -- he knows Frank into teasing her now.
TOM
I believe so. Saw it on a television
show, once.
DIANE
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle
ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Everyone eats. Beat.
JOE
When you figure on branding?
FRANK
Weekend after next...
TOM
If the weather holds.
Frank nods. Silence again. Everyone eats. Beat.
JOE
What's an editor do anyway?
DIANE
(playing)
We're not sure, sweetheart, but they
eat like rabbits.
Tom and Frank chuckle. Diane smiles -- in on the joke with
them. The children are curiously confused.
Camera moves to reveal Annie on the phone in front of her
computer and fax...
plugging in extension cords as she talks:
ANNIE
... the phone company's putting in extra
lines. I'll call back with the numbers.
Oh, and I want you to get in touch with
this lady in town here -- they say she's
sort of a physical therapist for the
rodeo boys but keep the one at the
hospital we already contacted on call...
Grace sits alone in the living room. Watching TV, but anxious
and disturbed about what she's committed herself to.
Diane is in her bathrobe doing bills at the kitchen table, as
she listens to a BOOK OF TAPE. Her hand on her forehead, her
other hand writing. Tom enters to take his hat off the
sideboard. He moves to the table and reaches over for a
cookie from a plate of cookies. Without looking up, Diane
slaps his hand. Tom then pours himself a cup of coffee... then
swiftly sneaks his hand back and grabs a cookie. Diane smiles.
Tom exits.
It is only then that Diane looks up after him.
Camera follows Tom towards his bedroom --
passing the others.
Perhaps we see Frank sprawled out asleep already in his
underwear. We might see the Twins in their bunks. One of the
Twins' lower torso is laying outside of the blanket. He
casually flips the blanket over the kid's bare feet and
continues to his room.
Tom enters and closes the door. Turns on a stereo which plays
a cello piece by Yo-Yo Ma. Books fills his room. He sits at
his desk, puts on eye glasses and looks through some paperwork.
Suddenly he stops, looking over the paperwork, into space. A
thought passes by. We don't know what.
FADE OUT:
Grace is flicking the television -- repeating the only three
channels over and over...
Annie works at her computer, surrounded by work. She notices
the time, gets a thought and dials the phone...
ANNIE
Hello, Mr. Booker... Oh, hello, Frank.
This is Annie MacLean... I was
wondering, has-...
(listens)
Uh-huh... And Pilgrim?...
(listens)
Still?... Uh-huh...
(politely cheery)
Okay then. Thank you.
She hangs up, pauses, then speaks to the window out loud enough
for Grace to hear --
ANNIE
He's still sitting in that damn
field.
GRACE
(w/o looking at her)
I think they call it a pasture.
Annie looks at her as if to say the last thing I need to know is
a lesson on the local lingo...
ANNIE
Let's go see what's going on, then
get something to eat.
Everyone sits around the kitchen table. Joe, still wearing
his hat, eyes Annie and Grace with acute curiosity.
DIANE
Joe, take off the hat -- I'm not
going to say it again.
Joe obeys. Diane puts the last of the serving plates on the
table -- pork chops, potatoes, gravy, peas, bread... And a big
bowl of mixed salad. The boy can't help eyeing how the
"vegetarians" will act.
Annie and Grace eye the food. Annie reaches out for a serving
ladle, picking up Grace's plate to serve her as Grace reaches
for a piece of bread, when:
FRANK
Dear Lord, we are humbly thankful
for...
Annie and Grace freeze as Frank continues his prayer -- they
notice everyone's head bowed slightly.
FRANK
(continues)
these gifts. For the blessings on our
home, our family and our guests. Bless
those that aren't as fortunate. Bless
all God's creatures.
EVERYONE
Amen.
Everyone begins eating. Annie and Grace breath a sigh of relief.
Silence. Utensils hitting plates, the only sound.
FRANK
Bank out us a couple more men to run
the cattle.
TOM
We should be fine, then.
Beat. Annie and Grace listen...
JOE
Teacher asked me why we raise Black
Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
FRANK
Tell her they suit the weather better.
Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
TOM
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing
off the snow. And they're good mother.
FRANK
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Silence... Eating... Annie tries her hand at conversation:
ANNIE
You know, that's interesting. I always
wondered when I went into a restaurant
what was the difference between a regular
steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't
taste any difference although I could
swear one was more tender. I didn't know
there was that big a difference between
cows...
(silence)
I've never been on a cow farm before. I
must say, the bulls seem to have the
best time of it. Just laying around the
fields all day until they're asked to...
(uncomfortable)
do their... work.
FRANK
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety
percent chance of getting castrated and
served up as hamburger. On a balance I
reckon I'd choose being a cow.
(to Grace)
Would you mind passing that salad
young lady?
DIANE
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
ANNIE
(lying)
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't
get used to how dark it gets around here,
though. When we leave the ranch, I
always hold my breath until I can see
the motel.
FRANK
(innocently)
You know, Tom, while you're working on
that horse of theirs, Annie and Grace
should move into the old Creek house.
Diane and Tom react accordingly; Diane hiding her annoyance,
Tom hiding his surprise and pleasure.
FRANK
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be
driving back and forth when she don't
know her way around that well...
ANNIE
Oh, I don't know...
FRANK
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as
good as falling down around your ears.
DIANE
(overlapping)
They're already all settled in, Frank.
Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
FRANK
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be.
Tom?
TOM
I don't have a problem with that. It's up
to Annie.
ANNIE
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how
much longer do you think you need to work
with Pilgrim?
TOM
That's up to Pilgrim.
Everyone waits on Annie's answer as she considers this.
Grace is on the phone with Robert. Annie is packing things
up. Grace is telling him about the day;
GRACE
(listens)
I know. Me, too. Why don't you come
one weekend?
Annie reacts to this.
GRACE
We'll have more room because we're
moving onto the ranch. They have this
empty house near this creek. It's
actually pretty... OK... I love you.
(to Annie)
Dad wants to talk to you.
ANNIE
(takes the phone)
Hi.
INTERCUT
Robert is burning the midnight oil in the study with files
all around him.
ROBERT
Hey... She sounds like she's doing
all right. How is she?
Grace exits into the bathroom. Annie talks softly;
ANNIE
(cautious)
Yeah. She seems to be getting more
comfortable on the ranch, which is why
I said yes to this move. But, whenever
it's just the two of us, I don't know...
Anyway... what's happening with the
Delco lawsuit?
ROBERT
Taking forever. I just got an additional
list of sixty-two employees to interview
before Monday. I don't know how I'm going
to do it.
ANNIE
Well, it's good that you're there.
Robert didn't mean to validate his separation from them.
ROBERT
So, how are you doing in Marlboro
country? Is the magazine complaining at
all?
ANNIE
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy
tells me she thinks Gottchalks's
plotting, but what else is new.
ROBERT
When are you coming home?
ANNIE
You know, I just asked that myself
tonight. He doesn't know.
ROBERT
Well then... maybe I will take some
time... come visit.
ANNIE
Okay.
Beat. Annie knows Robert needed an invitation from her. But
she can't do it. Robert tries again.
ROBERT
I miss you, Annie.
ANNIE
I know. We miss you too.
ROBERT
Good night.
ANNIE
Night.
Awkwardly, they hang up. Grace exits the bathroom.
GRACE
Did you ask him to come visit?
ANNIE
You already did.
GRACE
Did he mention it?
ANNIE
(resumes packing)
Yeah, he's going to think about it.
You want me to pack for you?
Grace looks at her disapprovingly as she passes to go to the
bathroom. Annie registers this.
Diane is washing windows while listening to an audio book on
her tape player. Through the windows, she sees:
Joe and the Twins helping Annie and Grace move into the Creek
House.
Diane has conflicting feelings about this. She continues her
work.
VARIOUS SHOTS of ANNIE CONNECTING HERSELF BACK TO THE REST OF
THE WORLD, BY PLUGGING IN HER COMPUTER, FAX, ETC...
Grace is in the other room, as she was in the motel. Alone.
With no television, she is just listening to her music laying
on the couch. The two women remain separate no matter where
they are.
But we see a small difference. Grace rises and walks to the
window. She looks out;
POV: She sees people working about the ranch. Maybe Joe is
among them -- riding his horse as he works. Or maybe it's
just a vision of people with tasks to complete -- who do so
with pride, discipline and clarity.
Grace looks out the window longingly.
The Women are bringing in dishes and plates and food from the
tables through the house and into the kitchen. Annie is among
them, feeling apart of the group. She enters carrying a large
bowl, that held the corn.
Diane is replacing newly-cleaned forks and knives in her
dining room drawers, above which are several FAMILY PICTURES.
ANNIE
(referring to clean bowl)
Where does this go, Diane?
DIANE
Oh, you can just set up on the dining
table. I have to rearrange my shelves
tomorrow.
Annie complies. She notices the framed pictures on the wall in
the dining room.
ANNIE
Is this Mr. Booker? Tom's
grandfather?
Diane looks at a faded photo circa late 1800's.
DIANE
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died
before Frank and I met. This here's...
(another photo)
Frank and Tom's mother and father...
there's little Frank and Tom...
ANNIE
She calls him Tommy...
DIANE
Always did. I think she favored him a
little. You tend to when you have more
than one, even though you love 'em all
the same.
She studies the old faces of Tom's Parents -- although 20th
Century people, there is still a pioneering strength in their
visage... a stoicism and power.
DIANE
(putting away forks)
Ha, she loves telling this story about
how when he was two years old, he ran off.
They found him in the barn, sleeping
between two giant hooves of a Percheron
stallion. She said that horse was
protecting him and nobody could convince
her otherwise.
ANNIE
I got a little confused though. The ranch
Ellen was talking about -- that's not this
one?
Diane is sorting silverware throughout the following:
DIANE
No. See, Frank and Tom were raised near
the Clark's Fork River, right between the
Pryor and Beartooth Mountains. Beautiful
piece of land. But they had this uncle
Ned -- useless man, never interested in
ranching. And when the grandparents died,
he left for the city and sent word
through lawyers he wanted his claim to
the land so he could sell it. Three years
of legation broke their father. Frank took
it all in stride, but Tom... Tom loved that
land. I don't think he ever got over it --
His home being sold out from under him.
Seeing his father like that. Once he and
Frank got their folks set up in a new
place, Tom left... went off. We didn't see
him for years...
Annie is intrigued by what she's learning about Tom.
Something outside the window catches her eyes. She watches:
POV;
Tom and Frank, on either side to Ellen, are escorting her to
a car that will drive her home.
Grace is fast asleep, exhausted. She does not stir when the
phone rings.
Annie picks up from her own bed, awakened, still dressed in
her branding clothes, having just passed out on the bed.
ANNIE
Hello?
INTERCUT: Robert, alone, in the vast apartment.
ROBERT
I thought you guys were going to call
me.
ANNIE
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired
from the branding. Grace barely made it
to her bed and I didn't have the energy
to take my clothes off.
ROBERT
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
ANNIE
Everything all right.
ROBERT
Huh-huh. You?
ANNIE
Fine. Actually, today was a good day.
You should have seen her.
ROBERT
I wish I did.
The sound of self-pity was so obvious for both of them, so
Robert quickly re-groups, resorting to something he knows is
important to her;
ROBERT
Well, uh the real reason I called,
actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy
at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very
worried.
ANNIE
About what?
ROBERT
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around
town lunching with some very prominent
magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to
call you, but no one answered so she faxed
you the list of names. She said one of
them have contracts up fairly soon.
ANNIE
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We
left before sunrise.
ROBERT
Honey, I hope you're not endangering
your position. Listen, if you need to
come back and you want me to come take
over, for a while, I'll work it out. I
mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but
the magazine's got only one of you.
After a day of hard work and simple pleasures, Annie begins to
succumb to old anxieties and pressures.
Annie is awake reading the faxes Lucy sent. One after other.
As she flips through them, one falls to the floor near the bed.
She gets down on all fours to retrieve and sees something
under the bed. AN OLD, BATTERED CELLO CASE. She pulls it out
to find the initials R.B. carved on the top. She opens it to
find papers, receipts, bills -- all from Tom's married life.
A tense Annie is having a difficult phone with DAVID GOTTSCHALK;
ANNIE
... David, we've been behind a day or
two before. But Lucy just Fedexed me all
the material and it'll be approved by
the end of the day.
DAVID GOTTSCHALL (V.O.)
If nothing goes wrong. If the faxes don't
go down. If the phone lines are opened.
I can't have this magazine hitting the
streets by the skin of its ass, Annie.
During David's lines, Diane has entered, carrying fresh towels
-- she crosses into the bathroom.
ANNIE
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The
work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps
me on top of everything.
DAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.)
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something
without you being here. Now, I know this
is a rough time for you, but I think we
should make another arrangement.
Without Annie's awareness, Diane re-enters and takes her time
leaving, so she can take in all of Annie's things; her
business "office," books, etc...
ANNIE
What the hell does that mean? How much
more do I have to do to prove how
important this magazine is to me?
DAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.)
If this magazine is so important to you
Annie, why are you in Montana?
Diane can't help but notice a slight vulnerability in Annie.
DAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.)
Look, this is what we're going to do.
Finish up this issue. I'll set up a
conference call in a few weeks. Just
you, me and your lawyer and we'll
just work this out so that everyone
will be taken care of. Fair enough?
Annie is now aware of Diane's presence and chooses to play it
cool. It's not the moment.
ANNIE
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
DAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.)
All right. Speak to you then.
He hangs up. Annie forces a smile to Diane.
ANNIE
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
DIANE
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that,
if you'd like, you being so busy, I
could take Grace to her therapy
exercises for you. I have to go in
once a week for shopping anyway.
Annie doesn't know whether or not to accept.
ANNIE
Oh... Well... thank you very much. I
don't --
Before she finishes her line, the Phone Rings again.
ANNIE
Sorry.
(to phone)
Hello? Hi, yeah, I just spoke to him.
Oh, you know David, Mr. Strong Arm...
Diane feels out of place and exits. Annie doesn't notice
until she hears the door close. She pushes back her hair and
takes a deep breath. She looks out through the side window
and sees:
Grace and Joe doing chores. Grace looks involved and not at
all self-conscious. A moment of gratitude and calm for Annie.
Grace doesn't know what to do.
TOM
Put the key in and turn it.
(Grace obeys)
The right pedal is gas, the other
one's the brake.
GRACE
I don't know if I can with my leg.
TOM
Well, there's only one way to find out.
(puts truck in gear)
Give it a little gas.
She awkwardly puts her prosthetic foot on the gas pedal. Too
much. It lurches forward. She takes her foot off.
TOM
Well, we know you can. Now you just
got to feel how much. Try it again.
She does. They slowly, very slowly, move along the dirt road.
TOM
Nice, real nice. There's a little
road down at the end here, turn onto
it.
Grace badly oversteers, but makes the turn. She drives along
the road, across a pasture, heading toward distant mountains.
TOM
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm
going to shut my eyes here for a
little while. Just keep going till
you run out of road.
GRACE
(afraid)
I don't know if I can.
TOM
Not a question of if you can -- you
are. Just keep your eyes on the road
and your foot on the pedal and the
rest will take care of yourself.
Folding his arms over his chest, shutting his eyes, Tom
relaxes back. Grace locks her hand on the steering wheel and
her eyes straight ahead...
Grace is standing by the window, looking out at them. Their
movements indicate an intimacy that upsets her.
Grace watches her mother stand there a moment, then turn and
walk towards the house. Grace moves away from the window,
her emotions churning -- jealousy, anger -- and enters her
bedroom, shutting the door.
DISSOLVE TO:
Annie is in the midst of making a spaghetti dinner. She's a
little frazzled but she's on top of it. Grace enters wearing
a lovely dress -- it is the first time we have seen her in a
dress. Annie hears her enter before she sees her, asking;
ANNIE
Honey, would you see if anybody
wants --
Annie notices Grace standing there, in her dress. She stops.
ANNIE
You look really pretty.
Grace is a little self-conscious but grateful. She begins
taking forks out of her dress pocket.
GRACE
I thought there were too many forks
on the table.
ANNIE
Well, one was for salad...
GRACE
Mom, they don't mind eating with one
fork.
ANNIE
(thinks, then;)
You're right. Good.
Grace puts them away.
ANNIE
Does anybody out there want
something to drink?
GRACE
I'll take care of it.
ANNIE
Thanks, honey.
Grace nods and exits to the living room.
LIVING ROOM:
The room is silent because every Booker is READING A
DIFFERENT COPY OF ANNIE'S MAGAZINE. Frank covertly glimpses
at the scantily-clad models... The Twins sharing a magazine,
doing the same thing as their father, but keeping an eye out
for mom... Diane is looking at pictorial exposes on the kind
of lives she only hears about on audio tapes...
Tom sits off to the side, amused by the sight.
Grace enters as Joe enters. They nod across the room to each
other with a little smile.
GRACE
Would anyone like something to drink?
We hear a CRASH in the kitchen, then:
ANNIE (O.S.)
SHIT!
Everybody looks up for a minute. The Twins giggle. Diane gives
them a dirty look.
TOM
I'll give your mom a hand.
Diane watches him enter the kitchen, then returns to her
magazine.
Annie has dropped a hot pot into the sink, after pouring the
tomato out of it, and into a terrine.
TOM
Everything under control?
ANNIE
(laughs)
Not really. I'd forgotten how long
it's been since I've done this. And
I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
TOM
Just make yourself comfortable.
ANNIE
I am comfortable.
TOM
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess
you can bring out the pasta.
She undoes her apron and crosses towards the bowl. Tom's eyes
never leave her. It's the first time he's seen her in her
dress, sans apron. As she lifts the bowl to hand to him, she
realizes he's been looking at her. There's a silent moment,
then;
ANNIE
You missed a button.
TOM
Huh?
She looks for it. Tom crosses to her and buttons it, then
takes the bowl.
ANNIE
Thank you.
They're quiet for a beat as they exchange a look. Suddenly,
Grace enters -- she clearly doesn't like the two of them being
alone, Annie quickly covers;
ANNIE
Oh, good, Grace, would you bring in
the bread... I'll get the salad and
then we're all set.
Tom has already exited by the time Annie finishes, and Grace
grabs the bread basket.
We parachute into the middle of the meal. The spaghetti is a
hit... We cut to different conversations and reactions around
the table.
Frank is in the middle of saying;
FRANK
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay
the feed end of the month...
TOM
I don't think Warren would go for that.
Grace is talking to Joe and the Twins.
GRACE
... like, for instance, you can go on
the Internet and access this thing
called The Visible Man -- who was this
murderer they caught in Texas that was
executed and donated his body to
science and you can call him up on the
screen and dissect him, like in Three-D...
Grace eats as she talks. Joe and the Twins are fascinated.
Annie asks Tom, Frank and Diane;
ANNIE
Well, did you ever think about hiring
a business manager?
FRANK
We have a business manager. The best
around.
DIANE
Ha...
TOM
Diane takes care of the books. I don't
know how, but at the end of every
month, everything adds up to the penny.
DIANE
Ain't brain surgery.
ANNIE
It's pretty impressive. Where I come
from, you'd be a gold mine.
Diane doesn't know how to accept that, but inside she's
bursting with pride. She focuses on the Twins who fight;
TWINS
This is MY fork. That's YOUR fork, ya
idiot!
DIANE
Hey. You stop that kind of talk at the
table.
FRANK
I'll have another round of that
spaghetti if may?
ANNIE
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
DIANE
I uh... I like the sauce very much. Maybe
I get the recipe.
Annie is so pleased and is about to reply, but Grace, noticing
Tom smiling at Annie:
GRACE
It's from a jar.
There's an odd silence as a deflated Annie serves Frank.
FRANK
Thank you.
Finally, Diane saves it.
DIANE
Well, I tried jar sauce once --
wasn't this good. Ya gotta know
which brand to buy. I'd like to
get the name of this one.
Annie is grateful. Grace feels foolish.
TWIN (SCOTT)
Can we see the dead body on the
screen?
DIANE
What?
GRACE
It's just my computer.
DIANE
Oh, I don't --
ANNIE
It's okay. Grace, show them. I'm going
to put the coffee on. I made an apple
tart for dessert.
The Twins excitedly move to the computer. Joe waits for Grace.
DIANE
I'll help you with the coffee.
ANNIE
Well... I know I should reject that
offer, but I'm not going to.
DIANE
(jovial)
No reason you should, no reason you
should.
They exit into the kitchen. Frank continues eating.
Tom looks around -- Grace showing the boys the computer. Annie
and Diane in the kitchen. For a second, we see Tom realize an
image of the life he once thought he could.
As Diane and Annie prepare coffee and dessert;
DIANE
I was looking in one of your magazines
and saw that picture of the couple
getting married at the Pyramids. Were
you ever in Egypt?
ANNIE
I was there for that shot, actually.
DIANE
What was it like?
ANNIE
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth
or fifth time I'd been there, so all
I remember was the heat and how
incompetent the photographer was...
She laughs as she directs this last line to Diane, who just
smiles. And Annie realizes that's not what she meant at all.
This woman is starving for glimpses into this other life.
ANNIE
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like
nothing else. It's like going back in
time.
(Diane listens)
I remember as a kid trying to imagine
what a kid my age, centuries ago,
walking over that same ground, was
wondering about or, if they had the
same problems as me... and I felt,
connected to... to time itself, almost.
Ha, I never realized how hard it was
to describe.
DIANE
I'd love to go there one time...
ANNIE
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
DIANE
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri
to see my cousin Emma married. Frank
loves in there.
Annie can sense the disappointment in her voice, and at the
same time, the comfortable resignation.
Suddenly, from inside, they hear LOUD OVERLAPPING VOICES as
the children fight.
TWIN (SCOTT)
IT WAS MY TURN!
JOE
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
TWIN (SCOTT)
WAS SO!
LIVING ROOM:
Diane and Annie enter to find Joe and Scott fighting, as Tom
tries to break them up...
TOM
Boys! Settle down!
TWIN (SCOTT)
You never let me have a turn!
JOE
Don't be such a baby!
TWIN (SCOTT)
You just showing off for her!
JOE
You shut up, stupid!
TWIN (SCOTT)
You're the one who's stupid -- letting
her go and fall off your horse!!
Everyone goes quiet, except for the computer screen.
JOE
You little shit!
DIANE
JOE!
TWIN (SCOTT)
I saw 'em. In the pasture. Her trying to
get on Gonzo! I saw 'em.
ANNIE
What does he mean?
GRACE
Nothing.
ANNIE
Did you go riding?
JOE
Little shit!
Joe lunges for Scott and the two start rolling in a fight.
Frank and Tom work to pull them apart as Diane yells.
DIANE
Annie, I'm so sorry, but they're just
tired. We'll have dessert another time.
Frank, get them out of here.
(to other Twin)
Come on. Say good night and thank
you...
Voices everywhere. Yelling. "Thank you's!!" During which,
Grace quickly turns and exits. Annie eyes follow her out of
the room, but with her guests and the chaos, she doesn't know
whether or not to leave.
FRANK
Dinner was delicious. Thank you.
(to Twins)
Say thank you!!
Diane and Frank usher the kids out. Tom holds onto Joe until
they're gone, then lets him go.
JOE
Sorry, ma'am, I thank you for dinner.
It was very good.
ANNIE
Did Grace try to ride, Joe?
JOE
(hesitates)
I expect you should talk to Grace about
that, ma'am. And if I did anything
wrong, then I am sorry.
Ever the gentlemen, Joe exits. Annie looks to Tom. He's about
to leave, when he stops and says:
TOM
Don't let her turn you away.
Tom exits.
Annie stands and faces Grace's closed door. Slowly, she
lowers herself to her knees and sits on them, thinking...
reminiscent of Tom, waiting for his moment with Pilgrim, in
the field.
We don't know how long Annie waited, but she knocks gently,
then enters to find Grace, in her nightgown, on her bed, with
the night stand light on. Her prosthesis is against the wall.
ANNIE
Grace? Is everything all right?
(no answer)
Can we talk?
GRACE
About what?
ANNIE
Well...
(nervous)
So you tried riding again?
GRACE
(snotty)
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
ANNIE
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
GRACE
... You worried everything all right
now and we'll have to go home?
ANNIE
What are you talking about?
GRACE
You... not wanting to go home because
you hate daddy so much.
ANNIE
Grace, I don't hate your father.
GRACE
I can't remember the last time you
made him dinner.
ANNIE
I was just trying to say thank you to
Diane and Frank and --
GRACE
Tom?
Annie sits by the bed, Grace moves away a little.
ANNIE
Look, I just wanted to say, I think
it's great you're riding again.
And... and I think I know why you,
you needed to do it alone... without
anyone knowing...
GRACE
Yeah, you know everything!!
ANNIE
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
GRACE
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like
you care! Like this really isn't about
you and Tom.
ANNIE
(angry)
WHAT?! How can you --
(at a loss)
I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom
bothers you so much, but I happen to
value having someone to talk to,
especially when my own daughter
ignores me night and day because no
matter what I say, it's wrong and no
matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm
sorry I'm such a disappointment to
you.
GRACE
Well, now you know what it feels like.
Beat.
ANNIE
I don't deserve that. I have never
looked at you as a disappointment. If
I'm on your back to do better, if I
push you to try harder it's because
I want you to be the best you can be.
GRACE
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter
which means you're the best mother!
Isn't that what you're always talking
about in interviews -- having it all,
the great career, the great family...
Proving everybody wrong. Wanting
everybody to think you're this perfect
woman!
Beat. They're both exhausted.
ANNIE
Listen, if... if there's a part of you
as parent that... that takes pride in
your child -- that, you can look at
them and see something you've
accomplished as well... if that's wrong,
then I'm sorry.
(no answer)
But it wasn't my intention. I don't push
for me. I do it for you... So you don't
waste half your life feeling like you
don't know where you belong.
GRACE
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
Beat. Annie feels deeply hurt.
ANNIE
Well, then I do apologize... But what
I'm most sorry for is turning you
into a spoiled brat who can only
think about what she's feeling... who
can't admit when she's wrong and who
can't forgive when she's not.
GRACE
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
Annie stops to exit as Grace says something under her breath.
Annie stops.
ANNIE
What did you say?
GRACE
I said... I started.
Grace starts to sob. Annie doesn't understand.
ANNIE
Started what?
GRACE
My period.
ANNIE
(softer)
When? Tonight?
GRACE
(nods)
I felt it happen downstairs and when
I went into the bathroom.
Annie reaches down to touch Grace's shoulder. Grace turns --
there is no anger in her face. Annie sits and takes her in
her arms. Grace clings to her and sobs like a little girl.
Annie sees tears run -- gratefully, lovingly.
GRACE
Who's going to want me now?
ANNIE
What?... Oh baby...
GRACE
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody
will.
ANNIE
That's not true.
GRACE
Why should they?
ANNIE
Because you are... one of the most...
incredible, bravest, most beautiful
woman I have ever met. The efforts
you make. Your courage and your
dignity.
(laughs thru tears)
I don't know where you got it? I
honestly don't know how I would have
handled all this if I were you.
Grace is so grateful, they cling to each other even harder.
As the tears subside, Grace manages to admit...
GRACE
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's
just that -- all those times you
and Daddy were trying for another
kid, I... I used to pray at night that
it would work. And not because of
you guys or that I wanted a brother
or sister... but... just so I wouldn't
have to be...
ANNIE
What?
GRACE
So special. Because I was the only
one. You both wanted me to be so
good at everything, so perfect and
I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've
completely ruined everything,
anyway...
They both start crying again as Annie rocks her gently.
ANNIE
Sshhh... Ssshhhh...
They hold each other as if for dear life...
LATER -- CAMERA PANS to discover mother and daughter, fast
asleep, in each other's arms.
Tom sits alone, writing at his desk. His music is playing.
He stops to look out the window overlooking the Creek House.
Annie and Grace fell asleep with the lights still on in the
living room.
Tom is thinking of Grace and Annie -- wondering what happened
after he left... conflicted by what he feels for Annie... And
remembering why they're here in the first place...
DISSOLVE TO:
The phone rings, awakening Annie first, then Grace.
ANNIE
Hello?
OPERATOR (V.O.)
Hello, this is ATT Conference Service.
Is this Annie MacLean?
ANNIE
Yes.
OPERATOR (V.O.)
I have a conference call scheduled for
you with Mr. Gottschalk and Mr. Farlow.
ANNIE
(remembering)
Oh. Oh, yes. One moment, please.
GRACE
Who is it?
ANNIE
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up
in the other room -- would you hang
this up for me?
GRACE
Sure.
Annie moves to the other room, sits down at her office space,
takes a breath, then picks up, yelling to Grace;
ANNIE
Okay, Grace...
(click)
Operator?... I'm ready.
Grace is cleaning stalls, etc... She exits one of the stalls
with a pail and stops -- looking down the barn to where she
knows Pilgrim is. She places the pail down and gathers her
courage. She walks to Pilgrim's stall. She stands motionless
for some moments before she opens the doors and enters...
Pilgrim steps back a bit. He looks at her. He pins his ears
back. Stomps his feet. Grace is about to turn and leave, but
she stops herself and remains still.
Slowly, she reaches out to touch Pilgrim's head... and he
lets her. We see in Grace a maturity of character, a
willingness to face what she must face... the beginning of a
compassion, not only for Pilgrim, but perhaps for herself as
well.
Grace sits at the table. Tom is cooking at the stove. It feels
as if they are the only two people on earth. Grace gets up her
nerve... and begins:
GRACE
Judith was telling me about this boy
she really liked. She never even had
a chance to tell me his name...
She starts to quietly cry, but it doesn't stop her.
GRACE
We were going to go around by the
railroad bridge...
And we see the accident all over again... But this time, a
movie -- as clear as reality -- but in deathly silence. Just
the sound of Grace's voice, and her heartbeat...
Grace sobs uncontrollably now.
GRACE
Judith... Oh God, Judith. I'm sorry...
Tom is near and holds her as she puts her head on his chest.
TOM
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling
this bad... But I can tell you, you
didn't do anything wrong... The same
thing would have happened to me... or
Frank... or Joe... And there's no
sense in looking for a reason why
things happen...
(self-reflective)
I used to try and... always came up
short. I don't think the why so's
important as... what we do with what
we get. I remember this boy I'd see
up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He
was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd
gone swimming and dived headfirst into
a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed
him... After the accident, I'd look
in on him from time to time... and he
wasn't there anymore. His mind, his
spirit, whatever you want to call it,
it just disappeared. And what was left
was nothing but anger... It's like the
boy I knew just went away somewhere...
GRACE
I know where he goes.
TOM
I know you do. Don't you disappear.
(holds her tighter)
You do whatever you have to, to hold
on...
(thinks)
I'll tell you one more thing... When
Pilgrim reared up to face that
truck... you know what I think?... I
think that damn horse loved you so much,
he was trying to protect you... That's
what I think.
Grace listens to this. As Tom holds her in silence, it's
almost as if they were father and daughter...
Diane is busy in the kitchen when Annie enters.
ANNIE
Is there anything you need? I'm going
food-shopping.
DIANE
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
ANNIE
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a
list.
Annie is determined. She needs to be by herself for a bit.
Grace is in the stall with Pilgrim. Once again, close enough
to touch him, which he allows.
Outside the stall, stand Robert and Tom. Robert squeezes his
splinter...
ROBERT
I can't believe it's the same horse.
TOM
We still have a way to go.
ROBERT
How much longer do you think?
Tom understands this man wants his family back.
TOM
Well, like I told your wife, it's
really up to Pilgrim.
ROBERT
I understand...
DISSOLVE TO:
Everyone is seated around the table, eating, talking, laughing.
Grace is right by her father's side. Frank's in the middle of
telling Robert:
FRANK
We thought we lost him in the snow
storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral
for the damn thing. Finally, snow
stops. Staring to warm up. I go out
and start cleaning the truck...
Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out
from the back seat covered in snow...
I nearly stained myself.
TOM
He thought it was a ghost.
JOE
A dog ghost!
Laughter all around.
DISSOLVE TO:
Grace is asleep. Robert sits by her bed, lit by the moon
through a window. He stares at this creature he loves so
much. He rises and enters Annie's room.
ROBERT
Tired?
Annie shrugs. Robert looks at the bed. He teases.
ROBERT
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in
the barn.
ANNIE
(teases back)
You're allergic to hay.
ROBERT
(smiles)
I apologize for the surprise, but the
days only opened yesterday and I
figured...
ANNIE
You don't have to explain. You have
every right to come.
ROBERT
I can see why you put your faith in
him. He's a genuine... good guy...
Good at what he does. That's rare.
Annie nods. She tries to hide her discomfort. Robert sits on
the bed before her.
ROBERT
You were right about coming here. I'm
sorry for not thinking...
ANNIE
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were
plenty of times I didn't know what
the hell was right.
ROBERT
How are you feeling about work?
ANNIE
Let's not talk about that now.
And they're quiet. He moves to kiss her. It's awkward. They
look to each other -- as they try to remember how to make love
together...
ROBERT
I feel like I'm on a first date.
Annie smiles sympathetically.
Tom and Grace continue dancing. She's in heaven. Robert
approaches and Tom quickly allows him to take over. Grace
loves the attention from both men. As they dance off, Tom
crosses the dance floor and is met by Hank's wife;
HANK'S WIFE
Oh Tom, would you check the shed and see
if there's anymore chairs.
TOM
Sure.
Diane is once more sitting at the kitchen table, looking over
some bills before bed. Her tape player is on softly. Tom
enters and crosses to the sink to get a glass of water.
Diane looks up, seeing Tom with his back to her -- standing at
the sink, filling his glass -- staring out the window over the
sink. She looks to the dish of brownies on the table.
DIANE
I have some brownies left over. Want
one?
TOM
(w/o turning around)
No thanks.
Diane senses an uneasiness in Tom. She looks as he drinks his
water.
MEDIUM CLOSE-UP ON TOM'S BACK, as if from Diane's POV.
But when we pull back we find ourselves;
Tom is standing in front of Pilgrim's stall. He opens the
door. They look at each other. He strokes him and begins to
whisper;
TOM
There's something you have to do
tomorrow, boy...
Camera gently moves away... and Tom whispers to Pilgrim what
must be done...
In the midst of packing, Annie has made dinner for Grace and
Robert. In the midst of eating, Robert asks:
ROBERT
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
GRACE
I did. He said he had work to do
until late.
Annie remains silent.
She moves to his stall and opens the doors. He stands there,
without any fear of her. She smiles and enters. She wraps her
arm around his neck, pets him and whispers.
GRACE
I'll see you home... OK?
Everything is being packed up. Robert is dressed for travel.
Annie is taping up the boxes containing her computer
equipment.
ANNIE
Are you going to stay in the city or
go up to Connecticut?
ROBERT
Connecticut. I told the office I'd
work out of there next week. When are
you planning to start back?
ANNIE
Probably first thing in the morning.
It's too late to start now. I'm going
to try not to do too much driving in
the dark.
ROBERT
May I have a suggestion?
ANNIE
Yeah, what?
ROBERT
Take your time.
ANNIE
(innocently)
What do you mean?
Annie looks up from the box to see Robert is calmly staring
at her. His demeanor is different. Something's going on.
ANNIE
You look like something's wrong.
This is Robert's moment. He knows it. He takes a breath and
hopes it comes out right:
ROBERT
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I
stood there looking at what was
happening to that horse... And, I
swear, it felt like the same thing
was happening to me.
ANNIE
I don't understa-
ROBERT
(continues)
And I have two choices. I can either
fight the way things are, or accept
them.
(Annie waits; he smiles)
See, I always knew I loved you more.
Didn't bother me. I always felt
lucky... a little amazed... that such
a vibrant, beautiful woman would want
to be with a man like me... And I
guess I thought as long as I did
everything right -- if I was the best
husband I could be, the best father...
even being a good lawyer only mattered
to me because of what it meant for
us... if I could do all that, it
wouldn't make any difference if we
loved each other the same or not...
I wasn't asking for more. I told myself
I didn't need more.
(smiles)
But you don't know how you feel about
me. You don't know... if you want a
life with me anymore...
(bravely)
And I don't want you to come home
until you do know...
(the hard part)
... one way or the other.
Annie cannot remember a time when she ever loved her husband
more than in this moment -- knowing what it took for him to
say this. She would not disrespect it with denials. Her
throat is choked with tears, she swallows down. She nods.
Robert nods, feeling both pride and heartbreak in the same
moment. He picks up his bag, kisses her goodbye and exits.
A light goes on. Annie enters, cautiously. She's never been
in this room. She crosses to the desk, touches it. She
notices a tape player and pushes it on. MUSIC PLAYS... She
sees a small framed photo -- of Tom's son, years ago.
Suddenly, she feels like an intruder. She shuts the music off
and exits...
Annie faces Pilgrim... she gently lifts her hand and caresses
his face. He returns her gentleness. Annie is remembering
Robert's words, her heart is heavy with conflict. She jokes:
ANNIE
Why do I get the feeling you know
what I should do, but you're not
telling me?
She hears a truck pull up... Then, a door open and close. Her
heart races...
Tom leads her to his room. Annie cups his grasp on her with
both hands. He opens the door for her, ushers her in, then
closes the door. He hangs his hat. She turns to him. They
embrace, surrendering to each other's passions.
DISSOLVE TO:
Camera pas from Tom's window, bright with dawn, past his
desk upon which his classical music is playing, over to the
two lovers in bed, kissing and embracing. Then:
ANNIE
Oh, God, what are we going to do?
I'm supposed to --
TOM
Ssshhh...
(she stops)
Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've
got, just for now. Can you do that?
Beat. She nods. The permission Tom is giving her acts like a
great burden being lifted, and for the time being, she
surrenders and accepts the gift of what they feel. They kiss.
ANNIE HAS UNPACKED HER COMPUTER AND HOOKED IT UP, SHOWING
TOM HOW TO USE IT. HE PUSHES THE THRONG BUTTON AND MAKES A
FRIGHTENED FACE... ANNIE SCREAMS, THEN LAUGHS AND HUGS HIM.
DISSOLVE TO:
THEY ARE MAKING LOVE ON A BLANKET AMIDST OF THE MOVING BOXES IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
-- ANNIE COOKING LUNCH IN THE KITCHEN, SEEING TOM WORKING WITH
SMOKEY...
Tom and Annie make love...
ANNIE (V.O.)
I won't.
But there is a difference in their lovemaking. There's a
slowness, a reverence... a sense of two people so bounded, that
they are outside of time... Their love is so strong it almost
feels like despair -- their need to connect has gone beyond
their bodies and into their spirits, for which there is no
earthly satisfaction.
Annie awakens in bed and discovers she is alone. She looks
around for Tom. She rises and enters the other room to
discover:
All her boxes and all her luggage have been removed.
Her heart sinks. Tom re-enters, fully dressed, to get the
last box. He sees on her face a look of confusion and hurt.
TOM
I figured, whenever you decided to
go, you'd be all set.
ANNIE
(curt)
How thoughtful of you. And what if
I decide not to go?
Tom doesn't know how to respond. He looks away and bends down
to reach for the box when Annie commands:
ANNIE
Leave me alone!
Beat. They stand awkwardly for a moment, until;
TOM
(pleadingly)
Annie, please...
Tom reaches to embrace her, but Annie attacks him. Punching
his chest... pulling at his shirt as Tom tries to put his
arms around her...
ANNIE
NO!... NO!... YOU DON'T DECIDE
THIS!... NO!...
Tom's heart is breaking as he manages to get his arms around
her and hold her... as she breaks down and softly, the rage
passes... Annie speaks softly.
TOM
(struggling)
I don't know any other way, Annie.
ANNIE
(more adamant)
Why?
Suddenly;
TOM
You think this is easy for me!?
Annie is struck by the powerful sincerity of his words;
TOM
It's just happened this way sometimes.
I can't explain it. But I look at you
and see Grace and I see Robert, and
no matter what you decide about him,
I just know this is right. Your life
isn't here and you know it.
Annie looks into his eyes and asks, softly defiant;
ANNIE
Then what have we been doing? I mean
what was the point?
TOM
(confused by her question)
The point was to love each other.
ANNIE
Why?
As if there has to be a result... Tom looks at her and says
with an almost innocent conviction:
TOM
Because we had to... And I'll never
stop loving you, Annie. Here. Where
my life is.
The simplicity, and truth, of it hits Annie strongly.
Annie releases herself from him and turns away... despondent.
Realizing the utter truth and inevitability of what he says.
She starts shaking her head. Tom can't hear it... He reaches
for her;
TOM
Annie...
She turns back into his arms and they kiss passionately...
holding each other... as if for the last time.
Tom enters the barn slowly. He crosses to Rimrock's stall...
then stops. As if he is waiting. As if he knows...
Then... he hears the sound of Annie's Suburban starting up. He
looks up and knows she's leaving. He waits.
Annie doesn't look back -- her eyes wet with tears -- but no
sobs.
Tom lowers his head. It is not his way to say goodbye. And he
is moved by Annie's knowing.
A much younger Annie waits, surrounded by luggage, as A DOOR
OPENS revealing a much younger, more vital, very handsome
Robert:
ROBERT
Yes?
ANNIE
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any
hotel room available and someone told
me to come here and ask for "Tubab"
who might to have a place for me to
stay. Are you "Tubab"?
ROBERT
No. I am a "tubab."
ANNIE
What do you mean?
ROBERT
Tubab means white man.
Annie is first surprised, then embarrassed but Robert seems so
charming and his smile breaks into a laugh, that she just nods
and laughs herself.
Over a meal, Robert talks excitedly of his experiences. Annie
is captivated.
After Annie and Robert have made love, Robert sleeps with his
arms wrapped around Annie. She lies awake, feeling safe and
loved.
FADE OUT:
