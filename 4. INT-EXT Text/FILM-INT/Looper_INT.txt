Cavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch,
opens it, and dumps him in.
2.
JOE (V.O.)
And so. Thirty years from now. My
employers in the future nab the
target, they zap him back to me,
their looper. And I do the
necessaries. So the target has
vanished from the future, and I've
just disposed of a body that
technically does not exist. Clean.
The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little
flare of angry red fire.
Nearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones. A
waitress sets down coffee.
Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX.
BEATRIX
Bon jour, Joe.
JOE
Bon jour, Beatrix.
BEATRIX
How's the French?
JOE
Slow. How's the coffee?
BEATRIX
Burnt.
Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down.
Grungy, heavily fortified. Joe enters and puts his gun in a
basket labeled LOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSES
Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with
a protruding duct taped camera and microphone.
JOE
Two, Jedd.
3.
Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket.
A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old
hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again.
In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open.
The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash.
Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper.
DALE
Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?
JOE
Yup.
Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves
his gun and exits.
DALE
Four, Jedd.
High ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city.
Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a
coffee table in place over it.
Puts a bebop LP on a turntable.
LATER
On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.
JOE
Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!
Suit-and-tie Joe pulls a tarp off a cherried-out 1992 Mazda
Miata. Lingers over it. His baby.
A long dark hallway leads to a tiny antechamber with a coat
check room used for guns. BIG CRAIG leans out of it, and
stops the two.
6.
BIG CRAIG
No loopers in the club on
Wednesdays, Joe. Gat men only.
Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him.
JOE
We'll stick backstage, just meeting
up. In and out.
BIG CRAIG
Packing your blunderbusses?
JOE
Hardly. Right Seth?
SETH
Hardly. I'm with Joe.
Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.
A claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages.
DANGEROUS MEN and half naked SHOW GIRLS weave through.
Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace. Seth
struggles to keep up.
SETH
So are we - hey -
Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.
An ornate parlor, LACY WOMEN entertaining men. A velvet
curtained doorway leads to back rooms.
Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular,
SUZIE. Bold dark eye makeup. A BIG MAN leads her off
through the curtains. Joe's eyes drop. Pained.
A fat MADAME doesn't look up from her ledger.
MADAME
No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat
Men only.
JOE
So I've read.
He ducks out.
7.
Joe plods. Dale, the Looper from the pawn shop, passes fast.
Curious, Joe follows. They pass Seth, who tails after them.
SETH
Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what-
Joe?
And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.
A starkly lit steep stairwell leads down. Five or six young
loopers gather at the top. Joe and Dale join them.
JOE
What?
DALE
Zach. In there right now, with
Abe.
Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his
eyes.
JOE
For what?
DALE
He closed his loop.
This lands heavily on Joe.
JOE
No shit?
The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another
looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder
then retracts into the door.
The loopers watch him in awe.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
There's a reason we're called
loopers.
Zach reaches the top of the stairs, a grin on his face.
JOE (V.O.)
This job doesn't tend to attract
the most forward thinking people.
ZACH
So are we celebrating?
At the bottom of the stairs, a skinny young thug in ratty
jeans. This is KID BLUE.
KID BLUE
No loopers on fucking Wednesdays!
The loopers collectively flip him off.
9.
ZACH
Suck one, kid!
Lurid and very loud mixture of a dance club and cabaret. One
by one the LOOPERS emerge from side exits, sneaking in.
Paupers at the feast.
Joe and several other Loopers pass around an EYE DROPPER.
Pupils slacken. The drug spins him into a slurred revelry.
Joe staggers out on the dance floor. Miles high.
An alarm wakes Joe, red-eyed.
In his bathrobe, Joe checks his apartment mailbox. A slip of
folded paper inside, with 14:30 handwritten on it.
Dressed now, Joe double-checks his french book for a phrase
and heads out.
Joe sits at a booth, the waitress Beatrix brings his coffee.
BEATRIX
Bon jour Joe.
JOE
Ravi de te voir, Beatrix.
BEATRIX
Ooh la la.
JEDD, 70s and knarled, sits in a tiny closet of a work room.
Following a BUZZ, Joe appears on a fuzzy monitor, standing in
the hall.
JOE (OVER SPEAKER)
Two, Jedd.
Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then
hands him out a small stack of cash.
Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number 2'.
All the other transactions have the number 4'.
Joe smooths out the oriental rug.
12.
Joe drinks with Dale, watches a group of Loopers celebrating
at another table.
DALE
What's that, fourth loop closed
this month?
Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his
eyebrows at passing ladies.
JOE
Fourth.
On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can
dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As
her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage.
Suzie weaves towards her dressing room. Joe catches her.
SUZIE
Hey.
JOE
You working a shift tonight?
SUZIE
Yeah.
(REALIZES)
Yeah, but one of the gat men bought
me out already. For the night.
JOE
Oh.
SUZIE
Sweetie. I gotta work.
She leaves him watching her go.
He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen
this whole exchange. The Kid smirks.
Joe bursts back into the club with a vengeance.
Joe staggers in. Not doing so hot.
13.
Looks at himself in the mirror. Eyes red as candy. He pops
open a hidden drawer next to his medicine cabinet, pulls out
an eye dropper and puts one in each.
A harsh POUNDING.
Joe, flopped on the bed, stirs. Then wakes with a jump,
shaky on his feet.
Goes to the door. A screen shows nobody in the hall outside.
Still punch-drunk, Joe listens. POUND POUND POUND. The
window. Joe slides it open. Seth tumbles in off the fire
escape.
JOE
Jesus, Seth.
SETH
They're gonna be here any minute,
are they here?
JOE
No, they're not here. Who?
SETH
Christ. Joe. Christ.
Joe's eyes focus a bit, he tunes in to the situation. Turns
the apartment lights off.
SETH (CONT'D)
(re: the lights)
What are you doing? Right. Smart.
JOE
Seth, sit down here.
CRASH! Seth knocks something over in the dark. Joe opens
the fridge, pale light. Seth sits at the kitchen table.
SETH
Late to my own funeral. Mom always
said...
JOE
Tell me now.
SETH
Christ, Joe. Late to my own
goddamn funeral. Can you help me?
14.
JOE
Seth, what did you do?
SETH
You can protect me a little, right?
Just so they don't... jeez. Oh
jeez. This is like a nightmare.
This is a nightmare.
JOE (V.O.)
I knew then what he did so I don't
know why I asked.
JOE (CONT'D)
What did you do?
Seth lifts his eyes to Joe.
SETH
He was singing.
SETH
Joe I can't even tell you. Looking
in his eyes. I had to let him
talk, then. I don't even remember
the words, but I remember believing
every one of them, or not even
believing, but submitting. I've
never felt that small before. I've
never felt that happy. He told me.
I remember, there's a new holy
terror boss-man in the future, and
he's closing all the loops. The
Rainmaker, they call him. He told
me.
(MORE)
15.
SETH (CONT'D)
Then he wanted a cigarette and I
untied him, and he gives me this
look. And he just starts running.
Seth breaks down crying.
JOE (V.O.)
This is called letting your loop
run. It's not a good thing.
SETH
What do I do? You're the only
friend I got Joe you gotta help me
JOE
You fucking idiot coming here.
Seth, sucker punched.
JOE (CONT'D)
You can't be here, I'll give you a
little money but you gotta
SETH
Joe? A little - where am I gonna -
JOE
You hop a freight train, you beat
it the hell out
POUND POUND POUND. On the door this time. Seth makes a sound
like he's going to die, Joe closes the fridge, hisses
JOE (CONT'D)
Shut up. Don't move.
Goes to the door. Two GAT MEN and Kid Blue stand outside.
KID BLUE
Open up Joe!
(to the gat man)
Watch the window.
16.
Joe spins from the door. Considers briefly.
JOE
I can't do anything for you Seth.
Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand.
SETH
No! You gotta hide me! Joe, hide
me, please Christ please Joe please
hide me tell em something to buy
time and I'll leave please-
POUND POUND POUND.
JOE
Hold on!
Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision. He
flips the lights on, and briskly pulls back his oriental rug.
A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad. He enters a code, opens it.
Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big
enough for a man. Seth scrambles in.
Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face,
framed by the gold bars, then closes the safe and smooths the
oriental rug.
POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door.
Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
apartment with over-eager purpose.
One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's
kitchen table. Kid Blue gets in Joe's face.
KID BLUE
That took awhile.
JOE
You think it's easy looking this
good?
KID BLUE
Tye's going to watch your apartment
while we go have a talk with Abe.
Joe grabs a jacket.
JOE
There's coffee in the tin.
TYE
Thank you.
Kid Blue leads Joe down the stairs and into the door at their
base.
Dingy with a few benches. In one wall three steep stairs
lead to a high door. Kid Blue knocks. Muffled voice from
WITHIN:
ABE (O.S.)
Two minutes.
LATER
Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid
stares daggers and spins his gun. Joe tries his best not to
engage.
KID BLUE
You know why they call that pea
shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's
impossible to hit anything farther
than 15 feet, and impossible to
miss anything closer. A gun for
fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat.
A gat has range. Accuracy.
His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than
Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome.
JOE
Alright, cut it out Kid. You're
gonna blow your foot off again.
The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins.
KID BLUE
You're right, it'd be real easy for
it to accidentally go off.
He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably.
JOE
C'mon.
KID BLUE
Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper.
Joe stifles a chuckle.
In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the
face. Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe.
Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory.
Lowers his gun.
18.
ABE (O.S.)
What the hell is going on out there-
The high door swings open fast, SMACKING Kid Blue hard on the
side of the head. His gun goes off, firing into the wall.
Out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room, guns drawn.
ABE, a sallow man in his 50s, appears in the high doorway.
KID BLUE
S'alright, s'alright.
Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again.
After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the
tension breaks.
ABE
Alright. Joe.
Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily.
ABE (CONT'D)
You didn't shoot your other foot
off, didja kid?
The door closes, and the gat men laugh at the Kid.
Cluttered, with a big desk. Joe sits, Abe hands him a
handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek.
ABE
My great grandfather always told my
grandfather, men's like spiders.
It's the little ones you gotta be
careful of.
JOE
Dunno I agree with that.
ABE
Oh yeah? Well. What the fuck did
my great grandfather know.
JOE (V.O.)
This man is from the future. He
was sent back here by the mob, a
one way ticket, to run the Loopers.
That's low effort even for Abe, so
to pass the time he recruited some
real muscle, the Gat Men. Now he
runs the city. Any other city,
that'd be impressive.
Abe settles in his chair. Regards Joe.
19.
ABE
How can you kids stand those
chokers? This, the cravats.
JOE
Ties.
ABE
Ridiculous. You're aware we don't
have a dress code.
JOE
(SHRUGS)
Fashion.
ABE
You know, you don't know, the
movies you're dressing like were
copying other movies. Goddamn 20th
century affectations, do something
new. Put a glowing thing around
your neck or use... rubberized..
(waves at Joe's suit)
Be new.
JOE
Okay.
A beat of silence.
JOE (CONT'D)
Well it was nice chatting with you
Abe.
ABE
I do like you, Joe. But we're sure
enough Seth paid you a visit we're
gonna hafta do something about
this.
JOE
Seth?
ABE
You're expecting we're gonna break
your fingers with a hammer or
something awful, and I'm going to
diffuse that tension right now,
that isn't going to happen. What's
going to happen is, I'm going to
talk for a little, not even that
long, then you're gonna give up
your friend.
JOE
My friend Seth? I'm confused.
20.
ABE
Well then I'll talk a little. You
know you were the youngest looper I
ever hired? You looked goddamn
ridiculous they said, the
blunderbuss up to here on you. But
I remember they brought you in, I
forget what it was for,
JOE
Watch shop.
ABE
That's yeah, you had rolled one of
our fronts, a watch shop. And they
had you, your arms pinned, this
kid. Like an animal. But you
looked at me, your hair stuck to
half your face so just this one eye
looking at me. And I thought
what's this kid lived through, what
he had taken away from him. What's
he lost. And I could see, like
seeing it happen clear as seeing
it, the bad path in front of you,
the bad version of your life. Like
a vision I saw it happen, you
turning bad. So I cleaned you up
and put a gun in your hand. I gave
you something that was yours.
JOE
You know I'm grateful, Abe.
Genuine. But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going.
ABE
I gave you something that was
yours. And I remember that kid,
and I think when you ask yourself
you ask who would I sacrifice for
what's mine, I think Seth is deep
and cozy inside that circle.
Pause. Both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk.
ABE (CONT'D)
That hammer's there for something
else later, that's not, it's a bad
coincidence.
JOE
Okay.
ABE
Show you how much I know you, I'm
not even gonna break you, just set
you back a ways.
(MORE)
21.
ABE (CONT'D)
We know you've been stashing half
your bars. Which is smart. You
give up Seth, or you give us half
your stash. For Seth.
Joe holds Abe's gaze for a moment, then his eyes drop and
it's over.
JOE
Will you kill him?
ABE
No. Would be too cataclysmic a
change to the future. What we'll
do is dangerous in that regard, but
not as dangerous as killing him,
and not by twice as having him run
free.
(BEAT)
Joe I let him run more than a few
days, the boys in the future get
nervous, then bing! my replacement
shows up. With a gun. So we'll do
what we have to do.
Silence.
JOE
Floor safe, beneath the rug. 6742.
One of the gat men quietly exits.
ABE
It's the little ones that get you.
Abe leads Joe out, past gat men and Kid Blue, smirking again.
ABE
Why don't you kill an hour, Joe.
On the house.
After Joe exits, Abe and Kid exchange looks.
ABE (CONT'D)
Call the doc.
Joe slumps in. Several girls, none of them Suzie.
MADAME
Suzie's just getting off. Doubt
she's up for it.
He pushes through the velvet curtained door.
22.
A large gat man pushes past Joe.
At the end of the hall, Suzie leans in a doorway smoking a
cigarette. Not sexy, just tired. She sees Joe, and is about
to say no. But she sees Joe's eyes, and doesn't.
Exhaling a plume of smoke, she withdraws into her doorway.
Joe follows. Through her smoke.
Suzie naked at the mirror. She goes to Joe, lying on the
bed, distant.
JOE
I can't remember my mother's face.
I remember her touching my hair.
Like this.
He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles
briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in
his eyes.
JOE (CONT'D)
Do you want to go overseas?
SUZIE
Do I want to go overseas? With
you? Now?
JOE
Soon, maybe.
SUZIE
Baby that's sweet. You're a sweet
boy. You gotta be careful, it's
easy to think you know someone once
you been like this. What's in here
is services rendered.
JOE
Is that how it aughta be?
SUZIE
What, in nature?
(BEAT)
You know I get this a lot.
Especially young guys. I must have
wife eyes or something.
His face clouds.
23.
Joe gets home. Empty, quiet. Everything in place. He goes
to the rug, pulls it aside. Opens the safe.
All the gold, and nothing else. One bar juts from the side,
knocked out of place.
He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a
bright smear of fresh red blood.
Joe wakes with a start.
Joe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and
vanish in a puff of distant fire.
BEGIN MONTAGE:
1. Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers
celebrate.
2. Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man.
3. Joe in his floor safe, setting more gold bars.
4. Joe in the field, BANG.
5. Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair.
6. Joe in the field, BANG.
7. In the plant, a body sliding into the fire.
8. Joe in the field, BANG. BANG. BANG. His face more
determined with each shot.
26.
Joe walks silently towards his apartment door.
It is ajar. He hesitates. Knows he shouldn't.
Holding his breath, Joe edges in. It's ravaged, torn to
pieces. The floor safe is open, about half the gold bars
missing. But the apartment seems empty.
Exhaling, Joe works quickly. Knocks a tile aside, pulls a
wad of cash from the wall. A heavy jacket from the closet.
Eyes dart around the room - what else? But too late --
footsteps in the hallway. Joe ducks into the bathroom just
as Kid Blue and a TALL GAT MAN enter the apartment.
Joe crouches. Outside, Kid Blue piles the man's arms full of
gold bars.
KID BLUE (O.S.)
That's twenty four there. I'm
keeping count.
TALL GAT MAN (O.S.)
Uh huh.
KID BLUE (O.S.)
Two more trips should do it.
Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches.
28.
The Tall Gat Man exits, Kid Blue stays crouched over the
floor safe hefting out bars, his back to the bathroom. In
the distance, a GUNSHOT. Kid Blue's head perks up.
CREAK! From the bathroom. Quick as lightning, the Kid draws
his gat and spins - but Joe is already upon him, full sprint.
SLAM! Joe tackles the Kid backwards. But while Joe uses his
momentum to leap over the OPEN FLOOR SAFE, the Kid tumbles
back into it, vanishing inside with a painful thud.
Joe scrambles to a stop, lifts the heavy safe trap door and
SLAMS it down - just as the Kid's hand grasps the open edge.
With a sickening CRACK, the trap door closes on the Kid's
fingers.
A bellowing howl, his fingers withdraw, and the safe door
clicks shut. The ELECTRIC BOX rigged to the code pad to
crack it clatters off, and whirrrr, CLICK. Locked. Joe,
panting, goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts
clear and earnest:
JOE
Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell
Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell
him keep my bars safe cause I swear
to god I'm going to fix this, I'm
going to find my loop and I'm gonna
kill him. Tell Abe-
CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door
splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right
ear explodes.
More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls
back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now
footsteps running down the hall.
Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across
the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway,
shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding
as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.
The other LOOPERS buy Joe drinks and cheer him, celebrating.
His belongings in boxes. Joe unloads the GOLD BARS from the
trap door.
Joe smoking in window of an empty apartment, half unpacked.
Joe picks up a bottle of beer.
Several FRENCH GANGSTERS in suits shake down the OWNER of the
shop for money from the register. One holds a gun in the
owner's face.
Joe ignores them, walks out.
30.
Loud and dark. Joe shotguns eye drops right out in the open,
dances like a madman.
Joe's apartment, unpacked and lived in. Joe smokes.
In a NOOK behind a wall panel - stacks of CASH.
Joe takes money from the stacks in the nook, which have grown
drastically low.
LATER - sets a hypo down in the ashtray.
A GUN in the face of the shop's OWNER. Held by Joe. Several
years older now, in his mid thirties.
Dressed in a suit, surrounded by fellow GANGSTERS. Now part
of their gang.
A dingy dark hallway. Distant thumping bass indicates it's
maybe behind a club.
The hall is lined with French Gangster, all similarly
dressed. Reminiscent of the Gat Men. It takes us a moment
to recognize Joe among them.
In his EARLY 40s now. His face a hard weathered mask. A
soldier. (Note - it is here we transition from the actor
playing Young Joe to the one playing Old Joe.)
31.
Old Joe high as a kite, in an all out brawl. Punched to the
ground. Laughing his ass off.
A bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
Old Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his WIFE for the
first time. Long red hair (reminiscent of but NOT Suzie.) In
a green dress. She flees the fighting, towards the exit.
SORTIE.
Transfixed and high, Old Joe follows her. Puts his hand on
her shoulder. She turns, looks him over. Flips him off.
Leaves. Old Joe watches her go. In love.
Old Joe hits on his future Wife, she tells him to fuck off.
Old Joe in bed with his future Wife. They kiss.
Old Joe's future wife yells at him, holding his gun holsters
accusingly. She throws them across the room.
LATER - He holds her in bed, both of them troubled.
Old Joe driving. Deep in thought. His future Wife beside
him, her hand on his. He hits the brakes.
Old Joe sweats and shudders out his drug addiction. His Wife
tends to him.
The Wife cuts vegetables. Headlines (in French) scroll
across a small floating screen, against images of
destruction. Gangland Terror Spreads, Who is The Rainmaker
She turns it off.
Lazy, dust motes hanging in the sunlight through the windows.
Old Joe in bed, in his late 50s.
His Wife walks through, says something inconsequential, puts
her hand on his foot. Draws it away, fingers sliding off
gently. And is gone.
We stay with Old Joe. His deep breath. The sun warming the
sheets. Running water from the kitchen.
His eyes focus on his hand. Written in faded ink on the palm
is a number we do not recognize: 07153902935.
A long moment.
With all the violence in the world, the cottage's green front
door is KICKED OPEN.
Joe runs out of the bedroom half dressed, and GANGSTERS grab
him, taking him down with a rifle butt to the head.
His Wife is dragged from the kitchen screaming.
Concrete, nondescript. The Gangsters carry Joe in, now hog
tied. Put a sack over his head.
Lead him towards a machine, an iron monstrosity with a hatch.
One of the men taps his watch - hurry. Another man pulls a
large lever, and the machine hums, warming up.
Joe's face, covered with the sack. Breathing. Remembering:
flashes of his WIFE, screaming.
Then Joe LUNGES and somehow his hands are loose, he PUNCHES
one man, tears off the sack, PUNCHES another man, a flurry
and then it's over. He stands among a pile of broken men.
Slowly takes stock. Looks at the exit. Looks at the faded
number on his blood-smeared hand.
A million things in his mind. But just one choice. The
machine hums angrily. Ready.
Like an iron coffin. Old Joe climbs inside. Braces himself.
Closes the hatch behind him.
Flash and crack and he is sent.
Cramped. Old Joe walks in quickly, gets aspirin, wrapped
sandwiches, bandages, big bottles of water. Removes his torn
jacket, dumps it.
At the register, the CLERK bags everything up. Old Joe pulls
the blunderbuss on the clerk.
OLD JOE
And your jacket.
34.
The Gat Man Driver watches Old Joe disappear from view.
Suspicious, he uncovers a GAT on the seat beside him.
When he looks back up Old Joe stands in his headlights,
blunderbuss raised. BANG! The windshield shatters, the Gat
Man Driver is torn apart.
Old Joe runs up, flings open the door, digs through the
bloody mess frantically, finding the GAT.
35.
A swarm of activity, Gat Men rushing in and out.
36.
ABE (PRE-LAP)
He ain't dumb like the last, we
gotta get lucky now. Cover the
roads out of town. Sweep the
streets, pull in his social circle,
pound the pavement.
Map spread on a table. Gat men gathered around Abe.
GAT MAN 3
He'll hop a train. Fast and
untraceable.
ABE
Maybe. Sweep the train yard.
Every second that passes is bad,
go.
Kid Blue slumps in a chair, holding a rag to a wound on his
head. Eyes wet from crying. Abe storms in.
ABE
Stupid little shit.
KID BLUE
I can't hear you
Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts
ABE
Well that's what happens when you
fire a gat in a steel box you
stupid little shit.
KID BLUE
I can fix this. I can find him.
ABE
Go home and let the grown ups work.
Kid Blue.
A window shatters inward, punched through by a wrapped fist.
A big reading hall, empty and dark. The broken window opens,
Old Joe slides in. Weaves his way past the reading tables,
finds what he's looking for at a desk.
A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer.
Checking his hand, he inputs the number. Navigates menus and
windows, information flashing, searching.
Old Joe finishes printing several large documents that look
like maps. He folds them up, pockets them.
Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops.
On his hand, a smooth aged scar. Of an arrow. Pointing to
his wrist.
Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve,
revealing B then E
Then A then T... He bares his arm, reading the entire
message.
38.
The peephole screen on the inside of Seth's apartment door.
Kid Blue manipulating a device, a shower of sparks blows the
screen out momentarily, and the door swings open.
Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
apartment with over-eager purpose.
Empty. He deflates. Thinks.
Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up.
A little manipulating, and the image is rewinding.
An empty hall, scanning back half an hour. Then: young Joe.
Kid Blue stops scanning, hits PLAY'. Joe feels around the
door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment.
Kid Blue exhales. Well Joe was here.
Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's
about to step away when his eye catches something.
He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes. To a
live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment.
Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour.
On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a
little, then sits at the table. Head in his hands. Staring
into space.
Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something.
Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly
exits.
Kid Blue stops the screen.
He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared.
The kitchen counter. A blender, sink. Can labeled COFFEE.
Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open.
It's full of knives.
Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small
rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook.
Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces
together. Lights a cigarette.
The same from the previous flashback.
Old Joe in bed, half asleep. A woman's arm under his neck.
It slips away, and he kisses its wrist. Comfort, warmth.
The woman, leaving. Her hand touches and slides off his
foot, moving away.
Joe sits at a booth. Old Joe enters, steps up slowly, sits.
A moment of silence.
Along with his ear, Joe's hand and arm are now wrapped in
bloodied bandages. Joe's eyes go to Old Joe's arm. Old Joe
pulls his sleeve back and shows him the scar spelling
BEATRIX.
Beatrix the waitress steps up breezily.
BEATRIX
Coffee?
OLD JOE
Please. Black. And water.
BEATRIX
Anything else?
OLD JOE
(TO JOE)
Are we eating?
JOE
I ordered something.
OLD JOE
Steak and eggs, rare and scrambled.
BEATRIX
Two steak & eggs coming up.
40.
She goes. Another pause.
OLD JOE
We're not going to talk about time
travel.
JOE
...ok.
OLD JOE
Must hurt.
His arm.
JOE
Yeah. Didn't know if you'd
REMEMBER HER
OLD JOE
I put it together. Clever.
(BEAT)
Do I get the scar when you're cut,
or when the knife is on its way
down and it's inevitable that
you're going to be cut?
JOE
I'm not cutting myself again to-
OLD JOE
I'm not asking you to.
JOE
It's an interesting question, I've
just lost a lot of blood today.
OLD JOE
You know there's another girl here
on weekends.
JOE
(REALIZES)
Sue.
OLD JOE
Well. Have fun explaining who
Beatrix' is for the next thirty
years.
Beatrix sets Old Joe's black coffee next to Joe's white.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
How's the French coming?
JOE
Good.
41.
OLD JOE
(fast in French,
SUBTITLED)
I know you have a gun between your
legs.
Joe's face registers obvious incomprehension.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
No? Well you'll get there
eventually. Obviously.
JOE
I don't care what you're here for,
whatever you think you're going to
get from me. More time or whatever
you want. I can't let you walk
away from this diner alive.
Because the next 30 years of my
LIFE-
OLD JOE JOE
I'm sorry to cut off - sorry -are mine they're not yours
to cut off this spiel you've they're not yours anymore you
been practicing all night, can say anything you want but
but I need you to need you to you're not walking outta here
listen. Listen. alive
OLD JOE
You know what the voice of god
sounds like? See now good you're
confused now but you're listening.
I hope the voice of god sounds like
an old man speaking French. Old
men speaking French sound like
primeval trees in a strong wind,
just irrefutable. Wise, strong,
gentle, all these things in
harmony, complimentary. At once.
Old men speaking French. Young men
speaking French sound, without
exception, like weenies. Fact.
You ever hear a Frenchman under 40
try to sound threatening? It's
hilarious. English is a tight t-
shirt, flatters the young. Rat a
tat tat. French is a double
breasted suit. Young man can put
it on, but it always feels like
he's putting something on. Some
things, you just need the years.
It's my favorite language.
JOE
I've got a life ahead of me that's
mine and I'm not giving it up for
you or anybody
42.
OLD JOE
Well you know what you have to do
then why don't you take your little
gun out from between your knees and
do it. One in the head, two in the
heart. Boy. It's all anybody
and never and then you show up
here and think you can talk me into
dying. Well bullshit we both know
you're not going to kill me.
Christ you ordered eggs.
Old Joe downs two aspirin. Takes a breath.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
I know why you couldn't pull that
trigger. When you're tasked to do
the unthinkable, your mind, it'll
do anything it can to stop you.
Only way is you gotta know why
you're doing it, in your bones, so
you can say it out loud to someone
without apologizing. Or you gotta
cut yourself off, go numb. But
that'll kill you, down the line.
(BEAT)
It's hard to make eye contact with
you. It's too strange.
JOE
Your face looks backwards.
OLD JOE
Yeah, that helps actually. That
little twist of unfamiliar.
(BEAT)
You're not winning some pissing
contest by looking me in the eye,
you didn't know what I looked like
until yesterday, it makes sense
that it's easier for you.
JOE
I wasn't trying to. Do you know
what's going to happen? Have you
already done all this, right now,
as me?
OLD JOE
No not - exactly - I don't want to
talk about time travel shit,
because we'll start talking about
it and then we'll be here all day
making diagrams with straws. It
doesn't matter.
43.
JOE
When I hurt myself now, it changes
your body. Do my actions change
your memories?
OLD JOE
It doesn't matter because I don't
know how it works. Nobody knows
how it works. Time travel was an
accident, thirty years from now the
smartest men in the world know
exactly one thing about it that you
don't: they know to be scared to
death of it.
(BEAT)
My memory is cloudy, there's a
cloud. It's a, it starts clear
then gets cloudy as it goes back..
Goddammit hand me those.
Straws. Joe passes him two.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
And the salt. No, the pepper. The
pepper.
Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart, parallel, and
pours pepper between them, thus:
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
Ok, the span between the straws is
a timeline of the next 30 years.
THIS
(the left straw)
is the present moment, right now.
AND THIS
(the right straw)
is the moment thirty years from now
when I was sent back. The machine
is tuned to a fixed time, you know
that, 30 some years, it's not
adjustable.
JOE
What's the pepper?
44.
OLD JOE
The pepper is a sort of fog. See
my memories start clear here,
(at the right straw)
but as they go back they get
cloudier, until they're totally
obscured. It's like a fog.
Because my memories aren't really
memories, they're one possible
eventuality now, and they grow
clearer or cloudier as they become
more or less likely. But then they
get to the present moment
(the left straw)
And they're instantly clear again.
Like a wall of fog moving forward
with the present moment. I can
remember what you do after you do
it.
He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it
pushes the pepper with it.
JOE
So you can
OLD JOE
And it hurts.
JOE
So when we're apart you can
remember what I do. After I do it.
OLD JOE
Uh huh. But
Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates. Old Joe
awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
This is a precise description of a
fuzzy mechanism. Time travel fucks
everything, my brain and body try
to catch up. It's messy. That's
why it's dangerous. And it hurts.
All I know I know two things for
sure. I know what's happening in my
head. And I know that you're still
going to meet her.
JOE
Who?
Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his
pocket, clicks it open. We don't see inside it, but he
stares at it intently.
45.
JOE (CONT'D)
This is a woman, what? I'm going to
fall in love with?
OLD JOE
She's gonna save your life.
Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time,
and holds it. Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest
sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it,
he breaks off his gaze.
The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he
turns it into anger.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
For a long time at the beginning
she thought we'd have a baby. She
would have been a good mother. She
wanted that so much. And now I'm
saying sorry to a picture.
JOE
She's. How is she, you said save
my life.
OLD JOE
Your life. Let's look. At your
life. You're a killer and a
junkie. And a fucking child
mentality, My life, what's
mine. Save your life, you're
asking how? The question is why.
Why would someone waste themselves
on you, give up the good life they
had, sacrifice a good life to love
you.
JOE
My life is my own, I don't need it
SAVED
OLD JOE
Shut your fucking child mouth.
She's going to clean you up and
you're going to take her love like
a sponge and you're both going to
pretend that she's saved you,
you're so self absorbed and stupid.
(BEAT)
Yesterday. Thirty years from now
is yesterday. And I can remember
it, it's going to happen. Let me
tell you what's going to happen to
this woman who saved your worthless
life.
A GREEN DOOR - Kicked in with all the violence in the world.
46.
His Wife spins, as Gangsters burst into the entryway.
Old Joe in bed. It plays out again. He leaps to his feet,
is tackled by the Gangsters. They drag Old Joe from the
bedroom. Though the hall, Joe sees the woman struggling
against two Gangsters, her dress torn and bloody. One
approaches her with the knife.
Old Joe screams, struggles, but cannot stop them from doing
what they do to her.
Joe is not sure where to put his eyes.
OLD JOE
Have you heard of the Rainmaker?
JOE
Seth said, that night. A new boss
in the future, he said.
OLD JOE
The Rainmaker came out of nowhere
and in the span of six months took
total control of the five major
syndicates.
JOE
That would take an army.
OLD JOE
But he didn't have an army. Legend
is he did it alone. Alone alone.
Don't know I believe the legend but
he didn't have an army.
JOE
How did he do it?
OLD JOE
That's the question. And no one
knows. Not only that, there's no
pictures of him. It's insane.
There's stories he has a synthetic
jaw. Things like that. But word
spread quick about him through the
ex-looper grapevine, even before
his mass executions and vagrant
purges and reign of terror, because
the first thing he did was start
closing loops. All of them.
Exterminating the whole program.
Cleaning house.
47.
Old Joe pulls the folded papers he printed at the library out
of his jacket, puts them on the table.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
Do you know what this is? This
number. This number.
On the back of his papers he scrawls the number: 07153902935.
As he writes it, a phone starts ringing, bringing us into:
An 8th story office, under siege. Gangsters down in the
street fire up at the windows with guns. Helicopters pass
by. The office door is blocked shut with a filing cabinet.
On the phone - the looper DALE, but in his mid 50s. Battered
and terrified. Holding a piece of paper, reading off it, on
the phone with Old Joe.
The wall with the door in it EXPLODES inward.
The line goes dead. Old Joe hangs up. Looks at his hand,
with the number. Standing in his cottage, before he was sent
back. Through the window, his wife working in the garden.
Old Joe closes his hand.
OLD JOE (V.O.)
This is a piece of identifying
information on the Rainmaker. I
can use it to find him, now, and
stop him from killing my wife.
Old Joe showing the number to Joe.
JOE
None of this concerns me. We're
done we're gonna walk outside now.
OLD JOE
This is going to happen
JOE
It happened to you, it doesn't have
to happen to me.
(points: the pocket watch)
You got her picture in there? Show
it to me. Show me her picture.
And when I see her for the first
time I'll walk away, and she won't
be with me.
(MORE)
48.
JOE (CONT'D)
I guarantee the instant I look at
her picture that fog in your brain
will swallow up the memories of her
and she'll be gone.
OLD JOE
Gone.
JOE
She'll be safe. And then we can
all do what we have to do.
A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it.
Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back.
OLD JOE
No you don't understand. We don't
have to give her up. I'm going to
tell you why I'm here now.
He puts his hand on the folded papers.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
I'm gonna save her.
A quick beat. Joe goes for his gun. But Old Joe is fast, he
jams his foot into Joe's crotch, crushing the hidden gun into
him. Joe cries out, Old Joe grabs his hair and plants his
face into the table.
When Joe's hands go to his face Old Joe grabs them and pulls.
Foot in his crotch, pulling his arms tight over the table.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
The Rainmaker is alive right now.
Living here, somewhere in this
county. And I can find him with
this. I need you to lay low, stay
out of my way and not get caught.
I know how to fix this, I won't
stop till I finish it. I'm going
to find him and kill him.
Joe's face loosens, his eyes on their coffee cups.
JOE
It's been awhile since we've gotten
a warm-up.
Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet.
Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left. Fled.
Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the
hair, dragging him like a doll. Joe's blunderbuss clatters
to the ground. Old Joe drags him to the window. They look
out. Nothing in the parking lot. Too quiet.
49.
OLD JOE
It's been thirty years for me, so
it's hard to remember. When you
stole Seth's bike you stripped out
the security tracker. Right?
Joe's fearful face says no.' Old Joe draws his gat.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
Make it to the field, you can lose
them in the field. Go east and hop
A TRAIN
Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His
papers and gun fall. The diner door EXPLODES.
JOE
I've got him! He's here!
A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old
Joe gets the gat.
With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there
are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe
returns fire, glass breaking and chaos.
Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks.
Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet.
Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the
booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have
their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath
the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe.
OLD JOE
Shit.
Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind
Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the
broken window, jumps...
Sara makes coffee.
Blinds drawn, dark. A FIGURE lies in bed. Sara steps in,
puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot.
SARA
C'mon baby. Time to get up.
Cooking eggs. The front door bangs. She looks up.
The screen door bangs in the wind. Sara inspects it. The
latch is broken. She sighs.
Then freezes.
52.
Through the screen door, some fifty yards across the front
lawn, the dark figure of a MAN stands at the edge of the corn
fields. Watching her.
She watches right back for a long moment.
Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no
hesitation at all plows outside.
The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields.
Abe stands fuming, flanked by two Gat Men. Kid Blue sits
like a kid in detention.
ABE
Well. You found him. And you
russeled up a posse and went to git
em. Like a good little cowboy
from one of your movie movies.
Without telling me.
KID BLUE
I can do it again.
ABE
You can fuck up again? Really.
You know what happens to me if I
don't get that old bastard? I got
too much riding, Kid, I can't
afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.
Put your gat on the table.
Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he
doesn't take his hand off it.
KID BLUE
I wanted you to say I did good,
that's all I wanted. This is all I
have.
Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the
trigger. A tense moment. Abe pulls the gun away, across the
table.
KID BLUE (CONT'D)
Please just give me one more
chance, I'll bring him here alive
and hold him and you can put a
bullet in his brain yourself-
Abe grabs the hammer. SLAMS it on Kid's bad hand, crushing
it. Kid howls, the Gat Men grab him.
Kid is literally dragged up the stairs by a Gat Man.
The Gat Man shoves Kid Blue through the twisty maze of
backstage, past girls and Loopers and men.
54.
The Kid blubbers and bleeds. Humiliated. But he pulls
himself halfway together. Make a show:
KID BLUE
I'm gonna make this good again. I
will. I'm gonna be back.
From a CHILD'S POV - We run across a darkened bedroom to the
WINDOW. A child's hand smacks the glass, and framed through
the pane, through the unseen child's eyes, this is what we
SEE:
Sara on the ground, fumbling the gun. In trouble. The DARK
MAN, advancing towards her menacingly.
At the last moment, from the corn fields, JOE runs into the
light and steps directly between them, shouts, his gun raised
at the Dark Man.
And the Dark Man STOPS.
Sara tries to pick Cid up but he dodges, walks up the stairs.
CID
Who's that man?
SARA
Just a vagrant babe.
Sara leads him down the hall and into his bedroom.
CID
No he's not.
SARA
Oh yeah?
CID
His shoes are too shiny.
SARA
Well aren't you a smart monkey.
He gets in bed.
CID
Is he sick?
SARA
Yup.
59.
CID
Will he get better?
SARA
Yup.
CID
Promise?
SARA
Go to sleep. Okay. Night baby
boy.
Kisses him.
CID
Night Sara.
Lingers over him in the pale light. Then goes.
Sara gets in, drops Cid's cup on the seat beside her. Looks
in her rear view mirror. Leaving a man to die. Looks down
at Cid's cup. For a long moment.
SARA
Ssssshhit.
Sara lights a gas lamp. Threads a hose from a tank of water
around the cot. Joe on a metal cot, covered with blankets.
SARA
Water. Drink it, all night, more
than you think you want.
Moves a metal bucket next to the bed. Adjusts the blankets.
SARA (CONT'D)
Aim for the bucket. And don't chew
your tongue off. In the morning
we're gonna talk.
60.
The last thing she does is handcuff his wrist to the cot and
take his gun. On her way out she puts it on a bench beside
the door, and turns out the floodlight.
Underground. We move through it.
Cavernous space beneath a high street grating, damp and cold.
Old Joe sits on the ground, methodically cleaning and loading
his gun. He finishes. Places the gun on top of his folded,
torn maps. Closes his eyes. Sees:
Old Joe touches his temple. Head aching. Remembering.
OLD JOE
The first time I saw her face.
OLD JOE
No. No no.
His POCKET WATCH sits open in front of him. He picks it up.
Old Joe holds his pocket watch tight like a talisman.
Fingers dug deep in his head.
OLD JOE
No. The first time I saw her face.
A fist comes straight at us. SMACK!
We reel back, revealing: the Paris club, crowded and rowdy.
A piece of Old Joe's life that we've seen before.
Joe (mid 40s) lies on the ground, lip bloodied, laughing
hysterically at a YOUNG PUNK who has just hit him. A bar
fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his Wife for the
first time. In her green dress. Whisps of fog drift into
frame.
Inside Old Joe's pocket watch, a picture. Of his WIFE.
The sun breaks in through the grate above. Old Joe closes
the pocket watch, holds in tight. Then he stands and picks
up the gun and goes.
CUT TO:
A child stands in a massive doorway with blinding white light
beaming through.
JOE'S FACE - wrecked, but his eyes flutter. Blink.
Joe lies on the cot. Blinks. The barn doors, the morning
sun rising through. If the child was there, he's gone now.
Cid draws at the kitchen table. Sara enters.
SARA
Morning monkey.
CID
The man's up.
Sara stiffens, looks out the window.
CID (CONT'D)
Is he staying here now?
62.
SARA
No.
A WALL OF LEAVES
Fingers part the green, and Old Joe peers through the dense
foliage.
Sara drags Joe in by the foot. She heaves the barn door
closed. In the lamp lit dark Joe rolls and groans in the
dirt.
SARA
Who are you?
She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury
SARA (CONT'D)
You're right I'm not a killer but I
am fine with how a blast of rock
salt to your face won't kill you.
Who are you and what are you here
for? Who are you?
Joe breathes hard, bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his
nose. But he forces calm. A beat. Then he starts talking.
JOE
Time travel hasn't been invented
yet. But in thirty years it will
be.
Sara sits. Joe weakly talks, the end of a long explanation.
JOE
I can't go back to the city and
find him cause Abe, the boss, all
his men are going to search the
streets 24/7 till they turn up me
or... him. All I have is this map.
And that he's coming here.
Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought.
SARA
A Looper.
JOE
Yeah. Did you know about Loopers,
what we do
SARA
I've heard stories. So he's coming
here to murder me and my son
because he thinks we might be this
Rainmaker. And once he kills the
Rainmaker, what happens?
JOE
I think... he thinks, the instant
the rainmaker dies, he'll never
have been sent back, so he'll just
vanish, and be back with his wife.
67.
SARA
Who is he? The guy you let run?
Just some random guy from the
future?
JOE
Yeah. Someone. You know what
these numbers mean.
Sara takes a pen from a workbench. Shows Joe the numbers:
07153902935
She draws lines with the pen, thus:
07/15/39[02935]
SARA
This is my son Cid's birthday. And
this is the hospital he was born
in.
Joe's face, taking this in.
The Wife stands at the edge of a bed. 35 and Full of life.
Old Joe on the bed. Mid 40s.
She unsnaps her GREEN DRESS and it falls, leaving her naked
in the sunlight.
LATER
On the bed. Old Joe and the Wife. Faces close. Drifting
into sleep. From a neighboring apartment, a BABY CRIES.
Loud and insistent.
Old Joe opens his eyes, joking-annoyed at the crying baby.
God you have to be kidding me.
Then he sees her face. Her smiling eyes, listening to the
neighbor's baby cry. Like she's listening to music. She
touches his hand.
Sara holds the torn piece of map in her hands. Their house
circled.
SARA
Would he do this?
JOE
Think about what doing this would
fix. What he thinks it would fix.
Sara caught that, and she did not like it.
69.
JOE (CONT'D)
He'll kill the other kids on that
map and then come here last. Put
off facing me.
SARA
If he comes here, can you stop him?
She turns the paper over in her hands.
SARA (CONT'D)
Given this, if I erred on the side
of caution and believed all of
this, I'm asking. If I trusted
you. Will you stop him before he
gets to my son?
JOE
I've lost my life. I kill this
man, I get it back. You can trust
me.
Sara leads Cid back into the house.
SARA
How's the maths coming?
71.
CID
I wanna help the man.
SARA
Help him what?
CID
I could help him with my toys.
SARA
Baby. Listen. I need you to stay
away from that man. Okay? Let him-
HEY
Cid squirms out of her grasp, bats her away with a light but
angry slap. She grabs his arm harder.
SARA (CONT'D)
Let him do his thing, but you stay
with me.
CID
Is he not good?
SARA
Well we're gonna see what he is.
But you stick with me. Yeah?
Old Joe's little hide-out. He violently washes his hands in
a trench of water.
Slumps back, eyes blood red. Streaks of tears down his face.
Reddish light fading to blue through the grating high above.
Runs fingers across his forehead, spreading cooling water.
His eyes close. His breathing shallows.
In one hand he holds his pocket watch. He places the other
on the gat. The map beneath it.
Daniel's map location CROSSED OUT. Two others remaining.
And the missing corner, edge torn.
CLOSE ON Old Joe's face. Slipping to sleep.
Then from nowhere a CHILD'S HAND enters frame and rests on
his forehead. Old Joe's eyes gasp open with terror
Cid leads Joe inside, beckoning him to follow.
Dark. Cid leads Joe to the kitchen table. Laid out on it:
an arrangement of toys.
With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a
flashlight and sets it on the table.
Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out
wires. Hands moving fast. Joe sits, watching Cid.
CID
Hand me that Phillips.
Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working.
CID (CONT'D)
Tell me if you hear her coming.
JOE
What are we doing here?
CID
Commundication.
He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and
an identical one next to Joe lights up.
The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly.
CID (CONT'D)
But I need to make it stronger.
JOE
How do you do that?
CID
Bigger battery.
Joe idly fingers a toy.
JOE
Smart.
CID
Do you kill people?
Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows.
AFTER AWHILE:
JOE
Let's say I kill people.
73.
CID
With your gun?
JOE
Uh huh.
Cid looks at him in the dark. Not scared at all. Then he
goes back to fitting the backing on a toy.
A long beat, Joe thinking.
Broken by a PIERCING NOISE.
They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is
shrieking, sirens blaring.
Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off,
they both freeze.
And look up at the ceiling.
Silence in the house.
With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck
from Joe and finishes up his work.
JOE (CONT'D)
How long have you and your mom been
on the farm?
CID
She's not my mom. My mom got
killed when I was a baby. Someone
bad, bad men killed her.
Cid sets the two finished BUZZERS on the table.
JOE
I'm sorry.
CID
Sara doesn't think I remember cause
I was a baby. But I remember my
mom. I couldn't stop her getting
killed. I don't remember it all
but I remember. I was a baby. I
couldn't do anything. I couldn't
stop it. Cause I was a baby.
Cid is crying. Joe has never been more at a loss.
JOE
I'm sorry
Takes the buzzers. Stands, fumbling. Retreating.
74.
JOE (CONT'D)
You should talk to your mom about
this.
CID
She's not my mom. She's a liar.
With one last look back at Cid in the dark, Joe exits.
SMASH CUT TO:
A Gat Man briefing Abe, who hasn't gotten much sleep lately.
GAT MAN 1
-spotted him coming out of a sewer
tunnel on the west end, he's on the
RUN
ABE
Every fucking car, every gat, every
cop - get em down there! Flood
that fucker! Take him down!
Kid Blue, squatting in the 10th story of a half finished
highrise, looks down on the activity in the streets.
Spread on the floor are maps with notes. He's been searching
for Old Joe.
And now his eyes are alight. He bolts for the stairs.
Sara vacuums while Cid plays with toy trucks.
In the basement, bare concrete. Sara empties the dryer.
Sara sits on the floor with Cid, putting numbered tiles on a
plastic multiplication table.
SARA
Where does 56 go? Good. 21.
CID
How long can you not sleep?
SARA
I don't know, awhile. That's a
good question. Where's it go.
Good, there. 32.
CID
We should help Joe watch.
SARA
Joe?
CID
Cause he can't stay awake all the
time.
SARA
He isn't our business.
79.
CID
He's keeping us safe
SARA
Baby. Let's do this now. You have
32 there, I know you know this one.
CID
I want to help him.
Sara is distracted by a distant bell-like DINGING.
SARA
Cid. 32.
She goes to the window, looks out, nervous.
But it's just a loose LAUNDRY LINE down in the yard, whipping
in the wind against its metal pole. In the distance, Joe
paces the yard.
Relieved, Sara returns to Cid. He sets the tile, petulant.
SARA (CONT'D)
No. Eight times three is what?
CID
Thirty two.
SARA
Eight times three is what?
CID
Thirty two.
SARA
I want you to count three eights.
CID
Eight. Sixteen. Thirty two.
SARA
Are you telling me you want alone
time?
CID
No.
SARA
Okay. Why don't you put that where
it belongs?
Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back
down on the same spot.
SARA (CONT'D)
Alone time.
80.
Then like a knife in a fist fight:
CID
He's protecting us cause you can't
do it.
SARA
Ok. I told you to stay away from
HIM
CID
I never did anything
SARA
Do you think I'm stupid?
CID
So?
SARA
I told you already
Cid is building into a temper tantrum fast.
CID
So?
SARA
You do what I tell you
CID
You can't tell me what to do you're
not my mom.
(a deadly beat)
You're not my mom! You're a liar
and you're gonna get killed and you
won't stop lying!
Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back.
Not hard, but Cid scoots back, eyes furious.
SARA
CID BABY
CID
You're a liar! Liar! I hate you
because you're lying! I hate you!
Liar! You're lying to me!
Sara scoots back.
SARA
CID
CID
You're lying!
81.
Cid stands, balls his fists, SCREAMING at her. Sara pushes
back away from him.
Maybe a cloud passed over the sun. The room darkens.
And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid. She bolts
out of the room.
Not slowing, through her bedroom
Into her walk-in closet, to a huge steel safe tucked in back.
She opens the safe with trembling hands. And climbs inside.
Closes the heavy door. Turns on a small LED light.
And waits. Cid's screams distant but not lessening.
The math game scattered, numbered tiles everywhere. Cid lies
face down on the bed, cried out.
Sara enters quietly. Sits on the bed beside him. Strokes
his hair. He folds into her, and they're holding each other
tight.
Canady starts the car up, starts driving.
82.
Somehow not seeing Kid Blue crouched clear as day in the
passenger side foot-well.
KID BLUE
Hey Can. Can.
Canady sees him, jumps and yelps.
The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car.
Coffee everywhere.
CANADY
Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the
FUCK
KID BLUE
Pull into that alley.
CANADY
You get the fuck outta
KID BLUE
You don't wanna be seen with me
Canady, pull in the alley.
Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley,
parks it.
CANADY
The fuck are you still doing in
town, Abe wants you dead man
KID BLUE
All Abe wants right now is the
looper. Unless he got him last
night?
CANADY
Jssshhh. No we didn't get him.
Spotted and lost him. West End,
near Whore's Alley.
KID BLUE
Whore's Alley?
CANADY
That area, Mott & Talbott, little
working girl colony.
KID BLUE
(has a thought)
Whore's Alley..
CANADY
You shoulda left town man.
83.
KID BLUE
I'm gonna bring him in, get right
with Abe.
CANADY
Yeah, maybe you bring him the
looper, but short of that Abe don't
get right with priced men.
KID BLUE
I got a price?
CANADY
Big one.
Canady locks the car doors.
And in that one moment, Kid Blue pulls Canady's gun from his
holster. Holds it on him. A tense moment.
CANADY (CONT'D)
Course I'd never turn a friend for
A PRICE
Sara lies with Cid, both asleep.
Distant but sharp, a bell ringing. It's unmistakable this
time. The DINNER BELL. Sara's eyelids flutter. She hears.
Stiffens.
The bell stops suddenly. She stands, careful not to wake
Cid.
Sara rushes quietly down the stairs.
Through a doorway, she sees the Frog Buzzer sitting on the
living room coffee table. Lit up and buzzing.
She goes to the front door, throws it open. And is face to
face with a tall Gat Man named JESSE. She freezes.
JESSE
Evenin ma'am.
SARA
Evenin. How can I help you?
84.
Joe is nowhere in sight.
JESSE
You can start by accepting my
apologies re the hour, I hope I
didn't catch you in supper.
SARA
No, that's fine.
JESSE
Yours was the last house on my list
today, been walking between empty
farms all day in the hot sun.
Thought I'd tick this off my list,
not have to come back tomorrow.
SARA
What's this about?
Back in the house somewhere, a screen door bangs.
JESSE
You alone here, ma'am?
SARA
My husband should be back from the
city, any time now.
JESSE
Happy to hear. Could I trouble you
for some water?
SARA
Course. I'll get some, you can
take the glass with you.
JESSE
Actually ma'am, my business
tonight, this ticking off the list
business, it's gonna require me
coming in. If that's alright.
Jesse shifts his weight, and Sara notices his heavy boot is
now a few inches over the door jam.
SARA
Will you tell me what this is
about?
JESSE
I will, yes. Can I come in?
Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun.
Possibilities whirling through her mind.
85.
JESSE (CONT'D)
Ma'am?
Silent decision, and she steps aside to let him enter.
Joe slips in through the screen door, gun in hand. Freezes
in the kitchen, listening.
JESSE (O.S.)
I'm a deputized police officer,
we're looking for an escaped
criminal, just doing a sweep. Seen
anyone through here the past two
days, vagrants?
SARA (O.S.)
No, vagrants are always passing but
nobody near the house.
Footsteps, as they walk deeper in the house. Joe can't tell
if they're coming through the living room or hall. He
hesitates.
JESSE (O.S.)
This man, here.
SARA (O.S.)
He's young. No.
Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as
they enter from the living room.
Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe. She pours
him some water. Jesse hands her a second photograph.
JESSE
We're looking for his father too,
similar look and build but late
50s. May or may not be travelling
together.
This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega,
of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk.
Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with
Joe's. Mind spinning. Maybe making the connection, we're
not sure.
SARA
No.
She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take
them. He notices the toys on the table.
86.
JESSE
Keep em. Kids with your husband?
SARA
Yeah. Just one.
JESSE
How old?
SARA
Eight.
Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe
slipping through the hall and into the living room.
He lifts his glass, drinks.
JESSE
Thank you.
SARA
I'll show you round the grounds,
then the house, then you can be on
your way.
Sara holds the screen door open for him.
JESSE
We'll start with the house.
Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him.
He sits on a couch, taps on a small folding phone. Sara
follows him.
JESSE
Eight, you said? Boy? And your
husband. Just gotta, check in.
With the home office. This goddamn
thing.
SARA
This man dangerous?
JESSE
Tween you me and a lamppost? No.
Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My
boss has half the city's looking
for him. Half the city and me.
So. And if you find him, there's a
helluva price. Think on that if he
comes by, acting sweet.
Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees
Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs.
87.
If Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day.
Joe motions for Cid to get out. Cid points to Jesse, makes a
GUN with his hand. Asking Joe.
Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out! Cid silently
creeps down the stairs.
He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't
look up from his phone.
Cid vanishes down the hall. Jesse looks up, stands.
JESSE (CONT'D)
Alright, show me upstairs.
The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs. Jesse looks
sharply at Sara.
SARA
Drafts, in the house.
Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant
Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway.
Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe.
JESSE (O.S.)
This door doesn't latch?
SARA (O.S.)
It used to, it's busted.
Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in.
Cid follows him in, down steep concrete stairs. Pulls the
door closed behind them. It CREAKS. Jesse steps out into
the hallway, gun drawn. Sara behind him.
JESSE
Drafty house.
SARA
Farm house.
Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it.
CREAK. He looks at Sara.
JESSE
What's down there?
SARA
Laundry room. Door must've blown
open.
88.
Jesse opens the door, then looks at Sara gravely.
JESSE
Two things. First, I have a family
of my own back in the city, and I
want to see them again. Second if
anything happens to me, and I don't
report back to my boss people in
fifteen minutes, they're gonna know
I disappeared searching this house,
and inside of another fifteen
you'll have an army of more me's
kicking down your door. Ok?
SARA
It's a laundry room.
Jesse motions - her first.
Bare concrete basement, starkly lit by a hanging bulb. The
only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer, and
a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge.
No windows. Nowhere else to go. Jesse levels his gun at the
hamper.
JESSE
You want to call out whoever's
hiding in that hamper?
SARA
If someone was hiding in the house,
that's what I'd do. But nobody is
in the house. Open it up.
JESSE
No I think I'm gonna put a shot
through it just to be safe.
He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly.
JESSE (CONT'D)
You wanna call him out?
Sara stays silent. A long beat.
Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty.
She throws open the washer and dryer. She takes the bucket
and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's
empty.
89.
SARA
Now if you promise not to wag your
gun at my shoe rack I'll show you
upstairs then show you the fuck
out.
She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his
gun and follows her.
The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the
room, and into a drain hole under the hamper.
Dark and earthy. Cid leads Joe with his flashlight.
A deep large hole capped with a wooden trap door. Joe
squats, Cid stands.
CID
My granddad built it, but he didn't
tell anyone of us why. Nanna said
cuz he was nuts.
JOE
Thank you granddad.
CID
That wasn't the man.
JOE
No. I know him, that's what's
funny. His name's Jesse. I like
him. He'll go away when he doesn't
find me, he won't hurt her.
They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse
leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking
back towards the highway.
JOE (CONT'D)
My mom gave me up. I was younger
than you. We were vagrants, and
she was alone, for a long time I
thought she was stupid for getting
on the drug she was on, it was bad
stuff, it probably ended up killing
her.
(MORE)
90.
JOE (CONT'D)
But now I see, she was so alone.
And it was what she had. She sold
me. To a panhandle gang.
QUICKLY, SILENTLY WE SEE - FOUR YEAR OLD JOE dragged into
darkness by rough men, screaming. Then we're back to the
scene.
JOE (CONT'D)
But I got away. And I ran and I
ended on a train, sitting in the
dark in an empty freight, going to
the city, and I saw myself over and
over killing those men who bought
me and who got my mom on what she
was on. Finding them and tearing
them apart. Saving my mom.
CID
But you didn't.
JOE
A man in the city found me, put a
gun in my hand, and gave me some
things. I didn't have my mom
anymore. I had my work, my money.
My plans. For my life. That's
what I'd kill for. Not something I
don't have, and can't ever get
back.
(BEAT)
There's just men figuring out what
they'd do to keep what's theirs,
what they got. That's the only
kind of man there is.
CID
I'm not gonna let Sara get killed.
Joe looks at him. Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but
doesn't.
JOE
I think we're clear.
He opens the trap door, climbs out.
A tiny, dark concrete room. Kid Blue watches a screen, his
hand on a toggle wheel. A security cam view of Suzie's
apartment building upper landing. Playback of last night.
It scans quickly forward.
The APARTMENT SUPER leans against the wall behind him,
counting money.
KID BLUE
All working girls, yeah?
SUPER
Uh huh. This whole block. You
wanna check those too, I can
arrange.
KID BLUE
I do.
On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from
next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an
instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the
playback.
KID BLUE (CONT'D)
Lo Joe.
Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches
Suzie through the window for a long while. Kid watches him
intently.
Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves.
Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket.
SUPER
I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha.
But you don't see what you wanna
see, no refunds.
Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels.
Rain beats against stained glass. Old Joe kneeling in a pew.
Fists clenched as if in prayer. He stands, stumbles out.
Old Joe staggering to his feet from a fight.
We've seen this before, it's the IDENTICAL SCENE to the
previous flashback.
But when he sees his Wife for the first time, whisps of FOG
grow, blotting out the scene. Deep in the fog are other
backgrounds - a street, a house - and unfamiliar faces.
Other eventualities, clouding this one as it becomes less
likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory.
Erasing it.
OLD JOE'S EYES.
Old Joe in bed with his wife. Baby crying outside. Her
face. Then, whisps of FOG thickens, obscuring them.
OLD JOE'S EYES.
Sara lies in bed. Eyes wide open. Still and quiet in the
dark. Her hand moves over her bare leg. Slides across the
sheets. Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her.
A moment of hesitation. Then she pushes it.
Silence. Her eyes go to the window. A long beat. Then
sound: a door opening in the house below.
94.
Quick footsteps approaching. Her eyes follow them. The door
flies open. Joe, gun in hand, buzzer in the other. His eyes
adjust to the dark.
JOE
What?
Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head
doesn't know where to go.
SARA
Don't wake Cid.
She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain
starts to fall against the windows.
LATER
Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned.
Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She
sets the lighter on her palm. It floats about a foot in the
air, spinning, then drops.
JOE
That's pretty good.
SARA
In the city, young guys would hit
on me by floating fucking quarters,
I wouldn't tell em I was TK but
I'd keep their quarters down. One
guy busted a blood vessel in his
eye trying to get it up.
(BEAT)
He's you. Your loop. You lied to
me.
She doesn't seem angry but deeply curious. Joe sits up.
SARA (CONT'D)
But you protected Cid. And I know
you're not lying that you're gonna
kill this guy, your own self. Even
though he's protecting your future.
JOE
He's protecting his future. Not
mine.
A beat.
SARA
When I came back, after my sister
died. Cid was sitting on the
porch, I remember seeing him for
the first time, in two years.
(MORE)
95.
SARA (CONT'D)
Saw him on the porch. I drove up
crying and I had been at a party in
the city when I got the call, I was
wearing this ridiculous party
dress. All my ridiculous shit. I
don't know if he remembered me, but
he looked at me. I abandoned him.
I abandoned my baby.
(BEAT)
Maybe I can't be a mother to him,
is that something I can't get back.
When he looked at me then, on the
porch, he was mine again, he was my
son. I seen so many men in the
city, who I look in their eyes and
they're lost. Whether he loves me
back or not I'm gonna love my son I
said. And he's never gonna get
lost.
Joe sitting up still, Sara lying beside him, maybe crying.
He touches her hair.
A DOOR FRAME - kicked open with all the violence in the
world. Old Joe sweeps into the small apartment, gun drawn.
Suzie cooking in a robe, opens her mouth to scream.
OLD JOE
Don't. Don't wake up your
daughter.
Old Joe trains the gun on her. She goes silent.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
Sit down.
At the kitchen table. Quivering, she does. He keeps the gun
on her.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
Do you know me?
SUZIE
No. I don't know you. Who are
you?
OLD JOE
I need to tell you why I'm doing
this. I gotta say it out loud to
someone so I know.
SUZIE
Why you're doing what?
96.
Joe sleeping alone in the bed. Sara's voice, distant.
SARA (O.S.)
Joe. Joe.
He wakes. She is calling him from downstairs.
Joe comes down the stairs half dressed.
Jesse holds Sara at gunpoint in the living room. Staring at
Joe with a cool lack of malice.
JESSE
Lo' Joe.
JOE
Jesse.
OLD JOE
I threw my gun away once. To get
her love. And I was going to do it
again, now. Because I know she'd
want me to. I was going to do it.
And I saw then, I saw her
vanishing, like how life probably
goes when you die. That's what she
was asking me to give up this time.
SUZIE
...who are you?
OLD JOE
And if I picked up the gun. If I
made this sacrifice. Life, my
life. Absolution. Given back to
me. My love. Given back, just
like we were, and she wouldn't know
what I did to get it back.
Joe steps into the living room, stands facing them.
JOE
I'm unarmed Jesse, you can let her
go. Sara, Jesse here's the best
shot with a gat I've ever seen,
when he lets you go you sit on the
couch and don't do anything stupid.
Jesse lets Sara go and trains the gat on Joe.
97.
JOE (CONT'D)
He's coming here Jess. My Looper,
is gonna come here.
JESSE
I gotta take you in man.
JOE
I got eighty large in pure gold, I
take my looper back in and get
right with Abe, whatever he gives
me back I'll split it with you.
JESSE
Was that your plan?
JOE
Ok. It's yours, all of it
JESSE
Are you delusional?
OLD JOE
Everything set right. Everything
fixed. Through this sacrifice.
SUZIE
What are you gonna do?
Old Joe stands, walks towards the back hall. Suzie screams
SUZIE (CONT'D)
No!
And runs at him but he shoves her back hard.
JESSE
I know you got no options you take
the one you got but Joe, you aint
gettin right with no one. Looper
or no, you're beyond saving. As
long as Abe's got one Gat Man
standing, he'll be hunting you till
his dying day.
Joe's face falling.
Old Joe, gun ready, down the darkened hallway towards the
door at the end with a rainbow on it. He puts his hand on
the knob.
98.
JESSE
We're going now. We're gonna go to
my truck, you're gonna
CREAK. Cid on the stairs, sleepy eyed. Jesse, purely on
instinct, spins and draws on Cid.
Cid's POV - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel
leveled at him. Cid makes a strange shouting noise, falls
back.
Everything slows down.
Old Joe pushes the door open. Blackness within.
The room darkens. As if the sun passed behind a cloud.
Jesse realizes it's a kid. Lowers his gun. But Cid is mid-
scream, falling back, his foot misses the step and he tumbles
down the stairs.
Confused, terrified, falling. Joe runs into the foyer, to
catch Cid. Sara runs behind him.
The room is very dark now. Knick-knacks around the room
rattle, then LIFT INTO THE AIR. All of them. Floating.
Spinning. Sara's LIGHTER, on the coffee table: it RISES
into the air.
Old Joe readies his gun, staring into the blackness. But his
eyes lower. He touches his temple. Remembering.
Fog clears - Joe is almost to Cid, who is still tumbling,
nearly at the bottom of the stairs.
But just before he reaches him, Sara shoves Joe from behind.
Shoving him TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR. He's confused but her
face is set.
Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer, face contorted with
rage now, hand raised to Jesse, palm outstretched.
Screaming. His scream louder than it should be.
99.
Bigger things in the living room RISE OFF THE GROUND.
Chairs. The couch. And Jesse. He rises five feet in the
air, terrified.
Sara pulls Joe through the front door, and he looks back and
sees Jesse suspended in the air and Cid on the ground
screaming like an animal, and just as they cross the
threshold, Jesse explodes in a bright red fan of blood.
Old Joe's face. Remembering.
Frozen in a tableau - Cid screaming, raw power. Jesse
EXPLODING. A bright red fan.
Old Joe's eyes lift. Realizing.
OLD JOE
The Rainmaker.
A bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on.
A six year old girl's room. But the only person in it is Kid
Blue. He shoots Old Joe with a blue tazer.
Old Joe hits the ground, mouth foaming, paralyzed. Knowing
the answer now, knowing the who and the how but helpless and
defeated.
Kid Blue kicks him in the face.
CID
100.
A Gat Man circles a spot on the map in red ink, Sara's farm.
GAT MAN 1
He's there. Lost his signal five
minutes ago, right after he sent
word he had him. Joe.
Abe slumps in a chair, taking oxygen from a tank.
ABE
Call everyone, every Gat Man in the
city, call em here. Gather em all
up here first. No mistakes this
time. We're gonna take an army to
that farm, all at once, and sweep
it like hellfire. Now.
Joe emerges from the corn.
Cid crouches at one end of the small clearing. He looks at
Joe. Terrified. Half covered in blood. Hair matted over
one eye.
Joe looks back at him. Approaches him, gun not raised, but
in hand. Cid, like a frightened animal. A long moment.
And just like that, Joe puts his hand on Cid's head. Cid
leans against his legs, crying.
Sara bursts into the clearing, sees this. Runs to Cid and
embraces him, wiping the blood from his face. Joe steps back.
JOE
Right now two things have happened.
My looper knows Cid's the kid he's
looking for, and my gang knows I'm
here. So in fifteen minutes one or
both is coming down that highway.
You pack up the Gat Man's truck,
whatever you can fit in ten
minutes, and you drive North away
from the city.
SARA
Where are you going?
Joe takes the Frog Buzzer from his pocket, presses it.
Sara's buzzes in her pocket.
JOE
One buzz means come and get me.
Two or nothing, don't.
He vanishes into the stalks, towards the highway.
Crowded with Gat Men, all preparing.
GAT MAN 1
We got everyone here. All our men.
ABE
Arm em up, let's go.
103.
BUZZZZ. Abe turns, annoyed, and sees the security monitor.
On the screen - Kid Blue rips the sack off and holds Old
Joe's bloodied face up to the camera.
KID BLUE (ON SPEAKER)
I got him Abe. I got him.
ABE
Well. Shhhhhit.
The door buzzes open. Kid pushes Old Joe through the long
entrance hallway, past a dozen Gat Men, who watch him with
shocked amazement.
Old Joe's hands bound back. Kid Blue glows. He comes to the
tiny coat check room, and Big Craig stops him, then sees Old
Joe.
BIG CRAIG
Hoh. So both we got?
KID BLUE
Just the Looper. I got him. Knew
he went for whores, so I checked
every building.
BIG CRAIG
They found Joe too though, in a
farm on the east side. That's why
all the Gats are here, the whole
crew's arming up to make a sweep.
KID BLUE
Joe fuck Joe, save your bullets I
got the Looper. Not such a fuck up
huh? I'm taking him up to
This happens very fast:
Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back
into Kid Blue, SLAMMING him against the opposite wall.
Old Joe grabs (behind his back) Kid Blue's gun, and blasts
one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the
Kid's midsection.
He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in
the face. Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway
while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic
rifle.
He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but
mostly the men are trapped. Then it's over. All is smoky
still for a moment.
104.
Old Joe stares at the exit door ajar, down the long hallway
jammed with bodies. Then at the passage that leads deeper
into the club.
A Gat Man runs in, and Old Joe shoots him down.
He steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns
and grenades. Then launches himself into passageway towards
the club.
Old Joe weaves his way through the backstage area, chucking
grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle
into the smoky aftermath.
And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being
gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man.
The corridors are tight, twisty. Old Joe uses that.
Throwing grenades. Blasting away. Purging. Killing
everyone he lays eyes on. Wiping them out. All the bad guys.
It's horrible. Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way
people actually die from gunshots. Old Joe forges on, deeper.
Empty. Old Joe kicks the door open. Takes it in, the
office. Hammer on the desk. He reloads a gun. Eyes find
the door to Abe's inner den.
Abe and two Gat Men, guns out, crouched behind the table.
Watching the door. A display screen shows Old Joe on the
other side.
Abe, eyes dull. Shouts at the door
ABE
Joe. Guess I put the gun in that
kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess
everything comes back around. Like
your goddamn ties.
Old Joe. Breathing hard. Reloaded. Closes the gun.
Kid Blue's eyes flutter open. He lifts himself painfully.
Checks his chest. Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his
chest is grazed.
The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead.
Kid Blue wanders the smoky halls. Dead and dying men.
Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest. Kid Blue
stands over them. Stunned. Tears well in his eyes.
Then on the wall, he sees the map. The farm circled in red.
Cid sits in a darkened car, holding a bloody rag to his jaw.
Cid's face. Bloody. Dirty. His eyes full of hate. The
train rumbles towards the dark city.
Sara bathes Cid, dresses the wound on his jaw.
She tucks Cid in, holds him close. Kisses his forehead.
