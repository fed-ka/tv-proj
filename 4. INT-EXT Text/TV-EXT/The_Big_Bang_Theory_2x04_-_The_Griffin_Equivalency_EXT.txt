      (Leonard, Sheldon, Wolowitz)

      SHELDON IS AT HIS GREASE BOARD.  HE SCRIBBLES AN EQUATION, 
      THEN STEPS BACK TO LOOK AT IT.

                                    SHELDON

                Oh, well there's my missing neutrino.  *

                You were hiding from me as an 

                  unbalanced charge, weren't you, you 

                little sub-atomic dickens?

      LEONARD AND WOLOWITZ ENTER.

                                    LEONARD

                Hey, Sheldon.

                                    SHELDON

                Look, look, I found my missing 

                  neutrino.*

                Come on, we're going to apologize to 

                Raj and invite him to dinner.

                                    SHELDON

                  Apologize for what?

                                    LEONARD

                He came over last night with some 

                pretty good news and we weren't very 

                  supportive, some of us less so than 

                others.

                                  WOLOWITZ

                What Leonard's trying to say is you 

                were a colossal asshat.

                                    SHELDON

                Oh, I beg to differ.  Of the three of 

                us, I was by far the most supportive.

                                    LEONARD

                Really?  Do tell.

                Okay, let's try it this way: What if 

                this People Magazine thing is the best 

                Raj is ever going to achieve?

                                    SHELDON

                I had not considered that.  That's so sad.

                                    LEONARD

                (TO LEONARD)  He can feel sadness?

                                    LEONARD

                Not really.  It's what you and I would 

                call condescension.

      REVEALING KOOTHRAPPALI KNEELING AND SLIPPING THE PAPER.

                                  PENNY

                Raj, what are you doing?

        KOOTHRAPPALI STANDS UP AND SHEEPISHLY OFFERS HER THE NOTE.

                                  PENNY (CONT'D)

                No.  No notes.  If you have something 

                to say to me, say it.

      SHE STARES AT HIM.  KOOTHRAPPALI FIGHTS AN INTERNAL STRUGGLE, 
      AND USING ALL HIS WILLPOWER, MANAGES TO SQUEAK OUT:

                                  KOOTHRAPPALI

                  (STRAINED)  Sorry.

      PENNY'S STERN EXPRESSION MELTS INTO A SMILE.

                It's okay, sweetie.
