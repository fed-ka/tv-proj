  As members of the ABC Studios family, we all work very hard to create 

  quality original programming for our viewers. A very important aspect of 

  producing such programming is ensuring that certain information relating to 

  the series Revenge (the  Series ) remains confidential. In this regard, as 

  we begin work on the first season of this very exciting program, we would 

  like to emphasize that any disclosure of such confidential information to 

  third parties will have a serious and detrimental effect on the production 

  and the Series. As you are aware, ABC Studios has a strict policy 

  prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information. Accordingly, we 

  would like to remind each of you of your obligation to hold in strict 

  confidence, and not to disclose to any person (including your friends and 

  family members), any confidential information relating to the production, 

  including but not limited to any information about other cast and crew 

  members, upcoming episodes, the season finale, production schedules 

  and production methods. Steps should be taken to maintain the 

  confidentiality of scripts or any other confidential information to which you 

  are exposed, such as not discussing confidential information in public 

  areas or leaving scripts lying around unattended. As it is imperative that 

  we maintain the confidentiality of such information, ABC Studios will 

  investigate any unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and any 

  person who engages in such unauthorized disclosure will be subject to 

  disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 

 

 

 

  We look forward to the continued success of the Series and appreciate 

  your hard work.

      We start on the dark, deep swells of the North Atlantic as we 
      hear the voices of a small group singing  Happy Birthday to 
      you, happy birthday--  The song trails off abruptly.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Defense lawyers use the term 
                     duress  to describe the use of 
                    force, coercion, or psychological 
                    pressure exerted on a client in the 
                      commission of a crime.

      And as the camera pushes our way towards the magical, 
      twinkling coastline, we CUT INTO:


      A small Hamptons-ie tent is set up, a casually elegant dining 
      table inside. Emily is sitting at the head of the table in 
      front of a devil s food cake with the words  HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
      DANIEL  written on it, next to half opened gifts. But Emily s 
      not smiling. Rather, her face is filled with anxiety. 

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    When duress is applied to the 
                      emotionally unstable, the result 
                    can be as violent as it is 
                      unpredictable.

      Widen to see VICTORIA, CHARLOTTE, CONRAD, DECLAN, ASHLEY, 
      JACK, AMANDA, and DANIEL sitting frozen. As the shot 
      reverses, we see why: Tyler is pointing a gun at all of them. 
      He stalks the table, training the gun on each of them until 
      he arrives at Conrad. Pauses there a while.

                                  TYLER
                    Clock s ticking, Conrad. You have 
                    three seconds to tell everyone the 
                    truth about what really happened to 
                    David Clarke. 

      Conrad glances to Victoria. What should he do?

                                  TYLER (CONT'D)
                    Do it, or I swear, once again, 
                    someone else is going to die because 
                    you were too weak to own up to your 
                    lies. The question is... who?  REVENGE EP 111   "DURESS"  Blue Production Draft   11/3/11  2.


                                  CONRAD
                    Tyler, put the gun down, this 
                    doesn t involve them--

                                  TYLER
                    Wrong answer. 

      On that, Tyler swings the gun over, aiming directly at Emily.*

                                  TYLER (CONT D)
                    Good bye, Emily.

      ALL SOUND FALLS AWAY as we go TIGHT ON TYLER s FINGER as he 
      squeezes the trigger back on the gun in EXTREME SLOW MOTION , 
      and then, SMASH TO BLACK:

      NOLAN is on a chaise with his iPad, watching a tracking 
      system showing a RED DOT FLICKERING on a google-earth 
      satellite map of the SOUTHFORK INN. His waterlogged laptop is 
        disassembled into parts, drying out on a towel nearby. Emily 
      walks up. He ignores her, keeping his eyes on the screen.

                                  EMILY
                    I Googled  friendship  on the 
                      interwebs. Apparently when you have 
                    a fight with a friend you re 
                    supposed to apologize.

                                  NOLAN
                    Word of advice? Leave the joke 
                    cracking to me; you suck at it. 

                                  EMILY
                    And the apologizing? How m I doing 
                    there?

                                  NOLAN
                    I m no expert, but I think 
                    apologies are supposed to include 
                    the words  I m sorry. 

      Nolan s not entirely impressed. She sits next to him.

                                  EMILY
                    Trusting people is something I ve 
                    actively taught myself not to do.

                    What happened with you and Tyler 
                    took me off guard. But I believe 
                    you never set out to sabotage me. 

                                  NOLAN
                    On the contrary. All I ever set out 
                    to do was help you. And your dad. 
                          (beat, then)
                    As much as I hate to admit it, you 
                    were right about Tyler; I m a 
                    terrible judge of character. 

                                  EMILY
                    We all have weaknesses, Tyler s 
                    just very good at exploiting them. 

                                  NOLAN
                    And now he has all the ammo he 
                    needs. He stole my whale cam.

                                  EMILY
                    With all the video files on it?

                                  NOLAN
                    Including everything that happened 
                    at Lydia s. Now he has the physical 
                    evidence he needs to extort Conrad.

                                  EMILY
                    Or if we play it right, all the rope 
                    necessary to hang himself. Believe it 
                    or not, this might be good news.

                                  EMILY
                    Hopefully not long for this part of 
                    the world. I made sure Victoria 
                    found out she s in town.

                    First things first -- we need to

                    Until Big Ed comes back from his

                                  EMILY

                    Will you let me know where to find

                    clams, straight from the Stowaway.*

      The kids drop their pistols. He spots something up the beach.

                                  DAVID CLARKE (CONT D)
                    The clams need to cool off. I ll be 
                    back in a minute.

      David heads up the beach. Young Amanda and Young Jack open 
      the cooler, curious.

                                  YOUNG AMANDA
                    They look kind of gross.

                                  YOUNG JACK
                    Like alien food.

      Young Amanda laughs, returning us to...


      Emily looks at Jack.

                                  JACK
                    What do you think of her? 

                                  EMILY
                    Amanda? I don t know her that well. 

                                  JACK
                    Then what s your first impression?

                                  EMILY
                    That she makes you happy. Just be 
                    careful, that s all...

      Their eyes meet, then she checks her watch.

                    Oof, it s late. I have a million 
                    things to do.

      Emily steps onto the porch, the phone at her ear.

                                  EMILY
                    Tyler s unspooling at warp speed. *
                    Now where the hell is he?*


      This is a continuation of the Act 4 Flashback. David joins 
      Victoria. The children s backs are visible in the distance. 

                                  DAVID CLARKE
                    I spoke to Conrad at the office 
                    today, he seemed extra tense. Have 
                    you told him? 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Tonight. But I m quite sure he 
                    suspects it s coming. I sent Daniel 
                    to my mother s for the evening so I 
                    can finish this.

                                  DAVID CLARKE
                    Then it s really happening.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Yes. Finally. 

      He takes her hand and gives it a squeeze, afraid to do more.

                                  DAVID CLARKE
                    Come over when it s done. You can 
                    finally meet Amanda. And more 
                      importantly, she can finally meet 
                    you.

      A sea of emotions flash across Victoria s face. Then--

                                  VICTORIA
                    I ll call you when I m on my way. 
                    Nine o clock?

                                  DAVID CLARKE
                    I ll be home.

                    David, I-- I love you.

                                  DAVID CLARKE
                    I love you, too. See you later.  REVENGE EP 111   "DURESS"  Blue Production Draft   11/3/11  38.


      Victoria watches him go, then takes out her cell and dials.

                                  VICTORIA
                    It s all set. He ll be home 
                    tonight. Nine o clock.

      Victoria s voice is full of steely resolve, but as she 
      watches David race back up to the beach to join Amanda and 
      Jack, her eyes reveal her true torment at what she s just set 
      in motion.


      Alexander pounds on the door, then looks back at Nolan s car, 
      parked in the driveway. *

      Victoria notes their warmth as Emily comes to the stairs.

                    If everyone would like to head down

      Alexander looks in the windows by the pool as--

                                  CONRAD
                    Did you know she was back?

                                  VICTORIA
                    It came to my attention the other 
                    day.

                                  CONRAD
                    And you didn t think to mention it?

                                  VICTORIA
                    I have the situation under control. 
                    I m going to get close to her, find 
                    out what she s after, then dispose of 
                    her as necessary. But I m not overly 
                      concerned; so far she s just a pretty 
                    girl with cheap shoes and limited 
                    social graces.

                                  CONRAD
                          (pointed)
                    Sounds like someone I once knew.

      DANIEL watches them spar. Emily comes up, whispers to him.

                    remember were nothing like this.

      As the girls bond, CONRAD pulls Declan aside.

                                  CONRAD
                    Charlotte told me about her mother s 
                    little bribery attempt. Please accept 
                    my sincerest apologies.

                                  DECLAN
                    It s all right --

                                  CONRAD
                    No, it s not. You re a decent young 
                    man and deserve our respect. Victoria 
                    has certain blind spots. But don t 
                    judge the rest of us on her failings.

      Conrad places his hand paternally on his shoulder.

                    You re very important to Charlotte, 
                    which makes you important to me. If 
                    you ever need anything, all you 
                    have to do is ask.

      begin to sing,  Happy Birthday...  it becomes clear that 
      Emily is under duress. As she rounds the corner into the

      Tyler brandishes the gun at all of them. Emily catches eyes 
      with Victoria, who glances at the cake knife within Emily s

                    shooting anyone.

      Tyler turns to Conrad, focusing the gun on him.

                                  TYLER (CONT'D)
                    From your trashy affair with Lydia 
                    to your security goon getting 
                    himself murdered, seems like you re 
                    chock full of deep, dark secrets. 
                    Let s take it way back to David 
                    Clarke and the summer of  93

      Taking us back to the beginning of the show.

                                  TYLER (CONT D)
                    Clock s ticking, Conrad. You have 
                    three seconds to tell everyone the 
                    truth about what really happened to 
                    David Clarke. 

      Conrad glances to Victoria. What should he do?

                                  TYLER (CONT'D)
                    Do it, or I swear, once again, 
                    someone else is going to die because 
                    you were too weak to own up to your 
                    lies. The question is... who?

                                  CONRAD
                    Tyler, put the gun down, this 
                    doesn t involve them--

                                  TYLER
                    Wrong answer. 

      On that Tyler whips around, points the gun at Emily.

                                  TYLER (CONT D)
                    Good bye, Emily.

      ALL SOUND FALLS AWAY as we go TIGHT ON TYLER s FINGER as he 
      squeezes the trigger back on the gun in EXTREME SLOW MOTION , 

                                  ALEXANDER (O.S.)
                    Tyler!

      Tyler turns, confused, his finger easing, the gun still 
      pressed to Emily s head. Alex and Nolan come racing up shore.

                                  TYLER
                    Alex...? 

                                  ALEXANDER
                    Hey, little brother.
                          (approaching; calm)
                    I haven t heard from you in a 
                    while. I was worried. We all were.

      Daniel and Jack lock eyes, silently trying to communicate.   REVENGE EP 111   "DURESS"  Blue Production Draft   11/3/11  47.


                                  TYLER
                    Mom and Dad don t care about me. 
                    They cut me off! And you re just 
                    here so they can lock me up again!

      Alexander acts as if the gun isn t there, his voice soothing.

                                  ALEXANDER
                    That was a mistake. They want to 
                    make it up to you. C mon, let s go 
                    talk, just the two of us. 

      Tyler hesitates, and in that moment, Daniel and Jack rush 
      him, knocking him to the sand, the gun skidding away. 

                                  TYLER
                    Get off of me!

                                  JACK
                    Man, you re not going anywhere. 

      Daniel smashes a punch dead center into Tyler s face. And as 
      Jack and Daniel hold him down, everyone sighs with relief.*

      Amanda pulls Victoria aside, her curiosity piqued.

                                  AMANDA
                    What did Tyler mean when he said, 
                     the truth about David Clarke? 

                                  VICTORIA
                    That was just the ravings of a 
                    lunatic, dear. Take it all with a 
                    big grain of salt.

                                  JACK
                            (approaching Amanda)
                    You ready?

                                  AMANDA
                    Yeah. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Now that you re back in town, we 
                    should have you up to the house one 
                    day, get reacquainted.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Ashley will set it up.

      Victoria smiles, her plan in motion. REVEAL Emily standing *
      just to the side, having overheard everything...*


      POLICE HEADLIGHTS swirl through the room. Police officers *
      have cuffed Tyler. Conrad is holding Charlotte as she sobs, *
      Victoria beside them.*

                                  VICTORIA*
                    You re all right now, sweetheart. *
                      Everything s going to be okay. *

      But Charlotte just looks up at Conrad.*

                                  CHARLOTTE*
                    Take me home, Daddy?*

                                    CONRAD*
                    Of course.*

      Conrad leads Charlotte out as Victoria watches, an outsider *
      in her family yet again. Victoria looks for Daniel, sees -- *

      EMILY is in Daniel s arms.*

                                    DANIEL*
                    For a minute there, I thought I was *
                    gonna lose you.*

                                  EMILY*
                    Me, too. If you hadn t saved me...*

      He holds her tightly. A Police Officer frisks Tyler. He takes *
      a wallet out of Tyler s blazer pocket and opens it.*

                                  POLICE OFFICER*
                    What are you doing with Frank *
                    Stevens s wallet?*

                                  TYLER*
                    Someone planted that on me!*

      As the POLICE lead Tyler past Daniel and Emily, Tyler cocks *
      his hand like a gun and pretends to shoot them, his eyes *
      wild. The Police drag him out the door. Victoria sweeps over.*

                                  VICTORIA*
                    Emily, dear, what a horror. Are you *
                    all right?*  REVENGE EP 111   "DURESS"  Blue Production Draft   11/3/11  49.


                                  EMILY*
                    I m still shaking. I had no idea *
                    Tyler was so deranged.*

                                    DANIEL*
                    Tyler had Frank s wallet, mom... do *
                    you think he s the one who killed *
                    him?*

      Off Victoria, stunned. Emily catches eyes with Nolan. He *
      raises his glass to Emily, overhearing. Nicely done. *


      Ryan strides out to join Victoria, who has been expecting him.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I shudder to think what you charge 
                    for a late night house call.
