KITCHEN
Casey grabs the portable.
CASEY
Hello.
MAN
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
CASEY
So why did you dial it again?
MAN
To apologize.
CASEY
You're forgiven. Bye now.
MAN
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
Casey stands in front of a sliding glass door.
It's pitch black
outside.
CASEY
What?
MAN
I want to talk to you for a second.
CASEY
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
CLICK!
Casey hangs up.
A grin on her face.
KITCHEN
Popcorn sizzles in a pot on the stove.
Casey covers it with a
lid, reaching for the portable phone.
CASEY
Hello.
MAN
Why don't you want to talk to me?
CASEY
Who is this?
MAN
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
CASEY
(shaking the popcorn)
I don't think so.
MAN
What's that noise?
Casey smiles, playing along, innocently.
CASEY
Popcorn.
MAN
You're making popcorn?
CASEY
Uh-huh.
MAN
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
CASEY
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
MAN
Really? What?
CASEY
Just some scary movie.
MAN
Do you like scary movies?
CASEY
Uh-huh.
MAN
What's your favorite scary movie?
He's flirting with her.
Casey moves away from the stove and takes
a seat at the kitchen counter, directly in front of the glass
door.
CASEY
I don't know.
MAN
You have to have a favorite.
Casey thinks for second.
CASEY
Uh...HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the
guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around
and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
MAN
Guess.
CASEY
Uh...NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
MAN
Is that the one where the guy had knives
for fingers?
CASEY
Yeah...Freddy Krueger.
MAN
Freddy-that's right. I liked that movie.
It was scary.
CASEY
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
MAN
So, you gotta boyfriend?
CASEY
(giggling)
Why? You wanna ask me out?
MAN
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
CASEY
No.
MAN
You never told me your name.
Casey smiles, twirling her hair.
CASEY
Why do you want to know my name?
MAN
Because I want to know who I'm looking
at.
Casey spins around like lightning facing the glass door.
CASEY
What did you say?
MAN
I want to now who I'm talking to.
CASEY
That's not what you said.
MAN
What do you think I said?
Casey CLICKS on the outside light.
A flood light illuminates the
backyard.
Her eyes survey the grounds.
But it's empty.
No one's
there.
She turns the light out.
On the stove, the popcorn POPS.
CASEY
I have to go now.
MAN
Wait...I thought we were gonna go out.
CASEY
Nah, I don't think so...
MAN
Don't hang up on me.
CASEY
Gotta go.
MAN
Don't...
CLICK!
Casey hangs up.
She checks the glass door making sure
it's locked and then moves to the stove as...
THE PHONE RINGS.
She slides the popcorn from the stove, reaching for the phone.
CASEY
Yes?
MAN
I told you not to hang up on me.
CASEY
What do you want?
MAN
To talk.
CASEY
Dial someone else, okay?
MAN
You getting scared?
CASEY
No-bored.
CLICK.
She hangs up.
The phone RINGS again.
She grabs it.
CASEY
Listen, asshole...
MAN
(deadly serious)
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU
HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE
A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
Total silence.
He has gotten her full attention.
CASEY
Is this some kind of a joke?
MAN
More of a game, really.
Casey eyes the glass doors, then looks up the hallway to the front
doors...moving to it.
It's unlocked.
She bolts it.
CASEY
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
MAN
They'd never make it in time.
Casey moves her face flush against the door, her eye looking
through the peephole.
ANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE.
A distorted view of the front porch.
It is empty.
She relaxes a
bit, relieved.
CASEY
What do you want?
MAN
(pure evil)
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
Casey's jaw drops as total fear storms her face.
She hangs up the
phone, throwing it down on a side table when...
THE DOORBELL CHIMES.
Casey leaps out of her skin.
She turns to the door as it chimes
again.
CASEY
(calling out)
Who's there?
Another CHIME.
She moves to it.
CASEY
(louder)
Who's there?
No answer.
Fuck this.
It's time for the police.
She goes for
the portable phone. Just as she picks it up...
IT RINGS.
Casey almost drops it, losing her breath...
She brings it to her ear with trembling hands, saying
nothing...listening, waiting...
A long silence.
And then.
MAN
You should never say "Who's there?".
Don't you watch scary movies? It's a
death wish.
Casey clutches the wall, nearly collapsing.
She tries her
damndest to hang tough.
CASEY
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun
now you better leave me alone or else.
MAN
Or else what?
CLOSE ON her face, her mind thinking, calculating...
CASEY
My boyfriend will be here any second and
he'll be pissed when I tell him...
MAN
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
Busted.
She holds steady.
CASEY
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll
be here any second and your ass better
be gone.
MAN
Sure...
CASEY
I swear it. And he's big and plays
football and will beat the shit out
of you.
MAN
I'm getting scared.
CASEY
I'm telling you the truth.
I lied before...
MAN
I believe you...
CASEY
So you better leave.
MAN
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Silence.
Casey buckles at the knees, losing it.
CASEY
How do you know his name?
MAN
Go to the back door and turn on the porch
light--again.
Casey, terrified, forces herself to move.. staggering to the
kitchen...to the glass doors.
Her shaky hand finds the light
switch...she hits it.
The back yard is lit.
Sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the backyard is a big,
line backer of a guy, her boyfriend...
STEVE
tied and gagged.
He's been roughed up, but he's alive.
CLOSE ON his eyes..wide in fear..staring at his girlfriend,
pleading with her.
CASEY
Oh Goddddd...
Casey SCREAMS.
Her hand moves to the lock on the door.
MAN
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Terror rides Casey's face.
She's petrified.
CASEY
Where are you?
MAN
Guess.
Her eyes search the yard, combing bushes, trees.
He could be
anywhere-anywhere.
CASEY
(begging)
Please don't hurt him.
MAN
That all depends on you.
CASEY
Why are you doing this?
Tears find their way, streaming down Casey's face.
MAN
I wanna play a game.
CASEY
No...
MAN
Then he dies. Right now.
CASEY
NOOO!
MAN
Which is it?
A long silence.
Casey touches the glass...staring at STEVE...this
big jock of a guy is crying too.
CASEY
What kind of game?
MAN
Turn off the light.
Her hand goes to the switch...Steve tugs and pulls at his
straps...as if begging her...his face sweat and tears...
CLICK
He disappears in the darkness.
Casey moves away from the glass,
back toward the living room, unbelieving, horrified.
MAN
Here's how we play. I ask a question. If
you get it right-Steve lives.
Three curtainless windows line one wall.
Casey crouches down
behind the couch, tipping a lamp cord from it's socket, darkening
the room.
Her body quivers.
CASEY
Please don't do this...
MAN
Come on. It'll be fun.
CASEY
No...please.
MAN
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
CASEY
(begging)
..please...
MAN
I'll even give you a warm up question.
CASEY
Don't do this. I can't..
MAN
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
CASEY
No...
MAN
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie,
remember? He had a white mask, he
stalked the baby-sitters.
Casey goes silent...a nervous wreck...she can barely speak much
less think.
CASEY
I don't know...
MAN
Come on, yes you do.
CASEY
Please..stop...
Casey is SOBBING.
MAN
What's his name?
CASEY
I can't think.
Casey has officially reached hysteria, petrified beyond all
reality.
MAN
Steve's counting on you.
Suddenly...through tears...Godsent...
CASEY
(a whisper)
Michael...Michael Myers.
MAN
YES!
Casey SIGHS...relieved.
MAN
Now for the real question.
CASEY
NOOOO....
MAN
But you're doing so well.
CASEY
Please go away! Leave us alone!
MAN
Then answer the question. Same category.
Casey is a blubbering, wet mass on the floor.
CASEY
..please..no...
MAN
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
A mad smile purses Casey's lips.
She knows this.
She leaps up,
through tears, screaming...
CASEY
Jason! Jason!...JASON!
A slight PAUSE.
MAN
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
CASEY
No it's not. It was Jason.
MAN
Afraid not.
CASEY
It was Jason. I saw that godamned movie
twenty times. It was Jason.
MAN
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER
-Mrs.Vorhees was the original killer. Jason
didn't show up until the sequel.
Casey is stupefied.
CASEY
You tricked me...
MAN
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round.
But poor Steve...I'm afraid...he's out.
This implication sends Casey running to the kitchen...to the glass
doors.
She flips on the porch lights to see...
STEVE
eyes wide, sitting in the lawn chair...his belly gaping open...a
mass of blood and ripped flesh...his insides lay on the ground
between his feet...steam rising.
A SCREAM erupts from the bottom of her soul as Casey collapse on
the floor...nearly passing out.
CLOSE ON her face...pale and
ghostly white.
She SOBS.
MAN
Final question. Are you ready?
She doesn't answer.
A long, maddening silence.
Casey reaches up
and CLICKS off the light, making Steve go away...wishing,
hoping...
CASEY
..leave me alone..please...
MAN
Answer the question and I will.
Casey is curled up on the floor like an infant, rocking slowly
back and forth.
MAN
What door am I at?
CASEY
What?
MAN
There are two doors to your house. A
front door and a back one. If you answer
correctly-you live.
From where Casey sits she can see both front and back doors.
She
deliberates...with her last bit of strength she tries to
strategize.
Eyeing both, the front door...the back door trying to
decide between the two.
CASEY
Don't make me...I can't...I won't.
MAN
Your call.
In the darkness, Casey crawls to the kitchen counter-she leans up
and grabs a long, sharp knife.
Casey looks around her...she looks down the hall to the front
door...then turns back to the kitchen glass door as it suddenly...
SHATTERS TO BITS...
as a lawn chair come flying through it.
Exploding glass sprays
everywhere.
This incites Casey like fire.
She springs to her feet...bolting
out of the kitchen as a SHADOW moves quickly through the shattered
doorframe.
ANGLE ON CASEY
Somewhere in the house, back flat against a window, listening to
FEET ON CRACKING GLASS.
She turns and unlocks the latch, quietly
sliding it up. She can hear him move through the foyer...to the
front door.
Casey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window.
She
holds the knife in one hand, the phone in the other.
Casey eases out the window, fumbling, dropping the knife back in
the house.
She starts to reach for it.
Fuck it, she takes off...
FOYER
The father sees straight back into the kitchen...the shattered
patio door.
FATHER
Jesus...
MOTHER
What is it? Where's Casey?
FATHER
(calling out)
Casey? Casey?
In a split second they're both panic stricken.
The father begins
searching the house frantically.
The mother is hysterical.
FOYER
Back in the house.
MOTHER
Where is she?
FATHER
Call the police.
The mother moves
to the phone in the foyer, picks it up...There
is no dial tone.
She jiggles the base.
FATHER
(searching)
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the
police, goddammit.
MOTHER
The phone's dead.
The...the softest...faintest voice is heard...
CASEY
(from phone)
..help me...
MOTHER
She's here, God, I can hear her.
Where's my baby?
The husband returns to the foyer finding his wife clinging to the
phone.
FATHER
Where is she?
MOTHER
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God,
I can hear her.
The father upturns the living room.
FATHER
Casey! Casey!
MOTHER
Not my daughter...not my...
The husband grabs hold of his wife.
FATHER
Get in the car and drive down to
the Mackenzie's.
The other throws the front door open and rushes out...the father
moves through the house when a SCREAM echoes out.
That of his
wife.
He tears off for the front door.
BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT
A teenage girl's room.
Neat and pinkish.
On the bed, amongst age-
old stuffed animals lie opened school books. The CAMERA PANS to a
desk against the wall where...
SIDNEY PRESCOTT
a young girl of 17, sits, her face glued to the computer monitor
in front of her.
CLOSE ON her face.
Sharp and clever with deep,
lonely eyes.
She's comfortable in a plain, flannel nightgown.
Her hands are at work, typing feverishly, when suddenly...
CRASH-BOOM
A noise behind her.
She turns abruptly, eyeing an open window
across the room. A SCRATCHING sound.
She stands and moves toward
it.
BEDROOM
Sid SCREAMS...pulling away from the figure...breaking free,
falling back onto the floor.
VOICE
(o.c.)
Hey...it's just me.
Sid looks up to see...
BILLY LOOMIS
A young, strapping boy of seventeen.
Handsome and alluring.
A
star quarterback/ class president type of guy.
He sports a smile
that could last for days.
SIDNEY
Billy? What the...
BILLY
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
SIDNEY
What are you doing here?
BILLY
You sleep in THAT?
Billy pulls himself through the window.
SIDNEY
(whispering)
My dad's in the other room.
BILLY
I'll only stay a sec.
Suddenly...
The bedroom door BURSTS open.
The doorknob catches on the open
closet door behind it jamming it, holding it in place.
VOICE
(from behind door)
What's going on in there?
Billy quickly rolls out of sight behind the bed.
Sidney unjams
the door to reveal...
MR. PRESCOTT, late 40's, a severe presence.
A distracted man,
nervous and pre-occupied.
MR. PRESCOTT
Are you okay?
SIDNEY
Can you knock?
MR. PRESCOTT
I heard screaming.
SIDNEY
No you didn't.
MR. PRESCOTT
No? Oh, well...I'm hitting the sack. My
flight leaves first thing in the morning.
Now the expo runs all weekend so I
won't be back til Sunday. There's cash
on the table and I'll be staying at the
Raleigh Hilton...
SIDNEY
..out at the airport...
MR. PRESCOTT
..so call if you need me.
SIDNEY
Got it.
He gives the bedroom a quick once over.
MR. PRESCOTT
I coulda swore I heard screaming.
Sidney distracts him, giving him a peck on the cheek.
SIDNEY
Have a good trip.
MR. PRESCOTT
Sleep tight, sweetie.
He gives her a wink and pulls the door closed.
Billy reappears.
BILLY
Close call.
SIDNEY
What are you doing here?
Billy takes a flying leap and lands on the bed.
BILLY
It just occurred to me that I've never
snuck through your bedroom window.
SIDNEY
Now that it's out of your system.
BILLY
And I was home, bored, watching
television, THE EXORCIST was on
and it got me thinking of you.
SIDNEY
Oh it did?
BILLY
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good
stuff was cut out and I started thinking
about us and how two years ago, we started
off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R"
rating on our way to an NC17. And how
things have changed and, lately, we're just
sot of...edited for television.
SIDNEY
So you thought you could sneak in my
window and we would
have little bump-
bump.
BILLY
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your
underwear rule. I just thought we might do
some on top of the clothes stuff.
She snuggles up next to him, planting a kiss on his lips.
Passionate and gentle.
He, however, reacts like a shark, moving
on top of her, his hands everywhere as he presses into
her...Sidney breaks away.
SIDNEY
Time to go, stud bucket.
Billy sits up.
His heart isn't racing...it's POUNDING.
BILLY
See what you do to me.
Sweat has popped out all over his forehead, his breathing heavy.
SIDNEY
You know what my dad will do to you?
BILLY
I'm going...I'm going.
He moves to the window.
She follows, motioning to his wound.
SIDNEY
I appreciate the romantic gesture.
She gives him a kiss goodnight.
Sweet and simple.
BILLY
(whisper)
Hey..about the sex stuff. I'm not trying
to rush you. I was only half serious.
She kisses him again as he eases through the window.
SIDNEY
Would you settle for a PG-13
relationship?
BILLY
What's that?
She pulls her flannel gown open for a split second...flashing her
left breast.
His mouth drops open...surprise, shock.
Their eyes
meet.
They share a smile.
SIDNEY
Get outa here.
SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
CLOSE on Sidney snuggling her pillow, sleeping peacefully when...
THE RADIO ALARM BLASTS from the night table loud enough to wake
the dead.
Sidney bolts up.
DISC JOCKEY
(from radio)
..found brutally murdered...
CLICK.
Sidney, quick with the reflexes, shuts it off instantly.
A car trunk SLAMS shut outside.
Sidney pulls herself out of bed and leans to the window just in
time to see her Dad jumping in his car.
She half waves down at
him but he doesn't see her.
He's as good as gone, pulling out of
the driveway and disappearing down the road.
A moment as Sidney stands at the window, staring out after him.
CLASSROOM - LATER
A frumpy old woman, MRS. TATE, faces her class.
Her hands clasped
together.
A tragic look upon her face.
MRS. TATE
..a terrible tragedy. An unbearable
loss. It's days like today we need
prayer in school...
Sidney sits near the rear of the room.
The desk in front of her
sits vacant.
Sidney can't take her eyes of it.
The door opens and a student opens with a slip of paper.
He hand
s it to Mrs. Tate.
MRS. TATE
Sidney. It appears to be your turn.
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
The room is at capacity...wall to wall with police, and the likes.
Some sit, stand, lean...
SHERIFF BURKE, a round man in his fifties, wipes the stress from
his face.
SHERIFF BURKE
Who's up next?
A young officer looks at the clipboard.
This is DEPUTY RILEY,
better known as DEWEY.
He's a big guy, 20's, handsome in a
scrubbed-clean boyish way.
DEWEY
Sidney Prescott.
Sheriff Burke gestures to bring her in.
PRINCIPAL HIMBRY, 50's,
an old codger of a man wearing a sour face speaks up.
MR. HIMBRY
Sidney Prescott. She was daughter of...
DEWEY
We all know Sidney, Mr. Himbry.
SHERIFF BURKE
How she doin'?
MR. HIMBRY
She's adjusted well. Maintains an "A"
average. You never know she...
Himbry stops short, seeing Sidney in the doorway.
He rises and
seats her.
SHERIFF BURKE
Hi Sidney.
SIDNEY
Sheriff Burke. Dewey.
Dewey shakes his head seriously.
DEWEY
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
SHERIFF BURKE
How is everything?
SIDNEY
Good.
SHERIFF BURKE
And your Dad? How's he doing?
SIDNEY
We're fine. Thanks.
MR. HIMBRY
We'll be brief, Sidney. The police have a
few questions they'd like to ask you...
Sidney eyes them all nervously.
BEDROOM - LATER
Sidney is on the telephone.
SIDNEY
(into phone)
You sure I can stay over?
My dad won't
be back til Sunday.
TATUM
(through phone)
No prob. I'll pick you up after
practice.
SIDNEY
Tell your mom I said thanks.
TATUM
Yeah, yeah...are you okay?
SIDNEY
Uh-huh, it's just...you know, the police
and reporters...it brings it all back.
TATUM
I'll be there by seven. I promise
SIDNEY
Thanks, Tatum.
TATUM
Later.
Sidney hangs up.
She takes a seat at her computer and boots it
up.
She sits in front of it staring at the blue screen...her own
reflection staring back.
LIVING ROOM - LATER
Sidney comes down the stairs, her arms carrying a change of
clothes, toothbrush, make-up...
She opens the hall closet and pulls a small overnight bag from the
top shelf.
Moving into the living room she loads it up, plopping
down on the sofa, hitting the TV remote.
CLOSE ON THE SCREEN
A news reporter fades in.
REPORTER #1
(on TV)
The entire nation was shocked today by
the teen murders in North Carolina...
Sidney switches channels.
REPORTER #2
The State Bureau of Investigation has
joined forces with local authorities to
help catch what the Governor has called
the most heinous...
The channel switches again.
Gale weathers appears, standing in
front of the school.
Her white teeth gleaming.
GALE
This is not the first time the small town
of Bayboro has endured such tragedy. Only
a year ago, Maureen Prescott, wife and
mother, was found raped and murdered...
An old black and white snapshot fills the screen-a woman,
beautiful and familiar.
CLOSE ON SIDNEY
eyes frozen, mesmerized by the image.
Suddenly she CLICKS the TV
off.
Her eyes go to the clock on the end table.
5:45 PM.
Her
eyes then move to the framed photo next to it...the same black and
white photo stares at her...a healthy, vibrant woman.
An older
version of Sidney.
Sidney curls up on the sofa closing her eyes tight...
LIVING ROOM - LATER
The clock on the end table reads 7:15 PM.
Sidney is fast asleep
on the couch.
The phone RINGS.
Sidney leaps up grabbing the
portable phone.
TATUM
(from phone)
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
SIDNEY
(eyes clock)
It's past seven.
TATUM
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite
it til way after ten.
SIDNEY
I'm not worried.
TATUM
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER
and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in
ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you
pause it just right you can see his penis.
SIDNEY
Whatever. Just hurry.
TATUM
Bye.
She hangs up the phone.
It immediately RINGS again.
SIDNEY
(into phone)
Tatum?
MAN'S VOICE
(from phone)
Hello, Sidney.
IT'S HIM.
THE VOICE FROM BEFORE.
SIDNEY
Hi. Who is this?
MAN
You tell me.
Sidney thinks, trying to place his voice.
It sounds a little
distorted.
SIDNEY
I have no idea.
MAN
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders
and all, it's like right out of a horror
movie or something.
SIDNEY
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are
you calling from work? Tatum's on her
way over.
MAN
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
SIDNEY
I like that thing you're doing with your
voice, Randy. It's sexy.
MAN
What's your favorite scary movie?
SIDNEY
Don't start. You know I don't watch that
shit.
MAN
And why is that?
SIDNEY
(playing along)
Because they're all the same. It's
always some stupid killer stalking some
big breasted girl-who can't act-who
always runs up the stairs when she should
be going out the front door. They're
ridiculous.
A brief silence.
MAN
Are you alone in the house?
SIDNEY
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me,
Randy.
MAN
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
SIDNEY
So who are you?
MAN
The question is not who am I. The
question is where am I?
SIDNEY
So where are you?
MAN
Your front porch.
This gives her pause.
She moves to the window and pulls aside the
drapes.
SIDNEY
Why would you call me from my
front porch?
MAN
That's the original part.
ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW.
She can't quite see all of the porch.
SIDNEY
Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff.
Sidney goes to the front door.
She unlocks the bolt, unsnags the
chain, and pulls the door open...revealing the front porch...
COMPLETELY EMPTY.
She steps out onto it, phone still in hand.
A single light shines
overhead illuminating the porch, but little beyond.
Darkness is
all around.
SIDNEY
So where are you?
MAN
Right here.
Sidney peers out into the darkness past thick shrubs that grow on
either side of the porch.
SIDNEY
Can you see me right now?
MAN
Uh-huh.
SIDNEY
What am I doing?
She sticks her finger up her nose, pretending to pick.
Silence.
No answer.
SIDNEY
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry.
Bye now.
MAN
If you hang up, you'll die just like your
mother.
Sidney stops dead in her tracks, speechless.
MAN
(deadly)
Do you want to die, Sidney? Your mother
didn't.
His seriousness unnerves her.
Sid flies off the handle.
SIDNEY
FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN!
She hangs up on him.
Moves back inside the house.
Locks, chains,
and bolts the door when...
A FIGURE COMES LEAPING OUT OF THE HALL CLOSET
rushing her, ramming into her side..the phone flies..the FIGURE is
on top of her as she goes down...SCREAMING...
She looks up to see the FIGURE, darkly dressed with a pale,
distorted face, white and ghostly...a mask.
Her instincts surface and she kicks up with her foot making the
contact with his leg...he topples over...coming right at her, his
hand finding her neck.
Suddenly, along, silver blade appears
above her.
Sidney pulls, jerks, twists...finally she lifts her torso forward
knocking the FIGURE off her...sending him reeling into the living
room.
Wasting no time, Sidney leaps to her feet.
She moves to the front door, unlocks it...pulls it open...it
catches on the chain.
Shit!
She pushes it closed again looking
behind her..the FIGURE has risen, knife in hand.
Sidney pulls on the chain and then-inexplicably turns and...
RUNS UP THE STAIRS.
The FIGURE right behind her.
UPSTAIRS LANDING
The FIGURE leaps at Sidney taking hold of her foot, she grabs
madly at the wall...her hands grasp a framed painting-a quiet
country home, subdued colors, done in oils-she rips it from the
wall swinging it behind her...
It catches the FIGURE head on, smashing against his skull, sending
him backwards, tumbling down the stairs.
Sidney races to her
bedroom...
BEDROOM
She locks the door shut, the pulls her closet door open, placing
the edge right at the door knob just as...
THE FIGURE POUNDS AGAINST THE BEDROOM DOOR...
ramming it, it rips open, but the closet door catches it in a
crazy vice-like hold.
Sidney grabs the desk phone.
It's dead...off the hook downstairs.
The figure rushes the door several times..the frame splinters..but
won't give.
Sidney is at her computer, she punches at the keypad madly.
CLOSE ON SCREEN AS WORDS APPEAR.
FAX MODEM
9-1-1 SEND
The knife slashes through the crack in the door wildly.
ON SCREEN AGAIN
HELP KILLER
34 ELM ST
Sidney presses SEND when it occurs to her-all is quiet.
The
FIGURE is gone.
A fearful silence.
She looks around...the only
sound her own rapid, terrified BREATHING.
ON THE SCREEN
"Stay calm.
Police enroute."
Suddenly a NOISE at the window...Sidney looks up to see...
BILLY
her boyfriend, staring at her, surprised.
SIDNEY
Oh Billy...Please...God...
BILLY
I heard screaming. The door was locked.
Are you okay...
SIDNEY
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Billy pulls himself through the window.
As he does, a small black
object falls from his dark jeans.
It hits the floor as Sidney
eyes it...a sleek, compact cellular phone.
Sidney stops in her tracks.
Their eyes meet...an eternity.
A
SIREN is heard in the distance.
Sidney bolts...
BILLY
Hey...wait...what's goin..
Billy reaches for her.
Sidney unblocks the bedroom door and tears
out of the room.
LANDING
Sidney nearly falls down the stairs...
FOYER
She rips the chain off the door, pulls it open, coming face to
face with a white, ghostly mask.
A massive SCREAM erupts from her gut as...
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK
to find Dewey-Deputy Riley, holding it.
Red lights flash, sirens
BLAST vas car after car surrounds the house.
Sidney falls into the safety of Dewey's arms.
POLICE STATION
A small town station.
The bull pen is a little square room with
four desks and tonight--it's hopping.
Cops everywhere.
SHERIFF'S OFFICE
Sidney sits at a desk drinking a cup of water.
She wears the
Sheriff's jacket over her shoulders.
Dewey approaches.
SIDNEY
Did you reach my Dad?
DEWEY
You're sure it was the Hilton?
SIDNEY
At the airport.
DEWEY
He's not registered. Could he have gone
to another hotel?
SIDNEY
I don't know. I guess.
DEWEY
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Sidney stares blankly, numb.
SHERIFF'S OFFICE
Billy sits opposite Sheriff Burke.
Next to Billy, sits his
father, HANK LOOMIS, an older version of Billy.
SHERIFF BURKE
What are you doing with a cellular
telephone, son?
MR. LOOMIS
It's my phone. He was just playing
around with it.
SHERIFF BURKE
You got some ideas of playing around, boy.
BILLY
I didn't call anyone with it. I just
took it for fun.
MR. LOOMIS
Everybody's got one now. Why don't you
check the phone bill for chrissakes.
Call my carrier--AirFone Comp. They'll
have records of every number dialed.
SHERIFF BURKE
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were
you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
BILLY
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
SHERIFF BURKE
You rode your bike out there?
BILLY
Yes, sir.
SHERIFF BURKE
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night too?
MR. LOOMIS
(surprised)
You were out last night?
BILLY
I watched TV for awhile but the I felt
like going for a bike ride.
SHERIFF BURKE
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
BILLY
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone,
Sheriff.
SHERIFF BURKE
We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The
governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows
who else on their way down here.
Billy fights tears.
BILLY
This is crazy. I didn't do it.
Sheriff Burke eyes him up and down, very carefully.
POLICE BULL PEN - MINUTES LATER
Tatum has joined Sidney.
The sheriff's door opens and Billy is
led out by a coupla UNIFORMS.
Burke and Dewey appear in the door
watching Tatum comfort Sidney.
OUT OF EAR SHOT
DEWEY
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's
and WalMart. Neither of which keep
purchase records.
SHERIFF BURKE
What about the cellular phone bill?
DEWEY
They're pulling Loomis' account. But
it'll be morning before we see something.
You think he did it?
SHERIFF BURKE
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a
chance. But these kids today...damn if I
know.
TATUM
(o.s.)
Hey...Dewey. Can we go now?
DEWEY
Hold up a sec...
SHERIFF BURKE
She staying with you?
DEWEY
We haven't located her Dad yet.
TATUM
(o.s.)
Goddammit, Dewey!
Dewey turns to her, his face red.
DEWEY
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this
badge you treat me like a man of the law.
TATUM
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're
ready to go.
SHERIFF BURKE
Use the back way. Avoid the circus.
TATUM'S BEDROOM - LATER
A spacious bedroom.
Typical.
Tatum and Sidney lay on the bed.
They both wear night shirts.
TATUM
God, I loved it. "I'll send you a copy."
BAM! Bitch went down. "I'll send you a
copy." BAM! Sid--SuperBitch!
Dewey appears in the doorway holding a bag of ice.
DEWEY
I thought you might want some ice for
that right hook.
Sidney sits up, takes the ice, and puts it on her hand.
DEWEY
I'll be right next door. Try to get some
sleep.
Dewey moves back out the door.
SIDNEY
Any word on my Dad?
DEWEY
(turning to her)
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need
anything...
TATUM
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Dewey smiles, pulling the door closed on his way out.
Sidney lies
back down.
SIDNEY
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
TATUM
Just like old times, ain't it?
SIDNEY
No, nothing's like it used to be.
Sidney rolls over at her side, away from Tatum.
A telephone RINGS somewhere in the house.
TATUM
Do you really think Billy did it?
SIDNEY
He was there, Tatum.
TATUM
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was
destined to have a flaw.
A KNOCK at the door.
It opens and a friendly, graying woman pops
in.
This is MAMA RILEY.
She wears a comforting smile.
MAMA RILEY
Telephone, dear.
TATUM
Who is it?
MAMA RILEY
It's for Sid
SIDNEY
My Dad?
Mama Riley shakes her head sadly.
TATUM
Take a message.
SIDNEY
It's alright. I'll get it.
Sidney takes off out the door.
Mama Riley motions to Tatum.
MAMA RILEY
(whispers)
How is she?
Tatum shrugs.
HALLWAY
Sidney grabs the phone at the end of the hall.
SIDNEY
Hello?
MAN
(from phone)
Hello Sidney.
IT'S HIM.
The CAMERA does a Hitchcock as Sidney's entire body
goes weak..his VOICE moving through her..invading her.
She CRIES
OUT.
SIDNEY
NOOOOOO...
Mama Riley turns in the doorway.
Tatum comes bolting out of the
bedroom.
MAN
(from phone)
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy
doesn't stand a chance with you.
SIDNEY
LEAVEMEALONE!
MAN
Looks like you fingered the wrong
guy...again.
SIDNEY
Who are you?
TATUM
Hang up, Sid.
MAN
Don't worry. You'll find out soon
enough. I promise.
Mama Riley BEATS on a closed bedroom door.
MAMA RILEY
Dewey! Dewey!
MAN
This is gonna be fun, Sidney. Just like
old times.
CLICK.
Dewey flies out of his room wearing only his boxers...holding his
gun.
DEWEY
What? What?
The phone goes dead.
Sidney stands frozen.
KITCHEN - MORNING
Sidney and Tatum sit at the kitchen table, dressed and ready for
school as Mama Riley serves up breakfast.
A small television sits
on the counter BLARING.
Dewey, in uniform, stands near the door, talking on the phone.
MAMA RILEY
I think you girls really should stay home
today.
TATUM
Your objection is duly noted.
SIDNEY
I'd rather be around a lot of people,
Mama Riley.
From the TV, Sidney hears her name, "SIDNEY PRESCOTT..."
All eyes
go to the television.
REPORTER
(on TV)
..who escaped a vicious attack last night
was the daughter of Maureen Prescott who
was brutally killed last year when
convicted murderer Cotton Weary...
INSERT of COTTON WEARY, in prison fatigues.
A once handsome man,
now haggard and worn.
REPORTER
(cont'd)
..broke into their home and savagely
raped and tortured the deceased. Cotton
Weary is currently awaiting appeal for
the death sentence handed down after the
young Sidney testified against him. She
was the key witness in the state's
prosecution...
SIDNEY
It's never gonna stop. Is it?
Dewey is off the phone.
DEWEY
Billy was released. His cellular bill
was clean. He didn't make those calls.
SIDNEY
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not
making it up.
DEWEY
I know. We're checking every cellular
account in the county. Any calls made to
you or Casey Becker are being cross-
referenced. It's gonna take time but
we'll find him.
SIDNEY
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Riley shakes his head "no".
PATROL CAR
Dewey pulls up in front of the school.
Tatum hops out while Sid
lingers, suddenly unsure.
Dewey takes notice.
DEWEY
Hey, it's school. You'll be safe here.
Sidney forces herself out of the jeep as a microphone is shoved in
her face...
REPORTER
How does it feel to almost be brutally
murdered?
Dewey leaps from the car, intercepting the reporter.
DEWEY
Leave the girl alone, will ya? She wants
to go to school.
Sidney eyes the newsvan that's pulled up behind her.
The side
door slides open and Gale Weathers steps out.
TATUM
Come on, Sid.
SIDNEY
Just a sec...I need to talk to someone.
She heads over to Gale.
Just before the bell.
The hallway is congested with students
heading to class.
Tatum is at her locker with Sidney.
SIDNEY
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
TATUM
I want you to meet me here right after
class, okay?
Billy appears in the crowd, with Stu tagging behind.
Tatum spots
him first.
TATUM
Shit, what is he doing here?
SIDNEY
I bet he's pissed.
TATUM
Just ignore him. You had good reason to
think what you did.
Billy and Stu approach.
Billy's face is solemn.
BILLY
Hi, Sid. Can we talk a sec?
Sidney says nothing.
She can barely look at him.
Tatum
intervenes.
TATUM
You know if I were accused of carving up
two people, I'd take the opportunity to
skip school.
STU
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
BILLY
Talk to me, Sid.
Suddenly, a SCREAM erupts.
All eyes go to a GHOST MASKED STUDENT
running down the hall, screaming wildly, running amuck.
SIDNEY
Why are they doing this?
STU
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Billy punches Stu in the side.
STU
Owwww...
BILLY
You open your mouth and stupidity pours
out.
STU
Sorry.
Sidney, clearly upset, takes off down the hall.
Billy races off
after her.
TATUM
(yelling)
Stay away from her, Billy.
Tatum SLAMS her locker door shut as the bell RINGS.
CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER
With first period underway, the halls have cleared.
One or two
struggling students can be seen rushing to class.
Sidney moves quickly down the hall, rounding a corner, running
smack into...
BILLY
They collide hard catching Sidney off guard, scaring the life out
of her.
She falls backwards, but Billy catches her fall.
SIDNEY
Jesus, SHIT!
BILLY
Hey, hey, it's just me.
Sidney pulls away from him quickly.
Billy feels the slight.
BILLY
What? You don't still think it's me?
Sidney catches her breath.
SIDNEY
No...I don't...it's just...Oh God, Billy,
someone was there, someone tried to
kill me.
BILLY
The police say I scared him off. It
wasn't me, Sid.
SIDNEY
I know. He called again last night at
Tatum's house.
BILLY
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in
jail, remember?
SIDNEY
I'm so sorry...please understand.
BILLY
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend
who would rather accuse me of being a
psychopathic killer than touch me.
SIDNEY
You know that's not true.
BILLY
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
SIDNEY
No...
BILLY
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too
pushy?
SIDNEY
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm
still adjusting to my mom.
BILLY
It's been a year since she died.
SIDNEY
(correcting him)
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
BILLY
When are you gonna let that go, Sid?
When my mom left my dad--I just accepted
it. This is the way it is. She's not coming
back.
SIDNEY
(sharply)
Your parents split up. It's not the same
thing. Your mom left town, she's not in
a coffin somewhere.
BILLY
You have to move on, Sid.
Sidney starts to walk away but turns back, angry.
SIDNEY
I'm glad to know you're coping so well
with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so
perfect. Some of us are just trying to
hold on.
Sidney disappears through a door marked GIRL'S BATHROOM, leaving
Billy alone in the hallway.
He SMACKS his forehead, pissed at
himself.
GIRL'S BATHROOM
Large and spacious.
Closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a
row of sinks and a huge mirror.
Sidney enters as TWO GIRLS tinkle
and talk--each from their respective stalls.
GIRL #1
She was never attacked. I think she made
it all up.
GIRL #2
Why would she lie about it?
GIRL #1
For attention. The girl has some serious
issues.
Sidney listens intently.
A toilet FLUSHES.
Sidney quickly jumps in a stall, hiding, just
as GIRL #1 appears from a stall.
She looks like that voice--a
snotty little twit.
GIRL #1
What if she did it? What if Sidney
killed Casey and Steve?
GIRL #2
And why would she do that?
GIRL #1
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed
them both in a jealous rage.
Another toilet FLUSHES.
GIRL #2
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve?
She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
GIRL #1
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
INSIDE THE STALL Sidney listens.
Her face weakening.
GIRL #2
You're evil.
GIRL #1
Please, it's common knowledge. Her
mother was a trollop.
GIRL #2 appears from her stall--another twit.
They both stand in
front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces.
GIRL #2
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get
butchered.
GIRL #1
And it fucked her up royally. Think
about it. It makes perfect sense. Her
mom's death leaves her distraught and
hostile at a cruel and inhumane world,
she's disillusioned, where's God, etc.
Completely suicidal. And one day she
snaps. She wants to kill herself but
realizes teen suicide is out this year.
And homicide is a much healthier
therapeutic expression.
From the stall, Sidney listens, her heart pounding, jaw quivering.
GIRL #2
Where do you get this shit?
GIRL #1
Ricki Lake.
The two girls exit.
Sidney moves out of the stall, catching her
reflection in the mirror.
SIDNEY
Pathetic.
Water DRIPS somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind WHISTLES in from
the cracked transom above the bathroom door.
It sound almost like
a whisper,
"Siddneey..."
Sidney spins around.
What the...
She checks out the bathroom.
The doors to the stalls are all closed.
She bends down and scans
beneath them, looking for feet.
No one.
Nothing.
Sidney turns back to the mirror.
Suddenly...
MAN
(o.c. whisper)
Siddneey...
Unmistakable this time.
The VOICE strikes Sidney like a nail
through the eye.
It comes from one of the stalls.
She stands
thunderstruck, eyeing the stalls thru the mirror.
SIDNEY
Is someone there?
A long, morose silence.
And then:
MAN
(softly, simply)
It's me, Sidney.
Sidney spins around.
Fuck no!
HE'S HERE.
Terror floods her
face.
She eyes the exit door, then the row of stalls she must
pass to get to it.
She checks under the stalls again.
Nothing...where the fuck is
he?
She takes a step forward when...
TWO FEET step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall.
Sidney's face draws tight as the stall door begins to CREAK open.
She bolts forward, making a break for it...but slips on the wet
floor...her feet flying out from under...
Sidney reaches out...grabs hold of a sink...saves herself from
falling...she glimpses a GHOST MASK in the mirror coming for her.
A hand grabs her shoulder as she SLAMS her body through the exit
door...narrowly escaping.
CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Sidney flies out of the bathroom door SCREAMING...burning up the
hallway, not looking back.
A TEACHER, hearing her SCREAM, peer
out from an open doorway...as Sidney sprints by him, not
stopping...running madly.
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
CLOSE on a red-faced Principal Himbry as he reads someone the riot
act.
MR. HIMBRY
I'm sickened. Your whole havoc-inducing,
thieving, whoring generation disgusts me.
The CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to reveal two GHOST MASKED STUDENTS
standing at attention.
Mr. Himbry rips the mask off of one of the
student's heads.
MR. HIMBRY
Two students have been savagely murdered.
And this is how we express our compassion
and sensivity?
He rips the mask off the other student.
MR. HIMBRY
We throw on a mask and dance around
campus just hoping someone else gets
butchered before we get bored again.
You're both expelled.
The GHOSTS doth protest...
GHOST #1
Aw, come on, Mr. Himbry, it was just a
joke.
GHOST #2
Yeah, that's not fair.
A deep rooted hostility has taken over Mr. Himbry's face.
Neither
student budges, scared to even breathe.
MR. HIMBRY
No, it's not fair. Fairness would be to
rip your insides out and hang you from
a tree so you can be exposed for the
desensitized, heartless little shits that
you are.
Suddenly the door BURSTS open and Sidney appears, hysterical.
SIDNEY
(crying)
He's here...I saw him...he's here...
Mr. Himbry rushes to her, arms outstretched.
MR. HIMBRY
Easy child.
Sidney collapses in his arms.
SCHOOL CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER
School is clearing out.
The halls have begun to empty as Tatum
escorts Sidney down the hallway.
TATUM
It was just some sick fuck having a
laugh.
SIDNEY
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
Tatum wants to believe her but...
TATUM
You are not to be alone again. Is that
clear? If you pee--I pee.
Stu appears.
STU
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid,
what happened?
TATUM
For once, Stu, drop it.
STU
Okay, but whatever you did--the entire
student body thanks you.
Stu moves to Tatum and gives her a kiss.
STU
And to celebrate this impromptu fall
break, I propose we have a party.
Tonight, my house.
SIDNEY
Are you serious?
STU
My parents are out of town. It'll be
like my hurricane bash last year.
Nothing extreme. Just a few of us,
hangin'.
Tatum warms to the idea.
TATUM
This could be good. What do you think,
Sid?
SIDNEY
I don't know...
TATUM
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
Sidney considers trying hard to be good spirited.
STU
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
SIDNEY
(giving in)
Yeah, okay...whatever.
STU
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
Stu speeds off, sliding down the empty hallway.
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER
Mr. Himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before
him.
He picks one of them up, snickering.
MR. HIMBRY
Damn...
He stands and moves to the closet next to his office door.
He
pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door.
He tries
the mask on, pulling it over his face, looking in the mirror
when...
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR stops him.
He rips the mask off his head,
turns to his office door and opens it to reveal...
AN EMPTY DOORWAY.
He pokes his head into the outer office area
and looks around.
But no one's there.
MR. HIMBRY
Yes? Hello?
The place is empty.
A little suspicious he closes the door,
catching his reflection in the closet mirror.
He looks at the
mask in his hands.
Jesus, even he's jumpy.
Two seconds later...
ANOTHER KNOCK AT THE DOOR.
Himbry grabs the door quickly, this
time throwing it open.
Again no one's there.
He steps out into
the outer office determined to catch a prankster.
OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Completely empty.
Mr. Himbry moves through the outer office and
into the school corridor.
The overhead lights have been turned
off and the corridor is now dark and deserted.
He looks up and
down the hall.
Only a JANITOR is seen in the distance pushing a
broom.
MR. HIMBRY
Little shits.
Mr. Himbry returns to his office.
OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Himbry reenters his office, moving to his desk, when he spots the
closet door NOW CLOSED SHUT.
This gives him a pause-he had left it open.
Hadn't he?
Suddenly,
he can't remember.
He shifts uneasy, reaching for the door knob,
pulling the door open to reveal...
AN EMPTY CLOSET.
He stands still a moment, suddenly realizing
someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door.
Nervously, he pushes it shut to reveal...
NOTHING.
Himbry shakes away his jitters, realizing he's spooked
himself.
He continues to his desk, pushing his office door shut
when...
A GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges from behind it...knife in hand.
Quick and easy.
Three quick jabs to the stomach and Himbry goes
down.
The GHOST MASKED FIGURE towering above him.
BLOCKBUSTER - CONTINUOUS
You typical Blockbuster--huge and crowded.
Randy, in his
Blockbuster get up, is busy reshelving returns when Stu appears--
knocking the videos out of his hand.
STU
Jesus, this place is packed.
RANDY
(picking up videos)
We had a run in the mass murder section.
STU
You coming tonight?
RANDY
Yeah, I'm off early--curfew you know.
(looking off)
Now that's poor taste.
STU
What?
Randy refers to Billy who stands down the aisle talking to TWO
GIRLS.
(The twits from the bathroom perhaps.)
RANDY
If you were the only suspect in a
senseless bloodbath would you be standing
in the horror section?
STU
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't
do anything.
RANDY
You're such a little lap dog. He's got
killer printed all over his forehead.
STU
The why'd the police let him go?
RANDY
Because, obviously they don't watch
enough movies. This is standard horror
movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
Randy moves down the aisle, reshelving videos.
STU
Why would he want to kill his own
girlfriend?
RANDY
There's always some stupid bullshit
reason to kill your girlfriend. That's
the beauty of it all. Simplicity.
Besides, if it's too complicated you lose
your target audience.
STU
So what's his reason?
RANDY
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
STU
She's saving herself for you.
RANDY
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to
mutilate her, you think Sid would go out
with me?
STU
I think her father did it. How come they
can't find his ass?
RANDY
Because he's probably dead. His body
will come popping out in the last reel
somewhere...eyes gauged. See, the police
are always off track with this shit, if they'd
watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time.
There's formula to it. A very simple one.
Everyone's always a suspect--the father,
the principal, the town derelict...
STU
Which is you...
RANDY
So while they're off investigating a dead
end, Billy, who's been written off as a
suspect, is busy planning his next
hunting expedition.
BILLY
(o.c.)
How do we know you're not the killer?
Randy spins around to find Billy right behind him.
Busted.
RANDY
Uh...hi, Billy.
BILLY
Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost it's
reality button?
Randy shrugs, laughing it off.
RANDY
You're absolutely right. I'm the first
to admit it. If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.
STU
And what would be your motive?
RANDY
It's 1995--motives are incidental.
PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS
Dewey's behind the wheel having a heated conversation with Tatum
while Sid stares out the window.
DEWEY
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
TATUM
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a
little blow out--we'll be perfectly safe.
Sid stares out the window. CLOSED SIGNS fill the storefronts, a
few people rush to their car, in a hurry to beat curfew.
SIDNEY
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN
THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
DEWEY
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout
some killer in Texas.
TATUM
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a
movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
SIDNEY
Oh, god...
Dewey comes to a stop, parking the car in front of the police
station. He looks to Sid with a brotherly smile.
DEWEY
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
SIDNEY
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd
cast Tori Spelling.
SUPERMARKET - FEW MINUTES LATER
Sidney and Tatum push a basket through the junk food section.
The
store is completely empty.
The girls gab freely.
SIDNEY
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I
just can't relax.
TATUM
You have a few intimacy issues as a
result of your mother's untimely death.
It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
SIDNEY
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum.
You know, with all the sex stuff. How
many guys would put up with a girlfriend
who's sexually anorexic?
TATUM
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
Sidney grabs some chips and salsa from the shelf.
Down the aisle,
through the storefront window the GHOST MASKED FIGURE still stands
watching their every move.
LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
A big room with KIDS sprinkled throughout-smoking, drinking,
cutting up.
A stereo BLASTS music while the TV airs around the
clock killer coverage.
Tatum and Sid enter with groceries.
Various FRIENDS greet them.
TATUM
Caterer's here.
The girls carry bags through a hallway that opens up onto an
enormous kitchen.
Stu and some GUYS are leaning over the sink
drinking beer through a funnel.
TATUM
That's mature.
STU
Where you guys been? We had to start
without you.
NEWSVAN
Kenny and Gale move around inside the van.
Kenny hovers over a
control panel complete with video monitors.
KENNY
What's the plan?
GALE
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a
window and tape all of tonight's
festivities.
Kenny picks up a compact video camera the size of his fist.
He
checks its battery pack.
KENNY
The control board's glitched. You know
we can't carry a live picture.
GALE
What's the delay?
KENNY
About thirty seconds.
GALE
As long as it records I don't give a
shit. We're not doing a remote.
Gale slides open the side door and steps out into the darkness,
not seeing the FIGURE that stands behind her.
A hand grabs her
shoulder, Gale's heart stops as she spins around to find...
Dewey, smiling, extremely pleased to see her.
DEWEY
Evening, ma'am.
GALE
Deputy...good evening.
DEWEY
What brings you out to these parts?
GALE
You never know when or where a story will
break.
DEWEY
Not much story here. Just a bunch of
kids cutting loose.
GALE
Then what are you doing here?
DEWEY
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the
place out.
GALE
Mind if I join you?
Dewey considers for a whole two seconds.
DEWEY
Not at all.
Gale leans in the van, grabs the camera from
Kenny's hand, and
throws it in her bag.
She gives Kenny a wink.
KITCHEN
CLOSE ON a microwave.
Popcorn POPS inside.
CAMERA WIDENS TO
REVEAL...
Sid, Stu, and Tatum moving about the kitchen, preparing a junk
food feast.
Other TEENS pop in and out. Randy appears amongst
them.
He carries an armful of videos.
RANDY
I thought we'd make it a BLOCKBUSTER
night.
He lets the videos splatter across the kitchen counter.
Stu and
Tatum dive in.
STU
I thought everything was checked out.
RANDY
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
Sidney peruses the videos.
SIDNEY
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT
--How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these
movies?
RANDY
She's the Scream Queen.
STU
With that set of lungs--she should be.
TATUM
(to Sid)
Tits--see.
LIVING ROOM - FEW MINUTES LATER
The party is going strong.
Ten maybe fifteen people stand, sit,
lean.
Some crowd around the floor in front of the television.
Randy is taking a vote.
RANDY
How many EVIL DEAD'S?
(hands go up)
How many HELLRAISER'S?
Hands go up.
BICKERING AD-LIB, etc.
The doorbell RINGS.
Stu goes for it.
STU
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're
in the fridge in the garage.
TATUM
What am I? The beer wench?
STU
(o.c.)
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick
from INSIDE STORY?
They look up the hallway to see Dewey and Gale standing in the
foyer.
TATUM
Shit, Dewey!
Everyone perks up, eyeing Gale.
TATUM
What is she doing here?
DEWEY
She's with me. I just wanted to check on
things.
The GUYS in the room are drooling over Gale.
Including Stu.
TATUM
So you did--now leave...and take your
media muff with you.
Tatum takes off for the kitchen.
Gale has quickly become the focus of the party.
All eyes are on
her.
SOME TEEN
I watch your show regularly.
STU
This must be big news to be on INSIDE
STORY.
GALE
Huge.
ANOTHER TEEN
Wanna interview us?
RANDY
We could be like two grief stricken
students and we'll say really nice things
about our good friends who were
slaughtered senselessly.
STU
I can cry on cue.
Gale eyes the bookshelf above the television.
GALE
Maybe later?
Suddenly, Gale starts to COUGH.
GALE
Can I trouble you for some water?
STU
How 'bout a beer? Randy--get the lady a
beer.
RANDY
You get it.
Gale slips the camera from her bag--hits the ON switch and holds
it behind her...waiting for the right moment.
BACK IN FOYER
SIDNEY
Have they found my father?
DEWEY
Afraid not.
SIDNEY
Should I be worried?
DEWEY
Not yet.
KITCHEN
Tatum is alone in the kitchen.
She empties popcorn into a bowl,
then pulls open the refrigerator...looks quickly, then
remembers...
She moves through the adjoining laundry room to the...
GARAGE
The kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage.
Tatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch.
She finds a button and hits it.
BRRRRMMM!
The electric garage
door starts to rise.
Wrong switch.
She hits it again and it
closes.
She finds another switch.
CLICK.
A small lightbulb overhead
comes on, barely lighting the large two car garage, leaving
pockets of shadows along the wall.
Tatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it,
not seeing the kitchen door, quietly, slowly, closing behind her,
sealing her off from the rest of the house.
Tatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open.
Its light
casts a glow across her face.
CRASH-BOOM!
Tatum jumps, spinning around just in time to see a cat escape
through a large pet door that's built into the garage door.
She
smiles at her jumpiness.
Tatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads
back to the kitchen.
At the kitchen door, she juggles the beer, reaching for the knob.
It's locked.
TATUM
SHIT!
She KICKS it with her foot several times.
TATUM
Hey, Shitheads!
A moment.
No answer.
TATUM
OH, SHIT PISS!
Tatum leans over and, with her elbow, hits the garage door button.
BRRRMM!
It begins to rise.
She moves towards the rising door, beer in hand.
Suddenly, CRR-
BRRRM!
The garage door RESETS, reversing direction, moving down,
closing.
TATUM
What the...
Tatum spins around to see..
A GHOST MASKED FIGURE
Silhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the
switch.
Tatum at once GASPS, taken back, but then relaxes.
TATUM
Is that you, Randy? Cute.
The FIGURE stares at her, blankly.
TATUM
And what movie is this from? I SPIT ON
YOUR GARAGE.
Tatum takes a step towards the FIGURE.
TATUM
Lose the mask. If Sidney sees it, she'll
flip.
The FIGURE shakes his head slowly from side to side.
TATUM
Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?
The FIGURE slowly nods.
TATUM
Can I be the helpless victim?
The FIGURE slowly nods again.
TATUM
Okay, let's see. "No, please don't kill
me, Mr. Ghostface. I want to be in the
sequel."
Tatum takes a step to move around the FIGURE, but he steps too,
blocking her.
TATUM
Cut, Casper. That's a wrap.
Tatum moves again, sidestepping the FIGURE, but he's faster and
cuts her off.
Tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with
the other pushes the FIGURE hard, knocking him aside.
TATUM
Randy--will you stop?
But as the FIGURE intercepts, lunging forward, grabbing her wrist
hard, Tatum stumbles...beer cans hit the floor, spewing...
TATUM
You little shit.
Tatum yanks hard, releasing his hold when a flash of silver
catches her eye.
She looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as
it darts forward, cutting into her forearm...
Tatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious.
The FIGURE advances on her--knife out, ready.
She staggers
backwards, holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator,
SCREAMING.
TATUM
Who are you?
The FIGURE lashes out with the knife.
Tatum dodges it, leaping
back against the fridge.
The FIGURE advances.
Instinctively, she
rips the top freezer door open, BASHING the FIGURE in the face,
sending him backwards, reeling.
Tatum bolts to the...CLOSED GARAGE DOOR.
In a panic, she BEATS
and PULLS
on it, trying to make it lift.
She eyes the FIGURE...he's
recovering...
She goes for the pet door, dropping to the floor, diving for
it...she wedges her upper body through, her head, shoulders, torso
just as the...
FIGURE pounces, grabbing hold of her feet.
Tatum goes crazy
SCREAMING and KICKING trying to get through.
FOYER - MINUTES LATER
It's getting late and SOME KIDS leave through the front door,
muttering, "parents and curfew", etc.
The door hangs open wide.
Sid moves to close it when....
BILLY appears in a classic fake scare.
SIDNEY
Billy? Jesus, you scared me.
Stu appears.
STU
(with a wink)
Dude. What are you doing here?
BILLY
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
SIDNEY
If Tatum sees you--she'll draw blood.
STU
You guys can go up to my parents room?
To talk and...whatever.
BILLY
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
SIDNEY
It's okay. We need to talk.
Sid grabs his hand and leads him up the staircase.
Randy appears
from the kitchen just in time to see Sid and Billy disappear
upstairs.
RANDY
What's Leatherface doing here?
STU
He came to make up.
RANDY
There goes my chance with Sid.
STU
Like you had one.
NEWSVAN
Kenny fidgets at the control board.
He hits a coupla buttons,
bangs the side of the monitor and a picture emerges...the living
room.
The camera is positioned just above the television...
ON SCREEN
The party is in full swing.
Several TEENS sit right in front of
the television.
Because of the camera's position they appear to
be staring right into the lens.
Suddenly, the van's side door slides open and Gale pops in.
KENNY
Got a picture. Perfect placement. We
can see everything.
Gale is ecstatic.
GALE
Tell me, Kenny, has a cheesy tabloid
journalist ever won the Pulitzer?
BEDROOM
A large, master bedroom with glass doors that lead out onto a
balcony.
Sid and Billy stare at each other for a long moment.
Awkward.
SIDNEY
So...
BILLY
So...I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit
and I'm sorry.
SIDNEY
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been
selfish and self-absorbed with all of my
post traumatic stress.
BILLY
You lost your mom...
SIDNEY
But you're right--enough is enough. I
can't wallow in the grief process forever
and I can't keep lying to myself about
who my mom was.
Billy bows his head quietly, knowingly.
SIDNEY
I think in some weird analytical,
psychological bullshit way I'm scared
I'm gonna turn out just like her, you
know? Like the bad seed or something...
BILLY
Oh Sidney...
SIDNEY
Everytime I get close to you I see my
mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
BILLY
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she
kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
SIDNEY
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
BILLY
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's
one great big movie. Only you can't
pick your genre.
Billy moves to her.
They embrace, tenderly.
SIDNEY
I wanna let go. I do...
BILLY
Ssshh...everything's gonna be okay. I
promise.
Sidney takes the initiative, acting on impulse, kissing him long
and hard.
She breaks away passionately, out of breath.
SIDNEY
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?
Billy nibbles her neck.
BILLY
Sshh..it's okay.
SIDNEY
Or even a good porno.
BILLY
(shocked)
What?
She stares at him, her eyes sexually charged.
SIDNEY
You heard me.
BILLY
(incredulous)
Are you serious?
SIDNEY
(surprising herself)
Yeah...I think so.
They smile at each other.
LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
The camera sits on the book shelf lodged between two knickknacks,
completely inconspicuous. The CAMERA WIDENS to reveal several
TEENS watching the TV--the horror diehards.
TEEN #1
Look, here it comes. SPLAT!
TEEN #2
The blood's not the right color. Why do
they do that? It's too red.
RANDY
Here comes another...
TEEN #3
Predictable. Knew he was going to bite
it.
BORED TEEN
How can you watch this shit over and
over?
RANDY
Shhhhh.
STU
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do
we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
RANDY
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie
Lee was always the virgin in horror movies.
She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
BOY TEEN
No way.
RANDY
That's why she always lived. Only
virgins can outsmart the killer in the
big chase scene in the end. Don't you
know the rules?
Stu finishes his beer.
STU
What rules?
Randy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of
the television, explaining.
RANDY
There are certain rules that one must
abide by in order to successfully survive
a horror movie. For instance: 1. You
can never have sex. The minute you get a
little nookie--you're as good as gone.
Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink
or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an
extension of number one. And 3. Never,
ever, ever, under any circumstances, say
"I'll be right back."
STU
Wanna another beer?
RANDY
Yeah.
STU
I'll be right back.
Everybody "ooohhs".
RANDY
There he goes folks--a dead man. Wave
bye-bye.
NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS
Gale and Kenny watch the monitor.
The party is clearing out some
A RAP at the van door.
Gale pulls it open to see Deputy Riley
standing, his face all smiles.
DEWEY
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check
out a possible lead. Thought you might
like to join me.
GALE
What kind of lead?
DEWEY
A car was spotted in the bushes a little
ways up the road.
GALE
I'd love to. If you're sure it's
alright?
DEWEY
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
GALE
Can I bring Kenny?
DEWEY
(too quickly)
NO! I mean...I should probably take just
you.
Gale steps out of the van turning back to Kenny.
GALE
I'll be back.
She slides the van door closed.
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
SCARY MUSIC fills the room.
The party is reduced to the diehards
in front of the television.
RANDY
(pointing to TV)
Look, here comes the obligatory tit shot.
OTHER GUYS
Beautiful! Finally!
BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Billy and Sidney are going at it...passionately.
He has his head
buried in her neck.
SIDNEY
(to herself)
"Eight is enough to fill our lives with
love..."
It's working.
Sidney pushes Billy off her as she pulls her shirt
over her head.
She fumbles with the clasp of her bra as the...
CAMERA RUSHES IN on her breasts.
Just as Sid's bra straps slide
of her shoulders...
Billy moves in front of the CAMERA, pulling his jeans off,
Blocking Sidney from view.
LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER
Back in the living room, the horror fest continues when the phone
RINGS.
Everyone ignores it.
It RINGS again.
Finally, Randy grabs the receiver from the side table.
RANDY
Hello? Yeah....HOLY SHIT.
Randy, freaked, drops the phone, finds the TV remote and pauses
the movie, the others protest
"Hey, Put is back..." etc.
RANDY
Listen up. They found Principal Himbry
dead. He was gutted and hung from the
goal post on the football field.
This stills the room.
Complete silence as the news sinks in.
ON
different faces...a moment of devastation..disbelief.
And then:
TEEN #1
So what are we waiting for?
TEEN #2
Let's get over there before they pry him
down.
And in seconds the room is empty as everyone bolts for the
door..HOOTIN' and HOLLERIN' ...leaving Randy, near drunk, alone in
the living room.
He returns to the movie.
RANDY
We were just getting to the good part.
NEWSVAN - MINUTES LATER
Kenny is barely watching the monitor, he reached boredom some time
ago.
He finds a bag of Cheetos and chows down when he hears
SCREAMING from outside.
He peers out the window to see the last
of the PARTY KIDS pile into two cars and race off down the road.
He chews a Cheeto slowly, his interest piqued.
BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
The sex is over...and both Sid and Billy are dressing
respectively.
That post-sex awkwardness.
Sid brushes out her hair as her eyes come to rest on the telephone
on the nightstand...it puzzles her as a stark reveleation crosses
her face.
She turns to Billy who sits on the floor, putting on
his shoes.
SIDNEY
Who did you call?
BILLY
What?
SIDNEY
When you're arrested-you're allowed one
phone call? Who did you call?
BILLY
I called my dad.
SIDNEY
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw
him.
BILLY
Yeah...and when I called no one answered.
SIDNEY
Uh-huh.
BILLY
You don't still think it was me?
SIDNEY
No, but if it were you, that would have
been a very clever way to throw me off
track. Using your one phone call to call
me so I wouldn't think it was you.
Billy stands up.
BILLY
What do I have to do to prove to you I'm
not a killer?
He makes a move toward her when..from behind, in a split instant,
from the open balcony doors comes...
THE GHOST FIGURE
Sidney sees the FIGURE immedietely, SCREAMING.
Billy tries to
calm her, oblivious to the advancing GHOST.
SIDNEY
BILLYWATCHOUT!!!!
Billy barely turns as a long steely blade rises high in the air.
It strikes down with force...hitting his chest as blood sprays the
air.
ON SIDNEY as red crimson splatters across her face...as the knife
is thrust in and out of Billy who tries hard to put up a
fight..but it's useless...he never had a chance.
His body falls
to the floor..lifeless.
ANGLE ON GHOST
as he watches Billy's body come to a still before quietly, calmly
turning his attention to...
SIDNEY who stands, numb...scared to death.
And only when the
GHOST takes a step forward does Sidney break.
She takes off like
a rocket...leaping over the bed and out the door.
HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Sidney tears out the door and down the hall, coated in Billy's
blood.
ANGLE ON THE GHOST
as he catches up with her, grabbing hold of her collar.
She pulls
away from him...her shirt ripping down the back.
Her hands find a door knob and she goes for it, pulling the door
open...moving quickly inside...locking it behind her.
DARK SPACE - CONTINUOUS
Total darkness.
Sidney's hands scour the wall for a light switch.
The doorknob turns...the lock holds..as the door is nearly SHAKEN
from it's hinges...and then...
NOTHING.
All goes silent.
Only Sidney's rapid BREATHING fills
the space around her.
Sidney, trembling, shaking, reaches above her, feeling, until she
finds a string.
She pulls it...as a lightbulb SWITCHES on
overhead.
She's in a small box of a room.
The door is on one side, a small,
narrow staircase on the other.
She eyes the doorknob, then the
staircase...contemplating...but it's an easy decision.
There's no
fucking way she's going up to the attic.
She unlocks the door and pushes on it.
But it won't give...she
pushes on it again.
It's locked from the other side.
Shit.
She
turns to the staircase.
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Randy continues to watch TV.
He is now sloppy drunk, completely
involved in the movie on the screen.
SCARY MUSIC SWELLS, filling the room.
RANDY
(to TV)
No, Jamie. Look behind you! Watch out!
Behind you!
And if he followed his own advice, he would see the GHOST MASKED
FIGURE that stands directly behind him...knife poised.
NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS
Kenny finishes off a soda and crushes the can in his hand.
He
tosses it to the floor when a movement from the monitor catches
his eye.
ON THE MONITOR is Randy, still on the couch, engrossed in the
movie.
Directly behind him...the GHOST.
Kenny does a double-
take.
No fucking way.
He watches as the GHOST stands still,
unmoving, knife raised.
KENNY
JESUS...FUCK...
The GHOST takes a silent step forward.
KENNY
(screaming at the monitor)
BEHIND YOU! LOOK BEHIND YOU!
This kid needs help.
Kenny bolts out of his seat and goes for the
side door.
He slides it open and sticks his head out as...
A LONG, SHARP BLADE
comes at Kenny, fast and furious...slicing into his throat.
Kenny
falls forward...out the door as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE is upon
him.
THE CAMERA PANS TO THE MONITOR
just in time to see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE turn away from Randy,
leaving him unharmed, moving instead, out the front door, on a
thirty second walk to the newsvan.
ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
The attic is long and narrow...cluttered with furniture, boxes,
and the likes...moonlight filters in through a small raised window
on the front wall of the house.
Sidney moves through the attic...BUMPING into this, KNOCKING over
that...she passes a dusty mirror, jumping at her own reflection.
She cringes at her image, drenched in Billy's blood.
She stares
long and hard...something about the blood, the redness of it.
She
moves on, determined.
She eyes the raised window above her...a way out...if she could
only reach it...
ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
Sidney has stacked object after object building a ladder to the
window.
She climbs to the top, holding onto the window frame.
She spots Gale almost immedietely.
She SCREAMS OUT, looking for
the window latch.
But there's not one.
It doesn't open.
Sidney
starts beating on it...trying to break it...
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
AN EAR-CURDLING JAMIE LEE CURTIS SCREAM BLASTS through the empty
living room as the horror movie on TV comes to it's horrifying
climax.
Randy is now gone.
ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
Sidney has found an old tennis racket.
She swings a solid
forehand at the window.
THE WINDOW SPRAYS GLASS
Sidney moves quickly, lifting herself up over broken glass and
pulling herself through the window frame.
NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS
Gale is frantic.
She starts the engine up and hits the headlights
when she discovers she can't see out of the windshield.
Gale rubs at the glass.
Sure enough, something is on the
windshield outside, blocking her sight.
Gale hits the wipers as
BLOOD SMEARS across the glass, it drips down from above.
Gale SCREAMS as a HAND reaches in through the open window...she
looks up to see...
RANDY, staring at her madly.
RANDY
What's going on?
A sheer moment of fear as Gale hits the gas plummeting the car
forward, into a ditch.
She hits the BRAKES.
Randy is thrown
forward, away from the van.
Gale reverses, backs up, hits the brakes again...just as Kenny's
face comes sliding down the outside of the windshield...eyes wide,
face distorted, blood everywhere.
Gale hits the gas, and yanks the wheel, sending Kenny's corpse
flying off the top of the van.
Gale spins the van around, onto the road, hits the gas madly,
gaining speed just as...
SIDNEY APPEARS
in the middle of the road, drenched in blood, very much resembling
a young Sissy Spacek.
Gale swerves to miss her, but she turns too sharp and the van
veers off the road at top speed...flipping over on its side,
sliding off into the thick foliage.
JEEP
Sidney hops in, reaches for the ignition...NO KEYS!
Shit.
Just
then, Sidney's eyes go to the front porch.
She watches as the
front door opens and a FIGURE appears in the darkness,
undetectable.
Sidney throws the headlights...illuminating the front side of the
house, revealing...
DEWEY STANDING IN THE DOORWAY.
SIDNEY
DEWEY!
Sidney opens the jeep door, moving to him, noticing his body,
slumped, knees buckled...
And then his body falls forward, slowly, deliberately, hitting the
porch hard.
Standing behind him is...
THE GHOST
SIDNEY SCREAMS FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER SOUL.
SIDNEY
NOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Sid jumps back inside the jeep, closing the door, locking it.
She
reaches over and locks the passenger's door and then she...waits.
And watches as the GHOST leans over Dewey's still body, fumbling
with something.
Then the FIGURE stands upright, in his hands he
holds...
THE KEYS
They jingle in the wind, the GHOST toying with her, enjoying
this...
Sidney, hysterical, locks eyes with the FIGURE as he moves to the
door, Sidney leaps on it, holding the lock button down, making it
impossible to unlock.
Her face is pressed against the
glass...inches from the MASKED FIGURE.
She uses every ounce of strength when suddenly, the GHOST
DISAPPEARS, dropping down, below the window, out of her view.
Sidney moves to the center of the jeep, trying hard to listen over
her own RAPID BREATHING, every sound AMPLIFIED.
Then she hears it, the soft JINGLING of keys near the passengers
side door.
She pounces on the lock, holding it down.
A shadow cuts the beam of the headlights, unseen by Sidney.
The
lock turns on the other side.
Sidney leaps over and holds it
down, securing it.
This is beyond nerve-racking.
Sidney is
certifiable.
Her eyes spot the police radio for the first time.
She grabs the
mouthpiece and hits the switch.
SIDNEY
Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house
on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA
KILL ME!
LIVING ROOM / FOYER
Sid locks and bolts the door.
From the other side she can hear
Randy SCREAMING.
RANDY
NO, SID. OPEN UP. PLEASE...
HE'S GONE CRAZY.
His fists POUND against the door.
Sidney, stumbling in the
darkness, rushes to the phone in the living room.
Just as she
reaches for it...it RINGS.
It scares the life out of her.
She
SCREAMS, yanking it up.
SIDNEY
Please! God! Help me!
VOICE
(from the phone)
Having fun Sidney?
Sidney falls apart, SCREAMING.
SIDNEY
NOOOOOOOOO!!!
She throws the phone down, disconnecting the call.
Sid moves back to the door.
RANDY'S SCREAMS ARE MADDENING.
She
eyes the lock, deliberating.
SIDNEY
(at the door)
GOAWAYLEAVEMEALONE!
CLUNK!
A NOISE UPSTAIRS.
Sidney looks up the staircase, into the darkness, her face SHOCKED
to see...
BILLY
emerging from the shadows, stumbling down the stairs.
Very much
alive.
SIDNEY
Oh God. Billy!
He's blood-soaked and dazed.
Sidney meets him in the landing,
grabbing him, holding him...
SIDNEY
I thought you were...
BILLY
I'm alright. Gotta...get...help.
Billy goes for the door.
SIDNEY
He's out there.
Randy continues POUNDING ON THE DOOR, SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS
LUNGS.
RANDY
(through door)
Please, you gotta let me in. He's
gonna kill me.
Billy goes for the door.
Sidney blocks him.
SIDNEY
NO! Don't believe him.
BILLY
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Sidney hands him the gun.
Billy turns and unlocks the door,
opening it.
Randy rushes in, grabbing Billy, pleading...
RANDY
Help me...
BILLY
(calming him)
Shhhh. It's okay.
RANDY
Stu's flipped out. He's gone mad.
Slowly, a small smile creeps across Billy's face.
BILLY
"We all go a little mad sometimes."
Randy squints, confused, as Billy aims the gun at Randy and pulls
the trigger.
The BLAST throws Randy's body against the wall
before sliding to a heap on the floor...still.
BILLY
Anthony Perkins--PSYCHO
BILLY TURNS TO SIDNEY...
Who stands only feet away, face aghast...
Fuck, no...this can't be happening.
Billy's eyes are on her,
unmoving.
He sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to his
face...tasting it.
BILLY
Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for
pig's blood in CARRIE.
Sidney is dumbfounded.
Slowly, she takes a step back, moving into
the dark refines of the kitchen.
Billy, lurches forward in a fake-out, baiting her.
She takes
another step back--petrified.
CLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE.
It is no longer familiar to Sidney.
There
is something inhuman now about his features.
His expression is
pure evil.
She takes another step back, shrinking into the dark kitchen.
THE CAMERA TAKES A MOMENT TO ADJUST TO THE DARKNESS as the outline
of a FIGURE appears...
STANDING RIGHT BEHIND SIDNEY.
She continues to back up, moving right into the arms of...
STU
Sidney spins around...her mouth open in speechless horror.
SIDNEY
Stu...please...help me...
Stu stares back at her, eyes wide, lips curled in a subtle smile
as he holds a small compact CELLULAR PHONE up to his face.
STU
(whispering into phone)
Surprise, Sidney.
His VOICE sounds affected now...the VOICE of the killer.
Sidney looks back to Billy, then to Stu, then to Billy again.
It
becomes all too clear.
She stands between them, her mind racing, calculating...
SHE BOLTS INTO THE LIVING ROOM
If for no other reason than to put space between her and
them...they stand in the entryway, trapping her in.
BILLY
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've
got one more surprise--Stu, I believe it's
your turn.
STU
Oh yeah
Stu disappears into the kitchen.
BILLY
(to Sidney)
What's wrong? You look like you've seen
a ghost.
Sidney stands, trying hard to hold a calm resolve.
A NOISE comes from the kitchen.
A low dragging sound.
Stu
reappears from the front hall...wrestling with
something...someone...
CLOSE ON STU...he has a body in tow, he thrusts it forward and it
rolls into the living room.
Sidney looks down to find...
HER FATHER
bound and gagged.
His eyes wide in fear, very much alive.
SIDNEY
Daddy!
She starts for him.
BILLY
Close enough.
Stu places the cellular phone in Mr. Prescott's shirt pocket.
STU
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
SIDNEY
Why are you doing this?
STU
It's all part of the game.
BILLY
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
SIDNEY
Fuck you.
BILLY
We already played that game. You lost,
remember?
STU
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to
disappoint your dad. He's been waiting
around all night.
BILLY
It's an easy game. We ask you a
question. If you get it wrong--you die.
STU
And if you get it right--you die.
SIDNEY
You're crazy--both of you.
STU
The official term is "psychotic".
SIDNEY
You'll never get away with this.
BILLY
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't
believe how easy it was to frame him.
STU
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took
a few notes. It was fun.
Billy and Stu relish their madness, proud of themselves.
Sidney looks to her dad, sees the tears in his eyes.
She looks
back to Billy, unflinching..a determined look on her face.
SIDNEY
Why did you kill my mother?
BILLY
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I
think she wants a motive. Hmmm...I don't
really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did
Norman Bates have a motive?
Stu plays along, shaking his head.
STU
Nope.
BILLY
And did they really ever explain why
Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?
Don't think so. You see, it's scarier
when there's no motive, Sid.
SIDNEY
(fighting tears)
I don't understand...
BILLY
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman
was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit
all over town like she was Sharon Stone or
something.
STU
(laughing)
..so we put her out of her misery. I
mean, let's face it, your mom was no
Sharon Stone.
Stu cracks up over this while Billy turns very serious.
BILLY
Is that motive enough for you? Or how
about this? Did you know your slut
mother was sleeping with my dad and she's
the reason my mom moved out and deserted
me.
A sudden silence.
Sidney is rigid with shock, his words resonant
with truth.
SIDNEY
What?
Even Stu is surprised with his seriousness.
BILLY
Think about it. On the off chance I get
caught-a motive like that could divide a
jury for years, don't you think?. You took
my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy
factor. Maternal abandonment causes
serious deviant behavior. It certainly
fucked you up. It made you have sex with
a psychopath.
STU
That's right and now that you're no
longer a virgin. You gotta die--those
are the rules.
Billy sits the gun down on the table near the foyer.
And then
moves to Sidney with the butcher knife in hand.
BILLY
Pretend this is all just a scary movie,
Sid. How do you think it's going to end?
Sidney doesn't respond.
STU
(excited)
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got
it all figured out. Why do you think we
kept your father alive so long? Why did
we save you for last?
BILLY
You know what time it is, Sid? It's
after midnight. It's your mother's
anniversary. We killed her exactly one
year ago today.
Billy turns to Stu with the knife.
They eye each other.
BILLY
Ready?
STU
Yeah...
Billy pulls the knife back and brings it forward quickly, slicing
into Stu.
He stumbles to ho his knees, WINCING in pain.
STU
Jesus...
Sidney SCREAMS...as blood gushes..real blood, a dark, deep red.
Stu inspects the wound to his side...then he smiles...
STU
Good one. My turn.
He takes the knife from Billy.
BILLY
Don't forget-stay to the side and don't
go too deep.
Stu stabs at Billy's belly, puncturing him...Billy doubles over...
BILLY
Jesus...fuck, that hurt.
SIDNEY
Stop it!
BILLY
(squelching the pain)
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's
running out.
STU
Come on, Sid. Think about it. Your
father is the chief suspect. We cloned
his cellular. The evidence is there.
Billy takes the knife and slashes at Stu's arm, two quick
cuts...he doubles over...
BILLY
What if your father snapped? Your mom's
anniversary set him off and he went on a
murder spree, killing everyone...
STU
(in major pain)
Except for me and Billy...we were left
for dead...
BILLY
And then he killed you and then shoots
himself in the head. It's a perfect
ending.
STU
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on
and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these
days--you gotta have a sequel.
Stu takes the knife and cuts at Billy.
SIDNEY
You sick fucks--you've seen one too many
movies.
Billy looks at her, bent over, crazed.
BILLY
Oh Sid, don't blame the movies...Movies
don't create psychos. Movies just make
psychos more creative.
Stu staggers a bit.
STU
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more.
I'm feeling woozy.
BILLY
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
Billy moves to Sidney's father.
STU
Where'd you put it?
Stu is searching the foyer for the gun.
BILLY
It's on the table.
STU
No, it's not.
Billy hobbles over.
The gun is gone.
BILLY
Where the fuck is it?
VOICE
(off camera)
Right here, asshole.
Billy and Stu look up in unison to see...
GALE WEATHERS-CORRESPONDENT FROM INSIDE STORY
standing in the front door way, gun in hand.
Her body tattered
and bloody.
Her hair a mess.
BILLY
I thought she was dead.
STU
She looked dead. Still does.
Gale holds the gun firm, in total control.
GALE
I've got an ending for you. The reporter
left for dead in the newsvan comes to,
stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the
gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day.
Sidney steps forward.
SIDNEY
I like that ending.
Billy lunges at Gale, but she holds steady.
Billy and Stu eye
each other.
BILLY
She can't get both of us.
STU
Odds are--she'll miss anyway.
In a mad rush, they storm Gale, heading straight at her.
She
pulls the trigger, but nothing happens...the safety is on.
Billy charges forward, grabbing hold of the front door, SLAMMING
IT SHUT.
It catches Gale in the face, knocking her backwards out
the door.
She goes down...out.
STU
Cool move.
Billy steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where
Gale lays.
Then he turns back inside the house to find...
SIDNEY GONE.
BILLY
Where'd she go?
Stu looks around, staggering now, bleeding heavily...Sidney has
completely disappeared.
Only her father, bound and gagged remains
in the living.
STU
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
BILLY
Where the fuck did she go?
Suddenly, the phone RINGS.
Billy and Stu look at each other.
Completely surprised.
Billy scrambles over to the phone.
BILLY
(picking up phone)
Hello?
SIDNEY
(from phone)
Are you alone in the house?
Billy looks to Mr. Prescott.
The cellular phone is gone.
BILLY
You bitch--where the fuck are you?
SIDNEY
Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little
game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST
CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED
YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
Billy looks around the living room.
BILLY
Find her.
Billy is fuming now...slightly staggering...and starting to lose
it.
He SCREAMS at Stu who has fallen to his knees.
BILLY
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
STU
I can't...I'm bad off, Billy. You cut
to deep.
Billy throws the phone at Stu.
He mouths to him, so Sid can't
hear.
"Talk to her..."
Then Billy takes off for the kitchen.
Stu takes the phone.
SIDNEY
(aware)
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got
one. The police are on their way. What
are you going to tell them?
STU
Peer pressure...I'm way to sensitive.
Billy flies back in the room, grabbing the phone from Stu.
He's
completely nuts now, staggering, bleeding, totally insane.
BILLY
(SCREAMING in phone)
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like
your slut whore mother.
SIDNEY
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed
Mama's boy.
Billy starts ripping the room up, overturning furniture in a mad
fit of rage...when he notices the hall closet.
Touche!
He smiles
deliriously, heading for it, ripping it open as...
A GHOST MASKED FIGURE strikes from within, with an umbrella, the
sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out.
Billy stumbles
back, stunned, as the GHOST comes at him again...the umbrella
lodges in his chest, and he goes down.
Sidney rips the GHOST MASK off her head.
She looks at Billy,
disgusted, throwing the mask on Billy's now still body.
A
movement behind her sends her reeling around to find...
RANDY slowly sitting up.
His body drenched in blood.
He's
alive...barely.
He looks to Sidney...through pain...
RANDY
You know what I hate most about horror
movies? The final scene...it just goes on
and on...and it gets so stupid...
Randy manages to stand when a FIGURE COMES LEAPING at him,
completely unexpected...it's Stu...barreling into him...they fall
back into the living room.
Sidney grabs the gun next to Billy and
turns to the living room to find...
Randy and Stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock, fighting,
both seriously injured...Sid tries to find aim when a...
HAND GRABS HOLD of Sidney's ankle, toppling her to the
floor...once again she finds Billy on top of her...
IN THE LIVING ROOM
Randy and Stu pound at each other, beating and clawing...
ON SIDNEY as she fights viciously, attacking with everything she's
got...
Randy is desperately trying to pry away from Stu...he grabs hold
of the television set and tries to pull himself off the floor out
of Stu's clutch...
His hands find the top of the TV...the VCR...he yanks on it,
gripping it with his hands, bringing it around with force-CRASHING
the VCR into Stu's head.
Stu drops.
ON SIDNEY as she digs her hand into Billy's open chest wound.
He
CRIES OUT BLOODY MURDER.
Her other hand brings the gun up to his
face...but he head bunts it out the front door...suddenly a flash
of silver appears above Sidney.
Billy has grasped the butcher knife...he rises it high above
Sidney ready to strike...when a bullet RIPS THROUGH THE FOYER
striking Billy knocking him back into the living room.
Sidney looks up to see...
GALE WEATHERS, holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises
above the gun's chamber.
Sidney sits up as Gale moves to her, helping her.
Their eyes
meet.
A life truce.
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Billy and Stu lay face up, head to head.
Sid and Gale move over
them, staring down.
Randy joins them.
RANDY
Sid, you found me out...I'm a virgin.
And pretty happy about it right now.
Sidney nudges their bodies.
They both stir.
RANDY
Careful. This is the moment when you
think the killer's dead, but then he
springs back to life for one last scare.
Sidney grabs the gun from Gale.
SIDNEY
Not this time.
She positions her foot on Stu's chest and aims.
SIDNEY
This is for my Mom, asshole.
She SHOOTS him in the forehead, a clean and perfect shot.
The she
aims the barrel at Billy who's eyes suddenly open, blinking up at
her, blood bubbling from his lips.
He's not yet dead.
Their eyes
lock.
SIDNEY
And this Billy stud-bucket is for having
an incredibly small weenie.
She FIRES another perfect shot.
They're both goners.
Sidney drops the smoking gun, standing silent over the bodies.
A
quiet moment when suddenly...
A FIGURE LUNGES AT THEM
Both Sid and Gale and Randy SCREAM in epic, final scare
proportions as Mr. Prescott leaps forward, still bound and gagged.
Sid catches her breath, relaxing.
SIDNEY
Oh Daddy...
She rushes to him, untying him...while Gale moves to the bookcase
and retrieves the hidden camera.
GALE
I wanna close-up.
Randy appears by Sidney's side, helping her untie her father.
RANDY
This is probably an inappropriate
moment, but you think you'd want
to maybe go out with me sometime...
like on a date?
Sidney looks at him, dumbfounded.
RANDY
Maybe catch a movie?
A long moment as Sidney's face goes from disbelief to resignation
to the slight trace of a smile.
SIDNEY
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
RANDY
You got it.
He smiles at her...watching as Sidney grabs hold of her father,
holding him tight as Gale Weathers, with camera in hand, gets one
hell of an ending to this SCARY MOVIE.
