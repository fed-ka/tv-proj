teven's loft is in an old squat building on 47th Street near
Twelfth Avenue. The structure looks abandoned. Graffiti
everywhere. Entranceway filled with debris.

LONE EAGLE (V.O.)
Another day of traffic. Traffic
everywhere I look. Cars stop and
move and stop again. People sit at
the wheel thinking their thoughts.

The shimmering glass facade of the United Nations Plaza
Apartments at 48th Street and First Avenue. A man visible at
a window on one of the high floors, a cup of coffee in his
hand.
LONE EAGLE (V.O.)
Day in, day out. Red light, green
light. Traffic on the major
arteries and traffic in the little
veins.
From his POV we see the traffic below creeping along, nearly
at a standstill.
LONE EAGLE (V.O.)
Cars, vans, taxis, trucks, limos,
Mopeds, bikes and buses. Emergency
vehicles screaming and wailing.
Birth and death, walk and don't
walk.
The man takes a sip of coffee.
LONE EAGLE (V.O.)
Traffic yesterday, today and
tomorrow. Bumper to bumper, soul to
soul. This is Lone Eagle over and
out.

The same man -- the playwright Nicky Rogan with his hand in
the air, hailing a cab. He is forty-five, vigorous, wearing
well-made sporty clothes.

47th Street and Third Avenue. A man is dancing with a life-
size cloth doll. His tape player is on the sidewalk, playing
and instrumental version of "Beautiful Dreamer" and there is
a cigar box for donations. A few people look on from a
distance. The man wearing an old cutaway, with running shoes,
and the doll has long red tresses and wears a frilly gown.
Nicky emerges from a taxi at the corner and walks rapidly
past the dancing man.
Nicky crosses the courtyard to Buchanan Apartments.

Nicky stands alongside the first taxi and pays his original

Bank towers. The Bank of India, Banco di Napoli, Bear
Stearns, the Bank of New York, The Chemical Bank,
Manufacturers Hanover. A sense of real institutions looming
over the busy street. The bank names engraved on bronze
markers, carved in granite, incised on glass.
Street level. A glimpse of the bronze statue called "Taxi on
Park Avenue" -- a man with and attache case and raincoat,
hailing a cab. The real people hailing cabs, well-dressed men
and women striding along with briefcases -- purposeful,
successful.

A whitish brown mist is building the west. There is a sense
of scurrying people.

The driver flees eastward. Nicky and Elliot run across
Madison Avenue. A snowstorm of asbestos is shooting out of a
man hole cover west of Fifth Avenue, reducing visibility to
near zero. Cars and people are white shadows.
The two men, with collars raised and hands over heads hurry
into a restaurant on 47th Street between Madison and Fifth.

The asbestos mist still clings. Men in protective suits and
masks move slowly, like moon walkers. Halted traffic,
abandoned cars. Mud covering the sidewalks and shop windows.
A gauzy stillness, dreamlike.

The parking lot is empty. The stands are empty. A few members
of the crew move the batting cage into place for batting
practice.

The street is deserted. Nicky holds the newspaper over his
face for protection. Each man has an arm in the air, trying
to hail a taxi. They are standing near a trash receptacle
that carries an advertisement for "New York Magazine". It is
a reproduction of the cover that we'd glimpsed earlier in
Joanna's apartment when her maid was reading the magazine. A
furtive man shielding his face with the newspaper -- and a
headline about a Phantom. Nicky and Elliot do not see the
receptacle.
A bus comes down the street with a large horizontal ad
covering its right side. It is the same ad -- five of them
actually, five "New York Magazine" covers side by side.
Elliot is trying to hail a cab and doesn't notice the ad. As
the bus bears down, Nicky steps out of the way, removing the
newspaper from his face and getting a clear look at the five
photos on the side of the bus -- a man concealing his face
with a newspaper.
Nicky reads the text under the logo of "New York Magazine".

Nicky stares after the bus. Another bus comes along, carrying
the same ad.
Nicky watches darkly.

About a dozen people gathered together including several
diamond merchants in their beards, black suits and fur hats.
They are watching the man in the cutaway dancing with his
cloth doll. Someone places a donation in the cigar box. From
the tape player: "Dancing in the Dark."
Elliot ends up near the Gotham Book Mart, on the north side
of the street. Nicky looks right past him into the bookstore
window. He sees something that interests him.
ELLIOT
Where are you going?

NICKY
Don't wait Efor me.
ELLIOT
What about the haircut?

Elliot looks up and sees Paisley emerging from Steven's

Nicky walking slowly backwards, arm raised, trying to hail a
cab. It is getting dark. He glances left, sees a large two-
panel poster in front of the theater. One half is a black-and-
white photo -- a younger Nicky Rogan, in a tuxedo, holding an
award in his raised hand.
The other half is all type --

He sees someone enter the theater lobby. It is his daughter
Laurel. He follows, catching up to her at the end of a short
line of people at the ticket window.
NICKY
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I
double-checked.

LAUREL
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one.
Mother's not going.
NICKY
Opening night?
LAUREL
I know -- why should a bitter
divorce interfere with tradition?
Laurel reaches the window and speaks to the clerk.
LAUREL
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a
Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it.
Sell it.
NICKY
Take it yourself. Take a date.
AUREL
I don't have a date. I don't want a
date.
They leave the window with Laurel's ticket.
NICKY
And you blame me. It's because we
never talk. Let's talk.
LAUREL
I have a class. I'm late.
NICKY
Can we talk later? Will you be at
the party?
LAUREL
I'm not sure.
She is out the door, hurrying across the street. Nicky stands
under the marquee, calling out to her.
NICKY
I'll find you. After the show.
Somewhere.

It is dark and cold. Nicky emerges and walks west, diagonally
across the street, to a barbershop on the other side of Ninth
Avenue.
lliot is on the stoop waiting for him.
Crowds of people pouring down the ramps from the train
station, hurrying, late.
The umpire's room -- six men nibbling cookies, smoking a last-
minute cigarette, adjusting equipment.
An unidentified room somewhere in there lower reaches of the
stadium. Twenty cases of Great Western champagne stacked and
ready for the postgame celebration.

Morning."

A yellow taxi comes speeding past, moving eastward on 48th
Street. We see it from various perspectives and elevations.
It is a large checkered cab, the only thing moving in the
night. Steam comes billowing from funnel vents. The taxi
catches every light just before it turns red.

The taxi crosses Park Avenue, speeding past the bronze statue
of a man hailing a cab.
It approaches First Avenue, where a road divider bisects the
thoroughfare. Nicky swings into a sharp turns, barely
averting contact with the divider, and stops abruptly.
Three doors open. On the empty street, Nicky hands the driver
a wad of bills. Then he and Laurel step over the divider. He
puts his arm around her shoulders and they cross the avenue
to the glass tower where they live.
The sun begins to climb out of the East River.
