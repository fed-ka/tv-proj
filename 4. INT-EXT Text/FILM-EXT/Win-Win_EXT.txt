It's a bitter cold January morning. The woods are quiet.
Desolate. In the far off distance a man is jogging. He banks
around the end of a small pond and runs right at us. This is
MIKE FLAHERTY, FORTY-TWO. He is running hard. Or at least as
hard as he can.
Suddenly TWO JOGGERS blow past him.
Mike walks outside toward his car. He opens the car door.
JACKIE
Mike?
Mike turns. Jackie is standing at the door.
JACKIE (CONT'D)
Did you call Fenn about the tree?
PAUL
No. I will today.
JACKIE
Please do. I don't want it coming
down on the house.
Mike looks at a VERY DEAD TREE in the side yard.
MIKE
Yeah. You're right. I will.
JACKIE
Mike?
MIKE
Yeah?
JACKIE
I love you.
MIKE
I love you too, sweetie. Bye.
Jackie shuts the door. Mike looks up at the tree.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Shit.
Mike's car pulls into a driveway of an OLD HOUSE that has
been converted into TWO OFFICES.
A SIGN on the lawn reads: "MICHAEL S. FLAHERTY, COUNSELOR AT
LAW" and "STEPHEN VIGMAN, CPA"
Mike parks his car as a WORKMAN walks up from the basement of
the house and gets into his VAN and pulls away.
Mike gets out of his car and walks toward the back door
carrying his briefcase. He stops at the basement steps.
MIKE
Vig?
VOICE
Down here.
Mike walks down the stairs.
Mike and TERRY DELFINO are running. Terry is the same age as
Mike but dressed in a better gear. They are both breathing
hard.
TERRY
How's the team doing?
MIKE
Not good.
TERRY
What the hell happened? We used to
be good.
MIKE
Yeah, well we're not anymore.

CONTINUED:
TERRY
Can we walk for a bit?
MIKE
Yeah.
They both stop. Terry is completely winded.
TERRY
That sucked. You're running good,
buddy. Kicking my ass.
Terry's blackberry beeps. He takes it out and reads it.
MIKE
Yeah. I've been getting out here a
bit more often.
TERRY
You gotta be kidding me.
MIKE
What?
TERRY
Lori's texting me at seven in the
morning to ask me if I want an
antique sewing table that we bought
together.
MIKE
Do you?
TERRY
No. I want my fucking house back!
MIKE
Is she still with that guy?
TERRY
You mean my contractor? The guy I
hired? Yeah, she is. I can just
picture that little scumbag walking
around my house wearing his tool
belt. Here.
He hands Mike his blackberry.
TERRY (CONT'D)
Take a picture for me.
Terry pulls down his pants and moons Mike.

TERRY MIKE
Take it! Jesus, Ter!
TERRY (CONT'D)
Hurry! It's cold.
Mike takes the picture. Terry takes the blackberry back.
MIKE
Don't send it.
TERRY
Too late. I hate her.
They start to walk.
MIKE
Maybe you should move back into the
city? Get a new job. Shake it up a
bit.
TERRY
Nah. Finley called me. He's
starting up a new fund out here in
May so I'm gonna wait for that.
MIKE
That guy's starting another fund?
TERRY
Yeah. He's an animal. He prints
money. Come on, let's finish
strong.
Terry starts to run. Mike follows. After about thirty feet,
Mike pulls up. He's breathing is labored.
MIKE
Hold up!
TERRY
What?
MIKE
Just...hold up.
Mike is really breathing hard now. He's making some funny
noises.
TERRY
You alright?
Mike just holds up a hand. He can't really speak.
5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 14
CONTINUED:
TERRY (CONT'D) MIKE
Mike, what the fuck? What's (Barely audible)
wrong? Yeah. Fine. I just...
He drops to a knee. He's not alright.
TERRY (CONT'D)
Holy fuck! Mike? Hang on pal.
Terry takes out his black berry but immediately fumbles it
into the wet mud.
TERRY (CONT'D)
Fuck! Fuck!
He grabs it and shakes it out but it's dead.
TERRY (CONT'D)
You gotta be kidding me. Shit.
Mike is still wheezing. Terry turns his attention.
TERRY (CONT'D)
Is it your heart, buddy? Are you
having a heart attack?
MIKE
No! I'm not having a heart attack!
I just...can't breathe...
TERRY
That could be a heart attack, Mike.
You should lie down.
Terry tries to help him but it's only seems to annoy Mike.
MIKE TERRY
Get off me! Just lie down.
MIKE
No! It's wet. I don't want to lie
down.
TERRY
Who cares? You might be dying. Are
you cold? Do you feel cold?
MIKE
Yeah. I'm lying on the ground.
TERRY
Look into my eyes, Mike. Look into
my eyes.

CONTINUED:
They are now engaged in a weird wrestling match.
WOMAN (O.S.)
Are you alright?
Terry looks to see TWO FORTY YEAR OLD WOMEN in jogging gear
staring at them.
An ambulance pulls away revealing Mike and Terry sitting in
the open back of Terry's LEXUS SUV.
TERRY
OK dude, how long has that been
happening?
MIKE
Couple of months. The doctor says
it's stress.
TERRY
Seriously? Did he prescribe
anything for you?
MIKE
Yeah. Jogging. Why the hell you
think I'm doing this?
TERRY
Jesus. That scared the shit out of
me. What are you so stressed about,
Mike?
MIKE
(SHEEPISH)
I don't know. Work. Money.
Everything.
TERRY
Is it that bad?
MIKE
Yeah. It is. I don't know how much
longer I can keep my practice
going.
TERRY
Really? Holy shit, Mike! What're
you gonna do?
5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 16
CONTINUED:
MIKE
I have no frickin' idea. I've been
trying everything.
TERRY
Have you told Jackie?
MIKE
Not yet. I don't want to freak her
out.
TERRY
Good call. So we just need a new
strategy, that's all. What about
that Judge that's always throwing
work your way? Can't she help you
out?
MIKE
Judge Lee, yeah. If it wasn't for
her I'd probably be out of business
already. I just need more.
TERRY
Is there anything else you can do
for money?
MIKE
What the hell am I gonna do?
Bartend? I'm a lawyer, Ter. I
practice law.
MIKE (CONT'D) TERRY
And it's not like I'm some I know.
scumbag. I help old people
for Christ sake. No offense
but your pal, Finley doesn't
give a crap about anything
but making money.
TERRY
Yeah. But that's why he makes it.
MIKE
No shit, Ter. Thanks for the
update.
Mike walks with Leo Poplar up the steps of the courthouse.
Mike walks toward his car carrying AN OLD TV SET. He puts it
into the back of his car which is packed with ITEMS from
Leo's house.
Mike and Leo arrive at Oak Knoll.
Mike pulls up and walks into the Convenience Store. He buys
cigarettes and walks outside. He walks outside, around the
corner and then behind the store. He lights a cigarette and
then throws the pack into the dumpster. He stands there
smoking.
Jackie and Stella are waiting in the parking lot. Mike is
lagging behind carrying Abby and chatting with some OLDER
PARISHIONER'S. He's charming and he's working it. He finally
catches up with Jackie and they walk toward the car.

JACKIE
Let's go, Mr. Mayor. It's cold and
I need to pick up some bagels for
your mom's.
MIKE
OK. OK. I just have to make one
stop first.
JACKIE
Where?
MIKE
I have to swing by a client's house
and shut off the water.
JACKIE
Why?
MIKE
Because it's freezing and I don't
want his pipes to burst.
JACKIE
No, I mean why are you doing it?
MIKE
(CASUALLY)
What? Oh, because I'm his guardian.
JACKIE
What? Since when?
MIKE ABBY
Just last week. Mommy, I want a bagel.
JACKIE (CONT'D)
That's a big deal, Mike. Were you
even gonna tell me?
MIKE JACKIE
It's not a big deal. And yes, It is too.
I was gonna tell you.
JACKIE (CONT'D)
You don't have time to be taking
care of some old man.
5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 24
CONTINUED:
MIKE
Jack, he's in Oak Knoll. They do
everything. I just have to check in
on him from time to time.
JACKIE
And who pays for that?
MIKE
He does. It comes out of his estate
and he can afford it. Trust me.
JACKIE
I don't get it. You've never done
it before.
MIKE
No I haven't.
JACKIE
So why are you doing it now?
MIKE
It's just...the right thing to do,
alright. We couldn't find his
daughter and I'm just trying to
help the guy. It's really not a big
deal.
JACKIE
Well, it sounds like a big deal.
And you should have told me.
ABBY
What's a big deal?
JACKIE
Ask your daddy, sweetie. Maybe
he'll tell you.
ABBY
Daddy, what's a big deal?
Mike walks up the front walk. The YOUNG MAN is listening to
his Ipod and smoking a cigarette. Mike approaches and waves.
The YOUNG MAN removes his headphones. He has a BRUISE on his
left eye.
MIKE
How you doing? Can I help you?
YOUNG MAN
No.
MIKE
Are you looking for Mr. Poplar?
YOUNG MAN
Yeah.
MIKE
Well, he doesn't live here anymore.
YOUNG MAN
Where does he live?
MIKE
You mind telling me why you're
looking for him first?
The Young Man sizes Mike up. Then...
YOUNG MAN
He's my Grandfather. I came to live
with him.
Mike is momentarily stunned by the news. Then he looks back
at the car where Jackie gives him a "What's going on?" look.
Uh oh.

Mike and Kyle exit he building and walk toward the parking
lot.
MIKE
How did the visit go?
KYLE
OK. He fell asleep watching TV. So
he lives there now?
MIKE
Yeah. Your grandfather is in the
early stages of dementia, Kyle. So
sometimes he does things and says
things that don't make sense.
KYLE
Are you a friend of his or
something?
MIKE
I'm his guardian.
KYLE
What's that mean?
MIKE
It means I make sure he's well
taken care of.
KYLE
That's cool.
Kyle lights a cigarette.
5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 30
Mike and Kyle are waiting for the bus. Mike pulls out his
wallet.
MIKE
Here's fifty bucks in case you need
it.
Mike counts his cash.
KYLE
I have money.
MIKE
Actually it's only forty-three but
take it. You never know.
KYLE
I have enough money. But thanks.
The bus pulls up.
MIKE
Well, good luck, Kyle.
KYLE
Yeah. You too, Mike.
Kyle gets on the bus. Mike watches it pull away.
Mike and Kyle walk out of the New Providence Police Station.
MIKE
So what happened?
KYLE
I decided not to go home.
MIKE
And then you decided you'd break
into your Grandfather's house?
KYLE
You mind if I have a quick smoke?
MIKE
Yeah, I do. Get in the car.
Kyle is sitting on the back steps and smoking a cigarette.
Terry is sitting in his parked car, talking on his cell.
TERRY (O.S.)
So get rid of him again.
Kyle and Mike are walking toward the car.
MIKE
You have fun?
KYLE
Yeah.
MIKE
When's the last time you wrestled?
KYLE
A couple years ago.
MIKE
Why'd you stop?
KYLE
Just felt like it.
Kyle just shrugs and Mike let's it go. They arrive at Mike's
car and Mike talks to Kyle over the roof.
MIKE
So let me ask you something, Kyle.
How good are you?
Kyle just looks at Mike, almost blank.
KYLE
I'm pretty good.
Mike walks out of the bank and dials his cell phone.
MIKE
Hey honey. I'm good. Could you do
me a favor and drop that health
insurance check in the mail? I just
forgot to mail it. Yeah, it's on my
desk. Thanks. I'll call you later.
Mike and Kyle get out of the car and unload a couple of small
mats from the backseat.
MIKE
You bring the tape?
KYLE
Yeah. It's in my bag.
Mike grabs his briefcase from the trunk.
KYLE (CONT'D)
Hey, Mike, can I ask you something?
MIKE
Yeah. Of course. What?
KYLE
Leo told me that some Judge made
him move into that place. Is that
true or is he just making that up?
Mike wasn't expecting this.
MIKE
No. That's true, pal.
KYLE
Why?
5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 67

MIKE
Well because they can take good
care of him there, Kyle.
Mike's phone rings.
KYLE
But he wants to live at home.
MIKE
I know, pal. Hang on a minute.
(Into cell phone)
Hello? Yes. This is him.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Oh. Can you hang for a moment?
(TO KYLE)
Hey, I have to take this. I'll be
right in, OK? We can talk in a
minute.
Kyle walks inside. Mike watches him go, already regretting
the lie. He exhales...
MIKE (CONT'D)
(INTO PHONE)
Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.
Yeah. How are you doing?
A school bus drives through the New Jersey Farm country.
Kyle and Jackie walk through a park with Leo.
Terry and Kyle stand side by side holding onto two ropes.
Mike is cutting down the dead tree with a chain saw. Jackie
Abby watch from the front porch. Mike finishes cutting and

Mike and Terry are standing outside talking.
MIKE
Yeah, it's that bad.
TERRY
Just take her to court, you'll kill
her.
MIKE
I can't.
TERRY
Why not? She's a freaking mess.
You're a pillar of the community,
Mike.
MIKE
I just can't go back in front of
Judge Lee, it won't look good,
trust me.
TERRY
So maybe you'll get a different
judge.
MIKE
She's the only Judge who handles
these cases and if I look bad in
front of her right now, I'm
screwed. I'll have to close my
fricking doors.
TERRY
Then dump it. Give her Poplar. It
sucks but you've got your practice
to worry about, right?
MIKE
Yeah, I do.
TERRY
Incoming, dude.
Mike turns. Kyle approaches.

MIKE
Hey, pal.
KYLE
Do you know she wants to take Leo
back to Ohio?
MIKE
Yeah. She just told me today.
KYLE
You're not gonna let her do that
are you?
MIKE
I don't know Kyle. It's
complicated.
KYLE
What's complicated about it? She
doesn't give a shit about Leo. They
hate each other. You can't let her
take him.
MIKE
OK. OK. Look, just go get ready for
practice and I'll deal with it.
KYLE
Fine but I told her I'm staying
with you guys until we leave.
Kyle leaves. Terry just looks at Mike.
TERRY
Wow. What's your play?
MIKE
I have no idea. I have no freaking
idea!
TERRY
She's looking for a payout, dude.
Just buy her stake and give her an
exit.
MIKE
What the hell does that mean?
TERRY
Just give her some of Leo's money
and send her home. He's not gonna
miss it. He's in happy land.

Mike stops. A flash of inspiration.
MIKE (CONT'D)
That's right. She's not and she
doesn't and that's my play.
TERRY
What's your play?
Mike takes out his phone and dials.
MIKE
Don't worry about it. I just need
to make a call. Can you get
practice started?
TERRY
Really? You want me to slap your
face? Get you psyched up for the
call?
MIKE
No. I really don't.
Mike walks into the brick and glass tower.
MIKE (O.S.)
Look, we're all concerned with
what's best for Leo so I'm hoping
we can settle this in an amicable
way.
Mike, Terry and Kyle walk out of the school. The entire
family is waiting for them. Jackie gives Kyle a big hug. Abby
takes his hand. They all get into their car. Mike is just
about to get in but then he sees Cindy standing by her car
watching. He shuts his door and crosses to her.
MIKE
Why are you here?
CINDY
I wanted to see my son wrestle.
MIKE
Yeah, well your son had a pretty
good chance to do something special
in there. Maybe even change his
life and that's gone now. I hope
you're happy.
CINDY
That's not my fault.
MIKE
It isn't? Why do you think he lost
his shit in there, huh?! What do
you want, lady?
CINDY
I want my father.

MIKE
It didn't sound like that the other
day. It sounded like you hated the
guy.
CINDY
You have no idea what my father
used to be like. No idea! He wasn't
like he is now! He treated me like
shit and he was all I had!
MIKE
So now you want to return the
favor? Is that it?!
CINDY
I want that commission! That should
be mine!
MIKE
And that's why you're doing all
this? For fifteen hundred dollars a
month?
CINDY
Isn't that why you did it?
This stops Mike in his tracks.
MIKE
Alright, I'll tell you what. You
want the commission? You can have
it. And you don't even have to take
Leo. I'll take care of him for free
and I'll send you the check every
month. On one condition.
CINDY
What's that?
MIKE
You leave Kyle here. With us. Until
he finishes high school.
CINDY
I'm his mother. He belongs with me.
MIKE
Are you sure he feels that way?

CINDY
Don't tell me what my son feels!
He's coming with me and there isn't
anything you can do about that.

Then you can't have that
commission.
CINDY
We'll see about that.
MIKE
Yeah, we will.
Mike turns and walks away.
CINDY
I want to see my son!
MIKE
Then call him! You have his number!
Mike's car pulls up. They all get out and run up to the
house.

There's a light on.

What's he doing?
MIKE
Watching TV.
TERRY
What's he watching?
JACKIE
Who cares?
MIKE

Mike knocks on the window. Leo doesn't register it.
MIKE (CONT'D)
He's not responding. Ring the bell.
Jackie does. Leo still doesn't respond.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Nothing. Fuck.
TERRY
This is freaking spooky.
Mike climbs down back onto the porch.
TERRY (CONT'D)

but reciprocate.
MIKE
Would you let me explain?!
KYLE
Explain what? How you lied to me?
How you lied to Leo?
Kyle head pumps. Mike takes the bait and jumps back.

Kyle head fakes again but this time he's in. Before Mike
knows what hits him, he's on his back.
MIKE TERRY

He doesn't stop. Jackie turns to Mike.
JACKIE (CONT'D)
Is that true, Mike?
MIKE
Yeah, it is.
Mike gets up.
JACKIE
So why'd you move him if he wanted
to stay here.
MIKE
Because it would have been too much

MIKE
No! I just didn't think it would
get this complicated.
JACKIE
Really? Or you just didn't think
you'd get caught?
This stops Mike in his tracks. He can't answer. Jackie turns
