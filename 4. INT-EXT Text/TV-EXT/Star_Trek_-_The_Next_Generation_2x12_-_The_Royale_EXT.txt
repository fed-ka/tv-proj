       We have achieved orbit around 
       Theta Eight... 
 
 
     seen from a different angle, still in orbit around 
     Theta Eight. 
 
 
     MATERIALIZE in a featureless black void. It is 
     completely still, no sound, no movement. The calm is 
     unnerving. 
 
         RIKER 
        (tense) 
       Where are we? 
 
     Data checks his tricorder. 
 
         DATA 
       Exactly where Geordi said we would 
       be. The structure is directly 
       behind us.

     They all turn and look behind them. All they can see 
     is blackness... 
 
         DATA 
        (continuing) 
       I am detecting vast ammonia storms 
       raging mere kilometers away. Yet 
       they do not appear to penetrate 
       this breathable zone. 
 
         RIKER 
        (soft, awed) 
       It's like the eye of a hurricane. 
 
     Data has wandered toward where he believes the 
     structure to be. He looks up, as though sensing the 
     hugeness of the thing. 
 
         DATA 
       It is here. It must be here, yet 
       we cannot see it. 
 
      19   INTERCUT WITH PICARD ON THE MAIN BRIDGE 
 
         RIKER'S COM VOICE 
       Enterprise, this is Commander 
       Riker. We have arrived in a very 
       unusual place... it is like being 
       in the eye of a hurricane. It 
       is completely calm, no sound, no 
       movement, yet a few meters away 
       a storm, which we can neither see 
       nor hear, is raging. 
 
         PICARD'S COM VOICE 
       Describe the structure. 
 
         RIKER 
       We can't see it. 
 
         WORF 
       Commander, over here. I see 
       something! 
 
     Data and Riker hurry over to Worf. The Klingon has 
     discovered an old-fashioned revolving door, seemingly 
     situated in the middle of nothing. It turns slowly, as 
     though beckoning them... 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                                                                                   Converted to .pdf for pdfscreenplays.net

         WORF 
        (continuing) 
       What is this thing? 
 
         PICARD'S COM VOICE 
       What is it, Commander? 
 
         RIKER 
        (to Picard, amazed) 
       I think it's a door. An antique. 
 
         DATA 
       Judging by its location, it may 
       be an entrance to the structure 
       we seek. 
 
     The three of them exchange wary glances... 
 
         RIKER 
       Well... this is what we came here 
       for. 
        (to Picard) 
       Captain, we are entering the 
       structure. 
 
     Riker cautiously steps in and the revolving door 
     automatically turns to the right. Riker disappears 
     into the darkness, and when the door stops revolving he 
     is gone. Worf looks at Data and then follows suit. 
     Data follows him... 
 
 
     in orbit around the planet. 
 
         PICARD (V.O.) 
       Captain's log, supplemental. We 
       remain in orbit around Theta 
       Eight, still out of contact with 
       the away team.

     he intones:
