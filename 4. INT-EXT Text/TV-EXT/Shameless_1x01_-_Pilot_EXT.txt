

      Blazing fire. Public bonfire. POPS and BANGS of fireworks.  A 
      MALE VOICE begins over luminous faces - adults and kids - 
      that the CAMERA picks out of the crowd in the bonding glow.

                                  FRANK (V.O.)

                    Nobody's saying this neighborhood's 
                    the Garden of Eden, hell some 
                    people say God avoids this place 

                      altogether, but it's been a good 
                    home to us, to me and my kids, who 
                    I'm proud of; 'cause every single 
                    one of them reminds me a little bit 
                    of me. Fiona, my rock, a huge help.

      FIONA, attractive, but not gorgeous, eighteen, laughing.

                                  FRANK (CONT'D)

                    Has all the best qualities of her 
                    mother -- except she s not a raging 
                    psycho bitch. 


      QUICK-CUT to Fiona with two Kleenexs and two  kids, put s a 

      tissue to each kid s nose and orders  Blow! . They do.

                                  FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Lip, smart as a whip. Straight A s 
                    and the honor roll. And people 
                    thought when I dropped him on his 
                    head it was a bad thing. 

      LIP, sixteen, handsome, athletic, drinking a brown-bagged 
      Pabst tallboy, no doubt lifted from some 7-11.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Boy s definitely going somewhere --

      QUICK-CUT of Lip, charging STRAIGHT AT and over us, followed 

      by two Chicago cops, in heated, sweaty pursuit.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)

                    Ian, industrious, conscientious, 
                      ambitious, incredible work ethic.

      IAN, fifteen, smiling, a little goofy, instantly likeable.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Don t have a clue where he got that 
                    from. I m no biologist, but he 
                    looks a bit like my brother, he and 
                    the ex were close. Wants to be a 
                      paratrooper.

      QUICK-CUT of Ian in ROTC uniform, seriously working a wooden 
      rifle in close-order drills on a weedy playground.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Girls are going to love this guy. 
                    Carl... Carl...

      CARL, eleven. Shaved head, also drinking from a brown bag -- 
      here s hoping there s a Fanta Orange hiding in there.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    I don t really know that much about 
                    Carl... Oh, he s got beautiful 
                    hair, fetches top dollar at the wig 
                    shop. We don t tell the wig lady 
                    he s a magnet for lice.  Debbie! 
                    Sent by God, a total angel, don t 
                    know what we d do without her.

      DEBBIE, ten. Hooting and hollering at the fire, holding her 
      toddler brother, LIAM, in her arms. 

                                  FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Raises money for UNICEF year-round, 
                    some of which she turns in.

      QUICK-CUT of Debbie, sitting on her bed, shaking change out 
      of an upside down, much-used, orange UNICEF box.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Liam, gonna be a star --

      QUICK-CUT to the toddler Liam, wearing a diaper and nothing 
      else, coming straight at us down a hallway, in the midst of a 
      SCREAMING, head-banging TANTRUM.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    -- once Medicade agrees to cover 
                    the Ritalin. 
                          (and)
                    Kev and Veronica, fantastic 
                      neighbors!

      KEV, thirty, handsome, none too bright, arms wrapped tightly 
      around VERONICA. Thirty-four, black, sexy, vivacious, tank 
      top at least two sizes too small.

                                  FRANK (CONT'D)
                    There s nothing they won t do for 
                    each other...or too each other. 

      QUICK-CUT to Kev pulling a red ball out of his mouth, 
      Veronica behind him in leather Catwoman mask. He grins.

                                  KEV
                    Didn t hurt half as much as I 
                    thought it would...  Your turn.

                                  FRANK (VO)
                    Love to fuck. I never realized how 
                    little sex I was having  til V and 
                    Kev moved in next door. And me...

      Finally, a face to go with the voice. Forties, glassy-eyed. 
      Long, unkempt hair, Army surplus jacket, tattered Van Halen 
      World Tour  84 T-shirt. Hoisting his sixth or seventh 40 of 
      the night as SIRENS build in the distance.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Frank Gallagher, father, teacher, 
                    mentor. Captain of our ship. We may 
                    not have much, but the kids can all 
                    think for ourselves, for which they 
                    have me to thank, and all of us, to 
                    a man, know first and foremost the 
                    most vital necessity in this life -- 
                    we know how to party!

      The SIRENS are closer now. The crowd finally begins to 
      disperse, Frank among the last to go. As the CAMERA pulls 
      away from him, we SLOWLY REVEAL - not a bonfire - but a 
      burning abandoned car! And they weren't fireworks but 
      exploding spray cans kids have been tossing into the blaze.


      Fire engines and Chicago PD cars speed onto the scene as the 
      local community scatters to avoid arrest leave, flipping the 
      finger and yelling obscenities at the killjoy cops as we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Lip, Ian, Carl and finally Debbie with Liam jammed into a 
      baby backpack, legs and arms flapping as she runs, all 
      bombing out of the house, scattering in different directions.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Fiona walks briskly along the concourse of the White Sox s 
      home field passing legions of fans filing in, makes her way 
      to an All Star Stand - beer, nachos, and of course, hot dogs. 
      Swings under the counter, smiles at one of the women already 
      working as she grabs an apron and Sox cap from the rack.

                                  WOMAN
                    No Candi again?

                                  FIONA
                    Bobby s got a bail hearing.

                                  WOMAN
                    That kid s going to be the death of 
                    her. What is it this time?

                                  FIONA
                    Tried tagging a cop car, with the 
                    cops still in it.

      Fiona steps up to the counter, smiles at a customer. A middle-
      aged man in an A-Rod jersey and NY cap.

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    Yankees, huh? No need to buy a 
                    beer, you ll be wearing one soon 
                    enough. What can I get ya, sir?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Lip approaches a small house.  A middle aged woman, SHEILA, 
      opens the door microscopically.  The outside world scares 
      her.  But she's happy enough at the moment.

                                  LIP
                    I m here to help Karen study for 
                    her mid-term.

                                  SHEILA
                    Okay.  Take your shoes off.

                                  LIP
                    What?

                                    KAREN'S MUM
                    I'll get you a plastic bag.

      Which is a bit baffling for him, but what the hell.


      Fiona chases the suitor outside, but the thief and his 
      cronies escape in an anonymous sedan, only illuminating their  
      headlights once the license plate's too distant to read.


                                  FIONA
                    Assholes!

      Other clubbers have emerged to witness this, Steve too - 
      eventually. He's brushing glass and debris off his clothes.

                                  STEVE
                    Sorry.

      Veronica pushes through the crowd, glowing with admiration 
      for Steve's stunt.

                                  VERONICA
                    That was fucking incredible. Truly, 
                    honestly, one of the most heroic 
                    things I've ever seen.

      Steve beams with gratitude. She turns to Fiona.

                                  VERONICA (CONT'D)
                    You see him?
                          (to Steve)
                    Stupid. But, man...! Heroic!

      Fiona smiles, she saw it.

                                  VERONICA (CONT D)
                    My god, you re bleeding.

      She s right, his forehead. He touches it. Smiles, his intro:

                                  STEVE
                    Steve. I was gonna offer to buy you 
                    a drink anyway.

      Veronica's nodding consent on Fiona's behalf, which somehow 
        communicates how much she'd like her friend to find a guy 
      this nice.  Which is also occurring to Fiona as a decent 
        compensation for this shitty night out. And, in the magic of 
      this moment, they turn back towards the club, until --

                                    BOUNCER
                          (blocking them)
                    Where do you think you re going?

                                  VERONICA
                    Are you serious?

                                    BOUNCER
                    Where s his stamp?

                                  VERONICA
                    His what?
                          (to Fiona, outraged)
                    Can you believe this fucking joker?
                          (to Bouncer)
                    If you were doing your job, he 
                    wouldn't have had to.

                                    BOUNCER
                    No stamp, no re-entry.

                                  VERONICA
                    Is he for real?
                          (to Bouncer)
                    Fat useless prick!

                                    BOUNCER
                    Fine. You're all barred.

                                  FIONA
                    For what?

                                    BOUNCER
                          (trumps up a charge)

                                  FIONA
                    He probably let 'em get away 
                    because he knows 'em.

                          (alarmed/it's true)
                    Hey, shut up, skank.

                                  STEVE
                    Watch your mouth.

                                    BOUNCER
                    Or you'll be doing - what?

      Bouncer looks ready to deck Steve, who is no match, not in a 
      million years. Fiona steps in.

                                  FIONA
                    Forget it.
                          (to Veronica)
                    Lets get a cab.
                          (to Steve)
                    Thanks.  Thanks anyway.

      Steve stands down, waves delicately to the girls. The Bouncer 
      at ease. Then Steve suddenly spins and whacks the fat prick. 
      One hard punch, taking us and the Bouncer by surprise.

      Then runs like the wind across traffic. The Bouncer takes off 
      after Steve but doesn't stand a chance, Steve s fast.

      ANGLE - Veronica and Fiona, shocked and amused, cheering 
      Steve on. The Bouncer won't risk the traffic.  Gives up.

      Fiona and V circumnavigate the Bouncer s return to continue 
      in Steve's direction, howling abuse at the Bouncer from a 
      safe distance. Steve taunts the guy and flashes his ass for 
      the howling amusement of his newfound allies as we --

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Veronica and Kev stroll the short journey home, sharing the 
      weight of her hefty bag of medical supplies. Kev spots 
      Steve's BMW in the street.

                                  KEV
                    That's his?

                                  VERONICA
                    Yeah. Well, company car.

                                  KEV
                    Kinda company?

                                  VERONICA
                    Internet start-up?

                                  KEV
                    Earning - what?

      She finds the question annoying, checking Kev's envy as 
      competitive male.

                    Coupla mil a year. Lost both 
                    parents by the age of ten, high

                    Wings... ten thousand employees 
                    kissing his ass. Yes boss, no boss!

      Kev s feeling belittled by the story she's conjured up.

                                  VERONICA (CONT'D)
                    So why shouldn't he ride around in 
                    style?

      Kev catches her smirking to herself.

                                  KEV
                    You just made that up?

      She chuckles at his rank gullibility.

                                  KEV (CONT'D)
                    Why do you DO that?

                    Hi, nice to meet you, I'm Veronica. 
                    What's your pre-tax income?

                    his shirt off, though, did you?

      So there it is - amoebic, homosapien jealousy.

                                  VERONICA
                    Not one bit!   fact, if you hadn't 
                    walked in, Fiona and I were gonna 
                    knock him down and tag-team him.


      With which, she grabs Kev's butt with hardcore affection - 
      she s flattered by his jealousy. 

                                  VERONICA (CONT D)
                    Now I guess I m stuck with you.

      Kev grins back with a horny glint as they push through their 
      gate towards their house.

                                  KEV
                    Fiona tag-team? Is that an option?

      Fiona climbs the metal stairs of a clean but inexpensive, two-
      story motel, Liam on her hip. Finds a maid s cart parked 
      outside an open door, KNOCKS. 

                                  FIONA
                    Rita?

      A Hispanic woman appears from the bathroom, yellow Playtex 
      gloves, toilet brush in hand, thirty, harried.

                                  RITA
                    Anne s school called, she s sick.

      She s peeling off the gloves, handing the brush to Fiona. 

                                  RITA (CONT D)
                      Everything up to 204 s clean. I 
                    should be back in a couple hours. 

                                  FIONA
                    Raul won t care?

                                  RITA
                    Smoked his lunch again. He won t 
                    even know.

      Rita grabs her jacket off the maid s cart, pulls it on.

                                  RITA (CONT D)
                    Thanks for this. I m making tamales 
                    tonight, I ll drop off a dozen. 
                          (already out the door)
                    Oh, and take all the toilet paper 
                    and soap you need.

      And she s gone. Fiona looks into the room, sighs, plops Liam 
      down on the bed. Turns on the TV for him to watch. As she 
      pulls on the yellow gloves and starts for the bathroom, we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Lip pulls a reluctant Ian past houses, people and local 
      stores. He's on a mission. 

                                  LIP
                    Just keep talking about science.

                                  IAN
                    I don t know anything about 
                    science!

                                  LIP
                    So, just read from the table of 
                    elements!


      Lip falls from the sky into the front yard.  Landing with a 
      crippling THUD. Ouch!  Was he pushed? No, his eyes dart up to 
      a bedroom window, Eddie looking down, growling rage.

                                  EDDIE (OS)
                    Further you go, more I'll kill you.

      Lip leaps to his feet, races to catch up with Ian in the 
      distance, who's carrying both their sneakers, urgently 
      rescued from the doorstep. Lip limping all the way.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Eddie has just stepped outside with a box as he hears that 
      last line, spinning on the expletive --


                                  EDDIE
                    Hey, you watch your mouth!

                                  KAREN
                    GET! FUCKED! 
 

      He races for the front door.

                                  EDDIE
                    Don't try blaming me for this!

      But Karen kicks the door shut in his face.  Locks it.

      Eddie dives to the front window, where a new testament sign 
        proclaims'JESUS SAID: I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIGHT'

                                  EDDIE (CONT'D)
                    You are your own worst enemies, you 
                    two! They say bad things come in 
                    threes. They don't. Twos! YOU two! 

      He ducks suddenly as a clown lamp comes flying through the 
      window, demolishing the new testament sentiment.

      Eddie rescues the clown, packs it with finality into his 
      rental car, parked outside.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Veronica and Kev hand-carry the heavy old washing machine 
      from the Gallaghers to their house two doors up the street. 
      both smoking, yelling garbled instructions to each other.

                                  KEV
                    Hey, maybe you could do him, we 
                    need a new microwave.

      NOTE:  The house immediately next to the GALLAGHERS' is ply-
                                                    'Grandad's dead. There is 
      boarded with a hand-painted sign 
      nothing else to steal from this house. So FUCK OFF!'

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Steve sprints up the stairs and out onto the platform. He 
      gasps for breath as he looks around, but it's empty. He's 
      late. Thinks he's missed her. Curses himself.

      Then a train on the opposite track clears. And there she is, 
      smiling, just as he remembered her. He jogs down the stairs 
      onto the elevated walkway that leads to the other platform. 

      Halfway across, she appears. He slows, walks to her. Kisses 
      her gently. She returns it carefully, but with increasingly 
      rare and satisfying confidence. Such a big first for Fiona.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Fiona waits alone, smoking self-consciously.

      Steve appears from inside, now wearing the green valet s 
      waistcoat. Name tag, everything. 

      Nods to the young remaining valet who quickly jogs off as if 
      to get another car just as a sleek ASTON MARTIN pulls up. An 
      elegant couple leave their car door open for valet parking.

      Steve boldly slings his own jacket over the arm of a shocked 
      Fiona, greets the couple with a beaming, servile smile.

                                  STEVE
                    Welcome to Charlie Trotters.

      The gent hands over his keys, shepherds his wife into the 
      restaurant. Steve hops in behind the wheel and spins off 
      leaving Fiona watching, breathless.

      Now what? Silence. She waits. And waits.

      A CELLPHONE starts ringing in Steve's jacket. Rings and 
      rings. Eventually, Fiona realizes, answers it.

                                  STEVE (VO) (CONT'D)
                    I've confused you. I m sorry. I 
                    don't 'buy and sell' cars. I just 
                    sell 'em. But the cars I sell are 
                    mainly... not mine.

      Pause. She urgently calculates the reality of who and what 
      Steve is. The Aston Martin backs up into frame beside her.

      She legs it to climb into the car. Steve shoves his own CD 
      into the player and they re gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Lip checks his watch. That doesn't sound right. Plus the 
      lights are on but there's no-one to be seen. He knocks.  
      Nothing. Walks round the block.
