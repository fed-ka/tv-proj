RUSH HOUR
ON a pair of black Dexter penny loafers diligently
pedaling an old Schwinn mountain bike. ADJUST ANGLE now
to meet the bicyclist...
He's African-American. Anywhere from 33 to 40. Wears
wire-rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased
slacks and a solid green tie. An unobtrusive figure, at
once familiar and yet undiscerning. The type you'd pass
on a sidewalk and never even notice. He's TREVOR GARFIELD.
ADJUST ANGLE FURTHER now to reveal the upper promenade
bike path and a dramatic view of Lower Manhattan behind
him. Morning sun glimmers off the Trade Center towers.
Trevor's shadow skitters along the wooden path, 160 ft.
above the East River.
A fat briefcase, strapped to the back of his bike, rocks
back and forth as he pumps the pedals.
FROM ABOVE now a sweeping view of Trevor, alone on the
bike path, a speck, suspended above a sea of rush hour
traffic on the bridge below.

A cyclone fence frames the stalwart face of the old
three-story administration building. Ubiquitous gray
patches of paint fail to cover where taggers have most
recently left their marks. The ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, a
black man with a booming voice, barks at late-comers who
are about to be tardy...
ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL

Okay, let's get inside. C'mon.

TWO STUDENTS make passing comments...
AUGGIE

Traffic bottle-necks as students cross in front of cars,

Compared to the scarred, institutional look of Roosevelt
Whitney, the face of John Quincy Adams is unblemished.

Sagging pants (Dickies, Ben Davis) and oversized jackets

different socio-economic and ethnic groups stick with
their own kind; the IHPs (Individual Honors Program), the

Increasing evidence of tagging, and bands of wandering
students, indicate a higher degree of disorder the
further one gets from the Main Office.
FROM ABOVE NOW, like Algernon and his maze, Trevor
negotiates his own path deeper and deeper into the
configuration of bungalows.
... And Trevor's trepidation. Eyes discerning every
passerby. His PULSE AUDIBLY RACES, senses heightened.
SHIFTING INTO SLOW MOTION AGAIN... And the reverberating
SOUND of a SPRAY PAINT MARBLE as Trevor rounds a corner
and comes face to face with three tag-bangers concealing
spray paint cans inside their oversized jackets. One of
the taggers locks eyes with Trevor as he passes, a slow
premonitory burn. The tagger has a "skin tight" (pelon)
hair cut and a string of black rosary beads around his
neck. A barcode tattoo on the back of his neck identi-
fies BENNY.

... Behind the bungalows, adjacent the delivery gate.
Meet DAVE CHILDRESS, a forty-something ditto-head.
The residual effects of a hangover linger as he sneaks a
cigarette before first period. He wears a faded Hawaiian
shirt and Huarache sandals. An old military tattoo
emblazons his left forearm. As he crushes out his
cigarette, something catches his eye.
28
28
... Thru a chain-link fence we see a handful of cholo-
types loitering around the shed.
Childress investigates.
As he approaches the fence...
CHILDRESS
... Hey, ese(s)?!
Homeboys scatter in all directions, some hop the chain-
link fence, others scurry out a narrow gate behind the
shed. Childress weighs an amused smirk. Now out of
nowhere a gangbanger lurches from the shed, buttoning
his sagging Dickies and tripping over his own feet. He
scrambles out the back gate and is gone.
Childress, curiosity piqued, now enters the compound
through a tear in the fence.

Do I know you?
BENNY

You should. You're fuckin' with

TAGGER

Cesar and Paco burst into hysterical laughter which
only manages to get Benny piqued.
TAGGER

Look, I didn't mean nothin'. Lemme

Cesar and Paco laugh harder.
BENNY
(to Cesar)
Eh, shut up, mojado!

Don't mess wit' me, whiteboy.

He pulls a .380 or a .25 automatic out of his pocket.
Brandishes it at Cesar and Paco...
BENNY
I said shut up! Shut the fuck up!
A BEEPER hooked on Benny's pants pocket BEEPS. Benny
shuts it off. The Tagger sees his opportunity and makes
a break for it. Without a second thought, Benny SHOOTS
him in the leg. Tagger crumbles to the ground. Benny's
really pissed now. Checks his beeper's glow-in-the-dark
face for the message.

Venting rage, Benny walks up the wounded Tagger and
STARTS SHOOTING (one hand high near his face, shooting
downward). Now he kisses the crucifix on his rosary like
a sick, distorted affectation.
BENNY
Dis is K.O.S.' neighborhood.
Cesar and Paco laugh even harder now, falling all
over each other. Benny storms off. He marches past a
street lamp and is swallowed up by the night.

Trevor and Ellen are greeted by Ellen's golden retriever
Jack, who's chained to the front porch. JACK WHIMPERS,
ready to bark.
ELLEN
Don't start barking, Jack.
TREVOR
(petting him)
Hey there, boy. You're a good
dog. Yes, you are.
Jack nuzzles up to Trevor, tail wagging furiously, no
barking. Now Trevor stands and faces Ellen...
ELLEN
Sorry for reacting the way I did
back there.
TREVOR
Don't apologize. That's how most
people react.
ELLEN
Didn't scare me. It just
surprised me.
ELLEN
... Thanks for dinner.
I had a
good time.
TREVOR
You're welcome.
Awkward silence. Trevor struggles with the urge to kiss
her good night. They look at each other timidly for a
moment. Now he moves to kiss her and she inadvertently
adjusts her stance. The result is a kiss that doesn't
quite hit her mouth. It's an awkward moment. Ellen
feels horrible for him, desperately picks up a strange
little plant by her feet.
ELLEN
Here... you need a little life in
that place of yours.
Trevor takes it, smiles "thanks"...

Trevor stares into her eyes, a soulful, searching gaze.
Now he averts a self-conscious look.
ELLEN
We can still be friends.
Just don't

Trevor just looks at her.
Nods, somewhat bewildered.
ELLEN
(back to lighter note)
Now, can I ask you a favor? After
you're done with Hyland, can you
give me a ride to my car? It's at

At a right angle to Lankershim, down Magnolia Blvd., Rita
Nartinez sits alone on a bus stop bench.
ELLEN (V.O.)
Oh, you should go sometime,
Trevor. I think you'd like it.
Really. It's only an hour by air.
Maybe five or six by car.
Completely different attitude
from L.A. Much more like a real
city... like Chicago or New
York...
As Ellen continues talking we see a lowered blue Nissan
mini-truck (with matching shell) pull up next to the bus
stop. A cholo from the utility shed hangs out the
passenger window and taunts Rita. Rita immediately
stands and walks back down Magnolia.
The mini-truck follows her in reverse. Rita halts and
begins ranting at the cholo, waving her arms all around.
Now she stomps away and the mini-truck drives away with a
lurch.

ACTION
Trevor and Ellen step out of the car.
TREVOR
(tentatively)
Jack?
MOVING THROUGH the chain-link fence, into the front yard.
Ellen whistles faintly. Trevor turns on his flashlight.
ELLEN
Here, boy... here, Jack.
Come to
Mommy, sweetheart.
The glare of the flashlight fixes on the trunk of the
olive tree.
Jack's chain stretching tautly toward the back alley.
ELLEN
(reacting)
... Oh, my God.
Trevor and Ellen, propelled now toward the alley, hearts
pounding, frantically rushing toward the conclusion as
the flashlight traces the length of the chain...
ELLEN
(right behind Trevor)
Jack?!
The chain disappears over the top of the alley wall.
Trevor kicks open the alley gate and freezes.

sobbing hysterically.
ELLEN

HOLD ON her fitful sobs, and...

(APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR LATER)
Trevor, a beaten hypnotic gaze, watches as an ANIMAL
REGULATIONS OFFICER fatefully slams the cargo door of his truck.
ANIMAL REGULATIONS OFFICER
Don't beat yourself up too much.
It was an accident. He was probably
after a cat... or someone walked
past back here in the alley.
Whatever it was, he jumped over the
fence. What can you do?
Ellen watches Trevor's house; behind a screen door.
93
94
A thorough investigation now at the foot of Jack's
wall...
... Trevor's flashlight fixes on a faint set of shoe prints
in the dirt.
Waffle-soled Doc Martens.
He follows their trail, down
the alley.
Hesitating at the wall again. He now focuses his
flashlight beam on a smattering of graffiti... and
discovers a fresh tag...
In black spray paint, the letters K.O.S. Trevor reaches
out and touches a coagulated trickle of paint. As he
inspects the faint residue on his fingertip...

About 2 a.m.
The street's empty.
Cesar's darkened apartment is tucked away in the
distance. Now a lone figure emerges and beats a path
through the projects... CLOSER now... it's Cesar. White
T-shirt, sagging gray dickies...
FOLLOWING HIM now... as he crosses the edge of a dirt
lot. FOCUSING ON his Doc Marten boots and their waffle-
soled print...

Cesar spray paints a wall with a can of black enamel paint.
He takes another hit. Chokes down a shit-eating grin. And
admires his work... a goofy dog smoking a blunt.
... below the dog he scrawls the word, "CARTOON." Above
it, "K.O.S. As he slips the spray can into his front
pocket, he senses a presence..
CESAR
... 'At you, Stevie?
Profound silence. Grin dissolves. Riveted, Cesar takes
another slow hit off his blunt. Suddenly a coyote darts
past him.
CESAR
(startled)
... Hells, man. Stupit dog.
His sick smirk returns. But only momentarily. Now a
premonitory flicker registers on his face. He blinks as
a Masai arrow splits the darkness and pierces his left
pectoral muscle.
Exhaling a stunned breath, Cesar looks down at the arrow.
An incredulous, stupefied laugh escapes him as he pulls
the arrow out of his chest and studies it...
The normal length of the arrow's been shortened by half
and the tip has been fitted with a modified hypodermic
needle. (The needle extends from a rubber stopper which has
retracted into the hypodermic casing, causing the
solution in the hypo to jettison through the needle and
into Cesar).
CESAR
... Mutha fuck.
Now back-pedaling, stumbling, dropping the arrow, he
turns and runs off.

Cesar collapses onto a pile of garbage bags. MOVING IN.
His eyes fixed and dilated. Forehead beaded with
perspiration. Fighting against the effects of the
injection...
Now blackness...

Eyes feverish, registering pain. His head throbs. He
begins to move and discovers a pounding in his right
hand...
... Lifting his hand up in front of his face.
Cesar's
ring index finger has been severed clean off.
Blood is
everywhere.
Cesar emotes a silent panic-stricken scream. Reduced to
a snot-sobbing wreck, he frantically searches the ground
on his hands and knees...
CESAR
My finger. Please, somebody help
me! Where's my finger?!

A churning fist of muddy water cuts a path along the
perimeter of a golf course and jogging trail.
TRACING jogging trail, KEEPING PACE now with a die-hard
runner. Something registers in the runner's eyes, pace
slowing, now stopping. Not fully comprehending what he
is looking at...
FOLLOWING HIS GAZE... THROUGH a curtain of rain and tall
swamp grass... along the riverbank... TO the base of the
Burbank Boulevard Overpass.
SLOWING ANGLE to discover precariously jutting out of the
rushing waters, in a tangle of chicken wire fence, a
partially decomposed torso...

Cesar and his tag-bangers... Cesar holds court, drowned
out by the MUSIC. Now Stevie arrives. Out of breath.
Urgent to tell his story.
Rita... Makeup subdued, wearing a cotton button-down blouse.
She watches the Quebradita from behind a tree. A desire
to be part of it, she moves a little closer...
... as Cesar notices her. His head races from Stevie's
news. Eyes penetrating. Now galvanized. On a rampage,
he shoves his way through the crowd.
Victor Sifuentes... on the opposite side of the patio,
snapping a look, spotting Cesar moving in for the kill.
With a start, Victor barks something into his walkie-
talkie and squeezes his way into the Quebradita crowd...
Cesar shoves Rita to the ground.

Rita looks at him like he's insane.
Cesar's entourage
gathers around them.
RITA
Yer crazy.
She turns her back and starts to leave.
Cesar grabs
her again...
CESAR
Don't turn yer back on me when
I'm talkin' t'you, bitch. You
think yer better than everybody
else. Well you ain't! You ain't

He grabs her blouse and rips it wide open. His eyes

good hand) square in the face. She crumbles to the
ground as Victor bursts through the crowd and
restrains Cesar.

Hesitating.
Turning to

TREVOR
(testing his patience)
What is it, Dave? How can I help
you?
Unintentionally in Trevor's face...
CHILDRESS
How 'bout a ride?
(taking a step back)
... The wife wouldn't let me drive
my own car. Ain't that a bitch?
Childress is pitiful. Wears a grease-stained tie with
his wrinkled Hawaiian shirt and a Windbreaker.
TREVOR
(with resignation)
... You smell like beer.

I only had two. That's all.
Swear ta Christ.
Raising his palms. Surrendering.

Strictly low rent district. The small dirt yard in front
is contained within a cinder block wall.
Rita, back to her chola look, heavy makeup, black (right)
eye where Cesar punched her, watches her two younger
brothers as they fight over a toy truck. Her
three-year-old baby sister, Maricella (too big to be
carried) straddles her hip as Rita yells at the boys...
RITA
Be nice to your brother, Antonio.
Don't make me go get Mommie.
Trevor's car pulls up.
Rita's taken aback.
RITA
(setting Maricella
down)
Go play wit' your brothers.
Rita attempts to thwart him at the sidewalk.

RITA

No way. Forget it. I can't.
What's wrong wit' you.
Trevor really does looks like hell.
TREVOR
(beseeching her)
Cesar and Stevie won't bother you.
That's a promise.
Something stirs deep inside her.
RITA
(struggles with it)
Why'd they have to kill Snowball?
TREVOR
... They didn't.
RITA
(on the verge of
tears now)
What's it fuckin' matter?! 'At
school shit's for other kids, not
me!
TREVOR
That's not true. You're so smart,
Rita. Don't you know that? You
have an opportunity here to change
your life. Please don't throw
away everything we've worked for.
Trevor just stares at her, incredulously.
Rita lowers her gaze, unable to look him in the eye.
Momentous deliberation, and now...
TREVOR
I know what happened with Childress.

eyebrows)

TREVOR
Doesn't matter.
RITA
He ain't never touched me no ways.
What's he sayin'? He say he
fucked me?! He say dat?!
(off Trevor's look)
He's a damn liar!
(erupting again;
tears streaming
down her face)
Get the fuck outta here! I don't

TREVOR

But I need you, Rita.

You made a mistake.
Dat's all.
With that Rita scoops up Maricella and exits.

Rivetted. Now he slides the cardboard box, along with
his briefcase onto the front seat.
Suddenly, as if out of nowhere, Ellen pulls up in her
Cherokee.
She deciphers Trevor with mixed emotions.
Trevor adjusts
his stance, covering the "187."
Ellen now tentatively rolls her window down halfway...
TAILPIPE SPUTTERS, a portentous idle.
ELLEN
(stilted)
... I'd like to apologize for
the other night.
Trevor stands there transfixed for a moment.
Now he
looks into her eyes. A soulful gaze.
TREVOR
Shouldn't listen to me.
I was
half asleep.
His eyes become damp.
Trevor smiles bravely.
ELLEN
We really need to talk.
TREVOR
... Not tonight. Have to finish

ELLEN
Tomorrow then?
It's important
