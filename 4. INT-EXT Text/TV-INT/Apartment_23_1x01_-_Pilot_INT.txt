      A WOMAN (mid-20's, big city beautiful) opens the door to her 
      darkened apartment.  

                                  WOMAN (V.O.)
                    Living in New York has taught me 
                    that life is full of surprises.  
                    They can be scary, but if you re 
                    open to them, they can also change 
                    your life.

      She sees something O.S. and stops.

                                  WOMAN
                          (surprised)
                    Steven.

      A man, STEVEN, sits on the couch.  Champagne chills in an ice 
      bucket, a gorgeous cake sits on a table next to a dozen red 
      roses, lit candles are everywhere. 

                                  STEVEN
                    Chloe.

      A beat, then the Woman (CHLOE) smiles sexily.

                                  CHLOE
                    I knew this was going to happen.

                                  STEVEN
                          (beat)
                    So did I.

      They attack each other and begin furiously making out.  

      IN A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

      -- They GUZZLE CHAMPAGNE as they tongue wrestle.

      -- KNOCK OVER FURNITURE as they rip off each other s clothes.

      -- CHLOE S ASS SMUSHES INTO THE CAKE as they have sex on it.  
      She pummels him with the roses as they pound, petals flying.  

      Suddenly, the door of the apartment opens again and the 
      lights CLICK ON.  A SECOND WOMAN (also mid-20's) stands in 
      the doorway.  Shocked, she lets out a blood-curdling scream!  

      And now, for the first time, we can clearly see the room.  A 
       Happy Birthday  banner hangs from the ceiling.  Wrapped 
      presents are scattered on the floor.                                                                                        2.


      On the mashed cake, around Chloe s ass cheeks, we can make 
      out the words 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY JUNE'.

                                  SECOND WOMAN
                    What the hell is going on?!

      As Steven scrambles to pull his pants up:

                                  STEVEN
                    June, I can explain--

                                  CHLOE
                    No, Steven.  Let me.
                          (deep breath)
                    June, sweetie, I fucked your fianc  
                    on your birthday cake.  And I m 
                    going to be late with my half of 
                    the rent.

      FREEZE FRAME on June s stunned face.  It was HER VOICE we 
      heard at the top of the show.

                                  JUNE (V.O.)
                    That s right.  My roommate slept 
                    with my fianc  on my birthday cake.
                          (beat)
                    And it was the best thing that ever 
                    happened to me.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      The empty apartment is incredible.  Hardwood floors, vaulted 
      ceilings, amazing views.  A DOORMAN opens the front door and 
      steps aside, REVEALING a wide-eyed June holding a suitcase.

      She walks over to the huge bay windows overlooking the city.  

                                  JUNE
                    New York City... have you ever seen 
                    anything this beautiful??

                    This morning I saw two homeless 
                    guys sharing a dead cat.

      She takes a camera out of her bag.

                                  JUNE
                    I have to take a picture for my 
                    parents.  They won t believe it.  


      June s MOM and DAD talk to CAMERA.

                                  MOM
                    I m so excited for you, living your

                    is over four dollars a loaf, don t 
                    buy bread, I will send you bread!

                                  DAD

      June and the Doorman are as we left them.

                                  JUNE
                    My parents are so proud.                                                                                      4.

                    Mine drank heavily and favored my 
                    sister.

      A giddy June walks through the apartment, taking it all in.

                                  JUNE
                    Wait until Steven sees this place!  
                    His head will explode!  He s my 
                    fianc .  He s getting his master s 
                    in behavioral psychology.


      Steven (in a white lab coat) stands in the FOREGROUND.  In 
      the BACKGROUND a morose 13-year-old kid, JEREMY, sits at a 
      table, constructing something.  Steven talks to CAMERA.

                                  STEVEN
                    Once I m done with my thesis 
                    project, I ll join you in New York 
                    and we ll get married.  I ll be

                    I made a cat out of pipe cleaners.

                          (calling back)
                    Excellent Jeremy, you ve earned one 
                    song during lunch.  Any song you 
                    want.  Any Josh Groban song you

                                  JUNE
                    I know what you re thinking.  How

                                    DOORMAN
                    I know the feeling.  I wanted to be 
                    a doorman by the time I was 51.  

      June looks around, amazed.  

                                  JUNE
                    All my hard work and dedication is

      Ding!  The elevator doors open and June steps out, box of 
      personal items in her hands, big smile on her face.  

      JUNE S POV: it's total chaos.  People run through SCREAMING, 
      setting fire to files, smashing computer hard drives... 

                                  JUNE
                    What... what s going on?

      A guy, MARK, stands at a nearby desk, shredding documents.

                                  MARK
                    We ve been shut down.  The 
                      government froze all our assets.

                    What?

                                  MARK
                      Apparently, Mr. Buchwald s been 
                      embezzling investors out of 
                    billions of dollars.  The police 
                    are looking for him right now.

      WHIP PAN TO: an empty corner office.  TWO POLICEMEN question 
      an assistant.

                                  POLICEMAN
                    Where s Buchwald?

      A guy holding a water bottle over his shoulder walks by.  He 
      has a cap pulled down low over his eyes.  The Policeman 
      removes the cap REVEALING an ELDERLY GENTLEMAN.  They grab 
      him and drag him out.                                                                                        6.


                                  MR. BUCHWALD
                    NO!  NO!  I work for Sparkletts!  
                    My name is Chad!


      Massive looting.  People grab cases of soda, bags of snacks, 
      coffee filters, etc.  Mark enters, followed by June.

                                  JUNE
                    You don t understand.  I moved all 
                    the way from Indiana for this job! 

                                  MARK
                    Oh, you re June Colbern.  Mark 
                    Reynolds.  I would ve been your 
                    associate mentor.  

      He starts shoving bagels down his pants.  

                                  MARK
                    A little advice?  Take whatever you 
                    can carry and get out of here.

      The EMERGENCY ALARM sounds as the SPRINKLER SYSTEM goes off.

                                  MARK
                    I said grab the big peanut butter 
                    and run!

      The Policemen drag Mr. Buchwald through.  He calls out.

                                  MR. BUCHWALD
                    MAIL MY JEWELRY TO RUSSIA!!


        A shell-shocked June sits at a table, a small coffee cup in 
      front of her.  A MAN approaches.

                                  MAN
                    Excuse me.  You can t squat here.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL she s surrounded by all her possessions 
      (boxes, dresser, lamps...). 

                                  JUNE
                    I am not squatting!  I ordered a 
                    small coffee!  They said I could 
                    sit here if I ordered a small 
                    coffee!

                                  MAN
                    June?  It s me, Mark!

      He sits down and shows her his nametag. 

                                  MARK
                    I just got hired as the manager 
                    here.  It s not ideal, but in these 
                    tough times you gotta do what you 
                    gotta do, right?

                                  JUNE
                    Right.  Meanwhile, I m doing great.  
                    Great might not be the best word.  
                    But I m fine.  Not fine, but... I 
                    have a plan.    

                                  MARK
                    Good, because your dresser is 
                    blocking the emergency exit.                                                                                      8.


                                  JUNE
                    Of course, the plan doesn t involve 
                    going home and telling my parents 
                    I m a failure.  They spent every 
                    penny they had putting me through 
                    graduate school.  My little sister 
                    had to wait to get braces.  

      She pulls a picture out of her wallet and shows it to him.  

                                  MARK

                    Oh god!  Is that the front of her??

                    Can you believe I m a grandmother?  
                    Feel my thighs.  Taut.  Ropey.  
                    Madonna ropey.  

      -- A MAN with a neckbeard wears a t-shirt that reads  My 
      Other Ride is Your Face .  He talks to CAMERA.

                                    T-SHIRT MAN
                    I don t enjoy rude women, loud 
                    women, talky women or redheads.  We 
                    may or may not become lovers, that 
                    is up to you.


      It s CHLOE.  She drinks a Cosmo as she talks to CAMERA.

                                  CHLOE
                    My last roommate moved out after 
                    four years to get married.  We were 
                    best friends, really.  Sisters.  
                    That kind of connection is so 
                      important, y know?  New York can be 
                    a scary, lonely place, especially 
                    when you first move here.
                          (offers plate)
                    Chicken satay?

      June sits on the couch, mesmerized.  She takes one.

                                  CHLOE
                    Top three things in my perfect day: 
                    chicken satay, Brazilian music and 
                    Baz Luhrmann movies.  And Prince 
                    Harry in my bed!  
                          (laughs)
                      I extended it!  I extended it to 
                    four things!

      June points to a framed photo on the coffee table.  

                                  JUNE
                    Is that a picture of Lance Bass?

                                  CHLOE
                    Ah yes.  Lancelot.  The Bass 
                    Master.  My best friend in the 
                    world.  Warning: he is not afraid 
                    of a fattening brunch.

                                  JUNE
                          (blurts it out)
                    You re fantastic!  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    10.

                                  JUNE (cont'd)
                    You re fantastic and you re 
                    drinking a pink drink and I want to 
                    live here!  

                                  CHLOE
                          (laughs)
                    I m guessing you haven t been in 
                    New York long?

                                  JUNE
                    Long enough to lose my job and my 
                      apartment.  But don t let that 
                    scare you, I am super-responsible.    

                                  CHLOE
                    I don t know... I m a trusting 
                    person, but I don t want to get 
                    taken.
                          (sizes her up, then)
                    Okay.  But it ll be first, last and 
                    security to move in.

                                  JUNE
                    Yes!  Absolutely!  It s all the 
                    money I have in the world, but take 
                    it!  Thank you!

      June pulls Chloe into a tight hug.

                                  JUNE
                          (quiet)
                    A lady made me feel her thigh.

                                  CHLOE
                    That ll happen.


      A happy June steps out of the elevators, keys in hand.

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Psst!

      June looks over and sees a WOMAN standing in an apartment 
      doorway.  She gestures vigorously for June to approach.

                                  WOMAN
                    Psst!

      June cautiously makes her way towards her.

                                  WOMAN
                    You here for the roommate posting?                                                                                    11.


                                  JUNE
                          (unsure)
                    Yeah...

                                  WOMAN
                    Don t trust the bitch in apartment 
                    23.

      Slam!  She shuts the door in June's face.  June knocks.

                                  JUNE
                    What was that?  Hello?  What did 
                    you-- hello?

      There s an OMINOUS MUSIC STING as we come to the...

                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    12.


                                        ACT TWO


      Boxes and furniture are stacked around.  June writes her name 
      on a carton of milk, cell phone to her ear.  After a beat:   

                                  JUNE
                    Hi Steven, it s me.  You won t 
                    believe what s happened.  Call me.  
                    I love you. 

      She hangs up and puts the milk carton in the fridge.

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    Hello, neighbor.

      June looks out the window and sees a GUY in a window of the 
      apartment building across the alley.  He s cute, dressed 
      preppy, very  boy next door .  He holds a mug of coffee.

                                  ELI
                    I m Eli.

                                  JUNE
                    Hi, I m June.  I just moved in.

                                  ELI
                    I know.  That fudge on your 
                    doorstep was from me.

                                  JUNE
                    Oh, thank you!  It was brown and 
                    unmarked so I threw it away, but 
                    still, that s so nice!

                                  ELI
                    Just my way of saying welcome.  
                          (then)
                    You must be hot from carrying all 
                    those boxes, huh?  Pretty sweaty?

                                  JUNE
                    I guess I m a little sore.

                                  ELI
                    Yeah.  Sore.

      We notice his SHOULDER WORKING IN A RHYTHMIC MANNER.  His 
      free hand is not visible below the window frame.  

                                  JUNE
                    What are you doing?                                                                                    13.


                                  ELI
                    ...mmm, so sore... 

      His shoulder speeds up.  He spills a little coffee.

                                  JUNE
                    Oh my god-- are you?  What-- no!  
                    Stop it!  I m calling the police!

      June grabs her phone as Chloe emerges from her bedroom, 
      COMPLETELY NAKED (her naughty areas are fuzzed out).

                                  CHLOE
                    What s up?

                                  JUNE
                    Put on a towel!  There s a pervert--

                                  CHLOE
                    Hey, Eli.

                                  ELI
                    ...hang on...
                          (long beat, then)
                    Hey, Chloe.

                                  JUNE
                    You know that guy?!

                                  CHLOE
                    We re old friends.  He shut down an 
                      underground sushi bar I worked at.

                                  ELI
                    Health inspector.  Too much rat 
                    feces.

      Chloe opens the fridge and takes out a Yoplait that has 
       June  clearly written across it.

                                  JUNE
                    Um, sorry, but that s mine.  I 
                    thought I would put my name on my 
                    items to avoid confusion.

      ANGLE INSIDE: the fridge.  Everything has  June  written on 
      it except a bottle of hot sauce and a L eggs container.

                                  CHLOE
                    Oh.  Sorry.  

      She puts the yogurt back in the fridge.  Meanwhile, Eli 
      pounds a large bottle of water.                                                                                    14.


                                  ELI
                          (re: bottle, explaining)
                    Fluids.

      June shoots him a look.  Chloe hops up and sits bare-assed on 
      the counter. 

                                  JUNE
                          (horrified, to herself)
                    That s where I was going to make 
                      sandwiches...
                          (then)
                    Hey, so something weird happened to 
                    me today.  A woman on the first 
                    floor warned me not to trust you.

                                  CHLOE
                    Oh, that s Robin.  She s in love 
                    with me.  We met on a Fat Joe video 
                    shoot.  She was the p.a. in charge 
                    of spraying champagne on my butt.


      HIP-HOP MUSIC plays as hot girls in bikinis, including Chloe, 
      gyrate against a Bentley.  CHAMPAGNE SPRAY erupts from off-
      screen and onto Chloe s butt.  

      REVEAL: Robin, standing next to a cameraman, shaking and 
      spraying a bottle of champagne with gusto.

                                  ROBIN
                    Oh yeah!  I m aroused and confused!


      June and Chloe are as we left them.

                                  CHLOE
                    Robin wanted to be my new roommate 
                    so she s probably jealous of you.  
                      I wouldn t worry about it.  Just 
                    don t use the stairwell at night.
                          (leans in, ominous)
                    That s where she excels.

      She walks off.  June stares after her, a bit unsure.


      June is asleep in bed when the door to her room bursts open, 
      revealing a STRANGE MAN.  June bolts awake and screams!                                                                                      15.


      The guy is unfazed (and, we now see, wearing a tuxedo) as he 
      wobbles to a corner, unzips his fly and PEES on some clothes.

                                  JUNE
                    My jeans!  


      June walks out to find a drunk Chloe on the couch, holding a 
      glass of champagne and making out with a SECOND GUY in a tux.  
      The first guy stumbles out of her room, zipping up his pants.  

                                  CHLOE
                    Oh, hey roomie!
                          (re: extra guy)
                    I brought you home a doggie bag.  
                    Guess my eyes were bigger than my--

                                  JUNE
                    No!  Thank you!  Your  friend  just 
                    peed in my bedroom!

                                  CHLOE
                          (to guy, admonishing)
                    Bad!  Bad... extra man!  
                          (to June)
                    Are you sure you won t join us for 
                    a little four-way action? 
                          (leans in, whispers)
                    Take off your pants.  I gave 
                      assurances.   

                                  ELI (O.S.)
                    I support that idea wholeheartedly! 

                                  JUNE
                          (shouts)
                    No, and stop peeping-toming us!
                          (to Chloe)
                    One, I m engaged, and two, I have 
                    job interviews tomorrow.

      June grabs cleaning spray, kitchen gloves and paper towels 
      and exits back into her room, locking the door behind her. 

                                  CHLOE
                    You sure?!  The one with the hair-
                    lip claims to be royalty!

      Chloe takes a sip of champagne, bored, as one of the drunk 
      guys kisses her neck.  She picks up her phone and dials.                                                                                    16.


                                  CHLOE
                          (into phone)
                    Hey dung puncher.

      SPLIT SCREEN WITH:


      LANCE BASS sits on his couch, in the same pose as Chloe, 
      drinking a PomAde.  A HOT DUDE kisses his neck. 

                                  LANCE

      June stands next to a MANAGER, who looks over her resum .  
      Through the windows in the DEEP BACKGROUND we see day-
      laborers outside, trying to flag down passing customers.                                                                                    18.

      Steven stands in the FOREGROUND, wearing a white lab coat and

      helmet, hovering in the air above a vertical wind tunnel.

      throws open the door.  She carries an expensive purse.

                    time talking to the woman.  In 
                    Middle Eastern culture, the man of 
                    the house makes the rules.  

                                  JUNE
                    What are you-- no, don t--!

      Chloe strides over to the Old Man and sits on his lap.  She 
      unbuttons his shirt and twirls one of his grey chest hairs 
      around her finger.                                                                                    26.


                                  CHLOE
                    Hello, papa.  Guess who wandered 
                    into your frosty forest, ready to 
                    whisper wicked promises? 

                                  OLD MAN
                    Hachmon dadi!

      Mrs. Yilmaz re-enters and sees Chloe sitting on the old man.

                                  MRS. YILMAZ
                    What are you doing?!

                                  CHLOE
                    Going over your head and dealing 
                    with the patriarch of the family.  

                                  MRS. YILMAZ
                    That s our neighbor.  He comes over 
                    to watch The Weather Channel.

                                  OLD MAN
                    Hachmon dadi!

      This time a SUBTITLE reads:  There s a storm front coming!   
      Mrs. Yilmaz grabs Chloe and June and leads them to the door. 

                                  MRS. YILMAZ
                    Get out. 

                                  JUNE
                    Look, yes, Chloe is screwed up!  
                    But she didn t start out that way!  
                    She was a child once, a normal 
                    human being before she got seduced 
                    by the dark side.  This ottoman is 
                    from a time in her life when she 
                    could still care about something.  
                    Don t take away the one connection 
                    she still has to her humanity.

      Chloe listens to June, taken aback.  A beat, then:

                                  JUNE
                    If you do, the crazy bitch will 
                    seduce your son and replace his 
                    virginity with a Mexican rash.  

      The family looks at Chloe, horrified.  She nods.

                                  CHLOE
                    I will.  I ll toss my Valtrex and 
                    let it flare up, so help me God.                                                                                    27.



      June and Chloe enter, laughing, carrying the ottoman.  A 
      relieved Lance is there to greet them.

                                  LANCE
                    Oh thank god, you got it back!

                                  CHLOE
                    June did it, she was genius!  
                          (to June, sincere)
                    What you said back there, after all 
                    the mean things I ve done... I 
                    really appreciate it.  Thank you.  

      June smiles at her.  A beat... then Chloe pops a switchblade 
      and slices open the ottoman cushion.  

                                  JUNE
                          (shocked)
                    What are you doing?

      She removes a HUGE BAG OF PILLS. 

                                  LANCE
                    Oh, good.  I loaned her a thousand 
                    dollars to buy those.

                    Wait, so that whole story about 
                    your great-grandmother was a lie?!

                                  CHLOE
                    Oh no, that was true.  You can love 
                    grandma s ottoman and still want to 
                    make some money on pills.  These 
                    things are not mutually exclusive.

                                  JUNE
                    I ve paid for drugs!  I have paid 
                    for drugs!  You ve made me an 
                      accomplice in drugs!  

                                  CHLOE
                    I sell them and give the money to 
                    charity.
                          (beat, then confessing)
                    No, I don t do that.                                                                                    28.

                    I can t believe you!  Just stay the 
                    hell out of my life!

      She grabs her purse and throws open the front door, REVEALING 
      Steven and Jeremy.

                                  JUNE
                    Steven!  

                                  STEVEN
                    June-bug!

                    Oh my god, what re you doing here?

                                  STEVEN
                    We kept missing each other and your 
                      birthday s in a few days, so I flew 
                    out to surprise you!

                                  JEREMY
                    Can I have a snack?

                                  STEVEN
                    I had to bring Jeremy, of course.  
                    He must be under constant 
                      observation.  

                                  JEREMY
                    Something salty.  Like peanuts.

                                  STEVEN
                    Make a note of that in the cravings 
                    journal.

      He steps aside REVEALING a WOMAN (pretty, 20 s) behind him.  
      She scribbles down something in a journal.

                                  JUNE
                    Who is this now?

                                  STEVEN
                    Jeremy s traveling nurse, Nicole.  
                    She s here to monitor him when I 
                    can t, so you and I can spend some 
                    alone time together.

                                  NICOLE
                    I ve never been to New York! 

      Chloe and Lance exchange a look.  Steven smiles at Chloe.                                                                                    29.


                                  STEVEN
                    Is this your roommate?

                                  JUNE
                    Oh yes, I m sorry, how rude of me.  
                    Everyone, this is Chloe, the bitch 
                    in apartment 23.

      An uncomfortable beat.  Chloe holds out the bag of drugs.  

                                  CHLOE
                          (offering)
                    Anyone want to get weird and play 
                    Mario Kart?


      Jeremy sits on the taped-up ottoman, playing a hand-held 
      video game.  Chloe enters through the front door.

                                  CHLOE
                    Hello, little freak Steven is 
                    watching.  Where is everyone?

                                  JEREMY
                    June s at work and Dr. Clayton and 
                    Nurse Nicole are in a meeting.

                                  CHLOE
                    What?  I thought the whole reason 
                    she came was so you d be constantly 
                      monitored.

                                  JEREMY
                          (shrugs)
                      Monitored?  I don t know.  The only 
                    reason I do this is to get out of 
                    Boy Scouts.

                    Hey, you know what s fun?  Drinking 
                    alcohol.


      Jeremy takes a swig off a beer bottle.  He s shit-faced.

                                  JEREMY
                    Oh yeah, they re doing it.  They ve 
                    been doing it for so long.
                          (takes a swig)

                                  JEREMY (cont'd)
                    He s also banging Nurse Simone, 
                    Physical Therapist Sheila and that 
                    girl with the limp who sells car 
                      insurance.

      Jeremy vomits on himself, then closes his eyes and falls 
      asleep.  Chloe turns and sees Eli standing in his window.  

                                  ELI
                    Know what I like best about you?

                    You never let anyone get away with 
                    anything.  Find June and tell her 
                    about this scum-bag.

                    But first, could you walk on some 
                    bubble wrap in high heels?  I have 
                    to keep pushing the envelope.


      June (in Starbucks apron) restocks bagels.  Mark walks over. 

                                  MARK
                    If we get fired from here I m 
                    shoving those down my pants.

       June laughs but stops abruptly when Chloe and Lance enter.  

                                  JUNE
                    You ve got to be kidding me.

                    fired someone for no reason so I 
                    could hire a friend.  No big deal.   

      June angrily begins restocking biscotti on the shelves.                                                                                    31.

      She storms out.  Lance turns to June.

                                  LANCE
                    I know you re upset, but Chloe s 
                    just trying to do the right thing.  
                    She may have the morals of a pirate 
                    but she d do anything for her 
                    friends.  Like the time she pushed

        A frustrated Chloe enters to find Steven sitting on the 
      couch.  A  Happy Birthday  banner hangs from the ceiling (the 
      apartment looks the way it does at the top of the show).                                                                                      32.

      A beat, as we see Chloe thinking, formulating a plan...  She 
      smiles sexily.  

                                  CHLOE
                    I knew this would happen.

      The scene FAST-FORWARDS through what we ve already seen in 
      the cold open, ending on the FREEZE FRAME on June s face. 

                                  JUNE (V.O.)
                    And I believe this is where we came 
                    in.

      The scene UNFREEZES and resumes.  Steven points at Chloe.

                                  STEVEN
                    She seduced me!

                                  CHLOE
                    To prove to you he s a cheater!

                                  JUNE
                          (reeling)
                    No, I don t-- I m not--

      Nurse Nicole and Jeremy approach from the hallway behind her.  

                                  NICOLE
                    What the hell is going on here?!

                                  STEVEN
                          (warning)
                    Nicole...

                                  NICOLE
                    I knew you were cheating on--
                          (indicates June)
                    --her with me, but you re cheating 
                    on me with--
                          (indicates Chloe)
                    --her??  I thought I was your only 
                    mistress, you son of a bitch!

                                  CHLOE
                    Ask him about the girl who sells 
                    car insurance.                                                                                    33.


                                  NICOLE
                    My sister?!

      She launches a lamp at Steven s head.  June runs out.  Jeremy 
      reaches for another beer.  Chloe stops him.

                                  CHLOE
                    You re okay.


      June sits alone at the bar.  Chloe sits down next to her.

                                  CHLOE
                    I knew the only way you would 
                    believe Steven was a bad dude was 
                    to literally walk in on him in the 
                    worst scenario possible -- having 
                    sex with your roommate on your 
                    birthday cake.

                                  JUNE
                          (beat)
                    That s the nicest thing anyone s 
                    ever done for me.
                          (breaking down)
                    How sad is that?!

      Chloe places a comforting hand on June s shoulder.

                                  JUNE
                    If you hadn t stepped in, I 
                    probably wouldn t have found out 
                    for another 10 years.  I d be 
                    divorced with two kids... I d be 
                    fat, I m sure I d be fat... you 
                    saved me from wasting the best 
                    years of my life.

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah, well, it came at a price.  I 
                    got a lot of frosting in my crack.

                                  JUNE
                          (beat, then realizing)
                    Oh, the cake...

                                  CHLOE
                    Yes.  I don t know why I brought it 
                    up.  I guess genuine emotion makes 
                    me very uncomfortable. 
                          (calling)
                      Bartender!  Kamikaze shots!                                                                                    34.


      The bartender sets down two shots.  Chloe raises her glass. 

                                  CHLOE
                    Happy birthday.

                                  JUNE
                    Happy birthday?  I just broke up 
                    with my fianc , I have a crap job, 
                    I'm $100,000 in debt from student 
                    loans, I'm lying to my parents and 
                    I have a psycho for a roommate.

                                  CHLOE
                    But on the upside, I m stealing 
                    cable.  You do get free cable.  

      June smiles.  She raises her glass.  They clink and down 
      their shots.

                                  CHLOE
                    Come on, let s go home.

      They get up and head out.

                                  JUNE
                    Did we pay for those drinks?

                                  CHLOE
                    No, hard times, keep walking.

                                                                        FADE OUT: 
                                        END OF SHOW
