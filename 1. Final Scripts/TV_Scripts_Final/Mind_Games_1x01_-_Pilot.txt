                                            TEASER

    INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

    ROSS, early 40 s, handsome, sleeps across a largely torn apart 
    bed next to STACY, 30 s, beautiful. A phone BUZZES repeatedly. 

                                ROSS
                  If you get calls at this hour, I don t 
                  think this is going to work.

                                STACY
                  It s yours. And this is like the fifth 
                  time.

    A beat and then Ross bolts up in bed.

                                ROSS
                  Hand it to me, hand it to me. 
                        (as he grabs for it)
                  Don t say anything. 

                                STACY
                  You said you were divorced.

                                ROSS
                  I am. I m afraid it might be my parole 
                  officer.

                                STACY
                  Parole officer?

    He gestures to silence her and then - 

                                ROSS
                        (casual)
                  Hello?

    INT. EDWARDS & ASSOCIATES OFFICE - INTERCUT

    CLARK, late 30 s, manic, pushes a heavy, modern looking couch 
    through the office. He talks fast, like the words need out.

                                CLARK
                  Where the hell are you? We were 
                  supposed to meet an hour ago. We-

    As Clark goes on Ross looks at Stacy, relieved.

                                ROSS
                  It s just my brother.

    She moves warily into the bathroom, not nearly as relieved. As 
    Clark GRINDS the couch across the floor-

                                CLARK
                  This is important and obviously 
                  difficult for me, Ross, and I mapped 
                  out a whole new strategy and you 
                  promised that before we went in-                                                                                      2.

                                ROSS
                  Clark. Clark. What is that noise?

                                CLARK
                  It s the furniture. The furniture has 
                  been arranged very confrontationally, 
                  okay? I don t know how I didn t pick 
                  up on it before. That s on me. But, 
                  it s absolutely costing us business. 
                  All these tables- 

                                ROSS
                  You re at the office?

                                CLARK
                  Yes.

                                ROSS
                  You slept there?

                                CLARK
                  Oh no. I haven t slept.

                                ROSS
                  Clark-

                                CLARK
                  I know! I m on top of it. I did a full 
                  self assessment and in addition to the 
                  furniture issues, I ve realized we re 
                  a person short. We need another 
                  person. I need another person. I ve 
                  hired another person. And we should 
                  talk before-   

                                ROSS
                  Clark, you do realize we can t pay the 
                  people we already have, right?

    Stacy peeks tentatively out of the bathroom.

                                STACY
                  Exactly what sort of parole are we 
                  talking about? 

                                ROSS
                  Strictly white collar. Seriously, you 
                  can come out. I was barely even in 
                  prison.

                                STACY
                  Prison.

    She goes back into the bathroom and closes the door.

                                ROSS
                        (to Clark)
                  Look, I m on my way. Stop moving 
                  things, okay?

                                CLARK
                  Yes. Fine. Wait. Ross?                                                                                      3.

    CONTINUED: (2)

                                ROSS
                  Yeah.

                                CLARK
                  I m gonna keep moving the furniture. I 
                  don t know why I said I d stop. 

                                ROSS
                  I ll be there in ten minutes.

    Ross hangs up, starts to dress.

                                STACY (O.S.)
                        (from the bathroom)
                  You said you were an architect.

                                ROSS
                  Technically, you said you were an 
                  architect first.

                                STACY
                          (stepping out)
                  That s because I AM an architect.

                                ROSS
                  Right. And then I said I was an 
                  architect because when people discover 
                  they suddenly have something in common 
                  they immediately feel more at ease and 
                  less like strangers. It s part of this 
                  process called  mirroring ?

                                STACY
                   Process ? 

                                ROSS
                  Like a way to make people feel more 
                    comfortable and... connected.

                                STACY
                  By lying?

                                ROSS
                   Mirroring .

                                STACY
                  I missed the difference.

                                ROSS
                  Well, it s a... science thing.

                                STACY
                  Did you really go to NYU?

                                ROSS
                  I... no. I mean I went to college. 
                  Just not that one.

                                STACY
                  Is Hud really your favorite movie?                                                                                      4.

                                ROSS
                  I haven t actually seen it, but I 
                  youtubed the fifty eggs scene while 
                  you were in the bathroom last night 
                  and just based on that, yeah, I think 
                  it s safe to put it near the top of 
                  the list.

                                STACY
                  Your secret love of Taylor Swift 
                  music?

    Ross just CRINGES and shakes his head as he finishes dressing, 
    moves toward the door.

                                STACY
                  My God, are you really even divorced?

                                ROSS
                  Yes. Very yes. I am SUPER divorced. 
                  Honestly, it still feels good just to 
                  say it out loud.

                                STACY
                  Did you just use the word  honestly ?

                                ROSS
                  Look, I know it sounds a little 
                  strange, but it s a technique -

                                STACY
                  Oh, well if it s a technique-

                                ROSS
                  - we use in this new business I 
                  started with my brother who s like a 
                  genius with psychology and honestly- 

                                STACY
                  You did it again.

                                ROSS
                  - it s all very new to me and I just 
                  didn t realize it would be this... 
                  effective. I swear I wasn t aiming any 
                  higher than getting your number. YOU 
                  asked ME to come home with you, 
                  remember?

    She does remember. They stop in the doorway. One more chance.

                                STACY
                  Is your name really Royce?

                        (cringing)
                  It s Ross.

    Her expression goes flat. Off the door SLAMMING in his face-

    INT. CAR - MORNING

    Ross and Clark whip into a parking space.                                                                                      5.

                  We lead with our weaknesses.

                                ROSS
                  This is your new strategy? You 
                  understand that this is the last 
                  investor willing to talk to us? That 
                  Latrell worked this guy s assistant 
                  for a month to get us this meeting? 

    EXT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

    As they get out of the car-

                                CLARK
                  I understand those things so well I 
                  was actually at the office at the 
                  agreed upon time.

                                ROSS
                  In a way my absence is directly 
                  attributable to you.

                                CLARK
                  I never remotely suggested you use the 
                  research to pick up women.

                                ROSS
                  You should have. 
                          (dawning)
                  God, maybe that s what we should be 
                  selling.

    As Clark walks and talks FAST Ross struggles to keep up.

                                CLARK
                  The studies show you re judged to be 
                  more likable if you begin by admitting 
                  to your faults rather than waiting. In 
                  fact, it actually makes you more 
                  likable than someone with no faults at 
                  all. We d be better off making up 
                  things to admit to than appearing to 
                  be perfect.

                                ROSS
                  I highly doubt we have to worry about 
                  appearing perfect.
                        (grabs, stops Clark)
                  Are we racing?

                                CLARK
                  I m excited. 

                                ROSS
                  Is there an excitement level just 
                  below jogging into the meeting?

                                CLARK
                  I m not jogging. This is jogging.

    Before he can begin actually jogging, Ross grabs him.                                                                                      6.

                  Well, I wasn t sleeping, so it didn t 
                  make sense to-

                                ROSS
                  You know what I mean.

                                CLARK
                  There s still a lot of Beth s stuff 
                  there, and I can t get rid of it 
                  because I m not ready to get rid of it 
                  but I can t be around it-

                                ROSS
                  Clark, you ve got to stop this. She 
                  was just some girl. You ve had other-

                                CLARK
                  No. No, not like this, not like-
                        (quick beat)
                  You re killing my mojo here, Ross. 
                  This is killing it. So let s do this 
                  later because right now I m ready to 
                  shake the money tree. I m ready to 
                  dominate. Can we go dominate? Let s go 
                  dominate.

    Clark heads in. Ross stands, concerned.

                                ROSS
                  Is there a level just below dominate?

    INT. HIGH RISE - WINDOW OFFICE

    Clark and Ross sit across from TED SANDERS, late 50 s, 
    balding, short, busy. Ross leads. Clark vibrates. 

                                ROSS
                  In 2008 a group of psychologists 
                  decided to see if instead of just 
                  observing people in the lab, they 
                  could use what they d learned to 
                  actually manipulate them in the real 
                  world. Specifically, they decided to 
                  see if they could influence an 
                  election. So, the night before, in a 
                  few districts, they called voters from 
                  one party and instead of just asking 
                  IF they were going to vote, they asked 
                  WHEN, and then they asked what the 
                  person thought they d be doing just 
                  before they went to vote, a little 
                    psychological trick that their 
                  research showed would cause the voter 
                  to create an unconscious trigger in 
                  the following day that would remind 
                  them, oh yeah, this is when I m 
                  supposed to go vote. The results - 
                  were stunning.

                  Turnout from these specially scripted 
                  calls blew away traditional get out 
                  the vote calls, and just like that, it 
                  became very clear that in the right 
                  hands, these little observations about 
                  human nature that had just been lying 
                  around in academic journals could be 
                  turned into very powerful tools 
                  capable of doing nothing short of 
                  helping decide who became the next 
                  leader of the free world.

    Clark suddenly stands as if he can t take sitting anymore, 
    starts to move impatiently around the room like a boxer.

                                ROSS
                  And that got us thinking, what if 
                  instead of just trying to manipulate 
                  critical elections, you could use this 
                  vast body of knowledge to help people 
                  manipulate the most important moments 
                  in their lives. What if--   

    Clark can t take it. His words are unleashed in a torrent of 
    pressured speech as he wanders the room fondling Ted s things.

                                CLARK
                  What if, Ted, what if we started the 
                  way we agreed we were going to start, 
                  which was by saying that I m severely 
                  bipolar and my academic career 
                  recently imploded when the university 
                  became aware I was having an affair 
                  with a 22 year old undergraduate 
                  student. Also, Ross just finished a 
                  two year stint in a minimum security 
                  prison for fraud, so there s that. The 
                  point is we re not hiding anything, 
                  even though not leading with it, like 
                  we agreed to, makes it seem like we 
                  are, we re not, because we don t need 
                  to hide anything because this is an 
                  incredible opportunity. Sway the vote 
                  for the leader of the free world? 
                  Yeah, we can do that. That was my 
                  research. But maybe you don t want to 
                  get elected president. Maybe you just 
                  need help getting the job you always 
                  wanted? Or maybe you need to make sure 
                  your company is chosen for a billion 
                  dollar contract? Or that your daughter 
                  doesn t marry the dirtbag freeloading 
                  musician she s threatening to elope 
                  with. You want to play what if? What 
                  if, instead of leaving the big moments 
                  to fate, we could manipulate them with 
                  60 years worth of research into human 
                  behavior, stacking the deck in your 
                  favor, so that when it really, really 
                  mattered, you always came out on top? 

                                TED
                  You re offering me an alternative to 
                  fate? Sure, I ll take two.                                                                                      8.

    Clark SLAPS the desk, excited.

                                CLARK
                  There you go! Now we re cooking!

                        (trying to be calming)
                  Clark is a world renowned expert in 
                  the fields of human behavior, 
                    psychology, and motivation, and 
                  drawing from the most cutting edge 
                    psychological research he s able to 
                  tailor a plan to influence any 
                  situation so that at that critical, 
                  life altering moment-  

    Clark jumps in, unable to contain himself.

                                CLARK
                  Ted, you lost some kind of shareholder 
                  revolt you were trying to lead last 
                  year, right? We could have won that 
                  for you.  

                                TED
                  You could have constructed a better 
                  argument for replacing the board?

                                CLARK
                  No, I could have replaced the board 
                  without knowing anything about your 
                  argument. I saw clips of your 
                    presentation. Series A dividends? 
                  Hell, I don t know if that was a good 
                  argument. But I know you re short. And 
                  bald. And you sound a little 
                    effeminate. And pointy shoes make you 
                  look like an elf. I know you lost when 
                  you stood up on the far left side of 
                  the conference room. No one important 
                  is ever wearing pointy shoes on the 
                  far left side of a room, Ted. Ever.

                                TED
                  So you d have changed my shoes and the 
                  seating chart and I d have won.

                                CLARK
                  I d have primed your audience, Ted. 
                  Just like you did. Except you had them 
                  primed to ignore you. 
                        (very worked up)
                  Don t you get it Ted? This is how 
                  people work. We don t listen to each 
                  other. No one s listening to you. No 
                  one s listening to me. We don t hear! 
                  We react to a million little things we 
                  aren t even aware of. The brain s all 
                  jedi mind tricks and back doors and 
                  secret passageways and if you know 
                  about them-  Watch this. Watch. Okay-

    Clark suddenly GRINDS Ted s desk sideways, KNOCKING things off 
    before Ross leaps up to stop him. 

                                ROSS
                  Stop.

                                CLARK
                  Ross, we can assert his power with 
                  just his feet! I ll show you. Go find 
                  me a female. Any female. Watch this.

    He grabs at Ted s shoes while backing the desk up further.

                                ROSS
                  Clark! Stop!

    Suddenly Ted s shoes comes off, sending Clark into the desk 
    which goes over with a CRASH. Everyone stares. Long beat.

                                TED
                  Exactly how many fates would you say 
                  you two have altered so far?

                                ROSS
                  Well, we ve only been up and running 
                  for a couple of months but we ve 
                  managed to optimize several press 
                  releases and-

                                TED
                  Press releases.

                                ROSS
                  We re just beginning to educate people 
                  to the possibilities of what we can do 
                  and with an infusion of cash from you-

                                TED
                  Uh-huh. Look, I ll buy that there s 
                  some science to manipulating people- 

                                CLARK
                  You ll buy it? It s not something you 
                  buy. It s not optional. The science is 
                  bulletproof. The science is science.

                                TED
                  Then maybe the science isn t the 
                  reason you re not getting any 
                  business.

                                CLARK
                  What s that mean?
                        (to Ross)
                  What does he mean?

                                TED
                  What I mean is, maybe when someone s 
                  life altering moment arrives, a felon 
                  and someone too mentally unstable for 
                  academics aren t the people you want 
                  pulling strings on your behalf.                                                                                       10.

                  And in the real life, the guy you

                  call a cleaning crew when you finish

    Ross and Clark step off the elevators, arguing. As they walk-

                                ROSS
                  I m not saying all the time. I m 
                  saying occasionally. For important 
                  events. Like meetings with people who 
                  could help us pay for things like 
                    electricity and all the furniture you 
                  enjoy pushing around.

                                CLARK
                  Look, I had a strategy and you-

                                ROSS
                  Don t change the subject.

                                CLARK
                  I can t take the drugs, Ross! Because 
                  you know what it s like? It s like 
                  when you go for a jog with headphones 
                  on and great music playing and it s 
                  like life has a soundtrack and then 
                  you take the headphones off and 
                  suddenly it s just dull and flat. The 
                  drugs stop the music, and the music is 
                  where the ideas come from.

                                ROSS
                  I can think of several ideas we could 
                  have done without in that meeting.

    They reach offices next to each other. MILES, mid 20 s, geeky 
    handsome, and LATRELL, late 20 s, serious, step over.

                  Okay, yes, there s some bad with the 
                  good, but my condition correlates 
                  highly with creativity and some of the 
                  greatest minds in history have-

                                ROSS
                  We re not talking about history. We re 
                  talking about right now. This exact 
                  moment in time where we just wasted 
                  our best chance to-

                                  LATRELL
                  We didn t get it?

    As Clark walks into his office with Miles in tow-

                                CLARK
                  No, Latrell. I blew it. Is that what 
                  you wanted to hear, Ross?

                                ROSS
                  All I suggested was-

    Latrell grabs Ross before he can follow Clark into his office.                                                                                      12.

                  Hey. This is serious. 

                                ROSS
                  Does it seem like I m taking it 
                  lightly?

                                  LATRELL
                  I called every contact I had left and 
                    practically offered to mow their lawn 
                  to get you in there. Ted was our 
                  lifeboat.

                                ROSS
                  Then we ll just swim until we find 
                  another Ted. We have other-

                                  LATRELL
                  We have nothing. The landlord is ready 
                  to lock us out. I ve talked to every 
                  bank and investor with a phone. There 
                  are no other Teds coming. We needed

                  You were a very promising graduate 
                  student Miles. You shouldn t have 
                  followed me here.

                                MILES
                  I don t understand. The strategy 
                  didn t establish trust?

                  We didn t lead with it. And when I did

                                MILES
                  Did you talk about a dominance display

                                CLARK
                  I talked about a lot of things. I 
                  remember trying to take off his shoes.

                                MILES
                  Why would you-

                                CLARK
                  I was making a point about physical 
                    asynchronicity and power positions. I 
                  was going to demonstrate how putting 
                  his feet between himself and a female-

    BACK ON LATRELL AND ROSS

                                  LATRELL
                  You said you could control him.

                                ROSS
                  He s just in an up phase right now.

                                  LATRELL
                  And when will he come down?

                                ROSS
                  We don t want down.

                                  LATRELL
                  What do we want?

                                ROSS
                  Something in the middle. It s not an 
                  exact science. Look, try to remember, 
                  I m the one who found you. I saw you 
                  had talent when everyone else saw a 
                  kid with a record, bad grades, and no 
                  degree, and I gave you a shot.

                                  LATRELL
                  You set me up selling illegal 
                    investments out of a boiler room and 
                  you left in handcuffs! I m not 
                  interested in another shot like that.

                  Where were you last night?

                                ROSS
                  You re checking my place now?

                                  LATRELL
                  I was guessing. Apparently I was 
                  right. You haven t changed at all.

    Latrell walks away.

                                ROSS
                        (calling after Latrell)

    Suddenly MEGAN, early 20 s, knockout, steps over.

                  Morning.

    Megan stops everyone cold. Miles seems most excited.

                  Megan. I thought you weren t coming in 
                  until Thursday.

    Her eyes flick towards Ross, but only Clark seems to note it.

                                MEGAN
                  Right. I was just between auditions 
                  and thought maybe I d stop by. Try to 
                  learn a little more about the... 
                  science, or whatever, behind what you 
                  need me to do.

                  I know what you re trying, but that s 
                  not how you do it.

                                MILES
                  Really. It was declarative and I 
                  looked right at her eyes when-

    Suddenly Latrell steps back over. Quickly, shocked-

                                  LATRELL
                  There s... a woman here who says she 
                  wants to hire us.

    Surprised, they all look at each other for a beat. Then-

                  What are we waiting for? Let s go

    Clark moves toward the lobby with renewed vigor.

                  plant.

    INT. MEETING ROOM

    Clark and Ross sit in chairs at opposite RIGHT ANGLES from 
    SOPHIE, 40 s, and her son TYLER, 10. The effect is that she 
    has to look back and forth between the brothers.

                                SOPHIE
                  I don t even know if this is what you 
                  do. One of Tyler s doctors suggested 
                  maybe you could help. Dr. Allen? He 
                  said you used to be faculty at the 
                  same medical school. 

                                CLARK
                  Yes. I was let go for throwing my 
                  lunch at a class full of first years.

                                SOPHIE
                  He mentioned that.

                                CLARK
                  I was also recently let go from 
                  another institution for having an 
                  affair with an undergraduate. In my 
                  own defense I was deeply in love with 
                  her and felt like she understood and 
                  accepted me exactly as I am.

                                SOPHIE
                  O-kay.

    Clark shoots a leading glance at Ross. He SIGHS.

                                ROSS
                  I ve been convicted of securities 
                  fraud and spent two years in a minimum 
                  security prison. Would you like to 
                  hear about the time I accidentally 
                  drove off without paying for gas when 
                  I was 17? 

                                SOPHIE
                  Why are you telling me these things?

                                ROSS
                  That s such a good question.

                                CLARK
                  Because we want you to know we ve made 
                  mistakes, but we ve learned from them, 
                  and this is our chance to apply those 
                  lessons, and the expertise I ve gained 
                  through a lifetime of studying human 
                  behavior, study that s frankly been at 
                  least partly an effort to understand 
                  the difficulties I have controlling my 
                  own, and use that accumulated 
                  knowledge and experience to help 
                  people like yourself.                                                                                      16.

                  Where was that answer an hour ago?

                                CLARK
                  At the beginning of the meeting if 
                  you d stuck with the plan.
                        (to Sophie)
                  I m sorry, continue.

                                SOPHIE
                  Well, Tyler has a heart condition. It 
                  makes him very weak and requires 
                  invasive surgery to repair his valves 
                  almost every year. 

                                TYLER
                        (smiles weakly)
                  One more surgery and I ll have had as 
                  many broken ribs as Evel Knievel. 

    Clark cringes sympathetically at this thought.

                                SOPHIE
                  The doctors have offered a new 
                  permanent treatment that uses stem 
                  cells to help regrow the valves. But 
                  the insurance company is saying it s 
                  experimental and they won t pay for 
                  it. We ve already been bankrupted by 
                  Tyler s bills, so without the 
                  insurance we can t possibly afford the 
                  procedure and Tyler will just keep 
                  suffering through the surgeries.

    Ross appears to have heard only one word and his face falls.

                                ROSS
                    Bankrupted?

    Sophie nods. Ross is done, but Clark s pacing, intrigued.

                                CLARK
                  Who have you been talking to?

                                SOPHIE
                  Well, we ve worked our way up. I have 
                  a meeting scheduled with the head of 
                  the claims department tomorrow. 

                                CLARK
                  And he could approve the surgery?

                                SOPHIE
                  Yes.

                                CLARK
                  That s very good. What s he like? How 
                  educated is he? Is he aggressive? Do 
                  you have any pictures of his hands?                                                                                      17.

                  No... we ve only talked a few times. 
                  His name is Charles Murray. I don t 
                  know much else.

                                CLARK
                  That s okay. We ll pull together a 
                  full background and figure out-

                                ROSS
                  When exactly did you declare 
                    bankruptcy?

    He emphasizes it for Clark, who seems oblivious.

                                SOPHIE
                  About six weeks ago. I m sorry, I 
                  guess I don t fully understand what it 
                  is you do.

                                CLARK
                  What we do is research and deploy a 
                    psychological strategy to make sure 
                  the people who ve been telling you no 
                  decide to say yes. Simply put, we 
                  change their minds without them 
                  knowing we did it.

                                TYLER
                  Like jedi mind tricks.

                                CLARK
                  Exactly like jedi mind tricks! I just 
                  said that to someone this morning. 
                  Ross, didn t I say that? 

                                ROSS
                  Yes. It went over really well.

                                CLARK
                  See, in your case we ve just got to 
                  change one man s mind, that s called a 
                  single point of influence, and there s 
                  a number of strategies that might 
                  work. You said you re meeting tomorrow-

                                ROSS
                  You know what? Before we get too far, 
                  let us jump into a meeting. We ll get 
                  your contact information and get back 
                  to you as soon as possible. 

    INT. MEETING ROOM - LATER

    Clark walks around as Miles, Latrell, Ross and Megan watch.

                                CLARK
                  This one s very intriguing.

                                ROSS
                  It isn t a one.                                                                                      18.

                  Yes.

                                MILES
                  I don t know this one.

                                CLARK
                  Keeping the chairs at 90 degrees 
                  avoids people directly facing each 
                  other which minimizes confrontation 
                  and makes them more likely to remember 
                  what s said.

    Miles nods, interesting.

                    MetroHealth has sued their own policy 
                  holders to avoid paying for 
                  conventional treatment. You ve got a 
                  better chance of getting a unicorn to 
                  perform an experimental surgery than 
                  of getting them to then to pay for it. 

                                CLARK
                  We re not talking about MetroHealth, 
                  we re talking about one guy, Charles 
                  Murray, and that opens up several very 
                  strong strategies-

                                ROSS
                  It doesn t matter. They re bankrupt. 
                  There s ZERO upside.

                                  LATRELL
                  Maybe the fact that it s impossible is 
                  the upside. Look, we can t nail down 
                  business or investment because no one 
                  seems to believe we can do what we say 
                  we can do. So maybe we pro bono this, 
                  get a head on the wall, and you and I 
                  have something to point to when we re 
                  trying to close people who can pay.

                  I guess I am.                                                                                      19.

                  us. You should really be sitting over 
                  here then. And Megan, why don t you

                  ability to form a cogent argument.

    She blushes and then as everyone starts to shuffle seats-

                  Stop! Just... sit down.

    Ross stops like he s just seen an ax murderer in the office.

                  I told you I needed one more person.

    Claire sticks her head in. Clark crosses to hug her.

                                CLAIRE
                  Sorry I m late. Where should I sit?

    Clark looks at the room. He s intrigued.

    INT. ROSS S OFFICE - DAY

    Ross is fuming. Clark seems oddly composed.

                                CLARK
                  Claire calms me down, Ross. She s like 
                  my magic feather.

                                ROSS
                  Well you may have noticed she has the 
                  exact opposite effect on me! Besides, 
                  I m your magic feather. 

                                CLARK
                    Traditionally, yes. But we re starting 
                  a business together which turns out to 
                  be full of negative triggers like 
                  deadlines and stress and talk about 
                  money, and now you re wrapped up in 
                  those. I haven t slept in four days. 
                  Obviously you don t work anymore.

                                ROSS
                        (hurt)
                  I see.
                        (beat)
                  But she s not the answer. Even if you 
                  were close when we were married- 

                                CLARK
                  When you went to prison I was trying 
                  to deliver a grant proposal and I 
                  hadn t slept for almost two weeks, and 
                  I began to believe I needed to go on a 
                  cross country mission for God. And I 
                  called her. And she came. And the 
                  minute I saw her I started to come 
                  down. If she just sat in the room with 
                  me I could focus. If she laid in the 
                  bed with me I could actually sleep. If-

                                ROSS
                  You slept together?!

                                CLARK
                  We slept in a bed together, yes. After 
                  I d been awake for two weeks!

                                ROSS
                  You don t do that. You don t call my 
                  ex wife to tuck you in. We ALL got 
                  divorced! That s how it works.

                                CLARK
                  Were you available? I didn t know they 
                  let you out for  brother s grant 
                  proposal has turned into interstate 
                  holy mission . If it weren t for her 
                  I d have ended up in Iowa mowing down 
                  satanic corn in a rental car!                                                                                       21.

                  if he s working with you God knows he 
                  needs it.

                                ROSS
                  So when he asks you come running. When

                  Ross, I told you I m not cut out for 
                  the real world. I told you I should be 
                  looking for another teaching job. But 
                  you wanted me to try, and if you want 
                  me to stay, then I need her. By which 
                  I mean, I won t do it without her. 

    Ross stares, sees Clark s dead serious. Claire just smiles.

                                CLARK
                  Why don t you take the rest of the day-

                  Please, just let Claire sit with Miles 
                  and I. We ll figure it out.

    That stings. Clark pats his shoulder, turns, smiles at Claire.

                                CLARK
                  You want to meet the gang? You re 
                  going to love them. Megan, she s an 
                  actress we use, or would use if we 
                  ever did anything, she was in an 
                    infomercial once. Did you ever see the 
                  one for that thing that was like an 
                  oven mitt for the shower?

    OFF Ross, stunned at how quickly he s been sidelined.

    INT. EDWARDS & ASSOCIATES OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

    There s a whiteboard full of ideas and cross outs. A table 
    littered with junk food wrappers and drinks. Clark and Miles 
    look spent. Claire sleeps curled up on the couch.

                                MILES
                  I really feel like a request reversal

                  - four hours! My God. Four hours!

    Clark starts to stress, pace. He recognizes this, walks over 
    the couch, more or less sits on Claire. She wakes with a jolt.                                                                                      23.

    He relaxes some, though his leg continues to bounce rapidly.

                  Exactly.                                                                                      24.

                                CLAIRE
                  Wait. Will someone finish a sentence? 
                  What are we talking about?

                                CLARK
                    Adrenalized implantation. It s- okay, 
                  we ve known for a long time that 
                  incidents that occur when you 
                    significantly raise adrenaline levels 
                  become highly memorable, almost like 
                  they re seared into your brain. Think 
                  of a car crash, or a soldier in a 
                  firefight. And we know from talking to 
                  people who ve been in these highly 
                    adrenalized circumstances, that what 
                  you do, your actions under fire, you 
                  start see those as character defining, 
                  almost like you get a glimpse of your 
                  true self. So the question became, if 
                  we created the circumstances that 
                  elevated your adrenaline levels, if we 
                  guided your reaction and your 
                  thoughts, could we essentially implant 
                  thoughts that you would begin to see 
                  as part of your deepest character?    

                                MILES
                  It s almost like when you raise 
                  someone s adrenaline levels you turn 
                  their brain into wet cement, and you 
                  can write anything you want about them 
                  before it dries and they ll believe 
                  it s a deep personal truth. When I was 
                  Clark s graduate assistant I drew up a 
                  proposal to show how it could be used 
                  to get a candidate to pull out of the 
                  race for student body president.

                                CLARK
                  Which I denied because it would have 
                  been highly unethical.

                                MILES
                  My point is it would have worked.

                                CLARK
                  The question isn t always  can you  do 
                  something, Miles, sometimes it s 
                   should you . I seem to remember you 
                  getting expelled for getting that one 
                  wrong.

                                CLAIRE
                  But you think this would work on our 
                  guy?

                                CLARK
                  IF we could spike his adrenaline 
                  levels and implant the idea that he s 
                  the kind of person we need him to be, 
                  the kind of person who would be 
                  willing to help a family in desperate 
                  need, then yes, the research suggests 
                  that s exactly how he ll behave.

                  Ok. Ok. So we put Megan in a distress

    Off Miles and Clark - 

    INT. RENTAL VAN - MORNING

    Clark, Claire, Miles and Megan, who s dressed simply but looks 
    striking, surround Latrell, who s dressed like a scary 
    vagrant. As Clark hands Latrell a mic and earpiece-

                                  LATRELL
                  You want me to fight him? 

                                MILES
                  Just a little.

                                CLARK
                        (to Miles)
                  No. 
                        (to Latrell)
                  No. I want you to provoke an 
                    adrenalized response.

                                  LATRELL
                  That sounds like a fight.

                                MEGAN
                  I thought you meant fight too.

                                CLARK
                  No fight! Okay! I told you, just be 
                    threatening until he - 

    Suddenly the van door slides open revealing Ross, not happy.

                                ROSS
                  What the hell? Our first job and 
                  you re going to do it without me?                                                                                       26.

                  I sent you a text. There wasn t time 
                  for anything else. We spent all night 
                  working out a plan and barely had a 
                  chance to-

                                ROSS

                  They want me to get in a fight with 
                  Charles Murray.

                  Latrell-

                                ROSS
                  Beat him into giving the kid an 
                  operation? That s your plan? That 
                  doesn t sound like psychological 
                    manipulation, it sounds like you spent 
                  all night watching Goodfellas.

                                CLAIRE
                  There s not going to be a fight. 
                  Latrell s just going to upset the guy 
                  until he wants to fight so Megan can 
                  redefine his character. It s called 
                    adrelanized implantation.

    Clark s impressed. Ross is jealous that he s not in the know.

                                  LATRELL
                  If you re all so excited about it, why 
                  can t one of you do it?

                                MILES
                  Because you re black.

                                  LATRELL
                  Oh, there s no white homeless people?!

                                CLARK
                  He just means the racial differences 
                  between you and Murray will get the 
                  most adrenalized out group response. 
                  But the anger s good. Use that.

                        (looking up the street)
                  I think that s him.

    Heads turn to see CHARLES MURRAY, late 30 s, meek, balding, 
    bad tie, coming down far end of the block.

                                ROSS
                  Him? He s supposed to want to fight 
                  Latrell? That guy s never been in a 
                  fight in his life.                                                                                      27.

                  What about his hands? And why are you 
                  acting like you know everything?

                                CLAIRE
                  Because I was actually there when we 
                  put the plan together. 

                                ROSS
                  He asked me to go home.

                                CLAIRE
                  Exactly. And he asked me to stay.

                                MILES
                  His ring finger is much longer than 
                  his index.

                                ROSS
                  What s that have to do with anything?

                                CLARK
                  There was a road rage study that

                  of who would fly off the handle wasn t 
                  body type or appearance, but 
                    surprisingly, high testosterone 
                  exposure levels suggested by index to 
                  ring finger proportions.

                                MILES
                  This guys  fingers indicate he s not 
                  only provokable, he might actually go 
                  into some kind of blind rage. We re 
                  filming this, right?   

                                  LATRELL
                  This is not what I signed up for.

    Latrell starts to take off the clothes. Megan reaches out.

                                MEGAN
                  You ll be fine. I always get nervous

                  your mouth it will go away.

                                  LATRELL

    EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING

    Charles waits for the bus. Megan sits on the other end of the 
    bench. They smile briefly at one another.

    EXT. STREET - INTERCUT

    Latrell, nervous, makes his way toward the bus stop. He 
    hesitates. He speaks into a mic we can t see.

                  Latrell s not like that. He was only 
                  good because he never knew the 
                    investments we were selling weren t 
                  real.

                  questions. What was I supposed to say?

                                ROSS
                  Nothing!

    ON LATRELL who s made it to the bus stop, but just stands in 
    front of Megan, frozen. She looks at him, eyes pleading. 

                                  LATRELL
                        (weakly)
                  Hey. You re uh... you...

    But he just trails off. As Megan stares up at him-

    ON CLARK-

                                CLARK
                        (into walkie)
                  Come on Latrell. Come on.

    EXT. FAR CORNER - INTERCUT

    Miles sees THE BUS coming down the block.

                                MILES
                        (into walkie)
                  Guys. Bus incoming. Time to go.                                                                                      30.

    CONTINUED:

    LATRELL GLANCES up, sees the bus. Still he can t do it.

    BACK ON CLAIRE AND ROSS who continue fighting, oblivious.

                                CLAIRE
                  You know what the most insulting part 
                  was? Not that they hauled me in for 
                    questioning a hundred times. But that 
                  they just couldn t believe I didn t 
                  know the whole time. That someone 
                  could really lie to their wife about 
                  almost every aspect of their life 
                  together. They didn t think that was 
                  possible. I told them obviously they 
                  hadn t spent enough time with you.

                                ROSS
                  I was trying to protect you. I didn t-

    Suddenly CLARK STARTS to come unglued.

                                CLARK
                  Will you two stop it! We re right in 
                  the middle of a delicate- and Latrell 
                  won t - and the bus is-

    Clark suddenly turns around and starts to KICK the van. Over 
    and over. Hard.

                                CLARK
                        (into walkie)
                  Latrell! DO IT! NOW! What is wrong 
                  with you! Why won t you- NOW! Latrell! 
                  Now! Now! Now! Now!

    Suddenly Claire hugs him, pinning his arms to his side. She 
    puts her lips right next to his ear. It s almost intimate.

                                CLAIRE
                        (whispering)
                  Hey. It s okay. It s okay. Relax.

    Ross watches, surprised, somewhat jealous, that this actually 
    seems to bring Clark down. 

    MEGAN LOOKS UP, sees the bus is almost there. She locks eyes 
    with Latrell. She gives him a tiny smile and confident nod. 
    Latrell absorbs that and then suddenly...

                                  LATRELL
                  HEY!

    Both Megan and Charles jump at the sound of Latrell s voice.

    ON CLARK as he looks up, buoyed by the sound of Latrell 
    through the walkie, actually doing it.

    BACK ON LATRELL-

                                  LATRELL
                  You re on my bench! That s my bench!                                                                                       31.

    CONTINUED: (2)

                                MEGAN
                  I m sorry, I - 

    She starts to get up, but Latrell pushes her back down. That 
    causes Charles to speak up, although meekly.

                                  CHARLES
                  Hey, there s no need to-

    Latrell suddenly wheels on him.

                                  LATRELL
                  What! What did you say!

    Charles freezes, intimidated. Latrell waits, unsure.

    CLARK, CLAIRE, and ROSS are watching.

                                CLARK
                        (calmed, into walkie)
                  Don t let up, Latrell. He ll snap. I 
                  promise. Just keep going.

    AS THE BUS BEARS DOWN, Latrell decides to go for it. He steps 
    closer to Charles.

                                  LATRELL
                  You have a problem?! Huh?!

                                  CHARLES
                  No. I was just saying that-

    Latrell SHOVES Charles. And with that... Charles snaps. He 
    SHOVES Latrell back and comes after him like a rabid dog.

                                  CHARLES
                  DON T TOUCH ME! YOU HEAR ME! I WILL-

    SLOW MOTION for a beat as Charles screams, veins popping, 
    spittle flying. Latrell doing the same as he backs away.

    RESUME as the bus stops-

                                  CHARLES
                  GET OUT OF HERE! GO! NOW!

    Latrell turns, moves down the block. The BUS DRIVER sticks his 
    head out of the bus.

                                BUS DRIVER
                  Everything okay?

    As Charles turns back toward the bus, shaking with adrenaline, 
    Megan looks at him admiringly.

                                MEGAN
                  Yeah. We re fine now.

    As they step toward the bus, she puts a hand on Charles  arm.

                                MEGAN
                  Thank you.                                                                                      32.

    CONTINUED: (3)

    Charles looks at her, nods.

    INT. VAN

    Miles drives, Claire in the passenger seat, Clark, Latrell, 
    and Ross watching intently as they follow the bus. 

                                CLARK
                        (to Ross)
                  See, at the moment he s completely 
                  suggestible. Everything she puts in 
                  his head now will crystallize into the 
                  new way he sees himself once the 
                  adrenaline fades.

    INT. BUS - INTERCUT

    Megan sits next to Charles.

                                MEGAN
                  I just... You don t meet a lot of 
                  people who are willing to stick their 
                  neck out like that. To help someone 
                  they don t even know just because it s 
                  like... the right thing.

                                  CHARLES
                  It really wasn t that big a deal. I 
                  just-

                                MEGAN
                  It was Charles. If you hadn t been 
                  there, if you hadn t been... the kind 
                  of person you are... I m just lucky 
                  you re one of the good ones.

    She smiles warmly. The bus stops as this washes over him - 

    INT. VAN 

    They watch as Megan and Charles get off. She scribbles on a 
    piece of paper and hands it to him.

                                  LATRELL
                  What s she doing?

                                MILES
                  Giving him her number. Or a number 
                  anyway. It ll keep him thinking about 
                  her and by extension the type of 
                  person she believes him to be when he 
                  sits down with Sophie and Tyler.

    They watch as Megan gives Charles a little kiss on the cheek 
    as they part and he heads toward the MetroHealth building.

                                ROSS
                  And all that s really going to make 
                  him say yes?                                                                                      33.


    INT. METROHEALTH INSURANCE - LOBBY - INTERCUT

    Charles gets off the elevator grinning as he looks at Megan s 
    number on a scrap of paper. 

                                CLARK (V.O.)
                  No. But It s going to make him believe 
                  that when someone s really in need, 
                  he s the kind of person who says yes. 

    Sophie and Tyler look up from their chairs, lock eyes with 
    Charles. A beat, then he offers them a smile, motions them 
    toward his office. As they rise-

                                CLARK (V.O.)
                  We can t force him to say one thing or 
                  another. It s not mind control.

    INT. VAN - RESUME

    Clark looks at Ross.

                                CLARK
                  But we can make him believe he s a 
                  different, better person, and we can 
                  hope that leads to a different, better 
                  answer.

    Suddenly the van door opens, revealing Megan.

                                MEGAN
                  How d we do?

    Everyone looks Clark. 

                                CLARK
                  I d say if we get a call in the next 
                  three hours we have a... 40% chance?

                                MILES
                  No offense, but shouldn t you 
                    overestimate. I assume you ve read the 
                  papers arguing that even expressing 
                  false confidence can positively shape 
                  outcomes? 

                                CLARK
                  The lead confederate in a highly 
                  experimental procedure we developed 
                  and deployed in six hours was our 
                  untrained head of business development 
                  dressed a homeless person. I was 
                    overestimating, Miles. By a lot.

    INT. EDWARDS & ASSOCIATES OFFICE

    Sophie, Tyler, Miles, and Latrell sit, waiting. Clark paces. 
    He starts to move an armchair. Ross guides him to sit.

                                CLARK
                  It s been too long. The effect can 
                  fade. If you miss the window-

                                ROSS
                  Stop. You said yourself that it would 
                  take some time, that he d need to 
                  create a narrative to feel like he 
                  came to the decision on his own.

                                CLARK
                  But that wouldn t take-

                                ROSS
                  Clark- you did a good job.

    A beat as Clark takes those words to heart. He nods. From the 
    other part of the room a phone RINGS.

                                MILES
                  It s him.

    Clark and Ross move quickly to Sophie who s now on the phone.

                                SOPHIE
                  Yes. Yes. I understand. Right. Oh. 
                  Okay. Yes. I appreciate it. 

    When she hangs up she has tears in her eyes. Everyone is 
    afraid to ask. She stands, unable to speak, and hugs Clark.

                                SOPHIE
                        (through tears)
                  Thank you.

                                CLARK
                  Yes! Okay! For a second there I was 
                  worried that maybe we failed to 
                  sufficiently raise the level of his-

    Sophie turns away, not listening, and hugs Tyler. 

                                CLARK
                  Oh, right. 

    Clark turns, high fives Ross and other members of the team. 
    When he gets to Claire, they hug. Ross stares, troubled.

    INT. BAR - NIGHT

    Clark is on a small karaoke stage passionately belting out  I 
    Want To Know What Love Is . Megan and Claire are at one end of 
    a long table while Ross, Miles, and Latrell are deep in 
    excited, drunken conversation at the other.                                                                                      35.

                  I m talking about the people with deep 
                  pockets. Politicians trying to get

                                MILES
                    Politicians trying to avoid jail.

                    Billionaire trying to take over a 
                  company. 

                                MILES
                  Or effect the stock price. There s 
                  almost nothing you can t manipulate. 
                  You could start a war if you wanted.

                                  LATRELL
                  Why the hell would you want to start a 
                  war?

                                MILES
                  Stop a war then. You could do either.

                                ROSS
                  The point is, once the word gets out 
                  about what we can do, there s going to 
                  be millions just there for the taking. 

                                  LATRELL
                  Hey, let s not forget we just gave 
                  that kid a whole new life. That s 
                  pretty great. And there s a lot more 
                  people like that, regular, innocent 
                  people getting screwed who could use 
                  our help. Instead of just chasing the 
                  highest bidder wouldn t it be cool to 
                  actually fix some things? 

    Ross and Miles look at each other.

                      ROSSMILES
    Work for free? Not really.I was more drawn to the 
                                                  millions part.

    ON MEGAN AND CLAIRE as Claire notes Megan staring at Ross.

                                CLAIRE
                  How d they find you?

                                MEGAN
                  Answered an ad. Although, when I sat 
                  down with Ross the whole thing sounded 
                  kinda sketchy. I actually turned him 
                  down.

                                CLAIRE
                  So what are you doing here?                                                                                      36.

                  He called me after. Said he was 
                  willing to bet that when most people 
                  looked at me they just saw a very 
                  pretty face, that I was the kind of 
                  person who probably got sent on a lot 
                  of auditions for parts where the 
                    character s name was just  HOT GIRL . 
                  Which is totally true. He said he

                  that. And that if I took this job, 
                  he d make sure I got to. 

                                CLAIRE
                          (watching Megan s stare at 
                          Ross)
                  Can I give you some advice? You don t 
                  want to do that.

                                MEGAN
                  What?

                                CLAIRE
                    I recognize the look. I m not saying 
                  he s not attractive. I m just saying 
                  it would end badly.

                                MEGAN
                  How long ago did you guys-

                                CLAIRE
                  Three years.

                                MEGAN
                  What happened?

                                CLAIRE
                  It s hard to boil years of lies down 
                  to a single sentence. Just trust me. 
                  It would feel great, and then it would 
                  hurt. Bad.

                                MEGAN
                  And so, now you and Clark...?

                                CLAIRE
                  What? 

                                MEGAN
                    I recognize the look too. I m not 
                  judging. My brother married his ex s 
                  roommate. I mean, it s not the same-

                                CLAIRE
                  No. No, no, no. We re just close 
                  friends. That s all. 

    As they both watch Clark finishing his song-

                                MEGAN
                  Okay.
                        (beat)
                  How many times has he sung this song?                                                                                      37.

                                CLAIRE
                  I think this is number four. His 
                  doctor said it was a good outlet.
                        (beat)
                  I had a look?

                                MEGAN
                  I thought I saw a look.

                                CLAIRE
                  Just friends.

                                MEGAN
                  Okay.

    ON CLARK as he finishes with a flourish, then jumps down, 
    moves to the table and dives in as if he never left.

                                CLARK
                  Also, I just remembered this Danish 
                  fisherman study which was interesting 
                  because it was scalable, so like if we 
                  ever got a job where you were 
                  targeting a whole population you-

    Clark suddenly stops as he notes the COUPLE now on stage, 
    singing. They LAUGH, hold hands, smile at each other.

                                CLARK
                  - they... uh... they told them...

                                MILES
                  Is this the one where they convinced 
                  the fisherman to tax themselves with 
                  mass subliminal suggestion?

                                CLARK
                  It uh... what?

                                CLAIRE
                  Clark? Are you okay?

                                CLARK
                        (still watching the couple)
                  I.. yeah. Fine. 
                        (suddenly)
                  Anyway, great night. Good job. I m 
                  super tired. I m gonna go. I ll see 
                  you guys tomorrow.

    He barely takes a step when - 

                                ROSS
                  Whoa! What s the hurry all of a 
                  sudden? 

                                CLARK
                  Nothing. No hurry. I just need to go.

                                CLAIRE
                  I ll take you. I m about ready myself.                                                                                      38.

    CONTINUED: (4)

                                ROSS
                  I ll take him. He can survive without 
                  you constantly holding his hand.

                                CLAIRE
                  Really? Because when he called that s 
                  pretty much exactly-

                                CLARK
                  Guys! I want to walk. I need to walk. 
                  I m walking. I ll see you tomorrow.

                      CLAIREROSS
    Clark.Clark.

    But he s already rushing for the door. Claire looks at Ross, 
    throws down a twenty, shakes her head is disgust.

                                ROSS
                  You re blaming me? You re the one who-

    Claire just heads for the door.

    EXT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER

    Claire steps out.

                                CLAIRE
                  Clark?

    She looks up and down the street. Clark s gone.

    EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT

    Clark jogs across campus until he comes to some two story 
      apartments. He rushes to a bottom door and begins KNOCKING.

                                CLARK
                  Beth! Beth it s me. Beth we just need 
                  to talk. Come on. Please!

    More KNOCKING as he dials his phone. He gets voicemail.

                                CLARK
                  Beth, come on! Please. I love you 
                  Beth! Can I say that to your face? Can 
                  I say it to your face and if you don t 
                  feel anything, if you don t love me, 
                  if it doesn t make any difference then-

    A GIRL steps out of an apartment above.

                                GIRL
                  Professor Edwards?

    He looks up.

                                CLARK
                  Oh. Hi. Yes. I m sorry. I didn t mean 
                  to be a disturbance. I m just trying-                                                                                      39.

    CONTINUED:

                                GIRL
                  She moved out. Like, two weeks ago.

    Clark is stunned.

                                CLARK
                  No.

                                GIRL
                  Yeah. 

                                CLARK
                  Where?

                                GIRL
                  I don t know. I just saw movers and-

                                CLARK
                  NO!

    The girl recoils. He rushes back to the door, BEATING on it.

                                CLARK
                  No, no, no, no, no, no, no! BETH!

    He steps away from the door, looks around, spots a large rock. 
    He picks it up, HEAVES it through a window. The Girl rushes 
    back into her apartment. Clark reaches through the broken 
    glass, unlocks Beth s door.

    INT. BETH S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

    Clark steps inside. It s completely empty. He stares in 
    disbelief. He stalks around, manic, even as tears begin to 
    flow. He spots a wad of paper, picks it up. It s just doodles, 
    markouts. Trash. But he stares at it, begins to openly CRY.

    He lays down, clutching the paper. And off his tears - 

    INT. ROSS S APARTMENT - MORNING

    Sunlight. Rumpled sheets. Ross next to a RANDOM GIRL. His cell 
    RINGS. 

                                ROSS
                        (groggy, into phone)
                  What?
                          (suddenly alert)
                  I ll be right there.

    He dives out of bed, grabs keys and bolts. Hold on RANDOM GIRL 
    as she rolls over, discovers he s gone. As she looks around - 

                                RANDOM GIRL
                  Royce?

    INT. CAMPUS POLICE STATION - MORNING

    Clark sits silently off to the side as Ross talks with an 
    OFFICER and the UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT.                                                                                      40.

    CONTINUED:

                                  UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
                  Part of our agreement was that he was 
                  not allowed back on campus. Now I 
                  don t want to press charges but-

                                ROSS
                    I understand. I do. The thing is he 
                  was off the medication and- but- we 
                  actually just brought in someone to 
                  help him. A specialist. So, if there s 
                  any way you could-

    ON CLARK who watches them talking but can t hear. As they all 
    look his direction - 

    INT. ROSS S CAR

    Ross and Clark drive in SILENCE.

                                ROSS
                  Should I take you-

                                CLARK
                  No.

                  You could come to my-

                  No.

                                ROSS
                  Clark. You need to rest. If you hadn t 
                  been awake for the last-

                                CLARK
                  Ross... not now.

    INT. EDWARDS & ASSOCIATES OFFICE

    Clark and Ross step off the elevators to find Latrell and 
    Miles worked up.

                                  LATRELL
                  What the hell? Why aren t you 
                  answering your phone?

                                ROSS
                  Been a little busy.

                                  LATRELL
                  We have a problem.

                                ROSS
                  I have one of those also.

                                MILES
                  Murray ok d the surgery but it got 
                  kicked upstairs and-

                                ROSS
                  Miles, not now!                                                                                      41.

                                  LATRELL
                  It s been denied, Ross! 

    This stops Clark and Ross in their tracks. Before they can ask-

                                  LATRELL
                  Murray agreed, but they immediately 
                  convened a  review panel  to give 
                  themselves another out. And they re-

                                MILES
                  It s a sham. Seven people, no medical 
                  training, obvious biases, and we d 
                  need a unanimous recommendation to go 
                  forward. We could go after them, but 
                  you re talking about planning and

                  We re literally looking at eviction, 
                  Ross. We don t have time or resources 
                  to chase this and without it we ve got 
                  nothing to-

    CRASH! Everyone looks up to see that Clark has upended a 
    table. Off their looks-

                                CLARK
                  Oh, I m sorry. You re right. It would 
                  really work better over there.

    CRASH. He hurls the table to the other side of the room.

                                ROSS
                  Clark! Stop!

                                CLARK
                  Why, Ross! It doesn t matter. None of 
                  it matters. They re going to take it 
                  all anyway.

                                ROSS
                  Relax. We just need to put our heads 
                  together and-

                                CLARK
                  I don t want to put our heads 
                  together! Okay! I don t want to do 
                  this. I don t want to be your little 
                  golden goose or whatever. I told you 
                  this wouldn t work. I told you I 
                  didn t belong here. 

                                ROSS
                  You were doing fine. This is a 
                  setback. It s not-

                                CLARK
                  I m not doing fine, Ross! I need to 
                  get away from here. Everything here 
                  makes me think of her. I -                                                                                      42.

                  I just know! And you need to face that 
                  and move on. 

    As Clark heads for the elevators-

                                CLARK
                  Great! Fine. I ll move on. To Alaska,

                  Remember when dad died? You were much 
                  worse than this and I put you back 
                  together. Me. Why are you shutting me

                                CLARK
                  Because I m telling you I want to get 
                  away from here and you re not 
                  listening. Because you don t care 
                  about me, you just can t stand the 
                  idea of your latest get rich quick 
                  scheme walking out the door before you-

                                ROSS
                  This is not about money!

                                CLARK
                  Good! Then it shouldn t matter that I 
                  QUIT! But you don t seem to grasp that 
                  there isn t even anything left TO 
                  QUIT. Let me know when you re ready 
                  face that and move on. 

    Clark takes the stairs and SLAMS the door behind him. The 
    others stand in silence until Ross suddenly HURLS a chair.

    Latrell just stares at Ross, disappointed.

                                  LATRELL
                  Feel better?
                        (beat)
                  Then knock it off. Last thing I need 
                  is to be fighting over security 
                  deposits when all this goes back. 

    Latrell walks into an office. Off Ross - 


                                      END OF ACT III                                                                                      43.


                                            ACT IV

    INT. ROSS S OFFICE - NIGHT

    The office is mostly dark, still a mess. Ross is behind his 
    desk. Miles walks past with a cardboard box full of stuff.

                                ROSS
                  Miles?

    A long beat. Miles reappears in the doorway. They stare.

                                ROSS
                  Are you seriously walking out of here 
                  with a cardboard box?

                                MILES
                  I guess I thought we were pretty much 
                  done. I mean, we re out of ideas and 
                  time, right?

                                ROSS
                  That depends. How do you feel about 
                  moral ambiguity?

    Miles steps in, puts down his box, intrigued.

                                MILES
                  I m pretty comfortable with it, 
                  actually.

                                ROSS
                  We hold a press conference.

                                MILES
                        (shakes his head)
                  There s a million stories about 
                  insurance companies screwing people. 
                  Raking them over the coals is only 
                  likely to solidify their position.

                                ROSS
                  What if I didn t want to rake them 
                  over the coals? What if I wanted to 
                  thank them?

                                MILES
                  Thank them for what?

                                ROSS
                  Approving the surgery.

                                MILES
                  But they denied it.

                                ROSS
                  No one at the press conference will 
                  know that.

    Miles begins to see it.                                                                                      44.

    CONTINUED:

                                MILES
                  You put the kid up there,  thanks for 
                  saving my life , generate a ton of 
                  positive press, make it a feel good 
                  story and basically dare them to ruin 
                  it by backing out.

                                ROSS
                  Pretty much.

                                MILES
                  I guess I could pull together some 
                  data, try to make a real case when 
                  they come in with their hair on fire. 
                  Still, it s insanely risky. I mean the 
                  kid s no actor. You want it to seem 
                  real it would mean convincing him and 
                  his mom we d actually gotten 
                    MetroHealth back on board, and if it 
                  went wrong and we yanked it away AGAIN-

                                ROSS
                  They d be right where they are now.

                                MILES
                  But we d be in very iffy legal 
                  territory. Probably beyond iffy. 
                    MetroHealth calls our bluff, we d be 
                  toast.

                                ROSS
                  You re walking out the door with a 
                  cardboard box. I think we re already 
                  staring down the barrel of being 
                  toast.

                                MILES
                  Do you think Megan would be willing to-

                                ROSS
                  I ll get her on board.

    Off Miles, a little hurt that Ross has that ability.

    INT. MEGAN S APARTMENT - MORNING

    Megan cups a mug of coffee, still in her PJ s as she listens 
      skeptically to Ross, who s noticeably cleaned up.

                                ROSS
                  And since Sophie never met you, she 
                  won t know you re with us.

                                MEGAN
                  It doesn t sound... legal.

                                ROSS
                  It s a gray area. But it s important. 
                  Not just for us. This kid, this 
                  changes his life.                                                                                      45.

    CONTINUED:

                                MEGAN
                  Suddenly you re concerned about the 
                  kid?

                                ROSS
                  I m concerned you ll say no to me, so 
                  I m asking you for the kid.

                                MEGAN
                  No you re not. You know I ll say yes 
                  to you and you re only bringing up the 
                  kid so we can both pretend that s not 
                  how you got me to do it.

                                ROSS
                  Megan, I wasn t trying to-

                                MEGAN
                  Then why come over here looking all... 
                  Why not just call? Or have someone 
                  else call?

    Ross doesn t have a quick answer. 

                                MEGAN
                  Tell you what. I m going to change and 
                  I m going to help. For the kid. But 
                  for the record, I d have done it for 
                  you. In the future I d be really 
                  careful how you play that card.

    OFF Ross as she walks out of the room-

    INT. EDWARDS & ASSOCIATES OFFICE - DAY

    Miles ushers out a group 15 ADULTS OF VARIOUS ETHNICITIES.

                                MILES
                  Thank you all very much.

    Claire gets off one of the elevators, confused by the crowd.

                                CLAIRE
                  Miles?

                                MILES
                  Oh. Hey.

                                CLAIRE
                  What s-

    Another elevator opens revealing a REPORTER and CAMERA CREW. 

                                MILES
                        (to camera crew)
                  That way. Big conference room.

    As the crew goes around a corner Ross comes out of his office 
    with Megan, now in sharp business attire. Miles turns to them.                                                                                      46.

                                ROSS
                        (to Miles)
                  We on schedule?

                                MILES
                  Yeah. Three local affiliates, someone 
                  from AP. If the pictures are 
                  compelling it could get kicked up to 
                  national.

                                CLAIRE
                  What the hell is going on? 

                                MEGAN
                  I don t like Heather. It doesn t sound 
                    professional. I want to go with Dana. 
                  Dana Williams. Is it too late?

                                MILES
                  Nope. Dana Williams. Got it.

    Megan smiles, steps back as if practicing lines. Now Claire s 
    alarm bells are screaming.

                                CLAIRE
                  Where s Clark?

                                ROSS
                  At home. I thought you guys would be 
                  spooning and massaging by now.

                                CLAIRE
                  Ross-

    Suddenly, Sophie and Tyler step off an elevator looking 
    nervous and confused. Ross rushes over. Warmly-

                                ROSS
                  Hey guys. How are we?

                                SOPHIE
                  I... think my head is still spinning a 
                  little bit. I can t believe you got 
                  them to change their minds. Again. How 
                  did you-

                                ROSS
                  It doesn t matter. What matters is 
                  that it s going to happen. Right?
                        (to Tyler)
                  How about you? You ready?

                                TYLER
                  I m a little nervous.

                                ROSS
                  Just speak from the heart, you ll be 
                  fine.

    Megan steps over.

                                MEGAN
                  Hi. I m Dana Williams with MetroHealth-                                                                                      47.

    As soon as she says it, Claire starts to drag Ross away.

                                CLAIRE
                  Excuse us.

    She pulls him around a corner.

                                CLAIRE
                  What in the hell are you-

                                ROSS
                  We needed a new approach.

                                CLAIRE
                  Lying? Fraud?

                                ROSS
                  It s not- listen, Miles has pulled 
                  together a ton of real... data.

    Miles steps over.

                                MILES
                  I think we re ready.

                                CLAIRE
                  Ross.

                                ROSS
                        (to Miles)
                  Give me a sec.

    Miles moves off. Ross turns to Claire.

                                ROSS
                  Look, I know you don t think much of 
                  me-
                        (off her HUFF)
                  And you re probably right. But 
                  whatever happened between us, whatever 
                  was said, whatever I did, you know 
                  more than anyone that I love Clark. 
                  How many times did I talk about 
                  starting a business with him? How many 
                  times did I beg him to pick me over 
                  some research grant or associate 
                    professorship in the middle of god 
                  knows where?

                                CLAIRE
                  Because you thought you could make a 
                  fortune manipulating people.

                                ROSS
                  No. I know I can make a fortune 
                  manipulating people. I ve been to 
                  prison for it. I wanted it because I 
                  think we re good for each other. 
                  Remember when he was staying with us 
                  for six months after the med school 
                  let him go? He was in good place then.                                                                                      48.

                                CLAIRE
                  Yeah, because I sat with him and 
                  talked to him every day while you-

                                ROSS
                  Fine. Maybe you re the Clark 
                  whisperer. Maybe it was always you. 
                  But I was in a good place then too. 
                  Remember that? I had my act together. 
                  Stayed out of trouble. Even you and 
                  me... we were happy. So, fine, maybe 
                  he doesn t need me. Maybe I need him. 
                  Is that the worst thing in the world? 
                  To feel like you re a better person 
                  when your brother s around? 

                                CLAIRE
                  Why are you telling me this? 

                                ROSS
                  Because he s made it clear over and 
                  over, he s not interested in staying 
                  for me. But maybe he will for you. And 
                  if I can keep this thing alive-

                                MILES
                  Ross-

                                ROSS
                  Okay. Yeah. I m coming.

                                CLAIRE
                  Ross, please, whatever you re planning-

                                ROSS
                  Trust me. It ll be fine.

                                CLAIRE
                  Can you think of a single time you 
                  said that to me and weren t wrong?

    Ross SNORTS a laugh, smiles, walks to the others. Off Claire-

    INT. CONFERENCE SPACE - DAY

    There s a small dais up front, a few of REPORTERS and CAMERAS 
    aimed at Sophie, Megan, and Tyler, who speaks nervously.

                                TYLER
                  So, I really just wanted to say thank 
                  you.

    Ross and Miles watch from the side. Ross leans over.

                                ROSS
                  We should have told him to cry. 

                                MILES
                  Asking someone to express a particular 
                  emotion actually makes it harder for 
                  them to do so.                                                                                      49.

    CONTINUED:

                                ROSS
                  Really? Does that work for anger too?

    ON TYLER at the mic.

                                TYLER
                  ... and now I m going to get a chance 
                  to see what it s like to be well. The 
                  doctors said I might even get to do 
                  some of the things I always wanted to. 
                  Like play soccer.
                        (beat, then tearing up)
                  And now my mom won t have to take care 
                  of me all the time. And maybe she ll 
                  get to do some of the things she 
                  always wanted to too.

    At that Sophie breaks and moves to hug Tyler. They both CRY.

                                MILES
                  Jackpot.

    But when he looks over, Ross is tearing up himself.

    ON MEGAN stepping to the mic.

                                MEGAN
                  We at MetroHealth certainly thank 
                  Tyler for those kind words, but our 
                  hope is to create a world where an 
                  insurance company doing what s right 
                  isn t considered an exception. We ve 
                  been accused of caring more about the 
                  bottom line than people, and sadly 
                  there have been times where the 
                  charges have seemed warranted. But 
                    MetroHealth is changing that, and-.

    ON ROSS dialing his phone as Megan continues. Miles leans over 
    to him.

                                MILES
                  Is it just me, or is this suddenly 
                  feeling more like something we could 
                  go to jail over?

                                ROSS
                  I wouldn t say MORE. The odds of it 
                  blowing up in our faces have always 
                  seemed relatively high to me. 
                        (into phone)
                  Yeah. Ross Edwards, Edwards and 
                    Associates. No he doesn t, but I 
                  assure you he s going to want to speak 
                  with me before the afternoon news hits 
                  the air.

    INT. CLARK S APARTMENT

    Clark is wildly throwing things into a suitcase when he looks 
    up, sees Claire standing in his room.

                                CLARK
                  What are you- how did you get in here?

                                CLAIRE
                  The door was open. Like, you literally 
                  left the door hanging open.

                                CLARK
                  There was a study that showed an open 
                  door makes a home a less of a target-

                                CLAIRE
                  You re leaving?

                                CLARK
                  I don t belong in this kind of 
                  environment. 

                                CLAIRE
                  Then why did you do it in the first 
                  place?

                                CLARK
                  I guess Ross got me excited about the 
                  puzzle of it. Putting the research 
                  into the real world. Pull the strings. 
                  But I m not built for the real world. 
                  I think that s obvious now. Academics-

                                CLAIRE
                  You ve been fired, censured, on 
                  probation, or quit every teaching job 
                  you ve ever had. Why do you keep 
                  saying that s where you belong?

                                CLARK
                  They tolerate me. Write papers, 
                  lecture, issue some apologies, repeat. 
                  I get that. I know how to do that. 

                                CLAIRE
                  Tolerating you is not the same as 
                  appreciating you, Clark. It s not the 
                  same as caring about you. 

                                CLARK
                  Ross doesn t really care about-

                                CLAIRE
                  He does. Believe me, he s a long way 
                  from perfect, but he absolutely cares. 
                  He cares so much I think he s about to 
                  do something colossally stupid to try 
                  to  fix  everything and keep you here. 
                  And here s the thing. I think maybe 
                  it s a good idea. 
                                (MORE)                                                                                      51.

                  Not whatever he s doing, but you 
                  staying. I think maybe this is exactly 
                  where you belong. A place where people 
                  don t just tolerate you, they need 
                  you. I know when you called, when you 
                  said you needed me... that felt good. 
                  I m not great at a lot of things, but 
                  you made me feel like I was great 
                  at... whatever it is I do for you, and 
                  that was exciting. I guess if I was 
                  really any good you wouldn t packing.

                                CLARK
                  It s not you. I... I don t know what 
                  happens, okay? Things go well for a 
                  while, and I feel like I m building 
                  something and then it s like suddenly 
                  everything catches on fire and I just 
                  end up watching it burn. 

                                CLAIRE
                  Then just tell me this- do you want to 
                  leave? Or are you afraid to stay? 
                  Because if it s the first one, I don t 
                  think I can do anything. But if it s 
                  the second one... I think maybe I 
                  could help you. I could be like, your 
                  fire department. And for once, instead 
                  of seeing everything disappear, you 
                  could see what it s like to save it.

    OFF Clark, considering-

    INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

    Ross, Miles, and Megan sit across from TOM DANIELS, 60 s, and 
    two other ANGRY METROHEALTH OFFICIALS as a monitor shows a 
    clip where Tyler tearfully hugs his mother. Ross hits pause.

                                ROSS
                  Something similar s been picked up by 
                  the cable news channels and nightly 
                  network broadcasts.

    Miles brings up charts and graphs on another monitor.

                                MILES
                  Not only is the clip in the news 
                  cycle, we re seeing power law 
                  resharing on social networks that- 

                                MEGAN
                  He s saying you re going viral.

                                MILES
                  Exactly. Viral. Given the cross 
                  platform exposure we d conservatively 
                  put the promotional value of the clip 
                  at seven million dollars.

                  Further, initial focus group testing 
                  shows that not only does the story 
                  skyrocket MetroHealth s positive name 
                  recognition, but that the new business 
                  revenue potential dwarfs the 
                    promotional value and renders the 
                  actual cost of the procedure itself 
                  completely insignificant.

    All eyes go to Tom. A long beat, then he stands.

                                TOM DANIELS
                  You are, as a group, beyond 
                    delusional.

                  Mr. Daniels-

                                TOM DANIELS
                  Was your hope that a few charts would 
                  make it seem less overtly criminal?

                                ROSS
                  Our hope was that you d look at what 
                  was on them and recognize a fantastic 
                    opportunity for your company.

                                TOM DANIELS
                  The only opportunity we re remotely 
                  interested in is the opportunity to 
                  see you dismantled and prosecuted.

                  Probably wanted to keep you clean in

    INT. EDWARDS & ASSOCIATES OFFICE

    As Clark, Claire, and Latrell step in, the group is coming out 
    of the conference room.

                                ROSS
                  Mr. Daniels, hold on a minute. There s

                  See, I don t think anyone really

    Clark takes Latrell s briefcase, hands it to Claire.

                                CLARK
                  Sit there, look impatient. Latrell, 
                  when I put my hands in my pockets, 
                  step over and say Dr. Barnes is very 
                  busy.

                  Just do it. Please. Now.

    As Claire and Latrell look at each other, uncertain, and take 
    seats, Clark takes a breath and walks right to Tom Daniels.

    Clark looks at Ross, who s shocked to see him.

                                CLARK
                  Is this the idiot from MetroHealth?

                  publicity, but he kept saying win-win. 
                  Win-win. That s the difference between 
                  us. I m more win-lose. Win-destroy.

                                CLARK
                  Of course. That would imply you had 
                  some clue what you were doing. That s 
                  Dr. Claire Barnes, special liaison to 
                  the senate subcommittee on health 
                  insurance regulation and reform? You 
                  know, the people with the fate of your 
                  whole industry in their hands? See 
                  they don t think you guys should get 
                  to decide for yourselves what is and 
                  what isn t experimental. They want a 
                  panel of doctors and bureaucrats to do 
                  it for you, and they re dying for a 
                  case just like this to hammer you 
                  with. And boy are we going to hammer. 
                  Little teary Tyler and his curable 
                  heart condition are going to be 
                  sitting in front of congress and 
                  you re going to be twisting in your 
                  chair covered in so much flop sweat 
                  Mark McGuire is going to call to say 
                  you came off poorly. And when you end 
                  up with some committee telling you how 
                  and when to pay up, you re going to be 
                  sobbing at the memory that someone 
                  once offered you a gift wrapped, win-
                  win, get out of jail free card, and 
                  you were too stupid to take it.

    As Clark slips his hands into his pockets Latrell comes over.

                                  LATRELL
                  I m sorry, but Dr. Barnes really is 
                  very busy.

                                CLARK
                  Of course. Let s go into my office.

    Clark turns to leave with Latrell. A beat and then-

                                TOM DANIELS
                  Wait.

    Clark halts, looks back. Off Ross, cracking a smile-

    INT. EDWARDS & ASSOCIATES OFFICE - LATER

    As Ross soberly walks Tom and his associates to the elevator-

                                TOM DANIELS
                  We ll take the publicity, we ll take 
                  the business, but eventually this is 
                  going to catch up with you. I m going 
                  to make sure of it.                                                                                      55.

    Ross pulls a card from his pocket, hands it to Tom.

                                ROSS
                  Meanwhile, you ever find yourself in a 
                  tough spot, you know who to call.

    Tom steps on and the elevators close. Ross turns, a huge smile 
    on his face, and hugs Clark.

                                ROSS
                  That was brilliant!

                                MILES
                  I m curious how you chose your 
                  posture. I assume you know about the 
                    threat-aggressor studies from-

    Suddenly they re staring at stone faced Claire and Latrell.

                                ROSS
                  What? Were you guys not here? We just 
                  won.

                                CLAIRE
                  No, you just lied and cheated to get 
                  what you wanted. Like you ve always 
                  done. Except this time you dragged all 
                  of us into it.

                                ROSS
                  Hey, I didn t ask you to be here. We-

                                CLAIRE
                  You d be talking to the police if 
                  Clark hadn t saved you.

                                ROSS
                  I admit it went a little sideways, but-

                                CLAIRE
                  If we re going to do this, there have 
                  to be rules. You can t just turn your 
                  new business into your old one.

                                ROSS
                  What is this? You don t issue demands! 
                  I don t work for you! 

                                  LATRELL
                  I m with her. If it s just going to be 
                  another boiler room, I m out.

    Ross starts to respond when-

                                CLARK
                  Next time we find another way. 

    Now Ross is listening. He looks at Clark. Then, calmly-                                                                                      56.

                  You may have noticed that the person 
                    responsible for finding other ways 
                  wasn t here.

                                CLARK
                  I know. But I will be. 

                                ROSS
                  Really?

                                CLARK
                  Can you color in the lines?

                                ROSS
                        (beat)
                  Sure. Okay.

                                CLARK
                  Then yeah, really.

    Ross smiles, grabs his bag, starts to head out.

                                CLARK
                  Where are you going?

                                ROSS
                  To see if I can get someone to give us 
                  some actual money so you guys can get 
                  paid to stand around yelling at me. 

                                CLARK
                  You want me to come with you?

                      ROSSLATRELL
    That s okay.No!

    As Ross nears the elevator he stops short.

                                ROSS
                  You know, I did manage to get that kid 
                  his surgery. Does that matter at all?

                                CLARK
                  The question isn t whether what you 
                  did matters to us. It s whether how 
                  you did it will ever matter to you?

    Off that landing on Ross - 

    INT. HIGH RISE - OFFICE

    Ross sits on a couch, 90 degrees from Ted Sanders, the

                                ROSS
                  Ten. Fifteen would have exceeded the 
                  maximum daily withdrawal on my ATM.

    Ross seems focused on a photo on the wall. He nods toward it.

                                ROSS

    Suddenly Ross can t do it. Maybe  how  does matter to him.

                                ROSS
                  Actually, I ve never actually been 
                  there. My ten minutes started five 
                  minutes ago when she let me in here 
                  and I looked at your pictures. There s

                  Pulled it up on my phone which is the 
                  only place I ve ever seen Almont and 
                  I m pretty sure I couldn t catch a 
                  fish in a bowl. Can I be honest?

                                TED
                  The odds do seem against it.

                                ROSS
                  I m a little mixed up at the moment 
                  about what s good strategy and what s 
                  mirroring and priming and Jedi mind 
                  tricks and what s just lying. What I 
                  do know is in the last two days we 
                  convinced an insurance company to say 
                  yes to something they said no to for 
                  over two years. And because of that 
                  this kid, this boy- what we did is 
                  going to change his life. It s a good 
                  story. I ll send you the news clips. 
                  And if you re looking for a track 
                  record, they ll have to do. But I m 
                  telling you- if we can do something 
                  impossible once, we can do it again. 
                  And once people see that, we won t 
                  have to go looking for them, they ll 
                  be chasing us. We re not asking you to 
                  break the bank, we re asking you to 
                  help keep the lights on. And for that, 
                  you get to be part of something 
                  special. Something new. You said you 
                  believed in the science, but not us. 
                  And maybe with me that s fair, but not 
                  with Clark. With Clark it s completely 
                  backwards. The science is just 
                  science. Disconnected papers, 
                  experiments, observations. Clark s the 
                  genius who sees how to bring it to 
                  life. And the people who do things for 
                  the first time, the true pioneers, 
                  they usually aren t like the rest of 
                  us. But that s not a reason you run 
                  from them. It s why you bet on them.  

    OFF Ted, considering - 

    INT. EDWARDS & ASSOCIATES OFFICE - EVENING

    Ross steps in, finds everything dark but Clark s office. He 
    looks in, sees Clark resting beside Claire. He lets them be.

    As he turns for his own office he sees BETH, an attractive, 23 
    year old in the lobby. A smile of recognition crosses her 
    face. As Ross rushes over, the smile is not returned.

    EXT. PARKING GARAGE - EVENING

    Ross is reading Beth the riot act.

                                ROSS
                  You cannot be here, Beth. This was NOT 
                  the agreement. I paid you a small 
                  fortune to walk away never to be-

                  That s all of it. I don t want it.
                        (off Ross s stunned silence)
                  I know it was just supposed to be an 
                  act, but something happened. I 
                  really... I like him. I tried to go 
                  away like we said, but... I want to 
                  see if maybe we could make it work.

                                ROSS
                  It did work. You got him fired! That s 
                  all I asked for. That was the 
                  agreement! You can t come back now!

                                BETH
                  I m sorry. But I can t let him go. And 
                  he obviously can t let me go either.
                  Look, I m not going to tell him about 
                  our deal. I swear. It would be as bad 
                  for me as it would you.

                                ROSS
                  Oh really? Are you his brother?

    INT. CLARK S OFFICE

    Clark and Claire are now sitting on the couch flipping through 
      a magazine. They re smiling, enjoying each other.

                                CLARK
                  To sell anything. It s called 
                  experiential transference. You confuse-

    Clark suddenly stops. Claire follows his eyes to find Beth 
    standing in the doorway, Ross just behind her. Clark slowly 
    stands, unsure. A beat, and then he rushes to her. They kiss.

    ON CLAIRE who seems troubled, maybe slightly jealous. When 
    Clark and Beth break, Clark turns to Claire and Ross. He s 
      practically coming out of his skin with excitement.                                                                                      60.

                  Sorry. Claire, Ross, this is Beth. 
                  Like, Beth, the, you know, Beth.

                                CLAIRE
                  Hello.

                                ROSS
                  We ve met. In the lobby.

                                CLARK
                        (to Beth)
                  What are you... I mean, I left all 
                  those messages and went to your place-

                                BETH
                  I know. I messed up.

                                CLARK
                        (beat, smiling)
                  Have you eaten?

    She shakes her head. Clark grabs his coat.

                                CLARK
                        (to Ross and Claire)
                  I m... I ll see you guys tomorrow.

    Ross watches as Clark and Beth walk toward the lobby, smiling, 
    talking. Claire joins him in the doorway, watches them go.

                                CLAIRE
                  Why do I have a very bad feeling about 
                  those two?

                                ROSS
                  I have no idea.

    Claire grabs her purse, starts to leave. After a few feet she 
    stops. Almost as an afterthought-

                                CLAIRE
                  How d it go? With your investor?

                                ROSS
                  We got the money.

                                CLAIRE
                    Congratulations.
                        (beat)
                  Look at it this way- least we got all 
                  the ugly stuff out of the way early.

    Nervously watching Clark and Beth kiss by the elevators-

                                ROSS
                  Right. Smooth sailing from here on.
