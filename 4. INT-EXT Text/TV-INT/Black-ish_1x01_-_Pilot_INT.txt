      FOUND& YOU RE WELCOME.   A HAND stops the ALARM.  CAMERA PANS and 
      RESTS on the wide faced smile of ANDRE  DRE  JOHNSON, 35, Black 
      (not African-American, he hates that shit), still laying in bed. 

                                DRE (V.O.)
                Okay, so, I m just your standard, 
                regular ol , massively well endowed, 
                Black dude.  

      CAMERA PANS to Dre s sleeping wife, RAINBOW, 35, mouth agape, 
      drooling, hair disheveled, one eye partially opened.

                                DRE (V.O.)
                This drooling, jaundice complexioned, 
                mixed race woman is my wife, Rainbow.   
                And despite what she looks like right 
                now, she s a doctor.  


      Dre s now out of bed and brushing his teeth.

                                DRE (V.O.)
                We re lucky.  We ve got great jobs...

      Dre stands in front of a ridiculously large collection of 
      HIGH-END SNEAKERS, deciding on a shoe for the day.

                                DRE (V.O.)
                I guess for a kid from the hood, I m 
                living the American Dream.  Only 
                problem is; Whatever  American  it was 
                who had the  Dream , probably wasn t 
                Black.  And if he was, he should have 
                  mentioned the part about how when 
                Brotha s start getting a little money, 
                stuff starts getting a little weird.   


      Dre, drinking coffee, notices the newspaper s headline: 
       MILEY CYRUS   TWERKIN' 9 TO 5!!   He groans, disgusted.

                                DRE (V.O.)
                Don t get me wrong, I love my life.  I 
                guess I just worry about what I gave 
                up to get it.  I feel like in an 
                effort to  make it ... aka, 
                  assimilate... me and a lot of other 
                Black folks have lost a little bit of 
                  ourselves... And everybody else has 
                found it.  Just look around:

                And Asian guys are just un-holdable on 
                the dance floor!


      Dre, dressed, puts a PASTRY on a plate and sits at the table.

                                DRE (V.O.)
                Come on!  Big butts, R&B and dancing?! 
                We may not have wanted to admit it, but 
                those were the Black man s  Go-To s!  My 
                family thinks I m crazy but I tell  em 
                all the time, we re going out of style.  
                We re living in the last days of Disco 
                of it being cool to be Black.  


      DRE'S GRIMACE, remembering the moment, biting into his pastry.

                                DRE (V.O.)
                But it did kinda have its advantages.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Dre s reading the paper and eating his pastry as we left him.  
      His father, POPS, 60, enters and sits without saying a word. 

                                DRE (V.O.)
                Even though we were close, my Pops had 
                a weird way of showing he loved me...  

                                DRE
                Hey Pops.

                                POPS
                Jesus Christ!  Can I at least get a cup 
                of coffee in me before you start in?!  

                                DRE (V.O.)
                And by weird,  I meant he didn t do it 
                at all... 

      Pops takes the pastry off Dre s plate and starts to read his 
      newspaper.  ZOEY, 14, enters.  As usual, her head s buried in 
      her iPhone.  She sits down, takes the pastry from Pops  plate 
      and continues texting without saying a word to anyone.

                                DRE
                      (pointedly)
                Good morning, Zoey.

                                ZOEY
                      (still texting)
                Hey Daddy.
                      (then, looking up)
                Did you brush your teeth this morning?

                                DRE
                Yeah, why?

                                ZOEY
                      (duh)
                 Cause it smells like you didn t brush 
                your teeth this morning.   

                                POPS
                Did feel like a pretty straight 
                forward question, son.

                                ZOEY
                Right?  Like, why else would someone 
                ask someone that?      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       5.


      Pops and Zoey BUMP FIST.

                                DRE
                      (beat, then smiling)
                Nice try.  Both of you.  Not falling 
                for that one again.  

      As Zoey shrugs and goes back to texting and Pops goes back to 
      his paper, Dre inconspicuously SELF-TESTS his breath.  ANDRE 
      JR., 12, enters and POURS HIMSELF A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE. 

                                ANDRE JR.
                Mornin , Pops!  What s up, Dad!  

      Dre and Andre Jr. exchange their usual ROUTINE of a HAND-SLAP, 
      FIST-BUMP, and KISS ON THE CHEEK.  Pops looks on, disgusted.  

                                POPS
                For Christsakes!  Why don t you two 
                just go get a room?
                      (then, sotto)
                Can t believe I fought in  Nam and 
                Marched  on Washington for this.

                                DRE
                You shot yourself in the foot to avoid 
                the draft and you were in D.C. for an 
                Isley Brothers concert.

      Rainbow, dressed in scrubs, enters with the TWINS, JACK and 
      DIANE, 6, in tow.  She kisses Dre on the forehead.

                                RAINBOW
                Good morning, Mr. Vice President!

                                DRE
                Hear that, Pops?  Stevenson s 
                  announcing my VP promotion today.  

                                POPS
                Psh!  If you had gone and worked for 
                that Black firm like I told you, you d 
                have been Mr. President, five years ago. 

                                RAINBOW
                Yeah, but for like half the money.  

                                POPS
                So?  It s a Black company so you gotta 
                adjust for the Negro inflation tax.  That s 
                like making three, four times as much.

                                JACK
                      (sotto, to Diane)

                                DIANE
                      (sotto, to Jack)
                Talk to me again when he starts 
                  wandering away and pooping his pants.  

      Dre stands and addresses his wife and father.  

                                DRE
                You know what?  This job is about more 
                than just money for me.  As a VP at 
                one of the top ad agencies in the 
                world, I m gonna be breaking down 
                barriers and earning my respect.

                                RAINBOW
                Yes, absolutely honey, you re right.  
                Respect and barriers.  Equally important 
                to money.  But just so I m clear... 
                there is a salary increase, correct?

      Dre ignores Rainbow and turns to his Dad.

                                DRE
                Come on Pops, admit it.  You didn t 
                think I d make it.  

                                POPS
                Admit it?!  I tell you that everyday!  
                Why do you think I stay out there in 
                the guest house?  I need to be close 
                for when the other shoe drops.  

      Andre Jr. interrupts.

                                ANDRE JR.
                Dad, you think I can ride with you?  I 
                need to get to school a little early. 

                                DRE
                You re in luck, since I don t have to 
                drop Pops off at his weekly...
                      (doing air quotes)
                   massage  appointment.  I got time.

                      (re: Dre s air quotes)
                I don t know what all that s for.  
                Mama-San runs a legitimate business.

                                DRE
                Yeah, that moves every three months 
                and got shut down by Vice last week.        BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       7.


                                POPS

                She ll be back.   You ll see.
                      (wistfully, to himself)
                She ll be back.  

      Dre shakes his head at Pops as he and Andre Jr. head out.


      Dre and Andre Jr. are riding in the car. 

                                DRE 
                Why did you need to get to school 
                early, Junior?

                                ANDRE JR.
                Tryout s are today.  Wanted to get a 
                little extra work in so I d be ready.

      Dre beams over to Andre Jr., and nods proudly.

                                DRE
                Okay, okay!  I heard that!  Work on 
                your handle.  Make sure you lock up 
                that point guard spot. 

                                ANDRE JR.
                No point guards in Field Hockey, Dad.

                                DRE
                      (not getting it)
                Right, right.  True.  Definitely got a 
                point there.
                      (then)
                Not really sure what that at all has to 
                do with what we re talking about though.

                                ANDRE JR.
                That s what I m trying out for. 

                                DRE
                For Field Hockey?!  Isn t that a 
                woman s sport?

                                ANDRE JR.
                Nope.   Lotta people think that though.

                                DRE
                A lot of people do not think about 
                Field Hockey, Son! 
                      (then, hurt)
                What happened?!  We ve been hooping 
                together all summer!  I thought you

                The  Johnson Family What?   Dad, I 
                don t think I remember you hitting one 
                  jumpshot.  We had to change  HORSE  to 
                   EQUESTRIAN  and you still never gave 
                me an  E .

                      (beat, complete denial)
                I m not talking about the accuracy, 
                I m talking about the form!  The form 
                is what the family is known for.

                                ANDRE JR.
                Right.  Anyway, I thought about 
                playing hoop, but all my friends are 
                  Fee-Hocking it this year so I figured, 
                you know, when in Rome.

                                DRE
                You re not in Rome!  You re in L.A.  
                No one in L.A. plays field hockey!   

                                ANDRE JR.
                Not true.  It s a real sport, Dad.

                                DRE
                      (mocking)
                Oh, yeah?  It s a real sport?  Maybe  
                I ll catch a game tonight.  What 
                  channel s it on again?

                                ANDRE JR. 
                      (searching his phone)

      Dre throws his hands up, exasperated, as he pulls into the 
      DROP-OFF LINE at VALLEY PREP and Andre Jr. prepares to go 
      into the SEA OF WHITENESS that is his school.

                                DRE
                Okay, fine.  Not gonna let you ruin my 
                day.  You wanna play  Field Hockey  over 
                the greatest sport in the world?  Go for 
                it.  Least you re playing sports, right?  

                                ANDRE JR.
                Thanks Dad.      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       9.


      Andre Jr. grabs his bag and begins to EXIT THE CAR.  As he 
      does, a neighborhood friend, ZACH, 13, (White, laid back, 
      perpetually matter-of-fact) walks by. 

                                ZACH 
                What s up, Mr. J.  Sup, Andy!    

      Zach walks into the building as Dre glares back to his son 
      through the ROLLED DOWN CAR WINDOW.

                                DRE
                      (re: Zach)
                Andy?!

                                ANDRE JR.
                Nice, right?  I think it says;  I m 
                edgy... but approachable.   

                                DRE
                I think it says;  I m an idiot... who 
                plays Field Hockey.  
                      (then)
                Andy s not even a derivative of Andre!

                                ANDRE JR.
                  Derivative or not, that s my new 
                handle and I think the ship s sailed 
                on it.  Nicknames have a lot of 
                  stickiness.  
                      (then`)
                And to be honest Dad, Andre s your 
                name.  It s who you are.  I ve never 
                really felt like it fit me.

                                DRE
                You re twelve!  You don t know what 
                fits you!  When we went to buy shoes, 
                the salesman said you ve been wearing 
                sneakers that were 3 sizes too small!

                                ANDRE JR.
                  I thought I was tying them too tight.  
                Still doesn t mean I m a Dre though. 
                      (then, getting ready to go)
                Oh and don t forget, we have to talk 
                about what we re going to do for my 
                birthday party next week.  

                                DRE
                Maybe I can find you a  throwback  
                Field  Hockey Jersey to wear to it.

                                ANDRE JR.
                Pssh... Yeah, good luck with that.  It s 
                mostly a European sport so getting--      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       10.


      Dre ROLLS UP THE WINDOW and and shakes his head, disgusted, 
      as he drives off from Andre Jr. and WE GO TO:


      Jean Knight s  Mr. Big Stuff  SCORES as Dre makes his way 
      through the lobby and is greeted by ALL, but none more fondly 
      than the other BLACK EMPLOYEES (SECURITY GUARDS, JANITORS, 
      MAIL ROOM GUYS, etc.)  

                                DRE (V.O.)
                There were so few of us at Relevant that 
                being Black made you feel like you were 
                part of a little family.  So when one of 
                us made it, it was kind of like we all 
                did.  And right now, I was that one.  
                I m not saying I was the Jackie Robinson 
                of Relevant Advertising or anything.  
                But, I mean, if other people were saying 
                it, they wouldn t be wrong.

      Dre exchanges a flurry of different but equally impactful 
      'HEAD NODS', 'FIST PUMPS', and 'WHAT UP'S' with his  FAMILY.     


      Dre enters and is greeted by his assistant, KRIS LEVINE, 23.  

                                KRIS
                Drizzy Dre, what up?!  Or should I say 
                Mr. Vee-Peezy?!

      Dre and Kris do complicated, but well practiced, HANDSHAKE.  

                                DRE (V.O.)
                This is my assistant, Kris.  Notice 
                how I do the shake with him?  For the 
                 good ones  you don t mind sprinkling 
                a li l something here and there.

                                DRE
                Yo, Kris, let ask you a question?  Did 
                you want to play the same sport your 
                Dad did in High School?

                                KRIS
                You kidding me?  Of course!  My Dad  
                was an friggin  Field Hockey God!

      Dre ROLLS HIS EYES as a White co-worker, JOSH, 40, pops in.        BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       11.


                                JOSH
                Yo, Dr. Dre!  

                                DRE
                Or just Andre... Just Andre s fine, too.

                                DRE (V.O.)
                This is Josh.  Not one of the good ones.  

                                JOSH
                Right.  Sorry.  Andre... 
                      (then)
                Hey bro--  I mean, Andre.  We re 
                working on this Folgers copy and 
                wanted to know how you think a Black 
                guy would say,  Good morning ?  

                                DRE
                Um... I m thinking, probably just like 
                that.  But let s pitch on it later.  

                                JOSH
                Cool bro !  I mean, Dre--  Andre!

      Josh starts to head out, but then turns around.

                                JOSH (CONT D)
                Oh yeah.  Stevenson called a meeting.  
                Sounds like something big might be up.  

      Dre looks to Kris, knowingly, then to Josh.  

                                DRE
                Really?  Big?   That s what people are 
                saying?  I ve been hearing  historic  
                and  game changing  tossed around, but 
                who knows.  Probably just office gossip.  

      Josh furrows, confused, as Dre smiles, smugly, and we, GO TO: 


      The meeting is in full swing.  The boss, MR. STEVENSON, (60, 
      White, nouveau-liberal, voted for Barack... the second time) 
      addresses the EMPLOYEES, seated around the conference table.  

                                DRE (V.O.) 
                When it came to the advertising game, 
                Relevant was in a league of its own.    I 
                was damn lucky to be there. But like many 
                  companies, Relevant had a long-standing 
                history of an US vs. THEM mentality.

      The room is split by a CLEAR LINE OF SEGREGATION.  On ONE 
      SIDE of the table, the MINORITIES.        BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       12.


      Underneath them a CHYRON reads:  US.   On the OTHER SIDE, the 
      WHITE EMPLOYEES, who  underneath a CHYRON reads:  THEM.     

                                DRE (V.O.) 
                That's why this promotion was such a 
                big deal.  For once, one of 'US' was 
                gonna get a chance to be one of 'THEM.   

      ANGLE ON: Dre's smiling face as he IMAGINES THIS MOMENT.  

      INSERT: With a quick  DING,  we see Dre and Josh SWAP SEATS.  
      Dre, now seated on the 'THEM' side, has his LEGS KICKED UP on 
      the table EATING SNACKS.  Off DRE S SMILING FACE, we,

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:


      DRE S SMILING FACE, still daydreaming as Mr. Stevenson stands.

                                MR. STEVENSON
                Alright guys, I m sure all of you have 
                heard that I have an announcement. 

                                DRE
                Shh!  Quiet everyone!  Mr. Stevenson 
                has an announcement!  No idea what it 
                could be.  Probably pretty huge though.

                                MR. STEVENSON
                Myself along with the board have 
                decided to up a new VP in the company.  

                                DRE
                What?!  Oh my God, that s crazy!  But 
                wise.  Very wise.  Kudos to you, sir.  

      Dre STANDS and starts a SOLO SLOW-CLAP.  Off Mr. Stevenson s 
      GLARE, he sits.

                                MR. STEVENSON
                  Relevant s one of the fastest growing 
                  advertising companies in the world.  But 
                the world's demos are changing and we 
                want to be the leader of that change...

      As Mr. Stevenson continues to talk, Dre eagerly, yet subtly, 
      begins to GATHER HIS THINGS, STAND, and WALK from the  US  
      side of the table to the  THEM  side of the table.  Dre is 
      now on the  THEM  side of the table, attempting to squeeze 
      into an EMPTY CHAIR next to Josh.  

                                DRE
                      (sotto)
                If I could just squeeze in there--      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       13.


                                MR. STEVENSON
                And that's why, without any further 
                ado, I'd like everyone to give a warm 
                  congrats, to the VP of our new Urban 
                  Division, Andre Johnson!

      Off this announcement Dre is STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS. 

                                DRE
                I m sorry.  Did you say,  Urban? 

      On Dre s shocked and confused face, we GO TO,


      The entire Johnson family, including Pops, eats a buffet 
      style dinner.  Rainbow stands, RAISING HER GLASS.

                                RAINBOW
                To my husband, the VP!  

      As everyone TOASTS, Dre sits, noticeably UNENTHUSIASTIC. 

                                POPS
                Yes, congrats to my son.  Finally made 
                it to Head Puppet of the White man.  
                      (raising his glass)
                To you.

                                RAINBOW
                Nice, Pops.  You re supposed to be 
                here helping celebrate.

                                POPS
                  Actually, you told me I was coming over 
                to eat fried chicken. 
                      (re: chicken)
                I don t know what the hell this is.  

                                RAINBOW
                It s fried chicken.  Baked  fried 
                chicken.  

      Pops looks at his chicken, then to Dre, furious.

                                POPS
                      (to Dre, re: chicken)
                You dirty mother--!

                                RAINBOW
                Pops!

                                DRE
                No, he s right.  I feel like a sell out.
                      (then)
                                (MORE)      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       14.

                                DRE (CONT'D)
                I said I wanted to be Relevant s first 
                Black VP.  But really, I wanted to be 
                their first VP who happened to be Black.  

                                RAINBOW
                What difference does it make?!  
                Obama s the first Black President.  Is 
                he any less the President?

                                DRE
                No, because he s the first Black 
                  President of the United States.  Not 
                the first Black President of extra 
                clean Air Jordan s or wave caps.  

                                JACK
                Obama s the first Black President?

                                POPS
                      (to Dre, re: Jack)
                Really doing a bang up job over here.  

      Dre turns to Rainbow, irritated.

                                RAINBOW
                Hold on, let s explore this.  Jack, you 
                really didn t know Barack Obama was our 
                first Black President?

                                JACK
                Um, not really.  I mean, he s the only 
                  president I ve ever known.

                                RAINBOW
                Okay!  There!  He s the only one!  That 
                explains his lack of Presidential trivia.

                                DRE
                  Presidential trivia?  I didn t ask what 
                Obama s first goldfish was named! 
                      (then)
                What s the point of putting up with 
                what I put up with at work just to be 
                able to afford to send our kids to 
                private school, if they don t even know 
                Barack s the first Black president?

                                DIANE
                Tootie! 
                      (off their looks)
                Obama s first goldfish s name was Tootie.  

                                RAINBOW
                Very good, sweetie.  Now why don t 
                you and Jack go get ready for bed?      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       15.


      Diane gets up, followed by Jack.  Jack whispers to his sister.

                                JACK 
                How did you know Obama s fish s name?

                                DIANE
                  I didn t.  Nice, right? 

      As the twins leave, Andre Jr. crosses over to his parents.  

                                ANDRE JR.
                Great as this has been, I got FH try-outs 
                tomorrow and I want to be fresh.  Plus, I 
                got moved to the front leg of Danny 
                  Segalbaum s Hora chair for his Bar Mitzah 
                this weekend and he s got quite the 
                tuchis, so I m gonna need my strength. 

      As Andre Jr. exits, Dre turns to Rainbow.

                                DRE
                You wanna  explore  that, too?  

                                RAINBOW
                Danny Segalbaum has Type II Diabetes so 
                that could explain his tuchis size.   

                                DRE
                Of course you think this is funny.  
                You re not the one at fault.

                What?  What are you talking about? 

                                DRE
                My kids look at me going to my job and 
                being a sell out everyday, how can I 
                expect anything more from them?

      Dre shakes his head and crosses out.  Rainbow turns to Pops.

                                RAINBOW
                Jeez!  For once, all I wanted to do was 
                have a nice dinner with my family and 
                  celebrate a good thing like normal people.  
                Guess we don t all get what we want.  

                                POPS
                Damn right, if we did, I d be eating 
                fried fried chicken right now.

      Pops exits.  Off Rainbow s incredulous face, we:
                                                                            FADE OUT.

                                  END OF ACT ONE      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       16.


                                        ACT TWO


      Rainbow enters from work to find Dre on the couch looking at 
      old family pictures on his Apple TV. 

                                RAINBOW
                What are you doing home?

                                DRE
                Took the day off.  Wanted to remember 
                my life the way it used to be.

                                RAINBOW
                Oh, okay.  Makes sense.  Usually what 
                people do the day after they re promoted.  

                                DRE
                Don t start  Bow, please.  

                                RAINBOW
                Oh my God!  Would you please stop this 
                pity party?  So they added  Urban  on 
                your job title.  Boo hoo.  
                      (off Dre s look)
                What?  You think I don t go through 
                all kind of stuff like this being a 
                female doctor.  Come on, it s still an 
                amazing job.  Keep it real.  

      Off Bow, Dre sits up and shoots her a DEATH STARE.  

                                DRE
                 Keep it real?    Keep it real?!   I m 
                 Mr. Keep It Real!   You re the one that 
                doesn t  keep it real.   In fact, you 
                keep it so unreal, you shouldn t even be 
                allowed to question my realness.  

                                RAINBOW 
                Annd, here we go.

                                DRE
                And if we re really keeping it all the 
                way real, you re mixed!  Or biracial.  
                Or omnicolored.  Or whatever they re 
                calling it today.  Point is, you re 
                not even really Black, so...

                                RAINBOW
                Well if I m not really Black then 
                somebody needs to tell my hair and my 
                complete lack of fiscal responsibility!       BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       17.


                                DRE 
                You don t get it!  Not only am I a 
                joke at work, but I ve let my family 
                get lost in all this craziness.  I m 
                raising a son that doesn t want to 
                play the game that s not only given 
                Black Men more TV time than COPS but 
                that his father dominated at--

                                RAINBOW
                  I thought you didn t make the team?

                                DRE
                That was political!  I won three 
                  intramural championships!  
                      (then)
                Point is my boy s playing Yuppy Stick 
                Ball and just got moved to the front of 
                some fat kid s Bar Mitzah thingee! 

                                RAINBOW
                Hora.  
                      (then, off his look)
                Sorry.  I m just not understanding 
                what any of this has to do with you?

                                DRE
                Don t you see?  We re both trapped in 
                the White Matrix.  Mine is Relevant.  
                His is Valley Prep.  It s time to take 
                the blue pill, babe.

                                RAINBOW
                That s the one that keeps you in The 
                Matrix.

                                DRE
                Okay, the green pill.

                                RAINBOW
                There was no green pill.

                                DRE
                I get it!  You ve seen the movie!  All 
                I m saying is I want us to take 
                  whichever color that stops making us 
                  outsiders trying to fit in.

                                RAINBOW
                  Outsider?!  What are you talking 
                about?  Relevant made you into a VP!   
                And I m sorry Dre, but not 
                  everything s about you being Black.

      Off Rainbow, Dre looks at her, INCREDULOUS, as WE GO TO:      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       18.



      TWO CAPTAINS are selecting teams from a GROUP OF 6'5 , 
      ATHLETIC WHITE GUYS gathered in front of them, and Dre.  Team 
      Captain #1 scans his athletic White options but then narrows 
      his gaze on Dre, who SNACKS ON CHIPS, then TAKES A PUFF ON 
      HIS ASTHMA INHALER.  

                                CAPTAIN #1
                I got homeboy.  With the Fritos.  

      Dre cuts an INCREDULOUS LOOK to Rainbow, sitting in the bleachers.  


      Dre is lying on a patient table in linens.  Rainbow sits on 
      the chair next to him as the DOCTOR speaks to him.  

                                DOCTOR
                It's unlikely, but there s a chance it 
                could be sickle cell.  

                                DRE  
                You're getting this from a sprained 
                ankle? 

      Dre gives Rainbow his familiar LOOK OF INCREDULITY as we,

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:


      DRE INCREDULOUSLY STARING at Rainbow.

                                RAINBOW
                Ok, those might not have been the best 
                  examples.

      Rainbow and Dre s argument is interrupted as Jack and Diane enter 
      from school with Pops.  They cross and greet their parents.        BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       19.


                                JACK
                Mommy!  Liza Jackson asked if Diane 
                and I can have a play date with her.

                                DIANE
                She s weird, so feel free to say no.

                                RAINBOW
                Liza Jackson?  Which one is she again? 

                                DIANE
                You know... wears the Nemo shoes?  
                Every.  Single.  Day.

                                JACK
                And the polka dot backpack.  

                                DIANE
                Kinda smells like a turkey burger.

                                JACK
                No, like chili!

                                DRE
                      (realizing)
                Hold up!  Wait a second.  Are you guys 
                talking about the only other little 
                Black girl in your class?  

      Jack and Diane contemplate, then NOD their heads,  Yes.   

                                DRE (CONT D)
                Why didn t you just say that?

                                DIANE
                I dunno?  Guess when I hear  Liza Jackson  
                I just think Nemo and turkey burgers.  

      As Jack and Diane cross off, Dre turns to Rainbow, incensed.  

                                RAINBOW
                What?!  They don t see color.  Don t 
                you think that s beautiful?

                                DRE
                No, I think we need to get them tested!

                                POPS
                      (re: Jack and Diane)
                But when I say it, I m wrong?  

      Rainbow cuts Pops a GLARE.  He throws his hands up and 
      crosses to the bathroom as Andre Jr. in full Field Hockey 
      uniform enters home from try-outs with Zach.      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       20.


                                ANDRE JR.
                I made the team!

                                DRE
                        (incredulous)
                Of course you did.

      Andre Jr. sits at the kitchen table as Zach nonchalantly 
      crosses to the refrigerator, OPENS it, and begins RUMMAGING.

                                DRE (CONT'D)
                Uh, Zach, did you need something?

                                ZACH
                Yeah, I ve been craving grape soda all 
                day and my parents never buy any.

                                DRE
                And why in the hell would you assume--

                                ZACH
                Got it! 
                      (holding up a grape soda)
                Thanks Mr. J.  Mrs. J.  Later Andy!

      Dre grabs his head in pain off Zach calling Dre  Andy .  As Zach 
      exits and Pops crosses back in, Dre GLARES to Andre Jr.  Before 
      he can say anything, Zoey, on her cell phone, crosses in. 

                                ZOEY
                      (into phone)
                Hold on, Margo. 
                      (then)
                Mom.  Dad.  Margo s going to a 'Jason 
                Mraz' acoustic jam on Saturday.  Can I 
                go?  Please?  Phillip Phillips is 
                gonna beat box as his opener.

      Dre shoots Zoey a blank look but before he can respond Andre 
      Jr., taking  air shots  with his Field Hockey stick, interrupts.

                                ANDRE JR. 
                Oh, and Dad, me and some of the  Field 
                Mob  decided what I should do for my 
                birthday party... I want to have a Bar 
                Mitzah!  
                      (off Dre s look)
                Before you say anything.  I know we re 
                not Jewish, but Zach knows a Rabbi who s 
                great at pushing through conversions.

                                DRE
                So you d be willing to forsake your 
                own religion just for a party?       BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       21.


                                ANDRE JR.
                Short answer?  Yes.  All the attention.  
                The actual cash instead of crappy Barnes 
                and Nobles gift cards.  And the 
                  entertainment?  Oy! 
                      (then)
                David Blaine performed at Isaac 
                  Barnow s!  He gave Isaac s mom, Isaac s 
                dad s  secret  cell phone number that 
                nobody, including his mom, had.  It was 
                epic!  When you left that party, you 
                might not have believed in marriage 
                anymore, but there was no questioning 
                whether or not magic was real. 

                                DRE
                Well, Isaac may be lucky enough to get 
                  magician s to destroy his parents  
                lives, but you get other stuff.

                                ANDRE JR.
                Like what?

                                POPS
                      (jumping in, offended)
                Like making it home alive everyday!
                      (then)
                White folks won t tell you this, but it s 
                a known fact that 68% of Black men will 
                die before the age of 14 from a knife 
                wound to the throat on their way home.

      Dre looks at his father, a bit exasperated.

                                DRE
                Pops, I know you re trying to help, but 
                you can t just pull random, terrifying 
                stats that  White folks don t want you to 
                know  out your ass like you did with us.  
                Kids have Google now.

                                POPS
                And who in the hell do you think 
                created Google?

                                ANDRE JR.
                Larry Page and Sergey Brin. 
                      (holding up his phone)
                Just Googled it... On the iPhone I got 
                from Isaac Barnow s Bar Mitzvah.

                                POPS
                      (beat, to Dre, re: Andre Jr.)
                You need to whoop him.  Two times.      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       22.


      Dre turns to Rainbow, desperate.

                                DRE
                Are you hearing any of this?

                                RAINBOW
                Junior, you re not converting.

                                ANDRE JR.
                Why not, Ma?  And now that I think 
                about it, if I do, it won t matter 
                what my nickname is because when I 
                convert I ll get a Hebrew name.
                      (then)
                I m thinking I m gonna go with either 
                   Schlomo  or  Shmuel .  They re both 
                pretty solid, so I don t think I can go 
                wrong.

                                DRE
                      (beat, then exploding)
                That s it! 
                      (then, calling out)
                Family meeting!  Kitchen!  NOW!

                                POPS
                Uh oh!  I smell a 'group hug' or a 
                'mass time out' coming on.

                                DRE
                Not this time.

      Off Dre, having had enough, we GO TO,


      The FAMILY minus Pops, is seated in a modest (as far as Home 
      Theatre s go) Home Theatre Room.  Dre, pacing back in forth 
      in front of the MUTED SCREEN which is playing Spike Lee s, 
       Malcolm X , turns to his family, all business.

                                DRE
                Listen up!  Now I know I ve been 
                  complaining a lot about my job, but 
                this family s my number one priority 
                and I can t expect things at work to 
                change if my home s in shambles.  

                                ZOEY
                      (into phone)
                Oh!  So they re beat boxing together?

                                DRE
                Zoey, hang up the phone!      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       23.


                                ZOEY
                      (into phone)
                I ll text you Margo. 

      Zoey hangs up the phone but IMMEDIATELY BEGINS TEXTING.

                                DRE
                From now on, we re not playing by 
                anybody else s rules but our own.  And 
                thanks to your mother, I now know what 
                our new rule is; We re keeping it real!  

                                JACK
                Mommy, I m scared.

                                DRE
                You don t have to be scared, big guy.  
                But what you guys do have to start 
                doing, is describing people using 
                racial identifications. 

                                DIANE
                Okay, now I m with Jack.

                                DRE
                      (ala a Newscaster)
                 The assailant was an Hispanic male 
                between the ages of ten and sixty. 
                      (then, to Twins)
                See?  Now I know who I m looking for.  

      Dre turns to Andre Jr.

                                DRE (CONT D)
                And Junior... If I hear anybody calling 
                you Schlomo or Shmuel or especially Andy, 
                I m gonna back over you and whoever s 
                calling you it, in my car.

                                ANDRE JR.
                Dad--

                                DRE
                I m not finished!  I may have to come 
                watch you play possibly the world s 
                dumbest sport, but I don t have to 
                keep writing you eighteen dollar 
                checks and hearing you rave about 
                other kids  Bar Mitzvah s.  
                      (then)
                Next Saturday, for your 13th birthday, 
                you become a man too.  A Black man.  
                I m throwing you an African Rites of 
                Passage Ceremony.      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       24.


                                ANDRE JR.
                      (beat)
                That does not sound as fun.

      Dre turns to Zoey who s SNAPPING A SELFIE and lowers his 
      head, resigned.

                                DRE
                And Zoey... It s too late for you, 
                baby.  Just let me know how much the 
                tickets are and don t get pregnant.  

                                ZOEY
                Cool!  Hey can I ask your opinion 
                about these two Instagram filters?

                                DRE
                      (beat)
                Later.

      Zoey, oblivious, shoots her Dad a  thumbs up  and goes back 
      to texting.  

                                RAINBOW
                Dre, this is ridic--

                                DRE
                -- Bow.  You were right.

                                RAINBOW
                Excuse me?

                                DRE
                You were right!  I m going to go into 
                Relevant tomorrow, give my concept 
                  presentation, and keep it real as fuck 
                with them. 

                                RAINBOW
                Don t think that s exactly what I said. 
                      (then)
                Babe, listen, I know this job thing 
                has you a bit out of sorts, but Urban 
                Division or not, this position is a 
                huge deal and you should be proud.

                                DRE
                I am.  I m totally over it.  Totally.

                                RAINBOW
                Oh.  Well... good.  Because I know how 
                you can get and I wanted to make sure 
                you weren t going to go into work and 
                do something stupid.       BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       25.


                                DRE
                If RELEVANT wants an  Urban VP , than 
                that's what they're going to get. 

                                RAINBOW
                Right.  So... you're not over it and 
                you definitely are going to do 
                  something stupid.  Got it.

      Dre, with a manic glare, begins nodding his head knowingly.

                                DRE (V.O.)
                I knew my new  Keeping it Real  regime of 
                nonstop, pure, uncut realness wasn't 
                gonna be easy, but I was dedicated and 
                ready to do whatever it took to get me 
                and my family back on track.

      As family sits slack jawed at Dre s announcement we CUT TO,

      INSERT:  Over the aggressive, hardcore, bass line of Dead 
      Prez's,  Hip-Hop,  we see ICONIC, REVOLUTIONARY IMAGES from 
      moments of social upheaval throughout Black history (i.e. the 
      classic photo of a boy being bit by a dog in Birmingham, video 
      footage of Civil Rights marchers being hosed, video footage of 
      Muhammad Ali angrily speaking to an audience of Black Muslims, 
      and for some reason there's even a clip of SHAQ DUNKING ON CHRIS 
      DUDLEY).  As the music SLOWLY FADES, we HOLD on one last image, 
      the INDELIBLE SHOT of MALCOLM X LOOKING OUT OF HIS WINDOW 
      HOLDING AN M-1 CARBINE RIFLE.  This image, along with the 
      screen, then suddenly FADES TO BLACK.  After a beat, a CHYRON 
      over the black reads:  SAMSUNG - GALAXY BRIGHT   Off this, WE,


      PULL OUT to see we ve been watching a FLAT SCREEN MONITOR.  
      As the LIGHTS COME ON the camera PANS to see that Dre has 
      just presented this pitch to Mr. Stevenson and the other 
      BOSSES.  Dre stands looking on DEFIANTLY as a mix of 
      LEGITIMATE FEAR and ANGER is plastered across the faces of 
      his BOSSES.  Off this WE,

                                                                            FADE OUT.
                                END OF ACT TWO      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       26.


                                      ACT THREE


      The entire Johnson family, including Pops, is riding in a 
      stretched limo.  Dre and Andre Jr. are again dressed in 
      traditional African garb.  Surprisingly, this time, so is 
      Pops.  Andre Jr. looks as if he s about to have a stroke.

                                ANDRE JR.
                Come on Dad, seriously, do we really 
                have to go through with this?

                                DRE
                 Fraid so, son.        BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       32.


      Pops lights a leaf of sage and begins waving it around Andre Jr.  

                                POPS
                Be still, boy.  This is sage.  Get the 
                bad spirits off you.  

                                ANDRE JR.
                Come on Pops, you too?  But we re not 
                African, remember?

                                POPS
                Hey, when in Rome.  

                                ANDRE JR.
                But this is L.A.!    
                      (then)
                Okay, fine.  But if I step out of the 
                car like this, I m cooked at school. 

      Dre pulls a box from under the seats and hands it to Andre Jr.  

                                ANDRE JR. (CONT D)
                Then maybe you should put this on.  

      Andre Jr. OPENS THE BOX and finds a RED ADIDAS TRACKSUIT, a 
      pair of SHELL TOE ADIDAS, and a BLACK KANGOL HAT.  He looks 
      at his father, confused.  Off this we, 


      As we PULL OUT from the IMAGE we once again see being viewed on a 
      FLATSCREEN MONITOR, and Dre is back at RELEVANT, playing a new 
      version of the Samsung ad for the RELEVANT Advertising execs, 
      including Mr. Stevenson, who STAND AND APPLAUD, obviously pleased 
      by what they ve just seen.  As Dre walks around the room 
      accepting congratulations and handshakes, he speaks to us:  

                                DRE (V.O.)
                So taking a cue from my very wise son, 
                  I decided to get my foot in the door 
                and really make some noise.  And just 
                like that I became the sell-out, Head 
                Puppet VP of Relevant Advertsing s 
                Urban Division.  


      Dre, proudly, sits at his desk as MAINTENANCE puts his NAME 
      and TITLE,  VP - URBAN DIVISION  on his new OFFICE DOOR. 

                                DRE (V.O.)
                Funny thing is, I still didn't feel 
                much like a sell out.

      As Dre sits at his desk, he takes and places THE SAME PICTURE 
      WE SAW FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW on his desk.  We ANGLE 
      and HOLD on this picture as we MATCH CUT TO:
