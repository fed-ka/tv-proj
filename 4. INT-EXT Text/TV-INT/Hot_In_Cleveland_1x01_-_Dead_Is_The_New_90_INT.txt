    ATTENTION-GETTING HAT, IS VICTORIA TROUSDALE, WHO IS NOISILY 
  TYPING ON HER BLACKBERRY.  NEXT TO HER AND READING A NOVEL IS

                My agent said there might be an 

                audition for me.  It s so hard to find 

                good roles in your late thirties.

                Honor Saint Raven for the last twenty-

                seven years has been a privilege, and 

                it s always gratifying to meet those I 

                have touched and moved.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT

                  Actually, what I was going to ask was, 

                 Are you comfortable ?  Can I get you 

                a pillow?

                                        VICTORIA

                Melanie, listen to me: romantic 

                comedies are like cellulite cures -- 

                every one of them is a lie.  Women 

                watch them because they enjoy being 

                lied to.  In real life, Jack Nicholson 

                and Keanu Reeves do not fight over 

                Diane Keaton.

  MELANIE TRIES TO HOLD BACK TEARS, BUT THEY JUST START COMING.

                                        MELANIE

                I wanted to feel young and stupid.  

                Instead I just feel stupid.  (THROUGH 

                TEARS) And old.   

                                          JOY

                You re not old.  Forty is the new 

                  twenty-five.

                                        MELANIE

                I thought forty was the new thirty.

                                          JOY

                Well, if we re just gonna make crap 

                up, I d rather be twenty-five.

                You hurt Melanie.  And no one should 

                ever hurt Melanie.

                                          HANK

                I know.  I really do.  And there s 

                nothing I can say to make this right.  

                I lied.  But I also told the truth.  

                Last night really was the best night 

                of my life, or at least the best night 

                I can remember in a long, long time.  

                I didn t go to that bar with this in 

                mind... but then these three 

                incredible women came to our table.

                                        VICTORIA

                Go on.

                                          HANK

                And, Melanie, you were so 

                  breathtakingly out of my league and I 

                couldn t stop myself.  When you re a 

                kid you think, oh, that opportunity 

                will come again.  But then you get to 

                be my age and you think maybe not.   

                You women are beautiful and 

                  sophisticated.  I m just a plumber 

                from Cleveland in a bad marriage who 

                hurt someone who never should be hurt.

  THE WOMEN CAN T HELP IT.  THEY RE ALL CHARMED BY HIM.  HOT IN CLEVELAND   "DEAD IS THE NEW 90"       44.

                Well, for sophisticated ladies, we 

                probably shouldn t have burst in on 

                you like that.

                                          HANK

                No, it does you credit.  You were 

                  concerned about your friend.  

                                        VICTORIA

                It s true.  When one of us needs help,
