      Ceiling fans rattle as Eric urgently enters the dingy office.  
      SHERMAN (50s, permanently sweaty and put upon) looks up from 
      his old PC.  

                                    SHERMAN
                    You re sure amped up.  Did you get 
                    hot sauce on your balls again?

                                  ERIC
                          (holds up bag)
                    Primo intelligence.  I m finally 
                    hitting my stride.  What s going on 
                    here?

                                    SHERMAN
                    High drama.  A cow climbed up the 
                    stairs onto the roof.

      Eric walks to a door, slides his ID card through a hidden 
      electronic reader and pulls it open.  He motions inside.

                                  ERIC
                    Don t worry.  There ll be an 
                    opening in here soon.  

                                    SHERMAN
                    No, no.  I don t belong in the 
                      plantation house.  I m happy here 
                    in the fields, singing my 
                      spirituals.

      Eric enters the closet as we hear Sherman s voice trail off.

                                    SHERMAN (CONT'D)
                    Swing low...sweet chariot...                                                                                       2.



      Eric enters a sleek command center built into an old hotel 
      (The Station).  Above the RECEPTIONIST hangs a seal that 
      reads: CIA, ALTAMARA STATION: 50 Years of Spreading Freedom.   

      He moves down a hallway as MIA (20s, pretty, no-bullshit), 
      comes the other way.  He smiles and raises the bag.

                                  ERIC
                    Last week the rebel leadership had 
                    a secret meeting.  They made a 
                      video...and I got it.

      He pulls out a VHS tape out of the bag.  He s annoyed.

                                  ERIC (CONT D)
                    Who still uses VHS?  Do we even 
                    have a player?

                                  MIA
                    In the small conference room.

      A group gathered around a cubicle bursts into LAUGHTER.  

                                  MIA (CONT D)
                          (off Eric s reaction)
                    Larry s showing clips from his 
                     best of surveillance  compilation.
                          (glances over)
                    Oh,  kitten in the bordello  -- I 
                    love this one.  So cute.  

      She rushes to the cubicle as Eric walks down to the empty 
      conference room.  As he s about to enter a voice calls out.

                                  STAN (O.S.)
                    Where do you think you re going?

      STAN (nerdy, intense) rises from his desk and rushes over.

                                  STAN (CONT D)
                    Does anyone read my memos?!  All 
                      conference rooms must be signed out 
                    with me.  Otherwise, we have chaos.  

      Stan pulls the door closed and locks it.

                                  ERIC
                    But no one s in there --

                                  STAN
                    Ted reserved it from 1  til 2:30.                                                                                       3.


      Eric looks over to an office marked  Ted Gannon, Head of 
      Station .  Through the glass TED (60s, gruff) leans back, 
      phone at his ear, blowing a ping-pong ball above his mouth.

                                  ERIC
                    Can t we assume he ll be busy for --

                                  STAN
                    In espionage one doesn t assume.
                    Effective station procedures are 
                    the foundation on which America s 
                      intelligence successes are built.  

      Stan settles back into his desk.

                                  STAN (CONT'D)
                    But I won t take your shoddiness 
                      personally since you re the  new 
                    guy.  You don t know any better.
                          (smiles condescendingly)
                    I mean one doesn t blame the infant 
                    for the soiled diapers.  

      He turns back to his work. 

                                  MIA (O.S.)
                    Who s making copies of their 
                    memoirs on the company Xerox!?

      Stan races to investigate.  Eric hears Mia WHISTLE from the 
      conference room.  She s picked the lock and motions him over.


      We see grainy video of REBELS in fatigues, ammo belts and 
      Castro beards playing the plastic instruments of  Rock Band. 

                                  REBELS
                          (heavy Hispanic accents)
                    Anyway you want it!  That s the way 
                    you need it!  Anyway you want it!

       Eric watches stone faced, while Mia bounces with the music.

                                  ERIC
                    I paid eight hundred dollars out of 
                    pocket for this.

      Suddenly Stan bursts in with fury in his eyes.

                                  ERIC (CONT D)
                    I m sorry, Stan!  It was 
                      potentially actionable intel - I 
                    couldn t wait.  Top priority.                                                                                      4.


      Stan glances to the TV as the rebels enter the guitar solo 
      portion of the song.  He turns and stares daggers at Eric.


      Eric, now deflated, emerges into the run-down Oceana offices.

                                    SHERMAN
                    You look like crap.  I feel better. 

                                  ERIC
                    This is a dead-end post, isn t it?

      Sherman doesn t answer, just starts singing.

                                    SHERMAN
                    Swing low...sweet chariot.

      Eric steps up to the window and stares out wistfully.

                                  ERIC
                    A buddy from my training class got 
                    placed in the Kabul station. Real 
                    enemies, no budget oversight, tea 
                    every afternoon and free kabobs on 
                    Fridays. Plus it s on the career 
                    fast track.  And me?  I m stuck --

      Suddenly, GUN SHOTS ring out.  Eric s eyes widen with 
      adrenaline as he draws his .45 from his shoulder holster.

                                  ERIC (CONT D)
                    Rebel attack!

      Then, an agonized  MOO  fills the air.  A beat later, a huge 
      COW plummets past the outside window.  It lands with a CRASH 
      on the street below.  Nonplussed, Sherman looks up at Eric.

                                    SHERMAN
                    They can t walk down stairs.  What 
                    else can you do?

      A disappointed Eric re-holsters his gun.  He looks out the 
      window to see that the cow has landed on the back of a black 
      hearse, its four hooves pointed straight up at the sky.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

                                            ACT ONE


      Ted addresses the station (Mia, Larry, Stan, and others).

                                  TED
                    We ve been commanded to give this 
                    country the President it needs.  
                          (beat, smiles)
                    For most of you, this will be your 
                    first election op.  Trust me, 
                    they re a helluva lot of fun.  We 
                    did a ton of these babies back in 
                    the 70s.
                          (laughs at a memory)
                      I remember one time we ended up on 
                      a cigarette boat, off Tierra del 
                    Fuego, with a dead Argentine 
                      opposition leader.  And Kenny 
                      Wheaton...you guys ever work with 
                    Kenny?  He s a real hell-raiser.  
                    Anyways, he takes a can of kerosene 
                    and a fishing net and --

      Ted notices the room is watching him blank faced.

                                  TED (CONT D)
                    Ask me about it over drinks.
                          (motions to the back)
                    Start it up.

      A title fades up on a projection screen: OPERATION: 
      FANTASTIC.  Antonio pipes in.

                                    ANTONIO
                    Operation Fantastic?  Are we 
                    putting on a musical?  

                                  TED
                    Langley likes op names to reflect 
                      positivity and optimism.                                                                                      6.

                    So I guess  Operation: Rig the 
                    Election  is out.

      Stan raises his hand.

                                  STAN
                    We re rigging the election?  I 
                    thought the agency didn t do stuff 
                    like that anymore.  I don t know 
                    that I m comfortable with --

      Suddenly, Ted launches at Stan and yanks him from the chair.

                                  TED
                    Man up, Stan!  Man up!

      Ted swings his hand down and grabs Stan s balls.

                                  STAN
                    Please don t.

                                  TED
                    These are marshmallows.  You hear 
                    me?  Marshmallows!

      He releases Stan then turns to the group.

                                  TED (CONT D)
                    Let me be clear:  Operation 
                    Fantastic demands iron balls.  
                          (beat)
                    We re going  old fashioned  on this 
                    one.  That might mean buying a few 
                    people s votes or it might mean 
                    yanking out a dissenter s tongue 
                    just to set an example.  So if 
                    that s...

                     outside your comfort zone  or  not 
                    where you re at  get the hell out.

      His glare scans the room.  Three people start to get up.

                                  TED (CONT D)
                    Sit down!

      Everyone sinks back in their seats.

                                  TED (CONT D)
                    Good.  We re all in this together.

      He then notices an empty seat near the back.                                                                                      7.

                    Where the hell is Eric?

      We push in on Stan, with a slight smirk.

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:


      Stan hums Vader s Theme from Star Wars while clicking through 
      an email account that reads   Eric Quill  <EricQ@cia.gov> . 
      We see that he s deleting unread emails:  From: Ted, Subject:

                                                                            BACK TO:

                          (shakes his head)
                    Some people.


      Veronica, clothed but with skirt pushed up, rides Eric on top 
      of her desk.  His seersucker pants sit around his ankles.  
      Various anti-American posters and murals fill the office.

                                  VERONICA

      She collapses on top him. He affectionately strokes her hair.

      He hangs up and moves to get off the desk.

                    I have to go.  Meeting.

      Eric watches as Veronica slips on her panty hose.

                    I think by any objective standard, 
                    this counts as mixed signals.

      He hugs her, she softens and nuzzles into his shoulder.

      Images splash across the conference room screen.  In the 
      back, Eric sneaks into the empty seat next to MIA.

      An image of EL PRESIDENTE (70s, robust) pops on the screen.

                    We all know El Presidente Garcia 
                    Montero, the venerated leader of 
                    Altamara.  A force of stability and

                    Sadly, he s decided to retire.

      President Montero lays on a massage table.  A tall Swedish 
      woman works on his back as an AIDE holds documents to sign. 
      The door opens.  Ted enters, followed by Larry carrying a 
      briefcase.  They walk up to the President.

      Larry opens the briefcase, revealing stacks of cash.  The 
      President takes a moment then gives an  okay  shrug and nod.

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:

                    With the field open, there are two 
                    main contenders for the presidency. 

      The image of BENNY GONZALEZ (50s, squat) comes up on screen.                                                                                    11.


                                  TED (CONT D)
                    The first:  Benny Gonzalez -- labor 
                    leader, author and famed anti-
                    American.  We respectfully tried to 
                    dissuade him from running.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Ted and Larry on a couch across from Benny.

                                  TED
                    Run for President and we kill you.

                                  BENNY
                          (laughs)
                    Go ahead and try.  It ll give me 
                    something to talk about at Castro s 
                    eighty third birthday.  

      Benny cheerfully treats himself to a danish on the table.  
      Larry shakes his head and mumbles under his breath.

                    Luckily, the other contender is 
                    Francisco Villalobos...

      An image pops of FRANCISCO VILLALOBOS (40s, smooth, 
      sophisticated) with TIM MCGRAW in front of an American flag.

      As Eric moves to get up Ted stops him with a withering look.

                    mission is clear: make Villalobos 
                    the next president of Altamara.  
                    He ll come around.  So be

      Mia and Eric walk down the hallway in mid-conversation.

      Eric turns and sees Ted leaning out his office.  Mia 
      continues on as Eric heads to Ted.  He passes Stan.

      Stan shrugs.  After a beat, Eric turns with realization.

                    Are you trying to psych me out

                    sue me for caring.


      Eric sits across the desk from Ted.  His office filled with 
      the detritus of forty years in the CIA.  Ted leans back in 
      his chair expansively.

                    Come on, Eric.  You know the whole 
                     means justify the ends -- 

                                  ERIC
                    I think the saying actually is  the 
                    ends justify the me -- 

                                  TED
                          (smiles)
                    Exactly.  We re saying the same 
                    thing.  The bottom line is:  what 
                    we do is justified.

      Ted settles back into seat.

                                  TED  (CONT'D)
                    I ve been in this game a long time.  
                    And I ve had guys come through here 
                    who ve gone to stations around the 
                    world -- Manila, Bratislava, Kabul -

                                  ERIC
                          (pause)
                    Kabul, really?  

                                  TED
                    Yes.  And everything you ve heard 
                    is true.  I can make that happen, 
                    if you re on my team.  So...

      Eric takes a breath and then...nods.  Ted smiles and opens a 
      safe hidden in his bookshelf.  He removes an envelope.                                                                                    16.

      Mia stands by the RECEPTIONIST (40s) reading out loud a flyer 
      taped to the wall titled  Station-wide Contest! 

                                  MIA

                    Wow.  Not bad.

      She then notices HANK (late 30s, good looking but intense) 
      sitting in the waiting area.  

                                  MIA (CONT D)
                    Who s the looker?

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    He s here for Eric...and he s 
                    insane.

      After a beat, Hank leans over to the receptionist                                                                                    17.


                                  HANK
                    Excuse me...excuse me again.  Could 
                    you lower those electronic blips 
                    and beeps I keep hearing.  They re 
                    very distracting.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    You mean...the office sounds?

      Hank smiles and nods.

                                  RECEPTIONIST (CONT D)
                    Uh...I ll do my best.

      She glances at Mia and then pretends to turn down volume 
      knobs on her desk.

                                  RECEPTIONIST (CONT D)
                    Is that better?

                                  HANK
                    Yeah.  Thanks.



      Mia steps up to Eric s cubicle. 

                                  MIA
                    There s a head case waiting for you 
                    in reception.

                                  ERIC
                    Oh my God, it s the contractor from 
                    Langley.  He s already here?
                          (beat)
                    What s he like?

      They both peak over the cubicle just as Antonio steps up 
      behind Hank with a box of Girl Scout cookies.

                                    ANTONIO
                    It s Girl Scout cookie time, are 
                    you interested in --

      Without turning around, Hank does a swift arm movement which 
      drops Antonio flat on his back.  Eric and Mia s eyes widen.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                            ACT TWO


      Eric and Mia walk down the hallway towards Hank waiting in 
      reception.

                                  ERIC
                    He wasn t supposed to be here until 
                    five.  I have that lunch with 
                    Veronica in an hour.

                                  MIA
                    So that s why you re all spruced 
                    up. 
                          (beat, re: Hank)
                    Good luck.  I m ready to notify 
                    your next of kin if necessary.

      She gives him a slap on the back and heads off as Eric walks 
      over to introduce himself to Hank.

                                  ERIC
                    You must be Hank Schneider.  I m 
                    Eric Quill.  Pleasure.

      Eric notices Antonio still out cold surrounded by cookie 
      boxes.

                                  HANK
                    Tell him when he wakes I took two 
                    boxes of thin mints -- the money s 
                    in his shirt pocket.

      Hank rises and motions to a newspaper on the waiting table.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    By the way, the sudoku is already 
                    done in that newspaper -- very 
                      disappointing.  

                                  ERIC
                    Sorry.  I did that.  

      Eric guides Hank into:


      As they sit, Hank shakes his head in disapproval.

                                  HANK
                    I guess you just drop the used 
                    paper there when you re done, like 
                    scraps for your guests to pick at.                                                                                    19.


                                  ERIC
                    I don t know about that, I just --

                                  HANK
                    You walk or commute to work?

                                  ERIC
                    I walk.

                                  HANK
                    So no train or car or bus ride?

                                  ERIC
                    No.

                                  HANK
                    Tell me honestly:  did you do that 
                    sudoku on the toilet, then put it 
                    out for everyone to touch?

                                  ERIC
                          (clearly lying)
                    No.

                                  HANK
                    That s disgusting.

      They sit in tense silence. After a beat, Eric sits up.

                                  ERIC
                    I ve gotta ask:  how the hell does 
                    someone end up doing what you do?

                                  HANK
                          (sighs in annoyance)
                    Murder s as old as the monkeys but 
                    I m treated like the bearded lady. 
                          (with mock fear)
                     Oohh.  His job s so cold and 
                    creepy.  What makes him tick?   
                    But, fine, I ll bite:  I was a go-
                    nowhere spook.  HQ asked me to kill 
                    someone.  I did.  My pulse didn t 
                    rise, so they said  Want a new 
                    job.   I said  What s it pay?   
                    They said  More than you make now.   
                    I said   Great. Sign me up. 
                          (beat, pointed)
                    How s that Mr. Profiler? Satisfied?

                                  ERIC
                          (beat)
                    Why don t we just move on to the 
                      procedural stuff and call it a day?                                                                                    20.


                                  HANK
                    I think that d be best.


      Eric hops in.

                                  ERIC
                          (on phone)
                    I know. I got held up in a meeting 
                    with a guy who happens to be 
                      certifiably insane.

      He settles in and adjusts mirror.  Suddenly, Hank s face pops 
      up in the mirror and terrifies Eric.

                                  ERIC (CONT D)
                    Holy crap!

                                  HANK
                    My hotel s on the way.  You mind?


      Veronica leads Hank into the living room as Eric follows.

                                  FRANCISCO (O.S.)
                    Is that my baby?

      FRANCISCO VILLALOBOS (50s, smooth, confident) emerges at the 
      top of the staircase and descends. 

                                  ERIC
                          (whispers)
                    Your father s Francisco Villalobos?

                                  VERONICA
                          (whispers back)
                    I use my mother s name.  It d kill 
                    me in revolutionary circles if they 
                    knew my father was rich.  I d be 
                    stuck picking up every check.

      Francisco steps up and hugs Veronica, then turns to Hank.

                                  FRANCISCO
                    Eric, I ve heard so much about you.  
                    You re finally making my little 
                    girl a proper woman.                                                                                    22.


      He embraces Hank.

                                  ERIC
                    Actually, I m Eric.

      Francisco turns to Eric, and squints with recognition.

                                  FRANCISCO
                    Do I know you from somewhere?

                                  VERONICA
                    Eric works at Oceana Import/Export.  
                    He probably ships your coffee.

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:


      Francisco and four sleazy looking guys sit across a table 
      from Ted, Larry, Antonio and Eric. 

                                  TED

                      shipment...if you smuggle in our 
                    rocket launchers.  Agreed?

      Francisco stands with a smile and shakes Ted s hand.

                                                                            BACK TO:


                                  FRANCISCO 
                    Of course, Oceana.  Right.

                                  ERIC

                                  VERONICA
                    And this is Hank Schneider.

                    You ve a lovely home...and family.

      He glances to Veronica, she blushes.  Eric tensely smiles.


      The four sit at a long dining table. 

                                  ERIC
                    We haven t really set a date yet?  
                    I think spring is always nice.  
                    Honey, what do you think?                                                                                    23.


      Veronica giggles at a private comment Hank made.

                                  VERONICA
                    Whenever.

                    her.

                    She s upstairs resting.

                    I m so lucky to have my mother 
                    living here.  The rock of my life.

                                  VERONICA
                    She s my inspiration.  

                                  HANK
                    My grandmother raised me.

      Veronica reaches out a comforting hand.

                                  ERIC
                    I love old people.  I ve given up 
                    many a seat...many a seat.

                                  HANK
                    If you ll pardon me, I have to use 
                    the restroom.  Where is --

                                  VERONICA
                    Oh, I ll show you.

      Veronica pops up and leads Hank out, before Eric can 
      interject.  The moment they re gone, Francisco jumps up and 
      gets in the chair directly across from Eric.

                                  FRANCISCO
                    So...how are things at Oceana 
                    Imports?  I believe your boss 
                      desperately wants me to do business 
                    with your company.  Perhaps so much 
                    that he would take advantage of my 
                      daughter s vulnerable nature.

                                  ERIC
                    No.  My feelings are genuine,
                      unfortunately.
                          (beat, optimistic)
                    However, there is this contest, and 
                    it would be great for my career if 
                    you would consider running for --                                                                                    24.


      Suddenly, the door opens and a small tank of a woman enters, 
      ISABELLA (80s).  Francisco s face drops, then regroups.

                                  FRANCISCO
                          (Spanish, pleasantly)
                    It s Mama!  I m with company, but --

                                  ISABELLA
                          (Spanish)
                    Tough shit.  My room s cold.

                                  FRANCISCO
                          (Spanish, sweetly)
                    Then we ll turn up the heat.
                          (yells)
                    Pablo!

        A frightened man-servant enters, PABLO.  

                                  FRANCISCO (CONT D)
                          (in English, furious)
                    You have one job: keep her away 
                    from me and you can t even do that.  

                                  PABLO
                    She frightens me.

                                  FRANCISCO
                    Fix her heat and keep her out!

                                  PABLO
                    The heat is up to a hundred.  Her 
                    parakeets have heat stroke.

                                  FRANCISCO
                    Then burn something, induce a 
                    fever, inject chili peppers into 
                    her veins.  But let her in here 
                    again and I ll shoot you.
                          (in Spanish, to Isabella)
                    All fixed.  I love you, Mommy.

      He leans in and kisses her.

                                  ISABELLA
                          (in Spanish)
                    You smell like onions and whores.

      She and Pablo exit.  Francisco collapses into the chair.

                                  FRANCISCO
                    I really wish you hadn t seen that.

      A deflated Francisco pours himself a brandy.                                                                                    25.


                                  FRANCISCO (CONT D)
                    To Latinos the love for one's 
                    mother is very special. 

                                  ERIC
                    I think that's true for most 
                      cultures...most mammals, in fact.

                                  FRANCISCO
                    Then I am not a mammal, because I 
                    hate her with every ounce of blood 
                    in my body.  She scares me...I m a 
                    coward.
                          (beat, desperate)
                    Please don t tell anyone...
                      especially Veronica.  She worships 
                    that old witch. God knows how.

                                  HANK (O.S.)
                      Veronica s taking a quick shower.  
                    She didn t hear anything.

      Eric turns with surprise to see that Hank stands next to him.  
      Something catches Eric s eye. 

                                  ERIC
                    Your shirts s on inside-out.

      Hank shrugs, then turns to Francisco

                                  HANK
                    You know...you could just rub the 
                    old lady out.

                                  FRANCISCO
                    What the hell is he talking about?

                                  HANK

                      psychopathic tendencies.

                                  HANK
                    Grandma s a problem...you get rid 
                    of the problem.  Simple.                                                                                     26.


                                  FRANCISCO
                    Are you honestly talking about 
                    killing my mother?!  

                                  ERIC
                    No!
                          (whispers to Hank)
                    What s wrong with you?

                                  FRANCISCO
                    If something happened to her, my 
                    life would be completely changed --

                    I d feel compelled to do something 
                    that honors her memory.  Maybe...
                    public service.  Elected office.   

      The room goes silent as the true meaning of Francisco s 
      comments sinks in.    

                                  ERIC
                    Are you saying if we get rid of --

                                  HANK
                    He s not saying anything.  He s...
                    musing.
                          (to Francisco)
                    Isn t that right?

      Francisco nods.  Hank takes Eric off to the side.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    You have to learn how these things 
                    are done.  But you have your 
                      Presidential candidate if you want 
                    him.

        Hank pulls Eric s cellphone out and hits Ted s number.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Call Ted, give him the good news.
                    Take the credit, make a name for 
                    yourself.  I m gonna end up with 
                    your girl, so it s the least I can 
                    do.

      He smiles and hands the phone to an unsure Eric.                                                                                    27.


                                  ERIC
                    Ted, it s Eric.  I have 
                      some...uh...great news.


      Eric drives stiffly, while Hank and Veronica are snuggled up 
      looking through the postcards in the back.

                                  VERONICA
                    Grandma gave me a set of postcards 
                    she made of her parakeets.  Isn t 
                    that sweet?  This one is her 
                      favorite...El Santo.  She loves him 
                    so much.

                                  HANK
                    She has a such a strong energy -- I 
                    could feel it the minute we met 
                    her.

                                  VERONICA
                    I know she can t live forever...but 
                    I hope when I have kids they get a 
                    chance to know her.

                                  HANK
                    They will.  I just know it.

                                  VERONICA
                          (smiles)
                    You make me feel so safe.

      Hank takes the card and leans forward to let Eric look. 

                                  HANK
                    Isn t Santo beautiful, Eric?
                          (in low voice)
                    I m thinking I ll induce either a 
                    heart attack...or seizure.  Any 
                      preference?

      Eric swallows with guilt and shakes his head.


        A disheveled Eric lays on a table while Mia tries to make a 
      decision in front of the vending machines.

                                  ERIC

      She hands him a bag of funyuns. 

                                  ERIC
                    So you don t think I should feel 
                    guilty about bumping off Veronica s 
                      grandmother?

      Isabella feeds her parakeets, then opens the doors to her 
      balcony.  Suddenly, she faces a MASKED MAN holding a syringe.  
      She SCREAMS and retreats as the masked man follows.  

      Inside Isabella s expression changes to cold, ruthless 
      confidence. She lets out a loud BIRD CALL.  Suddenly, a 
      frantic cloud of PARAKEETS descend and peck him.  He staggers 
      blindly back across the balcony toward the railing.

      Francisco enters the room.

                                  FRANCISCO
                    Oh my God,  Mama is...

      He sees Isabella turn from the balcony.

                                  FRANCISCO (CONT D)
                          (clearly disappointed)
                    Alive.

      Below the balcony, Hank lays dead.  


      Eric is on the phone.                                                                                    29.

      Intercut with Isabella, in her room, whispering in the phone.

      Eric hangs up and let s a sly smile.


      Eric sits across from a depressed Ted.

      convertible through a crowd in downtown Altamara City.

                    Oh God, no.   Setbacks are part of 
                    the job.  But you showed 
                      initiative, drive and ruthlessness.  
                    That can t be taught. 
                          (pause, smiles)
                    It s such a comfort knowing that if 
                    a dark, dirty, morally questionable 
                    job comes up -- I ve got my man.  I 
                    mean you were gonna kill a grandma.

                    That s outstanding.
                          (sighs contentedly)
                    Oh no.  I m not letting you go.

      We push in on a figure of a bald eagle attacking a bear.


      Stan sits wearing headphones, Ted s voice bleeds through.

                                  TED (O.S.)
                    Now get the hell out there and 
                    continue making me proud.

                                  STAN
                          (to himself)
                      Goddammit.

      Eric exits Ted s office and passes by Stan.

                                  STAN (CONT D)
                    Hey New Guy...we should grab lunch 
                    sometime.

                                  ERIC
                          (leery)
                    Okay.

      Stan gives a tight, awkward smile.  Eric continues into the 
      break room.  Stan clicks his computer, and suddenly hears 
      Eric s voice coming through the headphones.

                                  ERIC (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Shit.  No Funyuns.

      Stan smiles, then dials his phone.

                                  STAN
                    Hi, this Stan Latham at Oceana 
                      Import/Export.  Cancel our re-stock 
                    of Funyuns.


      Eric, in boxers, opens his curtains.  Something is taped to 
      the window.  It s the sudoku puzzle Eric left on Hank s 
      coffin.  However filled in the middle are not numbers but 
      words.  They spell out  NICE TRY ERIC. 

      Off Eric s disconcerted expression we...

                                                                          FADE OUT.
