CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT
A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the
police cruisers.
AGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN get out of the car.
They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.
They
are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones
in one ear, its cord coiling back into their shirt
collars.
AGENT SMITH
Lieutenant?
LIEUTENANT
Oh shit.
AGENT SMITH
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders --
LIEUTENANT
I'm just doing my job.
You gimme
that Juris-my dick-tion and you
can cran it up your ass.
AGENT SMITH
The orders were for your protection.
The Lieutenant laughs.
LIEUTENANT
I think we can handle one little
girl.
Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the
hotel.
LIEUTENANT
I sent two units.
They're
bringing her down now.
AGENT SMITH
No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.
CHASE HOTEL
Agent Brown enters the hotel, while Agent Smith heads for
the alley.
FIRE E5CAPE
In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at
her.
She can only go up.
ROOF
On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over
the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.
Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her
moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,
contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.
Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.
The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity
turns to it, racing for the back of the building.
The edge falls away into a wide back alley.
The next
building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is
perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other
roof.
The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something
ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself
into the air.
From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she
hangs in flight
Then hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.
COP
Motherfucker -- that's impossible!
They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the
move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto
one knee.
Just below the building are the runbling tracks of
riveted steel.
The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a
rattling blur of gray metal.
Trinity junps, landing
easily.
She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air
barely reaching the last car
Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.
Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.
Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point
where the train has begun to turn, there is --
A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick
building.
Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her
speed compounded by the train.
The SCREAM of the STEEL
rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the
turn.
Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body
leveling into a dive.
She falls, arms covering her head
as --
The whole world seems to spin on its axis --
And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then
falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down
stairs bleeding, broken --
But still alive.
Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,
still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the
wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train
slides him past the window.
Trinity tries to move.
Everything hurts.
TRINITY
Get up, Trinity.
You're fine.
Get up -- just get up!
She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.
STREET
Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the
end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she
sees it.
The telephone booth.
Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,
focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE
begins to RING.
Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its
TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.
Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the
telephone booth as if taking aim.
Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --
Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly
bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --
She answers the phone.
There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking
mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --
Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick
wall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp.
After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of
the garbage truck.
Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.
There is no body.
Trinity is gone.
His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.
AGENT JONES walks up behind him.
AGENT SMITH
Did you get anything from the
room?
AGENT JONES
Their next target.
The name is
Neo.
The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground,
separated in the crash like a severed limb.
AGENT SMITH
We'll need a search running.
AGENT JONES
It's already begun.
We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER
and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out
like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall
through one --
Swallowed by the darkness that becomes --
A computer screen.
We are on-line, inside a chat room called "The Matrix."
It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.
SCREEN
JACKON:
I heard Morpheus has been
on this board.
SUPERASTIC:
Morpheus doesn't even
exist and the Matrix is nothing
but an advertising gimmick 4 a new
game.
TIMAXE:
All I want to know is
Trinity really a girl?
LODIII:
87% of all women on line
are really men.
QUARK:
The Matrix is a euphemism
for the government.
SUPERASTIC:
No, The Matrix is the
system controlling our lives.
TIMAXE:
You mean MTV.
SUPERASTIC:
I mean Sega.
FOS4:
ALL HAIL SEGA!!!
We drift back from the electric conversation entering --
STREET
A police officer unlocks a yellow metal boot from the
wheel of an enormous oldsmobile.
SKYSCRAPER
The downtown office of CorTechs, a software development
company.
SKYSCRAPER
The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving
doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the
dark sedan.
Trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her
motorcycle.
TRINITY
Shit.
EL TRAIN
An EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails.
LOWER WACKER
A featureless black van glides up to a staircase that
curls down from the city's surface.
trinity guides the blind Neo down the steps.
The back of
the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who
looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is
a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.
His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity,
exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking
braces.
GIZMO
Va va va voom.
Still the hottest
software around.
TRINITY
Hello, Gizmo.
Neo hears the voices around him.
GIZMO
This is really the guy?
The guy
that Morpheus thinks --
TRINITY
Yeah.
GIZMO
But he's so old.
TRINITY
Are you going to help us or aren't
you?
GIZMO
Hacksaw.
Load up the copper-top
and let's get the hell outta here.
Hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron.
He
shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.
A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve
over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the
underworld.
ROOFTOP
Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo
launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek
--
But comes up drastically short.
His eyes widen as he plummets.
Stories fly by, the
ground rushing up at him, but as he hits --
The ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net.
He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on
his back.
He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from
his face.
Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet.
MORPHEUS
Everyone falls the first time.
Neo nods quietly.
MORPHEUS
If you never know failure, how can
you know success?
CHICAGO (MATRIX) - DAY
An El train.
HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright.
He is the only one without sunglasses.
MORPHEUS
Do you now understand what it
means when we say, if you're not
one of us, you're one of them?
NEO
The agents.
They're sentient
programs.
They can commandeer any
software hardwired to the
mainframe.
MORPHEUS
Anyone that is still in a power
plant.
That is why we try to be
invisible in the Matrix.
NEO
The best hacking is always
traceless.
Cypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the
perimeter.
As Cypher passes a garbage can, he
surreptitiously drops something inside.
It is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as
the LINE CONNECTS.
An early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a
corrugated roll-up garage.
Morpheus and Neo get in.
BAR (MATRIX) - DAY
The Continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of
neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes.
CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Storm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns
jaundice.
Cypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets.
He notices several unmarked white vans.
He mops the sweat from his forehead, when Trinity sees
the black Lincoln.
TRINITY
Here they come.
HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
Apoc opens the side door and they enter the hotel.
HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
More police cars arrive as cops break open the lobby
doors.
HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still
shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose.
As he is led past
Agent Smith, it almost seems that both men smile.
AGENT SMITH
We have them now.
STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Morpheus shoots out of the sewer but the police are
waiting for him.
The closest cop is armed with a
tranquilized gun.
He fires --
But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a
shield, blocking the darts, then --
Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him
off his feet.
The cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a
deadly weapon moving with impossible speed.
It seems he might fight his way out when he throws a
spinning back fist that is caught by --
Agent Smith.
AGENT SMITH
So, we meet at last.
MORPHEUS
And you are?
AGENT SMITH
Smith.
I am Agent Smith.
MORPHEUS
You all look the same to me.
AGENT SMITH
I've been waiting for this noment.
Faster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a
jaw-breaking right.
MORPHEUS
Oh, so have I.
Agent Smith smiles.
STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Smith and Morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows
that is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding
police.
Agent Smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers
Morpheus.
AGENT SMITH
You can't win.
Morpheus smiles.
MORPHEUS
I already have.
He stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his
eyes.
AGENT SMITH
Take him.
Cops swarm over Morpheus.
HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
Cuff ed and beaten, Morpheus is thrown into a caged
transport vehicle.
The DOOR CLANGS shut.
Agent Jones finds Agent Smith.
AGENT JONES
The others were lost.
AGENT SMITH
You've taken care of Reagan?
Agent Jones nods.
AGENT SMITH
Then the others do not matter.
STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
A manhole cover cracks open.
Two eyes peek out just as a
TRUCK RATTLES over it.
The THUNDER DOPPLERS AWAY and the
cover opens.
Neo, Trinity, Switch and Apoc climb out.
Trinity pulls a
water-logged phone from her pocket.
TRINITY
We need a phone.
STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Cypher is standing at a public phone.
Across the street
is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided
witli an oncoming car.
CYPHER
There was an accident.
A fucking
car accident.
All of a sudden.
Boom.
They're all dead.
I still
got the shakes but, Jesus,
someone's going to make a believer
out of me.
STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
TANK (V.O.)
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie.
An old appliance store.
Cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive.
CYPHER
An actor.
Definitely.
STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
They are outside a pawn shop.
Trinity has a new cellular.
TRINITY
We need an exit!
TANK (V.O.)
Gotcha.
You're not far from
Cypher.
TRINITY
Cypher, I thought --
TANK (V.O.)
So did we.
That boy's got nine
lives.
I sent him to Franklin and
Erie.
TRINITY
Got it.
She hangs up.
STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Running, Cypher turns onto Erie.
STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Trinity sees the appliance shop.
NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY
A Japanese luxury hotel in downtown Chicago.
A military helicopter sets down on the roof.
Heavily
armed Marines begin to deploy.
Agent Jones gets out of the helicopter, flanked by
columns of Marines.
They open the roof access door
and enter the top-floor maintenance level of the hotel.
NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY
A dark wind blows.
ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY
The roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo
and Trinity lay waste to a dozen more Marines.
Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used
with the same deadly precision as their feet and their
fists.
Across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter
watches the ferocious onslaught.
PILOT
I repeat, we are under attack!
Suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by
spreading locust-like swarm, of STATIC as --
Agent Jones emerges.
Just as she drops the last Marine, Trinity sees what's
coming.
Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is
behind him.
Screaming, he whirls, GUNS filling his hands with
thought-speed.
Fingers PUMPING, SHELLS ejecting, dancing up and away, we
look through the sights and gun smoke at --
The Agent blurred with motion --
Until the HAMMERS CLICK against empty metal.
NEO
Trinity!
Agent Jones charges.
NEO
... help.
His GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of --
Bullet-time.
The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead-like angry flies as Neo
twists, bends, ducks just between them.
Agent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS
coming faster until --
Neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a
spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.
He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across
his thigh.
He has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent
Jones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final
time.
CLICK.
Empty.
Neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house
kick snaps his jaw.
Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels
it at Neo.
AGENT JONES
Only human...
Suddenly Agent Jones stops.
Something is wrong.
He
scans the roof.
Trinity is gone.
Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the
muzzle of her .45 --
Jammed right into his head.
TRINITY
Dodge this, motherfucker!
BOOM!
BOOM!
BOOM!
The body flies back with a flash of
mercurial light and when it hits the ground --
It is the pilot.
Trinity helps Neo up.
NEO
Thanks.
TRINITY
You're hit --
NEO
I'm fine.
Neo is already looking at the helicopter.
NEO
Can you fly that thing?
TRINITY
Not yet.
She pulls out a cellular phone.
ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY
Trinity's eyes flutter as information surges into her
brain, all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed
at light-speed.
TRINITY
Let's go.
ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo pulls Trinity up into his arms.
Both shaking, they
hold each other again.
MORPHEUS
I knew it!
I goddamn knew it!
TRINITY
Morpheus!
She runs at him, throwing her arms around him.
MORPHEUS
Do you believe me now?
He's the
One!
Who else could have done
this?
NEO
Morpheus, I know you won't believe
me but the Oracle told ne I'm not
the One.
MORPHEUS
It doesn't matter if I don't
believe you --
His eyes light up.
MORPHEUS
What matters is that you don't
believe her.
ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY
The rope is all that remains.
Agent Smith can barely
control his anger.
AGENT BROWN
The trace was completed.
AGENT JONES
We have their position.
AGENT BROWN
The extermination unit is in
place.
AGENT JONES
Order the strike.
Agent Smith can't stand listening to them.
He moves to
the edge of the building, looking out at the surrounding
city.
AGENT SMITH
They're not out yet.
ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Smith stares, his face twisted with hate.
He will
never be free of the Matrix.
He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he
suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around,
staring --
CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
A man sits in his Mercedes, talking on his car phone when
his door is thrown open.
Neo yanks him out and jumps in.
Further down the street, Agent Smith slows, calmly
touching his ear-piece.
Neo throws the car across traffic, rocketing down a side-
street.
CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Three figures silhouette by the burning wreckage become
the three agents.
Further down the street, Neo hauls his broken, bleeding
ass.
Agents Brown and Smith slow, touching their ear-pieces as
Agent Jones continues chasing full-bore.
Neo spins around a corner, racing toward a hotel called:
the Heart of Chicago Hotel.
Only Agent Jones is behind him now.
Neo dives into the alley.
At the far end he sees Agent
Brown charging.
Neo leaps for the fire escape and begins
to climb.
ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY
The agents chase him, FIRING, BULLETS SPARKING and
RICOCHETING even as Neo jumps for the third-floor
platform.
Neo kicks in the window, jumping into the hall.
The
doors count backwards:
310...
309...
