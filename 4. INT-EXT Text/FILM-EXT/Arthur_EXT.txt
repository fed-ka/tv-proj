A HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top
broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in
Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district.
The street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches.
A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S
BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the
wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover.
BAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars.
We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches
and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'.
Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit.
The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New
York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's
steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of
the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze
testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away.
The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER
COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn.
A HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light.
ROOKIE COP
Cooool.
An older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a
FLASHLIGHT into a tiny window. THE BATMAN - actually drunken
English socialite ARTHUR BACH TEMPLEMEAD in a costume -
lowers the window and offers a handshake.
ARTHUR
Evening, Constable!
OLDER COP 1
(seen it all before)
Hi, Arthur.
ARTHUR
Are you familiar with the
expression `I can explain
everything'?
OLDER COP 1
Out of the car, please.
2.
ARTHUR
Terribly sorry, but in the film
they used a different model to show
the old Batchap getting in and out.
This one has no doors, so I'd have
to squeeze out the back arsehole
first. Which nobody wants...
(TO COP 2)
Apart from you, cheeky monkey!
(BEAT)
It's a joke! Okay, okay.
Arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. The bronze
bull teeters, a little scarily. He stands, wobbly. His Batman
utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip
flask and line of shot glasses. And, inexplicably, a big red
stapler. The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles.
OLDER COP 1
Okay, explain everything.
ARTHUR
Well. What with having spunked 1.6
million fat Alberts on this little
runaround, I thought why not take
it a step further and try to
actually collar a few ne-er do
wells? It worked for the
billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not
the future billionaire Arthur Bach-
Templemead? Will I have to do
traffic school?
OLDER COP 2
How much have you drunk, Arthur?
ARTHUR
To use the technical medical term -
megabloodyshitloads. Either that or
I've had a stroke! But fret not, I
have a designated driver.
The cop shines his flashlight back inside, revealing A
BEARDED HOMELESS OLD MAN IN A CRAPPY 60S `ROBIN' costume.
HOMELESS ROBIN
Where's my five thousand dollars?
Arthur counts out a huge wad of cash.
ARTHUR
The Boy Homeless here neglected to
say he'd never driven.
(MORE)
3.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Or that the only reason he's sober
is to be ready for the conspiracy
of leopards about to seize
Manhattan.
HOMELESS ROBIN
It's LIZARDS! English prick!
Arthur hands another wad of cash to Cop 1.
ARTHUR
I trust this will cover all repairs
to New York and any inconvenience
to your good selves?
He turns and tries to get back in.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the
other chap.
The bronze bull collapses fully, crushing the Batmobile.
Arthur steps into a blaze of paparazzi flashes.
ARTHUR
I am the Batman. Gotham can sleep
easy tonight.
JAY
(points at A CAMERAMAN)
Don't point that shit at me, bitch!
I will FUCK YOU UP!
Jay attacks the cameraman violently. Gary piles in.
HOMELESS ROBIN
Yes! Yes! Kill the lizards!
Arthur pushes past the press.
PRESS
Arthur! What will your mother say?
Didn't she send you here to get you
out of the British papers? Arthur!
6.
He turns to those crooks who aren't fighting.
ARTHUR
Anyone need a job? My last driver
resigned after I filled his limo
with squirrels. Preferably sober,
clean driving licence?
The crooks all look unsure. Apart from one....
TITLES
A different, extremely flashy car zips through Central Park,
the back full of released crooks, the huge Chicago guy - his
name's MARTY - at the wheel.
The car passes A MALE JOGGER. It stops and backs up. Arthur
opens a door and beckons the jogger, offering champagne. The
jogger gets in. The car sets off again.
ARTHUR (O.S.)
Anyone know a good bar?
The car pulls up outside a very rough-looking dive club. Out
falls Arthur, laughing his head off, along with champagne
bottles, footballs and rich boy's toys. Following him are
his crook friends, the jogger, TWO MIDDLE-AGED TOURISTS and A
DANCING MAN in a leotard twirling a big sign reading `CHEAP
APARTMENT RENTALS!'
Like the pied piper, Arthur leads his disciples into the bar.
JUMP CUT TO:
Arthur staggers out, leading a bigger crowd! (IN A CONGA?)
He's even more drunk, arm in arm with Carmella the prostitute
and a very attractive young woman, SOFIA. He produces A BIG
ROCKET.
ARTHUR
Stand back!
He releases the firework; it flies at a crazy drunk angle,
people screaming and diving for cover. It explodes into a
shop sign reading `CHECKS CASHED'.
7.
CARMELLA
(LAUGHING)
Oh, man. Nobody tell you about the
recession?
ARTHUR
The what?
A very long line of excited people stand at an ATM, Arthur at
the front.
ARTHUR
Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix
this thing right now.
(to his first customer)
How much, sir?
FIRST MAN
Um. $800 please.
ARTHUR
Coming right up.
(keys it in)
Fries with that?
The man laughs, along with others in the line, including
Sofia who catches his eye.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Congratulations everyone! THE
RECESSION'S OVER!
Arthur dials a number on his gold iPhone.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Pierre? Arthur Bach-Templemead. Can
you squeeze me in for a little
snack? Yeah, just me and a couple
of mates.
The bright dawn sun explodes on the windows of Arthur's
castle-like $56 million penthouse atop the Pierre Hotel.
Arthur stands naked in his shower - a big glass cube jutting
out from the balcony like something from a David Blaine
stunt. Hot jets of water are blasted from holes in the cube's
ceiling. Arthur can see Manhattan far beneath his bare feet
as he showers.
ARTHUR
(SINGING)
To Bombay, a travelling circus
came...
Arthur grabs a pair of binoculars which hang on a hook.
HOBSON
They brought an intelligent
elephant and Nellie was her
name...Hobson!
We see Hobson on a little screen inset into the glass wall.
She's on a phone at Arthur's computer.
ARTHUR
Female Tom Hanks!
Arthur and Hobson are in a huge Bentley. Marty's at the
wheel, still in his Cubs shirt but sporting a chauffeur's cap
and tie. As he drives, he checks a bleeping sports pager. He
nearly hits a pedestrian, then goes back to the pager.
MARTY
Sorry, fellas.
HOBSON
(CONSPIRATORIAL)
You don't seriously intend to keep
employing this gentleman?
17.
ARTHUR
Give the guy a chance, Hobson. He
got laid off in Chicago...
HOBSON
But he doesn't know his way around
New York!
ARTHUR
So? I want interesting, fun people
around me, not drones who just get
the job done...
Arthur sees something out of the window.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Marty! Stop the car!
Marty hits the brakes, pitching Arthur and Hobson forward.
Arthur hurries up to A SMALL GROUP OF TOURISTS.
WOMAN (O.S.)
The Chrysler Building. Designed by
William Van Allen...
A TOUR GUIDE wearing a name badge reading `Naomi' is talking.
She is gorgeous, wearing vintage clothes, clutching a
clipboard. We understand why Arthur stopped the car.
NAOMI
...and inspired by the machine age
of the 1920s, this magnificent
structure was the world's tallest
building for 11 months before the
Empire State stole its thunder.
She looks out on her sullen, miserable tourists.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
The Chrysler got its name when the
builder went bust in the 1928
Cement Famine and had to melt down
his Chrysler to make the pointy bit
at the top. If you peer closely you
can still make out remnants of a
hub cap and a sticker reading `Honk
twice if you voted Hoover.'
Some tourists laugh. Some don't. Arthur's transfixed.
18.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
That was a joke, folks. It was
built for the Chrysler corporation.
Naomi shares an eye roll with A NEWSSTAND GUY who's clearly
in love with her.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
The spire is a beauty, especially
on a winter's morning when the sun
hits it and it just seems to...
GRUMPY FEMALE TOURIST
(INTERRUPTING)
How tall is it?
NAOMI
1047 feet madam, not allowing for
pigeon shit. Okay, let's cross.
Naomi leads the tourists across the busy road. She has to go
back to grab a teenager in the headphones, who didn't hear.
Arthur hurries alongside Naomi.
ARTHUR
Can I join your tour please?
NAOMI
Sure. It's $15, plus $5 for the
free authentic street pretzel.
Sorry, my bosses make the prices.
Arthur produces his wallet full of high-end credit cards.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
Sorry. I can't take cards.
(BEAT)
Ah, owe me it. I start on that
corner every day on the hour...
Just as Naomi's reaching the other side, a cabbie, driving
very aggressively, nearly hits her.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
Hey, you big blind jerk! Doesn't
your braille windshield work?
CABBIE
(ANGRY)
!NO ME HINCHAN LAS PELOTAS!
19.
NAOMI
PEGUELO ENCIMA DE SU ASNO, USTED
PINCHAZO GRANDE SU MADRE ES UN PUTA
ENORMA Y SU PADRE NO TIENE NINGUIN
MARTILLO!
The cabbie's shocked - but laughs and blows Naomi a kiss. She
smiles back.
ARTHUR
Wow. What did you say?
NAOMI
Just generalised criticism of his
parents and genitals.
(to the tourists)
Everyone make it over alive?
Excellent. Next we enter Times
Square, world famous for New Year's
Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball
descends at eye-poppingly slow
speed for the inexplicable
entertainment of a million drunk
fools. Many people think the square
is actually a square, despite
blatant evidence otherwise.
(TO ARTHUR)
Sir? What shape is Times Square?
ARTHUR
A circle?
NAOMI
(LAUGHS)
See? Morons.
More tourists laugh this time. Some...
GRUMPY MALE TOURIST
When do we get the pretzel?
NAOMI
Soon, sir. Soon.
She checks her watch and leads the party inside a laundromat.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
Okay, next the very Laundromat once
used by George Gershwin, Donald
Trump...
20.
Hobson's out of the car looking for Arthur.
HOBSON
Where the blazes is that boy?
Arthur!
21.
They emerge into the street.
NAOMI
Ahead, the jewel in Manhattan's
crown, the Empire State Building.
This iconic symbol of American
corporate might was adapted during
World War 2 in case of attack from
enemy forces. At three minutes'
notice the entire structure can
retract into the ground like a
tortoise's head.
TOURIST
That's not possible. I should know,
I'm a civil engineer.
NAOMI
You're not being very civil to me.
Some tourists laugh.
ARTHUR
The building doesn't retract; the
ground rises up.
NAOMI
Exactly. The ground rises up! Thank
you, sir.
ARTHUR
They were going to install giant
legs so if a plane was flying at
the tower it could run away. But
where's it going to run?
NAOMI
Manhattan's in the way.
ARTHUR
It'd have to jump in the Hudson.
NAOMI
Victory to the Nazis. Is that what
you want?
The group approaches a pretzel stand.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
Okay, folks, your pretzel awaits.
The group lines up to get their pretzels.
22.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
Do I know you from somewhere?
ARTHUR
If you go on Perez Hilton or TMZ.
NAOMI
What are they?
ARTHUR
The gossip websites.
NAOMI
That the internet? Ah, my
computer's too old for all that.
ARTHUR
For the internet? Seriously?
NAOMI
Life's too short for all this
obsessive upgrading.
ARTHUR
You consider the internet an
upgrade? Wow.
NAOMI
So why do people gossip about you?
ARTHUR
Ah, that was a joke. I'm nobody.
Arthur feels a tap on his shoulder. Hobson.
HOBSON
You're late for your mother!
NAOMI
(TO ARTHUR)
Sorry, this pretzel stand is a
watering hole for the crazies.
(raises her voice to
HOBSON)
The soup kitchen's just up and to
the left, honey.
ARTHUR
Hobson, this is...
(reads her badge)
Naomi.
NAOMI
She's with you?
23.
HOBSON
Delighted to meet you, Naomi.
Normally one has to go to a bowling
alley to meet a woman of your
stature.
NAOMI
Ooh, Grandma's got jokes.
HOBSON
You aren't the first woman who
walks the streets this young man
has asked.
NAOMI
Who's this? Joan Rivers' older
bitterer sister?
ARTHUR
My nanny.
NAOMI
Obviously. Seriously, who is she?
ARTHUR
My nanny. Well, she started as
that, but these days she's more of
an all-round enforcer and
bodyguard.
Naomi looks at her watch and glances to the tourists, chewing
on their pretzels. She starts to walk away.
NAOMI
Sorry, I have to get out the cattle
prod and haul ass. Got another tour
starting in eight minutes.
ARTHUR
Can I call you?
Naomi starts to walk away.
NAOMI
I don't give my number to grown men
with nannies. But as you may not be
a grown man, it's 917 476 2030.
Manhattan swallows the lovely stranger.
24.
The original Delorean from `Back to the Future' putters up to
Burt Johnson's imposing, tacky mansion. The car stops and the
gull wing door swings up, revealing an extremely drunk
Arthur, clutching a bottle of champagne.
Arthur's Bentley pulls up at a quiet part of Battery Park.
46.
ARTHUR (O.S.)
Sorry we drove around so long.
Navigation isn't my driver's strong
point.
There's a huge ding in one side of the car.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Or road awareness.
Arthur guides Naomi in the dark. She stumbles.
NAOMI
Okay, I'm officially a little
worried.
She tries to pull her blindfold off.
47.
ARTHUR
(LAUGHING)
Don't worry!
Arthur removes her blindfold. She's stunned to find herself
on a huge blanket under a tree in a clearing lit by numerous
candles. Before them is spread the most amazing picnic of all
time. Flowers are everywhere. A log fire burns in a grate.
Soft music plays.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
You said you wanted a picnic.
He pours them glasses of 1928 Krug.
NAOMI
Arthur, I don't know what to say.
It's beautiful.
(LOOKING AROUND)
Who did all this?
ARTHUR
The picnic fairies. Who liaised
with the flower fairies, the candle
fairies, the log fire fairies, the
hidden sound system fairies...
He lifts a silver platter lid to reveal a vast pizza.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
...and the pizza fairies.
A crack of a twig from somewhere.
NAOMI
Did you take account of the heroin
fairies who hang here at night?
But there's nobody there. A cool breeze blows. Naomi shivers.
Arthur uses a remote to turn the log fire flames up.
ARTHUR
It's nice to keep it simple like
this. I'm sick of Michelin-star
restaurants. All that embarrassing
crap with the specials.
NAOMI
Are you kidding? Where I normally
eat, the special's the one that
comes with a free toy.
Arthur lifts a grill lid to turn over succulent steaks.
48.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
You're rich rich, aren't you?
ARTHUR
I get by.
NAOMI
`It doesn't remotely matter how
much or what you spend it on' rich?
Arthur shrugs and swigs champagne, pouring more.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
Craziest thing you ever bought?
ARTHUR
I once inadvertently financed a
terrorist cell who said they needed
100,000 to open a falafel stall.
She laughs. She stops laughing.
NAOMI
Oh my G-d, you're serious.
ARTHUR
What's the craziest thing you ever
told a tour party?
NAOMI
I once said the Manhattan we were
in was actually a movie set built
for `You've got Mail', but that
after the film wrapped, everyone
moved to the set because there was
less crime.
A sudden, very loud, very out-of-date ring tone. Naomi takes
out a huge ancient Motorola phone.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
Yes, dad? There's a small Tiffany
butter knife about two inches from
his hand but it might take him
eight months to dismember me with
it.
(PHONE BLEEPS)
Gotta go, battery. Love you too.
She ends the call.
49.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
Mom died last year. For eight
months dad ate nothing but Popeye's
Chicken n' Biscuits in front of
CSI. So I persuaded him to move in
with me. Where he eats Popeye's
Chicken n' Biscuits in front of
CSI.
ARTHUR
Sounds like you're very good to
him.
NAOMI
What are you gonna do? All those
years your folks tucked you in, did
their best to stop you from eating
crap in front of the TV. And then
one day, you're the one saying `No,
honey, it's bad for you! Go to
bed.' Weird, huh?
ARTHUR
(not relating at all)
Yeah. I hate that.
(looks at her phone)
Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you
find that?
NAOMI
AT&T; store in 1998.
ARTHUR
It's...You've had it twelve years?
NAOMI
It's a fine phone. Battery life of
eleven seconds, which cuts the crap
right out of conversations.
Something weird is happening. The world wobbles imperceptibly
as the background drops away. She hasn't noticed yet.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
I can't believe these mofos who
gotta keep up with the latest
bullshit. CDs come along, so out
with the vinyl. Vinyl's back in,
out with the CDs. I just kept the
vinyl. Way cheaper, and I get to be
incredibly hip once every 20
years....
A beat. She looks around. And down.
50.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
Cutting wide, we see that the picnic was taking place on a
grass covered platform with a tree planted in it - which is
being lifted off the ground by a crane!
ARTHUR
I couldn't decide between picnic in
the park and dinner with a view. So
it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it
ace?
The whole thing is rising higher and higher and higher.
NAOMI
No it is not ace, you crazy English
bastard! This is dangerous!
ARTHUR
Oh, sorry. Forgot. They said to put
these on.
He pulls back the blanket to reveal seat belts. He straps her
in.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
(LAUGHING)
Naomi, it's okay! It's very safe.
It's this company called `Aerial
Delights'. They specialise in
catering unusual events at a height
of 180 feet above the ground.
A gust of wind blows the structure, which swings. Naomi
screams.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
So what got you into the walking
tours?
NAOMI
You're seriously making date small
talk while this is going on?
ARTHUR
Be still. Breathe deep.
(strikes a Zen pose)
`When you can be calm in the midst
of activity, this is the true state
of nature': Huanchu Daoeren.
51.
NAOMI
`Lower this freak show to the
ground and get me a cab': Naomi
Snart.
ARTHUR
(handing her something)
Taste this truffle.
Naomi tastes it. It's clearly delicious. She gazes around as
the crane swings them out over the Hudson. The view of
Manhattan, of the river, of the Statue of Liberty, is mind
bogglingly gorgeous from up here.
Naomi bursts out laughing. She sips champagne.
NAOMI
What the hell. Gotta go sometime,
right? At least it won't be years
of pain like mom. Just a few
seconds of screaming and falling
with a truffle in my mouth.
ARTHUR
So anyway. The tours...
NAOMI
(CALMING HERSELF)
Okay, okay. Be deep. Breathe still.
The tours are a temporary nine year
fill-in until I'm drowned in a
tsunami of apologies from everyone
who failed to recognise my writing
genius first time round.
ARTHUR
What did you write?
NAOMI
A kids' book. I sent a chapter to a
childrens' publisher. Sunshine
Press'. The rejection letter was
the meanest thing I ever read.
ARTHUR
Kids can be so cruel...
NAOMI
(INTERRUPTING)
Arthur? We have a problem.
52.
ARTHUR
I told you, don't worry. These
crane people know what they're
doing!
NAOMI
Not that kind of problem.
Arthur feels a blade at his throat. He looks up to see A
JUNKIE, CLEARLY HIGH, standing over him.
JUNKIE
Phone. And the watch. Hurry.
Arthur hands him his phone and watch.
ARTHUR
Um. Out of interest, how did you
get up here?
JUNKIE
What you talkin' about, dog?
We see a sleeping bag and needles behind the tree!
NAOMI
Great. `Picnic in the sky' followed
by `Robbed in the sky'!
Arthur get the giggles as the junkie reaches into his pocket
for his wallet. Naomi gets involuntary giggles too.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
This isn't funny, you lunatic.
The junkie stuffs his face with food, swigs champagne from
the bottle, then walks away. Phew. Then...
ARTHUR AND NAOMI
NOOOO!
The junkie's walking towards the edge, oblivious! Arthur
jumps up, causing the platform to wobble scarily. He grabs
the junkie's arm. The junkie swipes, cutting Arthur's hand.
ARTHUR
OWWW! You don't understand! We're
180 feet up in the sky!
JUNKIE
(LAUGHS)
You on the same shit as me, yeah?
Good stuff, right?
53.
ARTHUR
No, we're not high! Well we are,
but only in the literal sense.
The junkie hurries away again. He's about to walk off the
edge. Arthur runs and grabs him. They end up in a messy
struggle, the platform rocking badly.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
(TO NAOMI)
Hit the panic button! It's next to
the truffle station!
Naomi's panicking, searching desperately. Arthur and the
junkie roll over the posh food, right to the edge!
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Hurry!
NAOMI
I can't find it. Over here?
ARTHUR
No! That's the bouquet of world
hams!
Naomi finds the truffle station and hits the panic button.
Down in a Crane Cab an alarm goes off. The driver starts to
lower the platform.
Naomi tries to help Arthur as he struggles with the junkie,
but she gets slashed on the ear. She screams.
As the platform lowers, it swings back over the river to the
land and tips them all into the river!
CUT TO:
Arthur is walking Naomi along the Hudson, this time in
daylight. He stops.
ARTHUR
Here we are.
NAOMI
We're not going to end up in the
Hudson again, are we?
ARTHUR
I can promise you won't get wet.
CUT TO:
The Hudson is bare of craft....until, suddenly, a bizarre
mini submarine shaped like a dolphin, dives out of the water
in an arc. Arthur and Naomi are laughing inside it - until
they almost collide with a Circle Tour boat full of tourists.
Arthur and Naomi are hand in hand, walking along the street.
He's a bit drunk, wobbly on his feet, a little morose.
NAOMI
Are you okay?
ARTHUR
Yeah, fine. Actually...
57.
But Naomi sees something on the other side of the road.
Arthur gets a a text from Hobson: `TELL her!'
NAOMI
Hey, Richey Rich. Want to go
somewhere really romantic?
It's a big tacky shop: JACK'S 99 CENT STORE.
The live version of Simon and Garfunkel's `The 59th Street
Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy') is playing on speakers. Arthur
and Naomi look out over the view, the park, dark and empty in
contrast to the cheering and clapping on the recording.
Naomi sips her wine. Arthur throws back a whisky.
ARTHUR
Your kids' book. What was it about?
NAOMI
`Vlad the Inhaler'. About an
asthmatic boy detective.
ARTHUR
Be serious.
NAOMI
Oh, it was dumb. `The Boy Whose
Heart Escaped'. It was about this
kid who wakes up to find his heart
has climbed out and is shinning
down the drainpipe to freedom.
ARTHUR
I love it.
63.
NAOMI
Rainbow Press said it was too
disturbing. But it wasn't literal -
there wasn't a kid lying there with
a gaping hole in his chest. It was
just this cute little heart
bouncing up and down shouting `You
can't catch me, mofo!'. I'm
paraphrasing.
ARTHUR
Did he catch the heart?
NAOMI
Never got that far.
Arthur wobbles a little more.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
You like the hooch, don't you?
ARTHUR
Only if I'm sad, happy or bored.
There's this bit in a book Hobson
used to read me as a kid that says
it all: `We must stop eating
cookies, Frog!' cried Toad, as he
ate another.'
NAOMI
Frog and Toad! I loved Frog and
Toad!
ARTHUR
(FROM MEMORY)
`Frog put the cookies in a box.
`There' he said. Now we will not
eat any more cookies.' `But we can
open the box.' Frog tied some
string around the box. `There' he
said, `Now we will not eat any more
cookies'. `But we can cut the
string and open the box'.
Naomi lays her head on Arthur's shoulder.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
So Frog took the box outside. He
shouted in a loud voice, `Hey
birds, here are cookies!' Birds
came from everywhere. They picked
up all the cookies in their beaks
and flew away. `
(MORE)
64.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Now we have no more cookies to eat'
`Excellent!' said Toad, `I am going
home now to bake a cake.'
(BEAT)
Classic addict.
They might be about to kiss. But Arthur holds back.
NAOMI
That was beautiful. It's like you
read it yesterday.
A HORSE clears a showjumping barrier. Grant applauds.
GRANT
Bravo, Vivienne! Well done!
Arthur's watching, sweating in the sunshine, while Marty and
Hobson wait in the Bentley.
ARTHUR
I'd be wary, Grant. She's planning
to ride you around the course next.
Her last boyfriend broke his ankle
jumping that ditch. Had to be
destroyed on the spot.
Vivienne canters her horse up to them.
VIVIENNE
Arthur. What's so urgent that you
had to come all the way out here?
ARTHUR
I'm in love. With a woman who isn't
exactly who you'd describe as
Susan. She's called Naomi.
VIVIENNE
Arthur, we've been through this!
ARTHUR
Won't you at least meet her?
VIVIENNE
What family is she from?
ARTHUR
The Snarts of Detroit.
66.
VIVIENNE
Never heard of them.
ARTHUR
No, because they're normal. She's a
walking tour guide, her dad's a
retired car worker.
VIVIENNE
Susan will generate quality sons,
not oil-soaked car monkeys.
ARTHUR
Unbelievable! Why don't you just
keep me here, pay a servant to wank
me into a bottle once a day...
VIVIENNE
Arthur...
ARTHUR
...then inject it all into a field
of heiresses and see who farts out
a thoroughbred first?
VIVIENNE
We need an heir!
ARTHUR
Fine! You can have one with Stevey
Steroids here! Surely even your
uterus has had a face lift by now.
Arthur storms away towards the car.
GRANT
(STEPPING IN)
That's enough, Arthur...
ARTHUR
None of your business, J Crew.
GRANT
You are so ungrateful to your
mother. She adores you!
VIVIENNE
Arthur. Come back here.
ARTHUR
You can shove your inheritance up
your horse's arse!
67.
Arthur jumps into the car and it pulls away. Vivienne sits
shocked on her horse. But then she throws it into a gallop
and catches up.
VIVIENNE
Suit yourself, Arthur. Follow your
heart. But do be aware I consider
what you've squandered so far an
advance on your inheritance. That's
about $17 million.
ARTHUR
Why would you do that? You'd never
get it back.
VIVIENNE
No. But you'd spend the rest of
your life in court. There's a
simple solution to all this. Marry
Susan. And cheat with the nobody
from Queens.
Naomi's pointing at the Chrysler Building for a particularly
grumpy bunch of tourists of all types and ages.
NAOMI
(YAWNS)
Designed by William Van Allen and
inspired by the machine age of the
1920s, the Chrysler...
RUDE MALE TOURIST
Hey. I got a question.
NAOMI
Please, interrupt. Hell, who wants
to come home with me and butt in
with questions while I'm watching
Letterman? `Yo. How tall is Dave?'
(BEAT)
Sorry, sir. Late night, no sleep,
long day. What's your question?
71.
The opening bars of a familiar song start up somewhere,
filling the street. Suddenly, some of the members of her tour
group start lip syncing to Phil Collins.
RUDE MALE TOURIST
How can I just let you walk away,
just let you leave without a trace?
FEMALE TOURIST
When I stand here taking every
breath with you, ooh...
MALE TOURIST 2
You're the only one who really knew
me at all.
A van with speakers on the top is parked nearby, pumping out
the music.
NAOMI
What is going on?
OLD FEMALE TOURIST
How can you just walk away from me,
when all I can do is watch you
leave?
TEENAGE BOY TOURIST
'cause we've shared the laughter
and the pain...
NEWSSTAND GUY
And even shared the tears.
A Yellow Cab goes by, the driver lip-syncing out the window.
NEWSSTAND GUY (CONT'D)
You're the only one who really knew
me at all.
The song hits a hard club mix. Arthur bursts from the back of
the van in a frog outfit! The `tourists' launch into a well-
rehearsed dance.
ARTHUR
(lip syncing too)
So take a look at me now, 'cause
there's just an empty space.
And there's nothing left here to
remind me, just the memory of your
face.
(MORE)
72.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Take a look at me now, `cause
there's just an empty space, And
you coming back to me is against
all odds and that's what I've got
to face...Just take a look at me
now.
The song builds to a dance crescendo.
A magical moment. The crowd watches. How can she say no?
NAOMI
Sorry to be a wet blanket, folks.
he's getting married. But I guess
he didn't choreograph that bit for
you.
ARTHUR
But..but this took ages to
rehearse. I had the frog outfit
specially made. These aren't actual
tourists.
NAOMI
I gathered that, Arthur. Are you
capable of doing anything without
it being a grand gesture?
ARTHUR
What do you mean?
NAOMI
It's like Hobson said. You're not
like other men. If you were normal,
if the money and the booze didn't
cloud everything, you'd deal with
the fact that you're engaged,
rather than just looking for ways
to win me back. But it was a lovely
routine, really. Fantastic outfit.
ARTHUR
I just wanted to see you.
He takes out his flask and has a swig.
NAOMI
(SYMPATHETIC)
You need to see someone, Arthur.
Seriously.
73.
The car drives through Manhattan.
Naomi's riding the bus. Her phone rings. `Number withheld'.
She rolls her eyes and answers.
NAOMI
Arthur, if that's...
(BEAT)
Hello? Yes. Yes, I did...Yes.
Sorry? Really? Well I worked pretty
hard on it..Love to...Love
to...What time?
Incredibly excited, she grabs a pen and writes on a walking
tours brochure: `JULIAN BARBER...RAINBOW PRESS...'
NAOMI (CONT'D)
I'll call in dead to work. Bye.
She writes `TUESDAY 11.30' and an address.
HORDES OF SMARTLY-DRESSED RICH PEOPLE are gathering on Burt
Johnson's mansion for the society night of the year. A high-
level security presence is much in evidence.
Naomi climbs out of a crappy cab. She's on her phone.
NAOMI
With all due respect, Hobson,
you're talking out of your frumpy
English ass. Arthur needs to know!
Naomi hurries past A DOOR MAN with a clipboard.
DOOR MAN
Excuse me, madam. Name? Madam?
83.
Naomi grabs the arm of A MALE GUEST.
NAOMI
Snart plus one.
She hurries in with the bemused, but delighted man. The DOOR
MAN checks his clipboard.
NAOMI
Are you sure he's this way?
JUSTIN
Absolutely.
Naomi turns to A WOMAN.
NAOMI
(to a WOMAN)
Excuse me. Have you seen Arthur?
WOMAN
That way. The ballroom.
NAOMI
Bye, Justin.
Naomi hurries away - running straight into the Door Man.
DOOR MAN
Excuse me, madam. You're not an
authorized guest.
86.
NAOMI
I know that. I'm here to give
Arthur some very important news.
DOOR MAN
Of course you are.
(takes her arm)
Shall we discuss this outside?
NAOMI
(SHOUTS)
Get your hands off me!
They tussle. Arthur intercedes.
ARTHUR
It's okay, Jeff. She can stay.
NAOMI
Arthur, can I talk to you?
We see a short montage of Arthur, now sober, taking care of
Hobson with Marty's help: Reading to her...Watching another
bear documentary...Arthur doing silly yoga for Hobson...
PASSERSBY are staring in horror at a yellow cab, its roof
caved in, the DRIVER shaking in shock.
Tilt up to find Hobson's HUGE teddy BEAR lying on the roof.
Arthur's on his phone again.
ARTHUR
(leaving a message)
Naomi? I doubt you'll ever get
this, because your voicemail
probably consists of a 4000 year
old woman who writes the message
down in hieroglyphics then loses it
down the back of her incontinence
loin cloth. Hobson died. Hobson
died and I've fallen apart...
The doorbell rings from off.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Marty! Can you get that? Marty!
(INTO PHONE)
Naomi? Could you get it? Hello?
He throws the cellphone off the roof. A couple of seconds
pass. We hear a very faint howl of pain from whoever it hit.
Burt and Vivienne are standing outside, greeting GUESTS.
100.
BURT
I just want you to know, if he
doesn't show up for this wedding, I
can't know what I'll do.
VIVIENNE
Don't worry, Burt. He's cleaned
himself up. He's stopped drinking,
he's anxious to get a real job.
He's become a responsible citizen.
Arthur is stalking - drunk but determined - through the
crowds. He comes upon a group of tourists standing by a tour
bus. Naomi's now wearing a headset mic, pointing south.
NAOMI
Due to a tragic error in the
architect's drawing, the original
Statue of Liberty unveiled in 1886
was just seven inches tall. 100,000
New Yorkers rioted, having come
expecting to see something more
impressive than a garden gnome
holding up an ice cream...
ARTHUR
Naomi!
Arthur pushes his way through the tourists. He sees her bus
and headset.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
You're on a bus? With a microphone?
NAOMI
Girl's gotta have a dream.
ARTHUR
Naomi. Can you take the next 60
years off?
NAOMI
Are you okay? You're a mess. You
look like you...now.
ARTHUR
Sorry. I accidentally swallowed
three bottles of hand sanitizer.
Fascinating story...Okay.
(MORE)
101.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Drinking was the only way I could
get the courage to come here and
say this: I don't need the money. I
love the money. But I don't lie
awake all night wondering how I'll
live without ever seeing it again.
I just wonder what it's like to go
24 hours without a steak tartare.
Naomi looks unconvinced. Arthur pulls out his wallet and
takes out a load of credit cards.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
The American Express Centurion card
- you have to spend at least
$250,000 a year to keep it, which I
blow in a quiet week.
He drops it down a drain. He produces another card.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Sotheby's `World Elite' Mastercard
for art collectors.
Drops it down drain too. The tourists are enjoying this.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
And King of all idiotic reckless-
SPEND-THE-FUCK-OUT-OF-EVERYTHING-
FOR-TOMORROW-WE-DIE PLASTIC
insanity: the Visa Black Card.
This last one he hands to a PASSING HOMELESS MAN.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
PIN 3487. Daily ATM limit $180,000.
The man runs into the road. As Arthur talks, out of focus we
see the man hit by a car, but get up and keep going.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
(producing fancy iPhone)
The world's only platinum iPhone.
With police radio app.
He tosses it over his shoulder. It lands in the beef juice
pan of a Street French Dip stall. A BIGGER CROWD is
gathering. Arthur takes off his jacket.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Alexander Amosu. Vicuna wool, shorn
once every three years from the
South American camelid - $50,000.
102.
He throws the jacket in a passing cab's window. He takes off
his pants.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Westmancott trousers, ten months to
design, fit and make. $21,000.
He hands the trousers to a PASSERBY. Off with his watch!
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
(SHOUTS)
Who wants the watch Neil Armstrong
wore to step on the sun!
Arthur flings it in the air. A crazed fight breaks out.
Arthur stands before Naomi in just his underpants and socks.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
These are from The Gap.
NAOMI
I'm so sorry about Hobson.
They step away from the tourists.
ARTHUR
I'm sorry about the Rainbow Press.
NAOMI
It's okay. So how did Susan take it
that you're not marrying her?
ARTHUR
She didn't.
NAOMI
You haven't told her?
ARTHUR
What's it to you? She's your arch-
enemy.
NAOMI
Are you six? She isn't my enemy.
She's the woman you proposed to!
ARTHUR
I couldn't tell her! Today's the
biggest day of her life!
NAOMI
The wedding's today? When?
103.
ARTHUR
12. Which is...
(looks at his wrist)
Where's my watch gone?
NAOMI
(looks at her watch)
It's eight minutes to.
ARTHUR
It's too late, then.
Naomi hands Arthur her phone.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I don't know her number! It's in my
phone's address book in that gloop.
NAOMI
Church?
ARTHUR
St. John the Divine. Can we please
just get me some clothes...
NAOMI
St John..Fourth largest church in
the world...111th and Amsterdam.
It's about four miles. Better
hurry.
ARTHUR
You want me to go there? Like this?
NAOMI
What's the alternative? Jilt Susan
at the altar? Can I expect the same
treatment when you dump me?
ARTHUR
No! I love you!
Naomi starts herding her tourists onto her bus.
NAOMI
C'mon, folks...
ARTHUR
Naomi! Susan's dad will...
104.
NAOMI
Arthur. Prove you're not the same
pampered little boy who can have
what he wants then toss it aside
when he's bored. Then we'll talk.
She sits in the driving seat and belts up.
ARTHUR
Naomi! I don't even know the way!
NAOMI
5th...right on Broadway...left at
Times...Right on 7th...back on
Broadway....right on Amsterdam. The
church is the big stone pointy
thing full of rich people.
The bus door shuts. Naomi drives away.
ARTHUR
SHIT! TAXI!
A taxi stops. Arthur feels for his pockets. Ah shit.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Um, can anyone spare...
(to the DRIVER)
How much to St. John the Divine
please?
DRIVER
About 15 bucks...
ARTHUR
(to the crowd)
Can anyone spare $15 please?
DRIVER
What about tip? You cheapskate?
ARTHUR
30?
The crowd just stare back. The taxi drives away.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Stop! STOP!
Arthur looks at a STREET CLOCK: 11:53.
Arthur starts running in his underwear.
105.
Arthur runs along Fifth.
Arthur runs up Broadway, passing a Watch and Clock store.
Every timepiece reads 11:54.
Arthur stops, out of breath. He sees A LINE OF STREET
ENTERTAINERS. That gives him an idea.
ARTHUR
(SHOUTS)
Gather round for the nearly naked
Yoga man - YOGI BARE! I give you...
Arthur strikes a sequence of silly poses and names.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
`Chicken forgetting birthday'...
TOURISTS throw money. Arthur grabs it up. He looks up at the
Times Square digital clock: 11:56.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
TAXI!
A taxi stops. Arthur throws the money to THE DRIVER.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
How far can I go with $1.95 and a
Japanese coin with a hole in it?
106.
DRIVER
A block and a half.
ARTHUR
GO!
Arthur jumps in. The cab screeches away.
The cab halts. Arthur jumps out and starts running again. He
sees A BUS with `COLUMBUS CIRCLE' in its window.
We cut to people cheering Arthur, hanging on the bus's front
bicycle rack. But the DRIVER sees him and hits the brakes.
Arthur's flung forwards but gets up and keeps running.
He sees a Subway Station.
ARTHUR
(TO PASSERBY)
Excuse me, are there trains down
there, like in films?
PASSERBY
Yes.
Arthur runs down the steps.
Arthur comes bounding out of another station. Clutching his
dollar, he sees a bus. He runs aboard, and up to the driver.
ARTHUR
Ah! I'm trying to get to...
Arthur feels eyes on him. The bus is full of SCHOOL CHILDREN!
It's a school bus! They all stare for a beat, then get out
cellphones to report the weirdo in their midst, who runs off
again and up Broadway, passing a store's line of shopping
carts. He starts emptying them of quarters.
MANAGER
Hey!
A police car rounds the corner.
POLICEMAN
(INTO MIC)
Uh, unit 6J, we have reports of an
indecent exposure on a school bus.
Arthur jumps in a shopping cart; as the truck passes, he
launches forward, grabbing the rear fender!
Arthur's cab pulls up outside the church, surrounded by
ONLOOKERS AND PAPARAZZI. Arthur leaps out and fights his way
through the crowd. People start to recognise the crazed,
sweating panting weirdo in underwear. Paparazzi and
pedestrians photograph and film him. He runs into the church.
Naomi's tour bus screeches up. She hurries out.
Arthur and Naomi step into the daylight, pushing past
paparazzi and press. Marty is waiting in the Batmobile, now
repaired.
115.
ARTHUR
Sorry, Marty. This isn't mine any
more. Fancy joining us for a bowl
of Special J?
Marty gets out. The three walk away up Amsterdam Avenue.
FADE OUT
CAPTION: ONE MONTH LATER
ARTHUR (O.S.)
OW!
Arthur steps out of a Bentley.
