                                        ACT ONE

      AS WE FADE IN:

      We HEAR, as though through headphones, a woman, upset:


                                  SHY GIRL(O.S.)
                    Cada dos horas. No es justio. 

      BLACK becomes DAWN. No constellations are visible; in this 
      city, we save the stars for the streets. We SWIRL DOWN...

                                  SHY GIRL (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Lil  Mousy was my future.

                                    SANCHEZ (O.S.)
                    Did you belong to him?

                                  SHY GIRL (O.S.)
                    I was goin to.

      Morning light absorbs the harsh glare of...  

      EXT. MAC ARTHUR PARK - DAWN (DAY ONE)

      ...FOUR CRIME SCENE LIGHTS; they deluge the southeast corner 

      of the park with light. BLACK-AND-WHITE PATROL CARS are 
      there, as is the S.I.D. VAN. We MOVE ALONG...

      Crime scene tape decoratively wrapping the park as a present 
      for the cops. Looky-loos lean in, watching...

                                                                      DIP TO BLACK

      EXT. MAC ARTHUR PARK - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

      The last body zipped into a BLACK BODY BAG before it s loaded 
      into the Coroner s Van.


                                  SHY GIRL (O.S.)

                    They were just here to kick it, you 
                    know?   

      COLOR DRAINS from the image of the Coroner s Van. We PUSH 
      INTO the black and white image until the screen is a 
      patchwork of BLACK AND WHITE PIXELS.

                                                                      DIP TO BLACK

      INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

      PULL BACK from the image, which is now ON SCREEN in the 
        surveillance van. We ve tapped into the park s security 
      cameras in order to see from our van. 

      FIND folded among the bulky equipment D.C. BRENDA JOHNSON. 
      DET. TAO and BUZZ, are also cramped inside the van. One side 
      of BRENDA S HEADPHONES are turned away from her ear -- this is 
      how we ve been hearing Sanchez, who is wearing a mic. 

                                                                      DIP TO BLACK

      EXT. MAC ARTHUR PARK - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

      The CEMENT PICNIC TABLE where three members of the East Side 
      Catorce were shot is littered with FIVE OR SIX BOTTLES OF 
      BEER. Some bottles are empty; some will never get finished. 

                                  SHY GIRL (O.S.) 
                    We had a 40, smoked some good mota 
                    before he left.

      NUMBER CARDS dot the beer bottles, LETTER CARDS show where 
      two Catorce members were shot. The third was hit running away 
      from the table. A LETTER CARD,  C,  in the BLOODY DIRT marks 
      where he died...  

                                    SANCHEZ (O.S.)
                    And what time was that, about?


                                                                      DIP TO BLACK

      EXT. MAC ARTHUR PARK - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

      A DEPT. OF SANITATION DUDE scoops the blood-soaked DIRT into 
      a RED BIOHAZARD BAG. DET. GABRIEL kneels down beside him for 
      an update. We continue MOVING ALONG...

                                  SHY GIRL (O.S.)
                    Six? Lil  Mousy got home from the 
                    Pen at like eleven en la manana. 

                                                                      DIP TO BLACK

      EXT. MAC ARTHUR PARK - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

      FIND DET. FLYNN studying the pattern of bullets when a young 
      (no more than sixteen) light-skinned gangbanger named GUERO,  
      walks briskly past him. Guero has a shaved head and a large 
       14  freshly tattooed on his neck. He TAKES US TO...

      ...DET. SANCHEZ speaking with SHY GIRL. She wears her hair in 
      pigtails even though she s too old for it. GUERO interrupts--

                                  GUERO
                          (to Shy Girl)
                    Callate, chocha! Vete a la casa. 

      She does as she was told and leaves, trying not to cry. Guero 
      starts to follow when Sanchez stops him. 

                                    SANCHEZ
                    You re new, ese. 

                                  GUERO
                          (makes hand sign for East 
                            Side Catorce)
                    I been puttin in work six months, 
                    vato.

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Got your stripes?

      Guero starts to walk away, dissing Sanchez.

                                  GUERO
                      Chavala...

                                    SANCHEZ
                    This park used to be mine.

      Guero stops.

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT D)
                    Sanchez.

                                  GUERO
                    I hearda you. Guero. 
                          (then)
                    Lil  Mousy was one of my brothers. 
                    Mi sangre. And I m going to kill 
                    the next Joker I see.


      And off Sanchez, we... 

                                                                      DIP TO BLACK

      INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

      We hear Guero s threats continue as Brenda squints at the 
      MONITOR.

                                  BRENDA
                    Detective Tao, can you read this?

      She runs her finger along the TATTOO covering Guero s forearm.

                                  TAO
                     Trust No Bitch. 

                                   BRENDA
                    At least he s not afraid to be up 
                    front with his feelings.

                                  GUERO (ON MONITOR)
                    We been fighting for this park for 
                    two years. It s ours. And now our 
                    blood s all over it. 

      Brenda presses a button on her mic, speaks to Sanchez,

                                  BRENDA
                    Sanchez, who were the dead ones 
                    dating? Did any of those women 
                    switch sides?

                                    SANCHEZ (ON MONITOR)
                    Your bitches, they down with you?

      We PUSH INTO the black and white monitor Brenda watches and 
      the image FLOODS with color...

      EXT. MAC ARTHUR PARK - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

      Guero shifts his weight from foot to foot.


                                  GUERO
                    We don t keep no hood rats.

      BEHIND HIM, PICK UP DET. PROVENZA who s just arrived, as he 
      joins Flynn. They walk to the picnic table where S.I.D. s are 
      removing the NUMBER CARDS. 

                                  FLYNN
                    Bullets didn t spray. Each  victim  
                    died from a single shot to the T-zone.


      He indicates the space between his eyes, a.k.a. the T-zone.

                                  PROVENZA
                    Don t learn to shoot like that on 
                    the streets. Too bad he only got 
                    three of them. 

                                  FLYNN
                    We should give the killer a medal 
                    for cleaning up the neighborhood.
                    Why is Priority Homicide here?

                                  PROVENZA 
                    I guess a triple homicide s our 
                    automatic invitation.

                                  FLYNN
                    These are not Priority murders.

                                  PROVENZA
                          (looking around)
                    Where is Scarlett O Hara?

                                  FLYNN
                    The only thing she was getting out 
                    of our homies here was different 
                    ways they d like to  do her.  She s 
                    in the van.

                                  PROVENZA
                    We should process all our scenes 
                    this way.

      INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - MORNING

      There s a shave-and-a-haircut KNOCK. Gabriel leans in the door.


                                    GABRIEL
                      Department of Sanitation s all 
                    done. Can we release the scene?

                                  BRENDA
                    Sounds good to me.

      Brenda unplugs her headphones, bringing SILENCE to the small 
      van. She stands, stretches. Watches ON THE MONITOR:

      A Uniform unwraps the CRIME SCENE TAPE. Most of the Looky-loos 
      have gone; a few Homeless Guys wait to reclaim their trees and 
      benches. Among these people, one stands out: an OLDER BLACK MAN 
      with an erect military posture. He carries a small SCOPE and 
      walks to where the bodies used to be. WE GO TO HIM... 

      EXT. MAC ARTHUR PARK - MORNING

      COLONEL D.B. WALTER paces the distance from the third body to 
      the picnic table. He turns to the south and takes his small 
      SCOPE -- we see now that it s a rifle scope -- and eyes the 
      roofs of the nearest buildings.


      POV: RIFLE SCOPE

      Through the cross-hairs, we see the roof of the building on 
      the right is obscured by trees. But there is a clear sight to 
      the roof of the Park Plaza Hotel.

      The cross-hairs follow DOWN the stories of the building 
      until, at street level, we observe a FIGURE coming toward us.

      RACK FOCUS and see that it s BRENDA.

      RESUME EXT. MAC ARTHUR PARK
 

      Brenda approaches the Colonel.

                                  BRENDA
                    Excuse me, sir. May I help you?

                                  WALTER
                    Depends who you are.

                                  BRENDA
                          (BADGING him)
                    Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. 

      Col. Walter shows her his GOV T ID.; looks Brenda in the eye. 
      He looks everyone straight in the eye. 

                                  WALTER
                    Colonel D. B. Walter, United States 
                    Marine Corps, retired.

      He says nothing more. So with more of an edge, she repeats...

                                  BRENDA
                    May I help you?

                                  WALTER
                    Did you have any witnesses?

                                  BRENDA
                    Why are you here, sir?

                                  WALTER
                    How many shots did they hear fired?


                                  BRENDA
                    I asked why you were here.

                                  WALTER
                    Three, right? And did the shootings 
                    happen around eight last night?

                                  BRENDA
                    Let s get one thing straight: this 
                    is not the place of your questions. 
                    This is the place of my questions.

                                  WALTER
                    Let s get one thing straight: I m 
                    not answering any of your questions 
                    unless you answer mine. 

                                  BRENDA
                    It is a crime to withhold material 
                      information about a homicide, 
                    Colonel Walter.

                                  WALTER
                    It s not a crime to withhold my 
                    opinion. 

                                  BRENDA
                    And what would that be?

                                  WALTER
                    In my opinion, the shooter was on 
                    the roof at the Park Plaza Hotel. 
                    You might not believe me because 
                    you won t find any casings there.

                          (then)
                    I ll ask your next question for 
                    you: How do I know that? Because in 
                    my opinion, we are not dealing with 
                    an ordinary shooter. We are dealing 
                    with a sniper. And snipers are 
                    trained to be invisible.
                          (then)
                    I believe I can help you find him.

                                  BRENDA
                    How could you do that?

                                  WALTER

                    You know his name?

                    But he s my son.

      Brenda takes this in. As do we.

                                  BRENDA
                    And you don t know his name?

                                  WALTER
                    I haven t seen or heard from my boy 
                    in over a year. I thought he was 
                    dead... until these killings 
                    started happening.

                                  BRENDA
                    There ve been more than this?

                                  WALTER
                    Yes. And, back to my opinion, he ll 
                    do it again. I think, if we help 
                    each other, we can stop him. Leave 
                    the killing to the gangs. But we d 
                    have to keep my opinion about a 
                    sniper from the media. Otherwise, 
                    we both lose control of this case.

                                  BRENDA 
                    I don t make deals with someone 
                    I ve just met at a crime scene.

                                  WALTER
                          (hands her his CARD)
                    Get to know me.

      He heads off in the direction of the PARK S FOUNTAIN, which 
      has just sprung to life. 

      Brenda watches him go, then turns her attention to the roof of 
      the PARK PLAZA HOTEL. 


      POV: BRENDA S BINOCULARS

      It is indeed a clean sight to the picnic table where the 
      three men were shot. We re...

      EXT. ROOF OF THE PARK PLAZA HOTEL - MORNING

      Brenda drops her BINOS, looks at the park unaided. Hear the 
      SOUNDS of the city coming to life. Gabriel is at her side. 

      She looks at the sight lines from the roofs of the other 
      buildings. Re: the building to the left,  

                                  BRENDA
                    Trees block the view of the park 
                    from over there...
                          (looks to the right)
                    And that roof offers no protection.

      Brenda then looks around this roof: it has a three-foot-lip 
      and a few antennas rise up from its gravel top.

                                    GABRIEL
                    Good eye, Chief.

      Brenda examines the roof. Sure enough: no trace of anyone having 
      been there. No cigarette butts. No indentations in the gravel.  


                                  BRENDA 
                    There has to be some trace of the 
                    shooter. If Mr. Nobody even was here. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Not even a Mr. Nobody leaves 
                    nothing behind. 

                                  BRENDA
                    I want every last pebble on this 
                    roof processed by S.I.D. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    You got it, ma am.
                          (then)
                    How did you know to come up here?

                                  BRENDA
                          (considers what to reveal)
                    Lucky guess. The only way up to this 
                    roof is through the building. Let s 
                    see if they have security tapes.

      Tao arrives weighted down with equipment -- the department s 
      OUTDATED LAPTOP and BULKY VIDEO CAMERA. He s winded from 
      climbing three stories. He joins Brenda at the roof s edge. 
      Reaching for the camera....

                                  TAO
                    This looks like a good place to 
                    shoot from.

                                  BRENDA
                    I don t think you re the first person 
                    to have that idea.

      Tao sets up his tripod probably not too far from where the 
      shooter set up his. Tao aims his lens at the park. 


      POV: TAO S CAMERA

      The cement of the picnic table is white as bones. 

      THE PARK BECOMES ANIMATED

      THREE GREY SILHOUETTES materialize: Lil  Mousy sitting atop 
      the table; Big Mousy to his left; Payaso to the right.

                                  TAO (V.O.)
                    The shooter waited until he had the 
                      protection of night. His first 
                    victim was probably Lil  Mousy -- 
                    the guy sitting on top of the 
                    table. He was the easiest target.  

      A SHOT is fired from the roof of the Park Plaza Hotel. A RED 
      LINE illustrates THE BULLET S trajectory. 

      The bullet hits the silhouette on the table in the head. The 
      silhouette falls back, arms splayed across the table. PULL 
      BACK and we re...

      INT. MURDER ROOM - DAY

      Tao s computer simulation fills the ROOM S SCREEN. He sits in 
      the back, with his LAPTOP. 


      IN THE SIMULATION

      Big Mousy, the silhouette to the left of the dead body, 
      reaches for a GUN at his waist as Payaso s silhouette stands. 

                                  TAO (V.O.)
                    From the way the bodies fell, you 
                    can see some time elapsed between 
                    shots. 

      Another red line darts from the roof, aimed at Big Mousy s 
      head. The red line -- the bullet -- PAUSES in mid air.

      IN THE ROOM

      Tao addresses the troops.

                                  TAO  
                    Not much time, but enough so that 
                    the other two victims had a moment 
                    to react. 

      Tao presses a button and...

      IN THE SIMULATION

      The bullet resumes its trajectory to Big Mousy s head. It hits; 
      he falls. Payaso s silhouette starts to run.

                                  TAO (V.O.) 
                    They had time to be afraid. 

      The last bullet comes from the roof. Hits Payaso in the back 
      of the head as he tries to run away. The silhouette collapses.

      IN THE ROOM

      Brenda steps in front of the projection of the computer 
      simulation. It covers her face, briefly, before Tao turns it 
      off and the florescent LIGHTS FLUTTER ON.


                                  BRENDA
                    Three match-grade precision bullets 
                    were found -- 168 grain, dove-
                    tailed hollow-point .308s. They 
                    left small entrance wounds and 
                      grapefruit-sized exit wounds. 
                          (looks to Sanchez)
                    Detective Sanchez, how many 
                      sharpshooters did you see in your 
                    years on the Gang Intelligence 
                    Team?

                                    SANCHEZ
                          (leaning against a wall)
                    None.

                                  BRENDA
                    What s the lay of the land?

      He walks over to a whiteboard that contains a CITY MAP and a 
      PHOTO DIAGRAM of the power structures ( the family tree ) 
      within each gang. 

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    The victims were not veteranos, but 
                    they weren t just jumped in, 
                    either. They were in the middle 
                      management of the East Side 
                    Catorce. This is a Latino gang that 
                    claims the blocks...
                          (shows on the map)
                    ...from east 14th street to 
                    Wilshire. MacArthur Park is where 
                    their territory overlaps with 
                    another gang called The Jokers. 

                          (then)
                    They re similar gangs. Both deal pot, 
                    rock, H. and recently, both branched 
                    out into firearms.  

                                  BRENDA
                    So they wouldn t have any trouble 
                    getting the gun?

                                    SANCHEZ
                    No one would. It s probably an H&S 
                    Precision Pro 2000.

                    Used by SWAT and available on the 
                    internet. But there s no one in The 
                    Jokers -- no one in either gang that 
                    shoots like this. No new members, no 
                    old members.

                                  FLYNN
                    So there s a sniper on the loose.

                                  BRENDA
                    That s one way to say it.
                          (to Gabriel)
                    Any luck with the surveillance tapes?

                                    GABRIEL
                    The Park Plaza Hotel had a cooking 
                      convention in the lobby. There were a 
                    lot of people there yesterday. A lot.

                                  BRENDA
                    Flynn, would you please check those 
                    tapes. See if any of the faces pop out 
                    at you. I think we may be looking for 
                    someone with military or police 
                    training who also has a record. Lt. 
                    Provenza can help you.
                          (as Provenza moans)
                    Sgt. Gabriel and Lt. Tao, it was 
                    probably picked up on the street, but 
                    check and see who s bought an H&S 
                    Precision Pro 2000 in the last year. 
                    That s internet and retail. 


      POPE enters. The room comes to a stop. Pope nods to Brenda. 

                                  POPE 
                    Press conference. I want Sanchez to

                    If you go on the air and tell Los 
                    Angeles to be on the look out for a 
                    sniper, it ll be D.C. all over 
                    again. People won t get out of 
                    their cars to get gas. 

                                  POPE
                          (she has a point)
                    The press already assumes this is a 
                    gang shooting. Does it help you to 
                    let them go on thinking that?

                                  BRENDA

                    Well, but the East Side Catorces 
                    are going to retaliate against the 
                    Jokers.

                                  POPE
                    You can t have it both ways,

                    Okay. Gang violence escalates. 

      Pope exits. Off Brenda s conflicted expression, we cut to:

      A PHOTO:

      Another East Side Catorce lies face up in the dirt, single 
      shot to his head, half his brains on the sidewalk.

                                  FRANNY (O.S.)
                    That s Shorty you have there. It

      INT. HOMICIDE ANALYSIS - DAY

      Brenda with FRANNY SEVILLE, our homicide analyst. Brenda s 
      reviewing TWO CASE FILES. One features that brainy PHOTO next 
      to that dead guy s MUG SHOT. He was called  Shorty.

      She shrugs. Brenda looks at both the CRIME SCENE PHOTO and the 
      MUG SHOT of the other victim.

                                  BRENDA

                    the bullets have such velocity that 
                    they either disintegrate on contact or 
                    go through the head and deep into 
                      whatever s behind the target.

      CAPT. TAYLOR stops by. Stands in the open doorway.

                                  TAYLOR
                          (indicating Franny)
                    Using my homicide analyst again, I 
                    see.

                                  BRENDA 
                    Captain Taylor, didn t you think 
                    these two gang killings--

                                  TAYLOR
                    Which two? Gang killings account 
                    for sixty percent of the homicides 
                    in this city.

                                  BRENDA
                    East Side Catorce. Happened last 
                    month. Two vics killed the same 
                    way: single bullet to the head...?


                                  TAYLOR
                    A Catorce gets shot? He usually did 
                    something worse than the guy who 
                    shot him.

                    And the shooter ll probably get 
                    taken care of by the Jokers. It s a 
                    two-fer. Garbage in, garbage out.

                                  BRENDA
                    Would you be saying this if the 
                    victims were black?

      The temperature in the room changes. Taylor grows calm, very 
      still -- that too-stillness of anger. 

                                  FRANNY
                    I can go.
                        BRENDATAYLOR
      No.Yes.


      Franny goes. Taylor is her boss.

                                  TAYLOR 
                    These boys kill cops. So when they 
                    turn up dead I don t think black, 
                    brown, yellow, or white. The only 
                    color I see is blue. The gangs 
                    didn t start because of the police. 
                    They won t end because of the 
                    police. We just contain them.

                                  BRENDA
                    So investigating these murders is a 
                    waste of time.

                                  TAYLOR
                    How you allocate your resources is 
                    up to you, Chief.

      Taylor exits. Brenda watches him go. Thinks for a moment. 
      Thinks about the one person who does care.


      INT. BRENDA S OFFICE - NIGHT  

      Outside her office, we see the Murder Room is empty, except 
      for the cleaning crew. 

      Brenda sits across from Col. Walter. He sits with perfect 
      posture and, like James Duff, radiates power. Col. Walter 
      taps his Marine Corps RING on the chair as they take a beat 
      to size each other up. 

                                  WALTER
                    I was glad to get your call.

                    I know the esteemed place women 
                    hold in the military. Pretty gutsy 
                    for you to come to a girl for help.

                                  WALTER
                    Well, you kept the press out of 
                    this. So you know what you re doing 
                    here. And your reputation cancels 
                    out your gender. Seven years in the 
                    CIA, four years in D.C., three and 
                    a half years Atlanta P.D. One 
                    marriage that... didn t end well. 
                    And your father was a Captain in 
                    the Army. So you know the drill.

                                  BRENDA
                    Well, I ve gotten to know you a 
                    little, too, Colonel.
                          (checking her NOTES)
                    Your most famous shot was from a 
                    moving boat on the Mekong Delta. 
                    Blew off the head of an enemy 
                    sniper from 900 yards. You had 72 
                    confirmed kills in Vietnam, 9 short 
                    of the record. 


                                  WALTER
                    You got my military file.

                                  BRENDA
                    It was a big help.

      She holds up a FILE that is completely redacted. Blacked out 
      page after blacked out page.

                    Did you get my son s files as well?

      Brenda reads from a LESS-REDACTED MILITARY FILE. Shows the 
      Colonel (and us) a PHOTO of D.B. Walter Jr.

                          (a beat)
                    The road to his advancement was 
                    closed.

                                  BRENDA
                    Could you be more vague?

                                  WALTER 
                    The important thing you need to 
                    know is that two months after he 
                    came home, a stray bullet killed 
                    his wife, Donna. She was a social 
                    worker. Shot by an East Side 
                    Catorce. Wonderful girl. Wonderful. 

                                  BRENDA
                    Is her case still open?

                                  WALTER
                    Yes. Still interested in my 
                    opinion?

                                  BRENDA
                    Very.

                                  WALTER
                    That s why my son s doing this. You 
                    people can t find the guy who 
                    killed her. And he won t stop now 
                    until every Catorce is dead.

                                  BRENDA 
                    Why didn t your son seek revenge 
                      immediately?

                                  WALTER
                    Thought the LAPD was going to do 
                    it s job. He waited. Nothing 
                    happened. Last Christmas he walked 
                    out of the house and never came 
                    home. Set off to fight this war.

                                  BRENDA 
                    Tell me how you can help me.

                                  WALTER

                    You ll never find my boy on your 
                    own. He s behind enemy lines now. 
                    Disguised within that community. 
                    But I can tell you how he thinks. 
                    Might even be able to figure out 
                    who he plans to kill next.

      Brenda walks the Colonel to the elevators. He carries a THIN 
      MANILA FOLDER with the gang lists inside.

                    me there -
                          (the Colonel takes a beat)
                    My wife died fourteen years ago. 
                    And you know what it s like. Moving 
                    from post to post. Base to base. 
                    Your family becomes everything. My 
                    boy is all I have left. And I m 
                    pretty sure - if I m there when you 
                    find him, we can take him alive. 

      The elevator arrives, doors open.

                    So. Partners then?

                    Partners.

      Walters enters the lift. Brenda watches as the doors close on 
      their uncertain future.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      INT. TAYLOR S OFFICE - DAY (DAY 2)

      Brenda stops by. She stands in the open doorway to Taylor s 
      office. She does not enter. Taylor doesn t look up. 

                                  TAYLOR
                    Well? I know you can talk.

                          (delighted)
                    Again?

      He takes his reading glasses off. Gives her his full 
      attention. She shows him Walter Jr. s military PHOTO.


                                  BRENDA 
                    Does this face look familiar?

      He waves her in. She approaches his desk. He takes the photo.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    His wife was shot in 2003, spring. 
                    She was a social worker checking on 
                    a foster kid when she was hit by a 
                    stray bullet. 

                                  TAYLOR 
                      I remember the case. What was the 
                    last name?

                                  BRENDA
                    Walter.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Don t think so...

      INT. ROBBERY HOMICIDE BULLPEN - DAY

      Taylor pulls down a thick BINDER, looking for...

                                  TAYLOR
                    It was Quinn. Donna Quinn. She kept 
                    her maiden name.

      We see a PHOTO of DONNA QUINN: smiling and wholesome and 
      forever twenty-two.

                    Looks like several East Side

                    Nada. 

                                  BRENDA
                    Her husband came to see you.

                          (surprised she knows)
                    As a matter of fact, yes. He wanted 
                    to know why we weren t doing more. 
                    We offered a reward, set up a tip 
                    line. Re-canvassed the neighborhood 
                    again. I told him I didn t know 
                    what else to do.

                                  BRENDA
                    How did he act? Was he angry, did

                                  TAYLOR
                    No. He was very calm. Very 
                      respectful. Just like his father.

                    speak only to me. Wanted to go 
                    straight to the top.

                                  BRENDA
                    And...? Did you look for his son?

                                  TAYLOR
                    I filed the missing persons report. 
                    But we never found the boy. Or even 
                    the car he d been driving. He was 
                      definitely licensed to carry a gun -
                    - many guns -- and... I... well, I 
                    assumed he killed himself.

      INT. TAYLOR S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      She follows him into his office. He goes round to his desk.

                                  TAYLOR
                    The suicide rate for returning vets 
                    is somewhere in the seventeen 
                    percent range. I looked at his 
                    father and thought,  Here s a guy 
                    who would rather believe his son is 
                    missing than think the boy took his 
                    own life.  Never underestimate the 
                    power of grief.

                                  BRENDA
                    But if we assume his son s alive, and 
                    is seeking revenge for his wife s 
                      murder....  Five Catorces are dead. I 
                    believe Walter Jr. would stop this 
                    killing spree if he knew that he d 
                    already shot her killer -- which I m 
                    sure you d prefer, Captain -- or that 
                    we d made an arrest... which would 
                    also make you look good. 


                                  TAYLOR

      EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF THE PANTRY - DAY

      Colonel Walter heads toward the restaurant, wearing a RED 
      SWEATSHIRT.

                    Told you he was stopping for lunch. 
                    Still fuzzy to me why we re on him.

      He walks with A PAL FROM THE GAS COMPANY, who wears BLUE GAS 
      CO. COVERALLS and A BLUE BASEBALL CAP. They pause before the 
      restaurant. The Gas company guy looks like he doesn t want to 
      come in. Colonel Walter holds up a hand. Two fingers. They 
      enter the restaurant famous for its French Dip sandwiches.

                                  FLYNN (O.S.)
                    I m not sure this is more fun than the

      street.

      INT. FLYNN S SURVEILLANCE CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      They ve got a blown-up DMV PHOTO of Colonel Walter. They re 
      also as rumpled as their suits.

                                  PROVENZA
                    I don t know about that. Did you

                    They cut through cans. And they 
                    have this deal where you buy one--

      Provenza s phone RINGS LOUDLY.  Somewhere Over the Rainbow  
      is his ring tone. He looks at the I.D. Sighs.

                                  PROVENZA (CONT D)
                    This woman is going to drive me

                    That s why we re sitting here.


      He presses the  OFF  button on his phone. Through the window on 
      the driver s side of the car, we see the Gas Company Man with 
      blue overalls and blue baseball cap exits the Pantry.

      see it s COLONEL WALTER, who s exchanged clothes with his 
      friend.

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Gabriel waits with JESUS GARCIA, a.k.a. PATO. He s a mean-
      looking Catorce veterano who is about twenty-seven -- ancient 
      in gang years. Pato can sense Gabriel s unease and rides him.

                                  PATO
                          (like a black gangster)

                    nigger? Cuz I can tell you da 
                    Original Gangster, yo.

      Tao passes by, hears that. Gabriel looks upset.

                                    GABRIEL 
                    I am not your brother.

                    Don t like Mexicans. I could tell. 
                    Watch your back, brother--

      Finally, Sanchez rounds the corner, intercepts.

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Jesus.

                    Where d you get this fool, man?

      Sanchez pulls Pato away from a fuming Gabriel.

                    No man. Spring, 2003, I was riding the

                    save their lives, not just yours.

                                  BRENDA
                    We can get you somewhere else to

                    of here in about an hour. If you re 
                    sick of the life, here s your out.

      Pato says nothing. His PHONE RINGS. 

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Think of your hija. Your abuelita. 
                    Isn t she in the hospital, man?

                                  PATO

                    Shit, no one knew the black bitch 
                    was even there--
                          (answering his phone)
                    Homie...

      His face falls. He stands.

                                    SANCHEZ
                    What s up?

                                  PATO
                    I gotta go. We re just talking, 
                    right? 

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Wait. Tell us--

                                  PATO
                    Am I under arrest? 

                                  BRENDA
                    No.

                                  PATO
                    It s too late. Later, Sanchez.

      He speeds out of the room, bypassing Pope, who makes his way in.

                    That must be the call Pato got.

      Brenda puts a hand up to her forehead.

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

      Pope steps out of the interview room with Brenda.

                                  BRENDA
                          (nauseous)
                    Will. I may have made a big mistake. 
                    I may have given a list of known 
                    Catorces to the killer. 

                                  POPE
                    You  may have?

                    Plus their addresses.

                            expression)
                    I may have led our suspect right to 
                    his next victim.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:

      To white. As we MOVE ALONG the whiteness, we see that it s a 
      white TARP thrown over a body. 

                                    OFFICER LURIE (O.S.)
                    Guy lived in this building. His 
                    street name was Vaquero -- Cowboy -- 
                    but I m waiting for an ID.

      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING ON BIXEL STREET - NIGHT

      But the tarp isn t long enough to conceal the THICK RIVER of 
      SLUDGY BLOOD that oozed from the dead homie s head. One or two 
      good chunks of SKULL and BRAIN MATTER wait to be picked up. 

                                    OFFICER LURIE (O.S.) 
                    He was killed by a single--

      We go from the brain matter to a pair of good shoes belonging 
      to BRENDA. She finishes OFFICER LURIE s sentence--


                                  BRENDA
                    Single shot to the head.

      Brenda looks around, at the black & white patrol cars, at the 
      apartment building in front of her, at the faces looking 
      down. She sees ACROSS the street:

      Another tall APARTMENT BUILDING. It offers a clear sight to the 
      dead body. She looks DOWN each story of the building until her 
      eyes land at street level, where she sees a man in blue Gas Co. 
      coveralls looking at the roof. It s COL. WALTER. He turns toward 
      the body. And that s when he and Brenda make eye contact.

                                    OFFICER LURIE
                    Somebody briefed you already?

      She ignores him, moving immediately to the edge of the crime 
      scene. The Colonel stands on the other side of the tape.

                                  BRENDA 
                    How d you get here so fast?

                                  WALTER
                    Police scanner.

      Brenda looks him up and down. She doesn t buy it.


                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    You don t have to believe me--

                                  BRENDA
                    I don t.

                                  WALTER
                    I haven t lied to you yet, why 
                    would I start now?

                                  BRENDA
                    Because you found your son. Or... 
                    because you did this.

                                  WALTER
                    You had me followed. You know I 
                    didn t.

                                  BRENDA
                    You deliberately evaded 
                      surveillance. You paid some guy 
                    from the Gas Company 200 bucks to 
                    swap clothes with you.

      In the distance, shouts in Spanish --  Viva Las Catorces...  

                                  WALTER
                    I didn t kill this--

                                  BRENDA
                    I m bringing you in for 
                      questioning.

      Then -- POP POP POP -- the sound of gunfire -- but not like 
      it is in the movies. Here, it sounds like firecrackers going 
      off. The Colonel MOVES to protect Brenda--

                                  WALTER
                    Get down!

      Two Uni s shout at each other then take off down the street. 
      Officer Lurie runs past them.


      Brenda, crouched, looks at The Colonel, who has covered her. 
      The crime scene tape has come undone but remains between them. 
      Brenda looks at Walter s arms around her, protecting her. 
      Slowly, he pulls back.

      INT. POPE S OFFICE - DAY

      Brenda in Pope s office. Pope holds up the smiling school 
      PORTRAITS of two Latinos, no more than nine years-old. 

                                  POPE 
                    This is the fallout from  trusting  
                    your suspect.

                    Four people killed last night, 
                    including these two young boys.

                                  BRENDA
                    I know. Believe me, I know.

                                  POPE
                    I heard Taylor s side of this, too.

                                  BRENDA
                    I m sure you did.

                                  POPE
                    Why weren t you seriously 
                      considering the possibility that 
                    the son was dead? That the Colonel 
                    was also the shooter?

                                  BRENDA
                    I don t know.

                                  POPE 
                    Well, I do. Every time you see 
                    someone in uniform, or someone who 
                    used to wear one, you go all weak 
                    in the knees. A guy puts a little 
                    American flag in his lapel and 
                    throws his shoulders back and 
                    suddenly you think it s your dad.


                                  BRENDA
                    All right, Will. I may have made a 
                    mistake. Okay? Please.
                          (a beat; re: the pictures)
                    What are you going to tell the 
                    press about these little boys?

                                  POPE 
                    That two kids died last night is a 
                    tragedy, yes. But what s going on 
                    between The Catorces and The Jokers 
                    is an ongoing war. Which gives you 
                    some time to break this guy in 
                    half. And that s what I expect you 
                    to do.

      INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

      Colonel Walter sits across from Brenda, straight as a board. 
      Brenda has a collection of FILES next to her on the table. 

                                  BRENDA
                    You don t have a police scanner in

                    So you either knew where the next 
                    crime was going to take place - in 
                    which case you are not sharing 
                      information with me, as you 
                    promised to do - or you re killing 
                    these Catorces yourself. In 
                      retaliation for the murder of your 
                      daughter-in-law and the suicide of 
                    your son.

                                  WALTER
                          (shrugging)
                    You think I did it, just hold me 
                    here until the next murder.

                          (angry)
                    I have no intention of waiting 
                    around for someone else to die. 
                    We re getting to the truth right 
                    now, Colonel. This instant. Would 
                    you like to know how?
                          (off Walter s blank stare)
                    Either you prove to me that you re 
                    not involved in these murders, or 
                    I m walking out of here and calling 
                    the FBI, the CIA and Homeland 
                    Security. And I m going to tell 
                    them I have a military-trained 
                    sniper in my interview room who s 
                    using the citizens of Los Angeles 
                    for target practice. 

                                  WALTER
                    How am I supposed to prove I m not -

                                  BRENDA
                    That s your problem. 
                          (a beat; nothing)
                    Okay.

      Brenda rises. Walks to the door.

                                  WALTER
                    Wait, wait, wait.
                          (standing)
                    Please.

      Brenda pauses.

      Walter reluctantly reaches beneath his coveralls and pulls 
      out PASSPORTS and other DOCUMENTS.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Two first class tickets from L.A.X. 
                    Our passports. Mine and his. Going 
                    to South Africa. Okay? Here. Here. 

      Walter throws the papers on the table. 

      Brenda picks them up and looks at them.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    I - I was trying to find him before 
                    you did. Get him out of the 
                    country. I admit it. Is that good 
                    enough for you?
                          (dignified pleading)
                    My boy s not a murderer. He s a 
                    soldier. And who is he killing? The 
                    enemies on our streets. 

      Brenda lays out the CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of the boys  bodies.

                                  BRENDA
                    Let me introduce you to Miguel and 
                    Luis. They were also killed last 
                    night. Why? Because they were 
                    standing next to a Joker whom the 
                    East Side Catorces decided to blow 
                    away in retaliation for your son s 
                    attacks. Look at them Colonel. Two 
                      nine-year-old boys. Are they our 
                    enemies, too? Or are they just 
                      collateral damage? Acceptable 
                    losses in your son s private war?
                          (off Walter s distress)
                    Will this stop him? Innocent lives 
                    lost while he goes about exacting 
                    his revenge. Probably not. 
                          (throwing more PICTURES on 
                          the table)
                    The road to your son s advancement 
                    was closed you said. Why? Because 
                    U.S. forces mistook celebratory 
                    gunfire at an Afghanistan marriage 
                    ceremony for a hostile attack. A 
                    group of American soldiers ended up 
                    shooting every member of the 
                    wedding party. Including women and 
                    children. Your son was there.


                                  WALTER
                    That - that was an accident.

                    We ll see if the press agrees with 
                    you.

                                  WALTER
                    I thought we - wait. I ve proven 
                    that I-

                                  BRENDA
                    What you ve proven, Colonel, is 
                    that we re not partners. That you 
                    don t have any intention of helping 
                    me catch your son. That you re 
                    trying to help him escape. And, 
                    frankly, sir? Though I may 
                      understand that? It s a very bad 
                    idea. Your son is unstable and 
                    heavily armed. You were at the 
                    crime scene of his last victim 
                    before I was. You knew. You knew 
                    who he was going to kill. Tell me 
                    how you knew or I call in the 
                    federal government. Not only that, 
                    I ll contact every broadcast 
                    network, every cable news channel 
                    and every newspaper in the country. 
                    I ll plaster your son s face across 
                      television screens and front pages 
                      everywhere on earth. We ll turn 
                    this into the biggest manhunt of 
                    the 21st century.

                    my boy out to be a monster.

                                  BRENDA
                    Don t let him kill again. Don t 
                    withhold information from me.

      Walter bows his head, boxed in. Defeated. Brenda forces 
      herself to continue.

                                  BRENDA (CONT'D)
                    Identify the next target. Give me 
                    the current alias of your son.


      Walter looks up at her, struggling to contain his feelings.

                                  WALTER
                    You re good at what you do.

      The Colonel straightens a bit.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    And we go on doing it, don t we?

                                  WALTER
                    Don t leave me here. Please.

                                  WALTER 
                    My boy is not a monster. Remember 
                    that, when you get to the end of 
                    this. He would never purposely take

      Col. Walter and Brenda sit beside Buzz, who scrolls through

      All kinds of people walk up and down the make-shift aisles of

      IN THE ELECTRONICS ROOM

      Col. Walter sees something. All of a sudden, he leans forward.

      ON THE MONITOR: INT. PARK PLAZA HOTEL SWAP MEET - DAY

      A black man in a DASHIKI walks toward the camera passing 
      through the buyers and purveyors of the cooking convention, 
      swinging a KNAPSACK, bumping into a Mailman. The Dashiki s 
      eyes are covered; it s hard to see his face.


                                  WALTER (O.S.)
                    Freeze it there.

      IN THE ELECTRONICS ROOM

                                  WALTER
                    Is it possible to see that 
                    enhanced?

                                  BUZZ
                    You got it.

      He presses a few buttons and...

      ON THE MONITOR

      The Dashiki Man s face is much bigger. We see him walk past 
      the Mailman again. 

      IN THE ELECTRONICS ROOM

      Brenda watches the Colonel s face. The Colonel leans in 
      close, studying the frame. And sighs.

                                  WALTER
                    That s not him. I can only assume 
                    my son learned the hotel so well 
                    that he was able to avoid the 
                    cameras. All right. The victims.

      The Colonel reaches for his WALLET. Inside, folded among the 
      bills, is a faded PHOTO clipped from the newspaper.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Some months after Donna died an 
                    article ran in The Times with this 
                    photo. Some rap star was introducing 
                    a new line of clothing, said his 
                      inspiration came from the streets. 


      We see the PHOTO: Ten East Side Catorces make gang signs, 
      show off their tats. 

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Look how fat and happy they are. It 
                      infuriated my son. Infuriated me.

      There are four Catorces left in the photo. One face we don t

      points to the face we don t know.

      The room s in motion. PHOTOS of Walter Jr. and Toker dominate 
      the Murder Board. 

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Hey everybody. I remind you that 
                    our sniper, Walter Jr., was trained 
                    by the best. But he s out to kill 
                    the Catorces, not us. We ll 
                    surround this Toker guy, and 
                      anticipate the shot. Toker lives at 
                    113 Lucas Avenue. Far as we know, 
                    he s alone. All attacks have 
                    happened under the cover of night, 
                    which gives us forty-five minutes. 
                          (then)
                    Taylor s been kind enough to head 
                    up this operation.

      As she hands the ball off to Taylor, no one can really believe...

                                  FLYNN
                          (to Provenza)
                    She s delegating?

                                  PROVENZA
                          (looks out window)
                    What do you know. Pigs can fly.

                                  TAYLOR
                    When we surround the house, wait for 
                    me to give the go signal. Flynn, I 
                    want you to be my high eye on the 
                    building across the street. And make 
                    sure you re wearing your vests. 
                          (then)
                    Let s move it!

      As they head out, Sanchez stops Taylor. Loud enough for 
      Brenda and Gabriel to hear, Sanchez says (about Gabriel)...

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Maybe it would be better if we left 
                    the O.G. here.

                                  TAYLOR
                    You underestimate him.


      Sanchez nods, follows Taylor out. Gabriel turns to Brenda,

                                    GABRIEL
                    Do you want me to stay back?

                    USC may be in South Central, but it 
                    didn t exactly prepare me to work

                    man.

                                  BRENDA
                    So was I. Get over it.

                          (heading the other way)
                    I ll meet you at the house.

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Brenda, on the move, glances into the electronics room. She 
      can see Col. Walter hasn t moved from watching the 
        surveillance tape. Brenda then enters...

      INT. ELECTRONICS ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      The Colonel looks up from the tape, still defeated.

      Brenda puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. Walter looks 
      up at her.

                                  BRENDA 
                    I promise you, sir, I will do 
                      everything in my power to bring 
                    your son in alive.  

      She stares at him for a moment, then turns and exits. 

      The Colonel sits for a moment. Then straightens. Stands. Goes 
      back to the controls on the media console and turns back on 
      the screen. Hits rewind and once more freezes the somewhat 
      blurry picture of the Dashaki Man walking through the lobby 
      of the Park Plaza hotel...

      ...and off the Colonel s reaction, we...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Brenda exits to find FRITZ waiting for her beside his Toyota 
      Avalon. He brightens when he sees her.

                                  FRITZ
                    Hey beautiful.

      She s all business. She kisses him so fast on the cheek her 
      lipstick doesn t have time to make an impression. She 
      beelines past him and dives into the back seat.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    I ll drive.

      INT. FRITZ S CAR - DAY

      Fritz puts the KEY in the ignition.

                                  FRITZ
                    What do you feel like? Drive-thru?

      He looks in his rearview mirror. Brenda hunches down on the 
      seat; not even her hair is visible to the outside.


                                  BRENDA
                    Oh, whatever -- sounds good. Hey, 
                    watch the doors and tell me if a 
                    tall black man is leaving. 

      Fritz looks.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    He s got perfect posture, he s 
                    6 2 ...

      FRITZ POV: 

      Sure enough, Col. Walter heads out of Parker Center.

      RESUME

                                  FRITZ
                    Is he coming to dinner with us?

                                  BRENDA
                    No. This is actually less about us 
                    going to dinner and more about a 
                    joint operation between the FBI and 
                    the LAPD.

                                  FRITZ
                    Okay. Should I ask what it s about 
                    or be pleasantly surprised?

                                  BRENDA
                    I think pleasantly surprised.

                                  FRITZ
                    Is this official?

                                  BRENDA
                    Well, of course it is. We re 
                    just... a little behind on our 
                    paperwork is all.

      Fritz, watching the Colonel, tells Brenda,


                                  FRITZ 
                    He s pulling out of the lot.

                                  BRENDA
                    Could you follow him, please. And 
                    be extra careful because he s good 
                    at detecting surveillance.

      Fritz starts the car and his Navigation System springs to 
      life. A disembodied WOMAN S VOICE welcomes him.

                                  NAV. SYSTEM (O.S.)
                    Hello, Mr. Howard. The time is 7:32

                                  BRENDA
                    Who is that?

                                  FRITZ
                    I call her Tara. I think it s the 
                    same woman who does voice mail. 
                    She s my navigation system.

                                  BRENDA
                    I have got to get one of those.

      Fritz looks in the rear view mirror to see Brenda.

                                  FRITZ
                          (gunning the accelerator)
                    I must really like you.

      INT. FRITZ S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      We HEAR but do not SEE Brenda. Fritz, eyes on the road,

                                  FRITZ
                    You know what I would ve done. I 
                    would ve put an auto-trak on his 
                    car or a GPS homing device on his 
                    wallet or-- 


                                  BRENDA (O.S.)
                    We don t have FBI money -- that s 
                    why I m crouching in the back of a 
                    Toyota! 
                          (then)
                    What s he doing? Do you think he 
                    knows he s being followed? 

      Fritz studies the traffic.

                                  BRENDA (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Don t look directly at him!

      Fritz turns in his seat to look at her.

                                  BRENDA (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Don t look at me, either!

                                  FRITZ
                    You know, when I imagined you in my 
                    back seat, this isn t what I had in 
                    mind.
                          (then)
                    He s slowing down... he s stopping. 

      EXT. 113 LUCAS AVE. - DAY

      Taylor and his men surround Toker s house.

      Taylor looks to Tao. Tao has his GUN drawn, as does everyone 
      except Taylor. Tao looks to Sanchez, gets a thumbs up. 
      Sanchez looks to Gabriel -- thumbs up. Gabriel, swallowed by 
      his BULLET-PROOF VEST, looks to Provenza -- gets a nod. 
      Provenza nods to Tao. Tao gives Taylor thumbs up. Taylor 
      looks... 

      ACROSS THE STREET

      Where Flynn is ATOP the apartment building. No sniper 
      visible, Flynn gives thumbs up. He s got Taylor covered.

      EXT. HOUSE ON WEST 4TH STREET - DAY   

      Out of the car, the Colonel scans the rooftops nearby. He 
      approaches the modest house. Knocks. 

      INT. FRITZ S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      Fritz reports back to Brenda.

                                  FRITZ
                    He s knocking on the door of a 
                    house.

      EXT. 113 LUCAS AVE. - DAY

      Taylor approaches the door. Knocks. A Young Man answers the door.

      INT. FRITZ S CAR - DAY

      A little girl answers the door. 

                                  FRITZ 
                    Now he s speaking to a little girl. 
                    And he s getting back in his car.


                                  BRENDA (O.S.)
                    Stay on him.

                                  FRITZ
                    Okay. But who the hell is he? I 
                    feel the need for a briefing.

      EXT. HOUSE ON WEST 4TH STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      The Colonel pulls away from the curb. Fritz starts his car 
      up, follows him.

      EXT. 113 LUCAS AVE. - DAY

      The mood is dramatically different. GUNS are relaxed. People 
      return to their cars. Flynn has made it down from the roof. 

                                  FLYNN
                    She set us up.

                                    GABRIEL
                    No, she didn t.

                                  PROVENZA
                    Then where is she?

                                  FLYNN
                    She was never planning to show.

                    She s an even bigger bitch than I 
                    thought she was.

      INT. FRITZ S CAR - DAY  

      Fritz, focusing on the road, grows very serious.

                                  FRITZ 
                    I don t know about this. Your 
                    colonel could have a rifle in his 
                    back seat or something. Uh-oh...

                                  BRENDA (O.S.)
                    What? What is it?


                                  FRITZ
                    I think - I think he s winking at 
                    me.

      We SEE her now when her PHONE starts RINGING. She struggles 
      to find it while staying crouched down.

                                  BRENDA 
                    Fritz! Come on.

      Gabriel stands on the lawn, clutching his PHONE.

                    It s Gabriel...Toker s in County. 
                    He was busted two days ago.
                          (we hear exasperation in 
                            Brenda s voice)
                    Didn t even cross my mind to check... 
                    no, his cousin told us. Word is

                    I knew it. He lied to me.

                    You want me to turn around?  Cause 
                    he stopped his car again -- I

                    I m driving parallel -- he stopped or 
                    parked his car on the last block.

                                  BRENDA

                    Then let me out!

      Fritz LOCKS the doors.

                                  FRITZ
                    Not unless you keep your phone on.

      She makes a big show of opening her phone. Punches three 
      buttons. His phone RINGS. He answers, delighted.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)

      Fritz barely slows the car to a stop when Brenda throws open

                    I ll park the car and meet you. 
                    Wait for me--

      Tell a charging bull to stop, it d be easier. Fritz s car 
      SPEEDS around the corner. Brenda, carrying her PHONE, runs to 
      the next block and sees...

      GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL  

      Looming, as hospitals do. She runs closer, passes the 
      Colonel s car. She looks at the buildings around the hospital.

      ACROSS THE STREET 

      From the hospital: a mail truck is parked between an office-
      supply building and a bank. It s a little late to be 
      delivering mail.

      As she s moving toward the truck, Brenda s mind races--


                                  BRENDA
                          (into phone)
                    He wasn t looking at the guy in the 
                    Dashiki. He was looking at the mail 
                    man.

                                  FRITZ (O.S.)
                    What mail man?

      She runs to the truck, lifts open the back door.

      INT. MAIL TRUCK - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

      It s empty. 

                          INSIDE
      Brenda climbs  the truck, moves toward the driver s 
      seat. She searches around and finds...

      A POSTAL WORKER S ID. It s Walter Jr. s face, but not his 
      name.

                                  BRENDA
                    I should have known. I should have 
                    known. What would a mailman be 
                    doing walking across the floor of a 
                    cooking convention?

      EXT. MAIL TRUCK - NIGHT

      Brenda climbs out of the truck and scans both buildings -- the 
      office supply building and the bank. The truck is equidistant 
      from each. Each offers a clear sight to the hospital. Which one 
      did Walter Jr. choose? Brenda looks between the two buildings.

                                  BRENDA
                          (on phone)
                    Damn it. I m going into the bank.

      Brenda races up the stairwell to the roof, PHONE in hand.

      No reception. Hands shaking, she drops the phone, then her 
      PURSE. Draws her GUN. She truly is alone.

      POV: RIFLE SCOPE

      Through the cross-hairs, we see: JESUS GARCIA. Smoking. 
      Pacing the hospital parking lot. It is a clean sight to him.

      REVEAL

      EXT. BANK ROOF - NIGHT

      WALTER JR. leans away from the RIFLE SCOPE to look at his 
      target with both eyes. He wears the same mail man uniform we 
      saw on tape.

      BRENDA

      Cracks the door, slicing the pie. She sees Walter Jr., trains

                    Police! Put your hands in the air!

      Without turning around to even see who it is, Walter Jr. 
      freezes for a moment, putting both hands in the air.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)

                    Step away from the gun. 

      He does.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Put your hands behind your head and 
                    kneel to the ground.

      As he does so, he starts to turn around.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Freeze! Don t move! Do not turn 
                    around. Do not turn! Stop!

      But he does. And as he moves, he slides one hand from behind 
      his head down his neck, down toward his back -- suddenly --

      A SHOT RINGS OUT

      Walter Jr. jerks to the left and drops to the ground. Dead. 
      One shot to the head.

      BRENDA

      has both hands on her gun, which is still aimed right at him. 
      But she didn t fire the shot. She glances to the right -- in 
      the direction where the shot came from -- then moves toward 
      Walter Jr. s body. Sees what he was reaching for--

      A SECOND GUN 

      that he had harnessed to his back. It lies on the roof, 
      inches from his lifeless hand. 

      She looks again to where the shot came from--

      THE OTHER ROOF.

      Colonel Walter must ve chosen to run up the office supply 
      building. From there, he had a perfect sight to this roof. He 
      could see his son was seconds away from killing Brenda.

      The Colonel shot his son.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Colonel Walter!

      But he is nowhere to be seen.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Colonel Walter, show yourself! 
                          (then)
                    I know you re here. Don t leave me!

      FRITZ

      pushes through the door to the roof, breathing heavily. He 
      takes in the sight: Brenda standing over the dead body, 
      calling out into the empty night.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Please... Colonel Walter! 

      And we SWIRL UP to the sky...

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Show yourself...

      The buildings of Los Angeles a centrifuge spinning round in 
      the starless sky.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
