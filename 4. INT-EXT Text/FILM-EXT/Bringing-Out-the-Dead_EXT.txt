An EMS "bus" careens around a corner, tires squealing, lights
flashing, siren whoop-whooping, swooping through Stygian
canyons of New York.
FRANK PIERCE, 28, drives. He wears dark cargo pants, black
boots, a white shirt with the paramedic badge, "EMS" gold
logo on one collar, "OLM" on the other. "Our Lady of Mercy
Paramedic" is inscribed in white across the back of his
navy jacket. On his belt: two-way radio, leather gloves,
beeper, drug kit, multi-purpose tool kit, mini-flashlight,
collapsible baton.
LARRY, 35, overweight, his partner for the night, rides techie
(shotgun), both hands clutching the dash.
Frank scans the blurring cityscape for hidden danger. He is
a young man of slight frame and open face--his life, his
possible futures, still before him: behind those open eyes,
beneath those dark shadows: hollowness beckons.
Dispatcher's voice crackles through the cab static: "Ladder
4, respond to a 10-22, four flight residential, 417 East 32.
13 Boy, men's room Grand Central, man set his pants on fire.
Bad burns. 17 David, at 177 East 24, there's a
woman who says a roach crawled in her ear. Can't get it out,
says she's going into cardiac arrest ..."
Frank's detached voice speaks over the urban landscape:
FRANK (V.O.)
Thursday started out with a bang: a
gunshot to the chest on a drug deal
gone bad. Heat, humidity, moonlight--
all the elements in place for a long
weekend. I was good at my job: there
were periods when my hands moved
with a speed and skill beyond me and
my mind worked with a cool authority
I had never known. But in the last
year I had started to lose that
control. Things had turned bad. I
hadn't saved anyone for months. I
just needed a few slow nights, a
week without tragedy followed by a
couple of days off.
The radio continues: "Zebra, 13Z, 524 East 17--"
LARRY
(on radio)
We're there.
The ambulance breaks to a halt in front of a row of vintage
walk-ups. Frank and Larry jump out: Frank lugs the EKG monitor
and airway bag, Larry the drug box, yellow oxygen
pack slung over his shoulder. Neighbors crowd around.
OLD WOMAN
Which apartment? Which apartment?
FRANK
Move back. Where's the stairs? 5A.
OLD WOMAN
Oh Jesus, it's Mr. Burke.
The front door opens, a young boy holding it.
Author's note: in emergency situations, either on the street
or in the hospital, it is assumed there is continual
background noise--voices, sirens, cries, questions, etc.
CUT TO:
The EMS bus cruises up Second. Frank checks the side mirror:
John, Mary and Mrs. Burke pull behind in a black Ford. Seeing
their faces, Frank flips the lights and siren on. It's too
late to help Mr. Burke, but it's important to the family
that it look urgent. Frank watches passing lights, cars,
faces:
FRANK (V.O.)
I needed to concentrate because my
mind tended to wander on these short
trips. It was the neighborhood I
grew up in and where I had worked
most as a paramedic, and it held
more ghosts per square foot than any
other.
CUT TO:
Larry and Frank's 13 Zebra ambulance lined up beside two
others outside a blazing "Emergency" sign on the crowded
side street.
CUT TO:
Checking behind then, Frank stops. Mary pauses before she
speaks:
MARY
Is there any chance?
FRANK
(shakes head)
I guess there's always a chance.
The doors break open. Noel comes flying out, bounces on the
sidewalk. Griss, in the doorway, closes the doors.
Mary goes over to Noel:
MARY
Noel, Noel, it's me, Mary. From 17th
Street.
NOEL
Mary, Mary, Mary. I'm so thirsty.
They won't give me anything to drink.
Please, Mary.
MARY
(heading inside)
I'll get you some.
Frank watches: Mary returns with a cup of water, gives it to
a grateful Noel.
FRANK
I wouldn't do that.
(Noel drinks)
The doctor seems to think he's
suffering from some rare disorder.
MARY
It's not so rare. He grew up on our
street. He's had a rough life and
he's a little crazy from it, but
that's no excuse for not giving
someone a lousy cup of water.
Mary starts to cry. Frank fumbles in his pocket, finds a
tissue, gives it to her.
MARY (CONT'D)
My father's dying, Noel.
NOEL
Oh Mary, Mary, Mary.
Noel hugs her clumsily, his shoulders bobbing. Frank watches,
realizing this is what he should have done for her.
CUT TO:
13 Zebra cruising down Avenue C, Frank at the wheel, Larry
shotgun.
LARRY
The Chinese close in five minutes.
Beef lo mein. It's
been on my
mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
FRANK
I think the moment that food hits
your mouth we'll get a job.
LARRY
Turn here. You missed it. The Chink
is on 3rd.
Franks turns, gets jammed up behind a pimp car at Second and
Avenue B, a corner populated by pushers and hookers. TWO
WHORES stand in front of an abandoned building. Frank turns
to look.
WHORE #1
Hey ambulance man. What you looking
at?
The second whore, wearing a yellow vinyl coat, turns. She
has a face that instantly freezes Frank: the Rose face.
Pregnant, she gestures to her belly:
WHORE #2
Pretty soon you'll be coming for me.
LARRY
Some partner you are Frank. I coulda
walked there faster. I'm starving
and you stop to talk to hookers.
You're making me nuts. Is that what
you're trying to do, drag me down
with you to nutsville?
Frank hits the whoop-whoop siren. The pimps in the black BMW
jump, look back, realize its only an ambulance, and pull
away.
LARRY (CONT'D)
(slams dashboard)
Oh no!--I just remembered.
FRANK
What?
LARRY
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein
last night. I can't eat the same
thing two nights in a row. It's almost
two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna
do? What you getting?
FRANK
I'm not hungry.
LARRY
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
FRANK
I eat. I just haven't had coffee
yet.
LARRY
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't
dead with that diet. Wait, I've got
it. Half fried chicken with fries.
Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
Frank speeds up Avenue B. Noel, wearing generic homeless
combat fatigues, muttering to his friends in Hell, passes on
the sidewalk. Frank notices another hooker, catches her face:
the same face as the pregnant Whore #2. The Rose face. His
mind drifts:
FRANK (V.O.)
Rose was getting closer. Ever since
the call a month before, when I'd
lost her, she seemed like all the
girls in the neighborhood. One of
the first things you learn is to
avoid bad memories. I used to be an
expert, but lately I'd found some
holes. Anything could trigger it.
The last month belonged to Rose, but
there were a hundred more ready to
come out.
CUT TO:
The EMS vehicle is stopped at a fast food joint. Larry orders,
waits.
FRANK (V.O.)
These spirits were part of the job.
It was impossible to pass a building
that didn't bold the spirit of
something: the eyes of a corpse, the
screams of a loved one. All bodies
leave their mark. You cannot be near
the new dead without feeling it.
Larry gets his chicken, chats with counter clerk, returns.
FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I could handle that. What haunted me
now was more savage: spirits born
half-finished, homicides, suicides,
overdoses, innocent or not, accusing
me of being there, witnessing a
humiliation which they could never
forgive.
Larry climbs in, sets his take-out on the dash, hands Frank
a coffee. A police walkie-talkie is in the front tray.
LARRY
Turn it off.
FRANK
What?
LARRY
You know what. The radio.
POLICE DISPATCH
Ladder Four, respond to a 10-22 four
flight residential, 317 East 32nd.
LARRY
Let's do it. It might be a good one.
FRANK
You wanted it turned off. There's no
such thing as a good fire. People
get burned up. They can't breathe.
LARRY
That's what we're here for. Come on,
Frank.
FRANK
Don't push it, Larry.
LARRY
You're burned out.
RADIO DISPATCHER
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need
you.
LARRY
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
RADIO DISPATCHER
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an
unconscious at First and St. Marks.
LARRY
(screams)
No! It's three o'clock. That can
only mean one thing.
FRANK
Mr. Oh.
LARRY
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
RADIO DISPATCHER
Answer the radio Zebra. You know
it's that time.
LARRY
Four times this week I've had him.
Aren't there any other units out
there?
Don't answer the radio.
They'll give it to someone else.
RADIO DISPATCHER
Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra.
You're going out of service in two
seconds.
Pause. Neither moves.
LARRY
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer
it, that means answer it.
(picks up the mike)
You can do that for me at least.
(keys mike)
Three Zebra.
RADIO DISPATCHER
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the
man who needs no introduction, chronic
caller of the year three straight
and shooting for number four. The
duke of drunk, the king of stink,
our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
LARRY
Ten-four.
(Frank starts the
engine)
Don't go. Not this time.
FRANK
(driving off)
Relax, it's a street job, easy except
for the smell. We'll just throw him
in back and zip over to Mercy--no
blood, no dying, that's how I look
at it. He's just a drunk.
LARRY
It's not our job to taxi drunks
around.
FRANK
They'll just keep calling.
LARRY
Someone's gonna die someday causa
that bum, going to have a cardiac
and the only medics will be taking
care of Mr. Oh.
CUT TO:
Frank and Larry standing over Mr. Oh, 40, surrounded by street
people. Oh lays curled up beside his wheelchair, wearing a
black garbage bag with holes cut out for his arms, his pants
around his knees.
MALE STREET PERSON #1
He's bad mister. He ain't eaten nuthin
all day, he's seizing and throwing
up.
LARRY
(hand over nose)
So what's different?
MALE STREET PERSON #1
He says his feet hurt.
FRANK
Well why didn't you say so?
LARRY
He's drunk.
MALE STREET PERSON #2
He's sick. You gotta help him.
LARRY
He's fine. He can walk to the
hospital.
FEMALE STREET PERSON
Walk? You crazy? He's in a wheelchair.
LARRY
Don't start that. I've seen him walk.
He walks better than me.
Frank crouches over Oh, tries to pull Oh's pants over his
white, dirt-stained ass. Oh moans:
MR. OH
Oh, oh, oh.
LARRY
That's him, Mr. Oh.
(pulls at his arm)
Get up.
Larry and Frank get Oh to his feet only to have him stumble
over his lowered trousers. This time Frank lifts him, sets
his white ass cheeks into the wheelchair. They push him toward
the ambulance.
CROWD
Good luck! Get better!
CUT TO:
13 Zebra heads up First, double Caduceus symbols shining
from the back of the van.
Inside the cab, Larry and Frank lean out the front windows
to avoid the king of stink:
LARRY
Faster! God!
FRANK
(flips on top lights)
Faster!
CUT TO:
Larry setting Oh outside the entrance, heading towards the
all night deli. Frank takes out a cigarette.
Mary Burke walks up the drive opening a pack of cigs. Frank
offers her a light. She inhales, exhales:
MARY
It's my first cigarette in over a
year.
FRANK
The first is always the best.
MARY
It's the waiting that's killing me,
not knowing, you know? It's really
hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't
think my father'll make it. He says
he was dead too long, after six
minutes the brain starts to die and
once that goes, close the door.
FRANK
You never know.
MARY
I mean if he was dead, I could handle
that.
FRANK
At least he's got people around him.
MARY
I'm not so sure. My father and I
haven't spoken in three years. When
my brother called to say my father
was having a heart attack, that he'd
locked himself in the bathroom, all
the way going over I was thinking
how I was gonna tell him what a
bastard he was. Then when I got up
the stairs and we moved him onto the
bed, I thought of all these other
things I wanted to say.
FRANK
Even when you say the things, there's
always more things.
MARY
Right now, I'm more worried about my
mother than anything. They won't let
her see my father.
FRANK
Go home. Take her home. Get some
rest. Not going to find anything out
now.
MARY
That's what I told her. If she could
just see him a second, then I could
take her home.
Larry walks back with a coffee for himself and a brown bag
beer for Frank.
LARRY
Time to switch. I wheel, you heal.
CUT TO:
4:00am.
The EMS vehicle drives downtown. The city has
transformed: a deserted city, inhabited by the hardcore:
hardcore night-shift employees, hardcore party-goers, hardcore
druggies, hardcore homeless, people with something special
to do or nowhere to go.
RADIO DISPATCHER
12 David on the corner of Thirty-
eight and Two you'll find a three-
car accident, two taxis and a taxi.
One-two Henry, 427 East Two-two,
report of a very bad smell. No further
information ...
Larry driving at a good clip, riding both the gas and the
break pedals, enjoying the newfound freedom of movement.
FRANK
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're
gonna hafta run one of these calls.
LARRY
Relax, will you.
Frank places both hands on the dash as Larry squeals around
a corner.
FRANK (V.O.)
The biggest problem with not driving
is that whenever there's a patient
in back you're also in the back.
The doors close, you're trapped.
Four in the morning is always the
worst time for me, just before dawn,
just when you've been lulled into
thinking it might be safe to close
your eyes for one minute. That's
when I first found Rose ...
Larry slows down on a side street. Frank turns to watch a
homeless man. The man looks back: it's Rose. The Rose face.
FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
She was on the sidewalk, not
breathing.
Frank turns to Larry:
FRANK (CONT'D)
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I
say we go back to the hospital and
call it a night.
LARRY
You have no sick time, Frank. No
time of any kind. Everyone knows
that.
FRANK
Take me back, put me to bed; I
surrender. We've done enough damage
tonight.
LARRY
You take things too seriously. Look
at us, we're cruising around, talking,
taking some quiet time, getting paid
for it. We've got a good job here.
FRANK
Yeah, you're right.
Larry pulls into the Jacob Riis projects by the river, slows
to a stop.
Larry cuts the lights, not bothering to inform
his partner what his partner already knows: they're taking
a rest.
CUT TO:
13 Zebra sits in the quiet dark. Larry puffs a cigarette.
FRANK
Tell me, you ever think of doing
anything else?
LARRY
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam
next year. After the kids are in
school, Louise can go back to the
post office and, I thought, what the
hell, I'll start my own medic service.
Out on the Island the volunteers are
becoming salaried municipal. It's
just a matter of time and who you
know. Someday it's going to be Chief
Larry calling the shots.
Larry tosses the cigarette out the window, leans against the
door jab, closes his eyes. In a second he's asleep.
Frank turns down the radio volume: the calls are fewer and
further between now. Frank leans back, tries to rest:
FRANK (V.O.)
I'd always had nightmares, but now
the ghosts didn't wait for me to
sleep. I drank every day. Help others
and you help yourself, that was my
motto, but I hadn't saved anyone in
months. It seemed all my patients
were dying. I'd waited, sure the
sickness would break, tomorrow night,
the next call, the feeling would
drop away. More than anything else I
wanted to sleep like that, close my
eyes and drift away ...
TIMECUT: radio wakes Frank from his reverie.
RADIO DISPATCHER
Zebra. One-three Zebra.
(Frank opens eyes)
Zebra, answer the radio. Come on,
I've got one for you. Pick up the
radio and push the button on the
side and speak into the front.
FRANK
(answering call)
Zebra.
RADIO DISPATCHER
Male bleeding, corner of Houston and
One. No further information.
FRANK
Ten-four.
Frank hangs up, bangs Larry's steering wheel:
FRANK (CONT'D)
We have a call Chief. Somebody's
bleeding, Houston and First.
Larry instinctively reaches for the ignition key, starts the
engine, drops the ambulance into gear, hits lights, jerks
the EMS bus away, still half asleep.
CUT TO:
13 Zebra coming to a bone jarring stop at the corner. Getting
out of the techie seat, Frank sees Noel, his face bloody,
charging at him.
NOEL
Kill me!
Noel has sliced up a tire and fastened the pieces with string
over his shoulders. Tin cans circle his wrists and ankles.
One hand carries a broken bottle, the other a stringless
violin.
Frank jumps back inside as Noel rams the window, leaving
stains from his blood-matted dreadlocks. Larry calls for
backup: medics, police, firemen, anybody.
The side window glass bends as Noel rams his head against
it. Frank reaches for the short club between the seats; Noel
holds the jagged bottle to his neck.
FRANK
Noel, don't!
Noel drops the bottle. Frank rolls down the window.
LARRY
He's crazy.
FRANK
You really think so?
NOEL
See, I can't do it. I came out of
the desert.
FRANK
You came out of the hospital. You
were tied down and hallucinating.
You got some bad chemicals in your
head, Noel. There's some medicine at
the hospital that will fix that.
NOEL
No, no medicine!
Noel swings his bloody dreadlocks: Frank ducking, getting
splattered anyway, rolling up the window.
LARRY
He got you.
A BLACK PUNK calls from the crowd:
BLACK PUNK
Do it! Man wants to die. Take him
out! I know how to kill that mother.
(points a finger)
Pop, pop.
Noel, spraying blood, chases the Punk. The crowd scatters.
Noel trips, falls to the sidewalk. Frank, carrying the short
bat, gets out, walks over, hunches beside Noel:
FRANK
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We
have rules against killing people on
the street. Looks bad, but there's a
special room at the hospital for
terminating. A nice quiet room with
a big bed.
NOEL
Oh man, do you mean that?
(smiles)
Thank you man, thank you. How?
FRANK
Well, you have your choice: pills,
injection, gas.
A siren draws closer, Noel gets to his feet as Larry opens
the rear doors.
NOEL
I think pills. Yes, pills, definitely.
A second ambulance skids to a stop. TOM WALLS, 35, a 220
pound bald-headed bruiser, gets out.
LARRY
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy
motherfucker.
FRANK
Used to be my partner.
WALLS
Frank, this the guy you called about?
I know him.
(pushes Noel)
You give my friend here any trouble
and I'll kill you.
NOEL
Yes, at the hospital.
WALLS
This looks like a very bad man I
took in a couple weeks ago, a man
who'd been holding two priests hostage
with a screwdriver. I told him if I
ever caught him making trouble again
I'd kick the murdering life outta
him.
FRANK
It's not worth it, Tom. He's
surrendering.
WALLS
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank,
just a little psychological first
aid.
Walls hauls back, swings at Noel; Noel ducks.
WALLS (CONT'D)
Stay still, dammit!
Walls throws Noel against the bus, knocks him down, sets to
kicking him.
FRANK
Don't do it, Tom!
Noel moans. Larry sticks his head out the back of the bus:
LARRY
There's a double shooting three blocks-
up. First and Third. confirmed.
WALLS
(looking up)
We'll do it.
Walls releasing Noel as Noel scrambles into the bus, Frank
stepping over him, Larry climbing into the driver's seat,
Frank closing the doors. Noel trembles:
NOEL
At the hospital. You told me at the
hospital.
Larry squeals off full gun, all sirens blaring: the Wah, the
Yelp, the Super Yelp. Strobe bar, side strobes, quarter panel
strobes. Rock n' roll.
CUT TO:
Both EMS buses breaking to a stop at the crime scene, cops
holding the crowd back; Walls, Frank, Larry, Walls' partner
moving through the crowd.
FRANK & WALLS
EMS. Move it!
BYSTANDER
Man just walked up and shot 'em. Not
a word. Man, that was cold.
Two boys, DRUG DEALERS, lie bleeding on the sidewalk. Frank
drops to his knees beside one, Walls the other. Larry wheels
out the stretcher.
FRANK
(to Drug Dealer)
Where you hit?
VOICE IN CROWD
Outlaw did this. He works for Cy.
Two white vials roll out of the Drug Dealer's shirt: marked
with red skull and crossbones. Frank looks over--they're
gone, swiped by eager hands.
Listening for a heartbeat, Frank calls to Walls:
FRANK
Major Tom, I'm going to Misery. You
take yours to Bellvue.
CUT TO:
Larry pulls into Our Lady of Mercy Emergency. Frank says to
the boy:
FRANK
It's all right. We're here.
No answer. Frank feels for a pulse, listens with the
stethoscope: nothing. Larry opens the doors.
LARRY
Noel, let's go.
Frank turns to his partner:
FRANK
He's not breathing. Call a code.
Larry and Frank pull the dead boy out of the bus.
CUT TO:
Frank exits, lights up. The sky is going blue. Inside the
open rear doors of 13 Zebra, Larry mops up bloody floor.
Mary Burke, weary, steps beside Frank.
MARY
Hello again.
He offers a cigarette. She accepts:
MARY (CONT'D)
You shouldn't smoke.
FRANK
It's okay. They're prescription.
(beat)
Works better with a little whiskey.
MARY
That's my brother's problem. He's
passed out inside.
Larry jumps theatrically out of the ambulance, swings the
mop wildly over his head:
LARRY
That's it! I can't do it anymore!
Mary laughs once, less than a second. She notices blood stains
on Frank's shirt:
MARY
That boy you brought in, he was shot,
wasn't he?
FRANK
Yes.
MARY
He's dead, huh?
FRANK
Yes.
MARY
(pause)
I think this place stinks.
FRANK
Our Lady of Misery.
MARY
Did you see my father?
FRANK
No.
MARY
It's crazy in there. What's wrong
with that doctor? He keeps mumbling,
poking himself in the eye when he
talks to me.
FRANK
He's working a double shift.
MARY
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the
fuckup. The one on the stretcher in
there--that's supposed to be me.
With my parents crying out here. I
got a lot of guilt, you know what I
mean?
He does.
MARY (CONT'D)
My father's in a coma, now my mother's
going crazy. It's like she's in a
trance.
FRANK
She should go home.
MARY
I'd take her, but then who would
stay here?
Frank looks at her, trying to say the right thing. He notices
Mrs. Burke coming from inside.
FRANK
Here she is.
Mrs. Burke, dazed, steps out. They join her.
MRS. BURKE
It wasn't him.
MARY
You saw him?
MRS. BURKE
They showed me someone. It wasn't
him. It wasn't my husband.
FRANK
Mrs. Burke, please, they'll take
care of him. You should go home now.
MRS. BURKE
I should know my own husband. They
wouldn't let me see him.
She drifts away. Frank speaks to Mary:
FRANK
Larry and I'll drop her back home.
Help me get her to the ambulance.
MRS. BURKE
You want some coffee? I have some
apple sauce cake too.
They walk Mrs. Burke to 13 Zebra.
MARY
Thank you.
Mary watches as Larry backs up the EMS vehicle, Frank sitting
in the back with her mother, pulls into first light.
DISSOLVE TO:
Larry dropping Frank off at the corner of First and Sixteenth,
driving on.
It is as if the sun has risen on a different city, different
from the one which Frank drove through the night before: a
city of crumbling neighborhoods laid bare by sunlight; a
city of day people, getting up, having breakfast, going to
work.
CUT TO:
The maintenance garage and dispatch office adjacent to our
Lady of Mercy.
CUT TO:
12 Young heading downtown, lights off, slowing down for cross
streets. At the wheel: MARCUS, 45, black, reserved, chin
erect, seeming too old for the job. Frank rides techie.
MARCUS
My Lord mother man, you look like
hell. What were you drinking?
FRANK
The captain almost fired me tonight.
I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
MARCUS
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only
thing they might do is transfer you
to the Bronx. You look like you aged
ten years since I rode with you last.
FRANK
The ghosts--
MARCUS
You ever notice people who see shit
always, are crazy?
FRANK
I think the worst is over.
MARCUS
It can always get worse. You can't
change what's out there, only where
you're coming from. You got to let
the Lord take over, in here.
(points to Frank's
chest)
LOVE, a black, tough-talking female dispatcher, comes on the
radio:
DISPATCHER LOVE
Twelve Young.
(beat)
Let's go, Twelve Young. Answer the
radio.
FRANK
Hey, Marcus, it's Love. I haven't
heard her in months.
MARCUS
She only works when I'm on. I make
her wait and it drives her crazy.
FRANK
Is it true that you and Love went on
a blind date?
(Marcus looks away)
She hit you with a bottle?
MARCUS
She loves me the way no woman ever
has.
DISPATCHER LOVE
Twelve Young, I don't have time for
your games. Now answer me or do I
have to come out there myself?
MARCUS
I usually don't do calls before
coffee. But I think it might do you
some good.
(picks up mike)
Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna
take care of you, baby. Don't you
worry about a thing, yahear, cause
Marcus is alive and on arrival.
DISPATCHER LOVE
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not
your mother either. You're going to
a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth,
northeast corner. It's a club. Take
the side entrance.
MARCUS
Ten-four, hon.
(to Frank)
This is for you.
Marcus flips on the lights and siren.
CUT TO:
Marcus grabs the yellow airway bag, leaving Frank to lug the
three heavier pieces as they push their way through the crowd
toward a black jacketed DOORMAN holding a walkie-talkie:
MARCUS
(to crowd)
I hope we're not late from you guys
holding us up here.
CUT TO:
12 Young heading up the avenue.
MARCUS
I ever tell you about the time years
ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying
to talk this psycho inside?
FRANK
Where the guy jumped and you almost
fell. No, you never told me that
story.
MARCUS
No, you never listened. I was going,
man, if someone on high hadn't pulled
me in. I had put all I had into saving
this dumbass lowlife suicidal that
when he went down, there was a part
of me that wanted to go with him.
FRANK
Make a left here. I want to stop.
CUT TO:
Marcus stops the ambulance on 17th Street.
FRANK
I'll be right back.
Frank gets out, walks over to the intercom, pushes the button
for 5A. Mary answers:
MARY (V.O.)
Yes?
FRANK
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the
ambulance last night. I brought your
father into the hospital and I just
learned some news.
MARY (V.O.)
I'll be right down.
Mary appears in a white sweater and simple gray skirt like
schoolgirls wear. The dark makeup is gone. She looks happy.
MARY (CONT'D)
He's better, isn't he?
FRANK
Well, the doctor says he's showing
some movement. It's still early, it
might mean nothing, but I thought
you'd want to know.
MARY
I knew. I sensed it when I heard
your voice.
FRANK
You look so different.
MARY
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night
of the Living Cheerleaders.
FRANK
I think it looks good.
MARY
I was going nuts in that waiting
room so I came back to check on my
mom.
FRANK
How is she?
MARY
Sleeping.
FRANK
I was just going to get some food.
Pizza. Maybe we could.
MARY
You can't kill my father that easy.
He'll fight forever. Like with me:
hasn't talked to me in three years.
But it's okay. Sometimes you have to
put things behind you.
Mary steps to the curb, raises her hand for a taxi. None in
sight.
FRANK
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can
give you a ride if you like.
MARY
(looks at him)
Okay.
Frank opens the back doors of the bus, climbs in behind Mary.
They sit on the bench opposite the stretcher.
MARCUS
Who's that?
FRANK
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest
I brought in last night. I told her
we'd give her a ride back to Misery.
Her father's showing signs of
improving.
MARCUS
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so
much worse than I thought.
FRANK
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some
food after this.
MARCUS
God help us, he's hungry too.
Marcus turns on the radio, an old song from the sixties, as
they head uptown.
CUT TO:
12 Young back on the job, moving with traffic.
MARCUS
Rule number one: Don't get involved
with patients. Rule number two: Don't
get involved with patient's daughters.
You understand?
FRANK
What about rule number three: Don't
get involved with dispatchers named
Love.
MARCUS
You don't know the first thing about
rule number three, cannot begin to
understand the complexities of that
rule. Come on, let's go look at some
hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting
out.
(relevant to nothing)
Don't ever call a junkie whore a
crackhead. They get real mad.
Marcus swings up First Ave:
MARCUS (CONT'D)
Look at these women. You can't even
tell who's a hooker anymore. Whatever
happened to go-go boots and hot pants?
They wear anything now, walk outta
the house with whatever they got
on ...
Frank watches night tableaus (police cars flashing, lovers
kissing, woman crying hysterically, drunken slugfest) as his
mind wanders:
FRANK (V.O.)
The street is so much more
unpredictable than the ER and to
prepare for the unexpected I was
taught to act without thinking, like
an army private who can take apart
and reassemble a gun blindfolded ...
Frank notices another EMS bus: Tom Walls wheeling a stretcher--
Noel, face bloodied, lies restrained as Walls' partner opens
the rear doors.
FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I realized that my training was useful
in less than ten percent of the calls
and saving someone's life was rarer
than that. As the years went by I
grew to understand that my role was
less about saving lives than about
bearing witness. I was a grief mop
and much of my job was to remove, if
even for a short time, the grief
starter or the grief product. It was
enough I simply showed up.
Marcus continues as if uninterrupted:
MARCUS
... look at her. Leaves you no idea
what's underneath, not even a
suggestion. Could be a skeleton for
all you know.
They pass a working girl in a rain slicker who pulls off her
hood to look at them: a familiar face.
MARCUS (CONT'D)
Nice though, pulling back her hood
as we drive by. There's a mystery to
it, then she shows you.
FRANK
She's no whore, Marcus.
MARCUS
We're all whores, Frank. You know
what I'm talking about, the way she
looked at me.
FRANK
She wasn't looking at you, man, she
was looking at me.
Frank, looking back at the Rose face, hears her faintly say:
"ROSE"
Why did you kill me, Frank?
FRANK
I didn't kill you.
Marcus, not hearing "Rose's" voice, replies:
MARCUS
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you.
But there's still a couple hours
left on the shift.
FRANK
I need a drink, that's all.
Dispatcher Love's voice cuts through:
DISPATCHER LOVE
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I
have a call for you.
MARCUS
She said to me, I love the way you
talk on the radio.
DISPATCHER LOVE
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm
holding a priority and if you don't
answer I'm going to knock you out of
service.
MARCUS
(keys radio)
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and
he's gonna help out--just remember,
you owe me.
DISPATCHER LOVE
You're going to three-four Avenue C,
17 year-old female cardiac arrest,
no further information.
MARCUS
Ten-four, hon.
Marcus hits the siren.
CUT TO:
12 Young on the road again, sky turning blue.
FRANK
Don't give me that look.
MARCUS
What look?
FRANK
You know what I'm talking about.
It's all over your face. That I-just-
saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
MARCUS
We just saved a little baby boy.
Think of it that way.
FRANK
I don't want to hear about it, okay?
That's three jobs for the night.
It's over. Three jobs and time for a
drink. Six am, the cocktail hour.
Pass the bottle; I know you're
holding.
Marcus reaches under the seat, pulls a pint of vodka, a quart
of orange juice and two cups out of an old gym bag, passes
them to Frank.
MARCUS
The bar is now open.
Frank mixes a screwdriver for Marcus, straight vodka for
himself.
FRANK
I hate vodka.
MARCUS
Please, a little decorum if you will.
What I was going to say is, is that
holding that baby in my arms, I felt
like I was twenty-one again. A call
like that makes me think of going
back to three nights a week, not
two, start running again, cut down
on the drinking.
FRANK
(pours drink)
I'll drink to that.
MARCUS
(raises cup)
Here's to the greatest job in the
world.
FRANK
(knocks vodka back)
Greatest job in the world.
DISPATCHER LOVE
Twelve Young, I have priorities
holding. Pick up the radio.
FRANK
Don't do it, Marcus. Tell her the
bus died, our radio's not working,
our backs are out. Tell her we're
too drunk to take any more calls.
MARCUS
Let's do it!
(keys mike)
It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
DISPATCHER LOVE
Male diff breather, approximately
30, Houston and A.
MARCUS
Ten-four.
Marcus hits the sirens and lights, accelerates to full speed.
The vodka spills; Frank grabs the dash.
MARCUS (CONT'D)
I'm coming, Love! I'm coming!
Marcus swings the bus wildly to avoid a cab, SKIDS into a
turn--and smack toward a parked truck. Frank covers his face
and screams.
CRASH! The back of the ambulance rams into the truck, the
rear windows shatter.
MARCUS (CONT'D)
Shit.
Frank looks around, realizes no one is hurt. He climbs out:
MARCUS (CONT'D)
Where you going?
FRANK
I quit! I'm through!
MARCUS
You can't leave me now.
Frank walks up Avenue A, leaving Marcus and the disabled
vehicle. The first rays of sun strike the buildings ahead.
CUT TO:
Frank turning the corner, checking his watch, about to enter
the Dark Bar across the corner from the hospital, watching
Noel run past him and away, skipping from one foot to the
other.
FRANK
So long, Noel.
The Emergency doors open: Mary Burke, head down, looking
neither direction, walks away from Frank. Griss steps out
after her. Frank joins him:
FRANK (CONT'D)
What's going on, Griss?
GRISS
Your friend there just untied the
water beggar. Griss was coming out
to thank her. Probably saved Griss a
murder charge.
(about Mary)
Having a tough time of it.
Mary starts to run. Frank follows. She pushes her way through
a group of high schoolers; Frank does likewise, keeping his
distance.
Five blocks later, Mary hesitates at a plaza outside the
Stuyvesant Town projects,
CUT TO:
Frank stops a few steps away from Mary; Mary turns.
FRANK
Excuse me. You seemed like you were
in trouble.
MARY
(steps over)
I'm all right. I just can't stand to
see people tied up.
I'm in the
waiting room for hours, listening to
Noel screaming. The only reason he's
screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
FRANK
Don't seem so bad to me.
MARY
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my
father loose too. They told me he
almost died and five minutes later
they say he's better and I go in.
It's killing me seeing him fighting
like that.
(gazes up building)
Look, since you're here, maybe you
could do me a favor. I need you to
wait for me outside this building,
okay? I have to visit a friend who's
sick.
FRANK
Okay.
Mary takes a few steps, turns back.
MARY
I'm only asking because it's a
dangerous building. There's been
some robberies, a woman was raped
not long ago. This woman I'm seeing,
she'll want to talk to me all day,
but if I can point to you out the
window and say you're waiting, I can
be out quick. if anything happens,
I'll be in apartment 16M.
FRANK
Maybe I should come up with you.
MARY
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes,
hit the buzzer. That way she'll let
me go.
FRANK
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come
with you.
MARY
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting
a sick friend.
She walks into the building. He follows.
CUT TO:
Mary walks a Few steps into the plaza, stumbles; Frank catches
her.
MARY
Let go of me.
(he relaxes)
You shouldn't have come up. I told
you not to. You could have gotten us
both killed.
Mary heads up the avenue: past baby strollers, postal workers,
deliverymen.
MARY (CONT'D)
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell
you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping
people? Well, I've seen him hurt
people. Why are you following me?
FRANK
Because you can barely walk.
Frank walking slightly beside and behind, lights a cigarette.
MARY
You remember Noel, from the other
night, how Noel is now? He wasn't
always like that. He was my brother's
best friend. Cy or Tiger or one of
those other goons put a bullet in
Noel's head. He was in a coma three
months. Crazy ever since.
They stop at a three-story brick apartment building.
MARY (CONT'D)
This is my place.
She unlocks the door. He follows her in.
CUT TO:
Frank walks toward Sixteen XRay as Walls gets out of the
front seat. The EMS vehicle is dented and rusted, a relic of
wars and a hodgepodge of parts.
WALLS
Frank, what do you know. It's you
and me again tonight, the Rough
Riders, tearing up the streets just
like old times.
(kicks the front tire)
This old bus is a warrior, Frank,
just like us. I have tried to kill
him and he will not die. I have a
great respect for that.
Frank makes a "be right back" gesture, walks into ER.
CUT TO:
16 XRay driving past a strip of night clubs and restaurants:
the sidewalks full of young people laughing, jostling,
embracing.
Walls driving. In addition to the EMS two-way and AM radio,
Walls keeps a police band walkie-talkie open. He looks into
the back of the bus:
WALLS
Frank, what you doing back there?
Frank places an open drug box on the stretcher, pulls out an
IV set, wraps a tourniquet around his left bicep.
FRANK
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.
(injects himself)
Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an
amp of glucose and a drop of
adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but
all I got.
WALLS
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling
in the streets.
Frank crawls back in front carrying the IV bag, puts on the
oxygen mask, turns on the main tanks, takes a deep hit.
FRANK
(pulls off mask)
These are hard times, Tom.
WALLS
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
FRANK
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing
me.
WALLS
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's
gonna run tonight. I can feel it.
Our mission: to save lives.
FRANK
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot
of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
WALLS
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
Walls hits the sirens, accelerates.
FRANK
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe
we should go back to the hospital.
WALLS
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care
of you. Put your head out the window,
get some of that summer air. Listen
to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale.
Pronto.
Walls turns up the radio, drums his hands against the wheel.
DISPATCHER
Okay, units, it's suicide hour.
Fourteen Boy, I show you in the
hospital sixty minutes but I know
you're in the diner on 14th. Put
down the burger, I got a call for
you around the corner, 14 and 3rd, a
man with a noose around his neck and
nothing to hang it on. Sixteen XRay,
don't even think about getting coffee,
I have a call for you too.
WALLS
(on radio)
Sixteen XTerminator here. We like
our coffee bloody. Make it good--my
partner's dying to help someone.
DISPATCHER
You're in luck, X: your patient awaits
you with bleeding wrists on Avenue C
and Fourth.
Frank pulls the IV needle out of his arm, searches the glove
compartment:
FRANK
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This
is an ambulance, isn't it?
WALLS
(hitting the gas)
Look out!
16 XRay lurches forward.
CUT TO:
16 XRay brakes to a stop before a duster of derelicts, junkies
and night people. Two DRUNKS are trying to help a friend
with CUT WRISTS.
WALLS
What the hell's going on?
DRUNK #1
You've gotta take him to the hospital.
He tried to kill himself. Show him
your wrist. Show A.
Cut Wrists gets up, leans against the ambulance, shaking.
DRUNK #1 (CONT'D)
See, he ain't right.
WALLS
Hold it. I will not take anyone
anywhere against his will. This is
America. People have rights.
DRUNK #2
He was bleeding before. He kept
spilling his beer. I gave him mouth-
to-mouth.
WALLS
You're lucky you didn't kill him.
(to Cut Wrists)
We're going to hear it straight from
the loony's mouth. Are you crazy?
Did you try to bump yourself off?
CUT WRISTS
(salivatory)
Yesssss.
WALLS
Why didn't you say so.
Walls escorts Cut Wrists into the back of the bus, pulls a
plastic electric patch off the EKG monitor. Frank joins them.
WALLS (CONT'D)
Sir, I am going to give you some
medicine that is still very
experimental. It's from NASA, and
although the astronauts have been
using it for years, we are the first
service to try it. I will put this
patch on your forehead like this,
and in about a minute you will have
to relax.
(places patch)
You will forget all your suicidal
feelings. It's very important that
you wear this for a least twenty-
four hours and keep checking the
mirror. If the patch turns green you
have to see the doctor immediately.
The side effects could be fatal.
Cut Wrists nods.
FRANK
This is the worst suicide attempt
I've ever seen. You feel the pulse?
Here. That's where you cut, and it's
not across, it's down like so.
(takes out his knife)
Here take it.
CUT WRISTS
(shaking)
I can't.
FRANK
With all the poor people of this
city who wanted only to live and
were viciously murdered, you have
the nerve to sit here waiting to die
and not go through with it. You make
me sick. Take it.
Cut Wrists bolts out of the back of the bus, trips as he
hits the ground, runs down the street, turning the corner
still holding the patch to his forehead.
WALLS
We cured him, Frank. When we work
together there's nothing we can't
fix.
CUT TO:
16 XRay parked outside a fluorescent chrome and plastic coffee
shop.
CUT TO:
Frank at the wheel, driving high speed: radio full volume.
WALLS
Whatja doing?
FRANK
I feel the need, the need for speed.
I'm driving out of myself.
WALLS
The brakes are shot.
FRANK
I've taken that into consideration.
WALLS
You okay?
FRANK
I never felt better in my life.
DISPATCHER
Sixteen XRay, XRay.
FRANK
(keys radio)
X.
DISPATCHER
First of all, I want you to know how
sorry I am about this. I've always
liked you two. A unit above none, a
legend in its own lunchtime, so it
hurts me deeply to do this but I
have no choice. You must go to Second
and St. Marks. In front of a liquor
store you'll find a forty year-old
male, unconscious, lying next to his
wheelchair. Do I have to say more?
FRANK
(to radio)
You've said too much already.
WALLS
Mr. Oh.
FRANK
It's early for him.
WALLS
That's all right, we're not meant to
do Oh tonight. Something is going to
happen. I can feel it.
Tom hears something on the police band: a call for units to
Stuyvesant Town.
WALLS (CONT'D)
Bingo.
(keys police walkie)
EMS to Central. What was that call?
POLICE DISPATCH
A jumper. Stuyvesant Town.
WALLS
Ten-four.
One minute out.
DISPATCHER
Sixteen, Sixteen XRay. Level One
Emergency.
But they're not listening--Frank's off to Stuyvesant Town.
CUT TO:
Police cars, fire engines, a massive Emergency Service rescue
truck all flashing dome lights on the street, on the plaza
surrounding Cy Coates' building: cops, Swat team, spotlights,
onlookers.
Frank and Tom, getting out, looking up: the spotlit figure
of Cy Coates, thirteen floors above, suspended on a railing,
legs dangling.
WALLS
Whadda we bring?
FRANK
Better bring it all.
CUT TO:
16 XRay parked in front.
CUT TO:
Frank offers her a cigarette. Walls waits in 16 XRay, now
parked at the curb.
MARY
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He
looked pretty bad.
FRANK
He'll be all right.
MARY
Too bad. He called me up today, can
you believe that? I don't know how
he got my number. He asks me do I
want to come over and see him, I
tell him I'd rather go to a leper
colony. He says there's a new gang
that wants to kill him, take over
the business. I told him I hope he's
right. That they kill him. That's
what I told him.
FRANK
It'll be a while before he's up and
running again.
MARY
OK, last night I was weak. it won't
happen again. And all that shit I
said--it was just because I was
stoned. Forget it.
FRANK
No problem. Thanks for letting me
crash. It was the best sleep I've
had in months. I used some of your
soap.
MARY
I wish these people would leave
already. I can't listen to another
story. Did you see him?
(Frank doesn't answer)
That doctor says the brain is coming
around. They're waiting for the heart
to stabilize. I don't know who to
believe. He says they still have to
keep him tied up.
FRANK
Can I bring you something back to
eat--a falafal, some pizza?
MARY
No, we just ate. I only remember how
tough my father was. Now I know he
had to be like that, to make us tough.
This city'll kill you if you aren't
strong enough.
FRANK
No, the city doesn't discriminate.
It gets everybody.
Walls flashes 16 XRay's headlights, hits the horns.
FRANK (CONT'D)
I gotta go. Another call.
Frank, his heart pounding, steps closer to her.
FRANK (CONT'D)
We're all dying, Mary Burke.
He leans as if to kiss her.
MARY
This is not a good time.
FRANK
There's no time.
He places his hand on her shoulder, kisses her lightly, walks
toward Walls and the waiting ambulance.
CUT TO:
16 XRay is cooking now--Walls at the wheel, Frank shotgun,
passing a pint of whiskey back and forth: radio blasting--
INXS: "The Devil Inside."
WALLS
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug
shooting while you were dicking around
in there. There's gonna be trauma
tonight!
FRANK
As long as we keep moving. No standing
still.
WALLS
(keys mike)
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up
some blood!
DISPATCHER
Sixteen XRay, a man at the bus
terminal shot three years ago says
his arm hurts.
Frank looks at a group of girls exiting an after-hours club:
every one a Rose. Rose faces.
FRANK
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
WALLS
You want some bum in the bus terminal?
We'll wait for a real call.
FRANK
Let's get in a fight, then.
WALLS
Who with?
FRANK
That's your job. Just keep driving,
keep moving. No stopping. We're
sharks. We stop too long, we die.
Walls hits the accelerator: the old bus jerks forward:
FRANK (CONT'D)
Let's break something, Tom. Let's
bust something, bomb something.
WALLS
What do you want to break?
FRANK
(taking a drink)
I don't know--let's break some
windows.
WALLS
Why?
FRANK
Destruction, distraction. I feel the
need.
WALLS
You need a reason, Frank. You don't
just go around breaking people's
windows. That's anarchy.
FRANK
What's the reason? Give me a reason,
Tom.
WALLS
Let me think.
Tom hits the siren as he swings wildly around a stopped cab
and its turban-headed driver:
WALLS (CONT'D)
Classic cabbie move.
(to driver)
Hey, swammy, that's called a
crosswalk. You stop before it, not
on it!
Walls turns onto a cross street, spots Noel standing by a
Mustang, baseball bat on his shoulder. He wears yesterday's
blood-stained clothes, cut tires tied to his shoulders and
elbows, chest and belly wrapped with steel wire.
WALLS (CONT'D)
I know who to work over. Him.
Walls slows as Noel lifts the bat, swings it into the
Mustang's front window, shattering it, puts the bat down,
using it like a cane as he walks to the next parked car.
WALLS (CONT'D)
This guy's been terrorizing the
neighborhood for weeks, ever since
he got outta jail, wreaking general
havoc, contributing to the bad name
of the place. The term "menace to
society" was made up for him.
FRANK
He's crazy. He can't help it.
WALLS
(stops ambulance)
Well, why don't they put him away?
Prisons don't want him. I took him
to the hospital yesterday and here
he is again.
Noel reaches the next car, a Bronco, carefully hefts the
bat, smashes it through the windshield.
WALLS (CONT'D)
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy
person. Every move is calculated. He
knows exactly what he's doing. This
is the guy. I've been after him for
weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat,
tough for one person, but with two
of us--
FRANK
Okay, whatta I do?
WALLS
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll
get out here. You start talking to
him about baseball or something while
I sneak around behind and get down
and you push him. When he falls we
get him.
FRANK
That's ridiculous.
WALLS
Believe me, it always works. The
simpler, the better.
FRANK
You learn that in the army?
FRANK (CONT'D)
Flatbush.
Walls slips out, crouches beside the bus. Frank, stepping
out, walks over to Noel as he whacks the bat through the
hatch of a Pinto.
FRANK (CONT'D)
That's a hell of a swing you got
there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry
in his prime.
NOEL
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.
(heads for the next
car)
Me.
I swing like Reggie. Mr.
October. Number three, game six,
World Series.
Noel hauls back, lays into a Volvo: glass shatters. Noel
holds the bat out, extends handle towards Frank:
NOEL (CONT'D)
Here, you try.
FRANK
No, I'd better not.
NOEL
Sure, sure, give go.
FRANK
Yeah?
Frank, intrigued by Noel's suggestion, has forgotten Walls'
plan. He takes the bat as Tom sneaks behind Noel, crouching.
FRANK (CONT'D)
What the hell.
(spits into hands)
The next year, tiebreaker for the
division, in Boston, Yanks down two
to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the
plate.
NOEL
Oh man, Bucky.
FRANK
The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows
what's coming. He steps in, smash,
over the green monster.
Frank cocks the baseball bat, relishing every moment, swings
into the Volvo's side window. Shattered glass flies on his
hands and clothes.
Walls, fed up with this, stands:
WALLS
Frank, what the hell are you doing?
Noel, seeing Walls, grabs the bat, flees down an alley.
WALLS (CONT'D)
You go down those stairs there. Meet
me back here if you can't find him
in ten minutes. Call out if you see
him. Get with the program, Frank.
Walls takes off after Noel. Frank, taking out his flashlight,
enters second alley, walks down dark stairs which hopefully
circle around to Noel.
CUT TO:
16 XRay parked out front: the sky is going blue.
CUT TO:
Frank walks out of Our Lady of Mercy, heads down the side
street. He passes Tom Walls wielding a giant flashlight,
smashing Sixteen XRay's headlights, denting the hood and
side windows.
WALLS
Die!
CUT TO:
Frank rings the buzzer. Mary, sleepy-voiced, answers:
MARY (O.S.)
Who is it?
FRANK
Frank.
MARY (O.S.)
Come on up.
CUT TO:
