Landon looks urban, prosperous, well-groomed -- but
retains his boyish whimsy and sense of irony. A cell
phone and overnight bag on the seat next to him.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
... and that money or family
background or education or luck
didn't matter.
Landon reaches out to adjust his side mirror, revealing a
simple gold wedding band on his left hand.
EMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor. A tiny plastic
skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror.
Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray.
LANDON
(impatient, edgy)
Where is he? He's supposed to be
here.

CONTINUED:
ERIC
(from back seat)
I need to whizz.
ERIC's skinny, high-energy.
A leg always jiggling.
LANDON
Eric.
You're such a hummingbird.
BELINDA
I wanna dance.
BELINDA is Landon's girlfriend. Richie princess, a bad-
girl pretender. Big shoulder pads. Jellie bracelet.
Swatch watch.
LANDON
So go dance.
BELINDA
With you.
LANDON
I.
Don't.
Dance.
ERIC
(pointing, like
Tattoo)
Dee plane. Dee plane.
They laugh.
Clay's by the dumpster.
Landon's looking at Kelly in the rearview mirror.
(CONTINUED)
5.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
(mocking)
Kelly. He looks like his face
caught fire and he tried to put it
out with a fork.
Landon inches the car forward, teasing Clay, teasing
Kelly.
ERIC
He couldn't find his own butt with
both hands at high noon in a hall
of mirrors.
Sniggering laughter.
CLAY
Go!
Landon presses the gas.
The CAR ROARS away.
CLAY
Kelly's so old he --
LANDON
We're done with that already,
bonehead.
Clay smiles, good-natured.
He often misses social cues.
Landon, Clay, and Belinda sit drinking, smoking weed.
Under the MUSIC, a CB RADIO scanner CHATS quietly.
(CONTINUED)
6.
CONTINUED:
ERIC (O.S.)
So which is it?
Landon, Belinda, Clay, Eric.
LANDON
I'm thinking.
ERIC
No thinking. The doctor only
gives you three seconds to
decide --
LANDON
Could I lose one ear and one nut?
ERIC
No questions, no negotiating --
BELINDA
(to Eric, annoyed)
Where do you get these stupid
questions -- ?
LANDON
Hypotheticals --
ERIC
(to Belinda)
I'm just wondering --
BELINDA
Don't wonder.
Landon's looking out at the night.
(CONTINUED)
7.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
Jamie Sullivan.
Everyone looks up.
Derisive laughter.
THEIR POV
A pale, contemplative GIRL, 17, is jumping down off the
gate, caught in the headlights. Wearing clothes she
probably made herself; long hair hiding her face. She
lives in her mind, not her body.
BACK TO SCENE
BELINDA
Brain.
ERIC
Bible freak.
LANDON
Cherry.
Landon switches on the dome lights for Belinda.
BELINDA
(imitating Jamie)
'Thank you. Thank you so very
much.'
But Landon's looking at Jamie.
Almost counting the
seconds...
HIS POV
Jamie scaling the fence, practiced at it.
BACK TO SCENE
Landon quickly flicks the high beams.
Belinda, Eric, and
Clay snicker and snort as they see --
Belinda, Eric, Clay are still laughing.
Landon's smiling.
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED:
ERIC
Ten years. Where're you gonna be?
(to Belinda, mocking)
Hypothetically?
BELINDA
Paris.
CLAY
Dead.
Laughter.
LANDON
Right here.
With you.
He clinks Eric's raised beer. More laughter. But
Landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where
he'd really like to be.
CLAY
'Twilight Zone.' 'One Step
Beyond.' 'Tales from the Dark
Side.'
ERIC
'Twilight Zone,' dipshit.
LANDON
Don't call him a dipshit.
ERIC
You do --
LANDON
And you don't.
(beat, re: Jamie)
What's she doing in there?
BELINDA
Nothing I'd be doing.
Laughter.
Landon kisses her.
With tongue.
A blinding white light dances through the car and settles
on Landon and Belinda's faces.
LANDON
Shit!
He scrambles out of the car.
Landon leaps in.
Pops out the Van Halen.
LANDON
The address?!
ERIC
York Ave.
Landon pops in a WHAM! tape.
AMPS it UP.
"Freedom."
LANDON
What number?
Nobody answers.
LANDON
Dildoes.
Landon turns the car around.
Landon drives recklessly.
Rushing.
He makes a SCREECHING
turn.
LANDON'S POV - STREET AHEAD
Two fire trucks rumbling by houses, SIRENS WAILING.
11.
Landon smiles at Belinda. She smiles back. Fun. Landon
takes a slug of beer. Turns his eyes back to the road.
LANDON'S POV - FIRE TRUCKS
make another turn. Then a flash of light, movement.
A
figure on the road.
turns the wheel hard.
Jams his foot on the brake.
Quiet.
Landon, Eric and Clay are banged up.
CLAY
Christ, man.
LANDON
You okay?
ERIC
Yeah.
Belinda's head leans on the dash. Her shoulders shake.
Landon, bleeding on the forehead, reaches over. Scared.
LANDON
Belinda?
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
She lifts her head.
Looks at him.
She's laughing.
He
kicks his door out.
Landon's mother, CYNTHIA, 35, drives. She's weary with
sun-worn skin, but still attractive. She wears a skimpy
black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat.
CYNTHIA
What if they expel you?
LANDON
Kelly wouldn't do that.
CYNTHIA
Why not?
LANDON
Cuz nothing happened at school.
He smiles his biggest most reassuring smile.
CYNTHIA
Don't smile at me. It's not going
to get you out of this.
LANDON
Why not?
It always has before.
13.
Mr. Kelly gestures for Landon to sit.
Landon doesn't.
His forehead still shows a bruise.
MR. KELLY
I had hopes for you.
LANDON
Like I'd grow up to be president,
another Reagan.
MR. KELLY
(not laughing)
Like you'd make it to June. Even
cutting half your classes, you
have a B- average.
LANDON
I'm no dummy.
MR. KELLY
That's right.
You just act like
one.
On his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out
of the Camaro.
LANDON
Those aren't mine.
MR.KELLY
They came from your car.
LANDON
I wasn't the one drinking.
Kelly holds up the police test finding.
MR. KELLY
Your blood alcohol level. Maybe
you were legally in the clear, but
I make the rules here.
Landon scowls, knows he's defeated.
LANDON
You expelling me?
MR. KELLY
I am.
(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
Now I can do what I want.
MR. KELLY
That's right.
(sarcastic)
The world is your oyster.
Landon knocks on Cynthia's bedroom door.
LANDON
Mom.
I need a ride.
Dark. She wears a black eye-shield.
Her waitress uniform
hangs over a chair.
CYNTHIA
(sleepy, annoyed)
I'm not getting up to drive you
somewhere.
(beat)
What're you doing home?
Landon is sweating, scouring pots. A crooked cap on his
head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt. He's
making some headway; only two more to wash.
MARVIN, the owner, walks over. Beer belly, greasy hair.
Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's
sink. Landon glimpses his future.
Landon paces, jumpy. Kelly's secretary, MISS TARBOX,
quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer.
LANDON
Who's he in with?
MISS TARBOX
He'll be with you when he's
available.
The door to Kelly's office opens. Jamie Sullivan exits
with her father, the tall stern REVEREND HEGBERT SULLIVAN.
Jamie eyes Landon as she passes by.
LANDON
(joking)
You expelled, too?
Nobody laughs or even smiles.
17.
Mr. Kelly makes a note in Jamie's file.
MR. KELLY
Finding the real world to your
liking, Mr. Carter?
LANDON
I want to come back.
MR. KELLY
(looking up,
surprised)
Back?
Were you ever really here?
They both know Kelly has the upper hand.
Kelly leans back
in his chair, relishing it.
LANDON
(mumbling)
I want to graduate.
Kelly studies Landon, the boy who can't get out of his own
way.
MR. KELLY
(thinking aloud)
You could grace our hallowed halls
again, if, while you're here, you
make a sincere effort to be part
of our little school community --
LANDON
(relieved)
I'd do that --
MR. KELLY
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
Landon shrugs, clueless.
MR. KELLY
(smiling)
Shall I give you a few ideas?
LANDON
(smiling, too)
Please.
MR. KELLY
Besides attending all your regular
classes, I'd like you to help our
janitorial staff after school --
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
For pay?
MR. KELLY
For the inner satisfaction it will
bring.
(beat)
Saturday mornings, I'd like you to
tutor disadvantaged students at
our sister school --
LANDON
(joking)
I'm as underprivileged as they
are --
MR. KELLY
The fact that you attend this
school makes you privileged.
His tone quiets Landon.
MR. KELLY
Finally, I'd like you to join the
drama club. Rehearsals are
Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
LANDON
(grumbling)
I'd work backstage or something?
MR. KELLY
Or something. They're doing a
play for the holidays.
LANDON
When do I get time for me?
MR. KELLY
You don't.
That's the point.
Landon's not happy, but he'll work with this.
As he heads
for the door:
MR. KELLY
(softer, trying to
reach him)
Landon, none of us faculty see you
the way you see yourself.
(beat)
Some of us remember how your
father --
LANDON
Then you remember more than I do.
19.
CLOSE ON BROOM
pushing gum wrappers under a radiator.
Landon sweeps at the floor during the Star Club open
house. A dozen nerds, including Jamie Sullivan (wearing
her brown sweater), stand at astronomy exhibits. Students
wander in, listen, look.
JAMIE
(answering question)
-- Saturn's 15 degrees to the
right of red Antares and much
brighter.
To her small audience, she holds up a contraption made
from a wire coat hanger.
JAMIE
This is a very simple device made
from a coat hanger, plastic wrap
and typewriter correction fluid.
Does anyone know what it is?
No one does.
LANDON
(barely audible)
A star frame.
But Jamie hears.
She regards him a moment, then keeps
going.
JAMIE
This is a star frame.
Clay and Eric enter, checking on Landon, glancing at
Jamie.
JAMIE
A star frame will help you locate
stars and planets with your naked
eye --
CLAY
(scoffing, setting
her up)
-- Did God create the sun?
(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
(taking him seriously)
Yes, God created the universe and
all its physical laws. Even
Einstein said it's a miracle that
our world is comprehensible --
ERIC
-- If God can do all that, why
can't he get you a new sweater?
Landon laughs loudly.
Members of the club look at him.
LANDON
That was a joke. Laugh.
Jamie smiles.
She can laugh at herself.
And she finds
Landon funny.
Landon washes up while his mother sets the table.
The
MICROWAVE HUMS in the b.g.
CYNTHIA
Your father dropped off an extra
check.
LANDON
I don't want his money.
CYNTHIA
It could help with a new car --
LANDON
-- I like the car I have.
He picks up the envelope with wet hands. Without looking
inside, rips it in half. Cynthia smiles, quietly happy.
Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing
"Karma Chameleon." Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading,
not singing. She turns around to look at Landon.
He
rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a
Sony Walkman, glum.
HIS POV
To Z.Z. TOP'S "Sleeping Bag." Out the window -- Jefferson
High School coming into view. Bars on every window,
chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass.
21.
A big room with tables and chairs but few books. Pairs of
heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks. Landon sits
with LUIS, a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity. A geometry
text between them.
LANDON
(reading)
-- 'So what is the measure of
angle x if A and B are similar
triangles?'
Luis is lost, intimidated.
LANDON
Know what 'similar' means?
Luis shrugs. Luis looks down at the book as if for the
answer, then at Landon, hopeless. He gets up and walks
off. Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie
studying him. She's at a nearby table with her student,
ISABEL.
The DOOR SWISHES SHUT behind Landon as he hops aboard.
He's late and heads for the rear bench seat.
LANDON'S POV
Jamie sitting there.
And no vacant seats save next to
her.
BACK TO SCENE
The bus begins to roll.
Landon lurches forward.
TRAVELING - LATER
The bus is moving through Beaufort. Landon sits next to
Jamie. Putting a new tape into his Sony Walkman. His
body turned away. She's reading her book.
JAMIE
You going to visit Harold?
Landon scowls.
What-who is she talking about?
(CONTINUED)
22.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
They let him out of the hospital
yesterday. He's in a rest home on
Oak Street.
That old man.
JAMIE
He goes to my father's church.
He
could've died --
LANDON
-- This your idea of small talk?
JAMIE
I don't make small talk --
LANDON
-- Obviously.
JAMIE
I just wanted to tell you not to
give up. Sometimes you've got to
back into the teaching from
somewhere else.
If he heard her, he makes no sign.
She goes back to her
book. A long beat, then:
JAMIE
What makes you volunteer?
(pause)
Want to know why I tutor reading?
Not really.
JAMIE
Because, growing up, books were my
world.
LANDON
(mean)
Were?
JAMIE
You don't know me.
LANDON
Your book and your brown sweater
and your hair. What's more to
know -- ?
(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
-- I wear the sweater because I'm
cold. I read because no one talks
to me. My hair is my hair. What
is it exactly that's bothering
you?
LANDON
You don't care what people say?
JAMIE
You mean care what you say? I'm
worrying about other things.
LANDON
Like what?
The moons of Jupiter?
JAMIE
Can't you have a normal
conversation?
LANDON
I don't want to have any
conversation.
JAMIE
Good, cuz talking to you is like
trying to explain red to a blind
person.
She reads again. The bus pulls to a stop in front of
Beaufort High. Belinda, wearing a neck brace, is waiting,
leaning on her Cabriolet. Jamie watches Landon exit the
bus.
JAMIE'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW
Landon greeting Belinda, kissing her.
Landon opens a side door, peers in at the Drama Club.
LANDON'S POV
A big space with a stage. MS. GARBER stands before six
geeky boys, and a dozen fat girls and Jamie.
24.
BACK TO SCENE
Landon reacts -- this girl actually chooses to be in these
places? Ms. Garber looks up from her papers.
MS. GARBER
We're waiting, Mr. Carter.
He slides in a row behind the others. Leans forward and
pokes a boy, EDDIE JONES. Eddie's pimply and talks with
his eyes squinched up.
LANDON
What's the play?
Eddie hands him a photocopied script, The Rainmaker.
EDDIE
The-the-there's this drought an'
-- and a smooth t-t-alking guy
comes and says he can m-make
rain --
LANDON
-- And the ugly farmer's daughter
falls for him. I saw the movie.
EDDIE
Yeah.
It's really g-g-good --
LANDON
-- It blows.
ON STAGE - MINUTES LATER
Jamie and Landon sit in folding chairs, reading from
scripts. Landon's wooden, showing how lame this is.
LANDON
(as Starbuck)
'I hope your dreams come true.'
JAMIE
(as Lizzie, sad)
'They won't.'
LANDON
(as Starbuck)
'Believe in yourself and they
will. Let me ask you, Lizzie.
Look in the mirror? Are you
pretty --?'
(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED:
MS. GARBER
-- Landon, are you trying to be
bad at this?
LANDON
No, it just comes naturally.
Jamie smiles.
Garber taps her script -- continue.
LANDON
(as Starbuck)
'It's got to be inside you. Then
one day the mirror will be the
eyes of the man who loves you.
You'll look in that mirror and
you'll be more than pretty.
You'll be beautiful.'
Ms. Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going.
LANDON
(as Starbuck)
'Look at me. Tell me what you
see!'
As Lizzie, Jamie looks into his eyes.
JAMIE
(as Lizzie)
'Is it really me?'
LANDON
(as Starbuck, hamming)
'Yes. You're-you're b-b-
beautiful.'
Hoots and laughter.
Jamie looks away, humiliated.
MS. GARBER
Quiet!
(announcing)
Landon will play the role of Bill
Starbuck.
Groans among the boys.
Jamie is horrified.
So is Landon.
LANDON
(to Garber)
No way. No thanks. I can't do
it --
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
MR. KELLY (O.S.)
(offstage)
-- You can and you will, Mr.
Carter.
Kelly's been standing in the wings.
MR. KELLY
(warning)
With all the sincerity and dignity
you can muster.
Everyone stares at Landon.
He's trapped.
Jamie turns to look at him.
JAMIE'S POV
Landon, wet, desperate, his eyes pleading.
LANDON
(insincere)
We can talk about your helping me
with my lines.
Jamie's at the wheel.
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
I know you don't want help.
LANDON
Then we both know.
(beat)
I'll point. You drive.
Faster.
He points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks.
The wet road glistens.
JAMIE
We're following fire trucks?
LANDON
Yeah.
JAMIE
Why?
LANDON
(duh)
Because that's where the fire is?
He fishes in his pocket for a tape. Pulls one out.
He's
searching the dash -- no cassette player.
LANDON
Fire is like a living thing.
Wild. Unpredictable.
JAMIE
Like me.
LANDON
No.
Not like you.
She jerks the car across the center lane. Driving on the
wrong side of the road. He grips the dash.
LANDON
What the -- ?!
JAMIE
So you agree you need help?
LANDON'S POV - OUT WINDSHIELD
Headlights looming, a car coming.
Closer and closer.
29.
BACK TO SCENE
LANDON
Yes!
She swings the Pontiac back to the right lane. Smiling.
A car zips by in the other direction, HORN BLARING.
JAMIE
Really?
Landon drops his attitude, his act.
He toys with the
glove compartment knob.
LANDON
Yeah. Kelly'll make me leave
school if I screw up the play.
JAMIE
(to herself)
28 and 42.
Pause.
He acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested.
LANDON
What's with the friggin numbers?
JAMIE
28 is do something illegal.
42 is
befriend an enemy.
LANDON
I'm an enemy?
JAMIE
Kinda.
Yeah.
Dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade. Landon
pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie
with her parents. He looks up, aware that the Reverend is
studying him closely.
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
You know our planet would not
suffer for one nanosecond if
humans died off. But if ants
disappeared, that would be
catastrophic.
The Reverend waits, letting Landon suffer the silence.
LANDON
(confidence flagging)
Apropos of nothing... so. So so
so so --
REV. SULLIVAN
Let's get something straight. You
don't know me. I don't know you.
But I know what you're about.
(beat)
Keep your distance from this
house -- and from Jamie.
His eyes lock with Landon's. His message clear. A NOISE
and Jamie is there, carrying glasses of lemonade, all
cheerful.
JAMIE
I miss anything?
Jamie washes the lemonade glasses, happy.
Her father
comes in.
REV. SULLIVAN
The Carter boy. Tell me about
him.
JAMIE
He wants help with his lines --
REV. SULLIVAN
He was driving the car that hit
Harold Keene --
JAMIE
By accident --
REV. SULLIVAN
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.
(beat)
Is this really the best time to be
making a new friend...?
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
I'm supposed to always be alone?
REV. SULLIVAN
I don't want you to see him
outside school activities.
JAMIE
Fine. But I need to start
deciding how to spend my time and
my life.
Pause.
REV. SULLIVAN
(gentler)
I'm sorry your mother isn't here
to help you become a woman.
JAMIE
Dad, I've become a woman without
her. Just not a pretty one.
Jamie hops out of bed, pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt.
Jamie peers into her father's room. He's sleeping.
She
tiptoes to the staircase and down. Sneaking out.
Jamie drops down.
Takes a flashlight from her bag.
JAMIE
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you
can see into another world.
LANDON
(on top of gate)
The world of the dead?
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
(being mysterious)
Could be...
He drops down, not sure what she means.
She's already
walking away. He follows.
JAMIE
My mother's buried near here.
LANDON
My father's alive but it's like
he's dead.
She looks at Landon, feeling his sorrow, then unlocks a
storage shed. Opens the door. Enters. Returns a moment
later carrying several pieces of an odd-looking home-made
cylindrical device.
LANDON
What is that?
JAMIE
(proud)
That is my telescope.
SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER
The ten-inch Dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky.
The eye-piece is at the end of the long scope; the scope
rests on a plywood base. Landon looks through the eye-
piece.
POV (THROUGH TELESCOPE) - CLOSE ON GOLDEN PLANET
a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad, flat
ring system.
WIDEN.
LANDON
(impressed)
Saturn. Beautiful.
JAMIE
Before Voyager we expected maybe a
dozen rings --
LANDON
But there are thousands of them,
made of floating ice --
(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
Maybe debris from a moon that
broke apart.
LANDON
Or building blocks for a world
that never formed.
She looks at him.
He smiles, embarrassed.
LANDON
I'm not smart.
Just a sponge.
She smiles, disagreeing, then looks through the telescope
and changes its view.
JAMIE
Sometimes I come here and just
scan the heavens.
LANDON
(joking)
Looking for intelligent life?
JAMIE
Looking for something -- someone.
Pause.
He doesn't know what to say.
LANDON
Do you believe you'll see your
mother again?
JAMIE
I hope so.
(beat)
I think maybe she sees me now.
Their eyes meet.
She looks away.
Changes the subject.
JAMIE
(re: telescope)
I'm building a larger one to see
the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
LANDON
The dirty snowball at its core.
JAMIE
Yeah.
(beat)
I'm probably not going to be
around next time it comes.
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
In 76 years, me neither.
She likes that he knows a little about astronomy. They
each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars.
LANDON
You're really into God, right?
JAMIE
In ten words or less?
LANDON
Yeah.
JAMIE
My relationship with God is my
own.
LANDON
But you think about Him -- It --
Her.
JAMIE
Don't you?
LANDON
Not really.
Pause.
JAMIE
When you do, how do you?
Landon could joke or he could reveal something.
LANDON
Like in a church painting. I see
this giant hovering over the
ground. He's wearing a robe, and
has long flowing hair, and he's
pointing his finger at something.
JAMIE
Do you ever wonder why things
happen the way they do?
LANDON
No.
(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
I know there's a plan for
everyone, but sometimes I don't
understand what the message is --
or what the point is.
LANDON
There is no point. You live.
You
die. The end.
JAMIE
Maybe we're not supposed to
understand, but we're supposed to
have faith that someone else sees
the big picture.
LANDON
You have to believe to have faith.
JAMIE
You don't believe in anything?
LANDON
The Bible. Why should I read a
bunch of dumb stories about some
ancient guy who supposedly worked
miracles.
JAMIE
Interpreted by another guy like my
father.
LANDON
Your father doesn't like me.
Pause.
JAMIE
He doesn't trust you.
LANDON
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
He sits up and pulls Rainmaker scripts from his back
pocket. He holds one out to her. A moment passes. She
takes it.
JAMIE
I'm not afraid of you.
LANDON
Likewise.
40.
Jamie sneaks from the stairs to her room. Shuts the door.
A light glows under the door, then goes out.
He opens his eyes, listens, then turns over and goes back
to sleep. Not suspecting. Not yet.
Dreary. Landon lies in bed, flipping the TV CHANNELS,
past "Square Pegs," "Miami Vice," MTV, to a British nature
documentary. After a moment, he searches for a pen and
paper. Titles it "Life List." Pause. He doesn't know
what to write.
Cleaned up. Swept out. The Camaro is still a dented
mess. But Landon drops its hood down, wipes his hands,
and climbs behind the wheel. The ENGINE STARTS.
42.
No posters of pop stars. Books by Houston Smith, Thomas
Merton, Alan Watts, Carlos Castaneda. Jamie studies,
listening to JONI MITCHELL's "I Wish I Had a River." The
DOORBELL RINGS.
Jamie opens the front door. Landon. A stern voice from
the living room. Reverend Sullivan's.
REV. SULLIVAN (O.S.)
Better not be the Carter boy.
Jamie shuts the door.
Jamie leans against the closed door, trembling, almost
crying. In the living room, her father looks up from his
reading, sees Jamie, then parts the curtains, looks out,
glowers.
REVEREND SULLIVAN'S POV - OUT WINDOW
Landon standing in the front yard, confused that Jamie
would reject his generous offer of friendship.
44.
Jamie sits on the sofa.
Her father doesn't look up from
his reading.
REV. SULLIVAN
The first time I met him I knew.
I'm proud of how you're handling
yourself.
Tears well and Jamie's face cracks with guilt and
heartbreak. She leaves before her father can see her
distress.
Landon lies in bed watching another British nature
DOCUMENTARY, this one on astronomy. He reaches for his
school yearbook. Flips the pages until he finds Jamie's
photo.
CLOSE ON JAMIE'S PHOTO
She's smiling and looks almost cute. Listed under her
photo are clubs: Red Cross, Stars and Planets, Drama.
Ambition: To Witness a Miracle.
Landon and Luis sit over the geometry text. Landon has
just asked a question and Luis is shrugging sadly.
Landon's eyes wander out the window.
LANDON'S POV - BASKETBALL HOOP
BACK TO SCENE
LANDON
Let's get outta here.
45.
Landon studies the books in the spiritual/religion shelf.
(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:
He picks out a book, then sits in a corner.
But before he opens the text, he looks around him,
suddenly taking in all the books, all the learning, all
the knowledge that could be his.
A full house. Parents, teachers, students, churchgoers,
booster club and rotary members.
ON STAGE
The set is a wealthy Midwestern ranch house of the 1950s.
Eddie and two other BOYS play other characters. The
play's underway...
STAGE LEFT
Landon watches, dressed as Bill Starbuck in a nicely
fitted suit. Waiting for his entrance.
LANDON'S POV - STAGE
BOY #1
(as H.C., the father)
'Then why don't you talk to her?'
EDDIE
(as Jim)
'Because if we do, she'll think
we're trying to get rid of her.'
BOY #1
(as H.C., the father)
'She'll sure think the same if I
do it. You're her father and
comes a time when a father's gotta
mention.'
BACK TO SCENE
From stage right, Jamie makes her entrance as Lizzie.
A
collective gasp from the audience.
47.
LANDON'S POV
Jamie, wearing makeup, a dress that clings, her hair
pulled back.
BACK TO SCENE
Landon can't take his eyes off her.
JAMIE
(as Lizzie)
'Morning, Pop. Boys. I dreamed
we had a rain, rain coming down in
sheets! Lightning flashed,
thunder rolled up and down the
canyon like a kid with a big
drum!'
AUDIENCE
Reverend Sullivan -- enraptured. Principal Kelly --
hopeful. Cynthia Carter -- uncertain. Clay, Eric, and
Belinda -- rocking in their seats, snickering.
JAMIE
(as Lizzie)
'I know why you sent me to
Sweetriver. Six boys in that
family. The first three days, I
stayed in my room.'
BOY #2
(as Noah, the
brother)
'What'd you do that for?'
BACK OF AUDITORIUM
A well-dressed man, DR. JONATHAN CARTER, Landon's father,
slips in and takes a seat a couple of rows behind Cynthia.
JAMIE (O.S.)
(as Lizzie)
'I knew what I was there for and
they knew it, too!'
BACK OF AUDITORIUM - LATER
Dr. Carter hangs on every word. Others sit on the edge of
their seats. Even Clay, Eric, and Belinda. Belinda leans
forward to take a photo.
48.
BELINDA'S POV THROUGH CAMERA LENS
As she ZOOMS -- Landon and Jamie on stage, growing larger.
ON STAGE
Landon, Jamie, and the three boys.
ON STAGE - LANDON
is Starbuck.
LANDON
(as Starbuck,
genuine)
'... You'll look in that mirror
and you'll be more than pretty.
You'll be beautiful. Look at me.
Tell me what you see!'
Jamie looks. She sees something in his eyes she hasn't
seen in them before. Love.
JAMIE
(as Lizzie, choked
up)
'Is it really me?'
LANDON'S POV
Jamie, her face lovely. Her eyes shining, radiating,
looking directly at him.
BACK TO SCENE
Landon is dumbstruck.
LANDON
(as Starbuck,
heartfelt)
'Yes.
(beat)
You're beautiful.'
Landon changes the line and nails it. Surprising himself.
Surprising her. They both know it's sincere. A moment
passes. Her stomach churns with anticipation.
He leans in. She closes her eyes. They kiss. Gently,
genuinely. When Jamie opens her eyes, they are filled
with tears.
(CONTINUED)
49.
CONTINUED:
The curtain crashes down.
End of act two.
CLAPPING from the other side of the curtain. Landon tries
to meet Jamie's gaze. But she's looking at the floor.
AUDIENCE
Principal Kelly, pleased. Cynthia Carter, proud. Clay
and Eric, surprised. Reverend Sullivan, frowning,
concerned. Belinda's face is cold, hard.
Landon waits by Jamie's locker.
The BELL RINGS.
No
Jamie.
Landon walks along the lunch line, looking.
No Jamie.
Many many books. Landon cruises the stacks. No Jamie.
Belinda, sitting at a table with a girlfriend, sees Landon
and turns away. He doesn't pursue it.
Landon's waiting when Jamie approaches her locker. Her
hair pulled back. She looks good in a simple, fresh way.
LANDON
You weren't in school yesterday.
JAMIE
I went to the doctor with my
father.
LANDON
He okay?
JAMIE
Healthy as can be.
Pause. She doesn't help him.
She opens her locker, gets
what she needs.
LANDON
You were great the other night.
JAMIE
Thank you.
So were you.
Pause.
He tries to touch her hair.
She ducks.
LANDON
I haven't been nice to you.
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
You're hardly nice to anyone.
LANDON
(sincere)
I'm sorry.
JAMIE
(walking away)
I wish I could believe you.
Jamie sits alone, reading, wearing her old brown sweater.
Landon walks by Clay and Eric at a table.
ERIC
Landon!
LANDON
Later.
Puts his tray down on Jamie's table and sits.
Making a
public statement.
JAMIE
People can see.
LANDON
And that would ruin your
reputation how?
She goes back to her book.
Ignoring him.
LANDON
(re: her book)
What's that?
She doesn't look up.
Shows him the spine:
The Scarlet
Letter.
JAMIE
I'm reading all the novels on Mr.
Rothberg's best American authors
list.
LANDON
How many books are there?
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
(annoyed)
A hundred. Then there's his
classics list. And his European
list.
Landon realizes this is why she's always reading.
LANDON
That on your 'Life List.'
To read
all those books?
She doesn't deny it.
He just dives in.
LANDON
Jamie. Maybe I want to try being
positive.
She looks up.
Examines his face for the truth.
LANDON
Maybe I miss doing that dumb play
with you.
Students seated near them have overheard.
Whisper.
LANDON
Maybe you inspire me.
JAMIE
That sounds like horseshit.
LANDON
Which part?
JAMIE
All of it.
LANDON
It's not.
JAMIE
Prove it.
She picks up her books and tray.
Everyone is watching.
LANDON
I just did!
Landon sits alone. Legs dangling over. Lighting and
dropping matches into the black beyond his feet. His body
caught in the occasional sweep of car headlights.
Nearby, an abandoned car.
A rusty old Yugo.
Landon comes in from outside. Is surprised to find
Cynthia sipping tea, wearing her uniform.
CYNTHIA
Out with Belinda?
LANDON
That's over.
Way over.
CYNTHIA
I can't know things if you don't
tell me.
Pause.
LANDON
Dad came to the play.
CYNTHIA
(surprised)
You saw him?
LANDON
We talked. He wanted to get a
bite -- after. I said no.
CYNTHIA
(disbelief)
After he moved out, I invited him
to every practice, every game,
every parent-teacher conference
you ever had. He didn't show, not
once.
LANDON
He wants to show now.
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
CYNTHIA
You going to let him? You going
to reward him by being the son he
was never man enough to be a
father to?
Landon doesn't answer.
CYNTHIA
(angry)
You do that.
The door is open to a lab where Jamie and the Star Club is
meeting. Landon mops, working hard, while listening in.
Inside, Jamie ignores him.
Mr. Kelly watches from near the trophy case.
Almost
approving.
MR. KELLY
Mr. Carter. Don't wear a hole in
that one spot there.
Landon grins and moves on. Behind Landon's back, Mr.
Kelly peeks into the science lab. Sees Jamie. Looks back
at Landon. Wonders.
A Christmas party for the tutors and tutored. A ROCK 'N'
ROLL CHRISTMAS CD plays. A raffle ticket box by the door.
A sign reads: "Win Movie Tickets."
Landon enters, buys a ticket, then takes off his leather
jacket. Underneath, a nice shirt and tie.
LANDON'S POV
Across the room -- Jamie, looking pretty in a dress,
laughing with her student, Isabel. Mr. Kelly talking with
MR. REGINALD ADAMS, principal of Jefferson High.
Luis runs over, diverts Landon's attention.
57.
FRONT OF ROOM
Mr. Adams goes to a microphone.
Taps it.
MR. ADAMS
Everyone? Quiet please. As you
all know, we're here to celebrate
the holidays and to raise money to
buy books for our library. The
book drive is being led by
Beaufort High's Jamie Sullivan.
Applause. This is new. Landon looks at Jamie, who's
smiling. She steps to the microphone.
JAMIE
Thank you for buying tickets.
We've raised two hundred and
eighty-five dollars.
More applause.
She steps down.
LANDON AND LUIS
Off to one side.
LANDON
(to Luis)
About enough to buy maybe five
volumes in a set of encyclopedias.
Luis smiles.
Jamie overhears.
JAMIE
It's a start.
LANDON
Yeah, with a finish in about a
decade.
She smiles.
He looks at her.
LANDON
So you're talking to me?
JAMIE
When I have something to say.
He smiles.
LANDON
What's number one on your list?
She shakes her head.
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
My number one would be getting out
of Beaufort.
JAMIE
Getting out won't be your problem.
It'll be figuring out what you
want when you get somewhere.
She walks away.
LANDON
What does that mean?!
JAMIE
(turning back)
It means you can do anything.
Landon smiles, not sure why she believes in him.
Dark save for a gilded fake tree lit with tiny blinking
lights and the glow of Cynthia's cigarette in the dark.
CYNTHIA
Landon! Come enjoy the tree!
Landon?!
Landon comes down the stairs. Sits on the sofa.
Wearing
another good shirt. She tries to reach out.
CYNTHIA
You look nice.
I should have
dressed.
LANDON
You're fine like that, Mom.
CYNTHIA
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
LANDON
(not moving)
Thanks.
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:
CYNTHIA
I haven't seen Clay or Eric
lately.
LANDON
Me neither.
CYNTHIA
No great loss --
LANDON
I need to go out.
Pause.
CYNTHIA
(hurt)
To see your father?
LANDON
No.
I won't be long.
He senses her hurt, but leaves anyway.
A Christmas tree with large colored lights stand in a
corner. Jamie and her father playing cards. The DOORBELL
RINGS. Then urgent BANGING.
JAMIE/REV. SULLIVAN
(recognizing)
Landon Carter.
Jamie hums to herself as she brushes her hair. She's
wearing the new sweater. Her father KNOCKS. Enters.
REV. SULLIVAN
What's Landon Carter up to?
JAMIE
(innocent)
Up to?
REV. SULLIVAN
I thought we had rid ourselves of
his disagreeable companionship.
JAMIE
Dad, why don't you get to the
point where you get to the point.
REV. SULLIVAN
Why is he giving you a gift?
Jamie doesn't answer.
REV. SULLIVAN
Did you give him a gift?
JAMIE
No.
REV. SULLIVAN
I saw the way he looked at you.
The way he kissed you.
JAMIE
It was a play.
REV. SULLIVAN
(unconvinced)
Boys like him have --
expectations.
JAMIE
I have expectations, too.
Pause.
He's feeling her grow up, grow away.
REV. SULLIVAN
I'm not changing the rules.
JAMIE
I haven't asked you to.
They eye each other.
He's losing her.
61.
A nurse points Landon toward a patient room.
He carries a
battered liquor-store box.
A TV flickers. Landon comes in. Opens the box.
Pulls
out the evergreen wreath with the plaid bow.
LANDON
For me. Christmas is all about
the smells.
Landon leans the wreath in the window. HAROLD KEENE --
the old man from the accident, watches from his bed,
baffled.
LANDON
Pine's my favorite. That and
cider with cloves.
Landon pulls a Thermos from his coat pocket.
Unscrews the
cap. Finds a drinking cup. Pours in cider.
Offers
Harold the cup.
HAROLD
Who are you?
LANDON
Landon Carter.
I was driving the
car that --
HAROLD
You.
LANDON
Me.
Harold takes the cup, looks Landon over.
Landon appears
genuinely contrite.
LANDON
I'm very sorry --
HAROLD
What kind of a man are you, son?
Pause.
LANDON
(honest)
I don't know that I am -- a man.
Yet. I'm working on it.
(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED:
Pause.
HAROLD
I've worked on it my whole life.
Harold reaches under his pillow.
Pulls out a small bottle
of liquor. Tops off his cider.
HAROLD
Get yourself a glass.
LANDON
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits
for the drive home.
Harold nods, liking Landon.
HAROLD
You'll sit a while.
LANDON
I will.
Landon turns OFF the RADIO. Sits still. Wipes the
rearview mirror clean, spotless. Unties the dangling
plastic skeleton and pockets it.
Kelly looks up from paperwork.
MR. KELLY
Landon?
Landon drops a folded wad of hundreds on the desk.
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
For Jefferson High. For books.
MR. KELLY
(suspicious)
Where did you get -- ?
LANDON
(angry)
It's mine to give. I didn't steal
it.
MR. KELLY
I didn't say you did.
But his tone implied it and Landon's already gone. Kelly
is immediately sorry. He goes to his window and sees
Landon pedal away on the old bike.
Landon looks into the Reverend's office.
LANDON'S POV
Reverend Sullivan is sitting behind his desk, examining
legal-looking documents and records. He takes his glasses
off, rubs his eyes.
BACK TO SCENE
Landon knocks.
The Reverend looks up, furrows his brow.
LANDON
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you
something?
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
REV. SULLIVAN
Does it have to do with Jamie?
LANDON
Yes, sir.
The Reverend makes a small motion and Landon enters.
Landon doesn't sit.
LANDON
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner
on New Year's Eve.
REV. SULLIVAN
That won't be possible.
He looks back to his papers.
End of conversation.
LANDON
I'm sorry I haven't always treated
Jamie the way -- I should have.
She deserves better.
Reverend Sullivan glances up.
As if surprised Landon is
still there.
LANDON
I care for her.
REV. SULLIVAN
I don't want to see her hurt.
LANDON
I wouldn't do that --
REV. SULLIVAN
This week.
LANDON
Ever again.
The Reverend looks out the window. A gray day, cold,
bitter, stark. He considers his options.
REV. SULLIVAN
Have her home by one. And drive
carefully.
67.
Landon's under the Yugo's hood.
Josh, the kid from next
door, is in the driver's seat.
LANDON
Start the engine.
Josh turns the key. Nothing happens.
Under the hood,
Landon changes something.
LANDON
Again.
Josh tries the engine again.
Still no go.
Landon changes
something else.
LANDON
One more time.
Josh tries one more time. The ENGINE ROARS, then DIES,
then amazingly STARTS again. It's running. Landon high-
fives Josh, then sees an old station wagon turn in.
Kelly hands a paper to Landon.
MR. KELLY
Your grades for fall semester.
They're -- good.
LANDON
(incredulous)
You came here to give me my report
card?
MR. KELLY
I've seen students with records
like yours go to J.C. for a couple
of years, then transfer to a good
college.
Landon understands what Kelly is implying.
MR. KELLY
I'd gladly write you a letter of
recommendation.
LANDON
Thank you.
MR. KELLY
You're welcome.
They shake hands.
68.
Landon, dressed with care, faces the mirror and wet combs
his hair.
A seafood joint on the waterfront. Quaint, not fancy.
Twinkle lights illuminate Jamie's face. Landon finds her
lovely. Jamie picks.
JAMIE
I can't believe you asked my
father's permission.
LANDON
I wanted this to be a date.
She watches Landon, happy, then perplexed.
JAMIE'S POV
Landon wolfing down his food.
BACK TO SCENE
JAMIE
Is there a rush?
LANDON
I have to get you home by one.
JAMIE
It's only 7:30.
LANDON
We're going somewhere. After.
And no. I didn't ask your father.
Landon drives. The CARS' "Tonight She Comes" PLAYS.
He
belches loudly, dramatically.
JAMIE
Excuse you.
LANDON
Your turn.
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
(laughing)
No.
LANDON
I know you want to.
She grins.
And tries.
A small burp.
LANDON
Bring the air all the way up from
your stomach.
He belches again.
Just as loud.
She tries again,
laughing.
Jamie sees where they are.
LANDON
Before we do this.
JAMIE
We're doing something -- ?
LANDON
Before we do this, I just want to
say that a good life's gotta be
about more than achieving stuff --
like on your list.
She waits for more.
LANDON
It's about working with what you
already have -- right now -- at
your fingertips -- you know,
spontaneously.
JAMIE
What are you talking about?
LANDON
That little bit of larceny in your
heart.
(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
Excuse me?
LANDON
Fun.
Jamie's in the cage with a helmet on.
A machine tosses
balls. Landon coaches from outside.
LANDON
Swing! Keep your bat parallel to
the ground. Follow through.
Follow through!
Jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything. The balls
keep coming. She ducks out of the way and grasps the
fence and leans in. Landon leans in on his side. They'd
be embracing if the fence weren't there.
In the b.g., kids from their school.
Giggling,
whispering.
Landon looks over at them.
LANDON
(to Jamie)
Let's go.
Jamie and Landon.
With STEVIE NICKS' "Talk to Me" ON the
RADIO.
LANDON
The cells in our bodies are always
changing. In six or seven years
all your cells have changed. You
could be like a completely new
person from the inside out.
JAMIE
That what's happening to you, only
faster?
(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:
He grins.
Pulls the car over.
LANDON
Get out.
Come on.
He leaps out, leaving the headlights on.
Landon and Jamie arrive at his locker.
It's been kicked
in.
LANDON
Assholes.
This happen to you?
JAMIE
Twice a year.
Bang, bang, bang. Landon kicks in every locker in his
row. A dozen in all. Jamie watches, a little frightened
by his anger. But then he turns to her and grins.
LANDON
Now they all match.
Landon eats alone, ignored by Eric and Clay. Jamie
approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful.
She hesitates about sitting -- feeling bad that Landon's
being diminished, ostracized. She thinks he doesn't see
her. But as she turns to leave, he pulls a chair out for
her and smiles. She sits. Landon sees her face.
LANDON
What's wr--?
JAMIE
(choked up)
The Challenger exploded.
Principal Kelly's about to make an
announcement.
The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM CRACKLES.
Landon takes Jamie's
hand as the room hushes.
LANDON
Come on.
JAMIE
Where?
LANDON
Away from here.
Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed.
His feet find slippers
on the floor.
Reverend Sullivan, wearing a robe, enters quietly.
Checking on his daughter. Her bed is empty.
Reverend Sullivan looks down the access road to the rear
cemetery gate.
REVEREND'S POV
The Yugo parked by the gate.
BACK TO SCENE
The Reverend struggles with what to do. After a moment,
he decides not to interfere; he'll pick his moment. He
keeps driving.
Jamie and Landon are looking at the heavens through the
telescope.
LANDON
Where's Pluto?
JAMIE
In Virgo, but it's about 1000
times too faint to see.
LANDON
What's the best thing I can see
tonight?
JAMIE
Me.
He draws her close, they kiss. She shyly pulls away.
Their hands still touching until she looks again into the
telescope eyepiece.
JAMIE
The second best thing is Jupiter.
She swivels the telescope into position for Jupiter and
steps aside so he can look. But he picks up the
flashlight, pulls a diagram from his pocket.
LANDON
Can you locate XXI5639I?
JAMIE
Sure.
She takes the diagram, studies it, and adjusts the scope.
(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
Here.
Why am I looking at this
star?
LANDON
Because I had it named for you.
I
know it's not an official
designation --
She couldn't be happier.
She reaches for his hand.
JAMIE
It's wonderful. I love you.
It's the first time he's heard it. He pulls her into his
arms. They kiss. Passionately. She starts to object.
LANDON
(respecting her
boundaries)
Okay.
I'm stopping.
And he does.
They snuggle.
Silence, then:
LANDON
What's number one?
Long pause.
JAMIE
(very shy)
In April when the dogwoods and
wisteria are blooming... Get
married.
He doesn't make fun.
He strokes her hair.
Kisses her
forehead.
Landon enters from outside. Cynthia, still in her
waitress uniform, is sitting at the table, drinking
coffee.
CYNTHIA
A late night or an early morning?
LANDON
(honest)
Late night.
(smart-aleck)
You?
(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED:
CYNTHIA
Were you with Jamie?
LANDON
Yeah.
CYNTHIA
You sleeping with her?
Landon doesn't dignify this question with an answer.
CYNTHIA
I was cleaning yesterday.
I found
this.
She pulls Landon's Life List from her pocket.
Landon is
horrified. She reads it.
CYNTHIA
Scuba dive. Touch a moon rock.
Learn to read Egyptian
hieroglyphs. Go to college?
(pause)
She talking to you 'bout this
stuff?
Landon doesn't answer. She puts the list on the table.
Smoothes it. Gently discouraging.
CYNTHIA
Honey, some of this is...
farfetched. You take after me.
People skills and common sense.
Good dependable qualities.
LANDON
I could take after Dad, too.
CYNTHIA
You do. You're handsome and
charming.
LANDON
I meant he's a doctor.
CYNTHIA
That's eight years of school and
training -- after college. And
all that doesn't necessarily make
you a better human being.
LANDON
I could do it if I tried.
Even
Kelly thinks so.
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
CYNTHIA
That'd be something.
She doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to
be practical and realistic.
CYNTHIA
But if it doesn't happen, grab for
something within reach. Life's
tough enough without causing
yourself disappointment --
LANDON
(angry now)
Whatever my life is, I'm going to
be friggin' sure I'm never
disappointed --
CYNTHIA
(honest)
Disappointment isn't something
anyone plans for.
(quieter)
It catches you by surprise.
Long pause.
They are both sorry to have raised their
voices.
CYNTHIA
Have I told you how proud I am of
you -- ?
LANDON
Mom, great. But what I want is
for me to be proud of me.
Landon eats dinner with Jamie and Reverend Sullivan.
Silence, then:
REV. SULLIVAN
Landon.
You're not the quiet
type.
LANDON
No.
REV. SULLIVAN
So talk to us about something.
LANDON
Like what, sir?
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
REV. SULLIVAN
You decide.
Landon searches his mind for just the right subject.
REV. SULLIVAN
How about your family?
LANDON
Okay.
Sure.
(beat)
My grandfather. When he was
seven, he shook the hand of an old
guy, a war vet or something, who
had once shaken President
Lincoln's hand.
(pause)
Made a big impression on him.
Reverend Sullivan looks at his daughter.
She's nodding,
interested.
LANDON
My cousin Mike. He's from a big
family. He's the fifth kid. He
heard that every fifth child in
the world is Chinese. So he
thought he was.
Jamie smiles.
LANDON
We didn't tell him any different
for years --
REV. SULLIVAN
(getting to the
point)
Your parents are divorced?
LANDON
Since I was five. My mom's a
cocktail waitress.
REV. SULLIVAN
How do you -- the two of you --
get by?
LANDON
Materially or spiritually?
REV. SULLIVAN
(surprised)
Either. Both.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
(honest)
I don't know. We used to try to
believe in each other.
His eyes meet the Reverend's.
The Reverend's got to
respect him some.
Reverend Sullivan looks out the window into the back yard.
HIS POV
Jamie showing Landon the junk pile that will become her
newer, larger telescope. They are laughing, jostling each
other, comfortable, happy.
Reverend Sullivan and Jamie put the dishes away.
REV. SULLIVAN
You and the Carter boy. Want to
catch me up on recent
developments?
JAMIE
You're asking if we're involved?
REV. SULLIVAN
I'm asking how much.
JAMIE
Dad --
REV. SULLIVAN
It's time to tell him.
(pause)
It would be the right thing.
She turns to him, upset.
Her anger spilling out.
JAMIE
Maybe. But that's not the real
reason. You think if I tell,
he'll disappear and that's what
you want! Me all to yourself!
(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:
REV. SULLIVAN
(calm, stung)
No.
I want what's best for you.
JAMIE
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's
best for me!
REV. SULLIVAN
You're sure?
You're sure you can
trust him?
He's playing to her old insecurities.
She's not one
hundred percent sure.
REV. SULLIVAN
(gentler)
Isn't it better to know?
Their eyes meet.
She knows he's right.
WHITNEY HOUSTON's "How Will I Know?" ON the RADIO. Jamie
flips the RADIO OFF. She's got something on her mind.
Landon notices only that she seems a bit remote.
LANDON
You're worried about your college
applications.
JAMIE
I'm not applying to college.
LANDON
(stunned)
But you said --
JAMIE
No, you assumed.
He looks at her, questioning.
She's looking out her
window.
LANDON
You're going to take a year off?
Join the Peace Corps -- ?
JAMIE
No.
LANDON
What are you going to -- ?
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
Pull over.
LANDON
Where?
Why?
JAMIE
Pull over.
Now. Please.
Tears are running down her face.
He pulls the car over.
The Reverend and Landon drink coffee.
REV. SULLIVAN
It's her decision and she's
decided not to tell people -- at
least for now.
LANDON
How -- how long does she have?
REV. SULLIVAN
Two, three months. Maybe less.
Maybe more.
LANDON
So you've given up.
Reverend Sullivan hears the challenge in his voice.
REV. SULLIVAN
Her doctors have. Jamie and I.
We're still praying for a miracle.
LANDON
(disdainful)
Praying.
REV. SULLIVAN
Landon. We've lived with this for
over a year now and --
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
If there is a God, how could he
let this happen??!!
It's a long answer and by the time the Reverend opens his
mouth to explain, Landon's out the door.
Elegant, thick carpets. Dr. Carter, putting on his robe,
parts the silk drapes in the upstairs hall.
90.
DR. CARTER'S POV
His son standing on the front lawn.
Distraught, tearful.
LANDON
Open the door!
Please!!
Landon quietly shuts the back door.
Exhausted.
Starts
making coffee. Cynthia appears.
CYNTHIA
Your father called.
No response.
CYNTHIA
Jamie's a patient at his hospital.
He's having a colleague look at
her chart this morning.
Long pause.
CYNTHIA
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
LANDON
I didn't know either.
Jamie looks out the window.
JAMIE'S POV
Landon pacing, talking to himself.
92.
BACK TO SCENE
She starts to raise the window, to say something, to help
him, but then lets the curtain drop. She needs for him to
decide, for him to be ready to face this with her.
The sound of a CAR.
She looks out the window again.
JAMIE'S POV
The Yugo driving away.
Landon lies on his bed in the dark. The PHONE RINGS.
Landon stares at his extension. The RINGING STOPS. A
voice from downstairs.
CYNTHIA (O.S.)
It's your father.
Landon picks up his phone.
The door to Landon's room is ajar. Cynthia waits outside.
Listening. Hearing nothing. She pushes the door open.
CYNTHIA'S POV
Landon sitting on his bed.
Deflated.
LANDON
He can't do anything.
BACK TO SCENE
Cynthia is pained to see his suffering.
CYNTHIA
If it's incurable --
LANDON
I told him to leave me alone.
CYNTHIA
Landon --
LANDON
(re: Jamie)
It was the only thing I've ever
asked him!
93.
Landon's still in bed. Facing the wall.
Cynthia KNOCKS.
Enters with a plate of food.
CYNTHIA
I brought some dinner.
No response.
She leaves the tray and goes.
Jamie and her father eat dinner.
Jamie is red-eyed,
heartbroken.
JAMIE
(not sure at all)
He'll call.
REV. SULLIVAN
I wanted to think he'd changed.
JAMIE
(angry)
No you didn't.
(beat)
But he did change. Just not
enough.
REV. SULLIVAN
Jamie, you're not mad at me.
You're mad at Landon --
JAMIE
(furious)
I am mad at you! And at Landon!
And the universe! And God!
(quieter)
I don't even know where to put all
my anger.
REV. SULLIVAN
That's normal. God accepts your
anger. He won't punish you.
JAMIE
By making me ill, he is punishing
me!
(quieter)
I just don't know what for.
She flees the room.
94.
ANOTHER ANGLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Goes up the stairs.
Keeps going.
Up another flight to
the attic.
Jamie opens a closet door. Pulls out a dress, a scarf,
jewelry, a worn book -- her mother's belongings. She
opens the book and starts to weep. Missing her mother.
FOOT OF ATTIC STAIRS
Reverend Sullivan stands, looking up at the attic stairs.
Frustrated, angry, worried.
Landon is still in bed. Cynthia enters.
Pulls back the
curtains. Yanks up the shades.
CYNTHIA
I don't care if you don't leave
the house. But you have to get
out of bed.
Landon sits at the kitchen table.
Cynthia pours him a cup
of coffee.
CYNTHIA
You and I may not be communicating
very well right now. But let me
be clear. Don't make this about
you. It's about her.
Pause.
Her words sink in.
LANDON
I have no idea what to say. How
to act. What if I do the wrong
thing?
CYNTHIA
(gently)
Be yourself and I don't think
there is a wrong thing.
(beat)
Let Jamie take the lead. She'll
let you know what she needs.
95.
Deserted, classes are meeting. Landon runs, sliding to a
stop at one classroom door. Looks in, keeps going, stops
at another. Searching.
This is JAMIE'S POV from the top of the hallway.
JAMIE
She stands, holding her books, watching him, unsure.
LANDON
finally feels her gaze, turns to look.
JAMIE
turns away, still angry and disappointed.
LANDON
runs to her.
LANDON
Jamie!
He catches up to her.
JAMIE AND LANDON
face each other.
Neither sure what to say.
LANDON
I'm so sorry.
I'm a coward --
(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
I should have told you sooner --
LANDON
(guilt-ridden)
I made you do too many things,
kept you up all night --
JAMIE
No. The drugs just stopped
working. If anything, doing
things I love kept me healthy
longer.
Pause.
LANDON
Are you frightened?
JAMIE
All the time.
(beat)
I feel like I have no one.
She means not even God and he gets this.
LANDON
You have me.
He hugs her close, rocking her, comforting her and
himself.
JAMIE
Help me live until I die?
LANDON
I will.
A small group of students sit on stage reading from Our
Town, rehearsing. Jamie and Landon sit together in the
third row, holding hands. Landon glances at her, realizes
she's asleep. Pulls her sweater over her.
Landon sits with Luis; Jamie at the next table with
Isabel. She looks pale. He catches her eye. They both
smile, a little sadly, then turn back to their students.
97.
Landon drives them home from Jefferson High.
No music.
LANDON
They're going to build a tunnel
under the English Channel.
They're calling it The Chunnel.
No response.
LANDON
You hungry?
JAMIE
Nope.
LANDON
Anything you want.
JAMIE
Nothing.
He reaches into a cooler on the floor of the back seat.
LANDON
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt?
You
like yogurt.
JAMIE
I used to like yogurt.
He places a red heart-shaped box in her lap.
LANDON
(apologetic)
Not very original. Happy
Valentine's Day.
He grins.
She looks crestfallen, feels terrible.
JAMIE
I didn't even think about it.
He takes a chocolate.
Pops it in his mouth.
Grins.
LANDON
There.
You gave me a chocolate.
LANDON'S POV (THROUGH JAMIE'S TELESCOPE) - VAST STAR
FIELD
PULL BACK to reveal...
98.
Landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out
Jamie's locker.
Students stare as he carefully places her things,
including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag. They part
and hush as he passes by. News travels fast. Clay and
Eric step forward.
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
CLAY
Hey.
Landon.
ERIC
We heard 'bout Jamie Sullivan.
She --
LANDON
(fierce)
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
ERIC
(misunderstood,
genuine)
No.
Hey. We're sorry, man!
Landon turns back. Surprised.
Inspects Belinda.
Eric.
Clay. Others. No one speaks.
LANDON
Too late and not enough.
He pushes past Belinda's new boyfriend, heading for the
office.
Mr. Kelly and Landon.
LANDON
I know it means not graduating,
but I need to be excused from all
school acti--
MR. KELLY
You're excused.
Landon heads for the door.
MR. KELLY
How is she?
Landon can't answer.
Too emotional.
MR. KELLY
You will graduate.
Landon looks up, astounded.
MR. KELLY
If I have to tutor you myself.
Landon nods, accepting, appreciative.
101.
Landon puts away the contents of the shopping bag.
Jamie's in bed, wearing the sweater.
JAMIE
Yesterday I felt sick, horrible.
Today I feel like riding my bike.
Or dancing.
He turns on the CLOCK RADIO next to her bed. Finds a
WALTZ. Offers his hand. Pulls her out of bed. She's in
pajamas.
JAMIE
You know how to waltz??
LANDON
(bashful)
I was going to fake it.
JAMIE
I always fake it.
So they waltz, faking, stumbling and laughing, holding
each other.
Reverend Sullivan hears the MUSIC and LAUGHTER.
He
frowns, afraid for Jamie's health.
Jamie grips Landon's arms, seems to slip, suddenly too
exhausted to carry her weight. Landon picks her up,
gently carries her back to bed. Settles her in.
LANDON
How you doing?
JAMIE
(murmurs)
Tired.
Landon sits on her bed. Strokes her hair. They look at
each other. Landon reaches for her hand. When he looks
at her face again, she's asleep.
Eric and Clay spy Landon.
Jamie wakes from a nap. She looks thinner, grayer. She
hears HAMMERING. She hauls herself up and to a window.
JAMIE'S POV
Landon working on the new telescope.
He looks up at her
window. Sees her there. Smiles.
BACK TO SCENE
Reverend Sullivan comes in to check on Jamie.
She's
standing at the window.
REV. SULLIVAN
What's that boy doing?
She turns to look at him and collapses into his arms.
Jamie lies in bed, eyes closed. Hooked to monitors,
pumps, an IV drip. Landon holding her hand. Reverend
Sullivan talks quietly with a doctor. Hearing bad news.
Landon, in yesterday's clothes, dozes lightly. Jamie
moves and he starts, fully awake. She opens her eyes.
LANDON
You okay?
She nods. Sleepy. Closes her eyes again. He rests his
head on her shoulder and weeps. Her eyes open, then close
again. There's nothing to say.
Reverend Sullivan looks through the window in the door at
the scene within. He hesitates, then pushes the door
open.
104.
Reverend Sullivan enters.
REV. SULLIVAN
Landon.
You go on home.
LANDON
I'm not tired.
REV. SULLIVAN
I need to be with her.
There's only one chair.
Landon nods and goes.
The Reverend sits, closes his eyes a moment.
When he
opens them, she's looking at him.
JAMIE
Dad.
He kisses her forehead, then sits back.
JAMIE
So serious.
REV. SULLIVAN
Jamie, God is not punishing you.
No God I know wants anyone to be
sick or feel pain or suffer.
Pause.
JAMIE
When Mom died you told me God
wanted her more, loved her more --
REV. SULLIVAN
I was wrong. Nobody could have
wanted or loved your mother more
than we did. Not even God.
He lets this sink in.
REV. SULLIVAN
God loaned you to me, entrusted
you to my care. I'm failing you.
She looks away, agreeing without saying so.
REV. SULLIVAN
Jamie. I make you the same
promise that God does.
(beat)
I will always be with you.
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
She sits up and embraces him. He wraps his arms around
her. Tight. She closes her eyes, tears welling, never
wanting to let him go. Her father.
Landon picks up a pile of books and assignments.
Looks through them, then eyes Miss Tarbox.
LANDON
Where's Jamie's book?!
MISS TARBOX
That's everything Mr. Kelly gave
me.
LANDON
(insistent)
The next book on that list!
The
Old Man and... and...
MISS TARBOX
The Sea.
LANDON
Yeah.
I need it today!
Mr. Kelly steps out of his inner office.
Sees Landon's
anguished face, his exhaustion.
MR. KELLY
I'll drive a copy over to her.
Landon nods his appreciation.
Jamie looks smaller. Her eyes have blue circles beneath.
The Hemingway novel on the bedstand. Belinda pushes the
door open. Peeks in. Not sure she is welcome.
Landon is sitting in a chair.
He sees her, motions for
her to come in. Quietly.
BELINDA
She asleep?
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
I'll tell her you were here.
Pause.
Awkwardness.
BELINDA
Give her this, okay?
She hands Landon a small photo album.
BELINDA
Pictures from the play.
Jamie
looks pretty --
LANDON
I'm sorry about how we --
BELINDA
(conciliatory)
No.
You're with who you should
be.
It's like she chose you.
LANDON
(agreeing)
And I have no idea why.
BELINDA
I do.
She hugs him quickly, then leaves.
Landon goes to the
window, looks out.
SAME SCENE - HOURS LATER
The sky is grayer, darker.
Landon is still at the window.
Jamie wakes.
JAMIE
Hi.
He goes to her side.
LANDON
Hey.
He kisses her.
JAMIE
I have something for you.
She reaches under her pillow for the worn book from the
attic. She offers it to Landon.
(CONTINUED)
107.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
(smiling)
Don't worry. It's not a Bible.
He takes it.
JAMIE
My mother made it for me before I
was born.
(beat)
It's got quotes from famous
people. Her favorite lines from
books. Her thoughts.
Landon looks at a page.
LANDON
(reading)
'What is a friend? A single soul
dwelling in two bodies.'
Aristotle.
JAMIE
Lower.
Same page.
LANDON
(reading)
'Find out who you are and do it on
purpose.' Dolly Parton.
A bookmark falls out.
He studies that page a moment.
CLOSE ON PASSAGE
from Corinthians.
BACK TO SCENE
Landon reads it.
LANDON
'Love is always patient and kind.
It is never boastful or
conceited -- '
JAMIE
That was read at my parents'
wedding.
He takes her hand.
Holds it.
(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
How're you doing?
JAMIE
(looking away)
Better. I was really angry.
LANDON
I know.
JAMIE
It's gone now.
LANDON
(gently)
Because you have hope that you'll
get better?
JAMIE
No.
(pause, shrugging,
accepting)
Maybe I believe God has a bigger
dream for me than I had for
myself.
(beat)
Maybe I believe the journey, the
big adventure, never ends...
He kneels on the floor.
Puts his head on her pillow next
to hers.
JAMIE
Maybe I believe God sent you to me
because I am ill. To help me
through.
He touches her face tenderly.
JAMIE
(almost whispering)
I want to go home.
Pause.
He gets her meaning.
LANDON
(trying not to
break)
I'll talk to your father.
JAMIE
(looking away)
It's not that simple.
(pause)
It costs money to do this at home.
109.
Cynthia pacing, talking on the phone, worried.
The front
door is wide open.
CYNTHIA
(into phone)
... He doesn't talk to me, maybe
not to anyone, except Jamie...
She stands in the doorway and looks out.
CYNTHIA'S POV
Landon in his car in the driveway.
Landon just sits.
Exhausted, despondent.
Cynthia pacing.
CYNTHIA
(into phone)
... I've never asked you for
extra. But we need it now... as
soon as possible...
Jamie's breathing is shallower. Landon's reading her The
Sheltering Sky. He pauses, looks up. Isabel, Jamie's
student, is standing in the doorway. Jamie sees her too.
She smiles weakly.
JAMIE
Isabel?
ISABEL
(shy)
Hi.
Isabel comes in. Landon offers her the book. She takes
it and keeps going from where Landon left off. Stumbling
but reading. Jamie grins.
JAMIE
Who's been working with you?
Isabel looks shyly at Landon. Jamie shakes her head,
amazed. Landon nods to Isabel and she begins reading
again.
110.
Landon enters, but doesn't sit.
LANDON
(to his father)
What are you doing here?
CYNTHIA
He wants to talk to you.
LANDON
(to his mother)
Now it's okay?
CYNTHIA
Landon. You have two parents.
We're both here for you even --
DR. CARTER
-- even if we're not here for each
other anymore.
Landon is listening.
DR. CARTER
I want to do this. Please let me.
He holds out a check.
For a lot of money.
Landon takes
it. Grateful.
LANDON
(quietly, to both
parents)
Thank you.
A smaller Jamie lies in a hospital bed, seemingly asleep.
Hooked to an IV. Bottles of pills. Landon dozes in a
comfortable chair. A nurse sits in a corner, reading.
(CONTINUED)
111.
CONTINUED:
Eric and Clay stand in the doorway, not sure what to do.
Jamie opens her eyes, smiles.
JAMIE
Don't wake Landon.
They tiptoe in.
Stand on either side of her bed.
JAMIE
Do I look scary?
ERIC
Not too bad.
CLAY
You all right?
A dumb question but she handles it well.
JAMIE
(smiling)
Things could be better.
Awkward pause.
CLAY
We thought you'd be asleep --
JAMIE
(trying to help)
I don't know what to say either.
Clay hands her an envelope.
JAMIE
What is it?
She pulls out a stack of worn bills.
CLAY
For the book drive.
Landon told
us about it --
ERIC
We told everyone at school.
Jamie takes their hands, holds them. Thanking them
silently. Her eyes shining with tears.
Landon sits at his desk, sketching the larger telescope,
making a few computations.
(CONTINUED)
112.
CONTINUED:
A library book on Haley's Comet is open.
A stack of
similar books by his elbow.
Cynthia enters wearing her waitressing outfit.
CYNTHIA
What can I do?
He shrugs.
Tears fill his eyes.
LANDON
Everything's being done but it's
not enough. I have to find
something -- more.
CYNTHIA
(gently)
Landon, honey. There's nothing
more.
LANDON
I don't mean about Jamie being
sick. I mean about Jamie and me.
CYNTHIA
Be with her when she wants.
Make
sure she never feels alone.
Landon thinks his mother is also talking about herself.
LANDON
Mom, I'm not going anywhere.
Not
yet anyway.
Pause.
CYNTHIA
When you are ready, I want you to
feel free to go.
They embrace.
Landon opens Jamie's mother's book.
A photo of Jamie
falls out -- one taken by Belinda.
CLOSE ON PHOTO
Jamie, beautiful, smiling at the audience.
113.
LANDON
considers the photo, finds a page to tuck it into.
CLOSE ON HANDWRITTEN JOTTING
"For Landon" above some underlined text, a Psalm from the
Bible.
LANDON
(reading aloud)
'I cry to you my Lord, my rock!
Do not be deaf to me, for if you
are silent, I shall go down to the
pit like the rest. Hear my voice
raised in petition as I cry to you
for help, as I raise my hands, my
Lord, toward your holy of holies.'
Landon knows Jamie underlined this for him.
Landon tears down the steps. Past his mother to the front
door. He's out the door before she even turns around.
Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed. His feet find slippers
on the floor. He looks haggard, his hair thinner, his
face defeated.
The Reverend, wearing his robe, checks on his sleeping
daughter. The night nurse nods as he tucks in blankets.
A SOUND. Then another. Reverend Sullivan goes to the
window. Parts the drapes. Looks out.
HIS POV
A dozen flashlights in a big circle. Landon in the
middle, working feverishly on the new telescope.
Landon stands in the doorway. The Reverend is wiping his
glasses, his face, maybe of tears. He sees Landon.
REV. SULLIVAN
You finish?
LANDON
A few minutes ago. I have to ask
you something.
Long pause.
REV. SULLIVAN
When I was seventeen, I was sent
up for a year for stealing a car.
(beat)
Sometimes I still feel that boy
inside me and I don't like him.
(beat)
But I like you.
The Reverend stands, offers Landon his hand.
Landon takes
it. The two men shake. Allies now.
Jamie opens her eyes. But can barely keep them open.
Groggy from pain medication. Landon's standing there.
Showered, clean clothes.
(CONTINUED)
116.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
We're going out.
He starts helping the nurse disconnect her IV.
JAMIE
Can I -- go out?
LANDON
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Jamie looks at the nurse.
Uncertain.
The nurse nods.
Bursting with everyone who knows Jamie and Landon -- every
kid in their high school, including Eric, Clay, Belinda;
teachers, including Ms. Garber; Mr. Kelly; Luis and Isabel
and others from Jefferson High; her father's congregation;
Cynthia Carter; Dr. Carter's new wife and their two kids;
neighbors; hospital staff and home nurses.
Landon stands with his father by the altar.
The "WEDDING MARCH" begins...
The double doors at the back of the church open. Everyone
turns to look at the bride. Gasps of joy and sadness.
LANDON'S POV - JAMIE
Flanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan. She's wearing
her Lizzie dress from the play. It hangs loosely, but
still becomes her. She's a beautiful bride.
BACK TO SCENE
Landon swells with pride.
Jamie smiles. Then, leaning on her father, she slowly
makes her way down the aisle.
In the pews -- few dry eyes follow her.
Jamie -- halfway -- stops to rest and catch her breath.
A
moment later, she and her father continue.
A long, difficult walk.
A walk to remember.
AT ALTAR
The nurse rolls a wheelchair up as Jamie and her father
near.
Applause breaks out as Jamie reaches Landon's side.
Jamie sits.
Exhausted.
(CONTINUED)
119.
CONTINUED:
Landon kneels to be the same height as Jamie in her chair.
Pause.
Dr. Carter kneels.
Showing solidarity with his
son.
Reverend Sullivan, standing, leans down to kiss Jamie's
cheek. Trying to keep his emotions in check.
LANDON AND JAMIE'S POV
Reverend Sullivan towering over them.
BACK TO SCENE
Reverend Sullivan kneels, too.
Jamie takes Landon's hand in her right hand, her father's
hand in her left. Linking the three together.
The congregation silences.
Reverend Sullivan looks up from his Bible.
Struggling.
REV. SULLIVAN
As a father, I'm supposed to give
away my daughter. But I can no
more give Jamie away than I can
give away my heart. But I can let
another share in the joy she has
given me. May God's blessings be
with you both.
He reaches out, offering a hand to Landon.
Completing the
circle.
REV. SULLIVAN
Landon, repeat after me. Do you
take...
As words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged, the
CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the faces of those at the altar --
Jamie, Landon, Dr. Carter.
TO the first row of the congregation -- Cynthia Carter,
Josh, Eric, Clay.
Then BACK row by row as the Reverend begins reading a
passage from the book Jamie's mother made for her. His
voice soft and melodious, like a poet reading his own
work.
(CONTINUED)
120.
CONTINUED:
REV. SULLIVAN (O.S.)
'Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous. Love is
never boastful or conceited. It
is never rude or selfish. It does
not take offense and is not
resentful. Love takes no pleasure
in other people's sins, but
delights in the truth. It is
always ready to excuse, to trust,
to hope, and to endure whatever
comes...'
And the CAMERA MOVES OUT the double doors to find...
PARSONAGE
in a different season.
Winter.
UP the front steps and INTO...
LIVING ROOM (PRESENT DAY)
As it is now, in present day.
The nurse disappears, leaving Landon Carter, 33, waiting.
Looking at a framed photo of Jamie as Lizzie in The
Rainmaker...
The nurse returns, helping an old man as he shuffles in.
Reverend Sullivan. He's stooped, thin, balding. His skin
parchment thin.
The two men embrace.
Stiff, uncomfortable, uncertain.
REV. SULLIVAN
You've been well?
LANDON
Yes.
You?
REV. SULLIVAN
Getting by.
Pause.
Why is he here?
The Reverend waits.
LANDON
(fumbling)
I'm -- I'm returning something.
He twists the ring on his finger.
Removes it.
(CONTINUED)
121.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
This belongs to you.
He gives his wedding ring to the Reverend.
Pause.
Landon
searches for something meaningful to say.
LANDON
She taught me -- everything.
She
saved my life.
The Reverend turns away, overcome with sadness.
Realizing
now why Landon has come.
REV. SULLIVAN
You're marrying again.
LANDON
Yes.
REV. SULLIVAN
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
Landon is grateful to know this.
He makes a move to go.
Then turns back.
LANDON
I'm sorry she never got her
miracle.
REV. SULLIVAN
She did.
It was you.
Landon, deeply touched, embraces the old man again.
Warmly, fully. Two men still grieving, saying good-bye.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
Jamie once said when you're
feeling love, you're also feeling
God.
