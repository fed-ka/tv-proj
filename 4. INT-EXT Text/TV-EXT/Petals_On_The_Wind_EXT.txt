      1972. Foxworth Hall has been restored to its full glory.  
      Formal gardens boast gleaming statuary.  Ivy creeps up the *
      polished brick walls all the way up to the attic.   

      A WOMAN speaks.  This is CATHY, now an adult, her teenage *
      bitterness since tinged with strength, wisdom.  *

                                  CATHY (V.O.)
                    We were just children when we lost *
                      everything.  Our parents, our *
                    home... our innocence and our hope.  *
                    Once the envy of all our neighbors, *
                    now we were stranded at a bus *
                    depot, thirty dollars in our *
                    pockets and not a prayer in sight.   *

      We see A PLUME OF SMOKE streaming from the dormer windows. 
      Suddenly, the GLASS SHATTERS. ANGRY FLAMES lick at windows 
      and doors, spreading rapidly across the attic and down the 
      stairs.  

                                  CATHY
                    But God was looking out for us.  
                    And we learned to trust again, 
                    believe in second chances-- even 
                    me.  Like a fairy tale princess, 
                    finding her happy ending.  

      The entire estate is engulfed in an UNCONTROLLABLE BLAZE.  
      Soon BLACKENING, COLLAPSING into a charred, unrecognizable 
      heap.

                                  CATHY (V.O.)
                    Or the Phoenix, rising from the 
                    ashes...

      Her V.O. dissolves back to...



      Julian s SPORTS CAR races up the driveway.  Cathy stumbles 
      out, giggling and a little tipsy.  The car PEELS OFF, the 
      wheels kicking up a storm of dust and gravel.  

      At the entrance, Cathy fumbles through her purse for her keys 
      when the door swings open.  It s Christopher.  He looks 
      worried.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    It s two a.m..  Where ve you been? 

                                  CATHY
                          (annoyed)
                    Out.   

      She pushes past him, heads inside.



      Cathy stares at herself in the mirror, still groggy from the *
      previous night.  Incredulous of what she did.  Then, behind *
      her, she notices Christopher admiring her-- just like he did *
      in the attic ten years earlier. 

      Only this time, Cathy s not flattered... or surprised.  
      Instead, she looks regretful, ashamed.  So does he.*

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                            (consoling)*
                    I wanted it as much as you did.*

                                  CATHY
                    It doesn t matter. *
                          (then)*
                    After all these years, I ve tried *
                    so hard to forget these feelings...*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    We both have.  *
                          (then)*
                    It s just hard because it feels so *
                    right.*

      He moves closer, kisses her shoulder.  She closes her eyes, *
      sighs.  In another context, it s almost romantic.  But here, *
      she quickly shakes it off with a shudder.*

                                  CATHY*
                    But it s not.   We can t do this *
                    again-- we can t be together.   If *
                    anyone found out...*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    Nobody ever will.*

      Christopher nods and pulls back.  Unhappy-- but he s knows *
      she s right.   *

      FROM THE DOORWAY -- we see CARRIE, who s standing behind the *
      door, which is slightly ajar.  She s overheard the entire *
      conversation.*



      Christopher races up to find Cathy loading her bags into a 
      TAXI.   

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Cathy-- stop! 

                                  CATHY
                      Christopher, what re you doing 
                    home?

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Henny told me your plans.  You 
                    can t go to New York.

                                  CATHY
                    It s where all the major ballet 
                    companies are.  If I want to have a 
                    real shot of making it as a dancer--
                    of achieving any kind of success or 
                    fame...*
                          (then)*
                    All those years we were locked up, 
                    this is what I was dreaming about.  
                    What I worked so hard for.   *

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    But you promised we d always stay *
                      together-- me and you, and Carrie. *

                                  CATHY*
                    We can t be our parents, *
                      Christopher.  We can t make their *
                    same mistake.  We have to focus on  *
                    becoming successful, force *
                    ourselves to love other people...   *

      From Christopher s hurt look, it s clear there won t be any *
      others.  But he concedes.*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    If this is what you really want...?*


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:1919

                                  CATHY*
                    It s what I need.  What we both *
                    need.   *

                                  JULIAN (O.S.)*
                    Cathy, you coming? *

      Christopher whips around to find Julian behind him, exiting 
      the taxi.  He stares at Cathy, who instantly pulls away from 
      her brother.  Christopher looks like he s been punched.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    You re going with him?

                                    JULIAN*
                          (glaring at him)*
                    What the hell s that supposed to *
                    mean--?*

                                  CATHY*
                    Julian, please-- I ll be right *
                    there.*

                                    JULIAN*
                    Well, hurry up.  We re gonna miss *
                    our flight.*

      Julian hops back into the taxi.  Christopher looks pleadingly *
      at Cathy, one last time.*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    He doesn t love you, Cathy...*

       Like I do  is left hanging.  Cathy looks torn, but quickly *
      steels herself. 

                                  CATHY
                    I m sorry, Christopher, but I won t *
                    be like mom.  I have to make a life *
                    for myself.   

      Cathy joins Julian in the cab.  As they pull away from the 
      house, Christopher s left alone... devastated.  

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                        ACT TWO

      Christopher walks Sarah to her front door.   

                                  SARAH
                    Well, this is me.

      She looks at him, waiting for something.  He puts out his 
      hand to shake.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (a little unsure)
                    Uh, thank you?  I had a nice time 
                    tonight.

                                  SARAH
                          (laughing)
                    Haven t you ever been on a date 
                    before?

      Christopher grimaces wanly.  Sarah realizes he hasn t.  

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    Oh God.  People at the hospital 
                    kept telling me you re  that way. 
                          (off his confusion)
                    You know, funny... queer.

      He looks taken aback.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    That s what people think?

      Sarah realizes her gaffe, feels bad.

                                  SARAH
                    Well, I didn t think so.  It s just 
                    talk, anyway--  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    I m not.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:2929

      Suddenly, he takes her by the shoulders and KISSES her.  
      Passionately.  A long beat as Sarah melts in his arms.  He s 
      definitely not  that way.  

      Suddenly, he pulls back-- surprised by what he just did.  
      Contrite, even.  He likes Sarah but we can tell his real 
      passion lies elsewhere.

                                    CHRISTOPHER (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  

      He quickly heads down the path.  But Sarah just grins to 
      herself.   

                                  SARAH
                    I m not.



      Carrie reluctantly exits onto the deserted roof.  It s dark, 
      high above the ground-- and she looks petrified.  She stays 
      close to the door, not daring to look around... or down.   

                                  CARRIE
                    Tucker... Tucker?

      No answer.  She takes a few more steps out when she hears the 
      door swing open.  Relieved, she spins around.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Tucker, thank God, I thought you 
                    weren t-- 


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:3131

      But it s LACY in the doorway, along with her friends.  

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Lacy.  What re you doing up here? 

                                  LACY
                    I should ask you the same thing.

                                  CARRIE
                    None of your beeswax.

      Carrie tries to walk to the door, but Lacy blocks her. 

                                  LACY
                    Well, I certainly hope you weren t 
                    meeting a B-O-Y.  Because Miss 
                    Calhoun would be very upset.

                                  CARRIE
                          (realizing)
                    This was your idea.  You made 
                    Tucker ask me up--

                                  LACY
                    Carrie, you shouldn t let your 
                      imagination run wild.  Or your 
                    temper.  It s so unbecoming of a 
                    lady.

      Before Carrie can stop her, Lacy exits, SLAMMING the door 
      shut behind her.  Upset, Carrie jiggles the doorknob-- but 
      it s locked!  A look of PANIC washes over her.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Open the door... OPEN IT!  SOMEBODY 
                    GET ME DOWN FROM HERE!  GET ME DOWN 
                    FROM HERE!  

      Her panic and humiliation quickly escalates into sheer 
      terror.  Carrie screams, howls, pounding and kicking on the 
      doors until her knuckles and feet are bloody.  *



      JULIAN is being congratulated.  He looks almost shell-shocked 
      by his news.  He turns to Cathy, elated.

                                  JULIAN
                    I got it.  I m going to be the 
                    Prince!  

                                  CATHY
                    I- I m so happy for you. 
                          (then)
                    Who got Sleeping Beauty--?!

      She rushes over to the bulletin board, pushes past the other 
      dancers to scan at the list.  She searches further and 
      further down for her name.  It s clear she has a background 
      role.  

      Disappointed, she turns around to find Yolanda standing 
      behind her.  Cathy swallows the ten pound lump in her throat, 
      then smiles wanly.   

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                      Congratulations.

      Yolanda excitedly pushes her way to the bulletin board-- 
      she s Sleeping Beauty!   The other dancers start 
      congratulating and hugging her.  Cathy looks pained.  Julian 
      approaches.

                                  JULIAN
                    A bunch of us are going out to 
                      celebrate.  You coming?

                                  CATHY
                    Um, I m pretty tired--

      But he hasn t even waited for her answer.  He s halfway out 
      the door, his arm hooked into Yolanda s.



      Dawn.  Julian stumbles in, drunk.  Cathy s waiting on the 
      sofa, her bags packed.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:3434

                                  CATHY
                    Fun night?

      He doesn t answer.  Goes straight to the sink.  Splashes his 
      face with cold water.   

                                  JULIAN 
                    Make me some coffee, will you?

                                  CATHY
                    I m going home.  The train leaves 
                    in an hour.

      Now he looks up, notices the suitcase.  Gets angry.

                                  JULIAN
                    What?!  

                                  CATHY
                    Just for a week.  Christopher s 
                      graduating from medical school.  
                    I m his only family--  

                                  JULIAN
                    What about rehearsal?  Or is my 
                    debut not important enough for you?*

                                  CATHY
                    I m just background.  I ll explain 
                    it to George--

                                  JULIAN
                    You are NOT going anywhere... 
                    unless I say so!  

      He stumbles towards the bedroom.  A beat, then she picks up *
      her suitcase and slips out.



      Graduation.  GRADUATES and their PROUD FAMILIES celebrate, 
      pose for photos.  Cathy finds Christopher across the 
      courtyard, approaches.   He looks stunned.   

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Cathy?  I didn t think you d come. 

                                  CATHY
                      I couldn t miss this.  
                          (then)
                    We re all we ve got.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:3535

      A charged beat as they look at each other, unsure what to 
      say.  The tension-- and longing-- between them is palpable. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    How s New York?  

                                  CATHY
                    Good.  Great.  The dance company 
                    keeps me busy. We re doing 
                     Sleeping Beauty  next month.  
                    Julian s playing the lead.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Yeah?  And how  bout you?  He s 
                    good to you, isn t he?

      Cathy chokes back her sadness and just nods.  But she can t 
      hold it in.  She starts to reach out to him, her voice 
      cracking.

                                  CATHY
                      Christopher, I- I missed you--

      Suddenly, Sarah appears with a bright smile, cuts Cathy off.   

                                  SARAH
                    You must be Cathy!   
                          (nudges Christopher)
                    You didn t tell me your sister was 
                    coming! 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    I didn t know.

      Cathy looks at Sarah, then to Christopher.  He smiles wanly.

                                    CHRISTOPHER (CONT D)
                    Sorry-- Cathy, this is Sarah 
                    Reeves.
                          (loaded)
                    My girlfriend.

      Cathy sucks in her breath.  Then attempts a smile.

                                  CATHY
                    Nice to meet you--

      Sarah ignores Cathy s outstretched hand and gives her a HUG.

                                  SARAH
                    If you re anything like your 
                    brother, I know we ll be close.

      In the background, GRADUATION MUSIC begins to play.  


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)3535

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Looks like procession s about to 
                    start.

                                  SARAH
                          (to Cathy)
                    You re coming to the luncheon at 
                    our house tomorrow?  My father s 
                    throwing it for Christopher... 
                    since your own parents couldn t be 
                    here.

                                  CATHY
                    I d love to but... I have rehearsal 
                    back in New York.  I can t afford 
                    to miss more than a day. 

      Sarah links her arms in Christopher s, walks off.  Cathy s 
      grin quickly disappears.



      Cathy wakes up, alone, on the floor-- a little disoriented.  
      It s painful but she gets up and heads to the bathroom to 
      look in the mirror...



      Christopher looks around when he hears a familiar GIGGLE 
      coming from one of the dressing rooms.  He smiles to himself 
      as he reaches the door, then looks in and STOPS IN HIS 
      TRACKS.

      CHRISTOPHER S POV:  Carrie s with Julian, in his  Prince  
      costume, who s showing her a dance move-- but his hands 
      linger on Carrie s chest and down her back.  Upset, 
      Christopher interrupts them. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:4444

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                      Carrie--?! 

      Surprised, Julian immediately lets her go.  Carrie bites her 
      lip, a bit guilty.  Brushes herself off.

                                  CARRIE
                      Christopher?  Cathy said you were 
                    coming tomorrow.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    I took an earlier flight.  
                          (looking around)
                    What re you doing here?  Don t you 
                    have homework or something?  

                                  CARRIE
                          (trying to sound upbeat)
                      I finished.  So Julian promised to 
                    show me how to do a fish dive.   

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (glaring at Julian)
                    So that s what you re calling it? 

                                  JULIAN
                    It s a classical ballet move.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Well it looks a bit dangerous.  For 
                    someone Carrie s size.

                                  JULIAN
                    Don t look so worried, Doctor.  I m 
                    not going to break her.   

      He brushes past Christopher, who s not so sure. 



      An elegant society function.  WELL-DRESSED LADIES in hats and 
      silk dresses, mingle over mint juleps and tea sandwiches.  
      Sarah makes her way through the crowd, a little star-struck.  
      Suddenly, her high heel STICKS in the grass and SHE BUMPS 
      INTO A WOMAN, WHO SPILLS HER DRINK.

                                  WOMAN
                    My dress--!

                                  SARAH
                    I m so sorry, my heel caught-- 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:4545

      The woman whips around.  It s Corrine.  Her eyes flash with 
      anger.  Flustered, Sarah just blurts out.

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    You re Corrine Foxworth.
                          (confesses)
                    I- I follow you in the society 
                    pages every week.  Oh God, I hope I 
                    didn t ruin your dress?!  You 
                    always wear the most beautiful 
                    ones.

      Corrine softens instantly.  Smiles warmly.

                                    CORRINE
                    Don t worry.  The drink barely 
                    splashed it...?    

                                  SARAH
                    Sarah Reeves.  Greenglenna, South 
                    Carolina.  

                                    CORRINE
                    Oh yes, my husband grew up around 
                    there.  In fact, he s thinking of 
                    opening an office nearby... if your 
                    husband ever needs legal advice.

                                  SARAH
                    Thank you.  Actually, I m not 
                    married-- not yet.  My boyfriend 
                    can t commit to anything until he 
                    finishes his medical residency...

                                    CORRINE
                          (impressed)
                    Well, I hope it works out.  I ve 
                    always wished I had a doctor in the 
                    family. 

                                  SARAH
                    Do you have any children?

                                    CORRINE
                          (without missing a beat)
                    No.  Never.
                          (then, exiting *
                            conversation)*
                    Well, if you and your boyfriend are 
                    ever in Virginia, give us a call.

      Corrine hands Sarah a calling card and walks off.  Thrilled, 

      Cathy spots Julian getting into his vintage sports car.  


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:4747

                                  CATHY
                    Julian, wait--! 

      Before he can pull away, she jumps in the passenger seat.   
      Julian quickly drives off in a fury... 



      The sports car RACES through the streets, weaving through the 
      city traffic, over sidewalks, past construction barriers... 
      and the wrong way down a one-way street.  

      Suddenly, a TRUCK comes from around the corner.  The car 
      SWERVES to avoid it but TOO LATE-- he skids wildly, CRASHING 
      into a telephone pole... and BURSTING into flames.  

      It s hard to imagine there will be survivors. 

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                        ACT FOUR



      Carrie and Alex are on their picnic date.  Alex is talking 
        passionately about church hymnals.

                                  ALEX
                      ...Between the choir bake sales and 
                    the collection plate, we ve raised 
                    almost enough money to go to the 
                    Choral Festival this spring.   

                                  CARRIE
                          (excited)
                    Down in Macon?  Which hymn would we 
                    do?

                                   ALEX
                    I enjoy  Praise His Name  but I was 
                    thinking of trying out  Children, 
                    Go Where I Send Thee ...
                          (she gets a funny look)
                    Unless you don t like that one?

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh, no, that s one of my favorites.  
                    Just, my father-- stepfather used 
                    to sing it to me.  Whenever I had 
                    bad dreams.

                                  ALEX
                    It s hard to imagine any bad 
                    thoughts going through your head.

      Carrie smiles wanly.  A beat as Alex gazes at her.  Almost 
      reverentially.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    You know, most girls your age are 
                    only interested in the latest 
                    hairstyle or movie magazine.  But 
                    you re different... more innocent.  
                    Pure.

                                  CARRIE
                    I just like singing, that s all.

      A little embarrassed, Alex pulls back.

                                  ALEX
                    You must think I m a real square.  
                    Talking about choir music...   

                                  CARRIE
                    No, I don t-- really!  I like it.   


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:5353

      She instinctively puts her hand on his knee.  He examines her 
      small, delicate hand, lovingly pressing it into his own.

                                  ALEX
                    Carrie, you-- you re like a 
                      beautiful, precious doll.

                                  CARRIE
                    Alex...

                                  ALEX
                    It s only been a few months, but I 
                    I know, deep in my soul, that 
                    you re good. 

      He pulls a small box from his pocket to reveal a MODEST 
      ENGAGEMENT RING.  

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    I m not the richest or best looking 
                    or most exciting man in the world.  
                    But I d be the proudest, if I had 
                    you by my side.  

      He looks to Carrie for an answer, but she s silent, doesn t 
      know how to respond.



      Christopher runs in to find Henny, perched on a stool.  She s 
      scared out of her wits. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Henny, what s wrong?!

      She points to a TINY MOUSE huddled in the corner.  
      Christopher shakes his head, scoops up the scared mouse.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:5757

                                    CHRISTOPHER (CONT D)
                    It s harmless.  See-- it s more 
                    scared of you.

      He holds the mouse closer to her but Henny freaks out.

                                  HENNY
                    Get it away from me!  Sweet Jesus, *
                    I was gonna poison it but... OOH!

      She gestures to a BOX OF MICE POISON on the counter.  Upset, 
      Christopher grabs it.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Where d you get that?!  We don t 
                    poison mice in this house. 

      He grabs the box, heads outside with the mouse.



      Christopher gently releases the mouse into the yard.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Don t worry, little guy.  We never 
                    poison mice.

      The mouse scampers off.  Then Christopher throws the box of 
      poison into the trash can.  Inside, he notices a stack of 
      discarded NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS.   Weird.  He quickly rifles 
      through them-- they re all VIRGINIA SOCIETY PAGES FEATURING 
      CORRINE.



      Christopher exits the office.  A RECEPTIONIST approaches.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    Dr. Sheffield, about those old 
                    hospital records you requested last 
                    month? 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Oh, yes?

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    I ve called every hospital and 
                    clinic in Virginia.  But there *
                    weren t any listed under the name 
                    you gave-- not in the past eleven *
                    years.   *

      Christopher looks disturbed by this.*

                                  RECEPTIONIST (CONT D)*
                    I could try West Virginia or *
                      Maryland--*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                          (shakes it off)*
                    Don t worry about it.  It s no big *

      A gracious home.  Well-heeled SOCIETY-TYPES enter the festive 
      cocktail party.  Cathy approaches, somewhat (but not 
      comically) concealed in a long coat and scarf.  A UNIFORMED 
      COAT CHECK greets her at the front door.

                                  COAT CHECK 
                    Welcome to the Hollingers.  May I 
                    take your coat? 

                                  CATHY
                    Oh, that s alright.  I m only 
                    stopping by for a minute.  

      Cathy peers in, gazing at the BEAUTIFUL PARTY-GOERS, 
      UNIFORMED WAITERS, free-flowing CHAMPAGNE.  She s in awe-- 
      much like she was at the Christmas party at Foxworth Hall a 
      decade earlier.  She almost gets lost in the grandeur when 
      suddenly... 

      Corrine and Bart approach.  Cathy DUCKS behind a doorway, 
      eavesdrops.

                                    CORRINE
                    ... And the architect says he can 
                    restore all the original woodwork 
                    in the library--

                                  BART
                    Can we please spend one evening not 
                    talking about Foxworth Hall?

      Corrine freezes, stares at him.  Then softens.

                                    CORRINE
                    You re right.  I ve been so caught 
                    up in my own project... I ve been 
                      completely neglecting you.

                                  BART
                          (taken aback)
                    It s okay, Corrine-- 

                                    CORRINE
                          (laying it on thick)
                    No, it s not.  
                                  (MORE)

                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:7676
                                    CORRINE (CONT'D)
                    I want to hear about you.  Tell me 
                    about your work... that client 
                    you ve been working with so much... 
                    from South Carolina?

                                  BART
                            (uncomfortable)
                    You know I can t talk about my 
                    clients.

      Sensing his distance, Corrine goes in for the kill.  She 
      presses him against the doorway, within a few feet of Cathy 
      on the other side.

                                    CORRINE
                    Darling, don t you know how much I 
                    love you?  I d be lost without you.  *
                    Please say you ll forgive me... 
                    that you love me, too. 

                                  BART
                    Of course I love you.

      Corrine leans in closer.  Runs her fingers through the back 
      of his hair, her lips brushing lightly against his ear.  Bart 
      starts to melt.

                                    CORRINE
                    Promise that you ll never leave me.

                                  BART
                    I never will.

      They kiss.  On the other side of the doorway, Cathy chokes *
      back a sob.  She knows Bart really means it.



      The estate is undergoing a major remodel-- covered in 
        scaffolding, tarps, etc...  Cathy approaches gingerly, 
      looking around-- but nobody s there.  She pulls out an old 
      wooden key-- the same key Christopher made ten years earlier. 

      A few tries and the door UNLOCKS.  Cathy takes a deep breath 
      then enters to find...



      Cathy s heading out when she hears someone calling from a 
      nearby bedroom.  

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Martha, is that you--?! 

      Cathy freezes.  It s her grandmother!  

                                    GRANDMOTHER (WOMAN) (O.S.)
                    Martha, hurry up and fasten my 
                    gown!  Mr. Foxworth and I are 
                    expecting guests! 


      The estate, now fully restored, is being prepped for the big *
      Christmas party.  Under Corrine s watchful gaze, SERVANTS *
      hang decorations, polish silver, stack champagne glasses, *
      etc....  *



      As the estate is subsumed in flames, Cathy collapses into 
      Christopher s arms.  This time, there are no survivors.



      An idyllic family home with white picket fence.  Several 
      FAMILIES gather for a BBQ, with hamburgers, beer, red-
      checkered tablecloths and general horse-play.  

                                  WIFE #1
                    ...So I told Ed, if I have to host 
                    your entire family for Thanksgiving 
                    again, my mother s staying for 
                    Christmas and New Year s. 

                                  WIFE #2
                    Don t get me started on my in-laws.

      Suddenly, ADORABLE BLONDE TWINS (a boy and girl, aged 7) run 
      past with their father-- Christopher (now 30s).  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Cory, Cory-- go long! 

      The little boy, CORY, runs and CATCHES the football.  His 
      sister tackles him.

                                  CORY
                    No fair!  Carrie tackled me.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Well, then I guess I m going to 
                    have to... TICKLE BOTH OF YOU!  

      He runs over and starts tickling the kids.  They re having a 
      blast.  Cathy appears in the doorway.  She wears an apron 
      over her casual jeans and shirt, holds up a fresh-baked pie.  





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:9999

                                  CATHY
                    I hate to break up the party but 
                    dessert s ready!  Your dad s 
                      favorite-- homemade apple pie. 

      Christopher and the kids bound over.   

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    That looks wonderful, honey.

                                    CORY/CARRIE
                    Sure does, mom./Mmm, my favorite! 

      She grins, kisses them all.

                                  WIFE #1
                    What s your secret, anyway?  You 
                      Dollangangers are always so... 
                    perfect.

      Cathy smiles, but with a hint of shame, regret in her eyes.

                                  CATHY
                    No.  Not always.
