The Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese
village.
It's shadowed by a Jeep in front, and in back, each
carrying personnel armed with AK's and a few RPG's...
And in
the third Jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening
Lebanese soldiers.
And as the speeding convoy passes a
captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with
Arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are
the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Hezbollah
religious leader, the Sheikh Fadlallah...
And, suddenly the
convoy skids to a stop...
And blindfolded Lowell and Norman
are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the
cloud of dust without sight...
The lanky cameraman is
stopped, told to wait, while Lowell is pushed past armed men
guarding a small stone house, and inside...
She opens Jeffrey's car looking in the front seat at the cup
holders.
She turns to leave and sees the backseat filled
with two boxes and the books we saw him take...
LIANE
Uh, what are those boxes?
WIGAND
I'm going to the store.
You need
anything?
LIANE
What do you need at the store?
WIGAND
Soy sauce...
LIANE
Right now?
WIGAND
(meaning in the car)
That's my stuff from the office...
LIANE
Why did you take your stuff from the
office?
WIGAND
(simply)
I didn't want to leave it there...
LIANE
(confused)
I don't understand.
WIGAND
(matter of fact)
I got fired this morning...
Where else
am I gonna take it?
LIANE
Why?
Who said?
WIGAND
(specifically)
Thomas Sandefur...
LIANE
(stunned, fearful)
What are we supposed to do...?
What
about our medical coverage; what about
our health?
What about our car payments?
The payments on this house?
He looks at her.
There's an unspoken moment when it seems
he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling...
But she
doesn't and now there's a wall up and the moment passes...
WIGAND
(a beat, specific)
There's a severance agreement...
It
includes cash payouts over time and
continuing medical coverage...
(beat)
Sure you don't need anything?
LIANE
No, thank you.
She's stunned.
He leaves.
And as Liane's completely still,
her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she
wants to ask how he is, how he must be feeling, and she turns
into CAMERA towards him to do that.
But he's driven off down
the street.
LIANE (cont'd)
Jeffrey...!
It's still.
A MAIL TRUCK is stopped at an odd angle in the
street outside an older brick house with a bold redwood Big
Sur-like fence on a hillside.
Beyond the truck is a forever
view of the Bay.
A handle turns.
Mail truck door opens.
Mailman, carrying a box, going through the gate.
Doorstep.
Box is deposited there.
It's quiet again.
The BOX sitting
nakedly by the front door...
The Boys coming out of the house together...
And seeing the
BOX by the door...
LOWELL'S SON
(shouts back inside)
Dad, you got a box out here...
And they go out the gate, talking, walking off along the
Berkeley street.
The box left waiting by the door.
LOWELL
(looking at her itinerary)
Let me see this...
No, 'cause I gotta
know where you're going at all times.
PAY PHONE
There's the sound of a phone ringing.
PULL BACK to reveal
Lowell outside a cafe with dry cleaning he collected over one
shoulder.
A LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE OVER (Deborah's) answers.
"Hello."
LOWELL
Mr. Wigand, please.
There's a whisper..."Someone's calling for Daddy, Mom."
Behind Lowell is a humming Berkeley street.
He gestures
familiarly to a Server, who brings out his two take-out
cappuccinos.
Lowell nods his thanks, pays...
LOWELL (cont'd)
Thank you, Bob.
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
Who's calling?
LOWELL
My name's Lowell Bergman...
I'm --
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
Did you say Berman?
LOWELL
No, Bergman...B.E.R.G.M.A.N....
I'm a
producer with "60 Minutes"...
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
"60 Minutes"?
LOWELL
Yeah.
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
"60 Minutes," the television show?
LOWELL
Yes.
Lowell waits for some moments, and...
LOWELL
How does he know he doesn't want to talk
to me?
He doesn't know what I'm calling
him about...
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
He doesn't care to know.
And she hangs up.
Lowell's motionless...
And his interest
piqued, he sets down his cleaning.
He calls back...
The
phone rings and rings...
A MACHINE picks it up...
Jeffrey
Wigand's Voice:
"This is the Wigands'...
If you'd like to
leave a message or send a fax, start now..."
There's a blast of NOISE.
The City.
Lowell, Wallace,
Hewitt, Debbie, enter from the CBS lobby, moving through the
reflections.
Lowell is about to say something to Debbie, but
BILL FELLING, Evening News' Assignment Editor, coming the
other way...
LOWELL
Debbie...
FELLING
Hey, Lowell.
Midstream, fast:
LOWELL
Oh, Bill...
Main Justice is
investigating a major New York bank.
Laundering narco dollars out of their
Mexico City branch.
You want it for the
Evening News?
FELLING
What about you, you got a crew already?
LOWELL
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
FELLING
Okay.
(leaves)
LOWELL
Catch ya' later.
Lowell, crossing...
LOWELL
Debbie...
And, now, as they cross Madison...
LOWELL (CONT'D)
(to Debbie; finally)
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS.
Boundaries
of their constraint.
Kentucky state law
about.
I want you to drop everything.
DEBBIE DELUCA
(cuts in)
Okay.
Hewitt stops to buy a newspaper.
He doesn't have change,
Debbie does.
And Mike, Lowell and Don bang into Michael's restaurant.
We
SEE them through the glass, being greeted, people shaking
their hands, escorted by the maitre d' to their table as...
Wigand picks up the phone and dials.
WIGAND
(crazed)
...protect your sources...!
You screwed
me!
You sold me out!
WIGAND
Fuck you, too!
And he slams down the phone.
We see a brightly lit, golf driving range, empty, the wet
grass under the lights vibrant, emerald green...
A caged
cart, with one big yellow headlight, like some kind of
strange insect, drives across the range, picking up golf
balls.
And we see Jeffrey hitting golf balls, driving one
after another, after another...
His swing is powerful,
angry, a lone golfer, trying to chill out.
He pauses, spent.
Settling down, he exhales.
Then, he looks down the way...
And he slows...
He sees in the far distance, spot-lit, one
other lone golfer, a Stocky Man, incongruously in a suit and
tie, watching him...
And the Man in the suit right then,
with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a
golf ball...
The ball slamming into the steel net.
And the
lights SUDDENLY go out.
The range closing for the night.
The "insect" comes to a stop.
And it's quiet, dark.
Jeffrey
gathers up his clubs.
He crosses, his golf shoes, the metal
cleats, clicking on the pavement, toward the PARKING LOT.
And there's the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind
him.
He turns.
And the stocky Man in the suit, carrying a
golf bag walking some distance behind him, staring at him.
Jeffrey comes to the parking lot.
It's empty.
Just
Jeffrey's car, and despite all the empty spaces, another car,
purposely or otherwise, parked right next to his.
He crosses
to his car, getting in...
Golf club in hand at the driver side window...
WIGAND
(motioning with the club,
threatening)
Stay away from me!
You stay away from
me!
The Man starts his car, and drives off nonplussed.
It's
still.
And as Jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty
parking lot, not knowing what's threatening him, something
real, something imaginary...
HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
A violent rain's falling.
And we see Jeffrey coming out of
the house holding an umbrella over his little Girls.
They
start towards the car.
There's the sound of a car door
shutting.
Liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them...
LIANE
Jeffrey, you forgot their lunches --
She slows, seeing someone.
Jeffrey turns:
it's Lowell.
He's surprised.
LOWELL
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
WIGAND
(to the girls, protectively)
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
LOWELL
I'm Lowell Bergman.
We spoke on the
phone, remember?
The Girls climb in the car.
Lowell crosses behind the Audi
around the far side.
LOWELL (CONT'D)
C'mere.
I want to talk to you.
WIGAND
Good.
I want to talk to you.
Jeff closes the door on his daughters and joins Lowell around
the far side of the car.
WIGAND (CONT'D)
(confronting him)
What do...
LOWELL
(running over)
I did not burn you.
I did not give you
up to anyone!
WIGAND
(continuing)
This is my house...
In front of my wife,
my kids?!
What business do we have?
LOWELL
To straighten something out with you.
Right here.
Right now.
WIGAND
So, you didn't mention my name?
You
haven't talked to anybody about me?
LOWELL
Why am I gonna mention your name?
WIGAND
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke
to you...?
LOWELL
How the hell do I know about Brown &
Williamson?
WIGAND
It happened after I talked to you.
I do
not like coincidences!
LOWELL
And I don't like paranoid accusations!
I'm a journalist.
Think.
Use your head.
How do I operate as a journalist by
screwing the people who could provide me
with information before they provided me
with it?
WIGAND
(skeptical)
You came all the way down here to tell me
that?
LOWELL
No.
I did not.
Big Tobacco is a big
story.
And you got something important
to say.
I can tell.
(a beat, personal)
But, yes.
I did.
I came all the way down here to tell you:
story, no story, fuck your story, I don't
burn people.
It starts to rain harder.
They look at each other.
Jeffrey,
without saying a word, gets in the Car.
He backs out.
Lowell, left standing in the driveway with Liane in the rain.
Liane goes back into the house.
And Lowell starts back
across the street to his car.
There's a sound.
He turns.
Jeffrey's car, having gone around the corner, has come back
and stopped in the street.
WIGAND
(after a beat)
Ride with me while I take the girls to
school...
Lowell hesitates, then gets into the car in the back seat.
- MORNING
We see the Car's parked in a weed-strewn empty lot.
Rain,
pounding on it and the surface of the river beyond...
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
...and my little girl has acute asthma...
Deborah.
My eldest daughter.
Jeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in
the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small
tomato trellises.
We see the house, now.
It's a small, one
story.
Deborah sees her mom and waves.
It's an image from
the 1950's post-war boom.
Liane waves back from behind the
pane of glass...
It's still.
He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark
shrubs and small tree in the corner.
Meanwhile, Jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back
corners.
Sudden rustling.
He spins, gun ready.
And the
yellow eyes of a RACCOON stare at him.
WIGAND
(to himself)
You almost got your damn head blown
off...
The raccoon defiantly bares its teeth.
Jeffrey starts to go...but he sees something and stops...
Meanwhile, Barbara has come to the sliding glass door...
Jeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed, stepped
on...and in the vegetable garden's earth, are distinct,
fresh, deep FOOTPRINTS...
BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER)
Daddy...
Wigand steps between her and the garden, hiding it...
EXTREMELY CLOSE ON JEFFREY, as he covers, trying to keep from
his daughter the invasion, trying to control his emotions...
WIGAND
(reassuring her)
It's just a raccoon, baby...nothing.
He crosses to her, putting his arm, around her, walking her
back inside...
WIGAND (CONT'D)
They're nocturnal.
You know what that
means?
That means that they only come
out at nighttime.
He locks the sliding glass door, takes a last look outside.
Jeffrey, having arrived home from work, pulls the mail out of
the mailbox, now stands, frozen, staring at something...
And
he sees, standing upright in the back of the mail box, like a
monument of threat, a single hollow point .38 CALIBER BULLET.
He freezes...
And simultaneously...
Liane and the Girls are running toward him...like in a bad
fucking dream.
He's looking at them.
Liane is saying
something about E-mail, but his slow-motion attention is
still arrested by the statuesque bullet.
As they close on
him...
And we see Lowell lit by FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS.
We're at a
crime scene.
Uniformed cops on horseback.
Just arrived, the
Cameraman's unloading his gear, preparing to shoot B-roll.
LOWELL
What happened?
COP
Dispatch received a call of shots fired
in the area.
Uniforms arrived on the
scene and found this white male subject
shot to death.
LOWELL
Was it gang related?
COP
There's no indication as far as a tag or
an advertisement...
Police moving around as Lowell's cell phone RINGS...
LOWELL
(answering)
Excuse me.
Yeah...
WIGAND
(outraged)
You can't take that...
It's personal
property...!
FBI AGENT #2 (OR #3)
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand.
There's been a death threat.
WIGAND
(after him)
...my files!
Personal correspondence...
Agent #3 ignores him, putting the computer in the trunk of
their car.
And FBI Agent #1, the .38 bullet in a baggie,
comes out of the house.
WIGAND (CONT'D)
...letters to my brother...my will.
His shoes slip on the grass and he falls.
And the FBI are
getting into their car.
And NEIGHBORS have come out,
watching them.
Liane and the girls, standing halfway down
the front lawn, the neighbors looking at them.
She and
Jeffrey look at each other.
Will she go to him or not?
She
goes to him as he rises...
WIGAND (cont'd)
That computer has everything...
FBI AGENT #2
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
FBI AGENT #1
We need to take a look at your gun safe,
Mr. Wigand.
LOWELL
(interrupts)
I'm telling you, your agents in that
office are acting improperly!
Now, who
are they trying to protect?
And we see a Man in his early forties, a neatly-dressed man
who prides himself on his appearance, at his desk in the
Bureau (FBI).
BILL ROBERTSON.
He's completely distracted,
focused on agent travel orders...
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)
Let me tell you something, Lowell.
Look,
look, look.
You're talking about two
agents in a regional office in
Louisville.
I got the goddamn Unabomber
threatening to blow up LAX!
I gotta move
45 agents from all over the country into
L.A.
Alright?
When I get a chance, I'll
give it a look...
LOWELL
(heated)
You better take a good look!
Because I'm
getting two things:
pissed off and
curious!
Now, any of these guys been
offered jobs in corporate security after
they retire?
Either one of those guys
have ex-agent pals already in those jobs?
Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor,
who's already at Brown & Williamson as we
fucking speak?
Jeffrey drives up the block and onto his driveway.
Seeing a
MAN in a suit, an ear piece in his ear, disappearing around
the corner of his house, Jeffrey leaps out of the car.
But
the front door's open.
So instead of chasing after, he runs
inside...
The house on the quiet suburban street.
A Security Guard,
incongruous, a noticeable bulge where his shoulder holster
is, sitting watch under the porch light on the small front
porch in a metal porch chair.
A white, traditional, Southern house, with a veranda and
gables...a large front lawn with weeping willows.
And we see
Lowell, hands in his pockets, not an insider or an outsider,
waiting alone on the expansive lawn.
The front door opens.
A Mississippi State Trooper, putting on his round brimmed hat
comes out and crosses the driveway.
Then Jeffrey coming out
with Motley.
Motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment
and then heads towards his car.
Meanwhile, Jeffrey comes
down over to Lowell on the lawn.
And Jeffrey looks off, across the street from the house, at
the Gulf.
And we see the street is blockaded by Mississippi
State Police cars.
An armed camp.
Other men in suits,
Lawyers and state officials, wait.
Ron Motley gets in his
car and drives away.
LOWELL
You attract a crowd.
WIGAND
(smiles, wry)
Yeah, great.
LOWELL
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
WIGAND
I don't know what to do.
And they're quiet, a breeze of the Gulf ruffling their
coats...
He looks out at the water, a cargo container ship
passing by.
He watches its slow progress...
And Jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands
in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking...
And
Richard Scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside
Lowell...
DAY
Motley's car parks, and he and an Assistant are approached by
a flurry of media from the parking lot behind us, crossing
Canty Street to intercept him.
And we SEE the lot is jammed
with Mercedes-Benzes, Town Cars and limousines belonging to
the 150-200 Big Tobacco, Wall Street lawyers.
Some hang out
by their cars, killing time.
It's a tailgate party.
Beyond
them are trucks and vans with satellite dishes supporting the
media circus.
They're all here for Jeff's deposition.
The
scale of it dwarfs the plebeian storefront with its sign
"Temporary Jackson County Courthouse"...into which Motley
enters...
Jeffrey contemplating.
Jeffrey alone on the jetty, looking out to sea.
Trying to
decide, trying to untangle identity and consequence.
A
moment.
He turns, crossing to Lowell and Scruggs.
Then.
it's the three men, standing on the lawn.
Time seems to
slow...all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally
and historically...
WIGAND
(severely conflicted)
I can't seem to find...the criteria to
decide.
It's too big a decision to make
without being resolved...in my own mind.
They're quiet.
Jeffrey, getting nowhere.
Lowell offers...
LOWELL
Maybe things have changed...
Long pause on Jeffrey as he contemplates his future.
And
something just got resolved.
He asks Lowell, rhetorically...
WIGAND
What's changed?
LOWELL
(unsure)
You mean...since this morning?
WIGAND
No.
I mean since whenever...
Nothing's changed.
Wigand looks at them.
He found his own
answer.
WIGAND (CONT'D)
Fuck it.
Let's go to court.
And Dick Scruggs and Lowell look at this normal, somewhat
flawed, very courageous man...
RICHARD SCRUGGS
(to unseen staff)
Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.
And there's a sudden flurry of activity.
Jeffrey and Scruggs
walk to a Mississippi State Police car.
Lowell gets into his
car and drives away, separately.
Police, State Officials,
run to their cars.
Cars starting, lights flashing, Wigand's
car pulls into position.
Some of the Tobacco Lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging
across Canty Street by their cars.
And now they see the
police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards
the courthouse.
The caravan stops.
First, Scruggs gets out.
A moment, then Jeffrey appears.
And the Reporters pounce on
Jeffrey, cameras flashing...Mississippi Police leading him
through the crowd...
Moore appears at courtroom door
(already there).
And as he's whisked away into the
courtroom.
Lowell, waiting with the other journalists...
PHOTOGRAPHER
Got any idea what's going on in there?
LOWELL
No, I don't have a clue.
Lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain.
There's
a slight sound.
He turns.
And Jeffrey's come outside.
He
stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain
and windswept trees.
They're quiet.
They share a look.
They nod to each other.
The smallest nod of accomplishment.
And they're there on the porch, alone, outside the house in
Pascagoula, Mississippi.
We see an anonymous rental car moving through downtown
Louisville.
The car's stopped at the curb.
Jeffrey gets out.
He starts
up the walk, and the Second Security Guard quickly crosses
the lawn to intercept him...
And Jeff opens the door going inside, anxious to be home...
We see Sharon in a vegetable garden in their side yard...
She turns, seeing him standing behind her...
After a moment.
She knows.
SHARON
What's wrong?
LOWELL
They're killing the Wigand interview...
SHARON
What?!
LOWELL
They're pretending it's process.
Bullshit, it's foregone.
SHARON
(beat)
What are you and Mike going to do?
LOWELL
I'm alone on this...
SHARON
(beat)
Oh, baby...
And the phone RINGS...
Sharon goes in the house to get it...
She comes back out...
SHARON (CONT'D)
(after a beat)
Jeffrey Wigand...
A peaceful, suburban street.
Small houses.
A PRIVATE
INVESTIGATOR (P.I.) from IGI, in a raincoat, getting out of a
car, going up the walk.
He knocks on the door.
Some
moments.
A Woman in her late forties, handicapped, in an
electric cart answers the door...
P.I.
Mrs. Wigand?
THE WOMAN
It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand for some time.
P.I.
Well, I'm an investigator and I was - I
was wondering if I could ask you a couple
of questions about that?
THE WOMAN
Alright...
ON the door to the roof.
It SLAMS open.
An enraged Lowell
enters and walks out into the cold rain.
Like a prize-
fighter, shoulders hunched against the cold, he buries his
hands in his jacket pockets.
He crosses to the edge of the
roof high above the city.
He's pissed off.
He takes out his
cell phone.
He dials...
Lowell hears background NOISE...
A Range Rover pulls up.
Charlie Phillips gets out.
He
crosses to Lowell who's been waiting by his own taxi.
LOWELL
Here.
He hands Charlie a folder with the brown notebook inside that
is the partially complete Palladino/Sutherland/Lowell work
product.
LOWELL (CONT'D)
These are their leads, their sources.
I
want you to have your reporters...
CHARLIE PHILLIPS
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
LOWELL
Have them make their own calls.
They'll
find that these sources have a different
story than the one that's in the
dossier...
(demands)
Push the deadline, Charlie...
Charlie starts looking through the Palladino/
Sutherland/Lowell work product.
Meanwhile...
CHARLIE PHILLIPS
I'll push it for a week.
Let Milo and
Suein go through it.
Lowell, walking up the sand, his cell phone rings.
LOWELL
Yeah.
MIKE WALLACE
You disappeared on me.
How long you
staying?
LOWELL
(absurd)
I disappeared on you?
MIKE WALLACE
(meaning the show)
Alright.
What did you think?
LOWELL
(after a beat)
I think it was a disgrace.
The look on Wallace's face says he thinks so, too.
It's
obvious.
He hangs up the phone.
Lowell is on the phone, now.
The moon lights the water, the
empty beach.
He listens as a phone, through STATIC, RINGS
and RINGS and RINGS.
AN OPERATOR'S VOICE (OVER)
Sir, there's still no answer in that
room.
LOWELL
Alright.
Get me the manager's office...
Lowell, standing on the beach anxiously waiting.
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
(upset)
I think I need to call the police.
He
won't respond...
LOWELL
No, no.
Don't call the police!
(urgent)
Just tell him I'm on the phone with
you...
My name is Lowell Bergman...
Just tell him that.
LOWELL
Did he hear you?
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.
Lowell goes deeper into the water.
LOWELL
What about now?
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
What?
LOWELL
Hello, can you hear me now?
Lowell anxiously moves along the beach, trying to be heard,
the phone chattering with static...
LOWELL
(alarmed)
What's happening?!
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
(afraid)
He doesn't seem to be listening...
LOWELL
(on the cell phone, shouts,
urgent)
Alright, now listen to me.
I want you -
I want you to tell him, in these words:
get on the fucking phone...!
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
I can't say that!
LOWELL
No, you can.
Tell him to get on the
fucking phone!
Between two curved colonnades of SNOW-covered trees drives a
rental car.
CLOSER, it's Lowell.
His POV spots a dirty SUV
and he pulls into park across from a coffee shop in this out-
of-context mountain town.
His pager beeps.
He looks at it.
He detours from the coffee shop to a pay phone on the corner
of the Moose Lodge.
DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER)
I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone...
LOWELL
Patch him through.
RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER)
Well, Lowell, you are not going to
believe this...
RICHARD SCRUGGS
What chance is there of getting Jeff's
interview on the air...?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
(droll)
Less than great.
And the courthouse doors suddenly burst open, Michael Moore
and his attorneys coming out.
Scruggs comes further down the
steps so he can hear, away from Michael Moore who begins
answering questions from the Press.
RICHARD SCRUGGS
(after a beat)
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell
you how important it was in the court of
public opinion...
LOWELL
(a beat)
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't
tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
RICHARD SCRUGGS
All right.
See you...
And we see Lowell on the PAY PHONE again.
LOWELL
Just ran into two of your "geologists."
Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed
up...?
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)
Lowell?
LOWELL
So, I'll hold it...
And...
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)
(on the phone)
We'll give you a heads up before we
launch.
LOWELL
How long?
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)
Three hours.
LOWELL
You got a deal.
(hangs up)
Newspaper box is loaded with The New York Times.
Cab pulls to curb and a raincoated Man emerges.
We SEE he
carries a copy of this morning's New York Times.
As Lowell hails a cab in a WIDE ANGLE and runs towards us,
jumping into the cab...
