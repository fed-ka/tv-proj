      INT. AIRPORT BATHROOM -- DAY

      ELIZA DOOLEY, late 20 s, gazes at her reflection in the 
      mirror, phone in hand, poised for a selfie. Her expression 
      indicates she s pleased with what she sees.  In fact, Eliza 
      finds herself sexy as fuck.    

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    The funny part is, in Junior High? 
                    I was voted  Most Fuggs.  


      ELIZA S INSTAGRAM FEED -- THROWBACK THURSDAY

      We see a highly unflattering Junior High yearbook photo of 
      YOUNG ELIZA featuring the unholy trinity of denim vest, 
      overbite, unibrow.  The hashtags #TBT #MOSTFUGGS #FUGLY tell 
      us that Eliza s awkward phase was brutal.  We PUSH IN on the 
      photo and DISSOLVE TO--


      INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM -- (FLASHBACK)

      YOUNG ELIZA, dressed for the school dance, rapidly works a 
      PED-EGG across her face resulting in a bright red, but 
      entirely hairless, upper lip.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    I d come a long way from the 
                    seventh grade girl who ped-egg d 
                    off her mustache during a school 
                    dance...

      A PRETTY GIRL enters then stops short, alarmed.

                                  PRETTY GIRL
                    What are you doing in the girls 
                    bathroom?


      INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL -- PRESENT

      Eliza bursts from the bathroom confidently as her PHONE 
      EXPLODES WITH LIKES from her latest selfie. 

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    Nowadays?  There was no question 
                    which bathroom I belonged in.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Thanks to the magic of laser hair 
                    removal, push-up bras and filters 
                    on photos-- I was Instafamous.  And 
                    even though that came with its own 
                      Instadrama, it was worth it.  I had 
                    143,000 friends, followers and 
                        Insta-acquaintances.  Which meant I 
                    was never alone.

      Eliza climbs into a WHEELCHAIR strewn with luggage and 
      shopping bags.  An AIRLINE ATTENDANT pushes Eliza towards her 
      gate.  Eliza crosses her legs revealing five-inch Louboutin 
      spiked slouchy booties.

                                  ELIZA
                    These are kind of a disability, 
                    right?
                          (then)
                    I m tweeting that.  Don t you.

                                    AIRLINE ATTENDANT
                    I won t.

      Eliza smiles as she sends her tweet.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    I had it all.  The latest  it  
                    boots.  Assistance to my gate.  The 
                    love and respect of my co-workers-- 

      ANGLE ON: LINDA, DENISE and CHER, three of Eliza s co-workers 
      who clearly hate her guts, wait in line for coffee as Eliza 
      is wheeled past them.

                                  ELIZA
                    Priority check-in!  What?  See you 
                    sluts on board!  
                          (points at one)
                    Don t be jelly, Linda!

      Eliza rapidly clicks away on her phone.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    I even had a budding workplace 
                    romance on the DL...

      ON ELIZA S PHONE-- she updates her Facebook status to 
       Budding Workplace Romance on the DL.   WE PULL BACK to find 
      she is now--                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-143.


      INT. AIRPLANE -- CONTINUOUS

      Eliza climbs out of her wheelchair and plows down the aisle.  
      Still on her phone, she obliviously hits every single 
      passenger in the head with her GIANT OVERSIZED PURSE.  HENRY 
        HIGENBOTTAM, late 30 s early 40 s, British, self-assured, 
      enjoys a scotch in the first-class cabin and eyes Eliza.

                                  HENRY
                    That one of ours?

      Henry s coworker, ETHAN CHASE, 30, smirks.

                                  ETHAN
                    You ve been at the company six 
                    months and you haven t noticed 
                    Eliza Dooley?  Yeah.  That s one of 
                    ours.  She works in sales.

                                  HENRY
                          (off wheelchair)
                    Is she handicapped?

                                  ETHAN
                    By her self-obsession.  But 
                      bolstered, I would say, by her 
                    ability to wear the shit out of a 
                    pencil skirt.  To be honest, it s 
                    what s kept her at the company this 
                    long.

                                  HENRY
                    The pencil skirt?

                                  ETHAN
                    And what s in it.  Let s just say 
                    she s had several above her pay-
                    grade hook-ups the most recent of 
                    which happened during this sales 
                      conference with Miller, from legal, 
                    who happens to be--

                                  HENRY
                    Married, isn t he?

                                  ETHAN
                    Eliza hasn t picked up on that yet.  
                    She s too busy making sure her 
                    lipstick matches her thong.

                                  HENRY
                    How do you know so much about her 
                    lipstick and her thong?                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-144.


                                  ETHAN
                            (unapologetically)
                    I follow her on Instagram.

      Ethan hands Henry his phone.  Henry swipes through a series 
      of Eliza s photos, shaking his head in disgust.

                                  HENRY 
                    Is that her breakfast?  Why do you 
                    Americans feel compelled to  tweet  
                    every item that goes into your 
                    mouths, including this man s--

                                  STEWARDESS (O.S.)
                    Warm nuts?


      INT. AIRPLANE -- A FEW ROWS BACK-- CONTINUOUS

      MILLER LORDE, 30 s, happily accepts the dish of nuts from the 
      STEWARDESS.  Eliza slides into the empty seat next to him.

                                  ELIZA
                    Bet you thought you could escape me 
                    in First Class, but nope.  I got 
                    the upgrade.  In fact, we both did.

      Eliza leans in for a kiss.

                                  MILLER
                    Eliza, wait--

                                  ELIZA
                    Look, I know it s intimidating to 
                    fall for a girl with a strong 
                    pelvic floor and an advertising 
                    presence on her Facebook page--

                                  MILLER
                    It s not that.

                                  ELIZA
                    Then what?

      Another stewardess, CAROL-JUNE, 40 s, appears in the aisle.

                                  CAROL-JUNE
                    Devices off?  Seat-belts buckled?

      IN SLOW MOTION-- Miller reaches down to buckle up. Eliza 
      GASPS noticing the telltale tan-line on his ring finger.                          #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-145.


                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    If my phone hadn t been on airplane-
                    mode, I seriously might have missed 
                    it...

                                  MILLER
                    Eliza?  Are you okay?  

      QUICK POP: we see a series of GIFs depicting the various 
      emotions Eliza feels as she processes this news.  

                                    CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                    Ladies and gentleman we re 
                      experiencing some choppy air but 
                    things should smooth out when we 
                    reach our cruising altitude.

      Eliza looks a little nauseous as the plane sways.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    Nausea.  Dizziness.  A legit case 
                    of ham tongue.  It was either the 
                      turbulence or grinder s remorse or 
                    a rare combination of the--

      ELIZA grabs the airsickness bag and WRETCHES filling it to 
      the brim.  

                                  MILLER
                    Wow!  That was-- are you okay?

                                  ELIZA
                    Married?  You re married!  Why does 
                    this crap always happen to me?  
                    It s sickening!

      Eliza grabs the other airsickness bag and in one LURCH fills 
      that too.  Miller inches back in his seat, alarmed. 

                                  MILLER
                    So, hey.  Maybe you should head to 
                    the bathroom?

      Eliza glares at Miller and stands, wobbly in her Louboutins, 
      and juggling the two very full bags of vomit.  As Eliza makes 
      her way into the aisle the bottom of the bags give out, 
      dousing her in bile. WE FREEZE ON THIS IMAGE. 

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                      I couldn t tell what sucked more: 
                    being drenched in panic pudding at 
                      a cruising altitude of 32,000 feet?  
                    Or how many people  liked  seeing 
                    me that way.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-146.


      The image becomes plastered with SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS as it is

      INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      Eliza stands in the cramped bathroom in her bra and 
      underwear.  She whimpers as she catches a glimpse of herself 
      in the mirror and presses the CALL BUTTON for help.

                                  CAROL-JUNE (O.S.)
                      Everything okay in there?

      Eliza opens the door a crack. 

                                  ELIZA
                    Not really.  My new boyfriend is 
                    someone else s husband, I barfed 
                    all over my Louboutins, the plane 
                    is full of my coworkers and now I m 
                    stranded in here, naked and afraid. 

      The fasten seat-belt sign DINGS.  

                                  CAROL-JUNE
                    Ma am, I m going to need you to 
                    vacate the lav--

                                  ELIZA
                    Did you not--

                                  CAROL-JUNE
                    The captain has illuminated the 
                    seat-belt sign--

                                  ELIZA
                    Oh, he s illuminated it?!  Do you 
                    think he d like me to  illuminate  
                    my butt cheeks to the entire First 
                    Class cabin? 

      Carol-June speaks into a little microphone, clipped to her 
      lapel.

                                  CAROL-JUNE
                    Co-Pilot Ron?  Would you ask Air 
                    Marshall Cliff to come out here--

                                  ELIZA
                    Okay, no.  No.  We are not dragging 
                    Air Marshall Cliff into this!

                                  ELIZA (CONT'D)
                    I ll  vacate your lav  but can you 
                    at least grab me an extra 
                      stewardess outfit? I probably 
                    wouldn t do the little hat or the 
                    neck scarf but the skirt, yes, and 
                    the button-down, certainly, and why 
                    not, sure, the vest.

      Eliza fights the urge to dry heave.

                                  CAROL-JUNE
                    Ma am, this is not a department 
                    store, there are no extra outfits-- 

      Eliza opens the door wider to fully reveal her predicament.  

                                  ELIZA
                      Carol-June, straight up!  What 
                    would you do if you were me?


      INT. AIRPLANE -- CONTINUOUS

      Eliza, wearing sunglasses and THREE IN-FLIGHT BLANKETS 
      wrapped around her body sarong-style, tries to look confident 
      as she heads back down the aisle towards her seat.  Her 
      COWORKERS snicker with delight and document her walk of shame 
      on their phones.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)  
                    I think I was having what Oprah 
                    referred to as an  aha  moment.

      Eliza quickly clutches the blanket which has started to slide 
      open.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    Only instead of saying  aha  I d 
                      inadvertently flashed my balloon 
                    knot to the sales and marketing 
                    division.

                          (off Eliza s ass) 
                    If that s the face of the future,  
                    we re screwed.

                                            ACT ONE


      INT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- LOBBY -- LATER

      Eliza, still dressed in blankets, runs across the lobby of 
      her apartment building trying to catch the elevator as its 
      doors close.

                                  ELIZA
                    Hold the elevator!

      A HAND adorned with PUFFY CLOUD NAIL ART shoots out of the 
      elevator and pushes the doors open for Eliza.  


      INT. ELEVATOR-- CONTINUOUS

      The hand belongs to BRYN, 30, Eliza s adorable neighbor, a 
      hipster girl s girl. Bryn is surrounded by WREN, PRUE, 
      THISTLE and EYELET her BOOK CLUB. Eliza slinks in and 
      retreats to a corner of the elevator.

                                  ELIZA
                    Thanks.

                                  BRYN
                    I m sorry, but even if you are 
                    stuck in a passionless marriage 
                    that doesn t give you the right to 
                    commit adultery.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    Okay, you know what I wasn t in the 
                    mood for?  A lecture from my holier-
                    than-thou neighbor  Bookclub Bryn.   
                    She s the worst...  

      QUICK POP: we scroll through BRYN S INSTAGRAM FEED as Eliza 
      describes her.

                                  ELIZA (V.O)
                    ...with her nail art and her 
                    chevron stripes and her BFFS who 
                    love to DIY and her dream-catchers 
                    and her peter-pan collar and her 
                    ukulele and her non-prescription 
                      prescription glasses and her 
                    hipster friends with names like 
                    Wren, Prue, Thistle and Eyelet and 
                    their top-knots and cross-body 
                    bags.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-149.


                                  EYELET
                    It s weird.  She defines herself by 
                    her sexuality but I actually think 
                    that s the least interesting thing 
                    about her.

      Eliza can take no more.

                                  ELIZA
                    Okay, first of all, I had no idea 
                    he was married when we engaged in 
                      gland-to-gland combat.  Second of 
                    all, I get super horny when I 
                    travel, that s not my fault--

      Eliza stops.  She notices the girls staring at her blankly.

                                  BRYN
                    Um, we weren t talking about you.

                                    THISTLE
                    We were discussing  Fear of 
                    Flying.  

                                  WREN
                    By Erica Jong.

                                  EYELET
                          (softly)
                    We re a book club.

      A beat.  Eliza looks embarrassed.  Then, covering:

                                  ELIZA
                    I know that, Eyelet.  God.  How 
                    stupid do you think I am?


      INT. ELIZA S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER

      Eliza lies on her couch, cocooned in a huge blanket, with a 
      mop-bucket next to her on the floor.  

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    I was humiliated, dehydrated and 
                    srsly in need of someone to hold 
                    back my hair while I dry-heaved 
                    into this industrial mop-bucket 
                    that smells like  Fabuloso. 

      The laughter of Bryn and her friends can be heard through the 
      wall.  Eliza bolts upright.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1410.


                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    Then I realized:  Bryn wasn t the 
                    only one with a social network. I  
                    literally had thousands of friends 
                    I could S.O.text for a Gingerale...  

      Eliza scrolls through the address book on her phone.  Landing 
      on FIT BRIT.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    Like Fit Brit, an illegal 
                      gymmigrant with blonde eyebrows, 
                    who I first met at a spin class she 
                    snuck into without paying. 

      ON ELIZA S PHONE as FIT BRIT s face fills the screen.  She s 
      on her back, in a hospital gown, with her feet in stirrups.

                                  ELIZA
                    Brit, I m so sick and I had the 
                    worst flight home.  Can you come 
                    over with some Gingerale? 

                                  FIT BRIT
                    Sorry, tramp.  I gotta service my 
                    cervix, hit TJ Maxx, buy an LBD, 
                    crash hot yoga, hit dem clubs and 
                    drink dat sizzurp.  Maybe we can 
                    Google hangout later.

      Eliza flops back on the couch and looks at her phone.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    I was left to my own devices. 
                      Literally.  So I used mine to order 
                    from an E-Grocer with a twenty-five 
                    dollar minimum.


      INT. BATHROOM -- LATER

      Eliza sits in a bath.  TWENTY-FIVE CANS OF GINGERALE, empty 
      and crushed like beer cans, litter the floor of her bathroom.  

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    And even though it was dope of 
                    Gevorg to come so quickly...

      QUICK POP: Eliza opens the door for GEVORG, an Armenian 
      delivery boy, holding stacks of Gingerale.

                                  ELIZA
                    When the delivery boy is the only 
                    person who s there for you? 
                                  (MORE)                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1411.

                                  ELIZA (CONT'D)
                    Kinda makes you realize: being 
                    friended is not the same thing as 
                    having friends.


      INT. ELEVATOR -- NEXT DAY

      Henry and Ethan ride the elevator up to work.

                                  ETHAN
                    So no girlfriend?

                                  HENRY
                    You already asked me that.  No.

                                  ETHAN
                    Any pets?
                          (off Henry s look)
                    What?  I m just trying to determine 
                    if it s an utter lack of personal 
                      connections that makes you so good  
                    at your job.

      The elevator doors open and three PASSENGERS get on, all 
      looking at their phones.

                                  HENRY
                    I find it rather easy not to form  
                      a personal connection in a town 
                    that only values wireless 
                      connection.   

      PAN OVER to reveal Ethan and the rest of the passengers are 
      all tilting their phones around trying to find signal.


      INT. KINDERLABS -- RECEPTION AREA -- CONTINUOUS

      THE BANK OF ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN.  Henry, Ethan and scores of 
      other EMPLOYEES spill out, flowing past the desk of 
        CHARMONIQUE, 30 s, the cheery African American receptionist.

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    Good morning, how are you?

                                  HENRY
                    Fine thanks, Charmonique!  And you?

      More EMPLOYEES trickle by.  

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    Good morning, how are you?                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1412.


                                  LINDA
                    Fine thanks and you?

      This comfortable rhythm continues on until Eliza emerges from 
      the elevator, toting her trademark GIANT PURSE.  

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    Good morning, how are you?

      Eliza rolls her eyes dramatically and throws her purse up on 
      Charmonique s desk. 

                                  ELIZA
                    Les Miserables! BF BS.  Got played 
                    like Monopoly.  Mortified.com. Then 
                    hurled, overslept, od d on the 
                    bean, contracted legit hamster 
                    breath and now I m hella late for 
                    the staff meeting. 

      Charmonique looks surprised as Eliza heads off in a hurry.

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    Well, have a nice day.


      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

      Eliza slips into the packed conference room. 

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                      I normally hate staff meetings 
                    because they re super boring and 
                    smell like cream-cheese...

      We ZIP PAN to a sad PLATTER OF BAGELS AND CREAM CHEESE.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    But today, I was just psyched to 
                    focus on something other than 
                      yesterday s drama.

      Eliza plunks down in a chair, then feels something underneath 
      her.  She reaches down to find someone has placed a BARF BAG 
      on her seat.  SNIGGERING can be heard around the room as 
      Eliza makes this discovery.  Linda, Denise and Cher scoot 
      down to avoid sitting with her.  Off their migration:

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    Oh come on, Linda!  You gotta be 
                    kidding me.  It was like seventh 
                    grade, all over again!                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1413.


      QUICK POP: Young Eliza sits down on a bench next to a group 
      of POPULAR GIRLS ON THEIR PHONES.  They SCATTER like pigeons.

      SAM SAPERSTEIN, president of Kinderlabs Pharmaceuticals, 
      stands at the front of the room and calls the company-wide 
      meeting to order.   

                                  SAPERSTEIN
                    Let s settle, people.  Settle.  I 
                    wanted to take a moment to applaud 
                    you all for the tremendous company-
                    wide effort at our last sales 
                      conference...  

      Saperstein CLAPS.  

                                  SAPERSTEIN (CONT D)
                    I feel like it would be more 
                    impactful if we all clapped.

      The room obliges, bursting into applause.

                                  SAPERSTEIN (CONT D)
                          (smiles)
                    It is.  It s more impactful.  
                          (then)
                    As you all know this company took a 
                    major hit when our best-selling 
                    pediatric nasal spray was pulled 
                    from the shelves for negative side 
                    effects.  The product, naturally, 
                    was recalled and reformulated.  But 
                    whether or not we could regain the 
                    market s trust was TBD.  But now?  
                    Thanks to you all?  It s D!  In a 
                    matter of weeks we ll be back on 
                    the shelves in every major food and 
                    drug chain!  There s one man in 
                      particular I need to single out.  
                    He s new to the company and wearing 
                      a spread-collar dress shirt... 
                    Henry?  Get up here!

      ON HENRY-- standing in the doorway.

                                  SAPERSTEIN (CONT D)
                    Get up here, Henry!  Don t worry, 
                    I m not gonna make out with you.

      The crowd cheers as Henry reluctantly makes his way to the 
      front of the room where Saperstein waits.

                                  SAPERSTEIN (CONT D)
                    I lied.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1414.


      Saperstein kisses Henry on the mouth.

                                  SAPERSTEIN (CONT D)
                          (sotto)
                    I read an article that said British 
                    men are comfortable kissing on the 
                    mouth as a sign of friendship.

                                  HENRY
                    I hadn t seen that...

                                  SAPERSTEIN
                    I ll forward it to you. 
                          (then, to the room)
                    This man did the impossible.  He 
                    took a product whose reputation had 
                    been badly tarnished--

      PUSH IN ON ELIZA-- whose eyes suddenly light up.

                                  SAPERSTEIN (CONT D)
                    --and re-branded it as a product 
                    that consumers can once again love 
                    and trust!  
                          (to Henry)
                    And I love and trust you.

                                  HENRY
                    I love and trust you too, sir.

      Saperstein takes Henry by the shoulders, fondly.

                                  SAPERSTEIN 
                    You re coming to my daughter s 
                    wedding this weekend?

                                  HENRY
                    Wouldn t miss it for the world.

                                  SAPERSTEIN
                    You always say that then you never 
                    show.

                                  HENRY
                    I ll be there.

                                  SAPERSTEIN
                    Bring a date.

      INT. HENRY S OFFICE-- POST MEETING

      Henry ducks into his office to find Eliza waiting for him. 

                                  ELIZA
                    Okay, I want you to do for me what 
                    you did for that nasal spray.

                                  HENRY
                    Sorry?

                                  ELIZA
                    I m Eliza.  I work here.  And it 
                    recently came to my attention that 
                    I have poor instincts, a weak 
                    stomach, no real friends and--

                                  HENRY
                    Loose sexual morals.

                                  ELIZA
                    Have we met?

                                  HENRY
                    Look,  I m not sure what the 
                    confusion is, but I m a marketing 
                    expert--

                                  ELIZA
                    And I want you to re-market me!   
                    Think of me as a blank canvas.
                    With a belly-piercing.  That I m 
                    willing to take out.  

      Ethan enters, fuming.

                                  ETHAN
                    Is it the accent?  I mean, it s 
                    gotta be the accent! 
                          (then, noticing Eliza)
                    Oh, I m sorry.  I see you have 
                    company.

                                  HENRY
                    She was just leaving.

                                  ELIZA
                    No, I wasn t.  
                          (sits)
                    I m not leaving until you say 
                    you ll help.  Please. I want to be 
                    taken seriously.

      Ethan LAUGHS.                         #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1416.


                                  ETHAN
                          (then)
                    Sorry.

                                  ELIZA
                    I just want what even stupid Linda 
                    has...

      Eliza shows off LINDA S INSTAGRAM FEED on her phone.

                                  ELIZA (CONT D)
                    A house and a husband and a hybrid 
                    dog and a new deck that s gonna 
                    look really great once she stains 
                    it.  

                                  ETHAN
                          (re: deck)
                    Me, I d go with a  Mission Brown.   
                    To hide all the foot traffic.

                                  ELIZA
                    I want foot traffic!  Do you know 
                    that when I was sick, not one 
                    person came to visit or called to 
                    see if I was okay?

                                  HENRY
                    Pity, but--

                                  ELIZA
                          (blurts out)
                    I want to be the kind of person 
                    people send  Edible Arrangements  
                    to. 

      ON ETHAN-- eating from the congratulatory Edible Arrangement 
      on Henry s desk.  

                                  ETHAN
                          (frowns)
                    There s always so much melon.

                                  ELIZA
                    I don t want to grow old in a 
                    bathtub surrounded by twenty-five 
                    empty cans of Gingerale. 

                                  HENRY
                    I ve no idea what that means but it 
                    sounds incredibly sad.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1417.


                                  ELIZA
                    It is.  
                          (then)
                    I don t want to be alone.

      Ethan looks at Henry, whose wheels are turning.

                                  ETHAN
                    Please don t tell me you re 
                      considering this--

                                  HENRY
                    If I change her packaging--

                                  ETHAN
                    Her  packaging? 

                                  HENRY
                    Alter her formula--

                                  ETHAN
                    She s not a pharmaceutical product!

      Henry holds a Pantone color chart up to Eliza.

                                  HENRY
                    Yet the same principals apply.     
                    I soften her palette, improve her 
                    taste, engineer new attributes, 
                    promote reliability, build brand 
                      awareness, expand her market-- 

                                  ETHAN
                    You re a megalomaniac.

                                  HENRY
                    I could take this vapid, despised, 
                    social media-obsessed narcissist 
                    and transform her into a valued and 
                    respected woman of stature.  

                                  ELIZA
                    Like Linda!

                                  HENRY
                    Like Linda.

                                  ELIZA
                          (then, quietly)
                    Only prettier.

      Off Henry s look it s the END OF ACT ONE.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1418.

      INT. KINDERLABS -- RECEPTION AREA-- NEXT DAY

      Eliza steps off the elevator with Henry.

                                  HENRY
                    I ll need your implicit trust.  
                    That means you do anything and 
                      everything I say, even if it seems 
                      unorthodox.

                                  ELIZA
                    Totally.  Just no back-door stuff.

                                  HENRY
                    That s another thing.  You mustn t 
                      misinterpret my professional 
                    interest as romantic interest 
                    because I assure you: there isn t 
                    any.  

                                  ELIZA
                    Got it.  We re just friends.

                                  HENRY
                    We re not friends and it s 
                    important to me you acknowledge 
                    that.

                                  ELIZA
                    Fine.  We re not friends and you re 
                    not into me. 
                          (then)
                    So wait, why did you agree to help?

                                  HENRY
                    Because I can.  Now you just go 
                    about your day as you normally 
                    would.

                                    CHARMONIQUE (O.S.)
                    Good morning, how are you?                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1419.


                                  ELIZA
                    OMG, I changed my top so many times 
                    this morning, I swear, I got 
                    niplash and yet my breakfast got 
                    more likes than my outfit which 
                    stinks, speaking of, that bald dude 
                    from the 12th floor took total fart 
                    blanche in the elevator so if you 
                    catch a whiff of something it s 
                    residual him not me, LOL.

      Eliza starts to walk off.  Henry hooks her by the shirt and 
      pulls her back.

                                  HENRY
                    May I?  Point something out?
                          (then, to Charmonique)
                    Every day you greet Eliza, do you 
                    not?  Ask after her?  Inquire as to 
                    how she is?

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    Sure do!  I check in with erry--

                                  HENRY
                    And in the entire time that you ve 
                    worked here, has Eliza ever once 
                    asked how you are doing?
                          (to Eliza)
                    Do you know the first thing about 
                    this woman?  Do you even know her 
                    name?

      Henry whisks the PERSONALIZED MUG off Charmonique s desk and 
      places it behind his back.  Eliza looks completely blank.

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                          (whispers)
                      Charmonique.

                                  ELIZA
                          (whispers)
                    What?

      Henry places the mug back on her desk.

                                  ELIZA (CONT D)
                          (reading)
                       Charmonique? 
                          (to Henry)
                    Okay, but in my defense that s not 
                    a real name.
                          (re: mug)
                    She must have had that custom made.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1420.


                                  HENRY
                    Lesson Number One.  Each and every 
                    morning as you pass Charmonique s 
                    desk, I would like you to ask how 
                    she is doing. 

                                  ELIZA
                    Great.

                                  HENRY
                    We ll start right now.  Open your 
                    lips and repeat after me.  How are 
                    you?  How are yooooooou?   

                                  ELIZA
                          (to Charmonique)
                    How are yooooou?

      HENRY AND ELIZA-- look at Charmonique, expectantly.

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                          (a beat)
                    Goooood.  

      Eliza flashes the thumbs-up and starts off.  Henry pulls her 
      back.

                                  HENRY
                    Then, if you will, a follow up 
                    question.  For example.   And how 
                    did you sleep last night? 

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    You know, not great.  But that s 
                    cause I had Dionysus in the bed 
                    with me.  

                                  HENRY
                    Dionysus?  The god of wine-making?

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    No, my six year-old.  He s got 
                    sleep apnea.

                                  HENRY
                    Did you hear that, Eliza? 
                      Apparently, Charmonique and her son 
                    didn t sleep well.  Now it s your 
                    turn to say something sympathetic.

      HENRY AND CHARMONIQUE-- look at Eliza, expectantly.  

                                  ELIZA
                    I m really glad I don t have kids.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1421.


                                  HENRY
                    That was about you, not her.  Try 
                    again.

      Eliza squirms uncertainly.  Tries again.

                                  ELIZA
                    Having kids must really suck.  
                          (then)
                    For you.


      INT. HENRY S OFFICE -- DAY

      Eliza and Henry sit across from each other with afternoon tea 
      and finger sandwiches between them.

                                  HENRY
                    Right.  We are making pleasant 
                      conversation, we are not on our 
                    phones, we are not scanning the 
                    room to see who else is present, we 
                    are looking into each other s eyes 
                    and giving one and other our 
                    undivided attention. Any questions?

                                  ELIZA
                          (off watercress sandwich)
                    Yes.  Whose idea was it to put 
                    butter?

      Henry ignores that and springs up, grabbing a pad. 

                                  HENRY
                    Next. I d like you to finish each 
                    sentence as honestly as you can.  
                     The thing I am most soothed by 
                    is-- 

                                  ELIZA
                    The sound of gentle rain against 
                    windows.  Or medium rain against 
                    rooftop with overspill from 
                    gutters.  Or heavy rain against 
                    forest canopy with rolling thunder 
                    in the distance.
                          (off Henry s look)
                    I have a rain app, on my phone.

                                  HENRY
                    That s pathetic, please delete it.
                            (continuing)
                     The thing I am most confused by  
                    is--                         #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1422.

                                  HENRY
                     The three things I enjoy most in 
                    life are-- 

                                  ELIZA
                    People injuring themselves on 
                    YouTube.  Inner city children 
                    twerking on Vine. Making it hail on 
                    my housekeeper Lourdes when she 
                    needs quarters for laundry.


      ELIZA S VINE -- QUICK POP 

      Eliza s housekeeper LOURDES holds a basket of clothing.

                                    LOURDES
                    I need quarters for laundry.

      Eliza throws two huge fistfuls of quarters up in the air.


      INT. HENRY S OFFICE -- SAME AS BEFORE

      Henry frowns.

                                  HENRY
                    You know what occurs to me?  You 
                    could use a role model.    

                                  ELIZA
                    I have a role model.

                                  HENRY
                          (pause)
                    I love that you re so invested in 
                    the lives of minor celebrities whom 
                    you ve never met but why not try 
                      demonstrating that same level of 
                    interest for, say, your coworkers.

                                  ELIZA
                    I do! When Rose from the mail room 
                    died, I was the first person to pay 
                    their respects--


      INT. FUNERAL HOME -- FLASHBACK

      Eliza stoops by the open casket where ROSE lies motionless.

                                  ELIZA
                    You sorted the shit out of this 
                    company s mail, Rose. And I, for 
                    one, will not soon forget that.  

      Eliza holds her phone up and takes a selfie of herself, 
      frowning next to Rose in her casket. 


      INT. HENRY S OFFICE-- SAME AS BEFORE  

                                  HENRY
                    Is it possible, you avoid 
                      experiencing real emotion by hiding 
                    behind your ever-present mobile 
                    device?

                                  ELIZA
                    I was making a frowny-face!

                    Are you being a dick?

                                  HENRY
                    It s called sarcasm, but yes.
                          (then)
                    I m giving you an assignment.  
                    Sam Saperstein s daughter is 
                    getting married and I d like you to 
                    attend the event with me.  It s the

      Henry motions to Eliza s ass.

                          (whispers, impressed)
                    Clever and hurtful.

                                  HENRY
                    I want you in something 
                      conservative and tasteful.  No 
                    curves are to be hugged, no 
                    perceived assets on display.  Hair 
                    is to be tamed.  Nails are to be

                    not lacquered in the blood-sucking 
                    red you re so inclined to paint 
                    them.

                    More Ashley less Mary-Kate.


      INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- LATER

      Eliza surveys her building s laundry room.  All the washers 
      and dryers are humming with purpose.  

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    But that was easier said than done.  
                    With my credit cards maxxed and my 
                    own clothes too slutty, I decided 
                    to do what any girl in my pozish 
                    would have done: I decided to steal 
                    something from the laundry room.

      Eliza opens a dryer and pulls out something frilly and pink.  

                                  ELIZA
                    This could work...

                                  BRYN (O.S.)
                    What are you doing with my 
                      nightgown?

      Eliza turns to see Bryn with a bottle of fabric softener.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1425.


                                  ELIZA
                    This is for sleeping?  You sleep in 
                    a gown?

                                  BRYN
                    What do you sleep in?  A pool of 
                    your own vomit?

                                  ELIZA
                          (defensively)
                    Not always.

      Bryn snatches her nightgown back and turns to EXIT.

                                  ELIZA (CONT D)
                    Wait!  Look, I know things between 
                    us haven t been all that neighborly 
                    but I seriously need your help.  I 
                    have this-- work wedding.  And if 
                    you help me dress appropriately, I 
                    promise to never anonymously 
                    complain to management about your 
                    book club again. 

                                  BRYN
                    I knew that was you.
                          (then)
                    You re lucky make-unders are my 
                      everything.


      INT. BRYN S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER

      Eliza follows Bryn through her apartment, a den of girly 
      creativity with dream catchers, chevron stripes, antlers and 
      typography posters.  Bryn motions to a plate of sandwich art.

                                  BRYN
                    Would you like a tiny sandwich made 
                    to look like a baby grand piano?

                                  ELIZA
                    No, thanks.  Are you baking 
                      something?

      Bryn smiles, proudly.

                                  BRYN
                    That s my homemade floor scrub.  I 
                    make it with orange rind, vanilla 
                    beans and brown sugar-- which is an 
                    excellent scouring agent.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1426.


      As Bryn crosses to her vintage armoire and looks through her 
      dress collection, Eliza discreetly grabs the spray bottle of 
      floor cleaner and pumps a few shots onto each wrist.  Behind 
      each ear.  Then directly into her mouth

                                  BRYN (CONT D)
                          (smiles)
                    I have a lot of formal wear  
                    because I have a lot of incredible 
                      friendships. Believe it or not, 
                    I ve been a bridesmaid at over 
                    thirty weddings.  I even wrote a 
                    coffee table book about it--

      Eliza glances over the coffee table book featuring Bryn.  

                                  BRYN (CONT D)
                    Oooh!  How about this one?  

      Bryn selects a pale peach dress.  She puts the hanger around 
      Eliza s head so the dress drapes down her.  

                                  BRYN (CONT'D)
                    Perfect!  And I have the sweetest 
                    purse to go with it!

      Bryn hands a tiny clutch to Eliza, who smirks.

                                  BRYN (CONT D)
                    What?  It s a statement clutch.

                                  ELIZA
                    Is the statement: I don t have room 
                    for my house keys?

                                  BRYN
                    Please shut up, you re ruining this 
                    for me.  Now.  Were you planning on 
                    doing your own hair and makeup?  
                    Because I don t think that s a good 
                    idea. 

      Bryn pushes Eliza into a chair and whips out a professional 
      makeup palette and hot tools.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    Even though she was only helping me 
                    to protect her stupid book club, I 
                    had to admit-- it felt good.  It 
                    felt like... we were friends.

      As Bryn expertly does Eliza s hair and makeup, she sings 
      along to LADY GAGA playing on her vintage hipster radio.                          #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1427.


                                  BRYN
                      Ga-ga-ooh-la-la!

      Eliza now deeply under Bryn s spell, joins in too:

                                  ELIZA
                      Roma-ro-ma-maaa!

                                  ELIZA/BRYN
                          (singing together)
                    I want your loving/I want your 
                      revenge/You and me could write a 
                    bad romance! Ohhh-ohhhh-oh-oh-oh! 


      INT. HALLWAY -- LATER

      Henry knocks briskly on Eliza s door.  After a moment, she 
      answers.  Her wild curls have been blown smooth. Her makeup 
      is subtle and demure.  She looks lovely.  Elegant.

                                  HENRY
                          (flustered)
                    Well.  If you don t mind my saying,  
                    Jennie Garth has nothing on you.  

                                  ELIZA
                    Thanks.

                                  HENRY
                    And you smell remarkably well.

                                  ELIZA
                    That s floor cleaner.

                                  HENRY
                    Oh!  Well.  Shall we?

                                  ELIZA
                    Sure.  Let me just grab the tiniest 
                    purse known to man.

      Eliza shows Henry her tiny purse.

                                  HENRY
                    My!  That is wee.

                                  ELIZA
                    Yeah! You don t even wanna know 
                    where I had to stash my phone.

      Off Henry s expression it s the--

                                      END OF ACT THREE                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1428.


                                          ACT FOUR


      EXT. CHURCH -- LATER

      Henry escorts Eliza up the steps of the church.  

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    I d shed my skin-tight mini and six-
                    inch heels for a gown that left 
                      everything to the imagination.  And 
                    in this sensible wedge shoe?  I 
                    could have danced all night.

      Henry stops and turns to Eliza.

                                  HENRY
                    No phone.

                                  ELIZA
                    No phone.

                                  HENRY
                    Today is about focusing on a beauty 
                    other than your own.

      Eliza smiles.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Something funny?

                                  ELIZA
                    You just called me beautiful.

                                  HENRY
                      I absolutely didn t.

                                  ELIZA
                    You indirectly did.

      Henry rolls his eyes and escorts Eliza inside.


      INT. CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

      Ethan, with a PRETTY GIRL on his arm, chats up Sam Saperstein. 

                                  ETHAN
                    I don t know if you re aware, sir, 
                    but long before Henry started I 
                    laid the groundwork for the 
                      relaunch--                         #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1429.


                                  SAPERSTEIN
                    Not today, kiddo.  I love and value 
                    you and I happen to think you have 
                    a great head of hair.  But today is 
                    about family.

                                  ETHAN
                      Absolutely, sir.  I m in complete 
                      agreement.  Nothing more important.  
                    In fact, we can t wait to get 
                    started with one of our own! 

      Ethan slings an arm around his surprised date.

                                  SAPERSTEIN
                          (scanning the room)
                    I haven t seen Henry...

                                  ETHAN
                    He s probably at the office.  Great 
                    guy, but talk about someone whose 
                      priorities are screwed up--

      Just then Henry and Eliza sail in.  Saperstein lights up.

                                  SAPERSTEIN
                    There he is!  You made it.  And for 
                    once, with a date!  Who is this 
                    beautiful girl on your arm?

                                  HENRY
                    Eliza Dooley, sir.  She works in 
                    sales.

                                  ETHAN
                          (noticing her)
                    Eliza?!  You look amazing.

                                  ELIZA
                    Thanks.

      Saperstein pulls Henry aside.

                                  SAPERSTEIN
                    Careful, son.  That boy wants what 
                    you have.

                                  HENRY
                    Eliza and I are just--  

                                  SAPERSTEIN
                    Perfect together, you really are.  
                    Can you imagine how exquisite the 
                      bone-structure of your off-spring?                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1430.


                                  HENRY
                    No, sir, we re not--

                                  SAPERSTEIN
                    Ever gonna find someone more 
                      physically compatible, I agree. 

      WE PAN OVER TO ELIZA who is chatting with a circle of GUESTS.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    So far so good.  I was maintaining 
                      eye-contact and enjoying the kind 
                    of group chat where I didn t need 
                    to worry about exceeding my data 
                    usage.  And I really liked the 
                    feature where I could tell they 
                    were listening to what I was saying 
                    and not simultaneously checking 
                    their email or buying shoes on 
                    Zappos.  


      INT. CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

      THE BRIDE and THE GROOM stand before a PRIEST at the front of 
      the church, hands clasped.  The bride stands on a ZAPPOS box 
      so she is eye-level with her tall groom.

                                  PRIEST
                    And now, in lieu of vows, Maureen 
                    will recite a poem she wrote for 
                    Terrence, while standing on a box 
                    from Zappos, so that she might look 
                    into his eyes.

                                  BRIDE
                    If I m the fire, you re the spark.
                    If I m the nest, you re my lark.
                    If I m the lock, you re the key
                    If I am Hook, you re my Smee.

      Eliza elbows Henry.

                                  ELIZA
                          (whispers)
                    Did she say Smee?

                                  HENRY
                          (whispers)
                    I believe so, yes. 

                                  BRIDE 
                    If I m the eye, you re the tear.  
                    If I am bagel, you re my schmear.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1431.


                                  ELIZA
                    Why would she be bagel?

                                  HENRY
                    It s unclear-- ssssh.

                                  ELIZA
                    Can I go to the bathroom?

                                  BRIDE
                    If I m the dark, you re the light.  
                    If I m Ben Franklin, you re my 
                    kite.

                                  ELIZA
                    Does Terrence know that he s 
                    marrying a lunatic?

                                  BRIDE (O.S.)
                    If I am Nordstroms, you re  The 
                    Rack.   If I m a nut, you re my--

      The Bride s voice dips down as we PUSH IN ON ELIZA.  Slowly, 
      her condescending smirk begins to soften. 

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    Listening to Maureen recite those 
                    bat-shit crazy vows it hit me:  I 
                    might get thousands of likes and 
                    retweets and favorites but it s 
                    entirely possible no one will ever 
                    look at me the way Terrence was 
                    looking at her.

      QUICK POP:  Young Eliza, at her 7th grade dance, stands by 
      herself watching all the other COUPLES slow dance.  She looks 
      over sees someone s Nokia 8210 left behind on the bleachers.  
      She picks it up and plays SNAKE.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    So I did what I guess I ve always 
                    done when I needed to distract 
                    myself from my feelings--

      ON THE PRIEST-- he smiles at the bride and groom warmly.

                                  PRIEST  
                    Do you, Terrence, take Maureen to 
                    be your lawful wedded wife?

      As Terrence opens his mouth to respond the telltale sounds of 
      CANDY CRUSH echo through the church. Henry looks over at 
      Eliza, who is playing on her phone.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1432.


                                  ELIZA
                          (whispers)
                    Sorry!  I thought it was on silent--
                          (then, loudly)
                    Sorry, you guys!  I thought it was 
                    on silent.

      Saperstein GLARES at Henry.  Ethan CHUCKLES to himself.


      EXT. CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

      Henry and Eliza are in a yelling match outside the church.

                                  ELIZA
                    Look, I m not used to paying 
                    attention to super boring long 
                    stuff, okay?

                                  HENRY
                    No.  Not okay.  It s not just 
                    yourself you ve embarrassed! I 
                      specifically said no phone--

                                  ELIZA
                    Okay, god.  Haven t you ever made a 
                    mistake before?

                                  HENRY
                    Only once.  And that was when I 
                    agreed to help you.

                                  ELIZA
                    Really? Are you helping me?  Or am 
                    I helping you.  Don t think I 
                    didn t notice you didn t have a 
                    date for this event-- 

                                  HENRY
                    Don t flatter yourself!

                                  ELIZA
                    And it s no surprise!  You re an 
                    unfun man.

                                  HENRY
                    Unfun is not a word--

                                  ELIZA
                    You re a holier-than-thou, 
                      antisocial, workaholic wanker!

                                  HENRY
                    And you, my dear, are a lost cause!                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1433.


      Eliza stops, stung by that.

                                  ELIZA
                    You know Henry, you may be good at 
                    your job-- but outside of the 
                    office?  You suck. 

                                  BRYN (O.S.)
                    Ugh!  You SUCK!


      EXT. HALLWAY -- LATER

      Bryn finds the beautiful dress she loaned Eliza crumpled in a 
      plastic grocery bag hanging from her doorknob.

                                  BRYN
                    I knew I shouldn t have loaned her 
                    anything!


      INT. ELIZA S APARTMENT -- LATER THAT NIGHT

      Eliza sits alone, lit by the blue glow of her computer 
      screen.

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    I was done socializing and back to 
                      social-networking.  I wasn t cut 
                    out for offline friendships. 
                    Because the real world sucks.  And 
                    I m not talking about the long-
                    running MTV reality series, as that 
                    shit is a frickin  masterpiece.

      We PUSH IN ON HER SCREEN and TRANSITION TO--


      INT. HENRY S HOUSE -- AT THAT MOMENT

      Henry also sits alone, at his computer.  We REVEAL he s 
      reading about Jennie Garth s divorce.

                                  HENRY
                          (touched by her strength)
                    It s like, back.  The eff.  Up.


      INT. KINDERLABS -- RECEPTION AREA -- NEXT DAY

      Eliza clicks away on her phone as she walks past Charmonique.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1434.


                                  ELIZA
                    Hey, Charmonique.  How was your 
                    night?  Dionysus sleeping any 
                    better?

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    You know what?  He is.  Went ahead 
                    and got him one of those sleep 
                    apnea masks?  Looks like Bane, but 
                    sleeps like a baby.

                                  ELIZA
                    Good deal, see ya later.

      Eliza continues on her way then STOPS.  She whirls around.

                                  ELIZA (CONT D)
                      Charmonique!

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    What!

                                  ELIZA
                    I just asked you about something 
                    that had nothing to do with me and 
                    was interested in your reply for 
                    real! 

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    For real?!

                                  ELIZA
                    For real!   

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    Okay, y all need to keep up the 
                    good work.

                                  ELIZA
                    Yeah...

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    And I don t know if it s like that 
                    between y all?  But y all babies 
                    would have some good-ass bone 
                      structure.


      EXT. STREET-- HENRY S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

      Eliza knocks on Henry s front door, urgently.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1435.


                                  ELIZA
                    Henry?  Are you in there?  Look, I 
                    know we both said some pretty harsh 
                    stuff and I wish I could just 
                    command-z our whole argument.  But 
                    I really think we can move past it!  
                    So if you think so too, please open 
                    this door right now.

      Henry opens the door, dressed impeccably for work.

                                  ELIZA (CONT D)
                    You opened!

                                  HENRY
                    This is the exit from my home.  
                    Excuse me.

      Henry tries to move past Eliza.

                                  ELIZA
                    I m not a lost cause.  What you re 
                    doing with me, it is working.  And 
                    I wasn t on my phone because I was 
                    bored, that wedding gave me feels--

                                  HENRY
                     Feels? 

                                  ELIZA
                    --and that scared me and then I 
                    lashed out and called you a 
                     wanker  which was probably an 
                    incorrect use of the word.

                                  HENRY
                    Actually, it was perfect.

                                  ELIZA
                          (smiles)
                    Okay, that sounded a little bit 
                    like an apology and I totally 
                    forgive you.  Please don t give up 
                    on me.  Please don t let me ruin 
                    your perfect track record.  

      Just then RAIN begins to fall.

                                  HENRY
                    Look at that.  Medium rainfall on 
                    roof with gentle overspill from 
                    gutters.  Your favorite.

      Instinctively, Eliza lifts her phone to capture the moment.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1436.


                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Don t.  You think that you re 
                     getting it  but you are, in fact, 
                    missing it.

      Eliza studies Henry, who stands watching the rain. 

                                  ELIZA
                    Well, I don t see what s so much 
                    better about what you re doing.  
                    Standing here, in your perfectly 
                    pressed suit.  Are you  getting 
                    it? 

      Henry considers that.  He steps from the porch out into the 
      downpour.  Instantly, he is drenched.

                                  HENRY
                    Yes!  I am!

                                  ELIZA
                    Okay, sorry, but I have to get 
                    this!

      Eliza pulls out her phone and Henry runs to avoid being 
      filmed.  He SLIPS and falls.  Eliza LAUGHS.

                                  HENRY
                    See!  That s exactly what we need 
                    to work on.  It s not funny when 
                    someone is injured.

                                  ELIZA
                    Yet, to me-- it is!  That s why I 
                    need your help. 

                                  HENRY
                          (re: ankle)
                    I need your help.

      Eliza runs out into the rain to help Henry who is limping 
      towards the house.  As the camera starts to TRUCK OUT:

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    If that ends up on the web, I 
                    swear, I ll kill you.

                                  ELIZA
                    Okay, but no one calls it  the web  
                    anymore.  Just so you know. 

      As the two share a look it s the END OF SHOW.
