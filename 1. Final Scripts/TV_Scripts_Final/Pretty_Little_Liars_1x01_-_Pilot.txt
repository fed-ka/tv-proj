      FADE IN:


      EXT. ROSEWOOD, PENNSYLVANIA - DAY

      Rosewood is a picture-perfect portrait of suburban America.   
      Boutiques, restaurants, thriving businesses, and seemingly 
      happy CITIZENS flourish in the charming town.  As the sights 
      and SOUNDS of the town overlap WE HEAR a radio report coming 
      from a parked car.    

                                  DISC JOCKEY (V.O.)
                    Labor Day weekend marks the 
                      unofficial end of summer but it 
                    also marks the unsettling 
                      anniversary of the tragedy that 
                    still haunts everyone of us in 
                    Rosewood.  


      EXT. ROSEWOOD NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

      The tree lined street is flanked by traditional, two story 
      houses.  The picket fences are white, the lawns are green and 
      flowers are abundant.  A NEWSPAPER BOY delivers the local 
      paper to a home and we catch a glimpse of the HEADLINE - 
      STILL MISSING. 


      INT. MONTGOMERY HOUSE - ARIA S BEDROOM - DAY

      ARIA MONTGOMERY (16) stands in the middle of the unfurnished 
      room. The door of her empty closet is ajar.  She sees her 
      reflection in the long mirror which hangs on the back of the 
      door.  With a ballet-dancer frame, straight black hair, and 
      pouty lips, Aria knows that she is pretty.

      Just then her mother, ELLA (42), knocks then enters.  Ella is 
      an attractive, well read and liberal mother.  

                                  ARIA
                    It s like starting all over again.  

      Ella sits on the built-in window seat.

                                  ELLA
                    You still have friends here.

      Aria sits next to her mom.  They relate to each other more as 
      friends than mother and daughter.                                                                                       2.



                                  ARIA
                    We ve been gone for two years.  
                    That s a long time. 

                                  ELLA
                    You five were inseparable.  Those 
                    feelings don t just go away. 

                                  ARIA
                    I still think about her.

      Ella picks up Aria s cell phone and hands it to her.

                                  ELLA
                    Call your friends.  I m sure they 
                    miss her, too.  Especially this 
                    weekend.  

      Aria s brother MIKE (15) barges into the room.  He s all boy, 
      all energy and all about Mike.      

                                  MIKE
                    I need a ride to Lacrosse! 


      INT. MONTGOMERY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ENTRY WAY - DAY

      Mike rips through moving boxes.  Ella and Aria enter.

                                  ELLA
                    Lacrosse today?

      BYRON (45), Aria and Mike s father, walks in.  Aging well, 
      he s the handsome professor that the college girls on campus 
      all talk about when they get drunk and horny.

                                  MIKE
                    I just talked to Chad.  First 
                    tryouts are right now.

                                  BYRON
                    I ll take him.  It ll give me a 
                    chance to swing by the campus and 
                    reconnect with some of the faculty.  

      Aria gives her father an odd look.  A look of concern. 

                                  ARIA
                    I ll take him.

                                  BYRON
                    I don t mind, Aria.                                                                                        3.



      As he reaches for his keys she does the same.  

                                  ARIA
                    I don t mind either.

                                  BYRON
                    Okay, then.  

      He hands her the keys.  We get the feeling he wanted to go.

                                  ELLA
                          (to Aria)
                    Think about calling your friends.  

      Aria leans in and gives her mother a touching, light kiss on 
      the cheek.  It s a grown up thing to do but it suits their 
      relationship.  

                                  ARIA
                    Love you, Ella.


      INT. HONDA/EXT. ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 

      Aria pulls the family s blue Honda Civic to the curb and Mike 
      hops out.  Aria calls after him -

                                  ARIA
                    What time am I picking you up?

      As he runs off - 

                                  MIKE
                    Six -


      INT. HONDA/EXT. ROSEWOOD NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 

      Aria reacquaints herself with Rosewood.  She drives down a 
      tree lined residential street.  She stops in front of a 
      pristine Victorian home.  She looks at the name on the 
      mailbox - DiLaurentis.  Aria looks back up to the house.  The 
      curtains are drawn, the flower boxes are empty, and the porch 
      is bare.  The house is vacant.    

      After a moment of reflection, Aria drives on.  She glances at 
      the clock.  It s only 4:15.  Aria picks up her cell phone.  
      She scrolls through her address book and lands on the name 
      EMILY.  After a moment of reluctance, she hits the call 
      button and the phone RINGS.                                                                                          4.



                                  EMILY  (V.O.)
                    It s Emily and you know what this 
                    means.  

      The sound of her friend s voice brings a slight, unknowing 
      smile to Aria s face.  

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    You ll have to leave a message. 

      We hear the BEEP.  Aria contemplates her words but before she 
      talks the phone BEEPS again.  We hear - 

                                  COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
                    If you are satisfied with your 
                    message you may hang up now.  

      A tentative Aria hangs up without trying again.


      INT. HONDA/EXT. ROSEWOOD - HOLLIS COLLEGE - DAY

      Aria drives past the local university.  She stops at a red 
      light.  As Aria glances toward the sidewalk a stunned look 
      registers on her face. 


      INT. HASTING S BARN - NIGHT

      A strong WIND blows outside the barn and THUNDER RUMBLES in 
      the distance.  The year is 2006. Tween-girl posters and 
      Pottery Barn Teen lounge furniture make the rustic barn the 
      perfect spot for tonight s slumber party. 

      Justin Timberlake s  SEXY BACK  plays from the Bose Ipod 
      Dock.  Girls dance and giggle.  A SHARP CRACK OF LIGHTENING 
      RIPS through the barn.  The lights flicker then go dark.  The 
      GIRLS, frightened, cry out as the music abruptly dies.

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

      The girls fumble in the dark.  Someone lights a candle.  
      Someone turns on a flashlight.  

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

        A disturbing KNOCK on the wall from outside the barn.  

                                  ARIA (O.S.)
                      Something s out there. 

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -                                                                                      5.



      The KNOCKING gets louder and closer to the barn door. A hand 
      grabs for the phone.

                                    SPENCER (O.S.)
                    The line s dead.  

      FADE THE WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

      The KNOCKING stops.  The handle on the barn door turns.  

                                  HANNA (O.S.)
                    Jesus. 

      The door opens but no one is there.  Slowly, the girls, 
      huddled together, walk toward the open doorway.  They peer 
      outside.  It s black.  Windy.  Eerie.  Then - 

      A dark figure lunges from out of the darkness.  Everyone 
      SCREAMS!

                                  ALISON 
                    Gotcha.

      ALISON DiLAURENTIS(13) stands in the doorway of the barn.  
      Alison, beautiful, smart and popular, is the type of girl 
      that makes other girls feel cool when they are hanging out 
      with her.  Casual chic, her blonde hair is tossed in a messy 
      pony tail.  

      Everyone breathes a sigh of relief as Alison walks in and 
      tosses her sleeping bag onto the floor.

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -  

      The girls sit on the floor.  The barn is lit by the candles 
      which glow in the center of the their circle.  

                                  ALISON
                    There s nothing to be afraid of. 
                    It ll be fun.

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

                                  ALISON
                    It s the secrets we share that will 
                    bond us forever. 

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

                                  ALISON
                    As I begin to count backwards you 
                    feel your eyelids becoming heavy.                                                                                       6.




      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

                                  ALISON
                    You re completely relaxed.  Forty 
                    two, forty one -

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

                                  ALISON
                    So so tired.  Six, five, four...  

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

      As Aria flickers open her eyes, we see her POV. of the barn.  
      Her friends are sound asleep.  As she looks closer we see one 
      sleeping bag is empty.  The storm has past.  The door to the 
      bar is wide open.  Aria walks to the door and looks outside.  
      We see the outline of a person in the darkness.   

                                  ARIA (O.S.)
                    Ali?

                                    SPENCER 
                    She s gone.  

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

      Aria s POV - The Hastings lawn is lit up by the flashing 
      lights of several police cars.  

      FADE TO WHITE THEN A SMASH CUT JOLTS US TO PRESENT DAY -


      INT. HONDA ACCORD/EXT. ROSEWOOD - DAY 

      Aria remains stunned and transfixed.  We follow her gaze to 
      see - 

      CLOSE ON: A MISSING PERSONS flyer attached to a pole.  On the 
      flyer are two pictures of a blond girl.  On the left she is 
      13 and on the right is a rendering of how she would look 
      present day at 16.  The name under the photographs reads: 
      ALISON DiLAURENTIS and we recognize her from the flashback. 

      Aria is snapped out of her stare when a group of barely legal    
      COLLEGE KIDS walk between her car and the poster.  They laugh 
      and cut up as they walk into SNOOKERS BAR.  Aria glances at 
      the clock - it s only 4:45.  She looks back to Snookers.                                                                                        7.




      INT. ROSEWOOD MALL DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 

      HANNA MARIN (16) stands at the sunglass counter of the 
      upscale department store. Skinny and gorgeous, Hanna is 
      currently the stylish  it girl  at Rosewood High.  She tries 
      on a glamorous pair of expensive shades and reviews her 
      reflection in the mirror.  While still wearing the shades she 
      beckons the MALE CLERK, a thirty-year-old retail lifer.

                                  HANNA
                    Can I see the Guccis in the front?   

      We see that there are a dozen pairs of glasses already out on 
      the counter.

                                  CLERK 
                    I ll have to put a few of these 
                    back.

                                  HANNA
                    But they re all maybe s. 

      She leans across the counter, intentionally giving him a peep 
      show of her cleavage.  He gazes at her boobs -

                                  CLERK
                    Those look - 

      He glances back up at her face. 

                                  HARRY
                    Amazing on you.

                                  HANNA
                          (still flirting)
                    Maybe.

      The clerk complies with her request.  MONA VANDERWALL (16), 
      also thin and attractive, calls to Hanna from across the 
      aisle.  She models a floral summer scarf.  

                                  MONA
                    Is this me?

      Hanna checks her out.

                                  HANNA
                    Or is it a little too much your... 
                    mother?                                                                                      8.



      Mona looks at herself in the mirror.  She takes off the 
      scarf.  TWO WOMEN (40 s) steal glances of Hanna and share 
      gossipy whispers as they pass by her.  Hanna notices.   

      The clerk waits for Hanna to turn back to him.  Finally, she 
      does.  He hands Hanna the Gucci glasses and she tries them 
      on. 

                                  MONA
                    I am loving those glasses.  How 
                    much?

                                  HANNA
                    Three fifty.  

      Hanna looks past Mona and sees Spencer perusing the women s 
      fashions.  As Mona turns her attention to a yellow scarf, 
      Hanna turns to the clerk -

                                  HANNA
                    I ll be right back.

      Hanna approaches SPENCER HASTINGS (16).  Although she is 
      incredibly attractive, Spencer, an over achiever, prides 
      herself on being smart, athletic, disciplined and successful. 

                                  HANNA
                    I can t believe Spencer Hastings 
                    actually has time to shop.  

      Spencer looks up to see Hanna.  She acknowledges her old 
      friend with a welcome smile.

                                  HANNA
                    I mean, you re interning for the 
                    mayor, taking classes at Hollis, 
                      organizing the junior fund-raiser, 
                    and overseeing the barn-to-loft 
                      conversion which you re moving into 
                    this weekend.  And in your leisure 
                    moments, you facebook and tweet.

                                    SPENCER
                    You know me.  I like to stay busy.   

                                  HANNA
                    It s called a summer vacay, Spence.

                                    SPENCER
                    And you spent yours sunning, 
                    shopping and Seaning.                                                                                        9.



                                  HANNA
                    Tweet tweet.  

      The women who were staring at Hanna now steal glances of both 
      Hanna and Spencer.  Spencer and Hanna notice.  

                                    SPENCER
                    I hate this day.

      The WOMEN approach the girls.   

                                  WOMAN #1
                    You were her friends, weren t you?

      Spencer and Hanna share a look, but before they can respond.  

                                  WOMAN #2
                    Know that we still think about her, 
                    too.

                                  WOMAN #1
                    And pray for her.

      The well intentioned but annoying women finally walk away.  

                                    SPENCER
                    She s gone but she s everywhere.

                                  HANNA
                    I can t believe it s been three 
                    years.

                                    SPENCER
                    My parents had the Fields  over for 
                    a  que last weekend.  It was almost 
                    painful to hang out with Emily.  I 
                    mean I still like her, but we just 
                    don t connect anymore. 

                                  HANNA
                    It s weird how we all used to be so 
                    close and now... not so much.

                                    SPENCER
                    Remember what Ali said that night, 
                    about our secrets bonding us 
                    forever?

      Hanna nods. 

                                    SPENCER
                    I think it was the opposite.                                                                                    10.



      They share a bitter sweet moment of acknowledgement.  After a 
      beat, in typical Hanna fashion, she lightens the mood.  Hanna 
      refers to the blouse.

                                  HANNA
                    What s the occasion?

                                    SPENCER
                    Dinner in the city with the fam.  
                    We re meeting Melissa s fiance.

                                  HANNA
                    Did Miss Perfect find Mister 
                    Perfect?

                                    SPENCER
                    He s a med student.  Everyone s 
                    thrilled.

      Spencer s indifferent tone suggests that she could care less.  

                                  HANNA
                    Then that s not the right top. 

      Hanna sets her handbag down and looks through a rack of 
      clothes. 

                                  HANNA
                    You need to turn heads. 

                                    SPENCER
                    Away from Melissa?  Please.

      Hanna pulls a sexy, low-cut blouse from the rack and shows it 
      to Spencer.

                                  HANNA
                    I like this for you. 

      Spencer thinks about it.

                                  HANNA
                    Trust me, heads will turn and if 
                    there s a man named Dick in the 
                    room he ll be standing at 
                      attention.

                                    SPENCER
                    Hanna, you re incorrigible.   

                                  HANNA
                    I try.                                                                                       11.



      After a beat.

                                  HANNA
                    See you around the playground.  

                                    SPENCER
                    See you.  

      Spencer turns her attention back to the clothes.  

      Hanna puts the glasses down on her face and walks toward the 
      exit.  She passes by a SECURITY GUARD.  They lock eyes. Is he 
      watching her?

      The sunglass clerk glances up as Hanna leaves.  Confused, he 
      looks down at his counter of pricey glasses and starts 
      counting.

      Hanna feels a rush of nervousness and excitement as she nears 
      the exit door.  


      INT. ROSEWOOD MALL - DAY 

      Hanna, still wearing the Gucci shades, walks out of the 
      store.  The thrill of the moment reads on her face.  

                                  SECURITY GUARD (O.S.)
                    Miss.

      The security guard reaches for her arm.  Hanna s heart POUNDS 
      RAPIDLY against her chest as he grabs her.  She slowly turns 
      to him -  

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    You forgot your bag.

      Relief washes over her as the guard gives Hanna her purse.  
      She flashes him a huge smile.

                                  HANNA
                    Thank you.

      Hanna walks on.  She rounds the corner and breathes a sigh of 
      relief.  A moment later, Mona joins her. 

                                  MONA
                    Jesus, I thought you were busted.

      Hanna notices the yellow scarf tied around Mona s neck.  As 
      Hanna pulls off the sales tag -                                                                                    12.



                                  HANNA
                    Nice scarf.

                                  MONA
                    Nice glasses.

      As they head off together CAMERA PANS UP to see a security 
      camera pointed in Hanna and Mona s direction.


      INT. SNOOKERS BAR - DAY 

      The place is exactly what a college bar should be.  Casual, 
      worn and welcoming.  We find Aria sitting at the bar as the 
      BARTENDER approaches her -

                                  BARTENDER
                    What can I get you?

                                  ARIA
                    A beer please.  Whatever s on tap.

      He pours her beer then sets the pint on the bar in front of 
      her.  Aria takes a sip but spits it back into the glass. 

                                  EZRA (O.S.)
                    Are you alright down there? 

      She turns.  EZRA, 24, sits three stools down from her.  She 
      notices his messy, blondish hair and ice-blue, Siberian husky 
      eyes.  

                                  ARIA
                    I ve been in Europe for two years.  
                    The beer s better there.

                                  EZRA
                    Where in Europe?

                                  ARIA
                    Finland.

      He smiles and his eyes brighten.  

                                  EZRA
                    I spent a few nights in Reykjavik 
                    on my way to Amsterdam.  There was 
                    this awesome rave near the harbor.  
                    It went on for days. 

                                  ARIA
                    What are you drinking?                                                                                    13.



                                  EZRA
                    Scotch.

      Ezra scoots over to the stool next to Aria.

                                  EZRA
                    Want one?  

      She nods and he signals the bartender.

                                  EZRA
                    I was really depressed to come back 
                    after Amsterdam. 

                                  ARIA
                    Tell me about it.  I cried the 
                    entire way home.  

      The bartender sets up their round of drinks.  Aria sips her 
      scotch and enjoys the warm feeling she gets as the drink 
      rolls across her tongue.  He watches her. 

                                  ARIA
                    Do you go to Hollis?

                                  EZRA
                    I just graduated.  I m about to 
                    start my first teaching job.  

                                  ARIA
                    I think I d like to teach. 

      The juke box plays  Happiness  by the Fray.

                                  ARIA
                    I love this song.  It s so pure.

                                  EZRA
                    B26. 

      She gets that he played it -

                                  ARIA
                    Thanks for the moment.

                                  EZRA
                    What s your major?

      She realizes he thinks she s in college and goes with it.

                                  ARIA
                    I m leaning toward English.                                                                                    14.



                                  EZRA
                    That s what I m teaching!  

                                  ARIA
                    I write too but -

      Ezra motions to the bartender and he brings another round. 

                                  ARIA
                    So far it s mostly personal stuff.  
                    I don t know if I could share it.  

                                  EZRA
                    I m impressed. 

                                  ARIA
                    Why?

      The bartender refills their glasses and they both take a sip.  
      Feeling relaxed and friendly they nudge a little closer to 
      each other.

                                  EZRA
                    I dabbled in writing but I didn t 
                    have the passion.  If you re 
                    writing for yourself, it s pure 
                    passion.

      She thinks about it.  She s inspired by his insight.  

                                  EZRA
                    Maybe you d let me read something 
                    of yours.  

                                  ARIA
                    You d really want to?  

                                  EZRA
                    You re smart.  You ve traveled.  
                    You have good taste in music.  I d 
                    like to know more about you.

      She considers his complement and accepts it without 
        reservation.

                                  ARIA
                    Thank you.

                                  EZRA
                    So you ll let me read you?

                                  ARIA
                    I think I will.                                                                                    15.



      She looks into his eyes which are getting bluer by the 
      second.  


      INT. SNOOKERS BATHROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Ezra hoists Aria onto the sink and she wraps her legs around 
      his waist.  She tastes the scotch on his lips.  They kiss 
      slowly, lightly then it s like the damn busts open.  

      Their bodies press against each other and their chemistry is 
      undeniable.  She accidentally leans back and turns on the 
      water.  They both laugh.  Then their lips find each other 
      again.  Slowly and lightly kissing.  Ezra pulls away from 
      Aria and looks at her.  Studies her.  She leans in and kisses 
      him as we FADE OUT.


      INT. HONDA CIVIC - MORNING

      Byron drives Mike and Aria to school.  The radio plays and is 
      tuned to a PROGRESSIVE ROCK station.  They all listen to the 
      SONG.  The second Byron pulls to the curb -  

                                  MIKE
                    Later. 

      Mike shoots out of the car.  Aria opens her door but Byron 
      gently touches her forearm.   

                                  BYRON
                    Hang on a sec. 

      She turns to him.

                                  ARIA
                    It s the first day.  I don t want 
                    to be late.  

                                  BYRON
                    I just want to make sure you re 
                    okay. 

                                  ARIA
                    With what?

                                  BYRON
                    I can t imagine how hard it s been.  
                    Keeping quiet.  But I love you.  
                    You know that, right?

                                  ARIA
                    Yeah, I know.                                                                                    16.



                                  BYRON
                    And you know I love your mother.  

      Aria gives him a look that says  I don t know if I know that 
      or not.   She climbs out of the car.


      EXT. ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

      As Aria somberly watches her father drive away we CUT TO:


      EXT. ROSEWOOD - STREET - ALLEY - DAY 

      As Aria remembers, the flashback is shot in her POV. - The 
      year is 2006 and it s a bright summer day.  Aria and Alison 
      eat frozen yogurts as they walk down the sidewalk.  MONA 
      VANDERWALL calls to them from across the street.  At 13, Mona 
      was the styleless chubby girl that was always trying to hang 
      out with them.    

                                  MONA
                    Alison!   

      Alison makes an  ugh  face.

                                  MONA
                    Aria!

      Alison grabs Aria s arm and pulls her into an alley. 

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

      They successfully avoided Mona and head down the alley.

                                  ALISON
                    Is she ever going to get a clue? 
                    What a dork.  Switch?

      They trade cups.  

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

      Alison notices something up ahead.  We (ARIA) follow her gaze 
      to a familiar Honda Civic which is parked in a no parking 
      zone. 

                                  ALISON
                    Isn t that your dad s car?

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -                                                                                    17.



      Looking into the car, we recognize Aria s father but not the 
      pretty twenty-one-year-old COLLEGE GIRL sitting next to him. 

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

      The college girl leans in close to Byron and he kisses her on 
      the mouth.  FADE TO WHITE -


      EXT. ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - SIDEWALK - MORNING

                                  EMILY (O.S.)
                    Aria?!

      Aria snaps out of her reflective moment and turns to see an 
      extremely surprised EMILY walking toward her.  At sixteen, 
      Emily Fields works hard to maintain an athlete s body.  Her 
      sense of style is J-Crew sporty.  A competitive swimmer, she 
      looks and lives the part. 

                                  EMILY
                    When did you get back?

                                  ARIA
                      Yesterday.

      Emily and Aria share an affectionate hug. 

                                  EMILY
                    I almost didn t recognize you.  I 
                    think the last time we saw each 
                    other you had a pink stripe in your 
                    hair.  

                                  ARIA
                    Yeah well, when your parents preach 
                      individuality and you don t know 
                    who you are... 

                                  EMILY
                    You wore it well.

      First BELL RINGS.  They both walk toward the entrance.

                                  EMILY
                    You should have called.  It s so 
                    weird just running into you here.

                                  ARIA
                    We kind of lost touch, Emily.  
                    Remember?

      She hits a nerve -                                                                                    18.



                                  EMILY
                    Maybe that made it easier to keep 
                    our secrets.   

      They exchange a look of understanding and guilt.   

                                  ARIA
                    I saw a poster of Alison yesterday.  
                    Of what she d look like now.

                                  EMILY
                    It s awful.  I mean...

      A mournful resignation comes over her.

                                  EMILY
                    We all know she s dead. 

      Aria tosses her a look.  

                                  EMILY
                          (looking for reassurance)
                    Right?

                                  ARIA
                    I ve just never heard anyone say 
                    it.  


      INT. ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASSROOM - MORNING

      Emily and Aria walk into the classroom where STUDENTS hang 
      out, flirt, and catch up.  NOEL KAHN (16), Rosewoods  A  list 
      jock and party boy notices Aria.  

                                  NOEL
                    Aria Montgomery, right?  I thought 
                    you moved to the North Pole.

                                  ARIA
                    Not exactly.

      Boyishly handsome, Noel could be an Abercrombie billboard 
      model.  

                                  NOEL
                    Didn t you used to have a crush on 
                    me?

                                  ARIA
                    I don t know.  Did I?

      She leaves him hanging and finds a seat next to Emily.                                                                                     19.



                                  EMILY
                    I hear the new teacher s really 
                    hot.

      As Aria looks up she sees Hanna walk into the classroom. 

                                  ARIA
                          (surprised)
                    Is that Hanna? 

      Mona enters immediately after her.

                                  EMILY
                    And where there s Hanna, there s 
                    Mona.

                                  ARIA
                    That s Mona Vanderwall?  The dork? 

      Hanna sees Emily then her eyes shift to Aria.  Aria waves to 
      her.  Hanna tosses her a hello nod and sits on the other side 
      of the room.  Aria turns her attention to Emily -

                                  ARIA
                    What s up with her?  Are you two 
                    fighting?

                                  EMILY
                    We didn t just fall out of touch 
                    with you, Aria.  We all fell out of 
                    touch with each other. 

      The final BELL rings but the teacher isn t in the room.  The 
      door opens.  Everyone turns to check out -

      Spencer as she walks into the classroom.  When she realizes 
      all eyes are on her she offers up a confident smile.  Aria 
      watches as Spencer happily finds a seat in the front row.  
      Before she sits down, Spencer connects eyes with Hanna.  They 
      exchange warm smiles. 

                                  EMILY
                          (to Aria)
                    They re not close anymore but 
                    they re both popular so...

      Aria looks back to Emily -

                                  ARIA
                    So they re friendly but not 
                    friends.  

      Emily tosses Aria a both sarcastic and sad smile.                                                                                      20.



                                  ARIA
                    So who are your friends?

      It s not easy for Emily but she extends herself -

                                  EMILY
                    Since Alison, it s been kind of 
                    hard for me.  

      Aria happens to look past Emily.  She sees a BLONDE GIRL 
      standing across the street from the school.  She is staring 
      at Aria and she looks so much like the girl in the rendered 
      photo of Alison that Aria is taken aback.    

      The teacher walks in and writes his name on the chalkboard -  
      MR. FITZ.  As Mr. Fitz turns we realize that he is Ezra, the 
      cute guy Aria made out with in the bathroom at Snookers.  

      He proudly surveys his first class.  His eyes fall upon - 

                                  EZRA
                    Holy shit.

      Aria looks up to see Ezra, looking adorable in his jacket and 
      tie with his hair neatly groomed.  She is as surprised to see 
      him as he is to see her. 

      The chorus of chatter falls silent and all the students turn 
      to see who Ezra is looking at.  Spencer looks back and is 
      stunned to see Aria.  

                                    SPENCER
                    Holy shit, indeed.  

      All four girls exchange looks.  It s not the homecoming Aria 
      would have wished for.  With all eyes still on her, Aria s 
      phone RINGS, signaling she has received a text message.  

                                  ARIA
                    Sorry.

      The apology is for more than the interruption.  Aria quickly 
      pulls her phone from her bag and silences the RING.  Ezra 
      clears his throat and composes himself. 

                                  EZRA
                    I m Mister Fitz.  Your new English 
                    teacher.

      Aria looks down at her phone.  A shiver runs up her spine as 
      she reads... CLOSE ON MESSAGE:  Aria: Maybe he fools around 
      with students all of the time.  A lot of teachers do.  Just 
      ask your dad. - A                                                                                      21.



      Emily, Spencer and Hanna see the look on Aria s face as she 
      reads the text.  It s as if she s seen a ghost.  Aria quickly 
      looks back out the window - the blonde girl is gone.  


                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    22.

      INT. FIELDS  HOME - KITCHEN - STAIRWELL - DAY

        Conservative Ralph Lauren plaids and prints are the motif of 
      this house that shows like a model home.  Everything is in 
      its proper place, always.  Emily grabs a diet soda from the 
      refrigerator.  

                                  PAM (O.S.)
                    Someone finally bought the 
                      DiLaurentis  place. 

      The comment registers on Emily s face.  She turns to her 
      mother as she closes the refrigerator door.  

                                  EMILY
                    It s weird to think of other people 
                    living there.

      PAM FIELDS, Emily s mom, arranges an overflowing welcome 
      basket on the counter.  Like her basket she is well put 
      together.  A conservative dresser, she always looks  nice.   
      As they converse we feel a disconnect between them.  Emily 
      also feels it.  It s not intentional, it s just there.   

                                  PAM
                    Blue or green?

      She holds up the two ribbons for Emily to choose.  

                                  EMILY
                    Aria s back.  It was good to see 
                    her but it felt different.

                                  PAM
                    Does she still have that horrible 
                    pink hair?  

                                  EMILY
                    No, Mom.  She doesn t.  

                                  PAM
                    Never mind, I m going with yellow.   

      Emily watches her mother meticulously tie the bow around the 
      basket.     

                                  PAM
                    I never understood that family.  
                    Why would her mother let her do 
                    that?                                                                                        23.



                                  EMILY
                    Because they believe their kids are 
                    their equals, not their property.

                                  PAM
                    I don t think you re my property, 
                    Emily, but as your mother, I have 
                    the responsibility to guide you in 
                    the right direction.  To teach you 
                    the difference between right and 
                    wrong.  What kind of parent would I 
                    be if I allowed you to walk around 
                    looking like a gothic?  

                                  EMILY
                    A Gothic?

                                  PAM
                    That lifestyle might fly in Europe 
                    but it won t get you far in 
                    Rosewood.  

                                  EMILY
                    Not everybody dreams of making it 
                    in Rosewood, Mom.  

      Emily turns and stares out the window.

                                  EMILY
                    Some people dream of making it out. 


      EXT. ST. GERMAIN HOUSE (AKA DILAURENTIS HOUSE) - DAY

      Emily, holding the welcome basket, stands on the sidewalk and 
      stares up at the house.  It is the same house Aria stopped in 
      front of on her first day back.  A moving truck is parked in 
      the driveway of the Victorian home.  When she breaks her 
      gaze, Emily notices a huge pile of trash on the street curb. 

      Emily recognizes an old overstuffed bedroom chair, clothes, 
      notebooks and school books.  Something in particular grabs 
      Emily s attention.  She reaches down and picks up a sixth 
      grade swimming medal. 

                                  MAYA (O.S.)
                    You want that? 

      Emily spins around.  MAYA (16) sticks out her hand. 

                                  MAYA
                    Maya St. Germain.  Aka  new girl .                                                                                     24.



      Emily quickly sizes her up.  Maya has tawny-colored skin and 
      wild, black-brown curly hair.  She wears a yellow tank top 
      that intentionally reveals bits of her orange bra underneath.

                                  EMILY
                    I m Emily.  

      She hands her the basket.

                                  EMILY
                    Welcome to the neighborhood.  

      Maya looks at the basket and facetiously delivers -

                                  MAYA
                    Foie gras and cornichons, my 
                      favorites.  

                                  EMILY
                    It s from my mother.

                                  MAYA
                      I figured.  
                          (she gestures to the curb)
                    That stuff was in my room.  You can 
                    have anything you want.

                                  EMILY
                    It all belonged to Alison.

                                  MAYA
                    Is she a friend of yours?

                                  EMILY
                    She was.  A long time ago.  

                                  MAYA
                    That s all I get?  No details?

      Emily is surprised by Maya s forward questions and attitude.

                                  EMILY
                    There were five of us who used to 
                    hang out.  But we don t anymore. 

      Maya looks up at her bedroom window then back to Emily.

                                  MAYA
                    Would it be outrageous of me to ask 
                    if you ll help with my last few 
                    boxes?                                                                                       25.



                                  EMILY
                    Yes.

      Then Emily surprises Maya with a receptive smile -

                                  EMILY
                    But I don t mind.   


      INT.  MAYA S BEDROOM - DAY 

      Emily follows Maya into the room.  They each carry in a 
      moving box.  

                                  MAYA
                    So why aren t you still friends 
                    with the girl who used to live 
                    here? 

      Emily sets down the box and looks around the room.

                                  EMILY
                    You ask a lot of questions.

                                  MAYA
                    How else am I supposed to get to 
                    know you?

                                  EMILY
                    There you go.  Another question.

                                  MAYA
                    Fine.  Your turn.  Ask me anything.

      Emily notices a photograph of a  surfer-grunge  boy on Maya s 
      night stand.  She picks it up and looks at him. 

                                  EMILY
                    Is this your boyfriend?

                                  MAYA
                    His name s Justin.      

                                  EMILY
                    He s cute.

                                  MAYA
                    He s also three thousand miles 
                    away.  

      Emily sets down the photo.                                                                                    26.



                                  EMILY
                    My boyfriend s name is Ben.

                                  MAYA
                    What s he like?  

                                  EMILY
                    He s a swimmer, like me.

      Maya looks Emily up and down which makes Emily feel a little 
      weird. 

                                  MAYA
                    I bet you re good.  You totally 
                    have the body.

        Embarrassed, Emily turns her attention to the sound of a 
      truck pulling up outside.  She glances out the window to see 
      a backhoe being unloaded from a flatbed. 

                                  MAYA
                    My mother s a cellist.  They re  
                    building a studio.  

                                  EMILY
                    Do you play?

                                  MAYA
                    Yeah, but not the cello.

      Emily smiles.  This girl s a trip.

                                  MAYA
                    So if you re a big jock does that 
                    mean you d kill me if I smoked a 
                    little weed? 

                                  EMILY
                    Now?    

                                  MAYA
                    I won t if you don t want me to.

                                  EMILY
                    Where are your parents?

                                  MAYA
                    Relax.  They re out.  

      Maya reaches under her bed and pulls out an Altoids tin.  She 
      opens it and takes out a joint.  She turns to Emily to make 
      sure it s okay with her.                                                                                    27.



                                  EMILY
                    Go ahead.  

      Maya lights the joint and inhales.  Emily watches as Maya 
      gracefully pulls the joint from her frosted lips.  She looks 
      sexy.  Maya notices Emily looking at her.  Emily darts her 
      eyes away.   

                                  MAYA
                    Want a hit?

      Emily wants to look and feel sexy, too.

                                  EMILY
                    Okay.

      As Emily takes the joint from Maya, their hands brush and 
      their eyes meet.  Emily hesitates then brings the joint to 
      her lips.  She takes a drag.  Then coughs.  

                                  MAYA
                    First time?

                                  EMILY
                    No.

      Off of Maya s knowing look - 

                                  EMILY
                    Yes. 

                                  MAYA
                    So I m corrupting you.

      Emily hands her back the joint. 

                                  MAYA
                    Are you okay with that?

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah, I think I am.


      INT. MOSHULU RESTAURANT - EVENING

      The restaurant is aboard a clipper ship in the Philadelphia 
      harbor.   

      VERONICA HASTINGS(42) and PETER HASTINGS(44) sip cocktails at 
      their table.  A successful and cut throat attorney, he knows 
      how to fill a suit.  Once proper eye candy, Veronica is now a 
      proper wife and mother.  Spencer returns to the table from 
      the ladies room.                                                                                      28.


      She wears the sexy, low-cut top that Hanna picked for her, 
      and turns heads as she sits at the table with her parents. 
      Peter looks past her to -

                                  PETER
                    Here s Melissa! 

      Peter stands as MELISSA HASTINGS walks toward the table.  The 
      second she reaches him, Peter embraces her.  

                                  PETER
                    You look fantastic!

      At 22 Melissa seems to have it all.  Looks, brains, an 
      acceptance to Wharton School of Business and now the perfect 
      fiance.  

      Veronica turns her attention to Melissa s fiance, WREN (24). 
      Tall and lanky, with a model-cute face, and messy-shaggy 
      hair, he also gleans Spencer s attention.  

                                  VERONICA
                    You must be Wren.

                                  WREN
                          (British accent)
                    It s nice to meet you.  

      She gives him a hug. 

                                  VERONICA
                    I love your accent.  You ll have to 
                    talk all night.

                                    SPENCER
                    With Melissa at the table?

      Veronica and Peter throw Spencer a harsh look.  With no 
      fanfare, Melissa introduces her sister to her fiance.  

                                    MELISSA
                    Wren - Spencer.

      He shakes her hand. 

                                  WREN
                    Hello, Spencer.   

      He locks eyes with her.  Takes the time to connect with her.  
      It momentarily disarms Spencer.  

                                    SPENCER
                    Hi.                                                                                    29.



      As they all sit, the WAITER approaches their table.

                                  WAITER
                      Cocktails?

                                    SPENCER
                    I ll have a vodka tonic.

                                  VERONICA
                    That s not funny, Spencer.

                                  WREN
                      I actually will have a vodka tonic, 
                    please.


      INT. MOSHULU RESTAURANT - EVENING

      The waiter delivers Wren s drink.

                                  WREN
                    Thank you. 

      Wren takes a sip of his cocktail and puts the glass down in 
      front of Spencer.  She looks at him curiously.  Did he do 
      that intentionally? 

      Caught up in their own moment, Peter and Veronica exchange 
      excited looks.  They re happy with themselves.

                                    MELISSA
                    What s going on with you two?

                                  VERONICA
                    Your father and I have an 
                      engagement present to give to you 
                    and Wren.

      Spencer reaches for Wren s vodka-tonic.  He looks over at her 
      as she takes a sip.  He doesn t offer a reaction.  

                                  PETER
                    We bought the townhouse you ve been 
                    renting, Melissa.

                                  VERONICA
                    And we re redoing it from top to 
                    bottom.  Of course we left the 
                    choice of finishes up to you both, 
                    because it s yours.

      Melissa squeals with excitement.                                                                                      30.



                                    MELISSA
                    No way!  

                                  WREN
                    That s incredibly generous of you. 

                                    MELISSA
                    And while the place is under 
                      construction, we can stay in the 
                    loft.  

                                    SPENCER
                    I spent the summer redoing the loft 
                    for me to move into.

                                    MELISSA
                    It s just for a few months.

                                  PETER
                    It would be helpful to everyone.

                                    SPENCER
                    Everyone but me -

                                  VERONICA
                    Come on, Spencer -

      Spencer stares daggers at Melissa.  

                                    MELISSA
                    I was hoping you d be happy for me.

                                    SPENCER
                    You know what they say about hope.

      Spencer stands.

                                    SPENCER
                    It breeds eternal misery.

      Spencer leaves the restaurant.  Wren watches her walk 
      outside.

                                  WREN
                    It sounded like Spencer was 
                    counting on moving into the barn. 

                                    MELISSA
                    Don t worry about Spencer.  She ll 
                    get over it. 

      Wren gently squeezes her hand and offers her a warm smile.                                                                                      31.



                                  WREN
                          (standing)
                    If you ll excuse me for a moment.  
                    Nature calls.  

      As he heads for the bathroom, Veronica playfully mimics his 
      accent -  

                                  VERONICA
                    Nature calls. 
                          (as herself)
                    Sexy.

                                    MELISSA
                    Tell me about it.


      EXT. MOSHULU RESTAURANT - EVENING

      Spencer stands off to the side of the entrance and smokes a 
      cigarette.  When the restaurant door opens, she hides the 
      Marlboro.  When she sees that it s Wren, she pulls the 
      cigarette back to her lips.  

                                  WREN 
                    Do you have an extra smoke?

                                    SPENCER
                    Shouldn t you know better?  You are 
                    a med student, right?  

                                  WREN
                    You re a bit of a smart ass.

                                    SPENCER
                    A bit?

      He throws her a  stop messing with me  look.  She gives him a 
      cigarette.  She watches him light it and take a deep drag.

                                    SPENCER
                    Does my sister know you smoke?

                                  WREN
                    Does she have to know everything?

      He looks at her and smiles.  She thinks he might be flirting 
      with her. 

                                  WREN
                    So why are you the black sheep?                                                                                    32.



                                    SPENCER
                    I m captain of the field hockey 
                    team, maintaining a 4.0 G.P.A. and 
                    president of my class.  The 
                    Hastings don t breed black sheep. 

      He detects the sadness in her ironic tone.  

                                  WREN
                    I m sorry we re moving into your 
                    loft.  If you want me to say 
                      something.

                                    SPENCER
                    It wouldn t make a difference.  But 
                    thanks for being sorry.

      Wren hands Spencer her lighter back.  

                                    SPENCER
                    You re not like Melissa s usual 
                      boyfriends. 

      Their hands touch for longer than they should. 

                                  WREN
                    How am I unusual?

      As much as Spencer would like to pursue this -  

                                    SPENCER
                    We better get back.

      Finally, she walks away.  When she reaches the door, she 
      turns back to him.  

                                    SPENCER
                      I actually like you.  That s what s 
                    unusual.

      She tosses him a sexy look then heads inside.  On his look of 
      intrigue we FADE OUT.  

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    33.



                                  ACT THREE


      EXT. ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING 

      It s early.  The school is empty.  Almost.


      INT. ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS ROOM - MORNING 

      Aria walks into the classroom and closes the door behind her.  
      Ezra looks up from his desk.  They are alone.  He looks at  
      her for a long moment.  

                                  EZRA
                    You told me you went to Hollis.

                                  ARIA
                    No.  I said I was thinking about 
                    majoring in English and that s 
                    true.  

      He looks down at his leather bound lesson planner, closes it 
      then looks back up at her.  She reads his frustration.

                                  ARIA
                    We can still be together.  Nobody 
                    has to know.  

      She approaches his desk and leans against it.     

                                  EZRA
                    Look, I think you re amazing, Aria.  

      She moves her hand over to touch his.  He doesn t move his 
      hand away.

                                  EZRA
                    When I met you I was like - Who is 
                    this girl?  She s not like anyone 
                    I ve ever met.  

                                  ARIA
                    I feel the same way about you -

      But then Ezra stands and walks toward the door.  He opens it. 

                                  EZRA
                    We just can t.  It s not right.

      He walks out.                                                                                      34.




      INT. ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING 

      Ezra walks down the empty hall.  Aria walks out of the 
      classroom and calls to him.

                                  ARIA
                    Ezra.

      He stops and turns back to her. 

                                  ARIA
                    Did you tell anyone about us?

                                  EZRA
                    No.  

      He walks on.  Aria looks down at her phone.  She pulls up the 
      text from  A . 

                                  ARIA
                          (to herself)
                    Well, somebody knows.  


      INT. MARIN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MORNING 

      Hanna and her boyfriend, SEAN, sit close to each other on the 
      couch.  Gifted with good looks, brains and athletic ability, 
      he is Rosewood High School s most likely to succeed at 
      everything he tries.  

      They sip their morning coffees as they review their school 
      work.  Hanna looks over at him.  God, he s cute.  She 
      casually puts her hand on his leg.  

      After a moment, Hanna slides her hand up Sean s thigh, toward 
      the crotch of his Paper Denim jeans.   

                                  SEAN
                    Whoa.

      He pushes her hand away.

                                  SEAN
                    You know I can t.  

                                  HANNA
                    If you won t tell I won t tell.  

      She leans over and kisses him on the neck.                                                                                      35.



      ASHLEY, Hanna s mother walks through the room.  At 36, Ashley 
      is well built and well maintained.  An executive VP at a 
      local bank, she works hard to make her personal and 
        professional successes look effortless.  

      Sean backs away from Hanna.  Ashley is in the middle of a 
      business call while she attempts to get ready for work.   

                                  SEAN
                    Good morning, Mrs. Marin.  

      Heading into the kitchen, she tosses him a friendly, hello 
      wave.  Hanna scoots back closer to Sean.  She mocks his 
      polite tone. 

                                  HANNA
                    Good morning, Mrs. Marin.

                                  SEAN
                    What am I supposed to say?  Yo, 
                    bitch?  

                                  HANNA
                    I love it when you talk dirty.  

      She rubs up against him -

                                  SEAN
                    Jesus, Hanna.  You know how hard 
                    this is for me.  

                                  HANNA
                    It doesn t have to be.  

      He pushes her away.    

                                  SEAN
                    I made a commitment.  It s 
                    upsetting that you don t respect 
                    that.  

      She s annoyed.

                                  HANNA
                    You are into girls, right?  

      He s pissed. 

                                  SEAN
                    You knew how I felt about this 
                    before we started going out.  I was 
                    totally up-front with you.                                                                                      36.



                                  HANNA
                    You re right.  I m sorry.  And I 
                    was just kidding.  I totally 
                    respect the  V  club and everything 
                    it stands for.  

      He believes her.  

                                  SEAN
                    You know that it s not because I 
                    don t want to.  

      He gives her a sweet kiss on the cheek.  

                                  SEAN
                    This is not easy for me. 

      She throws him a forced, seemingly confident smile.

                                  HANNA
                    I know.  And I completely support 
                    your commitment to virginity.   

                                  SEAN
                    Thanks.  That means a lot to me.

      He hugs her.  Sean doesn t see the unsettled look that reads 
      on Hanna s face as she hugs him back. 


      EXT. ROSEWOOD RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 

      Emily and Maya walk down the sidewalk.  Emily notices that 
      their hands keep bumping into each other.  She notices Maya s 
      soft skin.  Her eyes.  Her lips.  

                                  MAYA
                    Thanks for walking me home.   

                                  EMILY
                    It s no big deal. 

      When they approach Maya s house, Emily sees a work CREW 
      tossing Alison s old stuff into a dumpster.  Maya reads the 
      disquieted look on her face.

                                  MAYA
                    Are you okay?

      Emily turns to Maya -

                                  EMILY
                    It s hard for me to talk about.                                                                                      37.



      Maya listens, patient and engaged.  

                                  EMILY
                    I didn t tell you everything about 
                    the girl who used to live here.  

                                  MAYA
                    Alison. 

                                  EMILY
                    She disappeared during the summer 
                    of seventh grade.  She s still 
                    missing.  

                                  MAYA
                    That must have been awful for you.

                                  EMILY
                    I used to think if I didn t talk 
                    about her I wouldn t think about 
                    her.  

                                  MAYA
                    But you still do.   

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah.  

                                  MAYA
                    I m sorry. 

      Maya leans over and gives Emily a kiss on the cheek.  When 
      she goes to kiss her other cheek their lips almost touch.  

                                  MAYA
                    I ll see you tomorrow.

      Emily watches Maya walk into the house.  As she turns to 
      leave, a BLACK SEDAN slowly drives along side her.  The 
      windows are tented very dark.  Unnerved, Emily picks up her 
      pace.  The car speeds up to meet her pace.  At the 
      intersection, Emily turns right.  The car turns left.  
      Relieved, Emily smiles at her misguided paranoia.  


      INT. ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - DAY 

      Emily, wearing her one piece Speedo, stretches near the pool.  
      Her boyfriend, BEN (16) grabs her from behind.  He also wears 
    a Speedo.  It shows off his swimmer s body and six-pack-abs.                                                                                     38.



                                  BEN
                    Where did you go after school?  I 
                    was looking for you.

      She s not sure why but she lies -

                                  EMILY
                    I was around.

      He grabs her again.  Kisses her.  There is no softness to 
      him.  Just teenage boy fervor.  

                                  BEN
                    I missed you.  

      The swim COACH blows her WHISTLE.    

                                  COACH
                    Let s do a 100 meter sprint.  I 
                    want it smooth and fast.  First 
                    team on your marks.   

      Ben and Emily assume their starting positions by the pool.  
      Ben glances over at Emily and winks.  She smiles.  Then the 
      coach blows her WHISTLE and they dive into the water.  

      Ben and Emily both take quick leads over the rest of the 
      swimmers.  TEAMMATES walk along the side of the pool and 
      cheer them on.  The girls yell for Emily.  The boys holler 
      for Ben.  

      Emily reaches the end of the pool first.  She looks up to see 
      who won.  The coach gives her the answer -

                                  COACH
                    Awesome effort, Em.  Keep that up 
                    and you ll be medaling at state.  

      Emily swims over to Ben.  Reaches to hug him. 

                                  EMILY
                    Good race -

                                  BEN
                    It s called practice, Emily.  Not a 
                    meet.

      A sore loser, he pushes her away and swims off.  Emily looks 
      at him.  He successfully made her feel like crap.                                                                                    39.




      INT. ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - GIRLS LOCKER ROOM - EVENING

      After their practices, the Rosewood jocks hang out and gossip 
      in the communal showers.  Emily wraps a towel around herself 
      and leaves the showers for her locker.  Just then, Spencer 
      walks in from field hockey practice.  Their lockers are 
      directly across from each other.   

                                    SPENCER
                    Have you been hanging with Aria?

                                  EMILY
                    Not really.

      Emily opens her locker and a piece of paper falls out.  She 
      picks it up and reads the note which was handwritten on graph 
      paper. 

      CLOSE ON NOTE: Hey Em, Sob!  I ve been replaced.  You ve 
      found another friend to kiss! - A

      For a second, Emily stops breathing.  Spencer reads the look 
      of distress on her face. 

                                    SPENCER
                    Emily?  Is everything alright?

                                  EMILY
                    Why wouldn t it be?

      She closes her locker.  Spencer shrugs as she watches Emily 
      walk away.

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    40.



                                  ACT FOUR


      EXT. SPENCER S PATIO - NIGHT

      On the warm summer night, Spencer, wearing a bikini that 
      leaves little to the imagination, relaxes in the jacuzzi.  
      She looks up when she hears -  

                                  WREN (O.S.)
                    Oh.  

      Wren stands above her, naked except for his sexy, boxer-brief 
      underwear.  

                                  WREN
                    I ll come back. 

                                    SPENCER
                    It s a big jacuzzi.  

      He drops his towel and steps into the water.  

                                    SPENCER
                    I thought you guys were moving in 
                    next week.  

                                  WREN
                    Melissa thought we should get 
                    settled before classes start.  

      She massages her shoulder.  

                                  WREN
                    Tough day at school?

                                    SPENCER
                    Tough field hockey practice.

                                  WREN
                    I rowed for Oxford.

                                    SPENCER
                    That looks good on a Med School 
                    app.

                                  WREN
                    I did it because I loved it.

      She massages her shoulder again.                                                                                      41.



                                  WREN
                    You probably have some fluid build 
                    up in your bursa sac.

                                    SPENCER
                    I bet you say that to all the 
                    girls.

                                  WREN
                    I can help.   

                                    SPENCER
                    Okay, Doctor Wren -

      He reaches over and massages her shoulder.  She relaxes into 
      it.

                                  WREN
                    Better, right?  

                                    SPENCER
                    Wow, that s awesome.

      He massages a little deeper.  She releases a pleased moan.  
      His hand reaches to the front of her shoulder.  Near her 
      chest.

                                    MELISSA (O.S.)
                    Wren? 

      He immediately backs away from Spencer.  They both know how 
      it looks.  Spencer climbs out of the jacuzzi.  She doesn t 
      say a word.  As Melissa approaches from the barn, Spencer 
      slips inside the main house.  


      INT. FIELDS HOUSE - STAIRWELL - DINING ROOM - EVENING 

      Emily and her father, ROBERT, walk down the stairs together.  
        A successful Rosewood dentist, Robert makes an effort to stay 
      a part of his teenage daughter s life.   

                                  ROBERT
                    How was practice?

                                  EMILY
                    Fine.

                                  ROBERT
                    Just fine?

                                  EMILY
                    I beat Ben in the freestyle.                                                                                    42.



                                  ROBERT
                    That s great.

      They sit at the dining room table.

                                  EMILY
                    He s totally mad at me.   

                                  ROBERT
                    Do you want me to talk to him?

      Pam carries in a platter of food.  

                                  PAM
                    Who?

                                  ROBERT
                    Emily out-swam Ben today.

                                  PAM
                    Not the best way to win a young 
                    man s affections.  

      As Pam serves dinner Robert secretly tosses Emily a  good 
      work  thumbs up.  She smiles at him.  Pam sits at the table 
      and the tone turns to mundane as they eat.  After a long 
      moment of silence.

                                  ROBERT
                    Did you do something different with 
                    the pot roast?

      Pam is excited that he noticed -

                                  PAM
                    Yes, I used paprika instead of 
                    black pepper.  

                                  ROBERT
                    It s a subtle change but I like it.  

                                  PAM
                    Mongolian paprika, not Hungarian. 

      Emily looks at them.  It s a  who gives a shit  look.

                                  EMILY
                    May I be excused?  I have a lot of 
                    homework.

                                  ROBERT
                            (contemplating)
                    Mongolian paprika...                                                                                    43.



                                  PAM
                    Yes, you may be excused.

      Emily stands and takes her plate to the sink.  

                                  ROBERT
                    Do you need any help? 

                                  EMILY
                    Thanks, Dad, I ve got it covered. 


      EXT. FIELDS HOME - FRONT PORCH - EVENING 

      Emily takes her Lit book to the white porch swing.  As she 
      sits on the swing Emily opens the book.  She pulls out the 
      note she found in her locker.  As she rereads it she feels 
      like throwing up. 


      INT. SPENCER S ROOM - NIGHT

      The sound of Melissa GIGGLING turns Spencer s attention to 
      her bedroom window.  She looks out to see - 

      Melissa and Wren are now in the jacuzzi together.  They kiss.  
      It s sexy.  Spencer continues to watch.  We hear -  

                                  COMPUTER (O.S.)
                    You ve got mail.

      Spencer tears her eyes from the make-out session and clicks 
      onto her  new mail  icon.  CLOSE ON E-MAIL: The subject line 
      reads: SATvocab.  Then below the subject: Spencer, COVET is 
      an easy one.  When someone COVETS something, they desire and 
      lust after it.  Usually, it s something they can t have.  
      You ve always had that problem, though, haven t you? - A

      Spencer immediately looks out her window.  Who could see her?  
      Who was watching her?  Melissa and Wren are still in the 
      jacuzzi.  Spencer looks over at Alison s old house.  The 
      Victorian is directly across the lawn. 


      INT. HASTINGS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 

      This flashback is shot entirely in Spencer s POV. It s the 
      year 2006 and another bright summer day. Spencer, Hanna and 
      Alison (all 13 years old) are in the scene.  But we only see 
      Alison, who wears a bathing suit.  We (Spencer) look on as 
      Alison scolds Hanna.                                                                                    44.



                                  ALISON
                    Are you really going to eat that? 

      Alison makes a  fat girl face.    

                                  ALISON
                    I m being a friend, Hanna.  

      Hanna s hand replaces the cookie onto a serving tray.

      MELISSA (16) walks in with her cute boyfriend IAN THOMAS 
      (16).  They are the  it couple  at Rosewood High.  

                                    MELISSA
                    Aren t you supposed to be at 
                    Alison s?  

                                  IAN
                    Hi, girls.

                                  ALISON
                    Hi, Ian.  

      He looks at Spencer.  

                                  IAN
                    Do you still need help with your 
                    scoop, Spence?  I ve got my stick 
                    in the car.

                                    MELISSA
                    Ian!  What are you?  Her baby 
                    sitter? 

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -


      EXT. HASTINGS HOUSE - DAY 

      Still Spencer s POV. - Spencer follows Alison out of the 
      house.

                                  ALISON
                    You kissed your sister s boyfriend, 
                    Spencer.  It s going to haunt you 
                    until you make it right.    

      Spencer turns back to see Hanna who is just out of view from 
      the window.  When her  friend Alison  isn t looking, Hanna s 
      hand reaches for the cookie. 

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO:                                                                                    45.



                                  ALISON 
                    Either you tell her, or I do.

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO:

      Spencer s hand has a tight grip on Alison s arm.

                                  ALISON
                    Is that a threat, Spencer?

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO:

                                  ALISON
                    You have as much to lose as I do.  
                    We both know you d never tell about 
                     the Jenna thing.      

      Off of Alison s spiteful look WE CUT BACK TO -


      INT. HASTINGS HOUSE - SPENCER S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

      Present day.  Spencer stares out her bedroom window.  She 
      notices something in Alison s old room.  It looked like a 
      flash of blonde hair.  The exact shade of Alison s hair.  
      Thrown, Spencer utters a whisper -

                                    SPENCER
                    Alison?

                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    46.



                                  ACT FIVE


      INT. MONTGOMERY HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT 

      The doorbell RINGS.  Byron walks to the front door and opens 
      it.  He is surprised and pleased to see Emily standing on 
      their front porch.

                                  BYRON
                    Emily Fields, look at you.  I know 
                    you re sixteen now but I was still 
                    thinking of you as a middle school 
                    girl.

                                  EMILY
                    Hello, Mister Montgomery, I mean 
                    Byron.

                                  BYRON
                          (calling out)
                    Aria, Emily s here!
                          (turning back to Emily)
                    Now, it s starting to feel like old 
                    times.

      Aria walks into the room.

                                  ARIA
                    We left old times, remember?  

                                  BYRON
                    Yes, Aria.  I remember.  
                          (turning back to Emily)
                    It s good to see you, Emily.  

                                  EMILY
                    Thanks.  You, too.  

      Aria steps outside. 


      EXT. MONTGOMERY HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 

      Aria and Emily are alone on the porch.

                                  EMILY
                    I m sorry for just stopping by.

                                  ARIA
                    Anytime, Em.  You know that.                                                                                    47.



                                  EMILY
                    Somebody left a note in my locker.

      Aria reads Emily s worried tone -

                                  ARIA
                    From  A? 

                                  EMILY
                    You, too?

                                  ARIA
                    Do you really think it s her?  Is 
                    it possible?

                                  EMILY
                    Only Alison could have known -

      Emily hesitates.

                                  ARIA
                    Known what?  

                                  EMILY
                    It was...

      Aria reads Emily s reluctance -

                                  ARIA
                    Personal?

                                  EMILY
                    I really believed she was dead.  

                                  ARIA
                    We all did.  

      Behind Emily - The shade is drawn, but Aria notices the light 
      in her father s den turn on. 

                                  EMILY
                    Could she really be back? 

      Aria locks eyes with Emily.

                                  ARIA
                    I think she s playing with us.     

                                  EMILY
                    Why would she do that?                                                                                         48.



                                  ARIA
                    We re talking about Alison here.  
                    Wasn t that her favorite sport?

                                  EMILY
                    Should we tell someone?  

      As Byron walks across his den, his shadow crosses the window 
      shade.

                                  ARIA
                    I don t know about you, but I 
                    can t.

      Emily thinks about her message from  A. 

                                  EMILY
                    I m glad you re back. 

                                  ARIA
                    It s funny.  Even though I grew up 
                    here, I feel like a total outsider.  

                                  EMILY
                    Me, too.

      Off of Aria s surprised look WE CUT TO:


      INT. MARIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

      Hanna and her mother, Ashley, eat dinner together.   

                                  ASHLEY
                    I ran into Ella Montgomery today.  
                    Why didn t you tell me Aria was 
                    back?

                    So change the story.  I did.

      Ashley gives her a curious look.  Hanna delivers a convincing 
        performance.                                                                                    49.



                                  HANNA
                    You grew up.  You grew apart.  It 
                    was mutual.  You have family money.  
                    You work because you want to.  And 
                    honestly, we re happier without 
                    him. 

                                  ASHLEY
                    Hanna.

                                  HANNA
                    Say it enough and you actually 
                    start to believe it.  

                                  ASHLEY
                    I have to admit, it does sound 
                    better than the truth.  

                                  HANNA
                    Nobody needs to know we got dumped.

                                  ASHLEY
                    And that your father took 
                      everything.

                                  HANNA
                    And that the extent of your 
                    family s assets is a double wide 
                    parked in Alabama.

      Ashley laughs.  They cheer each other up.  Hanna s BlackBerry 
      BEEPS, signaling she received a text.

                                  ASHLEY
                    If that s Mona, I m arranging for 
                    an intervention.  

      Hanna looks down at her phone.  CLOSE ON TEXT - It s from 
      Spencer and reads: WE NEED TO TALK!!!

                                  ASHLEY
                    Hanna, we re eating.  

      Just then Ashley s BlackBerry RINGS.  Hanna offers her mother 
      a cagey smile.  Ashley looks at her screen.  She is annoyed 
      to be bothered but answers the business call. 

                                  ASHLEY
                    This is Ashley -

      The doorbell RINGS.  Ashley s look to Hanna says  What now?                                                                                        50.



      Hanna leaves the kitchen and walks to the front door.  She 
      peeks through the peephole to see who it is.  She seems taken 
      aback.  Hanna hesitates.  The BELL rings again and she opens 
      the door.  

      OFFICER DARREN WILDEN (25) stands on her front porch.  Darren 
      was the Rosewood High School party boy and player of his day.  
      Now he s a cop.   

                                  WILDEN
                    Hanna Marin?

                                  HANNA
                    Yeah, why?

                                  WILDEN
                    Is your mother home?

      Still on her call, Ashley enters the room.  She sees Wilden 
      at the door.

                                  ASHLEY
                    I need to call you back.  

      She hangs up the phone and stands next to Hanna.  

                                  ASHLEY
                    What s this about?

                                  WILDEN
                    We received a call from the 
                    Rosewood Mall security.  They have 
                    your daughter on tape shoplifting a 
                    pair of sunglasses.

                                  ASHLEY
                    I m sure there s been a mistake.

      He removes a pair of handcuffs from his belt.  Hanna looks to 
      her mom.  She is suddenly 16 going on 12.

                                  HANNA
                    Mom?


      INT. ROSEWOOD POLICE STATION - NIGHT 

      Hanna sits handcuffed to a chair.  The door to Wilden s 
      office is open.  Hanna looks over to see her mother sitting 
      across the desk from Wilden.  Ashley crosses her legs and her 
      skirt rides up her thigh.  A beat later, Wilden closes the 
      door to his office.                                                                                      51.



      Hanna eyes a bowl of M&M s on the desk next to her.  She 
        contemplates grabbing a handful.  She reaches for the candy 
      but stops short when - 

      Hanna s phone BUZZES.  She opens her bag and pulls out her 
      BlackBerry.  She reads the text: Be careful, Hanna.  I hear 
      prison food makes you fat. - A 

      Hanna looks up from her phone.  Off of her alarmed look we 
      FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    52.



                                  ACT SIX


      INT. ROSEWOOD POLICE STATION - NIGHT 

      Hanna sits quietly on the bench.  A POLICE OFFICER rushes 
      past her.  Hanna notices a sudden barrage of activity.  

      The door to Wilden s office opens.  He walks out and heads 
      toward Hanna.  He doesn t say a word as he unlocks her 
      handcuffs.  He attaches the cuffs to his belt as he walks out 
      of the station.   

      Ashley walks over to Hanna.

                                  HANNA
                    What s going on?  

                                  ASHLEY
                    Let s go.  

                                  HANNA
                    Really?  

      Ashley gives her a look - It says  get your ass moving.   
      Hanna grabs her bag and follows her mother out of the 
      station.  


      EXT. ROSEWOOD POLICE STATION - NIGHT 

      Ashley walks down the front steps of the building with Hanna 
      on her heels.  Up ahead, WE SEE Wilden climb into a police 
      cruiser.  He hits the LIGHTS as he speeds away.  

      Hanna is desperate to know what happened but is smart enough 
      to keep her mouth shut.  She silently follows her mother to 
      their new Mercedes Benz.  Ashley unlocks the car and they 
      both climb inside. 


      INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT 

      Ashley drives away from the station.  Another cop car speeds 
      past the Mercedes.  After a deafening silence - 

                                  ASHLEY
                    In a small town like this, what 
                    people think about you matters.   

                                  HANNA
                    I know.                                                                                    53.



                                  ASHLEY
                    Then why would you risk it all to 
                    steal a pair of sunglasses?  Jesus 
                    Hanna, I buy you everything you 
                    need to be popular.    

                                  HANNA
                    I made a mistake.

                                  ASHLEY
                    In Rosewood, you don t have room to 
                    make a mistake.  And neither do I.

                                  HANNA
                    I m sorry.  I ll fix it somehow.

                                  ASHLEY
                    You ll deny you did anything wrong.  
                    It was a misunderstanding. 

                                  HANNA
                    But -  

      Ashley looks over at her daughter.

                                  ASHLEY
                    I m taking care of it.

      Ashley turns her attention back to the road.  Her tone 
      suggests this conversation is over - for good.  

      Hanna glances down at her BlackBerry.  She reads the text 
      from  A  then scrolls up to Spencer s message which reads: We 
      need to talk!!!

      Hanna types a response: About  A ?  She sends the text. 


      EXT. ROSEWOOD NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 

      Emily walks home.  An ambulance, SIREN SCREAMING, buzzes past 
      her.  Emily rounds the corner and stops in her tracks.  She 
      can t believe what she sees. 

      Police cars (lights flashing) flood the street.  DOZENS of 
      NEIGHBORS and TOWNSPEOPLE stand around, watching and 
      wondering.  POLICE OFFICERS move a barricade and the 
      ambulance pulls into Maya s driveway.

                                  EMILY
                    Maya -                                                                                    54.



      Emily panics.  She pushes through the swarm of people.  
      Scanning the crowd for Maya s face, she finally reaches the 
      front walk of the old Victorian. 

                                  MAYA (O.S.)
                    Emily!

      Emily turns - she s relieved to see Maya making her way 
      toward her.  They give each other a spontaneous hug.  

                                  EMILY
                    I thought something might have 
                    happened to you.  

                                  MAYA
                    I tried to call you.  

                                  EMILY
                    What s going on?

                                  MAYA
                    They found your friend.   

      The news doesn t surprise her. 

                                  EMILY
                    I knew she was back.

      Emily looks past Maya.

                                  EMILY
                    Is she inside?  

                                  MAYA
                    Emily -

      Just then the CORONER wheels a gurney around the side of the 
      house.  The deceased is zipped in a body bag.  

                                  MAYA
                    I m sorry.  They found Alison s 
                    body.  

      The CROWD buzzes with a disturbed sadness as Alison s body is 
      wheeled toward the coroner s van.  A bewildered Emily stares 
      at the body bag in disbelief. 


      INT. HONDA ACCORD - NIGHT 

      Aria drives.  She slows to a crawl.  Police cars line the 
      road.  A news van, parked in the middle of the road, blocks 
      her path.  Aria parks the car and climbs out.                                                                                    55.




      EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

      Aria walks away from her car, heading toward the scene.  She 
      looks over towards the Hastings house.  She sees Spencer 
      watching from her driveway.   


      EXT. HASTINGS HOUSE - NIGHT 

      Spencer, alone, watches the scene from her front lawn.  She 
      glances over and sees Aria walking up the long drive.  
      Surprising even herself, Spencer almost cries.  They silently 
      take it all in. 

      In the sea of strange faces, Aria sees Hanna standing with 
      the crowd.  

                                  ARIA
                    I heard the cops took Hanna to the 
                    police station today.

      Spencer, with steel eyes, turns to Aria.  

                                    SPENCER
                    She d never talk about -

      Hanna overhears them as she approaches from the driveway -

                                  HANNA
                    -  The Jenna thing?   

      Startled, Spencer and Aria turn to her.

                                  HANNA
                    We made a promise.


      INT. MARIN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 

      The house is dark.  Only the light of the television 
      illuminates the room.  Hanna is curled up on the sofa.  She 
      eats ice cream from the container as she watches the news.

      ON TELEVISION: A reporter delivers her story.  

                                  REPORTER

                    terms with a killer at large in 
                    Rosewood.    

      Hanna hears a THUD at the front door.  Startled, she quickly 
      mutes the television.  

      The front door knob RATTLES.  Hanna coils on the sofa.  A 
      beat later the door opens.  In the darkness we see shadows 
      push into the house.  Two people in a struggle.  They push 
      into a beam of moonlight.  

      Hanna finally realizes that it s her mother as Ashley is 
      shoved against the wall.  Then the other person moves into 
      the light.  It s Wilden.  He leans in and kisses Ashley.  She 
      kisses him back.  

      Ashley leads Wilden toward the bedroom.  Before closing the 
      door, she notices Hanna.  Ashley gives Hanna a look that 
      says,  I m doing this for us.   She closes the door.

      News vans line the street as a flood of PEOPLE make their way

      INT. ROSEWOOD CHAPEL - DAY 

      The Montgomery s walk into a crowded chapel.  It s too much 
      for Aria.  She turns to her mother.  

                                  ARIA
                    I think I need some air.  I ll find

                    I m okay.  

      Aria heads back to the entrance.  It is jammed with people 
      walking in.  She s trapped.  She opens the door to the 
      rectory and escapes inside.


      INT. ROSEWOOD CHAPEL - RECTORY - DAY 

      Aria walks over to an open window and stares outside.  

                                  EZRA (O.S.)
                    Was she a friend?

      Aria turns to see Ezra standing in the doorway.  He steps 
      into the office and closes the door.  They are alone.

                                  ARIA
                    Do you care?

                                  EZRA
                    I m not sure what I feel worse 
                    about.  Having to stay away from 
                    you or being a jerk about it.   

      Aria softens.  

                                  ARIA
                    She was one of my best friends.

                                  EZRA
                    I m sorry.  

                                  ARIA
                    For Alison or for being a jerk?                                                                                    58.



                                  EZRA
                    Both.  

                                  ARIA
                    Thank you.

      She s so assured.  Poised.

                                  EZRA
                    How can you only be sixteen?  

                                  ARIA
                    It s just a number.  It doesn t 
                    define me.  

                                  EZRA
                    There just can t be a happy ending 
                    for us.  

                                  ARIA
                      I understand.  

      She looks at him with those beckoning eyes.  

                                  ARIA
                    I would never want to do anything 
                    that would get you into trouble.  

      She walks toward him.  Gives him the slightest of kisses on 
      the cheek.  Lets her body lightly brush up against his.

                                  ARIA
                    Goodbye, Ezra.

      She turns to leave.  He can t let her go.  Ezra grabs her 
      wrist.  Pulls her close.  They search each other s eyes.  
      Tease each other with almost kisses.  Then they give in to 
      the moment - it s intense, exciting, passionate.   

      After a moment she gently pulls back from him.  Hopefully 
      playing it right, she decides to be the one who leaves this 
      time.  She brushes a wisp of hair from his forehead then 
      quietly leaves the rectory. 


      INT. ROSEWOOD CHAPEL - SANCTUARY - DAY 

      Aria enters the sanctuary.  She sees MR. & MRS. DiLAURENTIS 
      (38), both wearing black, talking with GUESTS.  She walks up 
      to them.  

                                  ARIA
                    Mrs. DiLaurentis?                                                                                    59.



      She turns to see Aria and a smile comes across her face.

                                  MRS. DILAURENTIS
                    Aria.  

      They hug.

                                  MRS. DILAURENTIS
                    I m glad you came.  I asked the 
                    other girls to sit together up 
                    front.  It s what Alison would have 
                    wanted.

                                  ARIA
                    Of course.

      Aria walks down the center aisle, toward the front of the 
      sanctuary.  She passes by Mona... Ben... Wren and Melissa... 
      and Noel, who notices Aria as she passes by him.    

      Aria nears the closed casket with Alison s photograph perched 
      on top of it.  The reality of the moment hits her hard.  She 
      stands frozen.  A hand reaches up to hold hers.  Aria looks 
      down.  It s Hanna, reaching out to her.  Emily and Spencer 
      also look to their friend.  

      Aria scoots in next to Hanna.  In a moment of solidarity, 
      they all join hands.  They look at the casket and the 
      photograph.

                                  EMILY
                    Poor, Ali. 

                                  HANNA
                    Can you believe what a scene this 
                    is?  

                                  ARIA
                    Alison would have loved it.  

                                    SPENCER
                    Popular in life and death.

      Hanna notices that Emily is just barely holding it together.  
      Hanna reaches into her bag and pulls out a flask.  She hands 
      it to Emily who waves it away.

                                  EMILY
                    No thanks. I don t - 

                                  HANNA
                    I think today you do -                                                                                    60.



      Aria s phone BUZZES.  All the girls turn to her as Aria looks 
      down at the text.  

                                  HANNA
                    Anyone we know?  

                                  ARIA
                    Just my mom - Texting me from the 
                    back.  

      Aria places the phone back into her bag.  When she looks up 
      she sees that each of her friends is looking at her.  She 
      reads their uneasiness.   

                                  ARIA
                    Emily and I aren t the only one s 
                    who got messages from  A,  are we?  

      A CHATTER BUZZ fills the sanctuary.  Spencer turns to see 
      what s happening.  She looks on in disbelief - 

                                    SPENCER
                     Oh my God.

      CAMERA FINDS a stunningly beautiful sixteen-year-old GIRL who 
      stands at the back of the chapel.  Her eyes are hidden behind 
      a pair of large framed, dark sunglasses.  As her BROTHER 
      leads her down the aisle, we realize she is blind.

      Spencer s face reads absolute dismay -

                                    SPENCER
                    It s Jenna.

      The other girls stiffen at the sound of the name.  Dreading 
      what their eyes will reveal, they turn and follow Spencer s 
      gaze.    

      With long black hair and a model-perfect face, JENNA MARSHALL 
      is drop dead gorgeous.  Her brother, TOBY(17) is good looking 
      but projects an attitude that reads,  stay away.   As they 
      sit, Toby looks to the front of the room.  He sees the four 
      girls sitting together and stares at them.  A disgusted look 
      settles across his face.

      The four girls slowly turn back to face Alison s coffin.  
      They each look like they are guilty of something.  

      Alison s parents sit next to the girls.                                                                                    61.



                                  MRS. DILAURENTIS
                    Did you see that Jenna Marshall was 
                    here?  I didn t realize she and Ali 
                    were friends.  

                                    SPENCER
                    They weren t.

      The MINISTER approaches the podium.

                                  MINISTER
                    The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh 
                    away.

      Spencer and Aria both sneak looks back to Jenna as WE CUT TO -


      EXT. ROSEWOOD CHAPEL - DAY 

      Mourners leave the chapel.  Emily, Spencer, Aria, and Hanna 
      all walk out together.  Officer Wilden approaches them.  He 
      wears a dark suit.  He looks them over -

                                  WILDEN
                    Emily, Spencer, Aria and Hanna.  

      Hanna avoids his gaze and looks down at the ground.  

                                    SPENCER
                    Do we know you? 

      As he reaches into his breast pocket the girls get a glimpse 
      of his gun.  He pulls out a business card and hands it to 
      Spencer.  

                                  WILDEN
                    I m Officer Wilden.  I understand 
                    you were all good friends with the 
                    victim.  

                                  ARIA
                    We were.

                                  WILDEN
                    I m going to need to talk with each 
                    of you.  

                                    SPENCER
                    We talked to the police when Alison 
                    went missing.                                                                                     62.



                                  WILDEN
                    And I intend to go over every one 
                    of your statements.  This is no 
                    longer a missing persons 
                      investigation.  It s a murder.  And 
                    you can be assured, I will find out 
                    what happened that summer.   

      He walks away as Jenna and Toby exit the chapel.  Toby guides 
      Jenna to a waiting car.  Emily sets her eyes on the black 
      sedan with tinted windows.  Was that the car following her?    

      The girls watch Jenna leave.  For a few seconds they forget 
      to breathe.  Aria notices Wilden watching them.  

                                  ARIA
                    Do you think he knows about...  

                                    SPENCER
                    No.

                                  HANNA
                    How could he?  

      Emily looks over at Wilden.  When she catches his stare he 
      finally looks away.  Just then Spencer s Sidekick VIBRATES.  
      Hanna s BlackBerry BUZZES.  Aria s phone RINGS and Emily s 
      plays a RINGTONE.

      They all look down at their screens.

                                  ARIA
                    Oh my God -
