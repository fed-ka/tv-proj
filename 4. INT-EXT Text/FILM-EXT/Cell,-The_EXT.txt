Situated in a corporate/industrial area north of San Diego,
California, a series of well-secured buildings form a mini
compound.
A sign near the gate reads CAMPBELL CENTER - A
DIVISION OF SUNERSET INDUSTRIES.
A GREEN FORD PICK-UP TRUCK cruises down this deserted stretch
of two-lane blacktop, the driver carefully maintaining the
speed limit.
He signals and exits...
The truck rumbles along a stretch of bumpy, unpaved road.
The area is desolate, depressing, and deserted.
It feels
like no one's been anywhere near here for years.
The pick-up
stops at a RUSTED GATE and the DRIVER, a tall, lean, sinewy
fellow undoes a combination lock-and-chain.
We do not yet
see his face.
The truck parks inside a charred barn, now hidden from view,
and the driver steps out, followed by his DOG.
A magnificent WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD.
We notice a GLINT in
its BLUE EYES - the animal's an albino.
The driver points
and whistles.
Well-trained, the Shepard sprints to the gate
and waits, keeping a watchful eye on the road.
Small and isolated, the nearest neighbor a block away.
And we find ourselves in the DESERT of EDWARD'S WORLD.
We fly over dunes and come up behind Catherine as she
struggles through waves of sand.
The tree trunk is up ahead
and we glimpse someone hiding inside.
Catherine reaches.
MOCKEY-LOCK ERUPTS FROM WITHIN THE TREE
TRUNK!
SNARLING!
Catherine retreats, silently screaming.
A railroad bridge and highway span an almost-bone-dry creek
bed.
Gathered beneath the overpass are the POLICE, CORONER,
CRIMINIALISTS, AND A LOCAL FBI.
A SEDAN travels down a
service road and stops nearby.
TWO MEN exit, identify
themselves as FBI and move to the crime scene.
Special Agent GORDON RAMSEY is well-groomed, prides himself
on professionalism, and follows the Bureau party line.
Special Agent PETER NOVAK is rough around the edges,
introspective, and intense.
A loner who marches to the tune
of a peculiar drummer, he's unconventionally handsome with
probing eyes.
He moves slowly, observing the scene - the
world, for that matter - from a unique perspective.
As Ramsey finds the FBI's local liaison - AGENT COLE - Novak
oblivious to the people around him, touches dirt, smells the
air, and examines road, river, bridge and sky.
RAMSEY
Who found her?
Cole nods at a visibly shaken WORKMAN seated in a patrol car.
COLE
Surveyor for the railroad... 'Bout six
this morning.
Novak sees a FEMALE BODY wrapped in plastic and bound by
wire.
Supervising the examination of the woman is FBI
PATHOLOGIST DR. THEODORE "TEDDY" LEE, a polite, dapper
southern gentleman.
NOVAK
Thanks for waiting, Teddy.
Teddy gives Novak a friendly, respectful salute - "My
pleasure."
Novak dons gloves, nods to an FBI PHOTOGRAPHER
and assists Teddy Lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick
clear plastic.
As the photographer reacts to a strong smell,
Teddy comments.
TEDDY LEE
Bleach.
As the man snaps pictures, Ramsey and Cole join them.
Sadly,
Novak recognizes the face.
NOVAK
Anne Marie Vicksey.
We recognize her, too.
COLE
She the one from Santa Cruz?
NOVAK
Just graduated law school.
Single mom.
Had a two-year-old daughter.
He and Teddy expose the bleached flesh of her torso, neither
man surprised.
Coldly thorough, Novak finds another of the
killer's tell-tale signs.
NOVAK (CONT'D)
(instructing the photographer)
The semen on her legs and abdomen.
FLASH! Photos are taken.
TEDDY LEE
Someone looking after her little girl?
NOVAK
Grandparents.
Live over in Davis.
Novak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying
to imagine the horrors she beheld.
He moves to the creek and
sees only a few inches of water.
His eyes move from the drop
site to the highway above.
TEDDY LEE
The poor thing.
FLASH!
We're up there now, ON THE OVERPASS, with the
photographer and Novak, examining TIRE TRACKS in the soft
shoulder.
Novak peers over the edge at the crime scene,
steps back, and focuses on the highway - imagining the
killer's truck as it disappeared into the night.
A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN, JULIA HICKSON, shares lunch with her
fiancee, JOHN TRACY.
They talk, laugh and kiss, not a care
in the world.
Ramsey and Novak exit a small jet and are met by FBI Agent
STOCKWELL.
STOCKWELL
Ramsey, Novak?
They nod and he directs them to a waiting GMC SUBURBAN.
STOCKWELL (CONT'D)
Agent Stockwell.
NOVAK
Where is he?
STOCKWELL
Edison.
Just east of Loma Park.
SWAT's
had the house under surveillance for
about twenty minutes.
(info memorized)
Suspect is Carl Rudolph Stargher.
No
registered weapons, no priors.
Got a
license for his dog, though.
Named him
Valentine...
A sparsely populated lower-middle class neighborhood.
A half
dozen plain houses at the end of a cul-de-sac.
Bare trees.
Brown lawns.
Crows in the air.
The house furthest from the main road has a white Ford F250
pick-up in the driveway.
Green trim.
THE SUBURBAN, hidden from Stargher's house, four-wheels it
through a prairie and stops outside the backyard of a
PRESCHOOL, where two more Suburbans and a van already wait.
Quiet.
Calm.
And then we catch a glimpse of a FIGURE
advancing, using any cover he can, until he is right outside
the house.
The sneaky SWAT team member, ERICSON, whispers
into his throat mic.
ERICSON
I'm at the back door.
BROCK (V.O.)
(in Ericson's earpiece)
Check the kitchen.
Ericson maneuvers his way to the kitchen window and uses a
MIRROR to sneak a peek.
In the REFLECTION we see a
motionless man lying on the floor.
ERICSON
I have a man down.
Repeat, man down.
BROCK (V.O.)
Stargher?
Ericson chances a quick visual check and pops his head up
before reporting.
ERICSON
Can't see his face.
The SWAT TEAM SWARMS towards the house.
As an AMBULANCE emerges from a hiding place behind another
garage, we FOLLOW NOVAK and RAMSEY as they run from the
preschool into the house.
FBI AGENTS and local police cordon off the area.
The ship's engine ROARS TO LIFE and the PROPELLER spins
through sand.
CATHERINE (O.S.)
It's fixed!
AT THE TREE TRUNK, Catherine extends her hand and suddenly
Edward is there, quite close, reaching out.
Catherine's hand
trembles.
The boy is startled.
CATHERINE (CONT'D)
(surprised, to herself)
I'm not signalling...
Her hand tenses and shakes uncontrollably.
VOICE (O.S.)
Sing a song of sixpence...
CATHERINE
(angry, to the heavens)
I'm not signalling!
Edward is frightened by what's happening and runs away.
Catherine tries to call out, but her throat constricts,
making speech difficult.
CATHERINE (CONT'D)
I'm not...
WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP.
A HELICOPTER descends onto the pad.
A stretcher is removed from the side door of the helicopter.
A ready-and-waiting HELICOPTER is on the pad.
Novak races
out of the Center, Ramsey right behind him, SHOUTING at each
other in order to hear above the chopper noise.
RAMSEY
Pete, listen to me.
What did you really
learn in there?
Anything new?
You
really think Stargher gave you a save
the-day clue?
What if this is all some
kind of trick your head is playing on
you?
He won't consider that.
Novak climbs into the helicopter and
buckles himself in.
He looks to Ramsey - you coming? -
Ramsey pats the side of the chopper and signals for the pilot
to take off.
Cole and a handful of other agents pour into waiting
Suburbans.
(INTERCUT WITH NOVAK IN HELICOPTER).
COLE
The hoist was manufactured by Carver
Industrial Equipment in 1982.
Serial
number 117-337J.
Purchased by a boat
shop in Lake Havasu, but sold to
Lattimer's industrial Supply in 1992...
The helicopter lands and Novak jumps out.
He knows this is
the place.
He runs into the barn, but there's nothing, no
sign of her.
The pilot looks at him with a true sense of
loss.
Fighting exhaustion and the side effects of the drugs, Novak
pushes on.
Think, Peter, think... His eyes find the WATER
TANKS and he SHOUTS at the helicopter.
NOVAK
Cut the engine!
As the motor dies, Novak listens and listens.
There it is.
Water pipes beneath his feet.
And very faintly, a pounding.
He follows the sound, searching the earth.
It's clearer now,
louder.
Novak tosses aside rusted junk and the pilot runs to
assist him.
Together, they expose the entrance to the
underground sanctuary.
Cole's Suburban leads a contingent of FBI vehicles and local
police cars onto the property, sirens blaring.
Two cars parked outside.
An old, quirky Volvo and a Land
Rover.
As Miriam walks to her Land Rover, she sees a government
issue Suburban park on the street and Peter Novak exit.
MIRIAM
Agent Novak.
NOVAK
Dr. Kent.
MIRIAM
You're looking well.
NOVAK
Thanks you.
Six weeks off does a body
good.
(conspiratorially)
I heard she got the approval to try the
reversal with Edward.
MIRIAM
That's a secret.
NOVAK
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am.
We know all, see all...
Novak opens the rear compartment of the Suburban and we hear
something moving inside.
NOVAK (CONT'D)
How's the patient.
MIRIAM
Awaiting his arrival.
NOVAK
What about the cat?
MIRIAM
Completely unaware.
Miriam's pager BEEPS and she hurries to her car.
MIRIAM (CONT'D)
I've got to go.
Good luck.
Novak smiles, waves goodbye, and reaches into the Suburban.
