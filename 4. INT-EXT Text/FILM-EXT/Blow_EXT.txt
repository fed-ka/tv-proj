A majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the
Columbian highlands.
A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and
then another.
WHOOSH.
WHOOSH.
The view changes and tiny
dots appear on the hillside vegetation.
WHOOSH.
CLOSER
We realize the dots are people.
Workers swinging long steel
machetes in slow methodical rhythm.
WHOOSH.
WHOOSH.
WE SEE
the South American Indian MEN clearly now.
Their tar stained
teeth.
Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet.
Their
jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect
the harvest.
Old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized
bales speed along the narrow road.
The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the
leaves.
Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after
armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a
gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire.
The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke
streaks the sky.
Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel
ashes into the pot to cool the solution.
A small twin-engine Cessna is loaded with dozens of duffel
bags and the plane takes off.
The Cessna touches down.
The worksite is busy.
George is amongst other workers,
working a summer job.
As George is taking five, he looks
across the sight to Fred, who is sweeping up debris.
A long
way from being the boss.
George sits with Fred.
It's breaktime and Fred eats from a
lunch box.
GEORGE
There's something out there for me, Dad.
Something different.
Something free
form, you know?
Something for me, and
college just isn't it.
FRED
That's too bad.
You would have been the
first one in the family.
GEORGE
I know.
FRED
Alright.
You want me to get your old
job back?
Because I could, you know, I
could put in that word.
GEORGE
No, Dad.
I don't want to...I mean, I
just don't want...
It's obvious to Fred that his son doesn't want to be like
him.
FRED
What are you going to do?
GEORGE
I'm going to California.

California was like nothing I'd ever

The people were liberated

Ramon tells me you are looking for some

GEORGE
Yes, I am.
Santiago moves to a tarp and pulls it back to reveal many
bales of green, seedless sinsemilla.
SANTIAGO
For instance, something like this?
GEORGE
Very nice.
I'll take it.
SANTIAGO
Ha ha ha.
You are funny.
Really, how
much will you be needing?
GEORGE
All of it.
As much as you've got.
A
couples thousand pounds.
I'll be back
in a week with a plane.
SANTIAGO
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to
meet you, but maybe we are going too
fast.
You take a little and then come
back.
GEORGE
I don't need a little.
I need a lot.
SANTIAGO
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and
I believe in yours, as well.
We must be
careful.
GEORGE
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty
thousand dollars?
Would that eliminate
some of your concerns?
SANTIAGO
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand
dollars, and I have no more concerns.
A pair of boltcutters snaps the chain off a single-engine

TUNA
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
KEVIN
Don't be such a pussy.

It's fine.
We're not stealing it.
We're borrowing it.
And try to look
natural.
We've got company.
A MECHANIC working on the adjacent plane is giving them the
hairy eyeball.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Be cool.
The three boys nod their heads in acknowledgement and give a
small wave.
The mechanic smiles and waves back.
The plane tries to land.
It's a clumsy one.
The Cessna is

sideways before straightening out and stopping.
George and
Kevin hop out of the plane.
They are greeted by Santiago and
the Mexican contingency.
AMIGOS
Hola, George!
Bienvenido!
George hands out presents to everyone.
He's like Santa
Claus, giving gifts to every man, woman and child.

Santiago pumps George's hand.
SANTIAGO
Good to see you, Jorge.
You are a man
of your word.
GEORGE
Actually, I've got some news.
That
fifty thousand I promised you, I
couldn't get it.
George throws Santiago a duffel bag.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
So I brought you sixty.
Rada sits in the Winnebago and keeps flashing the headlights.
Barbara, Tuna, and Maria stand on top of the Winnebago waving

You're pale.
BARBARA
I feel like shit.
Me and my frigging
nosebleeds.
GEORGE
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get
home, and I don't want to hear any
arguments.
BARBARA
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go
to Chicago with you?
GEORGE
No, not at all.
Sure.
You're right.
You fly home and get some rest.
BARBARA
Nice first impression.
A nose bleed in
front of your parents.
GEORGE
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they?
I wanted to shoot myself.
BARBARA
Oh, they weren't that bad.
I mean, they
were kind of cute.
GEORGE
Promise me that we'll never be like
them.
I don't want to wind up like
that.
BARBARA
Relax, baby.
We're going to wind up
like us.
George walks out, free on bond, to find Barbara waiting for
him.
She doesn't look so good.
BARBARA
Surprise.
GEORGE
Baby, you didn't have to come.
BARBARA
What, and miss all the fun?
C'mon, not
a chance.
So, what's the verdict?
GEORGE
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five
years.
I'll serve two.
BARBARA
Two years.
George, I can't wait that
long.
GEORGE
What?
You're not going to wait for me?
BARBARA
George, I went to the doctor.
I don't
have two years.
GEORGE (V.O.)
Which brings me to rule number three:
which says, fuck rules one and two, skip
bail and take off.
George hits the gas and the car screams down the road.
George and Barbara sit on the veranda drinking champagne and

Barbara is

Rail thin, eyes sunken.
But it doesn't matter.
They're having a great time.
They
laugh and hold hands and laugh some more.
Everyone is there.
All in black.
Barbara's casket is
lowered into the ground and George climbs to his knees to
push the first dirt on the grave.
GEORGE (V.O.)
Time is such a funny thing.
I look at
where I am now, and in here, time inches
along.
So slow, it hardly seems like it
moves.
But back then, time went fast.
George pushes dirt along the edge of a flower root.
Still
planting those sunflowers, he presses down firmly, standing
before him is Barbara, still beautiful and young with flowing
locks.
George raises his hand and makes a small wave.
Barbara opens and closes her hand.
Bye bye.
GEORGE
It went too fast.
George looks down and Barbara is gone.
No Barbara.
George hops the fence like he did when he was a boy and goes

The front door opens and FEDERAL AGENTS pour into the house.
They lead George outside in handcuffs.
Ermine and Fred

ERMINE
I had no choice.
George stops and looks at his mother, for the first time
realizing her betrayal.
ERMINE (CONT'D)
Don't look at me like that.
What was I
supposed to do?
You're in our house.
What, was I supposed to be an
accomplice?
As George is led to the police car, Ermine follows.
ERMINE (CONT'D)
You don't think people know you're a
drug dealer?
Everyone knows.
It's no
secret.
How do you think that reflects
on me?
Every time I go out, I'm
humiliated.
I see the stares.
I hear
the whispers.
How do you think that
makes me feel?
Did you ever once stop
and think of me?
George's head is pushed down as he is put in the squad car.
He looks up at his mother.
ERMINE (CONT'D)
So you go to jail.
It's for your own
good.
You need to straighten your life
out.

Fred exits the liquor store carrying two bottles of Dom
Perignon.
As he catches George's eye, he lifts the bottles
showing them off.
George holds up his finger, indicating
he'll be just a second.
DIEGO (CONT'D)
You need to come down here, everybody

Ho ho ho.
Ha ha ha.
We do one for good faith and then we

GEORGE
I can't go anywhere, Diego.
I'm on
parole.
I can't leave the state.
DIEGO
But you must.
It's the only way.
GEORGE
I just got released five minutes ago.
DIEGO
George, are we gonna do this or not?
George steps outside and spots Diego.
Their eyes meet.
Diego looks different, relaxed.
He wears a straw hat,
shorts, and sports a healthy tan.
The two men embrace.
GEORGE
Good to see you, Diego.
DIEGO
Yes.
Look around you.

The

The women.
It's better than
Danbury, no?
Come on.
I have some
friends I would like you to meet.
Diego and George sit with five other Colombians, most
notably, a man named CESAR ROZA.
The mood is not friendly.
DIEGO
Fifteen kilos.
Seven and a half in each
suitcase.
You receive a hundred
thousand dollars upon delivery.
GEORGE
Okay.
CESAR
Not so fast.
I would like to go over
the details.
GEORGE
What details?
I put the coke in the
false bottoms and take it through
customs.
CESAR
Tell me about the suitcases.
What is
the make and the color?
DIEGO
Samsonites.
Red.
No tags.
Cesar thinks about it.
CESAR
Hmm.
I see.
Will there be clothes in
the suitcase?
GEORGE
What?
Yeah, sure.
CESAR
Whose cloths?
Your clothes?
GEORGE
My clothes, your clothes.
What does it
matter?
CESAR
I would like to know the contents.
Every detail is important.
GEORGE
What are we doing here, Diego?
This
guy's a clown.
He's talking about
clothes.
CESAR
I demand to know everything.
I do not
trust six-hundred thousand dollars of
coca to someone I don't know.
GEORGE
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.
I piss
fifteen kilos.
CESAR
The coca is my responsibility!
GEORGE
You're a fucking amateur!
DIEGO
Gentlemen, please.
There is no need to
be impolite.
Cesar, this will be fine.
You have my word.
George, Cesar is just
being thorough.
That's all.
CESAR
Very well.
But just remember, Mr. Jung.
I will be with you the whole way.
And I
will be watching.
George moves to the payphones, sets down the two suitcases,
and pretends to make a call.
Not inconspicuously, Cesar
grabs the bags and walks quickly out of the terminal.
George gets out of a taxi to find SEVERAL COLOMBIAN MEN
hanging around outside an apartment.
He checks the address
and moves over to the men.
GEORGE
I'm George.
Friend of Diego's?
The Colombian men are not impressed.
They grab George and
pull him inside.
SUPERIMPOSE: MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA

The

YOUNG SOLDIERS open the door for George and
roughly usher him over to a Jeep within the confine.
They
frisk him top to bottom.
Diego is leaning against another
Jeep and waits for George to be released.
DIEGO
George, good to see you, my brother.
GEORGE
What the fuck is going on?
When did you
get out of jail?
DIEGO
Pablo used his influence.
Now, George,
watch what you say.
Everybody hears
everything.
A lot of things get said
and done that, well, let's just say this
isn't America.
Life is cheap here, you
know?
No offense, but you know what I'm
saying?
GEORGE
Yeah.
Keep my mouth shut and let you do
the talking.
DIEGO
Right.
Now who is the person in
California?
The connection?
GEORGE
Just a friend.
DIEGO
Who?
I need to know.
Ah, never mind.
We'll talk about it later.
GEORGE
Yeah.
You do the talking.
The sound of a young man, a MALETON, struggling can be heard
in the distance.
From another area, PABLO ESCOBAR emerges.
He is singular in purpose.
He is handed a pistol and moves
quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words.
And
then, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head.
George and Diego, who is visibly shaken, watch.
Escobar is
handed a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his
hands, as he moves back.
LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
He will see you now.
(to Diego)
Not you.
DIEGO
There must be some kind of mistake.
LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
No mistake.
Mr. Escobar will see Mr.
Jung alone.
You are to wait here.
George hesitates.
DIEGO
It's alright, George.
You go.
LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
This way, please.
The large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where
the maleton was just shot.
George looks back at Diego as he
is led away.
ESCOBAR
So, this is the man who takes fifty
kilos and makes them disappear in one
day?
GEORGE
Actually, it was three.
ESCOBAR
The man who gives us the airplanes.
The
man from America.
The mafia.
Chicago.
Boom boom.
Hollywood.
You are going to
open for us the gates of Hollywood,
George?
GEORGE
It would be my pleasure.
ESCOBAR
Good.
Very good.
Welcome, my friend.
Welcome to my country.
Escobar moves over to embrace George.
George returns it, and
their hands come together.
George can't help it.
He
reflexively looks at his hands.
Escobar understands.
ESCOBAR (CONT'D)
The man in the garden.
He was full of
courage.
GEORGE
Un sapo?
ESCOBAR
Un rata - no good.
But he could have
run, fled the country.
Gone to the
policia.
But then his wife, his
children, his parents, his friends, many
people would die.
GEORGE
Yes.
ESCOBAR
But, never mind.
I am thinking we can
do much together.
This problem with
Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very
silly business.
To release him from the
carcel, it causes me much inconvenience.
The fifty kilos could have been a big
problem.
And I don't like problems.
GEORGE
With all respect, Padrino.
Diego is my
partner.
I do not do business without
him.
Escobar looks at him with a cold stare.
But George doesn't
flinch.
His face reveals nothing.
Finally, a smile breaks
across Pablo's lips.
ESCOBAR
I like you, George.
You are loyal.
That is good.
That is rare.
Maybe
crazy.
Yes.
I can tell already.
You
are like me.
I look at you and I see
myself.
It's in the eyes, no, George?
GEORGE
Yes, it is.
ESCOBAR
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine
for me in your country, George?
GEORGE
Yes, sir.
As much as you can give me.
ESCOBAR
As much as I can give you?
Ha ha.
Very
good.
I like that.
Come, George.
Let
us drive.
We have much to talk about.
Diego watches the two men walk outside.
Escobar throws an
arm around George's shoulder.
Pablo hops into a Jeep and
motions for George.
The bodyguards come running.
But Pablo
waves them away.
Escobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it.
Before
them is a stunning panorama.
ESCOBAR
I like to come up here.
To make the
decisions.
To be one with nature.
GEORGE
It's beautiful.
ESCOBAR
People tell me that I am crazy.
That my
business will never work in your
country.
What do you think, George?
Escobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to
respond in full.
GEORGE
What do I think?
I don't want my answer
to be influenced by what I want, so I'm
going to have to say I don't know.
ESCOBAR
Yes.
I do not know, either.
What do
you want, George?
GEORGE
I want money.
ESCOBAR
Yes.
Money.
Which is what, George?
GEORGE
Freedom.
ESCOBAR
Power?
GEORGE
Yeah, maybe.
ESCOBAR
Family.
GEORGE
Sure.
ESCOBAR
Beautiful girls?
GEORGE
Keep them coming.
ESCOBAR
Keep them coming?
Ah, yes.
Ha ha.
You
are right.
But money.
GEORGE
Money.
ESCOBAR
And Diego?
GEORGE
Diego is my brother.
Escobar looks at George a long time.
He's inscrutable.
ESCOBAR
Good.
Take care of him, George.
I'm
fond of him, but he is sometimes like a
baby.
Keep an eye on him, okay?
Diego is a little pissed off for being left for so long.
He
taps his foot and picks at his fingernails.
Escobar and
George pull up in the Jeep.
Diego leaps to his feet.
DIEGO
Padrino.
Escobar wraps his arms around Diego in an embrace.
ESCOBAR
Diego, mijo.
I've made a decision.
We
are going into business and I would like
to start right away.
MONTAGE - GEORGE AND DIEGO TAKING OVER THE WORLD
The following images are overlaid with snow falling and money
dropping through frame.
CLOSE SHOTS of George and Diego on
the phone, wheeling and dealing, hands counting cash, and
lines being drawn off mirrors.
The effect is surreal and
dreamy.
A stretch limo flies by, left to right.
The windows are open
and Mirtha and George whoop it up as they go by.
George and Mirtha poolside, wearing shades, getting some sun.
She blows him a kiss from the adjoining lounge chair.
He
blows one back.
She licks her lips and it's on.
He's out of
the chair, pouring champagne over her tan body, and licking
it off.
She squeals with delight.
A table gets knocked over as they cause a commotion.
A hotel
manager comes over, but George hands him a wad of cash and he
quickly fucks off.
George and his father walk.
GEORGE
So, business is going good.
I've got
this import/export thing going on in
Miami that's been very profitable.
With
my investments...
FRED
Don't bullshit me, George.
I don't see
you very much, I don't want to waste the
time.
They move along the rear of the house.
Classic cars line the
driveway.
FRED (CONT'D)
You come from my body, remember?
You're
my baby boy.
The same kid who would
jump off a mountain if someone told him
he couldn't do it.
You haven't changed
much.
I know the things you do.
Not
everything.
But I get the picture and I
don't care.
I don't like it.
It's not
what I would have chosen for you, but
it's your life.
It doesn't have
anything to do with me.
He turns and looks at his boy.
FRED (CONT'D)
You're like your mother.
You love
money.
GEORGE
Dad.
FRED
No, it's good.
You have a family.
It's
good if it makes you happy.
It's nice
to have nice things.
Are you happy,
son?
GEORGE
Yeah, Dad.
I'm happy right now.
George and Diego exit the terminal.
George's arm is in a
sling.
The familiar sight of Derek Foreal is Lincoln
Continental.
The three men come together, and Diego and Derek are
introduced.
The men's hands come together and the FRAME
FREEZES on their handshake.
Fred pulls into the driveway in his new car and honks the
horn.
Fred and Ermine get out of the car.
FRED
Hello, hello.
George cruises through the turqoise water of the Caribbean in
a sport fisherman.
Before him is Norman Cay.
White sand
beaches.
Beautiful.
Pristine.
Waiting for him is Cesar.
CESAR
Good to see you, George.
It's been a
long time.
George is getting the shit kicked out of him.
His teeth
broken, kicked in the head, the body, the groin.
His arm
stomped.
Blood and broken bones.
It's a king size beating.
The men prop him up and Cesar reaches back and hits him with
a haymaker.
CRACK.
George's nose is broken.
Blood spurts
everywhere.
George is dropped to the ground, spit on, and
left for dead.
CESAR
Say "hi" to your pretty wife for me.
A beautiful, sprawling estate.
A family barbecue, Colombian
style, is in full swing.
Kids play soccer.
Zoo animals run
wild together.
George is led outside by TWO OVER-ARMED BODYGUARDS.
Pablo
sees him and gives George a big hug.
ESCOBAR
George, you look terrible.
GEORGE
Yeah, well...
ESCOBAR
Diego?
GEORGE
Yeah.
ESCOBAR
Please.
Sit down.
We'll drink some
scotch.
GEORGE
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
ESCOBAR
I see.
I'm sorry about this, George.
I'm not happy about this situation.
It's bad.
You now know who your Brutus
is.
GEORGE
You know why I'm here.
You know what I
have to do.
I came here for permission.
Out of respect, Pablo.
This is
bullshit, he's making me look like a
punk.
ESCOBAR
It is very difficult.
Diego makes me a
lot of money.
If Diego goes so does the
money.
You were an excellent teacher,
George.
When the student has learned
well, the teacher is no longer
necessary.
We must remember we have
wives, friends, familia.
Even familia
that has not been born.
But sometimes,
we must forget as well.
I am like you.
I must teach the lesson.
We want to
teach the lesson.
But we cannot.
We
must remember that life is the teacher.
GEORGE
You're saying life will take care of
Diego?
ESCOBAR
Life will take care of everybody.
Diego, me, you.
It is the teacher.
GEORGE
I get it.
I'm really pissed, Pablo.
You know the DEA knows about Norman's
Cay.
For Chrissakes, Diego worships
Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's
fucked up!
ESCOBAR
I'm sorry, George.
GEORGE
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?
You
and me, Pablo?
Are we good?
ESCOBAR
Of course, George.
We are beautiful.
We are brothers.
Real brothers.
Not
like Diego.
We started this, George.
Escobar embraces George for a moment, and then George starts
to move away.
ESCOBAR (CONT'D)
And, George?
The vengance?
It is best
served cold.
Fred, Ermine and Mirth are waiting for George in the car.
Mirtha's water has broken.
Ermine honks the horn from the
back seat and screams out the window.
ERMINE
George, it's time!
George!
George!
A one-year-old Kristina is being coaxed by George to take her
first steps.
GEORGE
Come on.
Come on, honey.
You can do
it.
Come to Daddy.
Kristina tries, stumbles.
Gets up again.
She looks like a
drunk, but she's doing it.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Good girl!
Mirtha enters.
She's all pinned out, dressed in Ungaro,
Cartier, and dark sunglasses.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Look, Mirtha.
She's walking.
MIRTHA
She did that before.
GEORGE
No.
These are her first steps.
Watch
her.
MIRTHA
Yeah.
I know.
She did that before.
GEORGE
But this is...
MIRTHA
I said, I've seen it before.
GEORGE
Alright.
MIRTHA
Can you lift the furnace.
I need money.
GEORGE
Where are you going?
MIRTHA
Out.
MONTAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS - 1980-85
HOME MOVIE STYLE & PHOTOGRAPHS
The years go by and they are SUPERIMPOSED as they pass.
George, clean and sober, enjoying family life.
Healthy and
happy.
Mr. Mom.
Mirtha looks worse and worse as her habit
becomes bigger and bigger.
As George and Kristina grow
closer and closer, Mirtha is stepping out on the town.
Blowing money right and left.
Shopping with Mirtha, buying
clothes, furs, and diamonds.
As Kristina gets older, WE SEE
her birthday parties.
George and Kristina wearing paper hats
and eating ice cream.
She's two years old, she's three,
four, five, six...
Police cars everywhere.
All the party guests are filed out
the door, and are being led away.
Mirtha is dragged out,
spitting and screaming.
George, in handcuffs, is pushed to a
squad car.
He looks through the window to see a FEMALE
POLICE OFFICER escorting Kristina out of the house.
It's the middle of the night.
George walks through a dark
and lonely house.
He goes to the furnace, opens it up and
sees that there are only five stacks left.
GEORGE
Fuck.
George pulls up to the front.
GEORGE
Hi.
FRED
I heard.
Ermine, your son is here.
ERMINE (O.S.)
Tell him I don't want to see him.
Tell
him he's not welcome here.
GEORGE
Mom.
Ermine's back is to George.
She won't look at him.
ERMINE
Don't you dare step one foot in this
house.
You're not my son, you hear me?
I don't have a son anymore.
She disappears into the house.
The sound of a door slamming.
FRED
She's angry.
It's all over the news.
GEORGE
Yeah.
Listen.
I'm going to be going
away for awhile.
FRED
You're not going to trial?
GEORGE
No.
FRED
Good.
They stand there and look at each other for a while.
There's
a lot to say but nothing's coming out.
George hands Fred a
gym bag.
GEORGE
Give this to Mom, will you?
FRED
Money.
You and your mother.
All the
time chasing it.
I never understood it.
GEORGE
Give it to her, Dad.
It'll make her
happy.
FRED
Yeah, I know.
This is it, isn't it?
The two men throw their arms around each other and hold on to
one another in the doorway of the old house.
GEORGE
Tell Mom, you know...
FRED
I'll tell her.
George breaks away and moves to the T-bird.
FRED (CONT'D)
Take care of yourself.
Mirtha leaps out of the car, teary eyed, crazed and bloodied.
The policemen step from their car.
MIRTHA
He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine
dealer!
There's a kilo in his trunk
right now!
Take this sorry motherfucker
to jail!
George sits behind the wheel.
He knows it's over.
Nine-year old Kristina Jung leaves school.
George, fresh out
of prison, moves across the street to meet her.
KRISTINA
What are you doing here?
GEORGE
Nothing.
I just wanted you to know I
was out.
I just wanted to see you.
KRISTINA
Well, here I am.
See?
GEORGE
How are you doing?
KRISTINA
George, you just can't show up, tell me
you love me, and have everything be
okay.
GEORGE
Dad.
KRISTINA
What?
GEORGE
You can call me Dad if you want.
KRISTINA
I don't want, alright?
It's not funny.
I'm really pissed off, George.
You blew
it, now leave me alone.
GEORGE
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.
I'm going
to make this right.
I've got a few
things going on...
KRISTINA
What do you want from me?
GEORGE
Just to walk with you.
I want to be
your dad again.
KRISTINA
Do what you want, it's a free country.
She walks away.
He follows.
George and Kristina walk through the neighborhood.
He
carries her books.
GEORGE
Let me ask you something.
If you could
go anywhere in the world, anywhere,
where would you want to go?
KRISTINA
You mean, like a trip?
GEORGE
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Kristina thinks about it.
KRISTINA
I don't know.
Maybe California.
George is amused by her answer.
GEORGE
California?
You can go anywhere in the
world.
India.
Tibet.
Australia.
Paris.
And you choose California?
KRISTINA
Yeah.
GEORGE
What is it?
A Disneyland thing?
KRISTINA
No.
I just kind of like the sound of
it.
GEORGE
California, huh?
KRISTINA
California.
They turn a corner and arrive at Kristina's house.
Mirtha is
standing in the doorway.
GEORGE
Go on inside now.
I want to talk to
your mom alone.
He kisses his daughter goodbye.
KRISTINA
Bye, Dad.
See you in the morning, okay?
GEORGE
I'll be here.
George moves over to Mirtha.
It's been a while.
MIRTHA
What do you want?
GEORGE
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
MIRTHA
Yeah.
She told me.
You walk her to
school.
GEORGE
Yeah, so I've been thinking.
I love
her, y'know?
I kind of want to have
her.
I've been away for so long.
Make
up for the missed time, you know?
MIRTHA
I haven't seen one dollar from you.
You
haven't paid me one cent in child
support, alimony.
GEORGE
Yeah, well.
I'm working on that.
I've
got something going.
MIRTHA
Yeah?
I better see some money out of
it.
GEORGE
Yeah, you will.
Of course.
Mirtha looks at her ex-husband.
It's not all bad.
MIRTHA
Hey, look.
You start paying, who knows
what will happen.
You're a good father,
George.
I always gave you that.
But
you've got to talk to her.
GEORGE
Yeah.
MIRTHA
She's getting big.
Getting her own
ideas.
GEORGE
I know.
Well, that's all I really
wanted to say.
So, okay, then.
He moves down the steps and heads for the sidewalk.
MIRTHA
Hey, George.
You okay?
GEORGE
Yeah.
I'm fine.
I'm good.
George, Ben and G.G. wait on the tarmac.
George is pacing.
The sound of a Cessna is heard and soon it is dropping out of
the sky.
The plane lands and taxis over.
Kevin and Leon stick their fists out of the airplane in
triumph.
The men quickly unload the plane into the trunks of
two Broncos and the back of a truck.
George has tears in his eyes.
He is frozen.
Paralyzed by
the memories.
GEORGE
Oh, no.
Nine-year old Kristina Sunshine Jung sits on the front porch
as the sun goes down.
Her bags are packed and ready to go.
GEORGE (V.O.)
I had broken a promise.
Everything I
loved in my life goes away.
A sixty-nine year old Fred shuffles from his house to the
blue LTD.
He gets in, turns the key, and puts his son's tape
into the deck.
GEORGE (V.O.)
You know, I remember a lifetime ago, I
was about three-and-a-half feet tall,
weighing all of sixty-pounds, every inch
your son...
Six-year old George runs through the leaves to the truck and
rides to work with his father.
GEORGE (V.O.)
...those Saturday mornings going to work
with my Dad.
We'd climb into that big
yellow truck.
I used to think it was
the biggest truck in the world.
A vision of Fred Jung sits on the ground before his fifty-two
year old son.
GEORGE
I guess I kind of lost sight of things.
"May the wind always be at your back and
the sun always upon your face, and the
winds of destiny carry you aloft to
dance with the stars."
Love, George.
FRED
That was a beautiful message.
GEORGE
I meant every word of it.
FRED
Did you know I died two weeks after you
sent me that tape?
The apparition of Fred disappears and George is left alone
once again.
GEORGE
Yeah, Dad.
I knew that.
The GUARDS are rounding up the other prisoners and escorting
them inside, but George is still planting sunflowers.
GUARD
Hey, George, five more minutes, buddy.
George turns around as a GUARD taps him on the shoulder.
GUARD
George?
George, come on.
You've got a
visitor.
George looks up to find Kristina being buzzed through the
gate.
She moves through the open area and onto the grass
quickly.
SLOW MOTION: Father and daughter come together at
last in a long embrace.
GEORGE
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry.
KRISTINA
It's alright, Dad.
GEORGE
I didn't mean to...
KRISTINA
I know, Dad.
I know...
He hugs her hard.
GEORGE
I fucked up.
KRISTINA
Shhhh.
GEORGE
I love you.
I love you so much.
You've
got to know that.
You've got to know.
KRISTINA
I know, Dad.
I love you too.
GEORGE
After everything.
After everything, the
only thing left out of my whole life is
you.
Kristina looks at her father, smiles, and disappears.
There
was no Kristina.
The guard continues to tap.
GUARD
George?
George, come on.
It's getting
dark.
George looks up to find a prison guard.
His name is GUS, and
he helps George to his feet.
GEORGE
But I have a visitor.
GUS
Not today, George.
Time to go back.
GEORGE
But I want to put her name on the list
for tomorrow.
My daughter.
GUS
Okay, George.
GEORGE
Because she's visiting me.
GUS
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?
It's
lockdown time.
The shadows grow long, and Gus leads George down a cement
path that cuts through the grass.
The huge structure of
Otisville looms dark against the sky, and Gus and George take
the long walk back.
Standing outside the fences, Kristina smokes a cigarette as
she watches her father being led away.
After a few moments,
she turns around, walks to her car and gets in.
Time to go
home.
And as the brown Mazda pulls out of the driveway, the
taillights turn red, growing smaller and smaller, until they
finally disappear.
THE END.
