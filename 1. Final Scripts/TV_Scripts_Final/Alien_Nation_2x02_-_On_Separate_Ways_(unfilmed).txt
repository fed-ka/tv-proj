                                                                              FADE IN:

      INT. L.A. METRO RAIL CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

      Mrs Ida Hoe, a middle-aged Newcomer, cradles her infant son 
      tightly in her arms as she moves to a seat in the back of 
      the rumbling metro rail car. Though the car is sleek and 
      modern, the unsteadiness of the ride, the graffiti, and the 
      low life's on board suggest a less than ideal mode of 
        transportation. Mrs Hoe finds a seat, settles in, lovingly 
      checks her baby, then reacts to the hiss of the connecting 
      car door opening.

      ANGLE ON - TRIO OF WHITE YOUTHS

      Known as White Peepo. David, Alan and Rick, the all white 
      gang -- dressed in white shirts, thin fifties type ties, 
      black pants with white socks and black loafers -- are an 
      unsettling addition to the car. They move down the aisle, 
      the pulsing electrical system of the metro rail now 
      flickering the lights on and off. Though barely in their 
      teens, the malicious kids are indeed a menace. Alan, "The 
      Wild One", digs through the pockets of a passed out bum, 
      while "Handsome" Rick, moves up next to an attractive young 
      girl and stares her down. David, the arrogant leader, eyes 
      Mrs. Hoe tending her baby.

      DAVID'S POV ON IDA HOE

      Aware that she is being studied, she focuses on her baby, 
      avoiding David's piercing stares.

      THE GANG

      As they move to David and confer. Ida is obviously the 
      subject of conversation. The car appears to be slowing.

      IDA though not her stop she rises and starts moving for the 
      door, hoping to avoid any trouble. She moves by the gang 
      who watch her for a beat, then Davis smashes the circuit 
      panel and the lights go out completely. Random flashes, 
      sparking from the circuit box allow us to witness the 
      violence of an abduction in progress. The boys make a break 
      for it out the end door. When the emergency lights come on, 
      Ida is on the floor of the car, clinging to the empty       blanket that once held her child, pleading to anyone who 
      will listen.

                                  IDA
                    {My baby! My baby! They took my baby!}

      INT. FRANCISCO HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

      George is at the kitchen counter preparing a sack lunch, 
      addressing himself to Vessna who sits in her little porta-
      seat facing him.

                                  GEORGE
                    Okay, you've got your formula, chew stone. 
                    What else are you going to need today?

      A shirtless Buck enters and goes right to the refrigerator 
      in an attempt to forage.

                                  BUCK
                    We never have anything to eat around here.

                                  GEORGE
                    I thought you wanted to go back to old 
                    eating cycles.

                                  BUCK
                    I do. But I'm hungry now.

                                  GEORGE
                    Buck you just ate three days ago.

                                  BUCK
                    Can I help it if I'm a growing boy.

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm going to the market tonight. Write down 
                    whatever you want on the list.

      Buck closes the refrigerator revealing a huge list on the 
      door. George returns his attention to Vessna.

                                  GEORGE
                    All right. Let's see, are we all ready to 
                    go?
                            (remembering)
                    Your froggy. 
                                  (MORE)                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    Buck would you hand me Vessna's pacifier?

      Buck reaches into the refrigerator and pulls out a dead 
      frog. He hands it to George who waves it front of Vessna, 
      giving it to here. The pacifier is well received.

                                  GEORGE
                    There's your froggy. Say "hi froggy." You 
                    know I think she's going to open her eyes 
                    any day now.

                                  BUCK
                    She'll close them the minute she sees a 
                    hairy human.

                                  GEORGE
                    Buck...

                                  BUCK
                    I'm outta here.

                                  GEORGE
                    What about a shirt?

                                  BUCK
                    It's going to be a hundred and five out 
                    there today.

      Buck starts to exit as Susan enters.

                                  SUSAN
                    You've got a dress code at school... let's 
                    not make this a discussion, okay?

      Emily enters wearing huge boxer shorts outside her speedo 
      swimsuit, brightly coloured tennis shoes, and a bolo.

                                  BUCK (RE: EMILY)
                    You going to make that a discussion?

      Emily ignores him and goes to the refrigerator bringing out 
      various items to prepare lunch.                                  SUSAN
                    Emily, put on a dress and get ready for 
                    school.

      She crosses and touches George's temple. Emily ignores her 
      mother's request.

                                  SUSAN
                    Morning.
                          (to Vessna)
                    You all ready to go?

                                  GEORGE
                    I thought I'd take her to MY day-care 
                    today.

                                  SUSAN
                    Why? She's very happy with me.
                            (gathering Vessna)
                    Come on, Neemu.

                                  GEORGE
                    Well, I know, but you've taken her the last 
                    couple of days.

                                  SUSAN (avoiding George)
                    Emily? Didn't I ask you something?

                                  EMILY
                    Mum, please...

                                  GEORGE
                    Why is she wearing underwear like that?

                                  SUSAN
                    Because she's twelve.

                                  EMILY
                    Okay look people, I am beginning high 
                    school today. I think I can dress myself.

                                  SUSAN
                    You're beginning an accelerated program at 
                    high school, I'm still your mother, and I 
                    will not allow you to leave the house 
                    dressed like a Yatzeman...                                  EMILY
                    A what?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yatzeman were those on the ship who cleaned 
                    the carzuloo shoots.

                                  EMILY
                    Gross. Thanks a lot.

                                  GEORGE
                    Em, maybe you'd better change your outfit.

                                  EMILY
                    And I suppose I can't wear any make-up 
                    either.

                                  SUSAN
                    Not unless you want your Carpuzal glands to 
                    clog.

                                  EMILY
                    I'm a little more grown up than you think. 
                    My Carpuzal's will be fine.

      Buck comes in wearing a tank top shirt cut off just below 
      the nipples. Susan vents her frustration at him.

                                  SUSAN (snapping)
                    Buck, for the sake of Celine put on a 
                    shirt!

      He does a U-turn out of the room.

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan, I don't think this is that serious.

                                  SUSAN (still frustrated)
                    Emily, change into an acceptable dress or 
                    stay home from school.

                                  EMILY
                    Fine. You just don't understand. You don't 
                    even want to understand.

      She storms out. The phone rings.                                  GEORGE (crossing to the 
                                  phone)
                    Are you all right?

                                  SUSAN
                    Yes, I'm fine. It's just that ever since 
                    her Tanjello glands turned under she's been 
                      impossible.

      George picks up the phone.

                                  GEORGE
                    Hello. Yes. When? I see. Right. The metro 
                    station at Sixth and Fullerton. I'm on my 
                    way.

      He hangs up, casting a serious look to Susan.

                                  SUSAN
                    What is it?

                                  GEORGE
                    There was another abduction.

      He touches her temple and exits.

      ON SUSAN as THE CAMERA PUSHES in on her, she seems to be 
      lost in a thought that takes her back. It hurts. As she 
      clutches Vessna close, her pained eyes close.

      EXTREME CLOSE UP - ON IDA

      As she tosses her head about, emotionally wrought.

                                  IDA
                    {How many questions do you want me to 
                    answer? I want my baby. They took my baby. 
                    Please somebody help me.}

      The CAMERA WIDENS to see that Ida is seated on the street 
      at the Metro rail entrance, being attended to by a 
      paramedic. Sikes is nearby.

                                  SIKES (to paramedic)
                    Look, can't you give her something to calm 
                    her down?                                  PARAMEDIC
                    We're not certified to do anything to them.

                                  SIKES
                    So what are you doing?

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    We get the call, we come. Then we call the 
                    certified boys. Should be here in another 
                    fifteen.

      ANGLE - On George as he drives up and jumps out of his car. 
      The woman continues her rants as the Paramedic tries to 
      hold her.

                                  SIKES
                    Hey, George.

                                  GEORGE (focused on woman)
                    I'm sorry I'm late. What do you have?

                                  SIKES (indicating Ida)
                    She's the victim. We're kind of having a 
                    little communication breakdown.

      George touches Ida's temple with one hand and places his 
      other hand on her sternum, massaging her chest with 
      clinical strokes. Sikes and the Paramedic look on 
      uncomfortably.

                                  SIKES
                    Haven't got anything from her. Couple of 
                    other people filled me in...
                            (more uncomfortable)
                    Uh... looks like a gang... nobody saw where 
                    they went...
                            (finally, completely 
                              embarrassed)
                    George... you two know each other?

                                  GEORGE (concentrating)
                    She's PRACTIMALNAL/.

                                  SIKES
                    Yeah, well you're out of control.                                  GEORGE
                            (aware of his salacious 
                            audience)
                      Hysterical... like your hyperventilation. 
                    This will calm her


                                  PARAMEDIC (enjoying it)
                    Hell, I gotta get certified.

                                  GEORGE
                    Perhaps if you would, you'd act more like a 
                    paramedic than a goon at a stag party.

                                  SIKES (getting the point)
                    Yeah, well, I guess I'll just see what I 
                    can come up with around here.

      He starts to walk off and notices the paramedic, not 
      getting it, still watching George.

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    You want me to take over for you?

      Sikes grabs the paramedic.

                                  SIKES
                    Why don't you count some bandaids.

      He tosses George an understanding smile and hauls off the 
      paramedic. Ida seems to be calming down.

                                  IDA
                    {Thank you. I'm fine.}

                                  GEORGE
                    {Just relax. Everything will be fine.}

      George finishes up his massage, looking up to make sure the 
      paramedic is watching and seeing.

      Sikes standing nearby talking to a down and out, dirty, 
      stinking transient we will come to know as EDDY LEMOY.

      George kneels next to Ida, who has barely collected 
      herself.                                  GEORGE
                    {Are you okay?}

                                  IDA
                    {They took my baby... on the ship...}

                                  GEORGE
                    {No you're not on the ship...}

                                  IDA
                    {She's gone... my baby is gone.}

                                  GEORGE
                    Just try to tell me what you can.

      All Ida can do is cling to George, her pain from the loss 
      of her baby consuming her.

      INT. OFFICE BUILDING - CORRIDOR - CLOSE ON A NEWSPAPER - 
      DAY

      A headline on the back of the folded paper reads "Newcomer 
      Baby's disappearance third this week." The CAMERA WIDENS to 
      reveal Susan as she moves down the hectic corridor, with 
      Vessna in her porta-seat in one hand, her briefcase 
      dangling and the newspaper in her other hand. She flips the 
      paper and is drawn to the Newcomer article, visibly 
      concerned, as she moves along. Candy Landers, a perky co-
      worker comes bustling by, breaking Susan's concentration.

                                  CANDY
                    Is this a picture of motherhood? The paper, 
                    the baby, the briefcase
                            (having fun)
                    God, you're disgusting.

                                  SUSAN
                    Hi, Candy. What's up?

                                  CANDY
                    Old man Pierce wants a pow-wow on the 
                    Sinatra Spaghetti sauce account. Seems old 
                    blue eyes isn't a happy camper. You're 
                    expected at ten sharp.

      They arrive at a mail/message section of the corridor.                                  SUSAN
                    Me? I don't have anything to do with that 
                    account.

                                  CANDY
                    Hey, come on kid. You're Pierce's number 
                    one player. He wants to throw you in the 
                    ring and mix up the soup.

      Susan puts the porta-seat containing Vessna on a chair, and 
      turns her attention to her mail shot.

                                  SUSAN
                    I thought it was spaghetti sauce?

      Candy pulls a large report out of her briefcase and gives 
      it to Susan who is busy with the mail in her box.

                                  CANDY
                    Here's the background. See you in ten.

      Susan looks at the huge volume and opens it up.

                                  SUSAN
                    Why would anybody want to write so much 
                    about spaghetti?

      She turns smiling to Vessna, but her humour is quickly 
      drained.

      SUSAN'S POV - The chair empty -- Vessna is gone.

      Susan looks around, panic starting to consume her. She 
      rushes up to an office boy.

                                  SUSAN
                    {Did you see my child...?} Vessna... did 
                    you see someone take Vessna?

      The boy shakes his head.

                                  SUSAN
                    Vessna! Help me! My baby's been taken. 
                    Please somebody.

      Office personnel start to come to Susan's assistance as she 
      moves quickly down the corridor.                                  SUSAN
                      Somebody's taken my daughter!

      Susan rounds the corner, practically running into Candy, 
      who turns around to reveal she is holding Vessna.

                                  CANDY
                    Susan, What's the matter?

                                  SUSAN (taking Vessna)
                    I didn't know where Vessna was.

                                  CANDY
                    You're always asking me to put her in day-
                    care.

      The CAMERA PUSHES IN on Susan who is obviously working out 
      something much deeper than she is willing to admit. She 
      holds Vessna closely.

                                  CANDY
                    Susan? Are you alright.

      Susan snaps out of her thought. Embarrassed at the gathered 
      crowd.

                                  SUSAN
                    Yes. I'm sorry. I'm... sorry.

      She moves down the hall, embarrassed, clinging to Vessna.

      INT. POLICE STATION - SQUAD ROOM - DAY

      Grazer moves through the mess of office humanity to Sikes 
      and George's desk, where the two detectives are huddled 
      with Zepeda.

                    Bryon, it's all over the shop. You invested 
                    your savings in that dump, you're losing 
                    your shirt, your wife's about to sign you

                    All the other abductions were done with a 
                    great deal of caution. The mother's 
                      momentarily turned from their children and

                                  GRAZER
                    So, this abduction is probably unrelated to 
                    the others.

      locker next to Emily's. She's dressed exactly the way Emily 
      was before her mother made her change her clothes. Her name 
      is Mindy Hooks. She notices Emily.

      mirror on the inside of her locker.

      Mindy catches a handsome stud walk by and is drawn to him.

      BACK showing her alone in the empty hallway.

      INT. PARIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Several young French couples sit around a coffee table, 
      littered with wine, cheese and fruit. The chic crowd has 
      obviously been enjoying the food and wine for the better 
      part of the evening. As CLAUDETTE, a young hostess, pours 
      espresso for her guests, GUY the young host addresses the 
      crowd. Nearby, a middle-aged man, known as SALAMANDRA 
      stands out among the younger crowd. He is dressed just as 
      chicly as the others. All speak their native French tongue.

                    All right. All right.

      He rises and crosses down the hallway, as the others mill 
      with excitement.

      INT. PARIS APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      As guy walks in, and flicks on the light.

                                  GUY
                    All right, little fella. It's showtime. Up 
                    and at 'em.

      ANGLE ON THE CRIB to see the near motionless body of a 
      Newcomer infant.

      Guy moves to the crib and bends down, picking up the child. 
      As he starts to collect it, he grimaces, reacting to a 
      peculiar smell. He checks the lethargic baby and notices a 
      thin layer of clear ooze on the baby's hand. He touches it, 
      rubs it between his fingers and sniffs it, reacting to the 
      pungent smell. He grabs a nearby diaper and quickly dabs 
      the baby clean, tossing the diaper back in the crib.

                                  GUY
                    You are quite a creature.

      As he exits, THE CAMERA PANS to the discarded diaper in the 
      crib. The clear ooze on the diaper, starts to fizz 
      slightly. As THE CAMERA PUSHES IN we see the bubbling ooze 
      begin to smoke.


                                  END OF ACT ONE.                                        ACT TWO

                                                                              FADE IN:

      INT. FRANCISCO HOUSE - DINNING ROOM - NIGHT

      The family is at the table which is filled with enough food 
      for twelve people. Everyone is voraciously eating. George 
      takes a break and looks up.

                                  GEORGE
                    Well, do you all prefer eating this way?

                                  BUCK
                    Fine with me.

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan?

                                  SUSAN
                    We've tried so hard to adapt to the human 
                    eating cycles, but one meal every three or 
                    four days is so much better for us.

                                  GEORGE
                    Em? What about you?

                                  EMILY
                    What about me? You'll just do whatever YOU 
                    want.

                                  SUSAN
                    Emily, your father was simply asking your 
                    opinion.

                                  EMILY
                    So when does my opinion suddenly matter?

                                  BUCK
                    Unplug it, Em.

                                  EMILY
                    Pass the pinecones.

                                  SUSAN
                    {Please.}                                  EMILY
                    {Please.}

                                  GEORGE
                    So, how was your first day of high school?

                                  EMILY
                    I felt stupid in that dress I wore. I spoke 
                    to one person and everybody else looked at 
                    me like I was a freak.

                                  BUCK
                    Welcome to Reagan High.

                                  EMILY
                    I don't know what's worse. School or here.

                                  GEORGE
                    What's that supposed to mean?

                                  SUSAN
                    It means she's twelve and for some reason 
                    on this planet when you reach that age it 
                    means you can sulk and be rude.

      Emily throws down her fork, rolling her eyes.

                                  EMILY
                    When you were twelve you didn't have your 
                    parents telling you what to do, when to 
                    eat, what to wear.

                                  GEORGE
                    No, we had Overseers to do that after they 
                    ripped us away from our parents.

                                  EMILY
                    Maybe they can rip me away from you.

      Susan straightens and shoots Emily a stern look.

                                  SUSAN
                    You may be excused from this table.

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan, I don't think she meant that.                                  SUSAN
                    What did you mean, Emily.

                                  EMILY
                    You just don't understand.

                                  SUSAN (aggravated)
                    Can you help me understand why you would 
                    like some overpowering slave controller 
                    coming in here and tearing you from my 
                    arms... help me understand that...

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan...

                                  SUSAN
                    No, George. SHE doesn't understand and I 
                    will not have her at this table.

                                  EMILY
                    Fine. I'll leave.

                                  GEORGE
                    Emily! Perhaps an apology...

      Emily exits. There is a long beat, then, breaking the 
      tension in the room we hear,

                                  BUCK
                    Maybe the pinecones were bad.

      Susan shoots Buck a hard look. He raises his hands as if to 
      surrender.

                                  GEORGE
                    Buck, I don't think your humour is 
                      appreciated at the moment.

      Susan rises and starts out the room.

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan?

      She exits. George looks at Buck who takes a beat, then 
      offers a bowl to George.

                                  BUCK
                    Pinecone?      INT. FRANCISCO HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      The door opens on the dark room, revealing Susan, balled-up 
      in the corner, her arms tight around her knees, pulled 
      close to her chest.

      George moves into FRAME, kneeling next to her.

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan what is it?

                                  SUSAN
                    I'm sorry.

                                  GEORGE
                    No. There's something more. {Talk to me.}

                                  SUSAN
                    It's nothing. It's everything.

      George embraces her.

                                  GEORGE
                    Our children are growing up. It's very hard 
                    at times to let them do that.

                                  SUSAN
                    I want them to grow up. That's not it.

                                  GEORGE
                    The kidnappings?

      A chord is struck. Susan tightens and looks at George.

                                  SUSAN
                    Remember all the others... all the 
                    babies...

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan, no, this isn't {Landing Three.}

                                  SUSAN
                    Do you remember them? The faces of the 
                    mothers and fathers? What was the face of 
                    the woman who lost her child today like, 
                    George?                                  GEORGE
                    Listen to me. This isn't {Landing Three.}

                                  SUSAN
                    How did her face look, George?

      FLASHBACK TO

      EXT. LANDING THREE MINING CAMP - DAY

      The red dirt swirls as George stands before a flapping tent 
      in his slave clothing. Newcomers push by him in panic. 
      George is trying to wrestle a baby from a Newcomer female 
      who pleads, tears flowing. George is desperately trying to 
      communicate t the woman.

                                  GEORGE (V.O.)
                    It's not the same.

      BACK TO SCENE - ON SUSAN AND GEORGE

      Susan looks at George intensely.

                                  SUSAN
                    Then why is everything in me screaming to 
                    keep my family close?

      Seeing the pain in Susan's eyes, George pulls her close.

      INT. POLICE STATION - SQUAD ROOM - DAY

      Sikes is at his desk with Zepeda who stands over his 
      shoulder looking at a dozen black and white photos of men 
      and boys in white shirts and black ties.

                    right lobe. The Dairies don't wear 
                      underwear.

      George enters with a communiqu  in hand and crosses to 
      Grazer's office, through,

                                  GEORGE
                    Something else has come up.

      Sikes is up and following.

                    Europe...

      They enter,

      INT. POLICE STATION - GRAZER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      As George moves to Grazer's desk. Sikes stands in the 
      doorway.

                                  GEORGE
                    I asked for it to be routed into here.

                    anything more.

      The phone rings. George pushes the speaker box.

                                  GEORGE (in French)
                    Hello, officer Jarre. This is officer

      Sikes picks up a tacky menu from the Fromage Cantina off of

                    adults were found with the baby... all of 
                    them are seriously ill. I think we're going 
                    to need a little help from you here.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY

      Emily has her back to us as Buck speaks to her.

                                  BUCK
                    Well, how much did you use?

                                  EMILY
                    Barely any. A little lipstick and some 
                    mascara.

      THE CAMERA MOVES around to see Emily. Her eyes are starting 
      to swell closed and her lips are puffy.

                                  BUCK
                    You definitely clogged up something.

                                  EMILY
                    What am I going to do?

                                  BUCK
                    Get a note from the nurse and go home.

                                  EMILY
                    Sure and have mum kill me.

                                  BUCK
                    Better than staying around this place and 
                    have friendly terts give you the once over.

      They look at passing kids who stare and snicker as they       walk by.

                                  BUCK
                    Look, I gotta get out of here.

                                  EMILY
                    What do you mean? Don't you have classes?

                                  BUCK (uncomfortable)
                    Yeah, right. I'll see you later.

                    I've been so distracted. I requested Cathy 
                    to assist in bringing back the Newcomer 
                    baby. Since we needed a researcher I 
                    thought I'd make it kind of a family thing.

                    Yes, I'm sure it must be better equipped 
                    than what we have here.

                                  GEORGE
                    Is there something wrong?

                                  JARRE
                    No. My wife, wanted so much to meet you... 
                    she's never seen a Newcomer. We were having 
                    some friends in tonight...

                                  CATHY
                    That's very kind. Perhaps when we return.

                                  JARRE
                    Thank you. She would be pleased.

      INT. FRENCH HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

      Sikes and George move through the lobby with their bags.                                  GEORGE
                    Do I have time to call home?

                                  SIKES
                    Yeah, but you'll be walking in the door in 
                    twelve hours.

                    Susan's been having a hard time with 
                    Emily... I just want to check in.

                                  SIKES
                    I'll get one of those little cups of 
                    coffee.

      George crosses to a phone as Sikes crosses to a love seat 
      in the lobby. He tries to signal a waitress. She moves to 
      him, then past him to another French couple. Sikes pulls 
      out his dictionary as the waitress crosses back.

      The waitress stops.

                    Would I like a cup of coffee? I'm sure you 
                    mean you would like one. Black? Milk?

      The waitress frowns, Sikes smiles and looks past her to, 
      Cathy who is walking through the lobby with her bag. 
      Everyone in the place has stopped to stare at her. She's 
      uncomfortable but smiles when she sees Sikes. She sits with 
      him.                                  SIKES

                    home, Matt. We both stand out like a sore 
                    plumb.

      The waitress comes up.

                    to make some notes.

      As the CAMERA PANS from two Frenchmen talking, their hands 
      flying, their body language very French. The CAMERA PANS 
      over to a young romantic couple. They are in love, and talk 
      close, kissing between the words.

      BACK ON SIKES AND CATHY

      Having seen the lovers, their eyes avoid meeting. The

      You'll have to tell Buck I couldn't find any Swedish

                                  SUSAN
                    He's probably forgotten about them anyway. 
                    I'm glad you're coming home.

                                  GEORGE
                    How's Emily doing?

                                  SUSAN
                    She's working out her problem. Buck has 
                    suggested I "give her some space".

                                  GEORGE
                    And how are you doing?

      There is a long pause.                                  GEORGE
                    Susan?

                                  SUSAN
                    I've been reliving Landing Three, over and 
                    over again.

                                  GEORGE
                    No you mustn't.

                                  SUSAN
                    We could have saved so many, George.

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan, we'll find the man who's taking the 
                    babies...

                                  SUSAN
                    But they're sick. Like Landing Three... 
                    what if it starts again.

                                  GEORGE
                    It won't. This is not Landing Three. Do you 
                      understand.

      Susan is lost in thought.

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan, do you understand.

                                  SUSAN
                    Hurry home, George.

                                  GEORGE
                    I will. {I love you}

                                  SUSAN
                    {As do I love you}

      END INTERCUT as Susan hangs up. She reaches over and picks 
      up Vessna out of her crib. The CAMERA PUSHES IN on her as 
      she comforts her baby, thinking about the past. George's 
        conversation has not resolved her dark memories. As THE 
      CAMERA PUSHES IN we hear the sound of a wind storm building 
      and voices shouting above the noise.                                  SUSAN (V.O.)

      EXT./INT. LANDING THREE - TENT - DAY

      As Susan moves from a large metal container to the flapping 
      opening of the tent, joining George with the Newcomer woman 
      who clings to her baby.

                    her. Prepare the container for loading... 
                    I'll try.}

      George spots something.

      ANGLE - ON APPROACHING OVERSEERS

      As they move through a limbo cloud of red blowing dust, 
      some kind of breathing device over their mouths.

      BACK TO SCENE

      As George grabs Susan.

                                  GEORGE
                    {We have to leave her.}

                    others.}

                                  SUSAN

      At this late hour, only a skeletal crew works the place.

      Sikes smiles and moves off.

      George turns on his computer, takes out his notepad and 
      starts to fill out his report. Behind him we see, Eddy 
      Lemoy the scrappy transient we saw in the opening with 
      Sikes, as he moves into the room. George doesn't see him at 
      first but Eddy moves decisively to Sikes desk, throws his 
      heavy coat on top of the desk, then starts rummaging 
      through the top drawers. George can only look at him in 
      disbelief.

                    There's a machine in the hallway.

      Eddy comes up with a candy bar. George is up and crossing 
      to the transient.

                                  GEORGE
                    I want you to put the candy bar down and 
                    walk out of here.

      Eddy doesn't react.                                  GEORGE
                    I'm very, very serious.

      Eddy starts to put the candy bar down, then quickly pops it 
      in his mouth. George jumps him. As Sikes approaches.

                    Yes, thank you very much. I'm sorry about 
                    the candy bar.

                    Sorry about my bad habits. I'll introduce

      Eddy walks out as Cathy approaches.

                    Matt, you'd better take me back to the

                                  GEORGE
                    What is it?

                    The ooze we took off the baby is definitely 
                    linked to a poisoning of human blood.

                    It's what attacked the French.

                    And right now we don't know how to control 
                    it... let alone reverse it.

      The CAMERA PUSHES IN on George. These words have effected 
      him directly.

      FLASHBACK TO

      EXT. LANDING THREE - DAY

      As the overseers, their faces protected with futuristic, 
      minimal gas masks, walk through the blowing dust, now       holding the Newcomer woman who clings to her baby.

                                  OVERSEER ONE
                    {We're running out of time. This storm is

                    cost us an unfortunate delay.}

      They move on and the CAMERA PANS to the flapping tent door 
      where we see the suggestion of Susan and George.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Mum. Mum are you all right.

      END FLASHBACK

      INT. FRANCISCO HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Susan is curled up on the floor near Vessna's crib. Emily 
      is over her trying to wake her up. Susan suddenly awakens 
      with a start and moves right to the crib.

                                  SUSAN
                    {What?} Is she all right?

                                  EMILY
                    She's fine. Mum, what are you doing?

                                  SUSAN
                    I must have fallen asleep. Is your father 
                    home yet?                                  EMILY
                    No. It sounded like you were crying in 
                    here.

      Susan grabs Emily and squeezes her tightly.

                                  EMILY
                    Mum, I'm sorry. I don't want to fight 
                    anymore. I don't want to make you sad.

                                  SUSAN
                    Oh, Emily I love you so much. I haven't 
                    been easy to live with, I know.
                            (off Emily's look)
                    It's something that happened a long time 
                    ago... something that I thought could never 
                    happen again.

                                  EMILY
                    Is it? Happening again?

      The two sit near the crib.

                                  SUSAN
                    I don't know.
                            (she takes a deep breath)
                    Your father and I were part of a loading 
                    team... when the overseers recovered slaves 
                    from a mining camp they would send workers 
                    like us down to pack up machinery, food and 
                    water processors, whatever they could reuse 
                    at the next drop point.
                            (she swallows hard, the 
                            memories coming strong.)
                    Landing Three was a colony of Sandiska 
                      Diggers... mine workers, about a thousand 
                    families. The minerals were all mined out 
                    and we were moving them when a medical team 
                    found one of the infants was infected with 
                    some kind of virus... from the dust or air. 
                    They took several of the infants on board 
                    ship for examination and determined they 
                    were too contaminated... your father and I 
                    were the only ones who knew the fate of 
                    Landing Three.      FLASHBACK TO

      EXT. LANDING THREE - DAY

      As the overseers we saw before continue past the tent where 
      George and Susan are loading equipment.

                                  OVERSEER ONE
                            (shouting above the building 
                            storm)
                    {Leave them all. Load the equipment and our 
                    workers and move out.}

                                  OVERSEER TWO
                    {On your command.}

      They move past George and Susan who have heard the doomsday 
      command.

                                  SUSAN (V.O.)
                    We had to save the babies... we had to.

      DISSOLVE TO

      INT. LANDING THREE - TENT - DAY

      As George moves in, revealing several bundled babies under 
      his slave smock. He hands them to Susan who carefully 
      places them in a well-vented steel container.

                                  SUSAN (V.O.)
                    There were so many, and time was running 
                    out.

      The Newcomer woman, with baby in arms, looks in the tent, 
      spotting George and Susan, closing the container on the 
      babies. She looks at them in horror.

                                  NEWCOMER WOMAN
                    {What are you doing? You're killing the 
                    babies.}

      George jumps up and goes for the woman. The struggle leads 
      us outside as we saw before. Susan is at the tent door and 
      spots,                                  SUSAN (V.O.)
                    She didn't understand why we were hiding 
                    the babies in the equipment locker.

      THE OVERSEERS approaching.

      George struggles but it is too late. The Overseers arrive, 
      listen to the woman, throw Susan aside and go into the 
      tent, opening the locker to reveal the babies, and a rage 
      that cowers Susan.

      END FLASHBACK

      INT. FRANCISCO HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      A tear is rolling down Susan's cheek as Emily embraces her.

                                  SUSAN
                    She didn't understand we were only trying 
                    to save the babies.

                                  EMILY
                    Mum, it wasn't your fault.

                                  SUSAN
                    But I still live with the memories. The 
                    pain of the mothers who lost their 
                      children... and the look from the woman as 
                    we tried to take her child... a look that I 
                    prayed we'd never share as a people again.

                                  EMILY
                    Why didn't you tell me this before?

                                  SUSAN
                    I don't know. I guess I was... afraid.

                                  EMILY
                    That I wouldn't understand what you went 
                    through?

                                  SUSAN
                    No... that you would understand.

      She embraces Emily.                                  SUSAN
                    What we survived should never be your pain.

                                  EMILY
                    Mum, I'm glad you told me. I don't want you 
                    to be so... alone again.

                                  SUSAN
                    I don't either.

                                  EMILY
                    And... thanks for being my mum.

      INT. FRANCISCO HOUSE - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

      George enters, suitcase in hand. The room is dark.

                                  GEORGE
                    Hello?

      Hearing no response, he shuts off the hall light and heads 
      upstairs.

      INT. FRANCISCO HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      George comes to the bedroom door where he stops and smiles.

      SUSAN AND EMILY - GEORGE'S POV

      Curled up together on the floor by Vessna's crib. They are 
      at peace, and sound asleep.

      EXT. WESTSIDE ALLEY - ON A GRAFFITI COVERED WALL - DAY

      Strong symbols make up this fashionable graffiti. A roller 
      of white wash covers it.

      WIDEN TO INCLUDE

      George, in city-issued coveralls, stirring paint, is 
      watching Sikes, dressed in similar fashion, paint out the 
      graffiti with a roller on a long pole.

                                  GEORGE
                    You really think by painting out this 
                    gangs' slogans they are going to show up?                                  SIKES
                    These slogans mean more to them than their 
                    mothers. It's their mark, their life... you 
                    wipe it out, you wipe them out.

                                  GEORGE
                    And they'll return to resurrect themselves.

                                  SIKES
                    They'll return with spray cans to piss on 
                    the wall again.

                                  DAVID (V.O.)
                    You got a reason to be doing that?

      George and Sikes turn to see, David, Alan and Rick, whom we 
      recognise from the opening act as the abductors of the 
      Newcomer baby. Donned in their white shirts, black ties and 
      pants, they are White Peepo.

                                  SIKES
                    You got a reason to care?

                                  RICK
                    You're messin' with our tags.

                                  GEORGE
                    You're White Peepo?

      David pulls a knife and puffs up.

                                  DAVID
                    Go do your cleaning somewhere else.

      George and Sikes exchange a look. George puts his stirring 
      stick down reaching for his gun strapped to his ankle as 
      Sikes placates the gang.

                                  SIKES
                    I haven't got a problem with that. You got 
                    a problem with that, George?

                                  GEORGE (ready for action)
                    Well, yes, actually I do.

      The two start walking off, when suddenly Sikes turns with 
      the soggy roller on the pole, smacking David hard on the 
      head. Simultaneously, George turns, his gun aimed at the       other boys as David goes down to the ground, his knife 
      flying out of his hand.

                                  GEORGE
                    We're police officers... you're under 
                    arrest.

      The other boys immediately put up their hands, scared out 
      of their minds. Sikes moves in on David, cuffing the paint-
      soaked minor.

                                  SIKES (RE: DAVID)
                    Looks like White Peepo just got a little 
                    whiter.

      INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      The three minors sit at a desk in the barren interrogation 
      room. George sits across from them.

                                  DAVID (to George)
                    Give me a cigarette.

                                  GEORGE
                    I don't smoke.

                                  DAVID
                    I'm going to have your partner's ass for 
                    hittin' me like that.

                                  GEORGE
                    And what will you do with his ass?

      David wipes some paint dripping into his mouth, then spits 
      on the floor. Sikes enters.

                                  SIKES
                    Okay, kids, a lawyer's on the way. You know 
                    your rights. the '94 juvenile code is in 
                    effect, so given the crime, you'll be 
                    treated as adults which means a minimum of 
                    fifteen to life for kidnapping. Anybody 
                    want to co-operate and start talking?

      They sit smugly, Rick maybe a little more nervous than the 
      others.                                  SIKES
                    Oh, and by the way, that mirror over there 
                    is a two way, as you probably guessed, and 
                    four witnesses have positively I.D.ed you. 
                    A little co-operation at this point 
                    wouldn't hurt.

      Nothing.

                                  GEORGE
                    Do you know what I'd do to you if you took 
                    my baby?

                                  DAVID
                    We don't really care, spotty.

                    David Musterband... you've been nailed as

                    That makes toy two accessories... maybe get 
                    off with a little probation while Davey 
                    here's passed around the San Quentin bridge 
                    club.

                    You're breathing on the wrong face, dick.

                                  GEORGE (ignoring David to 
                                  the others)
                    We don't want you. We want the person who's 
                    trading the babies.

                    I said you're breathing on the wrong face, 
                    dick.

      George's contained rage finally blows. He grabs David and 
      pulls him to his feet.

                                  GEORGE
                    And so are you.

      George drags him to the door and summons a uniformed 
      officer.                                  GEORGE
                    Take him to a holding cell.

      David raises a fist saluting his brothers.

                    White Peepo.

      The brothers raise their fist, being cool. George closes 
      the door and turns to Rick and Alan.

                                  GEORGE
                    Now, who's face wants to be breathed on 
                    next?

      The two gang members exchange a rather uncomfortable look, 
      bracing themselves for the next round of talks.

                    The ooze from the baby is directly related 
                    to the Predeal effect.

                                  GEORGE
                    Predeal? But it's far more potent than

                    Yes, well apparently the carbon monoxide in 
                    the Earth's atmosphere complicates the 
                    Predeal causing the secretions to be far

                    suffer the same consequences as the French.

                    Based on the length of time they've been 
                    missing that could be within days.

      The television flickers with a news report.

                                  ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                    If you know anyone who has seen one of 
                    these babies or who has one, please report 
                    them immediately to the Alien Institute or 
                    your local police station. We are listing 
                    numbers now.

      Numbers appear below the announcer as the CAMERA PULLS back 
      to see a baby crib. There is some movement under a blanket. 
      The head of a little Newcomer baby sticks up.                                  ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                    Again, this is a medical alert. The 
                    Newcomer babies are extremely toxic and 
                    cause severe complications if they are not 
                    treated properly. If you see one do not 
                    touch it, report it to the proper 
                      authorities.

      WIDEN to see that we are in the well-appointed apartment of 
      Miss Doris Green, who, as the CAMERA PULLS BACK is REVEALED 
      sitting on a sofa in front of the television, her back to 
      us. She seems to awaken with a start, then writhes in pain. 
      She finally turns to CAMERA. Her face contorting in pain. 
      She rises knocking over the television which explodes in a 
      flash of sparks. Blinded by the ooze and toxin crippling 
      her, she throws open her apartment door, and falls on the 
      opposite wall, pulling a fire alarm as she does. As the 
      siren sounds, the CAMERA PUSHES IN on the dying woman, and

                    According to the doorman, our victim was a

                    to legally adopt a kid and apparently in 
                    need of some better companionship than a

                    The Predeal was that strong?

                    Even more so than the French... probably

                    any longer and help me co-ordinate these

      Sikes moves around and looks at the computer, though his

      Sikes and George turn to see Susan standing over them with 
      the baby in her arms. Courageously, Susan gives Vessna to 
      George. They touch temples. Susan smiles and exits.

      EXT. CITY STREET - ON RICK - DAY

      Through a LONG LENS we watch as Rick walks down the street, 
      cradling a box which holds Vessna, in his gang uniform -- 
      black tie and white shirt -- and moves to a row of pay 
      phones. PULLBACK TO REVEAL,

      George and Sikes as they sit in their car on the opposite 
      side of the street watching Rick.

                                  GEORGE
                    I don't think we should be so exposed.

                    Vessna is quite comfortable. The buildings 
                    are covered. There's a man at every corner.

                    Fine. So why are we doing this?

      George is distracted by the action on the street where we 
      see, Rick reacting and moving to the phone. He nods, and 
      listens.

      ANGLE ON RICK as he carries the box and tips it to a 
      partially lowered rear window of the Cadillac.

      ANGLE ON THE BOX to REVEAL little Vessna comfortably lying 
      inside.

      BACK TO SCENE OVER SIKES AND GEORGE to see in the distance 
      the window of the Cadillac go up, the back door pops open, 
      and Rick climbs in with Vessna.

      THE BLACK CADILLAC drives off, Sikes and George doing a 
      leisurely U-turn and following.

      ANOTHER ANGLE - ON THE CADILLAC as it turns down a side 
      street and parks.

      SIKES AND GEORGE are at a traffic light looking down the 
      block at the car.

                    It'd be the first thing Salamandra would 
                    pick up.

      ON THE BLACK CADILLAC as the back door opens and Rick gets 
      out holding the box. He carefully tucks Vessna's arm 
      inside.

      A WHITE CADILLAC rounds the corners and pulls up between 
      Rick and the black Cadillac. the back door pops open. Rick 
      gets in.      ON THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL as it turns green. George isn't 
      moving through the signal and the driver behind him is 
      getting anxious. The driver leans on his horn.

                    We gotta do something.

      George starts through intersection slowly. Both men stare 
      at the white Cadillac, waiting for "The" signal.

      ON THE WHITE CADILLAC - GEORGE AND SIKES POV

      As the back window goes down and we see Rick spit. George 
      and Sikes react to the spit.

                    That's it.

      Sikes grabs the walkie-talkie, while George does a high 
      speed U-turn in the intersection barrelling down on the 
      Cadillac.

      TWO BLACK AND WHITES round the corner.

      TWO MORE BLACK AND WHITES join Sikes and George in the 
      charge.

      THE WHITE CADILLAC jerks to a halt, the front door opens, 
      and Salamandra, a little man in a baggy over coat, jumps 
      out, slicing on foot through heavy traffic, causing two 
      cars to collide, and sending,

      GEORGE AND SIKES' CAR leaping the curb into a newspaper 
      rack.

      Sikes leaps out but is stopped momentarily by George as he 
      gets out of the car, touching his ear plug.

                    He has the baby.

      They look up to see Salamandra get into a cab and drive 
      off.

                    Get me to the airport... and there's a 
                    hundred in it if it's non stop.

      The CAMERA MOVES off Salamandra to the, CAB DRIVER Who 
      smiles, and we recognise Eddy Lemoy, the one and only 
      undercover cop, forgetting to introduce himself at the 
      moment.

                    I don't see a problem with that.

      As Eddy smiles and breaks at a stop light, Sal gently 
      places the baby on the seat next to him.

                                  SALAMANDRA
                    I mean NO stops.

      VARIOUS ANGLES

      As Eddy turns, pedestrians, really cops, move to the car -- 
      everyone has a gun drawn.

                    You even blink and you're all over the 
                    window.

      The door is ripped open and George collects Vessna, as 
      Sikes simultaneously pins Salamandra back in the car, 
      ripping his jacket open in a quick search for weapons.
