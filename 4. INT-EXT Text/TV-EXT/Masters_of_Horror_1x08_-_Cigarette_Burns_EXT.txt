  -- an early-90 s Sentra pulls up and stops at a large 
  security gate. The driver rolls the window down. 

  KIRBY SWEETMAN. Late-20 s, scruffy, with tired eyes and the 
  ghost of a smile.  

                                          KIRBY 
                          Hi. You called me? From The 
                            Vogue? 

  The gate swings open wide in response. 



  Huge, beautiful, secluded, the property completely 
    surrounded by trees and high walls. Kirby climbs out of his 
  car. 

  FUNG steps out of the front door to greet Kirby, a thin, 
    impeccably dressed Chinese man in his late-50's. 

                                          FUNG 
                            You're late. Mr. Bellinger 
                          is waiting. 


  Kirby walks out, dazed. Fung closes the front door as Kirby 
  stops by his car. He looks back up at the house.  

                                          KIRBY  
                            What the fuck did I just 

  Downtown Los Angeles. The worst part of town. Skid Row would 
  be a step up. In the middle of the block, a huge once-
  beautiful movie palace stands, lit up, faded and run-down.  

  On the marquee: PROFONDO ROSSO and CAT O' NINE TAILS. 
  Kirby's car heads down the alley beside the theater.  



  Timpson puts up FUNNY GAMES and IRREVERSIBLE on the marquee. 

  Parked across the street, someone we don't get a good look 
  at sits his car, hat down over his face. When he sees 
  Timpson finish, he sits up, suddenly alert. He reaches over 
  and opens his glove compartment. 

  Inside, there's a gun. 



  Kirby climbs out of a rental car in front of a rustic house 
  on an isolated lot. Tall trees surround the entire property. 

    SUPERIMPOSE: UPSTATE NEW YORK CITY 

  Kirby heads up the front steps and knocks on the door. He 
  waits for a long moment. He looks at the yard, the house, 
  both in an advanced sense of disrepair. 

  He knocks again. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          Mr. Meyers...? 
                            (beat) 
                          Mr. Meyers? Sir? 

  Kirby knocks again. A slight shuffling sound in response. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          Mr. Meyers, I'd like to 
                            talk to you. It's 
                            important. Please. 

  The door opens. 

  From the other side of the door, inches away, as if 
  someone's crouched there, comes a diseased, leathery 
  whisper. 

                                          MEYERS (O.S.) 
                          Go away. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Sir, I just need a moment 
                          or two... 
 
                                          MEYERS (O.S.) 
                          Who sent you? 
 
                                           KIRBY 
                          No one sent me. I came 
                            because of something you 
                            wrote. A review. 
 
                                          MEYERS (O.S.) 
                          I'm done with all of that. 
                            I won't discuss any... 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            It's about LA FIN ABSOLUE 
                          DU MONDE. 

  Silence. 

  Then Kirby reaches out and opens the door with a push. 



  A nice hotel, but nothing extravagant. 

    SUPERIMPOSE: PARIS, FRANCE



  Kirby's in a cab, drives slowly past a few garment factory 
  shops, then stops in front of a very old warehouse building. 
  Kirby climbs out, looks up and down the street, sees no one.   He knocks hard on the oversized metal door. 

  Two guys walk out the front door, thick-necked, ruddy men in 
  their 40's, KASPAR and HORST. 

  Kirby looks back over at the cab. The CAB DRIVER, a tired- 
  looking French woman in her 30's, has her window down.  

                                          KIRBY 
                          (in French; subtitled) 
                          Je serai de retour dans 20 
                            minutes. (I'll be out in 
                            twenty minutes.) 


  Downtown Vancouver. Tall apartment buildings. 


    SUPERIMPOSE: VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA 



  Kirby steps up to the front of one particular building and 
  checks the security panel. He finds one name in particular: 
    "PENTHOUSE -- BAKOVIC" 

  Kirby hits the button next to the name and waits for a long 
  moment. He's about to buzz again when the speaker crackles 
  to life. 

                                          KATJA (ON 
                                          INTERCOM) 
                            Yes? 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Mrs. Backovic? 

  No response. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Mrs. Backovic, I've come a 
                            long way to see you. 
                            Please. 

  After another long pause, there's a buzz and a clicking, and 

  Kirby's car pulls up to Bellinger's gate. The gate swings 
  open and Kirby heads up toward the house. 

  Bellinger walks out his front door as Kirby walks around to 
  his trunk to open it. He stands back so Bellinger can see 
  the two film cans. 

  Bellinger's so excited he's almost dancing, dressed like 
  he's going out for an evening of theater.  

  He hands Kirby a check for $200,000. 

                                          BELLINGER 
                            Worth every penny.   Bellinger reaches into the trunk and lays his hand on the 
  film cans, as if he doesn't believe they're real. He looks 
  over at Kirby and smiles.  

                                          BELLINGER 
                            I can feel it. 

  He lifts the film cans out of the trunk.


  INTERCUT - KIRBY'S CAR / BELLINGER'S SCREENING ROOM   NIGHT 

  Kirby heads back out onto Mulholland. As Kirby drives, we 
  keep him in extreme CLOSE-UP. We only get the impression of 
  passing headlights and street lights.  

  Bellinger sets the cans down next to his projector and opens 
  them. He runs his hands over the actual print and shivers. 

  He threads up the print, handling it gently, like he's 
  caressing a lover. 

  Kirby gets out onto the freeway and floors it, the wind 
  blowing through his hair, eager to put it all behind him. 
  Still, we stay tight on him, and we can see the toll this 
  has taken on him. He's shaky, worn out. 

  Bellinger starts the projector, heads down into his 
  screening room. Fung stays to make sure everything runs 
  okay. 

  Kirby retrieves a bottle of whiskey from the back seat, 
  cracks the seal, and takes a big pull off of it, all without 
  taking his eyes off the road. 

  As the lights in the screening room dim, Bellinger settles 
  into his seat and pops the cork on champagne, grinning like 
  it's Christmas morning.



  The entire theater is dark. Kirby parks in front and climbs 
  out, mystified. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            What the fuck? 

  He checks his watch as he walks up to the front doors. Heavy 
  chains have been strung across the doors. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          NO!   Furious, Kirby throws his bottle at the front doors, 
  shatters it. Kirby pulls out his phone, stabs in a number. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Timpson... yeah, I just got 
                            back. I'm standing in front 
                          of the theater right now. 
                            Where the hell are you?! 
                            (pause) 
                          You were there! He said I 
                          had a fucking week! When 
                          did he come back and put 
                          the chains on? 

  The answer just makes Kirby angrier and he kicks the front 
  gate, hard. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            (pause) 
                            Goddamn fucking stupid... 
                            Okay, listen, man, I'll 
                            take care of this. I've got 
                          the money. We'll be open 
                            again by  
                            tomorrow. 
                            (pause) 
                            Yeah, I'm pissed, but not 
                          at you. 
                            (pause) 
                            Alright. Talk to you in the 
                            morning. 

  Kirby hangs up, his anger deflating. Before he can pocket 
  the phone, it rings again. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Hello? 
                            (pause) 
                            Bellinger? What's wrong? 
                            What's..? 


  Kirby pulls up and climbs out, weary, nerves jangling. The 
  front door of the house stands ominously open. Kirby 
    cautiously heads inside.   A moment later, Walter's car pulls up and stops.
