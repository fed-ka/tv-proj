Behind the wheel -- an intense young man with close-cropped
black hair, eyes hidden by sunglasses. Whatever he does for
a living, he does in a suit (not expensive but well-fit. But
we might also note that any extra suit cash has gone instead
into the silver-plated watch on his left wrist). Lean as a
rake, sallow in the cheeks, there is something insatiable
about him -- a hungry energy that won't let him go.
RAY LEVOI, late 20's, early 30's, pulls out of a threatening
traffic jam and races on the narrow right between thirty
cars and a cement girder.
Carl follows Ray into the big sparse room of unfinished
sheetrock walls. There is nothing in here but cardboard boxes,
and two people; a bearded HISPANIC MAN standing behind a
counter, writing on a clipboard. The other is a middle-aged
BLACK MAN in a purple silk shirt sitting in a chair with a
newspaper held open. He barely looks over the top of the
Wall Street Journal.
BLACK MAN
Hey, look who's here.
RAY
Louis, my man, what's happenin'?
Ray walks up to the counter. Carl lingers, fidgeting. Ray
sets his briefcase on the counter and click-clicks it open.
The Hispanic fence man looks inside, and begins pulling out
stacks of treasury checks.
FENCE MAN
Clean ones?
RAY
Immaculate.
Ray gestures to Carl and he nervously sets his briefcase on
the counter, fumbles with the first latch. The second. He
flips it open.
The fence man casts his eyes down at a neat cache of Grade A
Treasury. A lot of it. Then his eyes rise to Carl.
FENCE MAN
What ya got there, seventy-five
thousand?
CARL
A hundred and ten. Count it.
LOUIS (BLACK MAN)
Have the girl count it, we can't sit
around here countin' bonds, we got
things to do here.
The fence man pushes an intercom button and yells into a
speaker.
FENCE MAN
SALLLLY!
Carl's eyes flit to Ray. Ray's eyes flit to Carl.
Louis crushes his newspaper down and lifts a big Colt Python
from his lap just as --
A section of sheetrock kicks open and THREE FEDERAL OFFICERS
bust out, each clutching a handgun, SHOUTING inaudibly.
LOUIS
F.B.I.! Get your face on the fuckin'
floor! MOVE!
Carl startled, does an almost effeminate dip down to one
knee, but that knee is swept out from under him, slapping
him flat onto plywood where he is instantly frisked down by
the fence man who is wielding a 9 mm handgun. But the white
collar criminal is more stunned by the fact that --
Ray is walking across the floor with his hands in his pockets
over to the Mr. Coffee. He pours one, and adds some milk.
Turns and watches the bust while opening a packet of Sweet
n'Low.
RAY
Slam dunk.
LOUIS
Beauty. Beauty...
Ray rests his weight against the coffee station, takes a
careful sip. Carl is yanked to his feet by the fence man and
he stands there, looking at Ray, baffled. Completely shocked.
CARL
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu--
Larry. That's not even your name, is
it? What's your real name, you fucking
scumbag?
RAY
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number,
man. Just like the numbers on those
treasury checks. You stole from your
own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Coffee in hand, Ray walks briskly toward the door.
LOUIS
Sugar Ray.
Ray turns. Louis takes a few steps toward him, putting his
gun back in his waistband.
LOUIS
They want ya Home. Upstairs wants to
see ya.
Ray stands frozen, holding the door knob, and digesting what
are apparently influential words.
LOUIS
Make sure ya spell my name right.
Ray just stares for a moment. Then hurries out the door.
Carl, being arm-gripped by two agents and photographed like
a trout, gazes bewildered at the door.
CARL
(incredulous)
We just spent four months together...
I thought he was my friend... what
the fuck, man?
(even more incredulous)
He had dinner at my mother's.
CAMERA FLASHES at him, an agent on either side, striking a
natural pose.
8x10 BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS dealt like cards onto a table,
one on top of another.
1 -- an aerial shot of some wasteland.
2 -- a closer bird's eye of the same, what looks like a NASA
photo of Mars.
3 -- a vast expanse of the Great Plains.
ROBERT F. TULLY, Number-Two-in-Command, deals a fourth photo
onto the table. He is an understated, fatherly man, well-
manicured in cotton pencil-striped shirt, white-tab collar
and tie. The photos and maps and files a foot deep on the
huge table are neatly organized.
INTERCOM
SA Levoi, Sir.
TULLY
Please.
Seated, at the far end of the table, engrossed in the deep
spread of information, SA (Special Agent) FRANK COUTURE is
about to break the record for longest single ash on the end
of a cigarette and the smoke forces his eyes into tight,
concentrating, slits. "COOCH" as they call him in the Bureau
has seen thirty years in some rough "provinces". He has
survived the Hoover era and is a legend in the Sessions era
but survival has honed an edge. An edge with a touch of ironic
cop humor.
Ray enters, walks into a firm shake.
TULLY
Ray...
RAY
Mister Tully.
TULLY
Do you want a coffee?
RAY
No. No, no. Thank you.
Ray sits nervously across from Cooch who looks up from the
photos and studies the younger man through reading glasses
and cigarette smoke, and he looks at him like he doesn't
know who the hell he is or why he's sitting there.
TULLY
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal
Division.
COOCH
Oh, yeah -- right.
Cooch sticks his cigarette in his left hand, shakes with his
right.
TULLY
Ray this is --
RAY / TULLY
Frank Couture.
TULLY
That's right.
COUTURE
Hello, Ray.
The handshake is still locked. Cooch is still squinting at
the younger agent. Ray obviously knows something about Agent
Couture.
RAY
It's an honor.
Tully leans back in his chair, crosses his legs casually.
TULLY
Ray, we're taking you off the street.
We need you out in South Dakota.
Ray's enthusiasm suddenly deflates.
RAY
South Dakota...
(confused)
Did I do something unsatisfactory,
Sir?
COOCH
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame
that on your grandmother.
Ray looks completely baffled now, swinging a look from Cooch
to Tully.
TULLY
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.
(scanning file)
French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and
one-eighth American Indian.
COOCH
Sioux Indian, right?
RAY
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
TULLY
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Ray nods, looks from Tully to Cooch. What's going on here?
TULLY
Ray, there's been a homicide out in
an area known as The Badlands. Indian
Reservation.
COOCH
It's not the first. There's been
several. And our field office in
Rapid City is getting a lot of heat...
none of the investigations have turned
up jack shit.
TULLY
The main problem is, Ray, these people
are extremely distrustful of
outsiders, non-Indians. Relations
have not been amicable.
COOCH
Different culture. Hard to penetrate.
The Indians don't like white cops
poking around. And that's why we're
in a position where we have to bring
in an American Indian agent.
Tully straightens the edges of a bureau memorandum.
TULLY
With an Indian representative out
there, we hope to keep hostilities
dormant; this is a COINTELPRO,
Selective Operations Unit, and it'll
be easier on Agent Couture if you
can gain the people's trust and maybe --
RAY
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what
you're saying... I've got a little
Indian blood, that's true. But --
(laughing)
I am not an... an Indian. I can't
just go in and --
TULLY
-- your father was part Sioux.
A beat. Ray lowers his eyes to the photos.
RAY
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed
away when I was six.
COOCH
Seven.
Ray looks up at Cooch. Another uneasy beat. Cooch lights a
cigarette as if lighting a cigarette was a science.
COOCH
Don't worry about it, Ray. As long
as the people have proof that we
sent them one of their own, no one's
gonna ask you to weave baskets or
make it rain.
Ray sits before the files and photos, looking unsure. He has
come to garner a promotion but has just been sent to The
Graveyard. Or in the FBI argot, Indian Country.
Tully pivots his leather chair in a full circle and slaps an
assignment folder down in front of the young agent.
Cooch is at the wheel. Ray, passenger. His lap is a desk for
several folders, and he works through them as they drive.
Both agents eat a sandwich as they travel.
RAY
Eight murders in less than a year.
All of them Indian. All of them
unsolved. Is the law a non-entity
out here or what?
Cooch opens a folder that sits between them, and taking his
eyes off the road for a dangerous five seconds, locates some
photos, and hands them to Ray. Ray's expression tells us
they are not pretty.
COOCH
Those are two agents who went into a
reservation a few years ago to serve
a warrant. They were executed at
close range. That one there is a
police officer killed by the Mohawks
up in Canada more recently.
RAY
Jesus...
COOCH
The agents who have worked out here
say its like going into Nam.
Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language,
foreign customs... and you never
know when you might walk into a few
rounds. They hold a lot of old anger
for the white man out here.
Ray considers this as he looks out at the unfamiliar terrain
while on the RADIO, a D.J. speaks in LAKOTA LANGUAGE. Ray...
back at Cooch, studying his face.
RAY
Were you in Nam?
COOCH
Airborne. That's where they used to
get us agents from. Now we get 'em
from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League.
Accountants and computer whiz-kids.
Yuppies with guns.
(lights a smoke)
That's scary shit.
Ray smiles, sets the AC on high.
RAY
Not as scary as a Hoover man with a
computer.
Cooch throws a quick look Ray's way. And a smile. He
appreciates the sting of a right off a left.
COOCH
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've
loved you. He'd love anybody who
joined the bureau to, what was it?
"To enforce the laws of my country
and protect her interests"?
RAY
You crashed my file?
COOCH
No. I consulted it. We're going into
Indian Country, I wanna know what
kind of individual is covering my
ass. Don't you?
Ray has finished his sandwich. He wipes his hands on a
kerchief while taking in the sight of chalky buttes cramming
roadside.
RAY
You've been in the bureau for thirty
years. You survived The Hoov, the
Black Panthers and Abscam. I don't
see any bullet holes. That's good
enough for me.
Cooch looks at Ray, amused. He likes this guy. And then he
notices a look of growing consternation on his partner's
face.
RAY'S POV - MOVING
as they drive through the first settlement, a little, broken
and scattered community, littered with wrecked cars on blocks,
and overpopulated with hungry dogs. HEARTBEAT DRUM softly
under.
SIX INDIAN CHILDREN with dirty but beautiful faces and long
blue black hair run alongside the car, curious. One of them
YELLS SOMETHING we don't understand.
PAST the trading post -- a white man's store -- where SIX
OGLALA SIOUX -- four men, two women sit like wax figures,
only their eyes moving to light on the freshly waxed
government car.
A little house has a tipi erected beside it. And a satellite
dish. The house beside that one has been half chopped away
to feed the wood stove.
Poverty.
Ray lies in bed. Awake. He is hanging off the bed with a
file open on the floor and using the moon to light photos
and memorandums. And then he hears LAUGHTER outside. And
GLASS BREAK.
He gets out of bed quickly, snatching up his pants, putting
their on, and going to the window.
POV - OUT WINDOW:
SEVERAL LOCALS out in front of the bar help a middle-aged
INDIAN MAN out of the station wagon.
WHITE LOCAL
Where you goin'? Back to the res?
A young local bends down behind the Indian while another
shoves him, sending him tripping over the bent man and onto
his back in the dirt.
WHITE LOCAL
What ya doin'? You drunk?
MORE LOCALS come out from the bar, beers and drinks and
interested in what's going on.
REVERSE - RAY
at the window, observes. Cooch enters from the connecting
room, puffy-eyed but quickly buttoning his shirt. He shares
Ray's view.
COOCH
Let's take a walk.
Ray is transfixed.
Cooch and Ray sit in a booth with DENNIS VAUGHN, a strapping
local man, ranch-raised, and gentlemanly. In fact, downright
likeable.
DENNIS
So what type of salesmen are you
gentlemen anyway?
RAY
Liquor. We heard they like their
drink on the reservation, and we
were gonna see if we couldn't unload
some surplus on the way to Nebraska.
COOCH
Now keep that between us, Dennis,
cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny
Law they got here.
DENNIS
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want
you to meet a coupla fellas from
Denver.
BROOKS, a small, older man with a feed store cap and a clean
cowboy shirt, comes over with a beer and a pensive look on
his face. He pulls up a chair and positions himself at the
end of the booth.
DENNIS
Liquor salesmen. Be nice to them,
maybe they'll give you a sample of
some of that gin you like.
(to Ray)
He likes that Russian shit that --
BROOKS
They ain't liquor salesmen. They're
FBI.
Cooch and Ray don't flinch. Dennis does. He looks between
the two, cautiously.
COOCH
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow
like you, doing in a joint like this?
Let me buy you a glass of some of
that Russian shit you like.
DENNIS
FBI? What you investigatin'?
COOCH
A murder. On the reservation.
DENNIS
Again. Figures, man.
BROOKS
You'll never find out who did it.
COOCH
You underestimate me, Brooks.
BROOKS
No. You underestimate these grass
niggers. They're killing each other.
That's all they do. Get drunk and
kill each other. Then cover for each
other. Who gives a damn really as
long as they stay on their
reservation. You ask me, the
government shouldn't care one
particle.
DENNIS
You know how in your big cities, you
got your niggers and you got your
Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got
Indians. That's just the way it is.
COOCH
The only good Indian is a dead Indian,
does that old adage still hold true
out here?
Cooch laughs good-naturedly. Ray smiles. But Brooks looks
offended.
BROOKS
That set-to you saw out front, was
nothin' more than a message we were
sendin' to the sonsabitches that are
divertin' water from the river.
DENNIS
We got rights. We got a ranch just
up here.
Ray catches this. Glances a look off Cooch who works on a
cold draught beer.
RAY
Did any of you gentlemen know Leo
Fast Elk?
Both men shake their heads. Get quiet.
BROOKS
You fellas are here to investigate a
Indian crime, you should keep to
Indian land, and talk to them, not
us. But you wanna drink here and
shoot stick here, that's your right,
and we respect that.
(to Dennis)
Come on, Son, we're up on the table.
DENNIS
You fellas wanna play doubles?
Cooch shakes his head, distracted, and the two locals leave,
enroute for the pool table. Ray watches them go, curious.
Ray's at the wheel, looks intense as he studies the vast
expanse of slopes and rock formations and the rising sphere
of flame that lights the road in strange color. He is reading
a name list that he traps against the wheel.
RAY
Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks-
Dreamer.
(a dry run)
Hello, I'm looking for Hobert Standing-
Buffalo-That-Walks... Dreamer.
Ray pulls up a long dirt drive and parks.
SA Couture and SA Levoi sit inside the car, staking out this
little place far down a dirt road on the outskirts of the
settlement.
Cooch has the suspect's file on his knee.
RAY
Who is he?
COOCH
One of the leaders of the Warriors
of All Red Nations. Militant
organization.
He hands an open file over to Ray.
CLOSE ON - FILE PHOTO: a raging fire and six long-haired,
fist-raising Indians, yelling at the camera.
COOCH (O.S.)
The progressive Indians don't like
them because they want everybody to
go back to the old Indian ways, and
the old way Indians don't like them
because they use violence to get
attention.
RAY SHUFFLES TO
PHOTO 2 -- a big Indian in a wheel chair, holding a rifle.
He is shirtless under a vest and on his muscular right
shoulder there is a clearly defined tattoo of a circle with
an eagle feather through it.
PHOTO 3 -- a Close Up of the tattoo.
PHOTO 4 -- a propaganda flyer with the letters W.A.R.N. and
the same symbol -- perfect circle, pierced by a white eagle
feather.
RAY
White eagle feather through the
circle. That's their symbol.
COOCH
That's right.
Ray shuffles through more of the same with great interest.
RAY
They obviously wanted it to be known
that they offed Leo. Some kind of
statement.
COOCH
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head
through a glass door of the tribal
offices three months ago. And
threatened him several times since.
President Clear Moon and the regional
FBI feel he made good on that threat.
Cooch takes a long, tight breath then turns around in his
seat, coming up with an M-16. Ray lifts one of his own. He
looks out the car window.
RAY
I'd just like five minutes alone
with the motherfucker who hung that
flag upside down.
COOCH
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my
ship. Now: remember what I told you
about Nam? Watch the grass, watch
the trees, watch the shit house, be
on your toes, and if we get committed,
don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
RAY
Alright. Alright.
Cooch whacks a top clip into the M-16. Ray slams a clip in
his.
COOCH
It's show time.
Car doors open in skillful silence.
LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - CLOSER - NIGHT
and Ray maneuver toward the house, rifles ready. Cooch gets
under the picture window, sneaks a look. Nothing. He follows
Ray around the side.
POV:
off in a backfield, lit by a hot fire, a small round hut
covered in patchwork quilts, canvas and buffalo hide. A
strange mist floats around it, and from inside, voices are
heard -- A DRUMMING AND CHANTING in LAKOTA. And EAGLE SOUNDS.
Dozens of shrill whistles. Are there birds inside this thing?
REVERSE - RAY
and Cooch, kneeling in the weeds, look dumbfounded. And more
than a little unnerved.
RAY
(whispering)
What the hell is that?
NEAR THE INIPI LODGE
An INDIAN YOUTH DOOR TENDER with shoulder length hair falling
over a T-shirt, steps out of the dark and walks to the fire.
He prods it with a broken pitch fork.
He turns to get some more wood and walks right into an M-16,
trained chest level. Ray stares him down.
RAY
On the ground.
The boy drops boot camp fast.
Cooch moves up on the sweat lodge, looking quizzically at
it, trying to figure out how to open it. He grabs a canvas
flap at the front and after a moment's hesitation and a look
at Ray, he tears the flap away.
A BLAST OF 200 DEGREE STEAM explodes forth and Cooch dances
back, throwing up his rifle.
VOICE (O.S.)
(inside lodge)
Mitakue Oyasin!
GRANDPA SAMUEL REACHES, a rail-thin Sioux elder, appears
through the steam like a vision. Bent in the tiny doorway,
he searches out the interruption.
Cooch aims the M-16 at the old man.
COOCH
This is the FBI! Come on out of there
nice and slow. Let's move it! Hands
on your head!
Grandpa Reaches crawls out first, ignoring the "Hands on
your head" order from Cooch. His eyes move back and forth
between the two agents.
FIVE MORE INDIANS, from 16-45 come out, looking confused.
Cooch makes the towel-wrapped men spread out in a line. The
old man is speaking to the others in LAKOTA, and Ray steps
up to him, cuts him off.
RAY
Hands on your head, Sir. Come on,
come on...
The archaic figure just looks through him. Starts to walk
away. Ray takes his thin arm. He locks eyes with the old
man. Slowly, he obeys, raising his hands and laying them on
his head.
From the lodge, the last man emerges. It's Crazy Horse reborn
out of the burning sage. JIMMY LOOKS TWICE is in his mid-
thirties -- big, well over two-hundred pounds. But lean. His
braids fall nearly to his hips. His face is handsome but at
the moment, twisted in a full-blood's scowl.
LOOKS TWICE
(outraged)
What are you doing?
COOCH
James Looks Twice?
LOOKS TWICE
That's right. What are you doing
here? This is a religious ceremony
you're desecrating.
Looks Twice shoots hawk-like black eyes onto Ray.
RAY
We're FBI, James. We just need to
ask you a few questions.
LOOKS TWICE
We are in the middle of a sweat lodge
ceremony. Do you drag people out of
your churches when they're in the
middle of prayer?
COOCH
Let's take a walk, Jimmy. Come on.
Cooch takes a careful step behind Jimmy and cuffs him. Looks
Twice speaks to the others in LAKOTA, and they disband,
heading to a shade arbor where their clothes hang.
As Cooch starts marching Looks Twice toward the house, Ray
keeps an eye on the departing. One of them stops halfway to
the fence and turns. Grandpa Reaches looks at Ray with eyes
that have seen one hundred and one hard years in Indian
Country.
RAY
Go ahead. You can all go home.
And he follows Cooch and the cuffed Jimmy to the house.
COOCH
We just wanna take a look around
your place, Jimmy. We're not here to
bust your balls.
AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE
Cooch leads the half-naked suspect to the backdoor. Cooch
show: a warrant, tries the door but it is locked.
LOOKS TWICE
What's this about?
COOCH
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
LOOKS TWICE
You think I killed him? Cuz he was
an apple? Well, let me tell you
something about Leo, Man --
COOCH
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's
the key?
Jimmy doesn't answer. He glares with hatred into Cooch's
eyes.
COOCH
Ray, use the federal master key.
Ray steps up, gets ready to throw a frontkick at the door.
LOOKS TWICE
No. Don't do that. Don't deface the
property, man. The key's in there.
With his hands cuffed, he can only jerk his head toward a
big hole in the wall down near the foundation. Cooch quickly
drops to a knee and checks out the hole.
LOOKS TWICE
Inside... in the coffee can.
Cooch reaches in, probes.
COOCH
There's no coffee can in --
Something horrifying happens so fast, Cooch has no time to
react.
Whatever has taken his arm has done so with such force, his
body jolts like he's touched raw voltage. The South Dakota
BADGER rips through his leather jacket -- we get a glimpse
of its striped face and yellowed teeth -- through his shirt.
Through flesh, and deeper, GROWLING insanely while COOCH
HOLLERS in shock tries to pull free and --
Jimmy Looks Twice spins from the porch with a skillfully
executed back kick, knocking Ray off the step and to the
ground. The Indian bolts like a deer into the darkness.
Ray rolls in the grass, throwing his M-16 up. He hesitates.
But only for a moment before FIRING and decimating the corner
gutter, a junked car, several trees. But no sign of Jimmy.
Cooch falls back in the grass badly mauled. His arm has been
ripped open down to the bone.
COOCH
Jesus... Jesus...
Ray starts toward Cooch.
COOCH
Get him...
Ray takes off, crashing through weeds, into a stream, wading
through mud. He throws his flashlight left and right. He
crosses the river, shines the light in a field of wild sage.
Nothing. He runs like a sprinter, looking everywhere. But as
he enters an --
OPEN FIELD
all he finds is Jimmy's towel. He picks it up and looks around
the area, breathing heavily.
And then suddenly, something leaps up out of the grass. Ray
swings his M-16 up, ready to blast. But it is a DEER, taking
off into a mystical blue night. THE DRUM. Beating fast. Heavy.
TURTLESHELL RATTLE. EAGLE BONE WHISTLES.
IN THE YARD
Cooch traps his bleeding arm between his knees to stanch the
blood. He speaks quietly but firm into his radio, trying to
stay in control.
COOCH
(into radio)
Assault on federal officers. Suspect
has left the area. One officer down.
Issue a Fugitive Alert immediately.
Over.
RADIO
Has the officer been shot, X-22?
COOCH
No, the officer's been bitten by a
fucking badger, okay? Get a Fugitive
Alert fucking now! Over.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches sits in a taped and tuckered easy
chair, his alert black eyes moving from side to side. We
recognize him from the sweat lodge ceremony at Looks Twice'
although today he wears a straw cowboy hat giving him a more
youthful look despite a face like a map of the Badlands.
He wears a vest over a western shirt, baggy work slacks, old
cowboy boots.
His brown wrinkled hands run over the top of the Marlboro
pack as if he's reading braille.
Crow Horse sits across from him on a stool. Ray leans on one
of the plain green walls, looking uncomfortable. A three
foot adhesive fly strip hangs from the ceiling, thick with
dead ones. There is a black and white TV with Sesame Street
wailing, honking and guffawing through static.
Grandpa fixes his eyes on Ray for only split seconds at a
time but one gets the feeling he's doing an incredibly deep
reading of the young man. Slowly, he sits up -- focusing
intensely on Ray.
He begins to speak. A hoarse, strained, string of LAKOTA,
spoken like it used to be, gesturing toward Ray. When he
finishes, he sits back in his chair. Ray looks intrigued.
RAY
What did he say?
CROW HORSE
He wants to know if you ever watch
the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie
Monster is not to be trusted -- a
trickster.
Ray looks puzzled. Crow Horse laughs bull-wild as Grandpa
takes up a fly swatter and takes out a big horsefly. The old
man begins speaking Indian again.
CROW HORSE
He says there's something wrong with
Big Bird -- he's crazy,
(stops laughing)
He says you stopped the Inipi ceremony
last night...?
Crow Horse turns a questioning look at Ray. Ray doesn't
flinch.
CROW HORSE
But he is not unhappy with you because
he knows you.
RAY
He knows me?
CROW HORSE
He says he saw you in a vision some
time ago.
Crow Horse stops translating suddenly even though the old
man continues speaking. Crow Horse looks concerned, and ASKS
A QUESTION IN LAKOTA. We don't know what he's asking but the
tone is absolute amazement.
This question triggers an exchange between he and Grandpa,
the old one getting angry. Grandpa wins.
CROW HORSE
I guess he had this vision some time
ago, in the Moon of the Popping Trees --
uh, back in the winter. He says you
come from Wasi'cu city in the East
but that your people... way back...
are of the Minniconjou Sioux. But
you yourself don't know that.
Ray's brow is drawn tense as he stares at the old Indian,
absorbing the translation. Grandpa speaks more fervently
now, incorporating Indian sign. Each time Grandpa does the
hard Sioux HAND SLAP, Ray blinks.
CROW HORSE
He says he knew you'd be coming to
Bear Creek. He was told. It is the
will of Tunkasilia -- the grandfather
that you come here. He says let's
smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe,
symbol of truth. So that there will
be no lies between us.
The old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red stone
bowl from a beaded pipe bag. He joins the two together then
begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the Four Directions.
While this goes on, Ray fidgets.
RAY
What's he smoke in that?
CROW HORSE
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry,
we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture
in The Pipe. That's a white man's
myth. This is a sacrament.
The old man is offering the pipe to Ray.
GRANDPA
Mltaku Oyasin.
Ray looks at Grandpa. The old man offers the pipe again.
CROW HORSE
You don't smoke with him, it means
you're hiding something.
Ray takes the pipe, looks at it... then passes it to Crow
Horse. The big Indian takes it from Ray, giving him a long
eye, then offering the pipe to The Directions before smoking.
Crow Horse puffs hard, eyes closed, then slowly releases
some smoke upward. Ray watches it climb and fade. The old
man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle. He speaks.
CROW HORSE
He says Wakan. Sacred. Five hundred
year old turtleshell rattle, passed
down from the Grandfathers. Heavy
duty.
He shakes the rattle very slightly, moving it in front of
Ray. He speaks just above a whisper.
CROW HORSE
He says, it is good. The Spirits are
here. The Spirits want to know what
you're doing here?
Ray smirks.
RAY
Tell him I'm trying to find the man
who murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him
if he knows where he is.
Crow Horse asks the old man in Lakota. No answer. The pipe
is back to grandpa, and he offers it to the Directions, to
the Earth then upward before smoking himself. He begins to
speak again.
Passionately. In long glottal Sioux sentences, adding sign,
fingers crossing, brushing an arm, a slap here and there,
He is working himself into an excited state, and Ray keeps
looking at Crow Horse, very interested in the old man's
answer.
Finally Grandpa's breath comes up short and wheezing, he
ends his oratory with a solid hand slap.
RAY
What did he say?
CROW HORSE
He said he doesn't know.
RAY
He just did the Gettysburg Address
in Sioux. What did he say?
Crow Horse ignores him. Grandpa speaks again. More hand
language.
The old man is staring at Ray while whispering to Crow Horse.
He strokes his badger claw necklace.
Crow Horse looks at Ray and seems hesitant to translate this
new piece of information.
CROW HORSE
Uh... Grandpa likes to trade; no one
stops by here without gettin' stuck
in the old Indian barter. He, uh...
he likes your shades.
Grandpa smiles toothlessly. Ray who has his driving glasses
in hand, lifts them to say "these?" but Grandpa sees it as
an accepted deal, and swiftly removes his necklace. He holds
it out.
Ray slowly, hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses, and takes
the necklace. Crow Horse bursts into laughter and so does
Grandpa, enjoying a good trade. He draws a hand through the
air in a sort of horizontal karate chop, meaning done deal.
Ray looks confused. Out of his element. And out of his shades.
Another fly gets snagged on sticky tape.
In the dim light, a boot. A black cowboy boot. Up on the
dash. Bluejeans. T-shirt. Second hand leather. And a black
cowboy hat. Ray is staking out Jimmy's house.
Across the passenger seat and console is an M-16 rifle. On
his belt, a .357 Red Hawk. He yawns. From outside, he hears
a sound.
POV: down below the van, a small, patchy RES DOG with a
missing leg is looking up at him with his tongue long and
salivating.
RAY breaks off a piece of sandwich and drops it down to him
just as -- HEADLIGHTS catch his face. He slides down low,
watching an old pick-up truck creak onto the dirt road,
leading to Jimmy's.
POV: the truck parks. Someone jumps out, gracefully. Indian.
Long braid. Quick steps. Front door. Inside.
RAY lifts his radio.
RAY
X22. Read.
RADIO
Go ahead, Ray.
RAY
I have a pick-up truck. No plates.
Subject -- Indian -- entering
suspect's house. Over.
RADIO
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts
to leave the area, move in. And hold
him. Over.
Ray sets his radio down, unclips the leather guard on his
handgun. Picks up the Big Mac.
Ray, still in his field clothes sits, training binoculars on
the distant house. He opens a carton of milk, drinks some.
Then hears a whimpering. In the passenger seat sits the three
legged res dog. Ray has taken him with him. He drinks some
milk, then opens the carton up fully and sticks it out so
the dog can lap it up. Ray laughs in disbelief, shaking his
head.
RAY
For all I know, you're Jimmy. And
you're just waiting for a shot at my
jugular. Drink, Jimmy. Milk is good
for you --
The dog is lapping the milk, desperately. And then a ROARING.
A motorcycle.
IN THE SIDE MIRROR: Crow Horse, racing up on the left of the
van. Ray pulls his hat down low, and sits back. The motorcycle
passes on the left, slowing enough so that Crow Horse can
flip Ray the middle finger. Then he races on, far down the
road.
Ray sits there, shaking his head. He'll let it go. Bullshit.
He starts the car.
Grandpa sits in his chair, his black eyes moving smoothly
from side to side. Smoke enshrouds his ancient face, giving
the sense of another time and place. He speaks LAKOTA.
Crow Horse, sitting on a stool across from him, holds The
Pipe. He passes it to Ray who sits in a busted lawn chair
next to him. The room is dark as the sun sets out the window
in red and purple. Ray looks at the pipe. Grandpa will not
speak until Ray smokes. And so he does, drawing on the stem,
awkwardly.
HEARTBEAT DRUM as Grandpa speaks Indian.
CROW HORSE
He says, back behind Red Deer Table,
where the Elk-People-used-to-live...
there are strange creatures from
another world who eat stones... and
who will kill anyone who crosses
into this place.
Ray looks at Crow Horse, searching for a hint of lightness.
But there is only great reverence as he watches Ray blow
smoke upward.
CROW HORSE
He says, in the Yuwipi ceremony last
night, he saw you... going back into
the land beyond Red Deer Table. I
was with you. But that was all the
Spirits let him see so he doesn't
know if you were killed or not. But
he thinks you probably were.
Ray smirks as he passes the pipe to Grandpa. Crow Horse looks
nervous. Grandpa offers the pipe to the directions and then
disengages the bowl from the stem. He speaks again. Crow
Horse translates.
CROW HORSE
Go to the land where the Elk-People-
used-to-live and you will find the
answers you came here looking for.
But you must go as two. That is the
vision. I have spoken. And this is
so.
Grandpa leans closer to Crow Horse and whispers some Lakota.
CROW HORSE
He wants to trade.
(a beat)
He likes your watch.
Ray looks at Crow Horse, nervous.
RAY
I can't do that,
(explaining)
It's a Rolex.
CROW HORSE
A what?
And Grandpa is already holding out something to offer. It is
a cigarette. Grandpa offers it again.
RAY
I'm sorry, this is --
(loud to Grandpa)
-- this is very, very expensive.
It's --
(to Crow Horse)
Tell him this is an expensive watch.
Crow Horse tells the Old Man. Grandpa speaks Indian.
CROW HORSE
He says, you need to go on Indian
time. He says your watch is ruining
your life anyway.
Ray buries his hands in his jacket pocket. No way. Crow Horse
signs to Grandpa "no." Grandpa gets up, crosses between the
two young men, up to the TV set. He turns it on.
WHEEL OF FORTUNE
explodes in PINGS AND PONGS and a WOMAN'S SHRILL SCREAM.
Cooch, flushed in the face, mans the wheel. He wears only a
T-shirt which indicates, a desperate rush to the scene. His
eyes scan the surrounding homes and fields.
In the passenger seat, Ray sits, drinking a coffee. He looks
haggard.
COOCH
Bastards...
RAY
All I could think of was... not here.
I don't wanna eat it on an Indian
Reservation, three thousand miles
from home.
COOCH
He's out there. He's out there playing
Sitting Bull with us. I want the
motherfucker so bad I'm getting a
bleeding ulcer.
Ray turns around in his seat, looking off across dry land.
RAY
It may have been Maggie's way of
saying "get off my ass."
COOCH
She's that subtle?
RAY
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls
that's what her profile says.
COOCH
Well, she's running now, too. These
fucking people like to run, don't --
RAY
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
He does. Ray is turned around in his seat, staring off into
the distance.
Dark. Even during the day. Cigarette smoke. Sawdust. On the
archaic juke box, RANDY TRAVIS sings "Old 8x10" while behind
the bar, the BAR OWNER, an old man with long white hair and
beard, busies himself with leather work. SEVERAL WHITE LOCALS
sit on the old water drum bar stools.
Heads lift, turn when Ray enters in his "fraternizing" clothes --
jeans and boots, leather jacket. He scuffs up thick sawdust
as he heads to the furthest booth back where --
Crow Horse sits, alone over a bourbon and a beer. Ray
approaches carefully, upset by the sight. He slides into the
booth and point blanks the Indian.
CROW HORSE
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of
your Imagination.
RAY
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What
are you doing?
CROW HORSE
You're right about the old man. His
power's long dried up. He's supposed
to be a medicine man but he won't go
see the people. He says we changed,
and we don't listen. Well, he don't
go out and talk no more. I haven't
had a drink in three years but I
just turned my sobriety chip into
that man behind the bar, and this
Hoss is gettin' watered.
RAY
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in
here, Man.
CROW HORSE
Cuz I'm a skin?
RAY
Cuz you're a cop.
CROW HORSE
Not no more.
RAY
What are you talking about?
CROW HORSE
You tell me. You tell me who went to
the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian
Annihilation and said I was messin'
with your case, man. I don't give a
goddamn about your case.
RAY
And I don't give a goddamn about
whether you wear a badge or not,
Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
Crow Horse shimmers his black eyes onto Ray.
CROW HORSE
Still after Jimmy?
RAY
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
CROW HORSE
Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But
they cross over Benjamin Black Star's
prints. And he wasn't there until
six o'clock the mornin' after to get
eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy
wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
Ray just looks vacantly at Crow Horse. Crow Horse resents
the vacancy.
CROW HORSE
Look, man... you better bust Jimmy
and get out before somebody shoots
up more than your car next time.
Ray glares at him.
RAY
Next time I'll be ready. You get the
word to who ever it is.
CROW HORSE
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
Ray doesn't blink.
CROW HORSE
You think you was sent here cuz you're
a good cop?
RAY
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian.
And a good cop.
Crow Horse leans toward Ray and speaks more quietly.
CROW HORSE
You ever think that maybe you was
sent here cuz the FBI's need one
good reason to take out the entire
Warrior Movement. And what better
reason than one of their men, gettin'
blown away on the res. A low-rent,
expendable public servant sent in to
take a bullet for his country.
Ray is fuming. He can't believe what he's hearing, what's
being insinuated, but he's giving it thought and it's getting
him angry. He smashes a hand down on the table.
RAY
I'm sick of your shit --
RANCHER (O.S.)
I'm sick of the two of ya timber
niggers spewin' off.
Standing over the booth is a long, tall RANCHER'S SON. Rangey
with red curly hair tucked under a BLACK HILLS CLASSIC cap,
and arms built by tractor work. And behind him, TWO OLDER
RANCHERS fall in. And ANOTHER YOUNG MAN, grinning with
amusement.
Ray and Crow Horse look up.
CROW HORSE
Sorry, we don't speak United States.
RANCHER'S SON
Yeah, well I do. Get the Jesus up,
and get the Jesus out or I'm gonna
go out to my truck and come back
with my hardware.
RAY
Woh, hold on there, Jack, you're --
RANCHER'S SON
-- don't "jack" me, Squanto. I'll
bury your lazy ass right here.
Ray realizes now that they think he's Indian, too. Crow Horse
sees this revelation and complicates it by suddenly speaking
LAKOTA to Ray.
The rancher grabs Ray by the cheeks.
RANCHER'S SON
I'm talkin' to --
Ray decks him. Backhands him in the solar plexus then, lays
a burner of a Quantico roundhouse to his ear, knocking him
across the bar, over a mop and bucket and into sawdust.
The others start to fall at him but someone has jumped in,
holding them back, and sticking himself in the way. It is
Brooks. The old timer Ray met his first night here.
BROOKS
No! No, you butt holes! He ain't
skin! He AIN'T SKIN!
CROW HORSE
Yeah he's In'dn. Miniconjou Sioux.
The rancher's son who is coming back with a broken beer
bottle, slows his step and shifts his eyes from Brooks to
the young fed There is a lot of heavy breathing. But no
talking just yet. The young rancher eyes Ray.
RANCHER'S SON
You ain't Indian?
Ray just stands tense, staring at him. And it's strange.
Because he hasn't really looked like he has any Indian blood
up to this moment. But dressed the way he is, and his eyes
glaring, face drawing tense, he might pass for a breed
although that's probably the Italian. But Ray doesn't answer
the question. Crow Horse starts laughing. Drunkenly.
OLDER RANCHER
What's so damn funny?
CROW HORSE
Well, it's just that the cavalry
used to always threaten the Lakota.
The cavalry ain't around anymore.
The Lakota still are.
RANCHER'S SON
I got no trouble tellin' where you
come from, Fat Red.
Crow Horse rises and walks unsteadily across the floor,
leaving the bar. Brooks is whispering to the others,
apparently about who Ray is. The bar man comes up to Ray,
holding a tray, on which sits a shot and a beer. Ray looks
at it for a moment.
BAR MAN
Sorry. On the house.
Ray knocks the tray out of his hand, spilling beer and whiskey
all over the bar man and the locals around him.
And he walks out, leaving the locals confused.
Ray looks strung-out as he drives. If it's not the conflict
at the Butte, it's the dangerous seed Crow Horse planted,
and it is playing with his mind. He is on his RADIO.
RAY
No plates. No registration. Serial
numbers removed. And all prints washed
off by the river. That's great. This
is turning out to be a walk in the
park, do you know that?
RADIO
(woman agent)
Come back?
RAY
Never mind.
But before he hangs the radio. IT CUTS BACK IN.
RADIO
Ray. X22.
RAY
I read, Cooch.
RADIO
Remember that upside down flag back
at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it
down.
RAY
Good.
RADIO
They took it down, set fire to it,
and threw it on the doorstep of room
13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your
room.
Ray seethes quietly as he drives.
RADIO
We traced the number of the truck
that dumped it, and it belongs to
one Maggie Sanders, also known as
Maggie Eagle Bear. She's been all
over the res, riling up the
traditionals, telling them not to
break, and to keep Jimmy in hiding.
She's a problem now. And she's yours.
Get her off the reservation.
Ray keeps driving.
Ray sits behind the wheel, going through files on his lap,
photographs of Indians. And thinking hard.
RAY
Anyone who fought or spoke out against
it... wound up dead or in jail.
Ray looks out the window toward the monument.
RAY
(to himself, flustered)
That was 1868, Maggie...
Exhausted, Ray lays his head back on the seat, and lets a
long, constricted breath free. THUNDER ROLLS like the slow,
deep roar of some giant bear up in the hills. He opens his
eyes, looks out the window.
POV: rain is coming down, and Maggie is getting the children
into the back of her truck. She helps them get a tarp over
their heads. Then as Yellow Bird pulls himself into the cab
of the truck, she hefts the wheelchair and two boys load it
in.
She gets in, starts up, and rolls off down the sloping road.
Ray jumps awake. Cooch is POUNDING on the window. And the
three-legged dog inside is BARKING. Ray quickly rolls the
window down, letting in THUNDER.
Cooch starts to say something then takes note of Ray's peaked
face. Sweat runs down his temples, beads at his nose.
COOCH
Jesus, you alright?
RAY
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't
believe it. I --
COOCH
Never turn your radio off! I thought
I was gonna find you scalped! Damn
it!
RAY
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
COOCH
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got
Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
And Cooch runs to his car. Ray fires the car's big engine
and takes off behind Cooch who is driving a fed Chevy. CRAZY
HEARTBEAT DRUM INTO --
The holy man is sitting in his chair, smacking Flies with a
swatter. Tonight he wears a black reservation hat and stares
vacantly at the TV where RONALD MACDONALD swings a giant
baseball bat, and falls on his face, bouncing back up. And
then BOOM!
The door is open and Cooch leads Miles, Sherman and Ray
inside. Cooch has a gun on the old man.
COOCH
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!
The old man slowly removes his hat and hangs it on a knee.
Carefully he places his wrinkled hands on his thinning white
hair. His eyes seek out Ray who stands in the doorway, M-16
in hand, looking concerned. He stares at Ray.
Cooch storms into a back bedroom, Miles moves to a window.
Sherman stands over the old man.
SHERMAN
Where is he, Sam? Where's Jimmy?
Grandpa looks at Sherman, ignores him, looks back at Ray.
SHERMAN
He's a medicine man, Ray. The
"spiritual leader" of the Warriors.
That right, Sam?
With RADIO TRANSMISSIONS crackling through the house, Cooch
comes back down the hall, and heads to the door.
COOCH
Trailer's clean, let's go.
Ray starts to follow but he sees Sherman pick something up
from near Grandpa. The 500 year-old turtleshell rattle.
Grandpa's eyes widen slightly.
SHERMAN
You been the one making it rain like
that, out there, Sam?
RAY
Hey, put that down.
SHERMAN
Can you make Jimmy outrun an M-16,
Sam?
RAY
Sherman!
Sherman drops the turtleshell rattle on the linoleum floor.
Then drives his heel into it, CRUSHING the fragile
turtleshell.
Ray grabs him and slams him into the tin wall. Miles gets
between them, grabbing Sherman.
MILES
EASY, MEN! HEY! --
RADIO
HE'S ON THE ROOF! HE'S ON THE FUCKING
ROOF! COME ON GUYS, COME ON, GUYS!
They're out the door, leaving the old man to sit looking
down at the shattered rattle. He closes his eyes.
Ray closes the door, and stands there. He seems to be having
trouble breathing. He looks down at his boots. There is
something on the floor. Something that has been slipped under
the door earlier. He just stares down at it. Then slowly
stoops.
CLOSE ON: the polaroid of the res car he gave to Maggie
earlier. She
has returned it. He turns it over. Written across the white
backing of the photo, in dark black marker is the name --
YELLOW BIRD.
Ray stares at this for a moment then hurries over to boxes
of files on the bed. He rummages like a nervous thief and
comes up with a folder. He flips through it, casting off
files and 302's and profiles and finally stopping on --
The 8x10 BLACK AND WHITE of Richard Yellow Bird seen earlier.
Sitting in his wheelchair, Red Power cap on, tattoos marring
big arms. And under it a DOUBLE MUG SHOT stamped LEAVENWORTH
PRISON. Under that ANOTHER PRISON MUG SHOT stamped SIOUX
FALLS PRISON. And under that a --
THIRD MUG SHOT stamped "PAROLED."
Ray, his eyes fixed on this one, takes a few steps and sits
on the end of the bed. He then stuffs the file back in a
box, and takes off toward the door.
Yellow Bird, in a T-shirt that reveals twenty different ink
tattoos, rolls himself across the warped floorboards to a
cheese crate where his eye glasses sit. He puts the thick
bifocals on and focuses resentfully on Ray in the ochre
flicker of the dirty room.
YELLOW BIRD
What ya want?
RAY
Must be a bitch getting around in
that wheelchair. How long you been
in it?
YELLOW BIRD
Since I got a iron pipe put across
my knees, man. Fight with three
wasi'cus, ya know.
RAY
At Sioux Falls Pen?
YELLOW BIRD
No, that was Leavenworth. This --
(shows a scar)
was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
RAY
Leavenworth a tough joint?
Ray walks across the room, his eyes on a covert mission.
YELLOW BIRD
You ever try solitary confinement?
RAY
No. Can't say that I have, Richard.
Richard do you know why I'm here?
YELLOW BIRD
Washington sent ya. I know that.
RAY
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard.
They sent me here because this whole
thing has been fucked. Do you know
what I mean when I say this whole
thing has been fucked, Richard?
Yellow Bird stares at Ray.
RAY
An arrangement was made between you...
and us. Do you remember that
arrangement?
Yellow Bird looks at Ray, strangely, shaking his head. Ray
starts to look like maybe the game's not working. Like maybe
this doesn't add up. But --
YELLOW BIRD
I'm here, ain't I?
Ray lets a tense breath out.
RAY
Not for long, Richard. You got early
parole under the stipulation that
you would help us in a situation,
and you didn't deliver.
YELLOW BIRD
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Ray sits in a busted chair, reaches down to his ankle holster
and pulls out a .38. He holds it, resting it on the arm of
the chair. He strains to look out through the boarded window.
Yellow Bird fidgets in his chair.
RAY
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
YELLOW BIRD
What's with you people? Why do ya
have to fuck with my head all the
time? I came through, man.
RAY
Get up out of the chair, and walk
toward the backdoor, Richard.
YELLOW BIRD
(not moving)
I get thrown in solitary until I
don't know my own fuckin' name, and
then you people tell me I can beat
nine years if I help you. I helped
you!
RAY
Get up!
Yellow Bird stands. He takes a step forward. Limping. He's
got leg problems but he can walk. Heels first. And bowed.
But he can walk. He is shaking.
YELLOW BIRD
They said I'd never see FBI again,
and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I
don't feed ya information on the
Warriors, it's back to the pen. I
don't do this, back to the pen. Your
word against my word. Against a con
Indian's word. I really got a chance,
man, right?
RAY
They sent me here, Richard because
they said you didn't hold up your
end of the arrangement, and I have
to transport you back to Leavenworth.
YELLOW BIRD
(crying)
What the fuck, man? What do you people
want? I did what you wasi'cu's told
me to do.
RAY
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
Yellow Bird wheels.
YELLOW BIRD
No way. No fuckin' way.
RAY
How the hell do you know?
YELLOW BIRD
I blew his back out with a buffalo
gun, that's how I know! Now you're
gonna say I didn't, so you can throw
me back in solitary?
Ray is trying hard not to reveal his horror at this
confession, at this understanding of the machinery. He sits
there with his gun, blinking away sweat that beads at his
brow. Yellow Bird is weeping in a highpitched voice that
doesn't match his great bulk.
RAY
The men who came to see you at
Leavenworth. The one's who made the
arrangement... who were they? Maybe
I can talk to them.
YELLOW BIRD
Miles. Three other suits. That's all
I know 'em as -- suits. Were you
there?
RAY
You turned Leo over on his face. But
the coyotes must've turned him back
over, man, cuz his spirit is out.
It's out, and it knows.
YELLOW BIRD
What do you know about spirits? You
ain't no In'dn.
RAY
Leo knew something heavy and was
trying to tell Jimmy. But you must
not know how serious it was or you
would have delivered. Do you realize
what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do
you?!
YELLOW BIRD
I took him out before he got the
chance. He didn't say nothin' about
Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in
the dirt. Forever.
RAY
What's Tashka Sha, speak English,
speak English!
YELLOW BIRD
Red Deer Table! What's with you,
man?
Ray grabs onto these words, rolls them silently on his lips
And now Yellow Bird is getting suspicious of the fed.
YELLOW BIRD
Wait a minute. Wait -- what are you
doin'? You ain't a FBI. You ain't
the law. Let me see your --
Ray snaps out his gun, straight-armed.
RAY
I'm the fucking law!
Yellow Bird jumps back, raising his hands.
RAY
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
YELLOW BIRD
All I know... is I did what I did...
and I ain't in solitary, gettin'
pumped up with downer, gettin' beat
to shit. But I tell you what, Suit.
Take me back. Cuz I can't take this
shit no more.
And then HEADLIGHTS pierce the gaps in the boarded windows.
Yellow Bird collapses against the wall, bangs his head off
it. He lets a long, pained, cry escape from under his breath
and he begins a slow slide down the wall, to the floor.
Ray peers out the cracks in the boards.
YELLOW BIRD
Man, I don't know who the fuck I am
no more.
Ray gets up, putting his gun away and heading to the door.
He stops and looks back at the Indian, sitting on the floor,
clutching his knees, staring into the kerosene flicker.
RAY
You and me both.
Yellow Bird looks at him, his glasses foggy, his face
contorted And Ray leaves.
Ray reaches over to the passenger seat and pulls up the M-
16. He lays it across his lap. Looks in the rearview again.
Then makes a sudden sharp turn.
He pulls off the road quickly, throwing up dust into the
already foggy night, the car goes out of control.
Ray skids through the dirt, trying to stop -- he can't --
and the Le Baron fishtails, smashing into a chain-link fence.
And coming to a stop.
Breathing as if he's been running not driving, Ray looks
behind him to make sure he lost the car. He did. When he
turns back to his wheel, he sees --
THROUGH THE CHAINLINK FENCE
lit by his headlights: THE WOUNDED KNEE gravesite. He is
right up on the arch, and the tall stone marker beyond it.
Ray and Crow Horse are quiet as they eat up the dirt roads.
CROW HORSE
Maybe the old man's visions are still
strong.
Ray nods, concentrating. After a time:
RAY
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
CROW HORSE
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin'
sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge.
Ya never know when.
RAY
Just before we caught Jimmy... I had
a dream that I was being chased. And
I was running with other people. Old-
fashion Indian people. I got shot in
the back. Like Leo.
When Crow Horse doesn't respond, Ray looks over and finds
him staring. He looks back to the road. And when he looks
back at Crow Horse, he is still staring at him.
CROW HORSE
Where was this?
RAY
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where
I was, and that's where the dream
was. Why?
CROW HORSE
You were running with the old ones.
At The Knee. Heavy duty.
RAY
Well, it was just a dream, I --
CROW HORSE
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man?
Who are you?
RAY
What do you mean?
CROW HORSE
Nothin'. Forget it.
Crow Horse looks out the window as if to avoid Ray who is
confused by the Indian's smoldering. After a moment, Crow
Horse looks at him.
CROW HORSE
You had a vision. You had yourself a
vision. A man waits a long time for
a vision. Might go his whole lifetime
and never get one. And along comes
some instant Indian with a Mastercard
and brand-new shoes, has himself a
vision.
RAY
Sorry.
CROW HORSE
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
RAY
We've driven a long way. Where is
this place?
CROW HORSE
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know,
just one of them, what do ya call
'em, fitful dreams?
RAY
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
Crow Horse feels better. He looks out the window, nodding.
But it doesn't last long.
CROW HORSE
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got
sign from the old ones.
RAY
What the hell do you want me to do?!
CROW HORSE
Stop.
Ray brakes. Crow Horse is looking past him. Ray turns. The
spectacular mesa that we have admired with every sunrise,
looms massive now that we are under it. Moonlight falls on
it. And the HEARTBEAT DRUM pulses from it.
Crow Horse walks over to Ray's window, his jeans and boots
muddy. No one speaks for a long moment, the night filled by
crickets. And that one dog.
RAY
This Clear Moon's house?
CROW HORSE
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum.
You better wait here. He don't trust
the white man.
Crow Horse crosses the street. Ray sits there, and he looks
almost hurt by this statement. But he is the white man. But
he is Indian. He lets a long breath escape, rubs at a temple.
He takes out a smoke. Tries to light it. His hands are shaking
too badly. But he gets it lit, and sits tense, looking in
his rearview.
Oliver Clear Moon sits in a chair, his strong Indian mouth,
beginning to tighten at the jowls.
Across from him, Crow Horse sits on the edge of a couch.
MRS. CLEAR MOON, a rotund, gentle woman brings him a coffee.
A TEENAGE GIRL in a men's extra-large T-shirt stands in the
hall, looking at him.
Clear Moon in pajamas, rises, and with a coffee in hand,
starts walking in slow steps toward the kitchen. He loses
control before he gets there and hurls the cup across the
room into the sink, smashing it. He wheels and faces Crow
Horse. He SPEAKS LAKOTA. Asking questions. Crow Horse SPEAKS
LAKOTA. Answering him.
Mrs. Clear Moon, understanding, shakes her head in disbelief
and her eyes begin to well. Oliver, walking back to his chair,
sits, and thinks for a moment. MORE LAKOTA. He gets up, goes
to a drawer and rummages. He sits again, and tosses something
onto the coffee table. It is a badge. A tribal police badge.
Ray nervously awaits Crow Horse's words as he appears at the
window again. The Indian shows hope in his tired eyes.
CROW HORSE
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's
callin' council fire. All the old
chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta
be at Grandpa's place in two hours.
We need to get the tribe together.
We need to block this thing.
RAY
What we need... is Richard Yellow
Bird.
Crow Horse looks at Ray who stares dead ahead.
An empty wheelchair.
Ray has cast off his field clothes and is halfway into one
of his cleaner suits. He looks haggard but still buoyant,
his eyes piercing. The connecting door creaks open and Cooch
walks in. The SAC is freshly showered and he is fidgeting
with a Windsor knot. He studies his number two man, says
nothing for a moment but is obviously holding something down.
His face is a red hue.
COOCH
(extra casual)
Couldn't sleep, Ray?
Ray looks at Cooch. When he speaks, his voice is dry.
RAY
No...
Cooch crosses the room, and picks up Ray's jeans which look
like they went through a sandlot tackle match in a mud hole.
Ray tucks his clean shirt in; watching Cooch.
RAY
I had to finish something with Crow
Horse.
Cooch walks up to Ray slowly and takes his face in his hand,
turning it toward lamp light to study the bruise along his
left eye, a residual from a Crow Horse hook.
COOCH
That's where you were. You had to go
back and have it out with the Indian
law...
Ray nods, and Cooch slowly breaks a smile. An insecure smile
but a smile just the same. He starts to laugh.
COOCH
You fucking hot head, we can get in
trouble for that.
Cooch laughs in amusement and Ray's face crinkles into a
grin as he lowers his eyes, wiping a paper towel over his
face. And then, suddenly, Ray lunges at Cooch.
He slams the Agent in Charge against the hollow wall, and
holds him there. His eyes wild.
RAY
Why didn't you tell me what we were
doing here?
Cooch is stunned.
RAY
We're running a cover-up and you
didn't --
Cooch suddenly explodes, throwing Ray off of him and sending
him reeling back against the sink. He points a finger at his
charge.
COOCH
You ever put your hands on me again
and you'll be doing the books for a
baitshop in the fucking Everglades,
Mister.
RAY
You didn't tell me about Red Deer
Table --
COOCH
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
RAY
What is it? It's genocide, that's
what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some
U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for
the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
Cooch's eyes go frighteningly cold. He can't believe what
he's hearing.
COOCH
Jesus Christ. What are you doing?
What the hell were you doing out
there?
Ray says nothing. He just stands there, against the sink,
breathing like a fighter against the turnbuckle.
COOCH
This was a Selective Operations Unit,
Agent Levoi. There is classified
information pertaining to our national
security. You don't question that,
you don't go digging into that shit --
that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
RAY
-- if they mine uranium there, these
people will have no place left to
go...
COOCH
We were sworn in on the Constitution
to protect federal matters, Ray. I
don't know about uranium, I don't
know about Red Dog Table -- all I
know is we did our job. It's over.
RAY
We neutralized anybody with a voice.
Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who
was standing in the way of the land.
Is that it?
COOCH
No. We neutralized enemies of the
United States. Anti-American radicals
who have killed federal officers out
here!
Ray turns to the sink, turns the faucet on to get some water
on his face. The water only trickles into the basin.
COOCH
Jesus, Ray. You think I don't like
the Indians? Not true. These were
noble people but their day is gone.
They're a conquered nation. They
want all of America back but they
can't even keep the garbage out of
their own front yards. It's sad,
Ray. But it's just the way it is. We
have to function as a colonial police
force out here.
Ray leans on the sink, watching the water start to spurt
free. He shuts it off. Turns to look at Cooch. And it is
then the door opens -- some knocking after the door is already
opened -- and SA Miles enters.
MILES
You gentlemen ready -- hi, Ray.
COOCH
Yeah, we're ready.
Ray doesn't turn from the sink.
Ray gets behind the wheel, looks at his watch. He is
panicking. He starts the car, reverses, slams into drive.
RAYS POV: swerving and reckless as he races forward. Sherman,
walking around to one of the cars has to run out of the way.
The other agents clear out, looking in confusion as Ray cuts
a hard U -- sweeps PAST THE BAR, SMASHES INTO AND THROUGH
the old hitching post -- and HEADS TOWARD the reservation
which lies vast before him.
Ray is leaving little transitional developments and trailers
behind. His eyes bore into the road before him, looking for
a sign of Crow Horse, and in the rearview for a sign of his
FBI mentor.
With Crow Horse half-passed out in the passenger seat, Ray
keeps the wheel steady. And then his RADIO STATICS.
RADIO
X21, please read. Ray. Ray. X21,
please read. This is Cooch. Please
come in, Ray. Where are you?
Ray just stares down at the radio, keeps the pedal floored.
The throws the wheel left.
With Ray driving like a maniac, Crow Horse is turned around
in his seat, watching the federal cars spreading out, the
chopper moving in.
CROW HORSE
They got us sealed. What are we gonna
do?
RAY
We're going for The Stronghold.
Crow Horse looks at him.
RADIO
(Cooch)
Ray. Can you hear me? You are fucked.
There's no way out of this. If you
won't listen to your own laws, then
listen to this:
(static: a new voice)
This is President Clear Moon. This
nation does not want your sympathy.
You cannot use this reservation as a
sanctuary. Stop where you are now.
Ray and Crow Horse exchange a look.
RADIO
(Cooch)
Whatever you are trying to do is
futile, Raymond. You have nothing.
Nothing.
Ray picks up the mic as he cranes to keep an eye on the
rearview.
RAY
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
RADIO
(Cooch)
Yellow Bird committed suicide at
three o'clock this morning. Some
gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him
into a corner. You're playing a losing
game. Pull over.
Ray takes the mic and for some reason, he's putting it inside
his jacket near his shoulder where he keeps his leather.
Crow Horse looks at him, puzzled. And then the sound comes
forth, the static crackling of a micro-cassette recorder.
RECORDER
(Ray)
How the hell do you know?
(Yellow Bird)
I blew his back out with a buffalo
gun, that's how I know. And now you're
gonna say I didn't and put me back
in solitary?!
Ray keeps the tape running into the radio as he drives through
rugged Badlands. Crow Horse, stunned by the voice, eyes Ray
as the tape rolls.
Cooch and Clear Moon stare in horror at the radio.
RADIO
(Yellow Bird)
You people tol' me I could beat nine
years if I helped you. I helped you!
(rewinding)
I could beat nine years if I helped
you. I helped you!
Cooch is shaking his head in vitrified disbelief. He slams
the pedal almost through the floor.
The tape ends and Ray now lifts the mic to his mouth.
RAY
(into mic)
Fuck you.
And he too, buries the accelerator.
Crow Horse is turned around, looking at the pursuit.
RAY
Walter.
Crow Horse turns, sees what Ray is looking at.
POV: The Stronghold -- a narrow opening in hulking rock
formations. Large enough for a car to get in, and keep
followers out.
CROW HORSE
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in
there, we got a chance.
RAY
We're in there. We're in there --
just ahead, the earth is gone. A wavering heat pond turns
out to be a crevice and they nose down into it, burying the
front end in sand and rock. WINDSHIELD SHATTERS.
After THREE TRIES, he gets the engine started. He pulls his
gun off his waistband, goes to lay it on the passenger seat
and finds something there.
Grandpa's sacred caanunpa. The Pipe. Symbol of truth. Ray
looks out the window at the old man who is watching him with
those sharp black eyes. Ray lifts his hand, holds it flat,
and does the Sioux done deal sign.
