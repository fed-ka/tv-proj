  Keegan heads out of the building rubbing his aching jaw.  As 
  he walks away, he passed a well-dressed man heading for 
  Mikki s building.  Keegan has a sense that this is Mikki s 
  next customer.  He turns and watches the man head inside.  
  His face goes dark - he considers confronting the man - but 
  what would that achieve?  He turns and walks away.  



    Establishing shot.  



  MR. AND MRS. WU, a Chinese couple in their fifties, are the 
  proprietors of this small cafe in Echo Park.  A wall-mounted 
    television chatters away in Mandarin.  Mr. Wu watches as he sets 
  tables.  Mrs. Wu checks her watch - there s a task she s almost 
    forgotten.  She picks up a broom and raps it against the ceiling 
  repeatedly.  Her husband sees this and his face registers 
    annoyance.



  Keegan exits onto the sidewalk from the stairs that lead to the 
    apartments above the cafe.  He s unshaven, his hair is askew, 
  and he s decked out in a maroon robe and brogues.  A passerby 
  turns and watches as he steals a newspaper before ambling into 
  the cafe.



  The Wu s van drives by.  



  We descend from the heavens through the face of a church to 
  discover 3 MOURNERS who are amongst many people with money and 
  power draped in black.  They are distracted by the sound of a 
  roaring engine.  

  The Wu van screeches up to the curb and shudders to a halt in 
  front of a LIMO.  (The van features large, aspirational Maoist 
  portraits of the younger Mr. and Mrs. Wu.)  

  Keegan get out of the van:

                                KEEGAN
                      (into phone)
                Am I down?  Roy, am I down?!  Roy 
                can you hear me?!  Am I down you 
                  bastard?!!

                              ROY (V.O.)
                Yes, you re down!  

  Only then does Keegan notice the 3 Mourners staring at him.  

                                KEEGAN
                I was just saying how down I feel 
                today.  So, so ... down.  God bless 
                him.

                Thanks, sorry for the incon -   

  Mr Wu peels the van away.  

  The Mourners look away and Keegan notices MARCUS BARZMANN, 
  50, the Mayor of Los Angeles who resolutely ignores Keegan as 
  he approaches the Church

  He is approached a SMALL GROUP OF REPORTERS who are asking 
    incomprehensible questions about someone called MURRAY. 

                                MARCUS
                      (trying to contain anger)
                Now is not the time.  I have no 
                comment.

  Mourners, including Keegan, arrive at Frances  comfortable home.  



  ROY (40, a mountain of a man) sits nursing a beer.  He glances 
  up at the news playing on a TELEVISION OVERHEAD.

                                ANCHOR (V.O.)
                City Hall so far remains in a state of 
                stunned silence after the arrest of 
                the Mayor s top economic advisor, 
                Graham Murray, for both murdering and 
                eating the remains of a young 
                  accountant, Paul Wilson.  Murray, seen 
                here with the Mayor on election night 
                three years ago, was not only said to 
                be the chief architect of the city s 
                  financial rescue plan, he s also an 
                  extremely close confidant to Mayor 
                  Barzmann.  A memorial service was held 
                for Paul Wilson this morning in 
                Pasadena - 

  (FOOTAGE of Paul Wilson s funeral - including the arrival of his 
  parents and his sister.)

                You re defending the cannibal?  

                                KEEGAN
                Any advice?

                              ROY
                Wear long sleeves.  They say he s 
                  brilliant at picking the stock market.  
                Maybe you should ask him for a couple 
                of tips.  

                                KEEGAN
                        (motions to the bartender)
                Maybe I will.  Can I get a scotch on - 

                              ROY
                No time.  Come on.

  Roy pushes away from the bar and walks through a back room, into 
  an alleyway.  Keegan nods grimly and follows:

                              ROY (CONT D)
                You going to Billy s thing Thursday 
                night?

                                KEEGAN
                I guess.  

                              ROY
                He likes those fancy English TV shows. 
                I was thinking the Downtown Abbey box 
                set maybe.

                                KEEGAN
                Downton.

                              ROY
                Huh?

                                KEEGAN
                It s Downton Abbey.  Not Downtown.

  They re in the alley now.  Roy turns to face Keegan.

                              ROY
                Funny, I didn t realize that ... 
                You re sixty-seven thousand in the 
                hole, Key.  Victor says he s gonna 
                need half by the end of the month.  

  This is bad news - but before Keegan can react - Roy punches him 
  hard in the gut.  Keegan doubles over.  He reaches out, gasping - 
  trying to convey an urgent thought before Roy strikes anew.  

                                KEEGAN
                Roy - big favor - there s a chance I 
                may need root canal, so if you could 
                stay away from this side of my -      

  Roy smashes Keegan in the jaw - on that side.  The pain arcs 
  like lightning through Keegan's body and he falls to the ground.  

                              ROY
                See you Thursday night.  You need a 
                ride?  

  Keegan nods and Roy strolls away.  Keegan stays on the ground, 
  blood trickling out of his mouth.  He coughs and spits out a 
  tooth.  He picks it up and looks at it.  Then he feels his jaw.  
  It s fine.  No more pain.  He smiles.  Finally - a break.  

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

  ACT TWO

  FADE IN:



  Keegan gets off a bus and joins the city s masses as they pour 
  into office buildings.  



  Keegan passes by a second hand book shop and sees a heavily 
  loved edition of the T.S. ELIOT OMNIBUS in the window.  He 
  smiles and enters the shop.                                                     22.



  His book purchase in hand, Keegan presses Mikki s buzzer.   

                                FEMALE VOICE
                      (over speaker)
                Hello?  

                                KEEGAN
                  Surprise.  I m actually on time for 
                once.    

                                FEMALE VOICE
                Who s this?  

  Keegan realizes it s not Mikki s voice.  

                                KEEGAN
                I m sorry - I was looking for 513.

                                FEMALE VOICE
                This is 513.  

                                KEEGAN
                Is Mikki there?  

                                FEMALE VOICE
                Who s Mikki?  

  Keegan is bewildered.  He pulls out his phone and speed dials 
  someone (presumably Mikki).  No answer.  The line is dead.  Even 
  more bewildered, he presses the buzzer for the penthouse.

                              JULES (O.S.)
                Hello?  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   25.

                Jules, it s Key.  



  Establish City Hall.



  It s a grand house.   The street has been invaded by media.  A 
  cab pulls up and out steps Keegan.  The reporters swarm from 
  every side and surround him.  Keegan comes alive, looking every 
  inch the successful defense attorney.

  Questions are hurled at him ... 

                                KEEGAN
                I have no comment at this stage 
                ladies and gentlemen.  Maybe 
                  something later ... 



  Low angle establisher.

  Keegan s light comes on.  



  Looking like he didn t sleep a wink, Keegan sits on the couch 
  opposite MADDY, 41, very attractive and nurturing.  

                                KEEGAN
                Four years.  Four years together  and 
                she just vanishes without so much as a 
                -  so long.   Like I was just some - 
                      (a beat, hard to say)
                Like I was no different than all the 
                others.

                              MADDY
                Falling in love with a prostitute.  
                You thought you d finally found a 
                  relationship you could control - 
                dictate all the terms - but you 
                  transgressed the established 
                  boundaries and allowed real feelings 
                to develop.

                                KEEGAN
                The established boundaries of 
                  prostitution?

                There are boundaries to every 
                  relationship, Key.  Business.  
                  Marriage.  Whatever.  Most people are 
                aware of them ... 
                      (a beat)
                Are you in love with her?

  A long look between them.  

                              MADDY (CONT D)
                Do you think you might be in love with 
                her?  

  The front door is heard to slam shut.

  FINN, 15, tall and handsome with a fine mop of hair, enters.  
  Keegan sits up to greet him.

                Hey, buddy.

                Nah.  Just catching up.  

  They hug.  

  And now we realize - Maddy is Key s ex-wife, not his shrink.

                              MADDY
                I ve got to run.  You still want that 
                ride?



  Keegan and Mikki walk together.  Her face is stone.

                You re studying law?  I suppose I

                              MIKKI
                It has nothing to do with you.  My 
                father was a lawyer before he joined 
                the State Department.  Look, I have to 
                get back -

                What the hell, Mikki?  I mean - no 
                goodbye?  Maybe a text -  So long, 
                sucker?   Given what we had -

                We had a business relationship.

                                KEEGAN
                No, it started that way, but -  

                              MIKKI
                It started that way and that s how it 
                ended.  I mean - I really can t 
                believe you of all people are this 
                naive.

                                KEEGAN
                Okay, stop.  Can you just be you - be 
                who you are and talk to me.

                              MIKKI
                This is who I am.  Before this - I
                was who you wanted me to be.  Some 
                guys wanted me to be a nurse, a school 
                girl, a dominatrix.  You wanted me to 
                be your friend, so I was.  That was 
                the gig.  You can choose to believe 
                whatever you want.  

                                KEEGAN
                I m not choosing to believe anything.  
                It s an objective fact.  

                              MIKKI
                What is?  

                                KEEGAN
                You and I.  Us.  Our connection was 
                real, Mikki.  You can t just write it 
                off as part of some exit strategy. 
                      (a beat, not easy)
                You can t just cut me out of your 
                life.  Not me.

  She stares at him for a beat.  Has he won her over?  

                              MIKKI
                If we happen to bump into each other 
                in the future, I assume I can rely on 
                your discretion?  

  Keegan reels at the coldness of these words.  

                              MIKKI (CONT D)
                Goodbye, Mr. Keegan.

  Mikki walks away - leaving Keegan utterly lost.  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   45.

  ACT FIVE

  FADE IN:


  I/E.  BEN & SCARLET S -- KITCHEN -- EVENING4343

  Post dinner, Scarlet cleans up while Keegan sits with two of the 
  Leon children, MAX (6) and ZOE (8) (both in pyjamas) climbing 
  all over him.  He tries to summon some enthusiasm for the game 
  but is failing miserably.  

  Ben enters.  

                              BEN
                All right, you little monsters, 
                time for bed.

  The kids protest.  

                              BEN (CONT D)
                Come on.  Say good night.  

  Max and Zoe hug Keegan.  He hugs them back.  

                              MAX & ZOE
                Good night, Key.  

                                KEEGAN
                Night guys.  

                              MAX & ZOE
                Night mom.  

  Scarlet embraces them etc.  

  Keegan and Ben share a look.  

                                KEEGAN
                I should probably go.  

                              BEN
                I ll just be a minute.  Grab 
                yourself another glass.
                      (exiting)
                Come on guys!  Tooth time!

  Ben exits.  Keegan thinks for a moment, picks up his empty 
  wine glass and proceeds into the kitchen where he finds 
  Scarlet tidying.  He fills his wine glass.  





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   47.

                                KEEGAN
                It s probably just me, but have you 
                noticed there s almost no certainty 
                about anything anymore?  

                              SCARLET
                I m not sure ... Oh ... 
                        (indicating a file on a 
                        bench)
                  I printed out our amended witness 
                list for you.  

  Keegan opens the file, reads and sighs.  

                                KEEGAN
                Come on - Red.  Really?  Do we have to 
                endure another blubbering mother 
                  sideshow?  

                              SCARLET
                      (an anticipated victory)
                There are four mothers on the jury, 
                Key.  That gives me four guilty 
                verdicts right there.  I d really 
                think about changing the plea, if I 
                were you.  

  They share a look.  

                              SCARLET (CONT D)
                You don t look good, sweetheart.  As 
                in worse than usual.

                                KEEGAN
                I just bumped into Mikki.  

                              SCARLET
                Oh.  Ben told me she flew the coop.  

                                KEEGAN
                Yeah, she flew, all right.  She s a 
                  veritable phoenix.  Burned down her 
                old life, emerged from the ashes, 
                spread her wings and started anew.  I 
                  should ve asked her how you do that.  
                  Reinvention could really come in handy 
                right about now.      

  Scarlet looks to Keegan and smiles sadly.  Then her face falls 
  and she fights back tears.  She seems on the verge of 
    hyperventilating.  




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   48.

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                Red, you okay?  

  She hurries out of the house into the back garden.  Keegan 
  follows her, catches up with her and stops her.  

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                Red, what is it?!  

                              SCARLET
                He's such - a good man.  He's such a 
                good man.  

                                KEEGAN
                Who?   

                              SCARLET
                Ben.  He s - I don t think I can do it 
                anymore, Key.   

                                KEEGAN
                Do what? 

                              SCARLET
                The Marriage.  The whole - thing.  Our 
                life together.  I don t want it.  I 
                think I don t.   

  Pause.  

                                KEEGAN
                You re kidding me.  Does he know?

                              SCARLET
                Of course not.  I barely know.   

                                KEEGAN
                Okay he did something.  What did he 
                do?  Look, Ben s the sweetest guy in 
                the world, if there s something he s 
                done - 

                              SCARLET
                He didn t do anything!  That s the 
                problem.  

  Then Keegan sees Ben re-enter the kitchen.  

                              BEN
                Hey guys!  

  Scarlet wipes her tears away.  A beat.  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   49.

                                KEEGAN
                We re out here.  



  The reporters come to life as Paul Wilson s family arrives for 
  the trial.  They seem respectable and tight-knit.  The mother 
  and daughter hold hands as they head inside.



  Keegan waits outside the building with Scarlet.

                              SCARLET
                  Blubbering mothers.  

                                KEEGAN
                Get you every time.  You ll bounce 
                back ...You doing okay?

                              SCARLET
                Yeah.  Forget what I said the other 
                night.  I was -  

  But Ben appears.  Keegan cuts her off:

                                KEEGAN
                Hey, buddy.  Well - did I kick some 
                ass in there or what?

                              BEN
                I bow down to you, sir. 

                                KEEGAN
                Where s your mother?  She must be 
                elated.  Give her a call.  Time to 
                party.  

                              BEN
                I m sure she ll make her feelings 
                known the next time you see her.  

                                KEEGAN
                Now as to my bill -   




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                 Goldenrod (04/01/2013)                  57A.

                Can I have it in cash?

                What?

                Help me get around the IRS. 

                              BEN
                Sorry, Key.  They re getting their 
                seventy percent.  Come by the 
                office tomorrow.  

                                KEEGAN
                Yeah.  You guys want to grab some 
                drinks - maybe buy me dinner?

                              SCARLET
                We ve got to run, Key.  

                                KEEGAN
                You um taking the 101?  

                              BEN
                The 10 s probably quicker right 
                now.  

                                KEEGAN
                Of course.  

                              SCARLET
                Have a great night.

                                KEEGAN
                        (glumly)
                I m sure I will.



  Keegan strolls home, feeling down.  He feels a sharp pain in his 
  jaw and rubs it.

                                KEEGAN
                Oh God.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   59.

    CONTINUED:5151

  Then he sees Mikki, waiting on his stoop.  

  Keegan is surprised and confused.

  She looks anxious.  

  A car s headlights find Keegan - and boy, they re getting 
  closer.  Keegan notices but there s not enough time to react.  
  The car mounts the curb and clips him, sending him flying into 
  the trash cans.  

    A silhouetted figure gets out of the car.  

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                  Margaret!
                        (forcing a smile)
                Surely we can sit down and talk 
                about this like adults.  

                                                                        CUT TO:

  Keegan, running for his life - such as it is - pursued by 
    Margaret s headlights.  

  FADE OUT.
