SANNY, an old-time VAUDEVILLIAN, hurriedly fixes a large DROOPY
MOUSTACHE on to a YOUNG WOMAN'S TOP LIP ... this is ANN DARROW.
IMAGES: Weird and wonderful snatches of VAUDEVILLE ACTS follow ...
singers, jugglers, boxing ladies.

Intercut with:
ANGLE ON: ANN on STAGE ... dressed as an ELEGANT GENT, she
launches into `I'm Just Wild About Harry' with HARRY, a larger-
than-life PERFORMER dressed in a FRILLY DRESS, BRASSY RED WIG and
FALSIES.

MANNY's CHARACTER joins in ... SNEEZING LOUDLY and causing ANN to
take a SUDDEN PRAT FALL.
nd so the ROUTINE BUILDS ... ANN and HARRY singing and dancing
... MANNY SNEEZING ... ANN falling.
The AUDIENCE look on with bored expressions on their faces. All
except ONE MAN at the BACK, who is LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.
CLOSE ON: ANN throwing everything into her ACT ... SWEAT rolls
down her face ... she tries not to get distracted by the LAUGHING,
WHEEZING MAN.
WIDER: A SMATTERING of APPLAUSE from the TINY AUDIENCE. 40 PEOPLE
in a THEATRE designed for 500.
Crash cut:
CLOSE ON: MANNY in the NOISY, CROWDED DRESSING ROOM, which is full
of VAUDEVILLE PERFORMERS in various stages of undress.
MANNY fires off a loud comical SNEEZE. He looks around at the
others.
ANNY
That's a funny one! Isn't that
funnier?
HARRY
It's hysterical, Manny. As long as
we're laughing we won't be crying over
the box office. Talk about depressing.
ANGLE ON: ANN sitting down at a MIRROR, starting to take off her
VEST ... a book entitled "ISOLATION" by Jack Driscoll lies half
open on the counter top nearby...
ANN
Twenty girls in feather boas prancing
around like circus ponies! That's
depressing!
ANGLE ON: MAUDE, a BLOWSY SINGER, lighting up a cigarette.
MAUDE
(fondly)
I love a good chorus line!

It's a play.

TAPS
Some guy - Driscoll.

From the Federal Theatre.
AUDE
Don't knock it, honey - at least they
get an audience.
ANN
It'll pick up .... Ain't that right,
Manny?
The DRESSING ROOM goes suddenly quiet ... MANNY looks away,
refusing to meet ANN's eye.
ANN (cont'd)
(trailing off)
It always does.
LICKERING B&W; IMAGES: TIGERS ROARING ... BRUCE BAXTER, in a
PITH HELMET, stalking through undergrowth ... He raises his
rifle and fires! CLICK! The gun is JAMMED. BRUCE turning to
CAMERA, speaking soundlessly.
7.
CLOSE ON: A SLEEPY looking LION. A PIECE of MEAT is lowered
into frame ... DENHAM appears briefly holding the MEAT. He is
attempting to STIR the yawning ANIMAL into life. CAMERA TILTS
UP briefly revealing the bars of a CAGE. PRESTON'S FACE appears
C
above a CLAPPER BOARD ... "TAKE 5"
LOSE ON: CARL DENHAM sitting in the smoky SCREENING ROOM. He
is nervous ... his eyes flick from one INVESTOR to the other ...
trying to read the room.
ZELMAN
How much more is there?
ASSISTANT
Another five reels.
ZELMAN
Lights up.
Light floods the room as the washed out image on screen is
extinguished.
DENHAM notices a sleazy looking INVESTOR wake up with a start.
THUGGISH INVESTOR
This is it? This is what we get for
our forty grand, Denham? Another one
of your Safari pictures?
LEAZY INVESTOR
You promised us romantic scenes with
Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie.
DENHAM
Come on, fellas - you know the deal -
we agreed to push Maureen's start date
so she could get her teeth fixed.
THUGGISH INVESTOR
It's not the principle of the thing -
it's the money.
ELMAN
Carl - you've been in production for
over two months -
DENHAM
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen are gonna
steam up the screen - once we get them
on the ship.
Z
ELMAN
What ship?
DENHAM
The one we've hired to get to the
location.
DENHAM hurriedly pulls himself up - as ZELMAN turns on him.
8.
ZELMAN
What location? Carl - you're supposed
to be shooting on the back-lot.
DENHAM
Yes, I understand that - but fellas,
we're not making that film anymore -
and I'll tell you why.
DENHAM gets out of his SEAT and moves to the FRONT of the ROOM.
DENHAM (cont'd)
The story has changed, the script has
been rewritten.
DENHAM turns to face the room, whipping a TATTERED MAP out of his
pocket.
DENHAM (cont'd)
Life intervened! I've come into
possession of a map.
growing excitement)
The soul surviving record of an
unchartered island, a place that was
thought to exist only in myth ...
until now!
ZELMAN
Whoa! Carl - slow down!
SLEAZY INVESTOR
Is he askin' for more money?
THUGISH INVESTOR
He's asking us to fund a wild goose-
chase.
DENHAM
I'm talking about a primitive world
... never before seen by man! The
ruins of an entire civilisation - the
most spectacular thing you've ever
seen!
(dramatiC pause)
That's where I'll shoot my picture!
SILENCE for a beat ... And then -
SLEAZY INVESTOR
Will there be boobies?
DENHAM is momentarily SPEECHLESS.
DENHAM
Excuse me, boobies?
9.
SLEAZY INVESTOR
Jigglies, jablongers, bazoomers! ...
In my experience people only go to
these films to observe the ...
undraped form of the native girls.
DENHAM
What are you - an idiot? You think
they asked De Mille to waste his time
on nudie shots? No - they respected
the film maker, they showed some
class! Not that you'd know what that
means - you cheap low-life!
ZELMAN shifts uncomfortably in his seat as THUGGISH shoots him an
ANGRY LOOK.
ZELMAN
Would you step outside for a moment,
Carl?
DENHAM looks at them ... the INVESTORS avoid EYE CONTACT.
AS DENHAM STEPS INTO THE LOBBY, PRESTON, HIS LONG SUFFERING
ASSISTANT WAITS ON A SOFA.
DENHAM points suddenly to the GLASS OF WATER on the TABLE next to
PRESTON.
DENHAM
Gimme that - quick!
PRESTON hands him the WATER.
PRESTON
You won't like it, it's non-alcoholic!
DENHAM empties the GLASS into a POT PLANT.
DENHAM
Preston, you have a lot to learn about
the motion picture business.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM quietly places the GLASS against the SCREENING
ROOM DOOR, and presses his ear against it.
ZELMAN looks to the INVESTORS.
ZELMAN
Don't write him off fellas. He's hot-
headed sure, but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures, he's had a
lot of ... near success.
10.
THUGGISH INVESTOR
(interrupts)
He's a preening self promoter ...
CLOSE ON: DENHAM listening ...
THUGGISH INVESTOR (O.S.)
(through the door)
... an ambitious no-talent! The guy
has "loser" written all over him.
ELMAN (O.S.)
Look, I understand your
disappointment.
HUGISH INVESTOR (O.S.)
He's washed up - It's all over town!
SLEAZY INVESTOR (O.S.)
He can't direct. He doesn't have the
smarts.
THUGGISH INVESTOR
This jumped up little turd's gonna
bankrupt us.
ZELMAN
The animal footage has value?
SLEAZY INVESTOR
Sure ... Universal are desperate for
stock footage.
THUGGISH INVESTOR
Then sell it! Scrap the picture! We
gotta retrieve something from this
debacle.
Z
ELMAN nods ... gestures to the YOUNG ASSISTANT.
ZELMAN
Get him back in.
ANGLE ON: The YOUNG ASSISTANT opens the DOOR, steps into the LOBBY
which is ...
YOUNG ASSISTANT
Mr. Denham?
... EMPTY.
11.
ANGLE ON: PRESTON and DENHAM sit on the BACK SEAT. PRESTON is
feverishly scribbling on his NOTEPAD.
DENHAM
You got it ... and tell Maureen - she
doesn't have six hours to put on her
face. If she wants to be in this
picture, she's gotta be on that boat!
PRESTON
She doesn't want to be in this
picture.
DENHAM looks at him blankly.
P
RESTON (cont'd)
Maureen pulled out.
DENHAM
She pulled out?!
RESTON
Yesterday. I told you.
13.
DENHAM
(suspicious thought)
You said we were shooting in
Singapore, right? That's what you told
her?
PRESTON
But we're not shooting in Singapore.
DENHAM
exasperation)
Goddammit, Preston! All you had to do
is look her in the eye and lie.
DENHAM turns away, his brain whirring ... thinking hard ...
DENHAM (cont'd)
I gotta get to a phone ... talk to
Harlow's people.
PRESTON
he`s unavailable.
HIGH WIDE: DENHAM'S CAB wends it's way through BUSY NEW YORK
streets ...
DENHAM (O.S.)
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?
PRESTON
Mae West?! No! She has to be a size
four!
ANGLE ON: PRESTON and DENHAM sit on the BACK SEAT.
PRESTON
ou gotta get a girl who'll fit
Maureen's costumes.
DENHAM
(sudden inspiration)
Fay's a size four!
PRESTON
es she is, but she is doing a picture
with RKO.
DENHAM looks away, muttering to himself ...
DENHAM
ooper huh?
(darkly)
I might have known.
14.
ANGLE ON: ANN is eating from a FULL PLATE, trying to disguise her
HUNGER. DENHAM walks over carrying a CUP of COFFEE.
DENHAM
Vaudeville huh? I worked Vaudeville
once... that is a tough audience. If
you don't kill them fast, they kill
you.
ANN
Mr. Denham - I want you to know that
I'm not in the habit of accepting
charity from strangers, or for that
matter ... taking things that don't
belong to me.
D
DENHAM
t was obviously a terrible
misunderstanding.
ANN
It's just that, I haven't been paid in
a while ...
16.
DENHAM
mock sincerity)
That's awful. Anyway, Ann - may I call
you Ann?
DENHAM leans forward ... lowering his voice.
DENHAM (cont'd)
... You wouldn't happen to be a size
four by any chance?
ANN pauses mid way through a mouthful of food, her appetite
suddenly draining away. She abruptly stands.
DENHAM (cont'd)
No! Oh God, no! You've got me all
wrong. Miss Darrow, please! I'm not
that type of person at all!
ANN
What type of person are you?
DENHAM
I'm someone you can trust, Ann. I'm a
movie producer.
(sincere)
Believe me, I am on the level, no
funny business. Please, sit down -
Please ... Please.
ANN hesitates a moment before sitting down once again.
DENHAM (cont'd)
(pitching the film)
Ann, I want you to imagine a handsome
explorer bound for the Far East.
ANN
You're filming in the Far East?
ANGLE ON: DENHAM looking her in the eye and lying.
DENHAM
Singapore. On board ship he meets a
mysterious girl. She's beautiful ...
she's fragile ... haunted ...
ANN looks up ... caught by the tale DENHAM is weaving.
DENHAM (cont'd)
She can't escape the feeling that
forces beyond her control are
compelling her down a road from which
she cannot draw back. It's as if her
whole life has been a prelude to this
moment - this fateful meeting that
changes everything. And sure enough,
against her better judgement -
17.
ANN
She falls in love.
DENHAM
Yes!
ANN
But she doesn't trust it. She's not
even sure if she believes in love.
DENHAM
Oh really?
ANN
If she loves someone - it's doomed.
DENHAM
Why is that?
ANN
Good things never last, Mr. Denham.
An awkward pause ... ANN looks away, having revealed too much.
DENHAM considers her a beat, realising something ...
DENHAM
So you're interested?
ANGLE ON: DENHAM hurriedly gathering up his hat and coat.
DENHAM (cont'd)
That's settled then. I don't want to
rush you - but we are under some time
pressure here.
ANN
Well I really -
DENHAM
Ann? I'm telling you, You're perfect -
look at you! You're the saddest girl I
ever met ... you're gonna make `em
weep, Ann - you're gonna break their
hearts!
ANN
See, that's where you're wrong, Mr.
Denham, I make people laugh, that's
what I do.
ANN suddenly STANDS.
ANN (cont'd)
Good luck with your picture.
DENHAM follows ANN to the DOOR ...
DENHAM
(growing desperation)
Ann! Miss Darrow! Please!
18.
I'm offering NHAM(cont'd)
DE you money, adventure,
fame ... the thrill of a lifetime and
a long sea voyage. You wanna read a
script? Jack Driscoll's turning in a
draft as we speak.
ANN stops and turns. A
ANN
Jack Driscoll?
DENHAM
ure. Why - wait! You know him?
ANN
Well, no - not personally. I've seen
his plays.
DENHAM, sensing her interest, starts to get excited.
DENHAM
What a writer, huh? And let me tell
you Ann, Jack Driscoll doesn't want
just anyone starring in this picture.
He said to me, "Carl, somewhere out
there is a woman born to play this
role ..."
(quiet realization)
And as soon as I saw you, I knew -
ANN
(uneasy)
Knew what?
DENHAM
It was always going to be you.
SLOW PUSH IN on ANN as she realises she is standing on the brink
of a life changing moment.
BEEFY SAILORS shovel COAL into the SHIP'S FURNACE ... another
cranks a valve on the pistons.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM enters his CABIN looking FLUSTERED. He is
STARTLED to find JACK DRISCOLL waiting for him. DRISCOLL is a
WRITER, well dressed in a SHABBY sort of way.
DENHAM
Jesus, Jack - you scared me!
DENHAM crosses to a cabinet and breaks into a CRATE OF JOHNNY
WALKER.
DENHAM (cont'd)
Listen, if anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me ...
say I got depressed and committed
suicide. Say I stuck my head down a
toilet!
holding up a bottle)
You want one?
22.
JACK
No! I can't stay, Carl. I have a
rehearsal for which I am now ...
checks WATCH)
... three hours late.
JACK throws a FEW SCRIPT PAGES across the TABLE.
DENHAM
What's this?
JACK
It's the script.
DENHAM
This is a script? Jack ... this is
fifteen pages.
ACK
I know - but they're good! You've got
fifteen good pages there, Carl!
DENHAM
I'm supposed to be making a feature
length picture.
JACK
You told me I had more time. I'm
sorry. Look I gotta go.
DENHAM
Jack - No - you can't do this to me! I
have a beginning but I need a middle
and an end! I gotta have something to
shoot.
The SHIP'S ENGINES roar into life ... JACK stands to leave.
JACK
You got my notes - I gotta go. See
you.
CLOSE ON: DENHAM looking DISMAYED. He stares blankly at the RUSH
of ACTIVITY through the PORTHOLE WINDOW behind JACK.
OV: The VENTURE'S CREW hurriedly RELEASE ROPES in preparation for
the ship's imminent departure.
DENHAM'S expression slowly CHANGES ...
DENHAM
Alright, fine. We might as well settle
up.
JACK looks ASTONISHED as DENHAM pulls out his CHEQUE BOOK.
JACK
You're going to pay me?
23.
DENHAM
I'm not going to stiff a friend.
ACK
I've never known you to volunteer cash
before ...
DENHAM
How does two grand sound?
JACK
Sounds great!
DENHAM
Thought it might.
DENHAM'S eyes flick to the WINDOW ... sees SAILORS are hauling up
the GANGPLANK.
NGLE ON: A SAILOR CRANKS a series of VALVES as the SHIP'S PISTONS
crank in to life.
DENHAM signs the CHEQUE, and hands it over with a FLOURISH ...
D
DENHAM (cont'd)
(signing with a flourish)
Voila!
JACK snatches the CHEQUE and turns to leave.
JACK
Thanks...
JACK glances at it.
JACK (cont'd)
Carl ... you've written "Two Grand".
DENHAM takes the CHEQUE back ...
DENHAM
So I did ... Sorry about that
(screwing it up)
Let's start from the beginning.
DENHAM (cont'd)
(writing)
"Two Thousand Dollars" ...
ANGLE ON: The ship's PISTONS PUMP faster.
DENHAM looks up at JACK, a confused look on his face.
DENHAM (cont'd)
It is the 29th, isn't it?
JACK
(anxious)
Come on - it's the 25th, Carl, the
25th!
24.
ANGLE ON: JACK suddenly realises the SHIP is about to leave.
DENHAM
I'm sorry. Let me just ... It'll just
take a second.
DENHAM screws up the CHEQUE again! The VIBRATION of the ENGINES
picks up. JACK heads for the DOOR!
JACK
Never mind, pay me when you get back!
DENHAM
(knowing)
Alright ... okay ...
CLOSE ON: THE SHIPS GAUGES SPRING INTO ACTION.
NGLE ON: BRUCE BAXTER walking along the CORRIDOR, with PRESTON
following behind laden with LUGGAGE. BRUCE is in his early
thirties ... He is QUICK WITTED, SOPHISTICATED and CHARMING...
but his career as a SCREEN ACTOR has badly stalled.
PRESTON
Your cabin's just down here,
Mr. Baxter. May I say how excited we
are to have you back with us, Sir.
ANGLE ON: JACK is hurrying down the corridor towards the DOOR. He
feels the SHIP MOVING! He suddenly collides with BRUCE, who
thrusts a SUITCASE at him.
BRUCE
Be a sport and lend us a hand.
JACK
Oh, Christ!
JACK looks desperately out of the PORTHOLE, doubles back and BOLTS
AWAY.
BRUCE
(dryly)
Appreciate the help, fella.
PRESTON
Let me get the door for you - welcome
to your state room sir.
25.
ANGLE ON: BRUCE is clearly unimpressed with the TINY CABIN. He
reacts to the SMELL.
RESTON
know, that's not a nice smell is it?
I'm sure it'll disperse in a day or
two. Did I ever mention how much I
love your work, Mr. Baxter? I've seen
every one of your pictures ... even
the silent ones.
RUCE
I haven't made any silent ones.
BRUCE gently closes the DOOR in PRESTON'S FACE - leaving him
silently CURSING to himself in the CORRIDOR.
CLOSE ON: ANN tests her mattress with her hands. ANN straightens &
turns, perching on the edge of the BUNK.
27.
PRESTON
(apologetic)
I hope you find it to your liking...
it's quite comfortable. Your towels
and linens are underneath the bed.
That is the wash basin. I know, that's
not a pleasant smell - is it? I'm sure
it'll disperse in a day or two.
RESTON dances over to the WARDROBE.
PRESTON (cont'd)
The closet ... your costumes - I hope
you'll find everything is in order. If
there is anything that you need,
please do not hesitate to ask...fresh
water, perhaps? I can bring it to you
personally.
PRESTON is interrupted by a knock on the CABIN DOOR...
ANGLE ON: The DOOR opens and DENHAM enters. He thrusts a bottle of
JOHNNY WALKER SCOTCH into ANN'S HANDS ...
DENHAM
Knock knock! We can't have our leading
lady deprived of the necessities of
life.
to PRESTON)
Do me a favour - run a bottle down to
Jack. It'll fend off his migraine.
PRESTON
They're still trying to find a place
for him to sleep.
DENHAM
(to PRESTON)
You told him my typewriter is
available for hire?
RESTON
Yes - he didn't take it well.
PRESTON departs down the corridor.
ANN
(confused)
Mr. Driscoll ...?
DENHAM turns and looks at ANN.
ANN (cont'd)
He's on board?
DENHAM
Jack has his heart set on coming. Call
me a softie - I couldn't say no.
28.
ANGLE ON: CHOY is showing JACK to his sleeping QUARTERS, carrying
BLANKETS.
JACK stares in DISBELIEF at the DINGY HOLD strewn with STRAW
BALES and EMPTY ANIMAL CAGES. He reacts to the SMELL.
CHOY
This room very comfortable, plenty dim
light ... fresh straw.
JACK
What'd you keep down here?
CHOY
Lion, tiger, hippo - you name it.
Jack
What, do you sell them to Zoos?
CHOY
Zoos ... circus ...
(lowers voice)
Skipper get big money for rare animal.
(alarmed)
Careful! Camel have bad accident on
floor. Stain unremovable ...
JACK looks down. He's standing in a dark, viscous PUDDLE OF GUNGE.
CHOY (cont'd)
(lowers voice)
Skipper catch any animal you want. He
do you real good price on rhite wino.
E
ENGLEHORN
(sternly)
Choy!
ANGLE ON: CHOY clams up as ENGLEHORN strolls into the hold.
ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
My apologies for not being able to
offer you a cabin. Have you found an
enclosure to your taste?
JACK
(dryly)
Spoilt for choice.
ENGLEHORN surveys a COUPLE OF LARGE CAGES.
ENGLEHORN
What are you, Mr. Driscoll, a lion or
a chimpanzee?
JACK opens a CAGE large enough to sleep in.
29.
JACK
Maybe, I'll take this one.
He steps back with SURPRISE as a WOODEN CRATE TOPPLES, spilling
out a LARGE MEDICAL BOTTLE. CHOY looks up in SHOCK as the BOTTLE
ROLLS towards ENGLEHORN who coolly TRAPS it with his FOOT.
E
ENGLEHORN
I told you to lock it up.
CHOY
(scared)
Sorry, Skipper! Lumpy said -
ENGLEHORN
(interrupts)
Lumpy doesn't give the orders. What
are you trying to do? Put the whole
ship to sleep? Get them out of here!
ENGLEHORN hands the BOTTLE to a nervous CHOY. JACK stares at the
CRATES stacked in the CAGE.
CLOSE ON: Piles of BOTTLES, all marked "Chloroform".
NGLE ON: BRUCE pins movie posters from some of his previous films
on his cabin wall ... He steps back, admiring them.
ANGLE ON: JACK, sitting in the hold, TAPPING on an OLD TYPEWRITER
propped up on BOXES. He is clearly very QUEASY, as he tries to
stay focussed on the TYPEWRITER KEYS.
He sees JIMMY carrying a TRAY come into view, he COUGHS and CLAMS
UP.
JIMMY
Compliments of the chef -
ANGLE ON: JIMMY unloading the BOWLS of GREY looking STEW from the
TRAY.
LOSE ON: JIMMY puts the BOWL next to JACK ... who takes one look
at it, and SQUEEZES his eyes closed.
JACK (O.S.)
Oh Christ - oh God!
JIMMY
Lambs brains in walnut sauce.
30.
The CAGES and ROPES SWAY with each roll of the WAVES ... JIMMY
walks away.
ANGLE ON: JACK looking very nauseated ...
HAYES (O.S.)
Jimmy!
JIMMY spins round, a guilty look on his face.
HAYES (cont'd)
You run those ropes up on deck like I
told you?
JIMMY
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.
ANGLE ON: JIMMY tries to slip past, but HAYES grabs his WRIST.
HAYES
How about you return Mr. Driscoll's
pen first?
CLOSE ON: An expensive FOUNTAIN PEN drops from JIMMY'S HAND and
clatters to the floor. QUICK as an eel, JIMMY scampers AWAY.
HAYES shakes his head, and picks up the PEN ... hands it back.
HAYES (cont'd)
He doesn't mean any harm. I'll keep
him out of Jyour way.
ACK
No, it's okay.
HAYES
It's just he likes it down here, it's
where I found him ... four years ago
... stowed away in one of them cages.
His arm was broken in two places, he
was wilder than half the animals in
here. Still won't tell me where he
came from - all I know, it wasn't any
place good.
ANN is holding a copy of JACK'S PLAY "ISOLATION" ... she is
standing in front of a mirror rehearsing her introduction.
ANN
It's nice to meet you Mr. Driscoll -
I'm actually quite familiar with your
work.
(trying again)
Oh yes! ... Hello, Mr Driscoll - it's
so nice to meet you! Actually, I'm
quite familiar with your work. I'm a
huge fan!
(one more time)
I've read everything you've ever
written.
ANN'S face falls in DESPAIR - she can't get rid of her nerves
about meeting the famous JACK DRISCOLL.
32.
A few sailors are finishing BREAKFAST.
PRESTON, HERB and MIKE are seated at a TABLE.
ANGLE ON: MIKE packing away his HEADPHONES and SOUND RECORDING
EQUIPMENT.
M
IKE
I'm gonna have the ships' engines all
over the dialogue - sea gulls, camera
noise, wind and Christ knows what
else!
DENHAM
I don't care, Mike! You're the sound
recordist - make it work.
ANGLE ON: ANN in the CHIFFON DRESS, hesitating in the doorway of
the MESS.
DENHAM looks up and signals her over.
DENHAM (cont'd)
Ann! Come on in! Let me introduce you
to the crew! This is Herb - our
cameraman ...
ANN reaches out to shake HERB'S hand.
HERB
Delighted to meet you, ma'am. And may
I say what a lovely dress.
ANN
Oh! This old thing! I just - threw it
on!
PRESTON
(confused to DENHAM)
Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes?
ANN
(hurriedly)
What does a girl have to do round here
to get some breakfast!
DENHAM
Lumpy! You heard the lady!
ANGLE ON: LUMPY looking up. He is simultaneously shaving a
SAILOR and stirring PORRIDGE.
LUMPY
Fancy some of me ... ah ... Porridge
aux walnuts?
33.
DENHAM turns back to ANN, who is staring at MIKE, who has his
head down, scribbling in a NOTEBOOK.
DENHAM
ANN, I don't believe you've met -
ANN
That's alright Mr. Denham, I know who
this is ...
ANGLE ON: ANN, who is staring at MIKE in quiet awe. He glances up
at her, nervously.
ANN (cont'd)
Thrilled to meet you. It's an honour -
to be part of this.
MIKE
(bewildered)
Gee, thanks!
ANN
Actually - I am quite familiar with
your work.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM raises a quizzical EYEBROW.
MIKE
Really?
ANN
Yes, and what I most admire - is the
way you have captured the voice of the
common people.
MIKE
Well - that's my job.
ANN
I'm sure you've heard this before, Mr
Driscoll, if you don't mind me saying -
you don't look at all like your
photograph ...
A
NGLE ON: JACK at the bar, holding a cup of COFFEE. He turns
and glances at ANN.
MIKE
Excuse me?
DENHAM
Wait a minute! Ann -
ANN
(to DENHAM)
Well, he's so much younger - in
person.
(turning back to MIKE)
And much better looking.
34.
JACK starts to walk over to the table.
DENHAM
ANN! Stop! Stop - right there -
ANGLE ON: MIKE staring past ANN'S shoulder.
ANN
I was afraid you might be one of those
self obsessed literary types. You know
- the tweedy twerp with his nose in a
book and his head up his -
JACK snaps his BOOK closed. ANN turns around ... her face drops.
JACK looks at ANN, who stares at him MORTIFIED.
JACK
It's nice to meet you too, Miss
Darrow..
RUCE bumps into JIMMY who hurries away looking shifty.
BRUCE enters his CABIN ... A moustache has been drawn on all his
POSTERS. BRUCE looks annoyed ... then takes another look.
CLOSE ON: BRUCE glancing in the mirror - imaging himself with a
moustache. Not bad.
ANGLE ON: JACK, sitting in the hold, TAPPING on an OLD TYPEWRITER
propped up on BOXES. He is clearly very QUEASY, as he tries to
stay focussed on the TYPEWRITER KEYS.
DENHAM is pacing the HOLD, sucking on a PIPE.
DENHAM

First Mate?
35.
JACK
That's assuming she knows who the
First Mate is.
DENHAM
Come on, Jack! It was an honest
mistake. Ann is near-sighted - it
could happen to anyone.
JACK
I was joking, Carl.
DENHAM
The point is: she's horrified. She has
to look away. And that's when she sees
it.
JACK
See's what? What?
ANGLE ON: Unseen by either DENHAM or JACK, JIMMY has snuck down in
to the HOLD ...
DENHAM
(dramatic)
The island.
JACK
(taken aback)
We're filming on an island now? When
did this happen?
DENHAM
Jack, keep your voice down! I don't
want the crew getting spooked.
JACK
Why would they get spooked? What's it
called?
DENHAM looks SHIFTY.
DENHAM
All right ... It has a local name, but
I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't
sound good.
ANGLE ON: JIMMY, his attention caught as he eavesdrops on the
conversation.
JACK looks at DENHAM in GROWING FRUSTRATION.
DENHAM (cont'd)
(quietly)
They call it ...
(muffled)
JIMMY POV: DENHAM leaning in and murmuring to JACK.
36.
JACK
What's wrong with this place?
DENHAM
There's nothing officially wrong with
it. Because technically it hasn't been
discovered yet.
JACK gives up, feeling too seasick to argue ...
JACK
(resuming typing)
Okay ... alright ... so we arrive at
(
this place ...
typing)
S ... k ... u ...
CLOSE ON: DENHAM looks up in time to see JIMMY listening ... Their
eyes meet ... DENHAM tries to hush JACK - too late.
JACK (cont'd)
l ... l ... Island.
ANN is making her way to the BATHROOM. She looks up as JACK
rounds a corner coming the other way. They walk toward each
other.
SUDDENLY the ship sways, JACK is thrown forward, but ANN
manages to hold her BALANCE.
JACK
Good legs.
ANN looks at him SHARPLY.
JACK (cont'd)
Sea legs - I meant - you know ... sea
legs. Not that you don't have good
legs, I was just ...
JACK trails off as ANN edges past him, averting her eyes.
JACK (cont'd)
... making conversation. Jesus!
(calling)
Miss Darrow!
ANN stops and turns ...
JACK (cont'd)
About the scene - today, with you and
Bruce -
ANN
I know, it wasn't what you wrote. But
Mr Baxter felt very strongly that when
a man likes a woman - then he must
ignore her. And if things turn really
hostile ... no?
JACK
Interesting theory.
ANN
I know ... I should have -
JACK
It wasn't what I had intended ... but
it -
ANN
I'm sorry - I was ...
39.
JACK
You made it your own ...
ANN
I was nervous.
JACK
It was funny, actually ... you were
funny.
ANN
Please - don't say another word. Good
night.
ANN goes to close her CABIN DOOR.
ACK
Miss Darrow ...
ANN looks at him.
JACK (cont'd)
You don't have to be nervous.
CLOSE ON: ENGLEHORN'S POV of SHIPPING CHARTS.
DENHAM
We're close. Head south-west.
40.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN leaning over SHIPPING CHARTS. DENHAM hovers
nearby in the doorway.
ENGLEHORN
There's no land south-west for
thousands of miles. It takes us way
outside the shipping lanes.
ENGLEHORN turns and confronts DENHAM.
ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
I won't sail blind in these waters.
DENHAM
'll make it worth your while.
NGLE ON: ENGLEHORN ... tempted by the offer of more money, but
his instincts are telling him to not to agree.
ENGLEHORN
There's nothing out there.
DENHAM
hen you've nothing to lose.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN: conflicted.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM & PRESTON are seated at a table, talking quietly.
ANGLE ON: HAYES enters the MESS ... HAYES saunters over to PRESTON
& DENHAM.
HAYES
If someone were to tell you this ship
is headed for Singapore, what would
you say?
41.
ANGLE ON: LUMPY is standing quietly honing a knife with a whet-
stone ... it makes a L
sharp sound ...
LUMPY
I would say they was full of it, Mr.
Hayes. We turned south-west last
night.
LOSE ON: DENHAM looks up sharply ... HAYES is standing over him.
DENHAM
Gentlemen please, we're not looking
for trouble -
ANGLE ON: JIMMY enters the MESS from behind him...
JIMMY
No. You're looking for something else
...
PRESTON glances warily at DENHAM. DENHAM takes in the situation
and decides to front up.
DENHAM
(quietly)
Yes .... we are. We're gonna find
Skull Island! We're gonna find it,
film it and show it to the world. For
twenty five cents you get to see the
last blank space on the map!
LUMPY
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
PRESTON
What do you mean?
LUMPY
Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes - we
were working our passage on a
Norwegian barque.
HAYES
We picked up a castaway - found him in
the water - he'd been drifting for
days.
LUMPY
His ship had run aground on an island,
way West of Sumatra. An island hidden
in fog. He spoke of a huge wall, built
so long ago - no one knew who had made
it ... A wall a hundred foot high ...
as strong today as it was, ages ago.
PRESTON
Why did they build the wall?
SILENCE ...
42.
LUMPY
The castaway - he spoke of a creature,
neither beast nor man, but something
monstrous, living behind that wall...
DENHAM
A lion or a tiger. A man-eater. That's
how all these stories start.
PRESTON
(to LUMPY)
What else did he say?
LUMPY
Nothing. We found him the next morning
... he'd stuck a knife through his
heart.
NGLE ON: PRESTON looking ASHEN ... DENHAM breaks the GRIM MOOD.
DENHAM
orry fellas, you'll have to do better
than that. Monsters belong in B
movies!
NGLE ON: PRESTON & DENHAM making a rapid exit.
HAYES
If you find this place -
DENHAM and PRESTON stop and turn back ...
HAYES (cont'd)
If you go ashore with your friends and
your cameras ... you won't come back
... Just so long as you understand
that.
The ENGINEERS shovel more COAL into the FURNACE ... The relentless
rhythm of the SHIPS PISTON'S PUMPING UP and DOWN continues ...
PRESTON LYING AWAKE FREAKING OUT intercut with close ups of THE
MAP WITH THE WORDS `FOG'.
WIDE ON: THE STERN of the VENTURE cuts through the swell then
AERIAL up over the top of the boat.
t is late at night. JACK sits on his make shift bed, his
typewriter balanced on his lap ... intent on what he is writing.
43.
NGLE ON: JACK continues typing.
HAYES is manning the WHEEL. ENGLEHORN is staring at the CHARTS, a
CIGARETTE in his hand. There is a PALPABLE sense of tension in
the AIR.
HAYES
(tense)
How long do you expect us to stay out
here?
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN puts his cigarette out, ignoring HAYES.
ANN is pacing the cabin. She is wearing a SHAWL over pyjamas. She
smiles as she turns pages of a loose leaf manuscript. ANN looks up
at JACK.
ANN
(surprised)
You're writing a stage comedy?
JACK
I'm writing it for you.
ANN looks at him, taken aback.
ANN
Why would you do that?
JACK
Why would I write a play for you?
ANN
Yes.
44.
JACK
Isn't it obvious?
ANN
Not to me.
JACK
Well, it's in the sub-text.
ANN
I guess I must've missed it.
JACK
It's not about words ...
ANN looks at him uncertainly ... as JACK moves towards her ...
He takes her in his arms and kisses her.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: THE RADIO OPERATOR receiving MESSAGE.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: JACK and ANN still KISSING.
CUT TO:

RADIO OPERATOR
Message for you, Captain.
HAYES manning the WHEEL, looks at DENHAM briefly ...
DENHAM
Hayes! Why are we turning around?
LOSE ON: ENGLEHORN enters the CABIN ...
DENHAM (cont'd)
(blustering)
Englehorn, you can't just ...
ENGLEHORN
(curt)
Outside!
CLOSE ON: HAYES at the WHEEL, looking down at the SHIP'S
COMPASS ... it is swinging wildly to and fro.
HAYES
(calling)
Captain ...
CLOSE ON: ENGLEHORN looks at the compass with CONCERN. He takes
the wheel from HAYES.
ENGLEHORN
Check our position. Use the stars.
ANGLE ON: HAYES steps outside the WHEELHOUSE, carrying a
SEXTANT. ... he looks up at the SKY and his face hardens with
concern.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN looks across as HAYES appears at the
WHEELHOUSE DOOR.
HAYES
(ominous)
There are no stars, Captain.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN at the WHEEL ... he barks at the HELMSMAN.
ENGLEHORN
Station the for'head lookout, and get
me the depth by lead-line!
48.
HELMSMAN
Aye, Captain.
The HELMSMAN hurries away.
HAYES is tense. ENGLEHORN remains focussed, his eyes fixed ahead.
ENGLEHORN
Reduce speed, steerage way only.
HAYES swings the TELEGRAPH LEVERS.
HAYES
Dead slow ahead, both.
(beat)
You should stop the ship.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN spins the WHEEL.
ENGLEHORN
15 degrees Port.
(beat)
We're getting out of here, Mr. Hayes
... we'll find clear conditions.
CREWMAN (O.S.)
(calling)
We have seabed!
CLOSE ON: HAYES rushes out of the WHEELHOUSE.
ANGLE ON: HAYES rushes to the WHEELHOUSE DOOR.
49.
HAYES
We're shallowing!
ENGLEHORN looks with despair at the THICKENING FOG ahead. He
starts spinning the WHEEL.
ENGLEHORN
20 degrees starboard!
HAYES
(urgent)
Captain, you don't know where the hell
you're going!
ENGLEHORN glares at HAYES.
ENGLEHORN
Get me another reading!
HAYES leaves ...
HAYES
(yelling)
Another reading!
ENGLEHORN peers uneasily out at the FOG ...
ENGLEHORN
Douse the lights!
HELMSMAN
Aye, aye Captain ...
ENGLEHORN stares at the LOOMING WALL, unable to believe his
eyes ... he starts SPINNING the WHEEL hard to STARBOARD!
ENGLEHORN
Stop engines!
ANGLE ON: HAYES slams the TELEGRAPH to "STOP"
ENGLEHORN searches desperately through the thick FOG.
CLOSE ON: ENGLEHORN yells at HAYES.
ENGLEHORN
Give me some power! Half astern, both!
HAYES
Half astern, both, Captain!
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN lets go of the WHEEL rushing towards the
WHEELHOUSE DOOR.
ENGLEHORN
Take the wheel, Hayes!
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN rushes on to the DECK and looks with HORROR as
he realises his SHIP is trapped amid a LABYRINTH of ROCKS.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN staggers into the WHEELHOUSE, slamming the
TELEGRAPH LEVER forward.
ENGLEHORN
Full ahead!
ENGLEHORN takes the WHEEL from HAYES.
CLOSE ON: JETS of WATER are squirting into the ENGINE ROOM,
through cracks between RIVETED PLATES.
HAYES supervises STOKERS frantically opening valves on the
PUMPS. OLD MATTRESSES are being shoved up against the LEAKS.
ENGLEHORN arrives, looking GRIM.
ENGLEHORN
Hayes!
HAYES
he's taken a pounding ...
ENGLEHORN
What about the prop?
HAYES
Shaft's not bent, far as we can tell,
but she's stuck hard against the rock -
A LOUD GROAN as the SHIP shifts against the ROCKS.
At that moment JIMMY comes bursting into the ENGINE ROOM.
JIMMY
Captain! You'd better come up quick!
IDE ON: DENHAM leads HERB, PRESTON, JACK, ANN, BRUCE, MIKE
and
the TWO SAILORS up a DARK, VAULTED TUNNEL. They look in silence at
the primitive signs of civilisation.
ANGLE ON: ANN looks up the STAIRCASE nervously ... taking in the
sight of the HUMAN SKULLS lining the walls.
55.
DENHAM leads the GROUP across a RICKETY BAMBOO BRIDGE, spanning a
section of BROKEN PATH. They pass BROKEN TOMBS, burial niches
containing glimpses of MUMMIES.
AHEAD ... DAYLIGHT streams in as they near the end of the
STAIRCASE. They make their way over large stone blocks, caved
in from above ... QUIET, TENSE.
FOLLOW ...
56.
HAYES V/O
We are accustomed to look upon the
shackled form of a conquered monster,
but there, there you could look at a
thing monstrous and free."
CRANE UP: to reveal a PLATEAU below them, covered with the RUINS
of an ANCIENT BURIAL GROUND ... stone MAUSOLEUMS and TOMBS,
smashed open and destroyed.
DENHAM'S CABIN - NIGHT
DENHAM is swigging from a HIP FLASK. HERB and PRESTON are gathered
gloomily around a TABLE, while DENHAM strides around the ROOM,
swigging and talking in a animated fashion. The STORM BATTERS and
CRASHES outside.
DENHAM
We got away. We gotta be grateful for
that gentlemen.
PRESTON
What about Mike? He didn't get away -
he's still there!
DENHAM
(sharply)
Mike died doing what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing. And I'll
tell you something else - I'm going to
finish this film - for Mike.
60.
I'm going to NHAM(cont'd) donate the
DE finish it and
proceeds to his wife and kids -
because that man is a hero and he
deserves nothing less!
HERB
Hear! Hear!
ANN alone in her CABIN, is overwhelmed by a terrible SENSE of
FOREBODING ...
SUDDENLY! A WAVE crashes against her WINDOW! SHE SPINS AROUND
IN FRIGHT.
As she turns slowly she catches sight of her terrified reflection
in the MIRROR.
A growing sense of UNEASE fills ANN with DREAD.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: JACK sprawled on a BENCH SEAT in the MESS ... a LOUD
METALLIC CREAK wakes him up. He rolls over, tries to focus ...
he touches his hand to the back of his HEAD ... when he
withdraws his hand ... his fingers are covered in BLOOD.
SUDDENLY LUMPY and a SAILOR pick the TABLE up from under him and
carry it outside.
CUT TO:
61.
CLOSE ON: ANN, a sense of foreboding...
ANN alone in her CABIN. She looks down and notices her HANDS are
TREMBLING.
UDDENLY! Her CABIN door starts to rattle. She swings around in
FRIGHT, to see cabin's DOOR HANDLE - which is turning ...
ANGLE ON: ANN'S FACE as her CABIN DOOR opens ...

panicked CORRIDOR, trying to get to ANN'S CABIN ...

He lands on the floor ...

SHOCKED to find it EMPTY with clear signs of a STRUGGLE.
62.
ANGLE ON: HAYES desperately trying to control the WHEEL.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN shouts the command ...
ENGLEHORN
Wheel amidship ... Full ahead, both
engines.
JACK bursts into the CABIN. CLOTHES are SCATTERED EVERYWHERE.
clearly a sign of a struggle.
JACK
Ann!
NGLE ON: JACK races down the CORRIDOR finding a DEAD CREW
MEMBER lying below the STAIRS!
HAYES V/O
... report to stations! Jump to it!
ENGLEHORN LIFTS UP THE WINDOW SEAT ... revealing a ROW of TOMMY
GUNS hidden there.
ANGLES ON: GUNS are handed out.
ANGLE ON: MOONLIGHT steams into the CAVE ... KONG sits on his
LEDGE, HE CRADLES ANN IN HIS ARM.
CLOSE ON: ANN SLEEPS PEACEFULLY in his HAND.
ANGLE ON: KONG gently lifts ANN ... he STARES at her ... his
FINGER touches ANN'S HAIR.
96.
KONG ROARS with ANGER and GRIEF.
ANGLE ON: ANN is seated alone in a DRESSING ROOM, she is putting
on STAGE MAKEUP. There is an emptiness in her face. She appears
DISCONNECTED, her thoughts on things far away.
WIDE ON: The THEATRE LOBBY is teaming with people, handing COATS
and HATS to the CHECK-IN GIRLS on the CLOAKROOM.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM who is WARMLY GREETING ZELMAN along with the
SLEAZY and THUGGISH INVESTOR ... both of whom have STARLETS
hanging on their arms ...

PRESTON'S EYE ...
ANGLE ON: DENHAM turns away and turns on an INSTANT SMILE for
a
waiting PHOTOGRAPHER.
PUSHING IN ON: PRESTON ...
ON THE SOUNDTRACK a sudden burst of UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER!
DREW V/O
Look at yourself! Look at what you've
become!
ANGLE ON: EDGAR, a young man, DRESSED as a WOMAN is pulled to one
side by his FRIEND, DREW. They are on the STAGE SET of a HOTEL
LOBBY. A LARGE BOWL of FRUIT sits on a DECORATIVE SIDEBOARD.
DREW
No woman is worth this!
EDGAR
This woman is worth it. I've gotta win
her back. I don't care what it takes.
DREW
She's not gonna buy it for a second!
EDGAR
Shuddup and hand me the grapefruit.
EDGAR proceeds to stuff a LARGE GRAPEFRUIT down his BRASSIERE.
THE AUDIENCE BREAKS into LAUGHTER. THE CAMERA PANS along a row in
a SMALL FRINGE THEATRE, and comes to rest on a THEATRE PROGRAMME
in the hands a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN. The front cover reads: "Cry
Havoc" by Jack Driscoll.
PULL FOCUS to reveal: JACK sitting behind the WOMAN, intently
watching the stage ...
ANGLE ON: JAYNE a BLONDE ACTRESS who looks similar to ANN, and
THELMA, her CONFIDANT, entering THE HOTEL LOBBY from the other
side of the STAGE ...
107.
THELMA
Tell me everything - every little
detail!
They sit on a SOFA as EDGAR takes a seat in an ARMCHAIR nearby.
JAYNE
So, he took me to a fancy French
restaurant ...
THELMA
French, huh?
JAYNE
Anyway about half way through the
whore derves - he clutches my hand ...
THELMA
He clutches your hand?!
EDGAR
(falsetto)
It felt like the right thing to do at
the time.
(falsetto)
Oh! I'm sorry - I couldn't help but
over-hear!
The TWO WOMEN look at him a beat before turning back to each
other.
JAYNE
He's looking into my eyes -
THELMA
And that's when he told you how he
felt?
JAYNE
No - he never said it.
THELMA
He never said it?!
EDGAR
(falsetto)
He probably thought he didn't need to
say it.
AUDIENCE LAUGHS!
THELMA
Then how does she know that it's real?
JAYNE
He said it was not about the words.
THELMA
Please - if you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.
108.
JAYNE
He said we'd talk about it later. Only
there was no later ...
CAMERA PUSHES IN on JACK ....
AYNE (cont'd)
It never happened.
(reflective)
I just thought that maybe this one
time, things might actually work out -
which was really very ...
LOSE ON: JACK, hearing his own words ...
JACK/JAYNE
... foolish ....
UDDENLY JACK stands and making his way past surprised
AUDIENCE
MEMBERS, heads for the EXIT.
HELMA
Men! They'll give you the world ...
But they let the one thing that truly
matters slip through their fingers.
All for the sake of three little
words!
EDGAR
(indignant)
The three hardest words in the English
language!
AUDIENCE MEMBERS break into fresh LAUGHTER as JACK leaves the
THEATRE.
CLOSE ON: CARL DENHAM quietly waiting in the WINGS of the HUGE
BROADWAY THEATRE. It is a moment of calm ... he is feeling a
mixture of PRIDE and ANTICIPATION.
The SOUND of KONG BREATHING - a RASPING WEAK GROWL - causes DENHAM
to flick his eyes to the darkened AREA behind the CURTAIN.
ANGLE ON: ANN in HER DRESSING ROOM pulling on her COSTUME.
109.
WIDE ON: The HUGE AUDITORIUM is filled with nearly 2000 people.
The EXCITEMENT in the air is PALPABLE.
WIDE ON: The LARGE CROWD APPLAUDS as DENHAM strides onto the stage
in the GLARE of THE SINGLE SPOTLIGHT. He waves enthusiastically to
the AUDIENCE, basking in the acclaim he
has wanted for so long.
DENHAM
hank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank
you! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am here
to tell you a very strange story ... a
story of our adventure in which
seventeen of our party suffered
horrible deaths! Their lives lost in
pursuit of a savage Beast, a monstrous
aberration of nature! But even the
meanest brute can be tamed. Yes,
Ladies and Gentlemen, as you will see,
the Beast was no match for the charms
of a girl - a girl from New York ...
who melted his heart. Bringing to mind
that old Arabian proverb ...
CLOSE ON: ANN, now in a WHITE VELVET GOWN, a look of SADNESS
in
her EYES.
DENHAM V/O cont'd)
"And lo the Beast looked upon the face
of Beauty and Beauty stayed his hand
... and from that day forward he was
as one dead ..."
A VOICE interrupts ANN'S contemplation.
STAGE MANAGER
You're on, Miss Darrow, five minutes.
ANN stands up ...
DENHAM basking in the SPOTLIGHT.
DENHAM
nd now Ladies & Gentlemen, I'm going
to show you the greatest thing your
eyes have ever beheld. He was a King
in the world he knew but he comes to
D
you now ... a captive!
DENHAM lifts his ARMS ...
110.
DENHAM (cont'd)
Ladies and gentlemen: I give you Kong -
the Eighth Wonder of the World!!
STAGE MUSIC strikes up.
WIDE ON: With a DRAMATIC FLOURISH the CURTAIN slowly rises to
REVEAL:
KONG sitting slumped and unresponsive, his WRISTS MANACLED to
a
STEEL SCAFFOLD. Other MANACLES and CHAINS secure his ANKLES, NECK
and WAIST.
There is a BIG GASP from the AUDIENCE ... KONG'S sheer size is
OVERWHELMING.
CLOSE ON: DENHAM ... euphoric, as the collective GASP of 2000
PEOPLE washes over him.
NGLE ON: KONG's head lolls, as if he is barely aware of his
surroundings ...
DENHAM
Don't be alarmed, ladies and
gentlemen. It is perfectly safe. These
chains are made of chrome steel!
WILD APPLAUSE!
WIDE ON: DENHAM on stage with KONG ...
DENHAM
dramatic)
Observe if you will, I am touching the
beast! I am actually laying my hand on
the twenty-five foot gorilla.
DENHAM reaches up and touches KONG'S LEG. KONG'S foot twitches
slightly causing DENHAM to jump back in fright ...
LOSE ON: JACK enters the AUDITORIUM.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM signals to the STAGE HANDS in the WINGS ...
111.
ANGLE ON: A STAGE HAND begins to CRANK a WINCH ... the CHAINS
at KONG'S WRISTS tighten ... the AUDIENCE GASP as KONG is SLOWLY
FORCED to his FULL HEIGHT ...
ANGLE ON: JACK walks into the BACK of the BALCONY of the
darkened AUDITORIUM. He quietly makes his way down the SHADOWED
AISLE.
NGLE ON: DENHAM turns back to face the AUDIENCE ...
DENHAM (cont'd)
We have in the auditorium tonight, a
surprise guest. The real life hero of
this story ... the man who hunted down
the mighty "Kong"!
CLOSE ON: JACK as he watches DENHAM, unnerved by the SPECTACLE.
DENHAM (cont'd)
The man who risked all to win the
freedom of a helpless female! A big
hand for ... Mr. Bruce Baxter!
ANGLE ON: BRUCE striding on stage, dressed as the Great White
Hunter.
UGE AUDIENCE ACCLAIM! DENHAM shakes BRUCE by the hand, slapping
him on the BACK as if they were OLD FRIENDS ... BRUCE turns and
acknowledges the ADULATION of the AUDIENCE.
A LINE of DANCERS, dressed as cheesy NATIVES appear from
either
side of the stage. They dance to the beat, playing to KONG, who
stares impassively at them.
A PULSATING DRUM BEAT begins to fill the AUDITORIUM!
DENHAM (cont'd)
Ladies and Gentlemen, imagine if you
will an uncharted island ... a
forgotten fragment from another time
... And clinging to life in this
savage place, imagine a people
untutored in the ways of the civilised
world. A people who have dwelt all
their lives in the shadow of Fear! In
the shadow of ... "Kong"!
CLOSE ON: JACK ... staring TRANSFIXED at the STAGE.
EHIND him in the DARKNESS of the AUDITORIUM a FIGURE rises
from a SEAT.
PRESTON
(quietly)
He was right ...
JACK turns to find PRESTON standing beside him ...
112.
PRESTON (cont'd)
... about there still being some
mystery left in this world ...
CLOSE ON: PRESTON stares down at the figure of DENHAM,
standing
to one side of the STAGE ...
PRESTON (cont'd)
(softly)
And we can all have a piece of it ...
for the price of an admission ticket.
ANGLE ON: PRESTON turns to look at JACK ... JACK'S EYES
flicker
towards the SCAR which runs down one side of PRESTON'S CHEEK ...
JACK
(quietly)
That's the thing you come to learn
about Carl ... his unfailing ability
to destroy the things he loves.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he strides to the FRONT of the STAGE ...
DENHAM
lease remain calm, Ladies and
Gentlemen - for we now come to the
climax of this savage ritual ... the
Sacrifice of a beautiful young girl!
The CROWD erupts into WILD CHEERS!
he LIGHTS DIM ... The DRUM BEAT increases ... The NATIVE
DANCERS fall to their KNEES in WORSHIP as a PLATFORM rises
from
beneath the STAGE ...
DENHAM (cont'd)
Behold her terror as she is offered up
to the mighty "Kong"! A big hand folks
for the bravest girl I ever met! Miss
Ann Darrow!
A DRAMATIC SILHOUETTE of a WOMAN dressed in a WHITE SILK GOWN.
She is tied to a wooden ALTAR, her BACK to the audience.
CLOSE ON: KONG, a flicker of HOPE in his EYES.
The TINY FIGURE tethered to the ALTAR looks up! For the first
time KONG sees her FACE.
A
NGLE ON: KONG utterly CONFUSED; this is NOT ANN, but a woman in a
blonde wig, dressed to look LIKE HER!
ONG roars!
FAKE ANN thrashes around SCREAMING unconvincingly!
FAKE ANN
No! No! Help me, no!
113.
ANGLE ON: KONG staring at FAKE ANN with mounting CONFUSION and
ANGER!
CLOSE ON: JACK as he realises it is not ANN on stage. He turns
to PRESTON.
JACK
Where is she??
CLOSE ON: JACK glances at PRESTON, who turns away looking
UNCOMFORTABLE.
JACK
(urgent)
Where's Ann?
PRESTON
I've no idea. I heard he offered her
all kinds of money and she turned him
down flat.
SLOW, DREAMY MUSIC ... A FEATHERED FAN sweeps across a FACE
to
reveal ... ANN.
WIDER: ANN dancing in a LINE of CHORUS GIRLS, all identically
dressed ...
ANGLE ON: A MALE DANCER slides into VIEW ... the STAR of the SHOW
... the WOMEN behind him, merely window dressing.
PUSH IN: on ANN as she goes through the motions of the
routine
... a look of DISTANT SORROW on her FACE.
CLOSE ON: PHOTOGRAPHERS push forward, LIGHT BULBS flash at
KONG
who ROARS ANGRILY.
DENHAM signals to BRUCE to join him ... behind them we can see the
FAKE ANN still performing her feigned terror ...
DENHAM
Here's your story, boys - "Beauty and
the Man who saved her from the Beast".
ANGLE ON: JACK watching from the BALCONY ... he STARES at KONG who
is BREATHING HARD through his NOSTRILS ... JACK can feel KONG'S
mounting ANGER.
JACK
(turning to PRESTON)
We have get these people out of here -
114.
JACK'S eyes turn to the AUDIENCE seated nearby ... he gets up and
attempts to usher people out.
JACK (cont'd)
Everyone has to leave.
CLOSE ON: KONG, his ANGER growing as he struggles against his
chains.
PRESS MAN 2
How did you feel, Mr. Baxter - when
you were on the island?
BRUCE
Well to be honest with you, I had some
anxious moments ...
The MEMBERS of the PRESS all nod, understandingly ...
BRUCE (cont'd)
For a while there it looked like I
wasn't going to get paid ... But as it
turned out, Mr. Denham here has been
more than generous -
CLOSE ON: DENHAM ...
DENHAM
et him roar! It makes a swell

AUDIENCE 2
Get your own seat Buddy - you ain't
having mine.
The CONFUSED AUDIENCE continue to APPLAUD ...
CLOSE ON: The FAKE ANN'S EYES suddenly WIDEN as:
KONG rips one of his MANACLED HANDS FREE!
AKE ANN lets out her most CONVINCING SCREAM!
JOURNALISTS and PHOTOGRAPHERS start backing away, snapping
pictures as they retreat ... FLASHBULBS POP ... KONG COWERS
BACK
shielding his eyes ... ROARING in DEFIANCE!
ANOTHER DEAFENING ROAR!!! DENHAM looks up, AWESTRUCK, as he
sees
KONG TEARING FREE of the rest of his CHAINS!!
The AUDIENCE BEGIN TO RISE from their SEATS ... PANIC sets in!
115.
AAAARRRRRGH!!!!! The FAKE ANN tethered to the ALTAR screams again
for help!
KONG reaches across and picks her up, HURLING the FAKE ANN and the
ALTAR across the wide AUDITORIUM!
LOW MOTION: LINKS snapping ... CHAINS breaking, BOLTS lifting
from the FLOOR!
With a MIGHTY FLOURISH, KONG rips off his WAIST RESTRAINTS and is
at last completely FREE! The AUDIENCE RUSH the EXITS in a
COLLECTIVE STAMPEDE!
KONG swings from the STAGE into the FRONT ROW SEATS ...
STOMPING
and CRUSHING the slower moving PATRONS!
KONG ROARS and hurls a PLASTER CORNICE across the length of the
THEATRE - straight at JACK!
ONG is now below the BALCONY LEVEL ...
n that moment KONG turns ... and sees JACK! For a brief second
their EYES LOCK!
NGLE ON: KONG using his amazing STRENGTH to SWING up to the UPPER
LEVEL BOXES ... with a LEAP he jumps on to the BALCONY ... the
BALCONY crumbles under his WEIGHT ... sending DOZENS
OF PEOPLE
plummeting into the STALLS.
ACK turns and RUNS for the DOOR as KONG struggles to REACH
him.
JACK reaches the EXIT, turns and looks back at KONG, a mixture of
DREAD and AWE on his FACE.
CLOSE ON: DENHAM remains in the middle of the THEATRE
mesmerized
by the spectacle of KONG'S unleashing power!
CLOSE ON:
JACK'S FOOT depresses ACCELERATOR.
The WHEELS are SPINNING WILDLY ... in a CLOUD OF BURNING RUBBER,
the CAB speeds down the ROAD, weaving in and out of the path cut
by KONG'S DESTRUCTION.
KONG BOUNDS AFTER THE CAB, running on all FOURS with incredible
speed.
JACK crosses an INTERSECTION, driving up on the SIDEWALK to get a
CLEARER DRIVING LANE ... PEDESTRIANS scatter - not only from the
CAB, but from KONG who is in HOT PURSUIT.
T
he CAB SLEWS across the STREET, disappearing up a TINY ALLEY,
only just wide enough for the CAB, but TOO NARROW for KONG.
JACK glances back at KONG, ROARING with frustration at the ALLEY
ENTRANCE.
JACK speeds out of the ALLEY and CROSSES the TRAFFIC FLOW, causing
much BRAKING and HORN action. He gets SLOWED in THICK TRAFFIC ...
KONG BURSTS his way out of the ALLEY ENTRANCE ... RIGHT IN FRONT
OF JACK'S CAB!!!
JACK SWERVES on to the SIDEWALK ...
118.
JACK steers the CAB wildly along the SIDEWALK scattering
PEDESTRIANS in all directions!
KONG follows in HOT PURSUIT!
ACK sends the CAB into a couple of TIGHT TURNS ... he rounds a
bend and DRIVES straight into a FRUIT VENDOR'S STALL!
ANGLE ON: The CAB, covered by the RUINED STALL, SLAMS into the
WALL of a BUILDING. JACK is thrown forward on IMPACT ...
KONG rounds the corner and BOUNDS PAST JACK'S CAB ... hidden
beneath the RUBBLE ...
KONG searches for the CAB, ROARING in FRUSTRATION!
KONG'S HUGE EYES glance in the WINDOW, just as:
KONG suddenly FREEZES! He inclines his HEAD; unsure if what he is
seeing is REAL.
KONG'S POV: ANN is walking towards him!
KONG tentatively inches TOWARDS ANN!
ANN stops ... KONG stops. They stare at each other for a long
moment ... ANN offers KONG a small SMILE, and reaches her HAND out
hesitantly towards his ARM.
K
ONG gently picks ANN up ... his EYES never leaving her FACE.
ANN holds tightly on to his HAND and they DISAPPEAR into the
night.
ANGLE ON: JACK RACES into a LIFT and hurriedly punches the BUTTON
... nothing happens ...
LD SECURITY GUARD
Hey, hey, nobody past this point. You
can't go in there.
JACK pushes past the OLD SECURITY GUARD!
ANGLE ON: JACK races round a corner ... races into the SERVICE
ELEVATOR ... the doors slowly close.
NGLE ON:ANN staggers to her FEET and races outside to the
balcony, desperately looking for KONG.
KONG looks FEARFUL ... he is WEAKENING from his BULLET WOUNDS.
