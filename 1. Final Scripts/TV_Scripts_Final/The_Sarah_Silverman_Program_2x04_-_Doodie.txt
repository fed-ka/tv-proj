      Sarah, transfixed by the show, is only half listening.

      Mini Coffee glides between the two contestant s kitchen 
      stations.  One of the contestants is EMILY, an earnest, 
        plainly-dressed, New England-y NPR foodie type.  The other 
      is a team of two male cheerleaders - THE MUSTANGS (the 
      thugs who assaulted and mugged Steve last year).  Mini 
      Coffee peruses the Mustangs  cookie.

                      Now this is interesting.  The light dust 
                      of frosting makes it look like a piece of 
                      white dog poop.  Remember how back in the 
                      seventies, dog poop turned white?
                      Whatever happened to that, Ookie?  You 
                      never see that anymore.
                              (hand on her heart)
                      Oh my goodness, my producer is signalling 
                      that the votes are in.

                      Hey you guys.  Congratulations!

                      now if you hurt gay people, it s like, 
                      even more illegal than if you hurt 
                      regular people.

                      No, you didn t.

                                        BRIAN
                      Steve, I did too.

                                        STEVE
                      It s okay, dude.  You re just not 
                      political.

                                        BRIAN

      EXT. CEMETARY - DAY (D2)

      Laura and Sarah walk through the cemetary towards their 
      mother s grave. 

                                        LAURA
                      Cemetery lawns are always so pretty.  
                                (thinks)
                      I guess all the rotting flesh is good for 
                      the soil.      

                                        SARAH
                      Hey!

      Sarah points ahead of them, where Jay, PAUL and a few other 
      COPS are cordoning off a grave site with police tape.

                                        LAURA
                      Jay?

      Laura runs up to Jay, Sarah follows behind.

                                        LAURA (CONT D)
                      What s going on?  What happened?  This is 
                      my mother s grave.

                                        JAY
                      I know.
                                (hugging her tenderly)
                      I know.  And that will never change.  No 
                      matter what they do to it.

                                        LAURA
                      What??

      Jay and Paul lead Sarah away from the burial site.

                                        JAY
                                (takes a deep breath)
                      Okay.  This is not an easy one.  We re 
                      still piecing together what happened, but 
                      we know a few things.  Your mother s 
                      headstone has been stolen.  Probably by 
                      teenagers.

                                        LAURA
                      Are you kidding me??

      Sarah looks like  what the fuck?  

                                        JAY
                      There s more.

                      Look.  You know how today s teenagers can 
                      be.  They re mean, reckless... hormonal. 

                                        SARAH
                      Hormonal?

      Jay looks tense.  Paul puts his hand on Jay s shoulder.

                                        PAUL
                      You re doing great buddy.  

                                        JAY
                      These teenagers, they don t always pick 
                      on fair targets.  Sometimes they pick on 
                      old people, or dogs, or skeletons...

      A beat.

                                        LAURA
                      Did someone do something to our mother s 
                      skeleton?

                                        JAY
                                (getting emotional)
                      These damned kids... they performed a 
                      kind of... brutal version of...  making 
                      love  to your mother s skeleton. 

                                        LAURA
                      Oh my god!  

      Sarah looks more pensive than distraught.

                                        JAY
                      I wish it stopped there, I really do.  
                      But unfortunately, the perpetrators 
                      also... took several parts of the 
                      skeleton, either as souvenirs, or for 
                      further... relations.  They stole her 
                      pelvis, and, evidently, what they thought 
                      to be her... boob bones.  These 
                      teenagers, they don t understand 
                      anything. 

                                        LAURA
                      Oh, Jay!

      Laura begins to cry.  Jay holds her.

                                (taking Laura s and Sarah s 
                                hands)
                      This is not your fault. You have to know 
                      that.  It s not your fault.         5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      7.



                                        SARAH
                      Wait, I don t get it.  Why does having 
                      sex with a skeleton feel good?  There 
                      must be, like, a million things you could 
                      rub your genitals against that would feel 
                      better.  And take way less effort to get.

      Laura sobs as Sarah continues her speech.

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      How do you even have the energy to have 
                      sex after digging up a grave?  That s six 
                      feet of dirt you re displacing.  I would 
                      need a nap before I even got three feet 
                      deep.  I mean, that combined with my 
                      Zoloft, I just don t think I d be in the 
                      mood.  I feel like I have energy - but 
                      these kids have, like, boundless energy.  
                      God, I never felt old before, but now I 
                      just feel ancient... Ugh, this whole 
                      thing is making me really depressed.
                              (to Laura)
                      I think I need you to take me home.

      Laura is sobbing in Jay s arms.

                              (Bart Simpson)
                      I need you to take me home, dude.

                      Wow, I guess from great tragedy comes 
                      great art.

                      Um, by the way, this was in your mother s 
                      coffin.

      Paul hands Laura an item stored inside a Ziplock bag.

      EXT. SILVERMAN HOUSE - DAY

      Sometime in the 70 s.  LITTLE LAURA comes to get LITTLE 
      SARAH, who is holding a stick and standing at the edge of 
      their yard, near the street. 

                                        LITTLE LAURA
                      Sarah, you have to come inside now. 
                      Mommy s very sick and she wants to say 
                      goodbye.

                                        LITTLE SARAH
                      Okay.  I ll be there in a minute.

      Little Laura sighs and goes back toward the house. 


      INT. SILVERMAN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Laura is at their mother ROSE S bedside.  Rose clutches the 
      recipe book in one hand, and Little Laura s hand in the 
      other.

                                        ROSE
                      Where is she?

                      She s on her way, mom.


      EXT. SILVERMAN HOUSE - SAME

      Little Sarah has speared a piece of dog poo on her stick 
      and waves it at passing cars.

                                        LITTLE SARAH
                                (yelling)
                      Doodie!


      INT. SILVERMAN HOUSE - SAME

      CLOSE ON the recipe book, which falls from Rose s hand to 
      the floor with thud.  Rose has expired.  Little Laura gives 
      her mother s limp body one last hug.  We hear the sound of 
      an EKG flatline tone.  PAN TO REVEAL Sarah, who stands in 
      the doorway with the doodie stick. 

                                        LITTLE SARAH
                              (very high pitch)
                          Poooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

      This is the flat-line sound we re hearing.         5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      9.

                      It s crazy.  I mean if you asked me two

      Sarah and Laura are behind the scenes of their favorite 
      show, awestruck.  It s a hive of activity, PEOPLE with

                              (to Sarah)
                      Why would it have to be a Tuesday?


      INT. COOKIE PARTY - AUDIENCE - LATER

      Brian, Steve and Jay are in the audience. The WARM UP GUY 
      is doing crowd work with a hand held microphone.

                                        WARM UP GUY
                              (to audience)
                      Mini Coffee s gonna be out very soon, and 
                      we re gonna start the show!

      CHEERS from the AUDIENCE.  The Warm Guy approaches Brian.

                                        WARM UP GUY (CONT D)
                      Evening, sir.  What s your name?

                                        BRIAN
                      Uh, Brian.

                                        WARM UP GUY
                      All right.  So let s get into Brian.  
                      What do you do, Brian?  

                                        BRIAN
                      Uh... well, I like talking about 
                      politics.

                                        WARM UP GUY
                      Oh, yeah?  Lay it on us, man.  Drop some 
                      politics up in this hizzy!

      Encouraging APPLAUSE.

                                        BRIAN
                      All right, well... you know.  We just 
                      have to get the whole foreign situation 
                      under control.

      The crowd is silent.  Warm Up Guy waits for more.

                                        WARM UP GUY
                      How  bout that?  Looks like we got 
                      ourselves a regular George Stephanopoulos

      The audience LAUGHS.  Steve is mortified.  The Warm Up Guy 
      high fives Jay.

                                        JAY
                                (realizing his error)
                      Sorry.

      The LIGHTS DIM and The Cookie Party Orchestra begins 
      playing.

      The animated Cookie Party opening title sequence rolls.

      A BIG COOKIE CLOCK BEGINS TO  TICK.  Both teams begin 
      baking.  As they do, the audience is treated to 
        biographical video packages, a la American Idol.

                                        LAURA (V.O.)
                      Our mother introduced us to Cookie Party.  
                      She loved Cookie Party more than 
                      anything, and the three of us used to 
                      watch it together all the time.  But she 
                      died when we were very young.


      INT. SARAH S LIVING ROOM - DAY

      FOOTAGE: The video cuts to Laura sitting on the couch in 
      Sarah s apartment, talking to camera.  She starts to tear 
      up.

                      So this is just our way of saying-

                      Yeah, uh, when I was a kid, I had all 
                      these dreams and stuff...

                      I think everybody should get a chance to 
                      have dreams, even if they re gay or got 
                      other stuff wrong, like they can t walk.

      Stencil throws a drumstick at the camera and laughs.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

      Mini Coffee looks at a cookie.

                                        MINI COFFEE
                      Mm.  This one looks like it tastes like 
                      it s from the moon or something.  I like 
                      the moon... and allergy medicine. 

      The Mustangs high five each other.  THE PRODUCER HANDS A 
      CARD TO MINI.

                                        MINI COFFEE (CONT D)
                      Oh, Thank you, Philip.
                                (reads, fans self)
                      Ladies and gentlemen, you are simply not 
                      going to believe this but for the first 
                      time in Cookie Party history, tonight s  
                        competition... is a draw!

      The crowd CHEERS.  Sarah and Laura are psyched.  The 
      Mustangs look pissed.        5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      18.

                              (to Ookie)
                      Now this means we ll be seeing both teams 
                      tomorrow night.

      Ookie whispers in Mini s ear.

                                        MINI COFFEE (CONT D)
                      That s right, Ookie.  Both cookie bakers 
                      get to make dedications.  Terrific!  
                      We ll start with our challengers.

      Mini Coffee, Ookie and the fainting couch SLIDE OVER to 
      Sarah and Laura.  Mini hands Laura the microphone.

                                        LAURA
                      Hi.  I m Laura.  Well, this is really 
                      special for me and Sarah.  When we were 
                      very young, we lost someone dear to us, 
                      and we d like to dedicate our cookie to 
                      our--

      A PICTURE comes up on the green screen monitor behind them: 
      it s a PILE OF DOODIE.

                                        SARAH
                                (gleefully to the world)
                      Doodie!!!

      The audience LAUGHS.  Laura looks confused.  She turns 
      around to see the wall monitor.  She turns to Sarah in 
      horror. 

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                                (whispers)
                      I m sorry, Laura.  I made an executive 
                      decision.

                                        END OF ACT TWO       5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      19.



                                        ACT THREE


      INT. LAURA S CAR - NIGHT

      Laura drives Sarah home.  Laura is livid.  Sarah is 
      oblivious.

                                        LAURA
                      I give up, Sarah. You re on your own 
                      tomorrow. 

                                        SARAH
                      What?  Why??  

                                        LAURA
                      I m quitting the team. 

                                        SARAH
                      Really?  Why?  Really?

                                        LAURA
                      We were supposed to do this as a tribute 
                      to Mom, not to your gross obsession with 
                      doodie.

      Sarah coughs short bursts of air in disbelief.

                                        LAURA (CONT D)
                      I mean, what is it with you?  Have you 
                      ever thought about what it is you find so 
                      funny about doodie?

                                        SARAH
                      Of course not, Laura.  If you deconstruct 
                      something, it s not funny anymore.  What 
                      are you, twelve?

                                        LAURA
                      Oh, I m twelve?

                                        SARAH
                      Yes, you are.  I mean, think about it: 
                      you wanted to be a nurse when you grew 
                      up, and now you are one.  

      Laura pulls the car to the side of the road.

                                        LAURA
                      Just get out of my car. You can walk 
                      home.       5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      20.



                                        SARAH
                      Fine!  Your car smells like farts anyway.  
                      As always.

      Sarah gets out of the car, and Laura peels away.


      INT. BRIAN AND STEVE S LIVING ROOM - DAY (D4)

      Brian enters from outside.  He quickly turns on the TV.

                                        BRIAN
                                (calling)
                      Hey Steve!  Come here!  The news is on!

      Steve enters.

                                        STEVE
                      So?

                      Mayor Wittels is giving this awesome 
                      press conference.  We should check it 
                      out.

      Steve SIGHS and rolls his eyes.


      ON TV:


      INT. PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

      The press conference is just wrapping up.  Mayor Wittels 
      sounds surprisingly like Sarah s impression of him from 
      earlier.

                                        MAYOR WITTELS
                      ... And we, uhhhh, we expect the budget 
                      to be approved by city council, at which 
                      point we will, uhhhh, begin our roadway 
                        beautification program.

      A sea of hands go up in the crowd.

                                        MAYOR WITTELS (CONT D)
                      Yes.  The gentleman with the glasses.

      It s Brian.

                                        BRIAN (ON TV)
                      Mayor, I d like to know what you re going 
                      to do about the whole foreign situation. 
                      Don t you think it s a mess?       5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      21.



      A beat.

                                        MAYOR WITTELS
                      Uhhhh, I m not sure I follow.

                                        BRIAN (ON TV)
                      And don t you think we should increase 
                      the environment?  And Bosnia?

                                        MAYOR WITTELS
                      Sir, I simply don t understand your, 
                      uhhh, line of questioning.

                                        BRIAN (ON TV)
                      Would you at least say that we re having 
                      a political discussion? 

                                        MAYOR WITTELS
                      Well, uh, you are saying words and 
                      phrases that can be classified as 
                      political, and I guess this qualifies as 
                        a discussion...

      Brian (ON TV) turns to the camera and gives an incredibly 
      lame, cocky smile.

      INT. BACKSTAGE AT COOKIE PARTY STUDIOS - NIGHT (N4)

      Sarah arrives.  She walks tentatively down the hall, 
      looking fearful.

                      Oh my God, look who it is, Jojo!

      PAN TO REVEAL that Sarah is now face to face with the 
      Mustangs!  Stencil has something stuffed under his shirt 
      that look like boobs.

      Clank-ity clank!  Stencil s  boobs  fall out of his shirt.  
      They are bones!  Sarah stares at them, bewildered.  A long, 
      silent beat.

      headstone!!  Sarah GASPS.

      Sarah bites her lip in frustration.

                                        STENCIL (CONT D)
                      You want it back, all you gotta do is 
                      beat the Mustangs.  Can you do that?  Can 
                      you do that without your little sister?

      The Mustangs enter their dressing room and shut the door.  
      Sarah is shaken.


      INT. ROMANSKI S - NIGHT

      Laura and Jay are at the bar, having a drink.

                                        JAY
                      You made the right decision quitting the 
                        competition.

                                        LAURA
                      You think?  I m worried I was too harsh.

      Jay puts his arm around Laura, and tenderly comforts her.       5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      24.



                                        JAY
                      When Sarah showed that picture of... of 
                      feces, she disrespected you and your 
                      mother.  I mean, how much more suffering 
                      does your mother have to endure?  First 
                      she dies, then her skeleton gets dug up 
                      and sexually violated, then pieces of it 
                      are stolen, presumably to be had sex with 
                      over and over throughout eternity.  Then 
                      her memory is literally soiled by a 
                      picture of a B.M.  It s just outrageous.

      A beat.

                                        LAURA
                                (sweetly)
                      Thanks for comforting me, Jay.  I m lucky 
                      to have you.

                                        JAY
                      Of course, babe.  

      But Laura looks disconsolate again.  Jay assesses her.

                                        JAY (CONT D)
                              (to Laura)
                      You want to watch Cookie Party, don t 
                      you.

      Laura nods, a bit guiltily.  Jay grabs the remote from the 
      counter and turns on the TV.

                              (low key)
                      Well, Silverman.  Even though you lost, I 
                      guess the right thing to do would be to 
                      let you keep your mom s headstone.

                                        SARAH
                      That would be awesome.

                      I m a man of honor.  And I swore on my 
                      honor that I would give this back to you 
                      if you won.  Unfortunately... we won!!

                      Mustangs!!

      Stencil puts on a scooter helmet.  We CUT WIDE TO REVEAL 
      that Jojo is on a Vespa scooter that has a wagon hitched to 
      the back.  In the wagon is Rose s headstone.  Stencil hops 
      on the seat behind Jojo.  


      INT. SARAH S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Sarah says good night to Doug.

                                        SARAH
                      Well, Doug, even though we didn t win, we 
                      sure learned a lot.

      The GHOST OF ROSE SILVERMAN gently materializes at Sarah s 
      bedside.

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      Mom??

                                        ROSE
                      Don t be afraid, Sarah.  I just wanted to 
                      tell you something.  Something I didn t 
                      get the chance to say to you before I 
                      died.  

                                        SARAH
                      What is it, Mom?

                                        ROSE
                      I want you always to remember that your 
                      sister Laura is very wise, and that it s 
                      your duty to listen her.

                                        SARAH
                      My... duty?       5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      31.



                                        ROSE
                      Yes.  It s an enormous duty.  And I know 
                      that enormous duties can really stink.

      As Sarah and Rose CRACK UP, we

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


      EXT. CEMETARY - EARLY MORNING

      The girls stand at their mother s grave site.  An 
      instrumental, adagio VERSION OF  WHITE DOG POO  plays 
      underneath the scene.  Sarah plants a stick where their 
      mother s headstone once was.  On top of the stick is a 
      piece of dog poo.  Laura stands up beside Sarah, they side-
      hug, and walk away hand in hand.  As they do, the dog poo 
      magically turns white.
