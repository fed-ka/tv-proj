      FADE IN:


11EXT.  SMITH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON - ESTABLISHING

      The sun has started to set on the stately Victorian mansion. 
      The CAMERA DRIFTS UP, PUSHING IN on a tiny attic window...

                                    J.J. (O.S.)
                    This isn't fair.

                                      JOHNNY (O.S.)
                    Seems completely fair to me.

                                    J.J. (O.S.)
                    That's because you're... old.


22INT. SMITH HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

      J.J. BANNERMAN stands amidst a sea of dust-covered accumulated
      clutter; cardboard boxes, old furniture, a rusty bicycle. 
      Wearing an apron, he clutches a feather duster.

                                      JOHNNY (O.S.)
                    Old?  Now you've done it!

      JOHNNY staggers out from behind a stack of junk.  He's wearing
      an apron and holding a bottle of Windex.  He pretends to be
      wounded, something stuck in his back.

                                      JOHNNY
                    See if you can pull that knife out
                    of my back.  Go ahead, just yank it
                    out.

      J.J. can't help but smile.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're lucky the attic is all you've
                    got to clean.  Walt mentioned
                    something about public toilets and a
                      toothbrush.

      J.J.'s eye widen slightly at the thought...

                                      JOHNNY
                    You light Mrs. Nagley's garbage can
                    on fire?  Whassup wid dat?


                                                                (CONTINUED)                      DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - TEASER - 8/29/05 - PINK   2.

2CONTINUED:2

                                    J.J.
                    It was an accident. 

                                      JOHNNY
                    I was born at night, but not last
                    night.  Promise me, no more fire.

                                    J.J.
                    Promise.

      Johnny pulls back a dusty sheet, revealing a small antique
      steamer trunk (1930's).

                                      JOHNNY
                    Check this out.  This must have
                    belonged to my grandfather, John. 
                    He built this house.

      J.J. carefully unfastening the trunk's buckles.

                                    J.J.
                    It stinks.

                                      JOHNNY
                    It's been packed away for nearly 60
                    years.

      Swinging open the lid...

      STEAMER TRUNK - INSIDE

      Clothing, books, personal effects; relics of the 30's & 40's.

                                    J.J. (O.S.)
                    No treasure.

      RESUME JOHNNY AND J.J.

      Johnny sorts through, pulling out an assortment of items.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That depends on your definition of
                    valuable.

      J.J. finds an old pocket knife.

                                    J.J.
                    Look at this!

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'll hang on to that.

      He reaches out and takes the knife... WHOOSH!                       DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - TEASER - 8/29/05 - PINK   3.



33MOVE, MATCH, MORPH AROUND THE ATTIC

      The LAUGHTER of children invades the space as the clutter
      disappears and years of dirt and debris vanish.  Two boys
      streak past Observer Johnny -- YOUNG HERB SMITH (10) and a
      Japanese boy, KOJI SAKURA. Young Herb retrieves the whittling
      knife from his pocket.

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    I got an idea.  I'll carve our names
                    so they'll be here forever.

                                    KOJI
                    Best friends? 

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    Best friends. 

      He begins to carve, WHOOSH!


44RESUME JOHNNY

      As he crosses to the support beam and wipes away the dust.

      INSERT - THE BEAM

      Herb and Koji.  B.F. (Best Friends)

      JOHNNY

      studies the message as the DOORBELL RINGS.

                                    J.J.
                    I'll get it!

      Johnny intercepts him.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Nice try.  Do me a favor and drag
                    that trunk down to the basement.

                                    J.J.
                    By myself?

                                      JOHNNY
                          (old man's voice)
                    Can't expect an old codger like me
                    to do it!  Might break my hip!

      The DOORBELL RINGS again, as Johnny heads downstairs.

      J.J. starts loading items back into the trunk, then makes an
      exciting discovery... a tarnished ZIPPO LIGHTER.  He hesitates
      a beat, then slips the lighter into his shirt pocket.                      DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - TEASER - 8/29/05 - PINK   4.



55INT. SMITH HOUSE - FOYER - SAME TIME

      Johnny's greeted by frantic KNOCKING at the front door.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Okay, okay...

      As he grabs the door handle... WHOOSH! 


66INT. JOHNSONS' HOME - LIVING ROOM - VISION

      The front door flies open, as RANDY JOHNSON (16) enters; a
      school backpack over his shoulder.

                                    RAND
                    Dad, I'm home! 

      He nonchalantly drops his bag in the middle of the floor, as
      he passes Observer Johnny on his way into the...


77JOHNSONS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 

      Randy opens the refrigerator, but the light doesn't go on...

                                      RANDY
                    What happened to the power?!

      Grabs phone receiver off the wall and puts it to his ear.

                                      RANDY
                    Phone's dead, too!

      Puts the phone back, then reaches for the carton of milk. 

                                      RANDY
                    I better drink the milk before it
                    goes bad!

      He grabs a full carton of milk and takes a deep chug; he
      turns and STOPS in mid-chug.  He lowers the carton, his EYES
      LOCKED on something across the kitchen, as he drops it...

      TIGHT ON MILK CARTON - SLO-MOTION

      The carton hits floor and EXPLODES! 

      WIDER TO INCLUDE - STEVEN JOHNSON

      The lifeless body of Randy's FATHER lies face down in a pool
      of blood.  Randy stands frozen in terror...

                                      RANDY
                    Dad?

                    Daddy can't help you.

      Randy spins, encountering CABOT (26), a wiry young man in a
      pair of Telephone Company work overalls.

                                      RANDY
                    Who are you? 

                                      CABOT
                    I think you know. 

      He grabs for Randy but the kid strafes away, sprinting back
      into the next room.  Cabot smiles to himself...


88LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Randy bolts through the doorway, only to be confronted across
      the room by a bigger man, ZED (45).

                                    ZED
                    Goin' somewhere, boyo? 

      Randy notices the pistol with a silencer in Zed's hand, and
      bolts towards the front door.  Zed raises the gun as he takes
      a single step forward.  As he FIRES, his foot hits the
      backpack on the hardwood and he slides.  A volley of muted
      shots split the wooden door frame behind Randy as he vanishes
      out the front door.


99EXT. DRIVEWAY/STREET - CONTINUOUS

      Randy sprints up the driveway, past Observer Johnny.  A split
      second of hesitation before he runs across the street and up
      the driveway past a mailbox which reads, 'J. SMITH'.  WHOOSH!


1010INT. SMITH HOUSE - FOYER - ON JOHNNY

      Johnny opens the door to find Randy, his hand still gripping
      the opposing door handle.

                                      RANDY
                          (desperate)
                    Help me!  Please!

      Off Johnny's reaction...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


1111INT. SMITH HOUSE - FOYER - LATE AFTERNOON

      Johnny ushers Randy in, closing the door behind him (in the
      excitement, he forgets to lock it).

                                      RANDY
                    I'm sorry... I didn't know...
                          (emotional)
                    They killed him.  They came in the
                    house and they shot my father. 
                          (beat, suddenly)
                    I have to go back!

      Johnny stops him.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Hold on.  Take a deep breath.
                          (beat)
                    You live across the street, right?
                          (Randy nods)
                    Your name is...?

                                      RANDY
                      Johnson... Randy Johnson.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Randy.  I'm John.

                                      RANDY
                    I know who you are.  Everybody
                    knows...
                          (he stops, sees
                            something in Johnny's
                            eyes)
                    You saw it, didn't you?  You saw it
                    all.

      Johnny doesn't need to answer, it's all there in his eyes.

                                      JOHNNY
                    The men in your house, have you ever
                    seen them before?

      Randy shakes his head.

                                      RANDY
                          (emotional)
                    They murdered my father.  And I'm
                    next.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Why would they want to hurt you?

                                      RANDY
                          (sudden urgency)
                    We have to get out of here!

      He takes a few steps as his leg buckles in pain.  Johnny
      notices the trail of blood behind him.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're bleeding.

                                      RANDY
                          (slightly freaked out)
                    My leg.  They shot me.

      Randy lifts his bloodied hand, as he struggles to keep from
      passing out.

                                      JOHNNY
                    It's okay.

      Randy grabs Johnny in a fit of desperation.

                                      RANDY
                    You don't understand.  They'll be
                    coming.  They'll kill us both.  You
                    have to call the police.

      Their eyes meet as Johnny can see how terrified he is.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Okay.  There's a phone in the kitchen.


1212INT. SMITH HOUSE - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

      Johnny helps Randy to a bar stool, then picks up the wall
      phone.

                                      RANDY
                    What's wrong?

                                      JOHNNY
                    There's no signal.

      As Johnny taps the connector button on the receiver... WHOOSH!

      SHOT PULLS BACK to REVEAL...


1414EXT. TELEPHONE POLE - EARLY EVENING - VISION

      Zed, the older killer, perched atop the pole disabling the
      telephony junction panel.  He calls down to his partner,
      Cabot, who stands next to a Telephone Company van.  Observer
      Johnny stands beside him watching.

                                    ZED
                    No more calls out of that house! 

                                      CABOT
                    Good.  Now let's go get the little
                    rat and finish this thing.

      Observer Johnny turns and realizes they are in front of his
      house.  WHOOSH!  


1515BACK TO JOHNNY

      slowly lowering the phone; he looks back to Randy who watches
      him with expectant eyes.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Cell phone.

      He TURNS, then STOPS suddenly and looks back at Randy...

                                      JOHNNY
                    I left it in the car.

      Johnny starts past Randy, who grabs him by the shirt sleeve.

                                      RANDY
                    Wait!

                                      JOHNNY
                    It's okay.  I'll be right back.

      He grabs his car keys off a wall-mounted hook.  UNHEARD
      WHOOSH!


1616EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Johnny slips cautiously out of the front door and crosses
      the driveway to the...  

      RANGE ROVER

      He cautiously checks the area around him, then slips open
      the driver's side door and leans in, frantically searching

      and then he finds it tucked up in the visor.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Thank you God.

      He steps away from the car...  

                                      CABOT (O.S.)
                    That's a damn nice truck.

      Johnny spins around to FIND Cabot holding a silenced 9mm
      pointed at him.

                                      CABOT
                    Think I'll take it with me.

      He FIRES a single SHOT directly into Johnny's chest!  WHOOSH!


1717RESUME SCENE - INT. KITCHEN - JOHNNY

      coming out of the vision, Johnny still has his hand on the
      car keys, as we realize it was just a Vision.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Forget the phone. 
                          (suddenly realizes)
                    The front door.  I forgot to lock
                    it.

      He takes off towards the door...

      TRACKING WITH JOHNNY - SLO-MOTION

      He slides up to it and grabs the handle as it begins to
      OPEN...

      Johnny struggles against the unidentified force pushing from
      the other side, until he finally gets it shut and snaps the
      dead bolt.  He rests his back against the door as a quick
      series of silent BULLETS RIP THROUGH THE WOOD NEXT TO HIS
      HEAD!

      KITCHEN

      Johnny rushes into the room and over to an alarm panel.

                                      JOHNNY
                    We stay inside.  I'll set the security

                    My father liked it here.  He felt
                    safe.  And they shot him in the head.

      Johnny can see this kid is in more than physical pain.

                                    J.J. (O.S.)
                    Who got shot?

      Johnny and Randy both react; as we REVEAL...

      J.J.

      He stands in the open doorway.  His curious eyes noticing
      the bloody trail on the floor.

                                    J.J.
                    Is that blood?

      Off the moment...

                    Sheriff, this is Federal Marshal
                    Dwight Connors. *

                    I'm calling in regards to a delicate
                      situation... A pending operation
                    we've been conducting in your County.

                    I'm not at liberty to discuss details. 
                    Let's just say it's in the nature of
                      a long-term, low-profile relocation.

                                      MARSHAL CONNORS*
                    We wouldn't normally reach out to
                    local law enforcement, but after
                    running a profile check on you and
                      considering the immediate nature of
                    our dilemma, we decided to roll the
                    dice.

                                    WALT

                    and sit on them until my team can
                    get there.

                    The kind that don't exist.  We haven't
                    been able to reach them on their
                    secured phone line.  And we have
                    strong reason to believe their
                      identities may have already been
                      compromised.

                    Sheriff, the people involved in this

                    situation with anyone, not even your
                    own people.

                    We'll have a team on the ground with
                    you inside three hours.

      Suddenly, Walt's FAX MACHINE springs to life behind him.

                                      MARSHAL CONNORS*
                    I'm sending you the information by

      Walt hangs up, then he grabs the fax sheet, his jacket, and
      heads out.  He passes Roscoe.

2222INT. SMITH HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING

      Johnny checks Randy's leg; J.J. at his side.

      Young Randy exits the bathroom and heads for the car, when a
      heated O.S. argument draws his attention around behind the

                    Hey, let's go.

      Steve becomes the second witness to... 

      HIS POV

      Marcus Perez and ANOTHER MAN face off.

                                      PEREZ
                    You have my money or not?

                    You're time just ran out.

      Perez pulls a .45 from his jacket and brutally shoots the
      other man... BANG!  BANG!  His attention suddenly shifts.

      REVERSE ON YOUNG RANDY AND STEVE

      having just witnessed the murder.  FLASH!

      Randy hesitates, then points directly at us... WHOOSH! 


2626RESUME ON JOHNNY

      Studying Randy from a new perspective.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You were very brave to testify in
                    court the way you did.  I know how
                    scared you must've been.

                                      RANDY
                          (the realization)
                      Everything they say about you is
                    true.

                    You're still shivering.  There's
                    some blankets in the closet.  J.J.,
                    you stay here.  I'll be right back.

      Johnny quickly exits, leaving J.J. and Randy alone.  AWKWARD
      PAUSE.  Then...

                                      RANDY
                    It must be cool having a psychic for
                    a dad.

                                    J.J.
                    It's okay.

                                      RANDY
                          (again reflecting)
                    My dad sold fertilizer.

      Off this bittersweet moment...

                    Let's just burn the place to the

                    No need to attract attention.

                    Simple science.  Electricity travels
                    through a circuit in an unintended
                    path, it causes a short.

                    I was.  In another life.  Reverse
                    the polarity and create a big enough
                    short, every circuit in the series
                    gets fried.

      Walt's cruiser pulls into the driveway.  Emerging from the
      car, he notices a PHONE COMPANY van parked out on the street. 
      He considers it, then crosses up the walk to the front door.

      His first knock pushes the unlatched door inwards.  Walt
      notices the splintered door frame, and draws his weapon.

      Walt tries the light switch, but the power's dead, so he

      It's freshly spilled blood.

      stands, instinctively tracking the footstep trajectory across
      the street.  He freezes, looking up; his expression fraught

      steps out into the open as he controls a squirming J.J. with
      one arm, his left hand covering his mouth.  In his right

                    even put up a fight.

      Cabot raises his gun at Randy, as J.J. suddenly bites Cabot's
      hand; hard.  He screams, releasing the boy immediately. 
      Johnny immediately rushes forward, driving his shoulder into
      Cabot's chest and powering him back at full force into the
      wall, Cabot's head striking a heavy wooden shelf...

      Cabot goes down hard, his pistol skittering across the floor.

      J.J. and Randy don't need to be told twice.  They take off. 

      Johnny sees the gun and starts for it as Zed suddenly appears
      from across the kitchen and FIRES several shots, missing
      Johnny and ripping holes into the refrigerator.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Everybody upstairs!  Now!

      Johnny helps Randy scramble up the stairs.

      ANOTHER ANGLE - STAIRCASE

      As Johnny and Randy reach the top of the stairs, Zed appears
      at the bottom and FIRES SEVERAL SHOTS, missing their target
      by inches.  He then barrels up the steps after them.


3939INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Our guys fly into the room, as Johnny slams the door shut
      behind them, locking it.

      They retract into a far corner, staring at the...

      DOOR

      The knob twists several times, then stops.  A beat of eerie
      silence.  Calm before the storm.

      BAM!  The door bucks violently.  BAM!  Another powerful blow
      from the outside.

      BACK TO THE CAPTIVES

      the boys cowering.  Johnny does his best to comfort them.

                                      JOHNNY
                    They can't get in.  That door is
                    made of solid oak.

                                      RANDY
                    The hinges aren't.

      Johnny's expression tightens; the kid is right.  Shifting
      his attention back to the door...


                                                                (CONTINUED)                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT TWO - 8/29/05 - PINK   23.

      THE DOOR HINGES

      brass fixtures secured with four small screws, straining
      with every brute force assault.  They flex at the strain,
      ready to give at any second.

                                    ZED (O.S. THROUGH DOOR)
                    Open the door and we won't hurt you!

                                      RANDY
                    Screw you!

                                    ZED (O.S. THROUGH DOOR)
                    Have it your way!

      BOOM!  BOOM!  As the big man begins to power kick the door
      again.

      JOHNNY

      jams his body up against the door.  J.J. and Randy join him,
      offering whatever resistance they can muster.

      BAM!  Another powerful blow.  Then it all stops.  Silence.

                                      RANDY
                    Maybe they decided to give up.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I doubt it.

                                    J.J.
                    What do they want?

                                      RANDY
                            (reflective)
                    Me.  They want... me.

      Johnny tries to regain the moment...

                                      JOHNNY
                    Listen, we're going to get out of
                    this.  All of us.  We just have to
                    stick together.  Right?

      J.J. nods, then Randy.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Okay.  Now, let's think...


4040EXT. SMITH HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - SAME TIME - ON WALT

      flashlight in hand, sweeping the bullet riddled front door...
      Walt decides to go around back.                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT TWO - 8/29/05 - PINK   24.



40A40AEXT. SMITH HOUSE - BACK DOOR

      Walt approaches the back door, redirecting his light to
      illuminate the busted door jamb; the forced point of entry.

      With his pistol drawn, he goes for the door...


4141INT. SMITH HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      Dead calm.  Walt inches his way in, gun poised for action. 
      Scouring the room with his flashlight...

      HIS P.O.V.

      as the circle of light dances across the walls; the coast
      seemingly clear.  He tries the light switch to no avail, 
      then notices an unsettling discovery... the track of Randy's
      blood, the open first aid kit, a pile of bloody bandages. 
      Then he sees the shot-up refrigerator door.

      BACK TO WALT

      he's seen more than enough.  His anxiety overwhelming as he
      TURNS and his flashlight beam FINDS Cabot's face.

                                    WALT
                    Don't you move or I'll shoot!

      Cabot slowly raises his hands.

                                      CABOT
                    Take it easy, officer.

                                    WALT
                    Put the gun down.  Now!

                                      CABOT
                    I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.

                                    WALT
                    Why not?

                                      CABOT
                    Because my partner'll have my ass.

                                    WALT
                    Partner?

      Before Walt can react, the butt of a pistol streaks through
      FRAME, connecting with base of Walt's skull.  THUNK!  He
      instantly drops, his flashlight rolls across the floor and
      stops, shining back on Walt's unconscious face.





                                                                (CONTINUED)                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT TWO - 8/29/05 - PINK   25.

      CABOT AND ZED

      Cabot steps up and points his gun at Walt's head preparing
      to fire, as Zed suddenly kicks it away.

                                      CABOT
                    What the hell?  You said no witnesses.

                                    ZED
                    I know.  But a cop might come in
                    handy later on.  Tie him up.

      Zed starts away as Cabot grabs him...

                                      CABOT
                    Where you goin'?

      Zed looks at the hand grabbing his arm...

                                    ZED
                    Don't ever touch me.

      Cabot can tell he's not kidding and releases his grip.

                                      CABOT
                    Fine.  Where are you going?

                                    ZED
                    To get my ax out of the van.
                          (looking up)
                    It's time to finish this thing.


4242INT. SMITH HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

      Randy is on the bed; he doesn't look good.  Johnny rewraps
      the leg wound. 

                                      RANDY
                    I can't keep my eyes open.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You've lost a lot of blood.

                                    J.J.
                    What about the window?  We can jump.

      Johnny's gaze shifts to the window; a flash of hope.

                                      JOHNNY
                    It's too high, but maybe we can call
                    for help.
                          (crossing he rubs
                            J.J.'s head)
                    Good job.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT TWO - 8/29/05 - PINK   26.

42CONTINUED:42

      But their triumph is short lived... Johnny tries the window;
      it's jammed.  Forcing it with all his strength.  It doesn't
      budge.  He turns back to the boys...

                                      JOHNNY
                    Security dead bolts are still engaged. 
                    Without power I can't get it open.

                                    J.J.
                    Can't we break it?

                                      JOHNNY
                      Reinforced glass.  Shatter resistant
                    and sound proof. 
                          (off J.J.'s look)
                    I figured it'd keep people out, not
                    us in.

      As his hand goes to close the wood shutter... WHOOSH! 

      As the room shifts, and Observer Johnny is looking out the
      same window, which is now open.


4343THROUGH THE GLASS - THE DRIVEWAY - VISION (1940'S)

      A group of random NEIGHBORS materialize in the front drive;
      dressed 1940's appropriate.  The mood tense, many toting
      makeshift weapons.  They confront Johnny's grandfather, John.

      NEW ANGLE - THE CROWD

      HARRIS KNOWLES (40) is in the front of the pack, the clear
      leader.  He shouts... 

                                      KNOWLES
                    We know they're in there, Smith, and
                    we're not leaving without them!

      The crowd VERBALIZES its support.

                                      KNOWLES
                    Either you send those dirty Japs
                    out... or we're coming in to get
                    'em! 

      Someone hurls a bottle and rocks, shattering the window; the
      situation growing increasingly volatile.


43A43AINT. SMITH HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM

      The closed bedroom door bursts open, as Young Herb leads
      Koji and his MOTHER and FATHER in, locking the door behind
      them.  Koji and his parents huddle together; riddled with
      fear and desperation.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT TWO - 8/29/05 - PINK   27.

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    This way!  It's a secret way down to
                    the basement! 

      He crosses to the closet, yanking open a back panel to reveal
      a service DUMBWAITER.

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    Hurry, please.  My father will be
                    here any minute! 

      Observer Johnny takes it all in... WHOOSH!


4444BACK TO REALITY

      Johnny releases the window frame, crossing purposefully to
      the closet...

                                      JOHNNY
                    J.J., give me a hand.

      He throws open the closet door; it's packed with clothing
      and other assorted possessions.  He proceeds to empty it.

      J.J. joins in.  They clear a path, exposing the back wall;
      covered in wood panels.

      Suddenly, KABOOM!  As the ax smashes the bedroom door from
      outside.  Then again, as the razor sharp blade penetrates
      the door.  It won't be long until they're through.  

      Johnny looks around, then goes to the night stand and rips
      through the bottom drawer and draws out a claw hammer.  He
      hurries back and begins smashing at the wood.

                                      JOHNNY
                    It has to be here.

      Prying it back to reveal a section of dumbwaiter.  He quickly
      rips out the remaining boards.

                                    J.J.
                    What is it?

                                      JOHNNY
                    It's a dumbwaiter.  Like a mini
                    elevator.

                                    J.J.
                    How'd you know it was there?

                                      JOHNNY
                    My father showed me.

44CONTINUED:44

      KABOOM!  As the ax blade cuts deeper into the door again and
      again!

                                      JOHNNY
                    We don't have much time.


4545NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER

      Johnny helps a fading Randy into the cramped dumbwaiter. 
      J.J. crawls in behind him.  As he does, the antique Zippo
      lighter falls from his pocket; landing at Johnny's feet.

      Johnny picks it up.  His eyes meet J.J.'s.

                                      JOHNNY
                    We'll talk about this later.

                                    J.J.
                    What about you?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'll come down next.

      Johnny puts his hands on the control rope.

                                    J.J.
                    Johnny...
                          (beat)
                    Be careful.

      Johnny offers a reassuring smile as he slowly lowers the
      car, the precious cargo descending down the shaft, glancing
      back as Zed and Cabot are closer to smashing through the
      door.


4646DUMBWAITER - CONTINUOUS

      The boys take a jerky ride down the dark and musty shaft,
      the car eventually coming to rest.  J.J. hollers up... 

                                    J.J.
                    We're down!

                                      JOHNNY (O.S.)
                    Where does it come out?

      J.J. lifts door.  The exit has been covered. 

                                    J.J.
                    I can't tell!  It's boarded up!                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT TWO - 8/29/05 - PINK   29.

                    I can't!

                                      JOHNNY

      J.J. braces himself, mustering his strength and KICKS!


4949INT. SMITH HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

      A section of plaster wall explodes out, a child's sneaker
      sticking through.  Retracting a beat, followed by a tiny
      fist enlarging the opening.  J.J. pokes his head through,
      getting his bearings...

                                    J.J.
                    It's the basement!


5050MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS - JOHNNY

      Reacts, some good news for a change.  Calling down...

                                      JOHNNY
                    Help Randy out of the car and I'll
                    pull it back up!

      Zed and Cabot can nearly get their arm through to unlock the
      bedroom door.

                                    J.J. (O.S.)
                    Okay, go!

      Johnny pulls the dumbwaiter up with the rope.  BAM!  Johnny
      reacts...

      BEDROOM DOOR

      Zed reaches his arm in through the opening and unlocks the
      door, bursting in with fire in his eyes.  Scanning the room...
      no signs of life.

      He crosses to the CLOSED closet doors, and throws one OPEN...
      EMPTY.  Turning his back.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT TWO - 8/29/05 - PINK   30.

      The instant he does, Johnny throws OPEN the other door and
      drives the whittling knife down hard between the big man's
      shoulder blades.  Zed SCREAMS in intense pain, flailing wildly
      forward in an effort to dislodge the blade.

      Johnny jumps into the dumbwaiter, hastily lowering himself
      down; disappearing into the shaft.

      Cabot suddenly enters the bedroom, surveying the scene.  A
      grimacing Zed signals towards the closet...

                                    ZED
                    In the closet!

      Cabot quickly throws OPEN the closet door and grabs the
      lowering pulley rope...

                                      CABOT
                    Not so fast!

      Zed, having pulled the knife out, joins him as both men pull
      hard trying to raise the dumbwaiter.


5151DUMBWAITER

      Johnny's nearly down as he feels the resistance on the rope. 
      As he fights to keep the car moving.  As both men grab the
      rope at the same time... WHOOSH! 


5252INT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY - VISITATION ROOM - VISION

      Zed and Cabot sit in a corner cubicle, where Marcus Perez
      sits alone; wearing his prison jumpsuit.

                                    ZED
                    We found them.

                                      CABOT
                    He and his old man are stashed away
                    up in Maine.  

                                      PEREZ
                    Those two are the only things keeping
                    me in this rathole.  Without them,
                    the prosecution doesn't have a case
                    and I'm a free man.

                                    ZED
                    We'll take care of it.

                                      PEREZ
                    You better. 

      He leans closer; menacing eyes.  Cold and intense...

                    two won't.

      WHOOSH! 


5353RESUME ON JOHNNY

      in the dumbwaiter, struggling to lower himself down.  A losing
      battle, the car starts to ascend...


5454CLOSET

      The two men easily pulling Johnny up.


5555DUMBWAITER

      Johnny has only seconds to act.  He remembers and pulls the
      Zippo from his pocket.  Flicking it... nothing.  He tries
      again... it flickers weakly, then lights as Johnny holds the
      flame to the rope, burning through century-old fibers.

      The car continues to RISE, where a certain fate awaits Johnny.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Come on.  Burn!

      Just as they are about to reach down and grab Johnny, the
      rope finally burns through...


5656NEW ANGLE

      As the dumbwaiter drops away down the shaft in free fall,
      crashing violently at the bottom.

      A powerful explosion of dust and debris explodes from the
      fresh opening...

                                    J.J.
                    Johnny?

      As he finds Johnny lying injured; beaten and battered amongst
      the debris...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


5858INT. SMITH HOUSE - BASEMENT - EVENING

      J.J. digs through the debris, finally unearthing Johnny.  He
      is covered in dust and dirt, his arm injured and his head is
      bleeding down his forehead as he stirs...

                                    J.J.
                    Are you okay?

      Johnny does what every good father would do, he lies.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Yeah.  Let's do it again.

      J.J. smiles; an instant of much-needed levity.  As he turns,
      we see Johnny wince and hold his left side as he's helped
      out of the opening.

                                      RANDY
                    That was close. 

                                      JOHNNY
                    Too close.  They busted through that
                    door just as...
                          (turns)
                    The door!

      He staggers across the debris, crossing the basement...


5959FOYER - SAME TIME

      Zed and Cabot running down the stairs...

                                    ZED
                    Basement!  Hurry!


6060BASEMENT - SECONDS LATER

      Johnny reaches the heavy basement door; it's OPEN.

      HIS P.O.V. ZED AND CABOT

      Zed and Cabot come charging down the stairs.

                                    ZED
                    I'm gonna shoot you in the face!

                                      JOHNNY
                    Not tonight you're not!

      JOHNNY

      slams the door shut at the very last second, securing the
      deadbolt and cross brace.


6161OUTSIDE THE BASEMENT DOOR

      Zed reaches the closed door, his frustration finally bubbling
      to the surface.  He smashes his fist into the heavy wood...

                                    ZED
                      Son-of-a... I'm gonna kill every one
                    of ya!  Y'hear me?!  Everyone!

      Zed starts back up the stairs...

                                      CABOT
                    What now?

                                    ZED
                    Now we talk to the cop.

                                                   HARD CUT TO:


6262WALT

      Tied to a chair as he's punched hard in the face by Cabot,
      who flinches and grabs his hand. 

                                      CABOT
                    Damn!  This cop's got a hard head! 
                    I need a drink.

      Cabot steps away.  From the looks of Walt's face, they've
      been beating on him for a while.  Zed grabs him by the hair.

                                    ZED
                    Hick Sheriff, that what you are?  A
                    hick sheriff?

                                    WALT
                          (spits blood)
                    Go to hell.

                                    ZED
                    And I was just startin' to like you.

      Zed punches Walt again in the face.

                                    ZED
                          (flexing his hand)
                    Cabot's right, you have got a hard
                    head.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT THREE - 8/29/05 - PINK   34.

62CONTINUED:62

      He grabs a dining chair, spins it around backwards a few
      feet away from Walt.

                                    ZED
                    The question is what were you doin'
                    sneakin' around this house in the
                    dark?

                                      CABOT (O.S.)
                    This is why.

      REVEAL CABOT

      As he steps in holding a framed photograph, which he hands
      to Zed.

      INSERT - PHOTOGRAPH

      Walt, Sarah, J.J., and Johnny; a banner behind them reads,
      FATHER/SON OLYMPICS.

      ZED

      studies the faces.  A twisted smile easing across his lips.

                                    ZED
                          (looking up)
                    Maybe we shouldn't call him Sheriff...
                    maybe we should call him Dad?

      Zed inspects a wall-mounted INTERCOM unit.

                                    ZED
                          (to Cabot)
                    Get my tool box.  I need to have a
                    talk with that one in the basement.

                                      CABOT
                    Through that thing?  The power's
                    dead.

                                    ZED
                    I know, I'm the one who killed it. 
                    And now I'm going to turn it back
                    on... part of it anyway.

      Off the moment...

      Johnny tries to revive Randy...

                                      JOHNNY

      A tense beat.

                                    J.J.
                    Is he... dead?

      Another excruciating beat; a virtual eternity.  Randy's eyes
      slowly ease open.  

                                      RANDY
                          (weak)
                    I miss anything?

      Johnny and J.J. both breathe a sigh of relief.  But the moment
      fades fast as they HEAR Zed's VOICE suddenly crackle through
      the wall-mounted intercom unit.

                                    ZED (V.O. OVER INTERCOM)
                    Can you people hear me down there?


6464ON ZED AND WALT

      Zed has finished his jerry-rig on the intercom unit, which
      now hangs out of the wall by multiple wires and connected to
      a 16-volt battery.  We suddenly HEAR Johnny's VOICE crackle
      through the intercom speaker...

                                      JOHNNY (V.O. OVER INTERCOM)
                    We can hear you!  What do you want?

      Cabot seems very impressed by Zed's hot-wired communication
      device.

                                      CABOT
                    Damn.  You're like that guy on T.V. 
                    Mister Wizard!

      Zed clearly has no patience for his partner.

                                    ZED
                    Bring me the cop.

      Cabot frowns as he grabs Walt out of his chair and hustles
      him to where Zed is standing.  Zed cues the TALK button then
      speaks into the unit.

                                    ZED
                    I've got somebody here that wants to
                    say hello.
                          (aside to Walt)
                    If you want this to end without your
                    kid getting killed, I suggest you
                    convince your friend to do the right
                    thing.

      He then cues the Talk button again and holds the speaker up
      for Walt to speak into it.  Walt hesitates as he eyes his
      two captors and considers what's at stake.  Finally,

                                    WALT
                          (pretty beat up)
                    John, it's Walt.  No matter what
                    they do to me... stay where you are!

      J.J. reacts to the voice...

                    They've got me hand-cuffed upstairs.

                                    J.J.
                    Dad?

      Johnny grabs him and holds him tight.

                                    WALT (V.O. OVER INTERCOM)
                    John... NO MATTER WHAT YOU HEAR, DO
                    NOT OPEN THAT DOOR!

      As Walt continues...

                    YOU HEAR ME?  DO NOT...

      That's all Walt can get out before he's drilled in the face
      again by Zed's fist.

                                    ZED
                    That was really stupid.

      Zed cues the Talk button again:

                                    ZED
                          (into intercom unit)

      Zed pops a cigarette into his mouth, lighting up.  Taking a

      Johnny paces, as he notices J.J. in the corner; crying.  He
      notices the old steamer trunk he had J.J. drag down from the
      attic and retrieves an old tweed top coat.  He crosses to
      J.J., wrapping the coat around him for warmth. 

                                    J.J.

6969INT. SMITH HOUSE - OFFICE - VISION

      John Smith is seated in a chair.  Young Herb stands at his
      side.

                                    JOHN SMITH
                    How dare you bring those people into*
                    our home?  Force me to lie to my*
                    friends.  My neighbors. *

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    Koji and his parents had nowhere*
                    else to go.

                                    JOHN SMITH
                    Don't you understand?  Our family
                    name will be ruined.  My business
                      destroyed. 

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    For doing what's right?  Isn't that
                    what you always taught me?    

      John Smith rises, placing a comforting hand on young Herb's
      shoulder.  Observer Johnny takes it in, moved by the noble
      exchange.  WHOOSH!                 DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT THREE - 8/29/05 - PINK   39.



7070RESUME SCENE - BASEMENT - ON JOHNNY

      as a loud THUD draws his attention back across the room as
      we SEE Randy has collapsed on his way towards the basement
      door.  Johnny and J.J. quickly cross to where he's lying.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What are you doing?

                                      RANDY
                    This isn't about you, it's my problem. 
                    Let me go.

      Johnny realizes he's being guided and protected by the spirits
      in the house.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Nobody's going anywhere.  We're in
                    this thing together, right?

      J.J. considers the question, then...

                                    J.J.
                    Right.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Come on.

      Johnny helps Randy back to the couch, then turns and stares
      at J.J.

                                      JOHNNY
                    We've got water and plenty of air...
                          (suddenly struck with
                          an idea)
                    Air.  That's it.

      Johnny climbs up a stack of boxes; yanking away some junk
      that's covering a large air vent.

                                      JOHNNY
                    These air ducts are original design
                    and they crisscross the entire house. 
                    They're bigger than modern vents.  I
                    might be able to crawl through them
                    and find Walt.

      J.J. looks down, nervous...

                                      JOHNNY
                    What's wrong?

                                    J.J.
                    What if they catch you?  Then I'll
                    lose both my fathers.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT THREE - 8/29/05 - PINK   40.

      Johnny grabs him gently by the shoulders.

                                      JOHNNY
                    They won't catch me.  Haven't you
                    ever seen 'DIE HARD'?  If Bruce Willis
                    can do it, so can I.  Come on, help
                    me get this grate off.

      As they both go to work,


7171INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

      Zed inspects the contents of Johnny's refrigerator.  Cabot
      paces impatiently; a ball of energy.  A bloodied, battered
      Walt tracks him with his swollen eyes, utter disdain. 

                                      CABOT
                    How much longer are we gonna play
                    games?

                                    ZED
                          (checks his watch)
                    They still have four minutes.

      Cabot points his pistol at Walt's face.

                                      CABOT
                    Then you're mine, law dog.

                                    ZED
                    I'm gonna' go check the garage. 
                    Don't do anything until I get back.

                                      CABOT
                    Whatever.

                                    ZED
                    I'm serious.  It's just as easy to
                    kill six as it is five.

      Cabot glares at Zed as he exits.


7272INT. SMITH HOUSE - BASEMENT - SAME TIME

      Johnny stands below the open grate; last-second preparations
      with J.J.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Okay, you know what to do.  One
                    hundred Mississippi and then you
                    open that door.  Not one Mississippi
                    before.

      J.J. nods.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT THREE - 8/29/05 - PINK   41.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Where's your wrench?

      J.J. lifts a giant plumbers wrench from behind his back. 
      Johnny grabs a can of Quick Fix lubricant and heads into the
      vent.

                                    J.J.
                    Good luck.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You, too.

      Johnny smiles back, then slips into the vent.


7373INT. VENTILATION DUCT - CONTINUOUS

      A long metallic tunnel.  Labored GRUNTS precede Johnny's
      appearance around a corner.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (muttering to himself)
                    Next time the kid wants to go bowling,
                    just go bowling!  No, you've gotta
                    play Mister Mom and punish the kid. 
                    Now who's getting punished?  You're
                    a real genius!

      He turns left, squeezing himself around the elbow.


7474KITCHEN - SAME TIME - ON WALT

      His face swollen and cut from the beating, the area around
      his eyes already discolored; it's painful to look at him.

      Cabot is busy making himself a sandwich, as Walt HEARS a
      muted TAPPING that draws his gaze upwards...

      HIS P.O.V. - THE VENTILATION GRATE

      Johnny's EYES are just barely visible just behind the metal.

      BACK TO WALT

      his eyes drift over to Cabot.  Suddenly a loud BANG from
      another room.  BANG!  BANG!

                                      CABOT
                    What the hell... ?                DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT THREE - 8/29/05 - PINK   42.



7575BASEMENT - SAME TIME

      J.J. is at a thick vertical pipe wailing on it with the
      plumbers wrench.  BANG!  BANG!


7676KITCHEN - SAME TIME

      BANG!  BANG!  Cabot checks Walt for a beat, then exits to
        investigate.  As soon as he's gone, Johnny pops the grating
      vent and lowers himself out.  He grimaces, his left arm
      clearly injured.  Checking around, he rushes to Walt and
      removes the gag.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (seeing Walt's face)
                    My God.

                                    WALT
                    You should see the other guy.

      Johnny goes to work untying him.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Sorry I'm late.  Traffic was a bitch.

                                    WALT
                    J.J.?

                                      JOHNNY
                    He's fine.

                                    WALT
                    I screwed up, John.  Rushing in here
                    by myself.  I just had this horrible
                      feeling...

      Johnny gets the final rope undone.

                                      JOHNNY
                    It's called being a father.  I
                    would've done the same thing.

      Cabot steps up from behind.

                                      CABOT
                    I'm touched.

      Johnny remains kneeling, his back to Cabot.

                                      CABOT
                    Stand up.  Slow.
                          (Johnny obliges)
                    Turn around.



                                                                (CONTINUED)                DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT THREE - 8/29/05 - PINK   43.

76CONTINUED:76

      Johnny slowly turns around to face him, now less than ten
      feet apart.  Cabot looks Johnny up and down.

                                      CABOT
                    You're the guy causin' so much
                    trouble?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'm the guy.

                                      CABOT
                    Don't look like much to me.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Maybe you aren't looking close enough.

      Johnny suddenly raises both hands, one holding the Zippo
      lighter and the other the full can of Quick Fix.  Before
      Cabot can react, Johnny sprays the Quick Fix and strikes the
      lighter just beneath the stream as a powerful fireball engulfs
      Cabot's face.  His hands go up as he SCREAMS IN PAIN!

      Johnny quickly helps Walt out of the chair and they scramble
      out of the room.

      Zed quickly enters from the other direction.

                                    ZED
                    What happened?

                                      CABOT
                          (clutching his face
                          in agony)
                    The guy in the basement... he burned
                    my eyes... I can't see!

                                    ZED
                    Idiot.

      Zed pulls out his gun and goes after them.

      Johnny and Walt rumble down the steps to the door and begin

      Johnny looks back as Zed rounds the corner, powering down
      towards them; raising his pistol to fire.

                                      JOHNNY

      He opens the door, as Johnny and Walt explode through just
      as bullets WHIZ by, slicing into the plaster behind them. 
      Once again, the door is slammed in Zed's face.

      ON ZED

      He's had all he's going to take as he kicks the door hard.

      We PASS THROUGH the door to FIND Zed standing on the other

                    You wanna' play games?  Let's play! 

      He douses the door with gasoline.  He steps up on the third
      step, lights a cigarette, takes a drag then flicks it...

      SLOW MOTION: The lit cigarette tumbles through the air and
      it hits the gas soaked door as it EXPLODES INTO FLAMES! 
      WHOOSH!

      As a massive fireball shoots out from under the jam and around
      the frame.  The door is instantly engulfed in flame.

      FADE IN:


8585INT. SMITH HOUSE - BASEMENT - EVENING

      The door continues to BURN, sending smoke into the basement. 
      Johnny tries smashing out the small window, but the wrench
      bounces off the reinforced glass.

                                      JOHNNY
                    It's no use.

      Walt notices Randy lying on the couch, unconscious.

                                    WALT
                    That's the kid that witnessed the
                    Perez murder?

                    Perez?

                                    WALT
                    Big time drug dealer in Nevada. 
                    Killed a local businessman over a
                    land deal.  They put him away for
                    life, but he just got a new trial
                    granted.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That's why they killed Randy's father.

                                    WALT
                    Without their testimony, Perez walks.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That's why you were in the

                    The Feds got tipped about the

                    I could bring in the father and son
                    until they got here.  Bang up job I

8686OUTSIDE THE BURNING DOOR - SAME TIME

      Zed stares at the flames.  Cabot stumbles in behind him;
      blinded.

                                      CABOT
                    You gotta' get me to a doctor!

      Zed doesn't acknowledge him; gaze fixed on the door.

                                    ZED
                    Later.

                                      CABOT
                          (losing it)
                    You're not hearin' me!  I'm blind!

      He grabs Zed, who pins him hard against the wall.

                                      CABOT
                    I can't do this anymore!

                                    ZED
                    Fine.

      As Zed SHOOTS his partner in the gut at point blank range. 
      Cabot GASPS, then drops to the floor.

                                    ZED
                          (intense)
                    I told you not to touch me.


8787INT. BASEMENT - SAME TIME

      Johnny rummages through the trunk of his grandfather's
      belongings, touching everything; searching desperately for a
      psychic hit.  He finds a rusty skeleton key... WHOOSH! 


8888MOVE, MATCH, MORPH

      Swinging around the basement as it resets, sixty years in
      the past.

      Koji's frightened PARENTS are huddled in a corner.  The angry
      CHANTING of the mob audible even down here.  REVEAL Young
      Herb and Koji nearby...

                                    KOJI
                    Why do they hate us so much?  What
                    did we do wrong?

      Young Herb takes a beat to consider the question. 



                                                                (CONTINUED)                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT FOUR - 8/29/05 - PINK   48.

88CONTINUED:88

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    I think they're afraid and angry. 
                    They just want someone to blame. 
                    Someone who looks different than
                    they do.

      Koji shakes his head in confusion.

                                    KOJI
                    Grown-ups do crazy things sometimes. 

      They share a knowing smile.  Sudden FOOTSTEPS on the basement
      stairs draw their frightened attention, as the DOOR swings
      OPEN to REVEAL John Smith; sporting a severe scowl.

      Koji scurries into his parents' arms.  The family huddles
      closely together; petrified.

      Young Herb meets his father's eyes.  A beat of silence between
      them.  An unspoken understanding.  Herb turns to the family... 

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    Don't be afraid, my father's here to
                    help.

      John Smith retrieves a shiny new skeleton key from his breast
      pocket and crosses to a brick wall.  Removing a loose brick
      to reveal a concealed key hole.  Observer Johnny watches
      intently.

      A turn of the key and a hidden door reveals itself.  John
      Smith pulls it open, exposing a tunnel. 

                                    JOHN SMITH
                    This tunnel was built during the
                      Prohibition.  To smuggle illegal
                    whiskey.  It'll take you out to the
                    woods.  You'll find a car waiting
                    there.

      He pulls a wad of money from a pocket and offers it to Koji's
      father.

                                    JOHN SMITH
                    This should buy you safe passage to
                    anywhere you want to go.

      Young Herb hands the Mother a full canvas bag. 

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    Food and water.  Enough for three
                    days. 

      The Japanese man shares a concerned look with his wife.  He
      seems prideful and reluctant to take the money.

88CONTINUED: (2)88

      Finally, John Smith forces it into his hand.

                                    JOHN SMITH
                    I'm not a righteous man.  If it'd
                    been up to me, I'd have handed you
                    over and never looked back.
                          (looks at Young Herb)
                    I guess we don't always teach our
                      children... sometimes they teach us. 

      Koji's father locks eyes with him, formally bowing his
      gratitude; tremendous respect. Young Herb and Koji share a
      tortured look, then a hug...

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    Good-bye Koji.

                                    KOJI
                    Good-bye.

      The family heads for the opening of the tunnel...

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    Koji? 

      The boy turns.

                                      YOUNG HERB
                    Best friends forever.

      Koji hesitates, then stiffens and bows towards his friend
      and then they're gone.  WHOOSH! 


8989RESUME SCENE - ON JOHNNY

      Yanked from the vision; Johnny crosses the basement to a
      bank of metal shelving units covering the wall.  Smoke now
      fills the basement.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Give me a hand!

      Walt helps him yank down the shelving, exposing the now
      familiar brick wall.  Johnny finds the right brick, slides
      it out and uses to the key to open the secret tunnel.

                                    WALT
                    I'll be damned.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Everybody in!  Hurry!

      Walt hoists the barely conscious Randy over his shoulder,
      following J.J. into the tunnel.  Everyone is COUGHING.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT FOUR - 8/29/05 - PINK   50.

89CONTINUED:89

      Johnny takes a last glance back, just as the burning door
      BURSTS OPEN; Zed appearing through the smoke and fire.  Their
      eyes meet, as Johnny disappears into the tunnel.  Zed cowers
      away from the flames, as he jumps through the opening in
      pursuit...


9090INT. PROHIBITION TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

      Walt, Randy and J.J. lead the way through the dark tunnel. 
      Johnny brings up the rear...

      ZED

      Closing the gap.

      WALT, RANDY AND J.J.

      They reach the end of the tunnel, a ladder leading up to a
      grate; the moon visible above. 

      Walt climbs up first, powering the heavy iron grate open.

                                    WALT
                    J.J., you're first!

      J.J. scrambles up the ladder.

                                    WALT
                    Run into the woods, we'll be right
                    behind you.

      J.J. takes off, as Walt goes down and helps Randy up the
      ladder, Johnny arrives supporting him from behind.  It's
      slow going, the injured teen repeatedly losing his footing.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Just a few more feet.

      Walt reaches down, grabs Randy's jacket and pulls him up the
      final few feet to the surface.  Walt looks down the hole at
      Johnny.

                                    WALT
                    Gimme your hand!

      Johnny starts up the ladder, as a bullet suddenly RIPS into
      the rocky wall just above his head, driving him down the
      ladder as Zed quickly approaches...

                                      JOHNNY
                          (up at Walt)
                    Go!  Take the boys and get out of
                    here!

                    John...

      Another bullet EXPLODES above Johnny's head, as he ducks
      down...

                                      JOHNNY
                          (pointed)
                    Get J.J. out of here!  Now!

      Walt knows he's right, as Walt grabs Randy and takes off. 
      Johnny starts up the ladder again, as Zed appears from the
      darkness behind him.

      INCLUDE ZED

      He levels the gun at Johnny, now a mere fifteen feet behind
      him in the tunnel.

                                    ZED
                    End'a the line, mister!

                                      JOHNNY
                    Seems that way.

                                    ZED
                    This is for my partner.

      He squeezes the trigger, but the gun goes CLICK!  CLICK! 
      CLICK!  As both men realize he's out of ammunition.

      Johnny takes the opportunity to scramble up the ladder, as
      Zed tosses his gun and rushes forward, grabbing Johnny's
      ankle.  There's a brief struggle, as Johnny loses his grip
      and both men crash down off the ladder with a powerful THUD! 
      There's a scramble, a few PUNCHES are thrown, as Zed
      overpowers Johnny and knocks him down on his back with a
      powerful right hand.  The night has taken its toll on Johnny,
      his injured left arm, lacerated head and, now, bloody nose.

      Johnny lies groggy on the stone floor, as Zed notices a large
      rock and picks it up with both hands.  He steps up over
      Johnny, who is now helpless to stop him.

                                    ZED
                    You should have sent the kid out
                    when you had the chance.

                                      JOHNNY
                      I couldn't.

                                    ZED
                    Why not?

                    It isn't in my blood.

      Zed raises the rock and is about to smash Johnny's skull, as
      we HEAR a single GUN SHOT!  Zed drops the rock and falls
      face down next to Johnny, as several men in suits step out
      of the darkness, they carry guns and a certain air of
      efficiency about them.

                                      JOHNNY
                    We won't see him again?

                                      MARSHAL CONNORS*
                    I'm afraid not.  It's in his best
                    interest.  Gentlemen.

      Connors climbs into Randy's ambulance and it speeds away.*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Why do I get the feeling that none
                    of this is in that kid's 'best
                      interest'?

                                    WALT
                    I still can't figure out how we got
                    out of this in one piece.

      Johnny's gaze drifts across the porch, as WHOOSH!

      He SEES YOUNG HERB and JOHN SMITH standing together.


9393RESUME JOHNNY, WALT AND J.J.

      Johnny can't help but smile.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I think we had a little help from
                    the past.

      Walt and J.J. aren't sure what he's talking about, as the
      SHOT PULLS WIDE to include them all.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            THE END
