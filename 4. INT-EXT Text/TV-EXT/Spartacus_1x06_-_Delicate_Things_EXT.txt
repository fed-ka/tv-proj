  THUNDER BOOMS. RAIN pours from a swirl of DARK CLOUDS. [The 
  rain will be ever present throughout the episode unless 
  otherwise noted.]

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                      We have seen misfortune. We have 
                        felt the sting of defeat. The 
                        humility of vacant purse and empty 
                        stomach.

  Follow the rain down to THE BALCONY, where BATIATUS stands 
  proudly besides SPARTACUS, along with LUCRETIA and NAEVIA. 
  DOCTORE and the GLADIATORS are gathered below in the square, 
  including VARRO, BARCA, GNAEUS, HAMILCAR, RHASKOS, and 
  ASHUR.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Some believed the House of Batiatus 
                        would never reclaim its former 
                        glory. That we would fade from 
                        memory, forsaken by history. But we 
                        have proved them wrong. We have 
                        proved that the name Batiatus will 
                        live long after we have gone to 
                        dust and bone. Stand proud before 
                        the Bringer of Rain! The Slayer of 
                        the Shadow of Death! The new 
                        Champion of Capua! Spartacus!

  Batiatus throws Spartacus  hand up in victory. Varro and the 
  Gladiators go nuts, chanting his name. Ashur doesn t join 
  in, the bet he lost to Barca weighing heavy on him.

                                          GLADIATORS
                        Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus...

  Doctore beams, as does Batiatus. Lucretia musters a weak 
  smile, not liking Spartacus being anointed with Crixus  
  title of Champion of Capua.



                                          GLADIATORS
                        Spartacus! Spartacus!

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus! A titan, his victory 
                        eclipsing all others! Quenching our 
                        thirst! Fulfilling our hopes and 
                          dreams!Behold the man, as he 
                        becomes legend!

  The men ROAR. OFF Spartacus, not sure what to make of his 
  new-found fame...



  LIGHTNING FLASHES across the stormy skies. Spartacus steps 
  into FRAME. He stands at the cliff, looking out across the 
  rain-soaked horizon as the sun rises. SURA S BINDING is in 
  his hand, absently considered between his fingers.

                                        VARRO (O.S.)
                        How will you save us?

  Spartacus glances over as Varro joins him.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    12.

                                        VARRO
                        From the rain. Your victory splits 
                        the skies. How will you close them 
                        before we all drown?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You believe the rest of the fools, 
                        then? That I am blessed by the 
                        gods?

                                        VARRO
                        Miracles do take habit of shooting 
                        out of your ass.

  Spartacus can t help but smile. Varro joins him, looking out 
  across mountains.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        I ve heard whispers of yet more 
                        divine providence. Your wife. Is it 
                        true?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        She speeds to my arms from 
                        Neapolis.

  Varro beams, the news warming his heart.

                                        VARRO
                        And still you doubt the gods favor 
                        you.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      If what Sura has been forced to 
                        endure is parcel of their favor, I 
                        would rather they turn their back 
                      to me. If they exist at all.

                                        VARRO
                        She comes. That is all that matters 
                        now.

  Spartacus nods, something beyond her arrival weighing heavy 
  as his eyes settle back on the horizon.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You once lived free in these lands. 
                        From which way does she travel?

                                        VARRO
                                  pointing)(
                        The port in Neapolis lies in that 
                        direction.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    13.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Are there roads to the mountains 
                        that head east?

                                        VARRO
                        Several.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Which are the most sparsely 
                        traveled?

  Varro eyes Spartacus, suspicion rising.

                                        VARRO
                      An odd question, removed from the 
                        subject.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Not so far astray.

                                        VARRO
                                  lowered voice)(
                        Yes, some are sparsely traveled. 
                        But not to the point of the new 
                        Champion of Fucking Capua going 
                        unnoticed, if overcome by 
                        questionable thoughts.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        How long before you think Batiatus 
                        would allow me to buy our freedom? 
                        How many years would she be 
                        condemned to bow and scrape?

                                        VARRO
                      Is death the alternative? Move to 
                        escape these walls, and that is all 
                        you will find.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Has no one ever attempted such a 
                        thing?

                                        VARRO
                        And lived? No. It is a thing born 
                      of the impossible.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The same was said of defeating 
                        Theokoles.

  Varro considers that with a frown.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.

                        One begins to take shape...

  The background SHIFTS behind Spartacus, becoming a 
    slaughterhouse of violence as we TRANSITION TO --



  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES as Spartacus slaughters his way 
  through GUARDS, his sword spraying BLOOD and severing LIMBS. 
  SURA struggles with a Guard across the square by the front 
  gate, a KNIFE to her THROAT.

  A BURLY GUARD

  intercepts Spartacus, who slices him open in a GEYSER OF 
  BLOOD.  BURLY GUARD falls, DEAD.  Spartacus rears back and

  HURLS HIS SWORD

  at the Guard holding Sura. The blade SLAMS INTO THE GUARD S 
  FACE, freeing Sura. She yanks the gory sword free and hacks 
  and slashes the few remaining Guards that rush in.

  SPARTACUS

  surges forward, helping her. The last man falls, joining 
  dozens of bodies littering the square. Blood-splattered from 
  the battle, Spartacus and Sura embrace, their lips finding 
  each other s at last.

                                        VARRO (V.O.)
                        That s your plan?



  RESUME Spartacus and Varro.

                        I fear it malformed.

                      In what way?

                        Weapons, to begin.

                        Yet kept by lock and key. You 
                        believe the gods will drop one from 
                        the sky along with the rain?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I believe in opportunity. And the 
                        power of reason to seize upon it.

                                        VARRO
                        Fair enough. Say you somehow 
                         reason  up a weapon. What of a 
                        horse? You ll never reach the

  Spartacus smiles grimly, the background once again shifting 
  to --



  A bloodied Spartacus sits astride a HORSE recently liberated 
  from a SLAVE CART by the front gate. He reaches down and 
  grabs Sura s hand, swinging her up behind him. He yanks the 
  reins, the horse WIPING US TO --

  The Burly Guard intercepts Spartacus, who slices him open in 
  a GEYSER OF BLOOD.  Burly Guard falls, DEAD.  Spartacus 
  rears back to hurl his sword at the Guard holding Sura, but

  A WHIP LASHES

  around his wrist and YANKS him back, off his feet.  Reveal 
  Doctore in all his low-angle, escape-foiling glory.  He 
  glares down as Guards descend on Spartacus with their 
  swords. BLOOD SPRAYS.  Spartacus lives just long enough to 
  see --

  SURA S THROAT SLIT

  by the Guard holding her.  Blood and tears flow.  Her dead 
  body falls out of FRAME, WIPING US TO --



  Spartacus considers the outcome with a heavy heart, his eyes 
  glancing behind him to find Doctore consulting with two 
  GUARDS across the square.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I had not considered him.

                        You have not considered many 
                        things. Take pause, I beg of you.

  A beat as Spartacus struggles with alternate possibilities, 
  finds none.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        No. We will have our freedom. I 
                        will hold her in my arms, and hear 
                        her speak my name.

                      Is there nothing I can say to turn 
                        you from this path?

                        Then may the gods you don t believe 
                      in favor you.

  Varro moves away.  OFF Spartacus, grimly realizing the 
  mounting impossibility of his task...



  Alive with the hustle and flow of commerce despite the 
  drizzle. A MERCHANT moves past with a push cart, passing a 
  small KNOT OF GAWKERS outside of an ARMORY STALL.

  Spartacus stands resplendent in a new breastplate, grieves, 
  and forearm guards, a gleaming sword gripped in each hand. 
  Batiatus takes him in with a smile, Doctore close by. Ashur 
  lurks further back.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A fine figure, is he not?

                                          DOCTORE
                        A god among men.

  Spartacus forces a smile, uncomfortable at being praised by 
  the men he may soon be forced to kill.

                                        BATIATUS
                        More magnificent armor I have never 
                        beheld.

  Sensing an opportunity, Spartacus shifts to Batiatus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      If you grant permission, I would 
                        wear it upon my wife s arrival.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A move to impress?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        She will marvel at the sight.                                                                                    18.



  On Spartacus as the Burly Guard's SWORD deflects off his 
  GLEAMING NEW BREASTPLATE.  He hacks the man with TWIN 
  SWORDS, blood splattering as he bellows in triumph.

                                                                    SMASH BACK TO:



  Batiatus laughs, unaware of Spartacus  true reason for the 
  request.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A man must appear his best in the 
                        eyes of love. You may wear it.  And 
                        I will even stand by your side to 
                        welcome her into your arms.  The 
                        swords, however...

                                          SPARTACUS
                        What need would I have of them?

  Spartacus hands the swords to Doctore, a brief flash of 
  reluctance clouding his face as he does.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS (O.S.)
                        Can it be?!

  Spartacus looks over to find a wet MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS and 
  his fourteen-year-old son NUMERIUS approaching. An ESCORT OF 
  GUARDS makes room, dispersing the Gawkers.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        The legend himself among us?!

                                        BATIATUS
                        Magistrate Calavius! Good fortune 
                      to find you here.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        The fortune is mine! My son 
                        Numerius cannot cease his talk of 
                        Spartacus and his victory over 
                        Theokoles. He demanded trip to 
                        market to claim something of Thrace 
                      to your man s honor.
                                to Numerius)(
                        Show him.

  Numerius steps forward, eyes wide with awe. He pulls a KNIFE 
  from his cumbersome, ornate BELT to show Spartacus. A thin 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

  guard.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A fine blade!

                                        NUMERIUS
                        The merchant said it was a 
                        warrior s weapon.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      As it well is. See these marks? 
                        Thracians notch their hilts. One 
                        for every kill.

  CLOSE ON: THE HILT, a dozen SLASHES carved in it.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        How many made to yours after 
                        slaying Theokoles? He must have 
                        been worth ten at least! If I could 
                        wield a sword half as well you...

  Spartacus glances at the knife, a thought quickly taking 
  hold.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Join us at my master s ludus. I 
                        will teach you the blow that 
                        brought death to the Shadow.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A splendid notion!

                        afternoon.

  Numerius beams.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Why make the boy suffer with 
                          anticipation? Join us presently.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Joy must be delayed in favor of 
                        sorrow. I attend to matters 
                        regarding my cousin s murder.

  Ashur perks up, listening intently.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

                        Good Ovidius. The heart constricts 
                      at the thought.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        And swells with the promise of 
                        vengeance. Numerius! Come!
                                to Batiatus)(
                        Your generous hospitality will be 
                        welcomed shortly.

  Batiatus bows slightly as the Magistrate heads off with his 
  excited son. Batiatus takes Spartacus in with pursed lips.

                                        BATIATUS
                      An invitation to school the 
                        Magistrate s son?

  Spartacus tenses. Is Batiatus on to him?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Apologies, if offered out of turn.

  Batiatus breaks into a huge grin.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Fuck apologies! Shrewd maneuvering, 
                      if ever I saw it! Jupiter s cock, I 
                        will make a Roman out of you yet!

  Spartacus musters an accepting grin. OFF his relief...



  Batiatus moves through the rain with Spartacus.  Ashur and 
  Doctore follow.  The crowd points and gawks at Spartacus as 
  he passes.

                                        BATIATUS
                        See how they look at you?  My 
                        father had many champions, but none 
                      to rival the great Spartacus!  You 
                        can almost smell the coins dropping 
                        into our purse.

  Doctore frowns at that base commercialism, unseen by 
  Batiatus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      If I may, what remains of my own 
                        coin, after Sura's transport?

                                        BATIATUS
                        You wish to buy something for your 
                        wife, to honor her arrival?  The 
                        wares in this market are for proper 
                        Romans.  They would not suit a 
                        slave.

  Spartacus tries not to bristle at that.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I ask not for her, but for the men.  
                        Wine and women, in celebration of 
                      my victory.

  Ashur perks up, wheels turning.

                        A noble gesture, to be much 
                        appreciated.

                        Marcellus is of sound choice 
                        towards the vice.  Shall I make 
                        arrangement?

  Batiatus hands him a small purse of coins.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  SOFT)(
                        See that there is ample remainder.

  Ashur nods with a grin and hobbles off. Follow him to

  THE STALL OF MARCELLUS,

  the man he accosted with Barca in episode 105. Marcellus 
  tenses at the sight of him.

                                          MARCELLUS
                        More threats then, is it?

                        No. Coin, to the purpose of wine 
                        and whores. Enough to wet tongue 
                        and cock of my master s men.

                        assistance with...

  OFF Ashur s obvious distress over his debt to Barca...



  CLOSE ON a CASK OF WINE as it s cracked open. Gladiators 
  fill their cups as the dark liquid spews. WHORES, both male 
  and female, mingle among the men, laughing and fucking in 
  the rain. Spartacus watches, detached. Varro slides up next 
  to him, surveying the debauchery.

                      in your joyous offerings...

  Spartacus follows Varro s eyes to Doctore, who passes by 
  into the ludus without drink or company.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.

  Spartacus moves off, gathering two cups of wine as he goes. 
  A clutch of Gladiators break into song in his honor.

  He passes Barca, who has Pietros in his lap. He holds a cup 
  to the boy s lip as he sings with the men. Pietros sputters, 
  laughing.

                                          PIETROS

  Barca pulls him into a hungry kiss. A SHADOW falls over 
  them. Two Guards from the villa loom.

                        Pietros. You are summoned.

  SLOW MOTION. A half-drunk Varro sits against a training 
  dummy. He locks eyes with Spartacus, questioning. Spartacus 
  turns away as he heads for his cell.



  Spartacus stands at the edge of the cliff, Sura s binding in 
  his hand. Varro joins him, severely hung over.

  Varro casts an eye across the square. Marcellus is heading 
  out with his prostitutes. A few Gladiators are passed out 
  here and there. And the Guards aren t at their usual posts. 
  Varro grunts.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                                        VARRO
                      No one in condition to halt a man 
                      of purpose.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Such by design.

                                        VARRO
                                  with a frown)(
                        Doctore is usually up before the 
                        sun, whip in hand.
                                  a beat)(
                        Will he ever rise again?

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He will. But not for many hours.

                                        VARRO
                        Your chances improve, then.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      To the point of certainty.

                                        VARRO
                        Nothing is ever so. Even if you 
                        ride beyond the gates, the guards 
                        will pursue.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        They will be commanded against such 
                        action.

                                        VARRO
                                  laughs)(
                        You really expect them to obey you?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        No. I expect them to obey their 
                        master...


    (FLASHFORWARD)

  SLOW MOTION.  GUARDS rush past the bloodied, dead bodies of 
  their comrades littering the square.  They suddenly halt at 
  the sight of Spartacus holding Numerius' Thracian knife to 
  Batiatus' throat.  Sura, bloodied and defiant with sword in 
  hand, is by her husband's side.  Batiatus screams out a slow 
  motion order, terrified (no sound).

                                        BATIATUS
                        Drop your fucking swords! Do it!

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

  The Guards comply. As their swords crash to the wet sand, we 
  FLASH BACK TO --



  Spartacus continues his explanation to Varro.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I will release him when we are in 
                        the cover of the mountains.

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        Spartacus!

  They turn, startled to find Batiatus looking down at them 
  from the BALCONY. But instead of retribution, they receive a 
  broad smile. He hasn t heard them.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Your wife s cart appears upon the 
                        road! I will join you presently!

  Batiatus turns and enters the Villa. Varro remembers to 
  breathe.

                                        VARRO
                        I urge you to reconsider one last 
                        time.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Sura will be free. In this life, or 
                        the one after, with her husband by 
                        her side.

                                        VARRO
                        May the gods see you both upon the 
                        plains of Thrace.

  They grip forearms in a manly goodbye. Spartacus heads for 
  his cell, WIPING US TO --



  Sura and Spartacus stand on the plains of Thrace, happy and 
  free. She touches his cheek with a smile. He takes her in 
  his arms to kiss her. Just before their lips meet, the SOUND 
  of a HORSE WHINNY interrupts, SMASHING US BACK TO --                                                                                    48.



  SLOW MOTION. Spartacus steps onto the sand, eyes sweeping 
  the square. The rain has paused. The sun breaks through the 
  parting clouds, illuminating a stand by the gate where a 
  small covered SLAVE CART has just arrived.

  BATIATUS,

  his back to Spartacus, speaks with the driver, blocking our 
  view of him. Lucretia stands nearby with Naevia.

  A FEW GUARDS

  stand sentry by the gate. In their hung-over state, they 
  will be no match for Spartacus.

  GNAEUS

  leans against a post, looking ill.  Ashur hobbles up to 
  witness the proceedings.

  VARRO

  watches nervously from the Mess Hall. He catches sight of 
  something, tenses. His eyes flick to Spartacus, subtly 
  alerting him to

  DOCTORE

  who is just coming out from the ludus. The big man does not 
  look well -- or very happy as his suspicious eyes fall on

  SPARTACUS,

  who tightens his jaw at the unexpected sight. He turns his 
  attention back to Batiatus, his pace quickening to reach the 
  man.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.
  CONTINUED:

  DOCTORE

  steps out onto the sand, moving to meet him, but Varro 
     accidentally  steps into his path, slowing him down. 
  Doctore shoves him out of the way, but the distraction 
  served its purpose.

  SPARTACUS

  reaches Batiatus, his hand slipping to his forearm guard to 
  retrieve the Thracian knife. But before he can pull it out 
  Batiatus turns, revealing

  THE DRIVER SOAKED IN BLOOD

  behind him. Something is terribly wrong. STAY IN SLOW MOTION 
  as Spartacus catches snippets of the driver s conversation 
  with Batiatus, reaching him as if from underwater.

                                        DRIVER
                        ...attacked on the road... they 
                        came out of nowhere...

  SOUND FALLS OUT as Spartacus  hand drops from the hidden 
  knife. He rushes past Batiatus to

  THE REAR OF THE CART

  where several dead SLAVES AND GUARDS lie inside. Spartacus  
  heart seizes as his eyes fall on A BLOODIED SURA,

  barely clinging to life, her throat cut.  Spartacus cradles 
  her in his arms, tears spilling down his cheeks.  She 
  reaches up and touches his cheek.  Unable to speak his name.  
  She smiles at the closeness of him as the life drains from 
  her eyes.  Her hand falls away, leaving Spartacus' cheek 
  smeared with blood.

  BATIATUS TURNS AWAY

  with Lucretia. A faint smile creases his lips.

                                        BATIATUS
                      My word is kept. They are reunited.

  Lucretia eyes him in surprise as she realizes he never 
  intended for Sura to arrive at the ludus alive. A smile of 
  her own builds as they disappear back into the ludus.






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

  WIDE ON THE TRAINING SQUARE

  as Spartacus cradles Sura s lifeless body in his arms. DARK 
  CLOUDS close the sky above, blotting out the sun and 
  plunging us into darkness.
