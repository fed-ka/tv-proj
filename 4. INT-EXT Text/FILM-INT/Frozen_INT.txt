Parker gets herself some hot chocolate in the distance while
X
Dan and Lynch pick at what's left of a pizza on the table in
front of them.
DAN
We gotta take a weekend trip up
R
North one of these days. Hit up
Killington or Okemo and really do
it up right.
LYNCH
A
Why don't we just do it over
Christmas. You and me.
DAN
Done. When I stayed with my cousin
out West two years ago it was like
M
the stuff you see in commercials.
We had to take like 3 lifts to get
to the top and it was powder as far
as you could see.
LYNCH
Well, speaking of good skiing...
it's been cool doing the bunny hill
D
all day but do you think we could
get one real run in before we leave
tonight?
Dan feels bad.
E
DAN
Dude, you didn't have to stay with
us. It's totally cool if you want
to go off for a few.
Parker is now walking back to their table behind Lynch and is
pretty much right on top of them.
LYNCH
No, it's fine. I'm just saying
let's step it up a notch at some
point. It's been cool watching
Parker fall on her ass all day but
I would like to actually ski at
some point.
18.
Parker feels horrible.
PARKER
You know, I've probably had enough
for today anyway. I can just stay
in the lodge if you guys want to go-
X
Now Lynch feels horrible.
LYNCH
-no, no, no that's not what I
meant. I didn't mean it like that.
R
Parker looks to Dan.
PARKER
I told you I didn't have to come.
A
LYNCH
Parker, I didn't not want you to
come.
Dan tries to help.
M
DAN
It was his idea that we invited you
in the first place.
LYNCH
Exactly. Remember? I was like
"Hey man, why doesn't Parker come
D
with us?" And you were like-
DAN
-I was like, "OK that would be
cool".
E
Parker isn't buying it.
She puts on a smile.
PARKER
It's OK, you guys. The last thing
a girl wants to do is intrude on
"guy time". I won't be offended.
I've got stuff I could do anyway.
(to Dan)
Actually, can I have the key? I
should check my messages.
19.
DAN
No. No locker key. I can tell you
right now that every message on
there is going to be from your Mom
giving you more aggravation about
whatever the hell.
X
Parker laughs.
PARKER
She does not.
R
Dan looks to Lynch.
DAN
Ready for this? Two nights ago we
were watching a movie and her Mom
A
kept calling and calling.
(to Parker)
And what did she want?
Parker laughs.
M
DAN (cont'd)
She wanted to know if we wanted to
have chicken soup or vegetable soup
with Christmas dinner. Christmas
dinner! Four weeks away, and she
had to now right then and there
what kind of soup we'd prefer.
D
LYNCH
What did you say?
You said
chicken.
DAN
E
Hell yes, I said chicken, but
that's not the point.
(to Parker)
The point is you can go a few more
hours without hearing from Annette.
Parker looks to Lynch.
PARKER
I'm sorry if I ruined skiing for
you today.
20.
LYNCH
You didn't! You didn't at all!
You missed the part before you
walked over here when I was all
like, "Dude, this has been so
cool...you know...doing..."
X
Parker and Dan are beaming at him.
He knows he's beat.
LYNCH (cont'd)
(frustrated)
What?

STEVE (the driver) concentrates on the path.
The roar of his
engine is almost deafening.
His radio chimes in.
VOICE (O.C.)
Steve.
Steve picks up his radio.
STEVE
Go for Steve.

VOICE (O.S.)
We got a problem here.

Steve listens.
VOICE (O.C.)
M
It's nothing but ice at the bottom
of Wildcat so you're gonna have to
cut over to the south hill and come
around the side.
STEVE
That's gonna take me 20 minutes!
D
VOICE (O.C.)
Sorry brother, but it's a frozen
swimming pool down here.
STEVE
E
10-4.
He puts the Snow Cat in gear and begins to back up.

Steve turns the headlights in the opposite direction, just
missing the helmet falling past his windshield.
M
Though we can briefly see the light shine off of the three
kids, unless you knew they were there or were looking for
them...you would have missed them, too.
As the windshield turns the other way, one of Lynch's skis
slams into the ground, just out of the headlight's view.

A DRIVER (male, 50's) is cautiously driving down the wet icy
road. He reaches down to adjust the radio.
He looks back up to reveal Parker's body in the road in front
of him.

The driver drives frantically, speaking into his cell phone.
DRIVER
(into phone)
I don't know. I found her laying
in the road alone. Looks like she
was in some sort of accident.
Right outside of Mount Holliston.
I'm taking her to you now.
