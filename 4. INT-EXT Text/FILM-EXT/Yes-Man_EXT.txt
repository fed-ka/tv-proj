It's New Year's Eve at Rudy's, a hole-in-the-wall dive.
People stream into the bar to celebrate. Outside, CARL
KENDALL (30s) and his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend KATH are
having a quiet intense discussion.
KATH
You don't do anything more. You
used to be fun. Now you hardly
ever even leave your apartment.
CARL
I'm here, aren't I?
KATH
That's because it's New Year's Eve.
You have to be here. Besides, it's
not only social stuff. You used to
have dreams. You wanted to go to
business school, you wanted to work
for the World Bank.
CARL
So I discovered b-school's not for
me. People grow.
KATH
Growing is "X is not for me so I'll
do Y." You went X is not for me
and so I guess I'll sit on the
couch for the rest of my life.
CARL
(ACQUIESCING)
Well, look, this sucks, but I
understand where you're coming
from.
KATH
This is the problem. You don't
even care that I'm breaking up with
you.
CARL
Of course I care.
But I also
understand.
KATH
You shouldn't just understand. You
should be mad. Or upset. Or sad.
Or something.
2.
CARL
We're at different places in our
lives. I get it.
KATH
Your girlfriend of two years breaks
up with you right before New Year's
Eve and all you can say is "I get
it?" It is completely within your
right to call me a bitch.
CARL
That would be inappropriate.
KATH
(tearing up)
I can't believe I've been dating
someone so emotionless.
CARL
C'mere.
It'll be OK.
Carl hugs her.
Carl walks down the street, fast. He passes a CUTE GIRL
who's name we'll learn is RENEE passing out flyers for a band
called "The Flying Buttresses."
4.
RENEE
Wanna rock out tonight?
CARL
I don't rock out.
He walks into Dunkin Donuts.
Carl ignores the girl handing out fliers.
8.
Carl's eating lunch at a picnic table outside. Several bank
employees smoke cigarettes near him. An oddly hyper guy
named ALEX approaches Carl.
ALEX
Carl Kendall?
CARL
Alex Eberts? What's up, buddy?
Alex hugs Carl.
ALEX
Too much! How've you been? I
can't believe you're still working
here.
CARL
Where've you been? Norman's been
heartbroken since you quit.
11.
ALEX
Where've I been? You mean, where
haven't I been? This year. Dude.
I have lived. I climbed Mt.
Kilmanjaro. I ate bat in Laos. I
shot a cow with a bazooka. I'm not
proud of that last one but I did
it. How's the bank?
CARL
Same old same old.
ALEX
See? That's the problem. That's
everyone's problem. You've got one
life. Why waste it on the same old
same old?
Alex hands Carl a pamphlet for a "Just Say Yes" seminar.
ALEX (cont'd)
I know this will sound queer, but
you have to hit this seminar. It
changed my life. It will change
yours. Unless you like the bank.
CARL
You kidding? Every day it's
impossible not to throw rocks at
the place.
(JOKING)
Since you don't work here anymore,
you want to throw a couple?
ALEX
Yes.
Alex starts WHIPPING rocks at the bank.
CARL
What're you doing!
Stop that!
I
was kidding!
Norman comes out.
NORMAN
What do you think you're doing?
(recognizing Alex)
Alex Eberts! Is this an alumnae
prank? I love pranks!
ALEX
Hey, Norman!
12.
Alex continues throwing rocks at the bank.
NORMAN
(into a walkie-talkie)
We have a situation.
A couple portly security guards come out and wrestle Alex to
the ground. He manages to escape and run from the bank.
ALEX
Go to the seminar, Carl!
You won't
be sorry!
Stackers is a cutesie brunch place.
Carl walks up to Peter,
Lucy and Kath.
KATH
(AWKWARD)
Morning, Carl. This is a surprise.
CARL
Why?
21.
KATH
Because I've never seen you at
brunch. Like ever.
CARL
You kidding? I love brunch.
Carl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a giant coffee and
several boxes of Munchkins. He walks by Renee, the cute girl
who hands out band fliers.
RENEE
Want a flier? Oh, it's you.
Never
mind.
CARL
Of course I'll take a flier.
Carl takes a flier.
Renee's surprised Carl's taking a flier.
CARL (cont'd)
(READING)
The Flying Buttresses.
RENEE
I knew after a year and a half of
wearing you down, you'd give in.
I'm Renee by the way.
Renee holds out her hand.
CARL
Carl.
RENEE
Carl. Cool. I like to thank
everyone personally who comes to
our performances. It gives it a
nice intimate touch. See you soon
Carl.
Carl turns away, nervous that he's accepted her invitation.
He takes a sip of his giant coffee and grimaces.
Carl and Rooney are outside.
Carl's nursing his wounds.
They are very, very drunk.
ROONEY
You popped that guy!
He didn't
know what hit him.
CARL
You do not cross Carl Kendall.
The Hot Girl STUMBLES out of Senor Frog's.
40.
HOT GIRL
Hey. I'm sorry about Domingo. He
likes to think he's my boyfriend
but he's not. You're cute.
The Hot Girl KISSES Carl.
HOT GIRL (cont'd) (CONT'D)
Want to go some place private?
CARL
Yes.
Carl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a frozen coffee
drink and several boxes of Munchkins. He walks by Renee and
wordlessly takes a flier.
RENEE
Hey, give that back.
You already
took one.
CARL
What's the hurt in taking another?
48.
RENEE
Destroys the Earth. Also, they
cost me ten cents a copy. Besides,
are you even going to come?
CARL
Of course.
I couldn't say `no.'
As he walks away...
CARL (cont'd)
Even if I wanted to.
RENEE
See you tonight, Carl!
Carl walks down the street, taking fliers from anyone who
passes them out. We do QUICK CUTS of him with various people
as he walks down the street.
CARL
I might have some stuff to pawn./I
will definitely check out your gun
selection./I would like to learn
Korean.
BERLITZ FLIER GUY
If you're interested, intro to
Korean is starting right now.
50.
Carl has helped Renee fit the giant harp into the back of her
ancient Volvo.
RENEE
Well, thanks for coming, Carl.
I
must bid good night.
CARL
So early?
It's only 8:00?
RENEE
I lead a jogging, photo group for
people who want to both exercise
and practice photography.
CARL
You're a photographer too?
RENEE
Amateur, but yeah.
I show every
Friday.
(MORE)
53.
RENEE (cont'd)
If you want to do some artistic
calisthenics join us tomorrow.
CARL
What time do you leave?
RENEE
Five.
So we can see the sunrise.
CARL
Wow. I haven't seen the sunrise
maybe ever.
(RESIGNED)
I guess now I'll be doing that
tomorrow.
RENEE
Oh, it's beautiful. Makes great
photos. Nice meeting you, Carl.
Renee gets in her Volvo and drives off.
Carl walks off.
FLIER GUY
You interested in learning Spanish?
Carl takes the flier from the Flier Guy.
Carl walks down the street, now holding a zillion fliers.
Carl gets a tap on the shoulder. REVEAL Kath standing there.
KATH (O.S.)
Thinking of learning a couple
foreign languages?
CARL
Hey, Kath. Would you like one?
I'm going to learn Swahili.
KATH
Maybe next week. There's someone
you should probably meet. Carl,
this is Seb.
A very tall, very blond, Nordic looking man approaches Carl.
CARL
Seb?
What is that?
Swedish?
SEB
Yes.
54.
Beat. Seb puts his hand on Kath's back.
Carl notices this
and is not particularly happy.
SEB (cont'd)
I've heard a lot about you, Carl.
Seb's phone rings.
SEB (cont'd)
Sorry, sweetie. I've got to take
this.
Seb walks off and answers his cell.
CARL
You're on a date then?
KATH
Yeah.
Met him at my firm.
CARL
He's very tall.
KATH
I guess so, yeah.
Seb returns.
CARL
Well, it was nice meeting you, Seb.
So I'll be going.
Carl starts to walk off.
SEB
Unless... you'd like to join us?
Carl stops in his tracks. He mouths the word "fuck." Carl
turns. Kath nods at Carl as in, "You don't have to join us."
SEB (cont'd)
It was good meeting you --
CARL
I'd love to. Join you guys.
KATH
What?
55.
Renee, along with several other amateur photographers in
sweat suits, have gathered. They all have big cameras around
their necks. Carl walks up to them. He does not look good.
CARL
Good morning.
57.
RENEE
Wow.
You look tired.
CARL
Well, it is five in the morning.
RENEE
Mammals are meant to be up at dawn.
It's how we're built biologically.
Where's your camera?
Carl realizes he forgot his camera.
CARL
I thought I'd use my phone.
Carl pulls out his camera cell phone.
RENEE
Awesome idea. So light.
CARL
That's what I thought.
RENEE
Let's hit it.
Renee, Carl and the group of amateur jogging photographers
start jogging. Carl can barely keep up with them.
RENEE (cont'd)
Oooh, pretty.
As she passes a flower, Renee snaps a photo of it.
The group reaches the lake as the sun rises. They all snap
photos. Carl finds himself snapping photos on his camera.
He accidentally snaps one of Renee with the sun behind her.
She looks pretty in the photo.
RENEE
Alright!
Enough standing around!
Renee starts jogging again. Carl starts after her and then
abruptly doubles over and throws up on the ground. Renee and
the other jogging/photographers snap photos of him.
58.
Carl has put the last box into the moving van.
Rooney and
his mom are hugging.
ROONEY'S MOM
I'm going to miss you, baby.
ROONEY
And I'm going to miss you, ma.
ROONEY'S MOM
I can't watch you go.
His mom goes into her house.
CARL
Where are you moving?
Rooney looks at Carl and smiles.
Carl's eyes go wide.
MUSIC CUE: "JUMP" by the Pointer Sisters
YES MONTAGE
-- Carl's taking Korean.
CARL (cont'd)
(in Korean)
[What is the weather like in
Pyongyang?]
-- At Southwest Bank.
NORMAN
We need a volunteer to think up
local marketing ideas
Carl raises his hand.
CUT TO LATER
Carl has put up signs on the bank window that say "Pet-a-
Puppy" day. There's a box of puppies in the bank. Customers
are streaming into the bank to pet puppies.
65.
-- We see Carl's CALENDAR filling up.
-- A ton of different kinds of credit cards are POPPING
THROUGH HIS MAIL SLOT.
-- Carl's taking Spanish.
CARL
(in Spanish)
[I like to drive with my mother.]
The door to the language center opens.
-- Carl walks towards work. He sees the same group of flyer
guys and DUCKS DOWN an alleyway. We now see that to avoid
the flyer guys he uses a series of alleys and fire escapes,
crossing roofs, even jumping between two buildings so he can
avoid being approached.
-- At Southwest Bank.
NORMAN
We need someone to be a weekend
cashier.
Carl's hand shoots up.
-- Carl walks out of a movie with a woman who's in a head
scarf. He awkwardly hugs her. REVEAL that the movie they
watched is Saw III.
-- Carl's at THE NOTE singing along to Renee's band's songs.
He and the "Jester" audience member do shots together.
-- Carl's walking around a florist shop with Lucy. She
points to a small bouquet of white flowers. Carl points to a
giant heart-shaped ice sculpture.
-- We see Carl having to write in tiny letters on his
calendar because it's so full.
-- At Southwest Bank.
NORMAN (cont'd)
We need a volunteer --
Carl's hand shoots up.
NORMAN (cont'd)
-- to be in charge of day care.
-- CUT TO Carl with a bunch of kids. All the kids are
folding brand new dollar bills into paper airplanes
66.
-- CUT TO Carl walking down the street, a big smile on his
face, taking everyone's fliers as per usual. He walks past a
CULTY GUY named TONY who's passing out books.
TONY
Do you want to change your life
through Mahayana Buddhism?
Carl takes one of the books.
TONY (cont'd)
Would you like to have tea and
discuss?
CARL
I'm kind of in a rush...
TONY
My place is right around the
corner.
Carl RUNS up to the bakery.
Lucy's outside.
LUCY
What happened?
CARL
I'm sorry -- bank meeting stuff.
84.
Carl PULLS UP and RUNS inside.
Carl's outside with Peter.
PETER
Nice job with Renee. She's
definitely odd, but that's not
necessarily --
91.
CARL
I just spent $1500 on dinner.
PETER
What?
Why?
CARL
Because the waiter asked me if I
wanted the expensive wine and you
weren't there to stop me!
PETER
Don't get mad at me about it.
You
can just stop.
CARL
No I can't. If I didn't say yes to
the band flier, I never would have
met Renee. If I hadn't said yes to
taking charge of bank day care and
then yes to becoming a loan
specialist and then yes to the
president's golf trip, I wouldn't
be moving up. Each yes leads to
the next one. If I stop, it could
all fall apart.
PETER
You've gone from a passive guy who
always said no to a passive guy who
always says yes. Just saying yes
is not a legitimate life
philosophy.
CARL
I don't know why I should be taking
advice from a guy who's wife is
pissed he's not involved at all
with the wedding planning.
PETER
I'm involved.
CARL
You told her you don't care whether
the invite's cream or ivory.
PETER
I can't see the difference.
(opening up)
Honestly, I'm terrified.
92.
CARL
What?
Why?
PETER
It's marriage, you know?
The
biggest thing ever.
CARL
But you guys have dated for years.
PETER
I know.
CARL
You're perfect for each other.
PETER
I know.
CARL
She's terrified too.
PETER
Really?
CARL
Of course she is. I think you'll
both be a lot less terrified if
you're terrified together.
PETER
But what if I really can't tell the
difference between ivory and cream?
Does that make me a bad husband?
CARL
What matters is that you pretend
you can see the difference.
The girls and Seb come out from the restaurant with their
coats on. There's a silent beat.
GIRLS
(high pitched goodbyes)
It was wonderful meeting you!/I
loved it!/Let me know when you
throw your next art thing!
Everyone gets into their cars.
Carl and Renee walk off.
RENEE
It was great meeting your friends.
93.
CARL
They're a little stiff.
Beat.
RENEE
They are a little stiff.
What do
you feel like doing?
CARL
I'm actually going rollerblading
with Ralph.
RENEE
Ralph?
CARL
You know, crazy rollerblading
guitar man.
RENEE
The guy who plays at the promenade?
CARL
Any interest?
RENEE
No. It's ten on a Friday night.
And that guy's crazy. Don't you
want to go home and make out?
CARL
Yes.
Carl and CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN rollerblade down the
street while guitar man plays guitar.
94.
CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN
Which is why the merman is not to
be trusted, especially with the
fisherman's computer brain.
CARL
That is really good to know.
CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN
You want to come see the merman?
CARL
(RELUCTANT)
Yes.
Chris and Carl follow the Koreans.
CHRIS PARKER
You speak Korean?
CARL
Just a little.
CHRIS PARKER
You sneaky devil. I knew I should
watch my back around you.
CARL
Is it a problem if I've never
played golf before?
CHRIS PARKER
You're a funny one, Carl Kendall.
Remember, they have to win. In
Asian cultures, there's a concept
called Saving Face. You have to
let them win. But if they smell
for a second that you haven't tried
your hardest, they'll commit hari
kari.
CARL
Metaphorically?
CHRIS PARKER
Who knows? It's a delicate
balance, Kendall. Like two little
girls on a see saw with a crocodile
beneath them. Make the wrong move,
and the little girl will end up in
the croc's maw.
Carl stands with the Koreans. Seung Kim is speaking very
rapidly at Carl. Carl has no idea what he's saying. Seung
Kim laughs. Carl laughs along with him. Chris hits a
beautiful shot. His ball lands almost on the green. The
Koreans notice and nervously chatter. Chris approaches Carl.
96.
CHRIS PARKER
Alright, buddy. It's all you.
Carl grabs a nine iron from the golf bag.
Everyone seems
very impressed.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)
You must have quite a powerful
stroke.
CARL
I do.
SEUNG KIM
(in Korean, to Carl)
[Good luck, my friend.]
CARL
(in Korean)
[I shall need the luck.
This is my
first time playing.]
Seung Kim laughs.
CARL (cont'd)
(under his breath)
Why does everyone think I'm joking?
Carl gingerly places the golf ball on the tee.
He looks
towards the hole.
CARL (cont'd)
That's really far.
Carl lines up his shot. He swings back, then forward, and
PLOWS the club into the grass, knocking the ball off the tee.
The ball rolls down a slight incline resting just a couple
feet from where Carl hit it.
CARL (cont'd)
(in Korean, to Seung Kim)
[You're up, Seung Kim.]
Carl walks back to where Chris is at.
CHRIS PARKER
What was that?
CARL
Just keeping them on their toes.
Reverse psychology. Tiger Woods
does it.
97.
Seung Kim raises his club back. He too dubs it, driving the
club deep into the grass. His ball rolls just a couple feet
past Carl.
GOLF MONTAGE WHEREIN CARL AND SEUNG KIM COMPETE TO NOT BE THE
ABSOLUTE WORST GOLF PLAYER EVER
-- Carl hits the ball straight into a group of trees.
-- Seung Kim, standing right in front of a pond, delicately
taps his ball right into the pond.
-- Carl keeps divoting the grass. He divots so many times
that he has to move the ball out of the hole's he's
accidentally dug.
-- Seung Kim hits his ball out of the sand trap. It rolls
back in. He tries again. It rolls back in. He's about to
try again when Carl picks up his ball and tosses it over the
lip of the sand trap. Carl holds his finger up to his lips:
"Shhh."
-- Carl's about to hit the ball when his phone rings.
He
answers it.
CARL (cont'd)
Of course not.
The other golfers look really impatient.
CARL (cont'd)
Male.
(BEAT)
Apartment.
(BEAT)
I prefer light beer.
(BEAT)
Three to five times a week.
(BEAT)
Orlando.
Carl holds up his finger.
Only one moment.
-- It's
getting late. Now both Carl and Seung Kim are
hitting
their balls at once to save time. They are both
running
and hacking at their balls across the fairway as if
they're
playing a deranged game of field hockey.
Carl is counting up the scores.
98.
CARL
Chris, you hit a 90.
Nice one.
CHRIS PARKER
I bogied the fifth hole.
I'm still
pissed about that.
CARL
Joo-Chan hit a 95. Nice work.
As
for Seung Kim. You hit 453.
Seung glowers at Carl.
CARL (cont'd)
And as for me, I hit...
(doing some computations)
... 503.
SEUNG KIM
Yes!
Seung Kim pumps his fist.
CARL
I'm sorry to say that team Korean
Bank International has won.
Seung Kim slaps five with his compatriots.
Carl's shaking hands with the Korean Bank Representatives.
Chris shakes Carl's hand.
CHRIS PARKER
I'm promoting you to bank manager.
(pulling Carl close)
I've got my eye on you, boy. Don't
you forget it.
Chris laughs. Carl nervously laughs along with him. The
Pretty Korean Banker walks by and waves at him. Carl waves
back. He looks very guilty.
Carl and Renee stand outside.
RENEE
We don't have to do this.
CARL
We're here. We might as well.
Carl and Renee RIDE A TRACTOR.
Renee's taking photos as they
BUMP OVER THE FIELD.
CARL
THIS IS AWESOME!
TRACTOR DRIVER
WANT ME TO OPEN THIS SUCKER UP?
CARL/RENEE
YES!
The driver TURNS UP THE SPEED.
They're suddenly going crazy
fast.
TRACTOR DRIVER
TAKE THE WHEEL! FEEL THE POWER OF
JOHN DEERE!
Carl takes the wheel. The tractor IMMEDIATELY GETS AWAY FROM
HIM. They SWERVE STRAIGHT and CRASH THROUGH THE WALL OF AN
OLD BARN. The DRIVER kills the engine. Renee, Carl and the
Driver catch their breath.
CARL
There's, uhh, no power steering.
TRACTOR DRIVER
It's a tractor, not a Toyota.
CARL
I'm sorry about the barn.
106.
TRACTOR DRIVER
Been meaning to tear this sucker
down anyway.
Carl and Renee walk around a surprisingly pretty city park.
RENEE
I think I might have whiplash from
that tractor ride.
CARL
Just don't sue me.
RENEE
Watch your back, Carl.
I mean it.
I'm very litigious.
CARL
This day has been so randomly
incredible.
RENEE
Would you... want to... travel
around the world with me?
(THEN)
I mean, I know we haven't really
been seeing each other for that
long, but I don't know...
CARL
Yes.
RENEE
Yes?
CARL
Definitely.
RENEE
I think I'm falling, you know...
Are you... ?
CARL
Yes.
They kiss.
RENEE
Before our flight, what do you say
we grab a couple Nebraskan steaks?
107.
CARL
I'm definitely falling for you.
Carl's sitting on the steps.
Renee comes out of the station.
RENEE
What the hell happened?
CARL
I can explain.
RENEE
So explain. Are you a drug
smuggler?
111.
CARL
Look, when the nice lady asked me
to take them on the plane, I
thought they were chocolates.
RENEE
You expect me to believe a nice
lady asked you to bring chocolates
on a plane?
CARL
I know how it sounds.
RENEE
I don't think you do.
Carl just looks at her.
RENEE (cont'd)
If you can't be honest with me,
then you and the nice lady can have
a fun life in Candyland.
Renee starts off.
CARL
Wait!
I'll explain better.
She turns back around.
Southwest Bank employees and Carl stand in a picket line
outside the corporate offices.
EMPLOYEES
Hell no! We won't go!
Hell no!
We won't go!
Chris gets out of his car and heads to the office. Carl
hides his face from Chris so that Chris won't recognize him.
ROONEY
Throw a rock at him.
NORMAN
Yeah, throw a rock!
Carl grabs a rock and VERY DELICATELY LOBS IT in Chris's
direction. He then TAKES OFF RUNNING in the opposite
direction. He then CIRCLES AROUND and runs into the back
entrance of the bank.
Carl drives down the street in a FANCY CAR. He PULLS INTO
DUNKIN DONUTS. He gets out of the car and passes a guy
handing out fliers.
FLIER GUY
You want to pawn --
CARL
No.
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.
Carl's standing outside. Peter comes outside.
He's drunk
and is still wearing the crown.
PETER
What're you doing out here?
Carl hands Peter a set of keys.
CARL
I entrust you to sell all my shit.
PETER
What're you talking about?
A cab PULLS UP.
Peter realizes Carl's leaving.
PETER (cont'd)
Say hello to her when you see her.
Where is she by the way?
Carl's in a tuk tuk being driven at breakneck speed down the
windy streets of Bangkok.
MUSIC CUE: ABBA's "One Night in Bangkok"
130.
Carl gets up to the roof. Renee's looking out over Bangkok.
He taps her on the shoulder. She turns.
RENEE
What're you doing here?
CARL
Yes.
RENEE
I didn't ask you a question.
CARL
Well, if you do that's what my
answer will be.
RENEE
Are you here because you want to be
here?
CARL
I just flew twenty-two hours. What
do you think? Now can I please
kiss you?
Renee nods.
They kiss.
CHYRON: Makurdi, Nigeria
Carl and Renee get out a dusty minivan. A dirty, rundown
palace rises before them. Carl HEADS to the front door and
hits the BUZZER. A guard with a MACHINE GUN opens up.
MACHINE GUN GUARD
What do you want?
CARL
I'm here to see Omar.
The former
King of Nigeria.
OMAR, THE FORMER KING OF NIGERIA, a large, boisterous man,
comes up from behind the guard.
OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA
Is that Carl Kendall?
CARL
Omar! It's wonderful to meet you
in person
Carl and Omar hug.
OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA
And this must be Renee? What a
delight!
Omar bends on one knee and kisses Renee on the hand.
RENEE
Thank you, your majesty.
OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA
Please, call me Omar.
132.
CARL
I'm sorry for calling you a
masturbatory Russian teenager.
OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA
Water under the bridge. What do
you say to having a feast?
Carl, Omar, Renee and the guard go into Omar's palace. The
door CLOSES BEHIND THEM.
