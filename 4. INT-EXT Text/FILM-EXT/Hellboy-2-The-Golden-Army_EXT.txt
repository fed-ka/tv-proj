Park Avenue in mid-December. On the lampposts, Xmas lights
sparkle over streets slick with slush and rain. Limousines
line up for a public function.
SUPERIMPOSURE:
BLACKWOOD'S AUCTION HOUSE
Under black umbrellas, wealthy men and women exit the limos
and enter a stately ten-story building. On the facade, a
sign reads: TONIGHT - TREASURES OF PRE-CHRISTIAN EUROPE.
A SHADOWY FIGURE lurks in an alley near the corner. His
features are hidden by a broad-brimmed hat. He watches as-
The guests present gleaming, golden invitations to the
security people at the door.
SHADOWY FIGURE
(in Elvish, subtitled)
I'll go up first. You'll enter from below-
He addresses WINK, an eight-foot tall TROLL with grey skin
and a huge scar over his left, empty, eye socket. His right
hand is missing and he sports a heavy IRON MACE instead. A
plume of breath escapes from his brutish mouth.
SHADOWY FIGURE (CONT'D)
And remember Wink-
(BEAT)
Don't be shy.
He extends his arms and with a swoop, he climbs the wall,
up, up, like a bat. Five floors up...

Guards with German Shepherds patrol the fence line.
Searchlights sweep the surrounding woods.
Super: BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
TRENTON, N.J. 10.08 P.M.
The cops have surrounded the building and helicopters hover
overhead.

The BPRD garbage truck pulls to stop.

Manning is holding forth in a sidewalk press conference.
MANNING
The situation is completely under
control. Earlier tonight, customs agents
discovered a few illegally imported
items. This caused a minor confrontation.
The reporters go wild with questions.
MANNING (CONT'D)
Federal agents have now taken over the
premises. We ask that you all step back-
Manning basks in the flashbulb glow and acknowledges a
pretty young REPORTER.

Yes, Debra-?
20 TNT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 20
Plaster spills from widening cracks in the wall. Hellboy
shoots, blowing open a massive hole.
He peeks inside-
Small bodies burrow away like moles.
HELLBOY
What are they-? Abe?
A ball of fire erupts from an upstairs balcony. The crowd
and reporters look up, amazed.
MANNING
(MUTTERING)
Evidently we have a- gas pocket-
somewhere in-
The reporters stampede towards the explosion, leaving
Manning alone and fuming.
MANNING (CONT'D)
Hey guys, hey guys, come back!!
HELLBOY 2 16
28
The crowd is screaming. Half a dozen smoldering fairies
climb out of the smoking crater and snarl at the crowd.
People shrink back in horror. One of the hungry critters
jumps at a woman but-
BLAM!! Hellboy shoots it in mid-air, then calmly and
efficiently shoots its fellows.
Finally, he plucks one last creature off his coat. He holds
it up by the tail, like a rodent.
Manning hurries forward, witness to his worst nightmare. A
sea of camera flashes explodes on a grinning Hellboy.
HELLBOY
(looks at Manning)
Gee whiz, Manning-
(SHRUGS)
I guess we're out now.

Waving his nightstick, Guard 2 approaches the intruder.
Their elongated shadows loom up above them on a brick wall.
GUARD 2
Hey- buddy- get the-
The THE SHADOWY FIGURE whirls and drops his coat. He
unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the air around the
guard.
The guard's shadow in the background is cut into three parts
and collapses.

The Garbage truck and a few other BPRD vehicles crossthe
Washington Bridge on the way to CHINATOWN.
SIGN: WASHINGTON BRIDGE 21.00 HOURS
Agents cordon off the street with yellow tape, holding the
press at bay. As the truck rolls by, hordes of bystanders
push forward, hoping for a glimpse of Hellboy.
Some of them chase run alongside the vehicle, carrying
support/hatred signs.
MANNING
May I suggest that tonight you refrain
from signing autographs.
HELLBOY
It's the garbage truck. It makes the
wrong statement. About who we are.
MANNING
You think that's what this is about?
Transportation???
HELLBOY 2 34
The truck stops near other official vehicles. Overhead, the
soaring roadbed of the Brooklyn Bridge.
At the sight of the BPRD team, some protestors throw eggs.
Hellboy shields Liz from the barrage.
REPORTER 2
C'mon- show us your powers-
ABE
Oh- No, no, no, it's not a parlor trick.
REPORTER 1
What are you, a mermaid??
ABE
Oh, goodness, no- I-
REPORTER 2
You say you can read things- things about
people- so read me- c'mon- read me-
The crowd of reporters and onlookers laughs and applauds.
REPORTER 2 (CONT'D)
What do you see?
ABE
Very well, if you insist.
(webbed hand on reporter's chest)
You... keep... a large, battery-operated
vibrating egg by your bedside...
A shrieking CAMERA CREW runs up loaded with video equipment.
REPORTER
You! Demon-man! Will you take a DNA test?
HELLBOY
It's "Hellboy" not "Demon-man"-
One of the projectiles hits him. The crowd roars. Hellboy
gazes back at them- seething.
JOHANN
Let me take care of this.
Johann bravely confronts the news teams and the crowd.
HELLBOY 2 35
JOHANN (CONT'D)
Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Johann
Kraus and I beg you to allow us-
(interrupted by catcalls)
-Please, we need space to work- please-
WE-
The REPORTERS bombard him with questions. He signals for
silence.
JOHANN (CONT'D)
In due time- very soon- we will provide
all the answers you require, all the
whos, whys and wherefors- But for now-
An egg hits him in the face- hard. The crowd roars-
HELLBOY
Great P.R...
He gets ready to pummel the crowd. Liz stops him.
LIZ
Shh! Give him a chance...
JOHANN
-it's been a long... long time... for
many decades really, that the BPRD has
served you- all of you... in silence. We
have waged an unknown war - but a very
real one. Heroes have died unrewarded and
unrecognized so that you might go about
your daily life. To work, to marry, to
bid your children goodnight.
Little by little, the crowd grows quiet.
JOHANN
In exchange, we have been consigned to
the lies and racist innuendo of the
tabloids. And there we have lived without
complaint - until now.

54 MONTAGE
Johann's speech is replayed in broadcast TV VANS, HOMES,
PUBS and BARS all over the world to a fascinated human
population. All colors and creeds.
HELLBOY 2 36
JOHANN (CONT'D)
But perhaps soon- after learning of our
hardships and sacrifices, you may decide
that our humble lives may, in some way,
have a value... and a meaning-
- DOCKS - NIGHT 55
The camera lights reflect off Johann's glass head.
JOHANN
I pray that you will allow us to defend
your good fortune- to guarantee the
blessing that is a peaceful night's
sleep. A night free from monsters and
nightmares. And if so-
(chokes back tears)
If so- then all we ask in return... from
you... is a little respect and the
chance, remote as it may be, to prove
ourselves worthy of a tiny, tiny place in
this- God's Earth.
HELLBOY
(rolls his eyes)
This is sooo corny-
A moment of silence ensues--
Then, the wet-eyed reporters applaud- the crowd applauds-
Liz applauds, Abe applauds. Hellboy is agog!!
HELLBOY
What-?? What-??
ABE
(DAZZLED)
He has a nice voice.
All business now, Johann steps over to the group.
JOHANN
Come on. We have work to do-
56
Hellboy, Abe and Johann peer over the cornice of a bowling
alley rooftop. The CROWDS are visible in the distance.
Hellboy looks through THE SCHUFFTEN GLASSES.
HELLBOY 2 37
HELLBOY
Nothing yet, Sparky, over-
57
The BPRD truck is parked behind the bowling alley, directly
under the bridge. Its back door is open; Liz and manning are
at the communications center.
LIZ
I read you, Red. Keep looking-
Manning is bored, looks at his watch.
MANNING
Looking at what, for goodness sake-?
(looks at the Schufften glasses)
What do these things do-?
Liz starts locking and unlocking a series of lenses and
prisms. Both Abe and Johan wear similar gear.
ABE
In 1778 Emil Schufften, a Good friend of
Benjamin Franklin, designed these optical
sets with the intent of photographing
fairies in England...
MANNING
Let's get out of here- We're never going
to find it-
HELLBOY'S VOICE
Hey- Sparky, I think we got one.
Manning studies the image on the monitor: a bag lady pushing
a shopping cart full of cats-
MANNING
That? Oh, please, she looks as sweet as
she can-
LIZ
Red, turn on the "antiglamour" filter...
(to Manning)
Fairy folk use a spell called "glamour"
to seem human and nice-
(BEAT)
These lenses allow you to see their real
appearance...

Bellboy turns a few knobs on the goggles, then raises them.

59 POV GOGGLES.
As a series filters enter the visual field, the bag lady
transforms into an ugly, muscle-bound troll.

Hellboy and Johann show a picture of a tooth fairy to a
surly SHOP OWNER.
SHOP OWNER
Never seen anything like it. No one sells
`em down here - over in Jersey, maybe.
Behind him, there's a faceless CAVE BERSERKER: a tall and
gnarly ogre, his naked chest crisscrossed with scars, his
feet encased in iron shoes.
Growling, it bares its teeth at HE. HB smiles back-
HELLBOY
Hiya, Chuck-
- SAME 69
Abe follows the Princess down an alley - and then another
one, narrow and dark. Panhandlers pull at his belt; he bats
them away.
70
Now Johann shows a drawing of the royal seal to the shop
owner.
JOHANN
What about this?? Do you recognize this
seal?
HELLBOY 2 42
The shop owner's face suddenly grows pale.
SHOP OWNER
You'd better go. Now.
JOHANN
Please. We'll make it worth your while.
The shop owner claps his hands. BERSERKER takes two steps
forward, ROARING. Its iron shoes go CLOMP-CLOMP!!
SHOP OWNER (CONT'D)
He's not friendly-
Hellboy huffs and walks up to the creature.
HELLBOY
Well, neither am I-
BAMMMM!!!!! With a single uppercut, he sends it flying
toward the ceiling, shoeless. The shop keeper watches in awe
until it lands, about thirty feet away in the middle of the
dogfight.
The crowd scatters as the mongrel creatures attack the thing
with blind instinct.
Hellboy grabs the shop owner by the lapels and pulls him
close. The shop owner's head rockets back and forth like a
boxer's speed bag as HB "gently" slaps him around. Teeth fly
everywhere.
HELLBOY
Feeling more chatty now??
SHOP OWNER
It's rumors! ... just- No- don't hit me,
all right? There's talk of a revolt- a
revolt against the human world-
Hellboy releases him, then looks around.
HELLBOY
Where the hell is Abe??
He pushes his belt locator-
HELLBOY 2 43
The locator's blue light dims; concerned, Hellboy and Johann
look at each other.
Seeing his chance, the shop keeper melts away into the
crowd.
Silhouetted against a crimson sky, the shadows of thousands
upon thousands of goblins, elves and fairies do battle with
hordes of men.
PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
In those days, my people were led by my
Father, King BALOR, the one-armed king of
Elfland.
KING BALOR fights valiantly at the side of his son, the
tall, pale elf knight: PRINCE NUADA.
PRINCESS (V. 0.) (CONT'D)
The bloodshed went on year after year.
Many lives were lost.
An overview of the battlefield fades as the sun sinks below
the horizon.
As the humans make ready for battle, a tremor shakes the
earth. They turn their gaze to the horizon, which bristles
with the arms of the approaching troops.
HELLBOY 2 50
The fight is brutal. The mechanical soldiers mow down the
humans by the hundreds, their swords replaced as needed by
battle axes, bludgeons and lances.
PRINCESS (V.0.)
But this army knew no bounds, had no
remorse, felt no loyalty, engaging in
blind battle with man, woman or child.
The horde crushes everything, with swords slicing through
armor as if it were paper. Every blow is deadly, precise.
The army marches ever onward, like a grinding machine
devouring tender flesh.
At length, there is no sign of life in the human camp.
PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
And as the king gazed upon the earth
awash in blood and at the impassive metal
faces of the army he had created, his
heart grew heavy. Victory was gained at
too high a price. This war should never
have been waged.
The King surveys the carnage. The mechanical soldiers stand
in symmetrical ranks awaiting further instructions.
PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
And so he arranged a truce: the surviving
men would keep to their cities and we
children of the Earth would dwell within
the forests. This pact, he declared,
would be honored by our sons and the sons
of their sons until the end of time.
Listening to his father, Prince Nuada reacts with anguish.
PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
But my brother did not believe in the
promises of men. He marched off into
exile, vowing to return if the Sons of
the Earth ever needed him.
Prince Nuada walks away towards a dying sunset.

Outside, the civilians flee, but the news crews come
is back. He
running. As their lights blaze up, REPORTER 2
gapes in disgust:
Hellboy's massive hands are wrapped around the neck of a
sweet little OLD LADY! He beats her mercilessly!
OLD LADY
Help me...! Please, somebody..!
REPORTER 2
(to his cameraman)
Oh, my God!! Oh, my- Roll! Roll on this!
BELLBOY
It's not what you think -!
HELLBOY 2 54
REPORTER
(pointing at HB)
He's lost his mind! He's worse than any
of them..!
CUT BACK to Hellboy, revealing that the old lady is actually
WINK.
Liz runs over with a prism from the SCHUFFTEIN GOGGLES and
sticks it in front of the camera lens, revealing the truth.
The reporter checks his monitor.
REPORTER
OH-
86 STREET FIGHT 86
ALL the BPRD team, including Liz, is swept up in this fight.
The denizens of the troll market overturn parked cars and
knock down lamp posts, ROARING with excitement.
LIZ
(MUTTERING)
The fire is not my enemy-- it is a part
of me--
Liz yells out a warning... and then throws a barrage of
flaming bolts. A pair of crab-like THINGS shrivel and burn.
Johann melds with a heavy steel dumpster, until only his
legs are visible beneath it. Bending at the waist - SPLAT -
he brings it down on the head of the nearest creature!
WINK and HB duke it out for a few beats and then HB finally
vanquishes the Troll, Ripping his Iron Mace off and throwing
it away.
As the other monsters retreat...
.the PRINCE appears: in his hand a complex mechanical
GRENADE. Immediately worried, Abe hustles the Princess over
to the BPRD truck.
The Prince twists a timer. His bloodied trolls disperse,
screaming, renewing the panic.
PRINCE
(to Hellboy)
I will find you, young daemon -
(to Nuala)
- and you, too, my sister. Meanwhile,
here's a taste of what lies in store.
HELLBOY 2 55
He throws the grenade. Hellboy dives, just in time to catch
it. He's about to throw it down a sewer, when he listens to
its clockwork innards then: PING!!!!
HELLBOY
It's a dud, your royal assness - !
The Prince has disappeared, along with his horde.
HELLBOY
How do you like that? Just when I was
loosening up.
Then... CLACKK!!!.
Hellboy scrutinizes the grenade as it opens up like a
beans.
flower... and spews out a handful of Brightly colored
ABE
Pick them up!!
HELLBOY
Abe. relax- It's jumping beans...
Abe is scrambling to retrieve them.
ABE
Do as I say!
With a sigh, Hellboy scoops up a few.
ABE
How many do you have?
HELLBOY
Three, how about you?
ABE
Three! There's always seven! Find the
last one!!!
TO
The seventh bean is next to a manhole. It hops closer
edge...
ABE
Quick, it's going for water!
Hellboy reaches for it... but it's too late. The thing hops
into the manhole and lands somewhere below with a SPLASH.
ABE (CONT'D)
Oh, my God, evacuate the area!
HELLBOY 2 56
HELLBOY
Abe, please, get a grip.
A RUMBLE from below their feet. WHAMMMM!
A HUGE TREE punches up through the pavement, overturning
cars, knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping
up through the Bridge overpass!!
Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into
the moonlit clouds.
Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in
fascination. Birds and creatures emerge from the inside and
flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a moment
Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden.
HELLBOY (CONT'D)
Whoa. Just like the story books.
Manning and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING
climbs on Liz's shoulder and a couple of IRIDESCENT
HUMMINGBIRDS fly around her "ala" SNOW WHITE. A small crowd
starts wandering into this idyllic scenario.
LIZ
This is so beautiful-
MANNING
So- perfect- so peaceful-
HELLBOY
Hey!!!
He spots. the prince, at the base of the tree. Knocking on it-
HELLBOY
Hey- Jhonny Apleseed- What are you-?? Oh-
Jeez did you have to do that??
Liz starts pulling Manning away and yelling at the crowd-
LIZ
Back- Go back- right now!!!
MANNING
What? What? What is he doing-?
LIZ
He's knocking on wood- summoning an
ELEMENTAL-
HELLBOY 2 57
MANNING
An elem-
LIZ
A forest spirit that lives in that tree.
He's releasing it-
MANNING
Oh, and is it that bad??
KKKRRRRCHTCH!!!!! The tree trunk rumbles and shakes under
some enormous force. Huge LEAVES tumble to the street. Even
the ever-present NEWS CREWS back away as a huge shape
descends.
BOOM!! the trunk rips in two, revealing a curled, dormant
ELEMENTAL.
Five stories high- Fierce as nature. THE ELEMENTAL steps out
of the tree and stares at Hellboy.
Uttering a weird, guttural SOUND, the Giant raises an arm
and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK!
WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight,
turning his baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks
back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling. In a
single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel.
HELLBOY
Good dog.
(to Elemental)
Now, Woody... You want to fight someone,
you fight with me.
Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee.
The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his
limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off.
ABE
(to the Princess)
This may not be the best place for you,
your majesty. With your permission...
He offers the Princess his arm. She takes it and allows Abe
to lead her away. A moment later, the Elemental smashes the
ground where they had been standing!
Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and
branches. The roots connecting to its feet and leading to
the original tree trunk, like an umbilical cord.
Johann sees this-
HELLBOY 2 58
JOHANN
I have a plan-
He looks at Abe-
87 STANDING AT THE GARBAGE TRUCK 87
-as the fishman helps the Princess up into the rear of the
BPRD garbage truck.
Up front, behind the wheel, Liz starts the engine.
88 ABANDONED BUILDING
88
Hellboy climbs a fire escape as the Elemental's arm/branches
extend and grow over the ladder, pulling it down below his
feet. Hellboy ducks into one of the open windows as the
Elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding. Growing
and discarding branches and roots.
Hellboy steps out onto a ledge ten stories up, just out of
reach of the Elemental.
HELLBOY
(to the Elemental)
What now, Big Boy? You get a ladder?
The Elemental jumps up and down, trying to reach him,
barking in frustration.
Hellboy's RADIO crackles:
ABE
(on the radio)
HB? This is Blue. The Princess is fine.
HELLBOY 2 59
HELLBOY
So what?
JOHANN
So, lead him to the bridge.
Hellboy looks over the buildings and sees the Brooklyn
Bridge in the distance.
HELLBOY
That's nine blocks from here, Fishbowl!
ABE
You'll figure it out.
HELLBOY
What's at the bridge? Abe - ? Liz?
Hello???
No answer. Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing
neon sign reading "Hotel".
The Elemental smashes the letters "tel"... so Hellboy climbs
the "0" to the roof.
Hellboy makes a running start and leaps off the building. He
sails over the alley, reaches for the approaching cornice...
and almost loses his grip! He hangs on for dear life.
Behind him, the Elemental appears, climbing onto an adjacent
roof. As his feet smash through the skylights, the Elemental
pulls down a WATER TOWER. A wall of water rolls toward
Hellboy, like an ocean wave!
Hellboy leaps to the next roof... and the water shoots over
the edge of the building, cascading onto the street below.
Liz parks the truck near the Brooklyn Bridge. Using
binoculars, Abe peers out the back doors to see Hellboy
bringing the Elemental closer.
HELLBOY 2 60
ABE
Johann - they're almost here.
Johann moves among massive construction machinery. He stops
at a stack of heavy SPOOLS OF CABLE.
Abe comes running, pointing at the cable.
ABE
Yes. I had the very same idea...
He gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine
which holds a half mile of steel cable.
ABE
(gazing at the controls)
.but how do you operate this??
JOHANN
If you'll permit me...
Johann opens his fingers, and plunges both arms deep into
the mechanism! Instantly, the diesel engine STARTS UP.
JOHANN
(to Abe)
Stand back, Abe.
A hydraulic strut lifts the spool, then pitches it through
the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable. It splashes down
near the far shore of the East River.
JOHANN
Now, tie it onto the pontoons on the
other side.
(seeing Hellboy coming)
Quickly, Abe!
94 IN THE WATER 94
Abe races down a pier and dives smartly into the dark water.
Then he surfaces, surging dolphin-like toward the Manhattan
shore.
95 BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS 95
Hellboy makes it to the bridge... as, behind him, the
Elemental wades into the river, pushing aside boats and
barges.
HELLBOY 2 61
96
96 IN THE RIVER
Abe makes it to the other side, surfacing with the cable,
towing it to a half-submerged pontoon.
JOHANN (CONT'D)
(on the radio)
Macht schnell! Abe - make it fast!
The cable is a yard short of the anchor point! Abe tugs on
IT-
ABE
I need more!
JOHANN
No more available!
The Elemental's feet stomp through the river; he stumbles as
he encounters the submerged cable.
97
97 UNDERWATER
Clinging to the cable, Abe is dragged down, down down...
past rusting cars, oil drums... and a couple of rotting
CORPSES, their feet in tubs of cement!
Suddenly, Abe's head strikes a sunken truck, knocking him
unconscious. Blood seeps from his wound.
98
98 AT THE BRIDGE
As Hellboy climbs one of the bridge towers, he hears someone
calling out from above:
PRINCE
(to Hellboy)
Haven't you managed to kill it yet? You,
who were so eager for a fight?
The Prince is standing on top of the tower. He points at
Hellboy, then yells at the Elemental.
PRINCE
(to the Elemental)
Over here, dear friend...
SNATCH! The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy
wriggles in the massive wooden finger-like appendages.
HELLBOY 2 62
The Prince walks to the edge of the tower, near a steel
spire, his coat flapping in the night wind.
PRINCE
This might be a good chance for you to
come to your senses. Help us.
HELLBOY
I've been all through this! The answer's
still no!
Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable,
bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a
steel snake!
The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the
Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cable
TENSES-
JOHANN
(to Liz)
Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i
He points at the roots trailing into the river. Liz
concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out
of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet.
Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the
river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he
tosses Hellboy high into the air.
On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings
back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the
Elemental's back, right behind his head.
HELLBOY
Nap time, Big guy-
He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back
of the neck.
The cable tenses-
-The Elemental pitches forward-
The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at
him; his mouth opens as if to scream...
The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop
the bridge... exactly where the Prince had been standing.
Putting an end, it seems, to both of them.
HELLBOY 2 63
The Creature dies, but even as it does, its branches embrace
the steel structure and grow, Ultimately, blocks and blocks
of the city are now covered in trees and grass and mossy
leaves... A strangely beatific and precious change.
Liz runs up, looking out at the river as Abe emerges,
bleeding, but alive. Abe, Liz and Johann embrace firmly,
laughing and happy to be together.
Abe eyes the Princess standing nearby, smiling back at
him...
Hellboy meanwhile observes the group from a distance,
jealous, alone.
CUT TO:
Liz is looking out into Trenton NJ's light landscape. Johann
approaches her.
JOHANN
Are you alright-?
Liz nods weakly.
JOHANN
May I be of assistance??
LIZ
Maybe.
HELLBOY 2 70
JOHANN
He's a big brute, isn't he??
Liz chuckles.
JOHANN
But he has a good heart. I know it. He
means well.
LIZ
I think I may have made a mistake.
JOHANN
In what way, Mein Frau??
LIZ
Just a mistake- nothing important.
(SIGHS)
But sometimes being with him is not easy-
JOHANN
It never is. I know.
Lis looks at him with renewed interest.
JOHANN
I was married once. A long, long time
ago... And only after I lost her- I
realized that my life would never be
quite the same- And my loss lead me to
become what I am today...
Johann's human face materializes inside his glass helmet.
JOHANN
I- I tried constantly to make contact
with her-
DISSOLVE STARTS :
- SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT 104
104 FLASHBACK - CIRCA 2001
Johann's mouth opens and out of it emerges a large tendril
of ectoplasm. His neck engorges and the substance continues
to flow freely out of his mouth and fingertips--
JOHANN
It was only there- in the Ethereal plane
that I ever gazed upon her again...
CAMERA close in on several ceremonial candles burning in the
room. Their flame illuminating the eerie scene.
HELLBOY 2 71
Out of the mouths of the other guests, emerge other, equally
large ectoplasmic shapes.
They cross to-
105 THE ETHEREAL PLANE 105
Once there- they reform into humanoid shapes, vaguely
reminiscent of their mortal bodies.
JOHANN floats freely, approaching another humanoid form in
the void: That of a woman, his wife.
JOHANN'S VOICE
But it was there, while he was partially
on the ethereal plane, that disaster
STRUCK-
He is about to embrace his wife's form when a horrible
rumble occurs and the void bursts in flames, destroying and
distorting everything around him-
His wife's shape screams and evaporates.
The music can be heard at a distance.
A dark figure stands on a hill, amid the trees, listening
and watching... CAMERA MOVES IN: the Prince gazes at the
building.
CUT TO:
112
A mob of SCREAMING FANS outside the TV studio. The frenzy
intensifies when they see the Hummers pulling up.
As the BPRD team exits the cars, autograph seekers break
through the POLICE LINE and swarm around the heroes.
MANNING
Every agent on the field is on the case.
They will solve it--
Hellboy signs a color photo of himself with a flourish.
HELLBOY
There you go, pal. "To Jason, best
wishes, Hellboy."
FAN
(squints at the signature)
How am I supposed to read that?
BELLBOY
You don't like it?
HELLBOY 2 77
Irritated, he scowls at the fan. Manning takes him by the
elbow and leads him away.
HELLBOY
(to the fan)
That turns up on e-Bay, I'm gonna find
you, "Jason"...

News footage of the Ginza features YOKAI GHOSTS on a
rampage, destroying the stores and attacking salarymen.
ANNOUNCER 1
This is a news alert. Tokyo is under
assault - repeat - this city has been
attacked. Monstrous beings, defying
description, have waded into the Ginza-
The jumpy, handheld images are full of digital interference.
The spectral BEASTS drag down power lines and hurl cars.
ANNOUNCER I
- where police are helpless and hospitals
overwhelmed. One moment, please.
Moscow... come in, Moscow...
CUT TO:
Red Square, Moscow now seen in similar, shaky video.
Hundreds of citizens are running from a towering, DRAGON.
ANNOUNCER 2
This is CNN in Moscow, where a Dragon has
laid claim to Red Square. Yes- a DRAGON.
HELLBOY 2 83
The DRAGON heads towards the TV REPORTER and screeching, it
raises its PAW.
ANNOUNCER 2
Oh, my God...
CAMERA goes down, then the picture winks out.
Black screen. The HISS of static...
PAN off the monitor to Jay Leno, who sits in stunned
silence, like everyone else. Finally, he looks over at
Hellboy.
LENO
Friends of yours?
HELLBOY
(GROWL)
No -!
LENO
Then, may I ask what you're doing here?
Shouldn't you be out protecting humanity
instead of hooking up with our women?
At last, Hellboy explodes. Bellowing, he rips up the desk
and throws it through the backdrop!

The Princess snaps off the TV, looking worried.
Alone with her thoughts, she examines the curved gold piece
hanging from a chain around her neck. She closes her eyes
and shudders - trouble is near.
The Yrdgrig wakes up and whimpers.

.and takes off, barely under control, just missing the New
Jersey treetops.
CUT TO:
143 UNDERGROUND 143
The Prince pulls the Princess through fractured, roaring
tunnels. Here and there, the walls are pierced, allowing
light and ocean waves to enter.
Rounding a few corners, the Prince stops near a wall
decorated with a large, elaborate FRESCO. It shows a
stylized family tree, hunting scenes and naive renderings of
trolls, faeries and ogres.
PRINCE
Maybe this will help you remember who we
are, who you are... What our destiny is-
The Prince pushes his sister through a low doorway, out onto
A-
144 LEDGE 144
-overlooking a vast cavern, big as a stadium, lit by a
thousand torches. The mechanical ARMY stands knee-deep in
heaving seawater and foam.
PRINCE
They - they - will be mine to command,
whether you like it or not. Only after
our victory will you appreciate my
sacrifice... and yours.
The BPRD plane exits a bank of clouds and starts its descent
upon an Irish island surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
HELLBOY 2 94
Massive granite mountains encircle an impossibly green
valley.
146 TNT. BPRD PLANE COCKPIT - DAY 146
Early sunlight washes over Hellboy's body, who weakly groans
in Liz's arms.
HELLBOY
(to Liz)
Where are we, Liz..?
LIZ
Near the ocean, Red.We'regonna make you
well here.
148 SIGN:REYNVILLE,IRELAND. 148
The back doors of the cargo plane opens and out come Abe and
JOHANN-
Liz and Abe help Hellboy up to a gnarled TREE, twisted by
eons of wind.
Abe unfurls the map and points at a drawing of a similar,
weird tree.
ABE
This should be the portal. By all rights-
Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully.
JOHANN
Abe, bring the mapcase over here.
He's found a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest
branch joins the trunk. Abe slips the map back into its
crystal cylinder and holds it alongside: it looks to be a
perfect fit.
LIZ
Yes! Try it, Abe-
HELLBOY 2 95
JOHANN
Before you do anything... remember what
we're in for. A world unlike anything
we've ever known. Dangerous, deceptive...
LIZ
You're wasting time!
Abe inserts and twists the cylinder.
The tree comes to life, hauling its roots out of the ground,
bending them into a swaying arch.
JOHANN
Dangerous, deceptive... and hard to
leave.
They walk under the tree roots, into...
150
150 FAIRY WORLD
A transformed landscape. A perpetual nightland- Still
overlooking the same ocean, but now throbbing with pale
colors and twisted, Rackahm-esque contours.
The men start down the hill, into a valley bordered by a
rugged coastline.
CUT TO:
The team reaches the stony shore of a mile-wide inlet. Abe
brings out the map.
ABE
(pointing to the opposite shore)
Renvyle is over there.
They glance up and down the beach, looking for a boat.
Hellboy blinks and sniffs the air.
A GOBLIN speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the
shallows directly in front of them. By his side, sitting
atop of a tree: A SATYR and a CROW observe the group.
GOBLIN
I bid you welcome, strangers. Would you
be seeking safe passage to Renvyle?
BELLBOY 2 96
LIZ
Yes! Can you help us?
JOHANN
(QUIET)
Careful, Liz.
SATYR
I'm sure you can come to an
understanding!
The Goblin heaves on an oar and emerges from behind the
rocks. He's standing in the stern of a sturdy little
coracle. Its wooden hull is painted in Celtic patterns.
GOBLIN
Room enough for all of you!
(looks at Hellboy)
Even your weary friend.
JOHANN
What will it cost, boatman?
The Goblin smiles, displaying a disconcerting row of
triangular teeth.
GOBLIN
Ah, next to nothing! Make me an offer.
Abe, Johann and Liz confer among themselves:
LIZ
How much?
CROW
He won't want money.
JOHANN
(to the goblin)
I have a... belt!
OF
Johann removes his equipment belt, dangling it in front
the creature's bat-like face.
GOBLIN
I have no use for such a thing.
Liz shows him her binoculars.
LIZ
Here... is a wonderful set of eyes, magic
eyes that will bring the world-
HELLBOY 2 97
GOBLIN
I already have binoculars! No, I see
something special.
He points toward Hellboy's chest.
SATYR
Under his bandage - !
Quick as a squirrel, the creature hops to Hellboy's side and
brings out a KNIFE! SWISH! In one sweep of the blade, he
reveals HB's terrible wound, and the speartip protruding
from it.
GOBLIN
That!
(points at the steel)
That - in exchange for your crossing!
LIZ
Don't you touch it - !
She rushes to Hellboy's side, pushing the Goblin back, ready
for a fight. The Goblin shrugs.
GOBLIN
Is it so precious to you? Let me pull it
out.
ABE
You mustn't. One touch can kill him.
The Goblin's eyes grow wide with understanding.
GOBLIN
Ah. I see. We must go to the Angel of
DEATH-
CROW
He'll know what to do.
The tiny boat is a dot on the golden waves of the inlet as
the Goblin rows them to the opposite shore and docks near a
cove.
The Goblin leads the way as Liz, Abe and Johann arrive and
help Hellboy up.
HELLBOY 2 98
Strange BIRDS hang upside down form the Cave's roof. A
MASSIVE CHIMNEY has been carved out of the cave's rock at
the other end. A Black, ancient figure is hunched there,
warming its skeletal hands by the fire.
A raspy voice utters something in an ancient language. The
Goblin replies, gesturing at Hellboy, who collapses on the
floor.
In a deep coma, Hellboy lies on the floor, near the
crackling fireplace. The ANGEL OF DEATH extends its FOUR
BLACK WINGS and a thin, jagged smile appears in its pale,
eyeless face.
ANGEL OF DEATH
So. This one... The boy- I remember him
well! Anung-un-Rama!
LIZ
Oh, my God. She knows - ?!
ANGEL OF DEATH
I helped bring him into this world - in
my fashion.
It pulls a set of a glowing, red-hot TONGS out of the fire.
It studies the speartip, which has buried itself deep in
Hellboy's flesh.
ANGEL OF DEATH (CONT'D)
I warn you: it is his destiny to rule
over the destruction of the Earth. Not
now, not tomorrow - but some day. You are
sure you want him to live?
LIZ
Yes, I say yes-!
Abe and Johann exchange a silent, worried look.
ANGEL OF DEATH
Very well, then- but let it be said: The
day will come when you will pay the price
fire girl: This will bring you and the
world much sorrow.
LIZ
And I'll deal with it when that time
comes. Now save him.
The creature cackles and then grips the spear tip with the
tongs. A cry of pain from Hellboy as it withdraws the bloody
point from his chest.
HELLBOY 2 99
The ANGEL OF DEATH holds up the speartip and looks at it
with distaste.
ANGEL OF DEATH
Harmless now.
(looking at Hellboy)
See - ?
Hellboy's eyes flutter open.
ANGEL OF DEATH
(to Hellboy)
Sleep now, child. Your strength, it will
return.
A guttural HISS from the corner: the Goblin is jumping up
and down, pointing at the speartip.
JOHANN
Our ferry captain - he wants his
payment...
ANGEL OF DEATH
Ach, outside with you!
She tosses the speartip to the creature, who scoops it up
and bounds out the door.
instantly, the goblins and birds leap down and crowd around
him, chattering in excitement over the latest prize.
She gazes down at Hellboy, whose yellow eyes are fixed on
her. He smiles wanly.
CUT TO:
Alone on a hilltop, Abe surveys the coastline. Through the
binoculars, he discerns a SECOND CAVE half-hidden behind
wild, breaking waves.
Glancing back at ANGEL OF DEATH's cave, Johann strikes off
on his own, headed for the cave.
Outside ANGEL OF DEATH's hut, a bandaged HB is sitting up,
blinking in the sunlight. He sips some tea and gazes at Liz,
who is happy now.
HELLBOY 2 100
LIZ
I almost lost you-
Hellboy smiles and grabs her hand-
HELLBOY
I thought you were mad at me.
LIZ
Well, no one can stay mad forever.
HELLBOY
I'm sorry for all the attention, I
thought it would be good for us.
LIZ
We're never going to make them all happy,
Red. What we have is ours and no one
ELSE'S-
BELLBOY
I can turn my back on the world. I don't
care anymore I don't- as long as you stay
with me- as long as you think I'm still a
good man.
(BEAT )
Am I a good man, Liz?? Am I??
LIZ
Yes you are. You are the best man I've
ever met.
HELLBOY
You still seem sad. Is there anything you
want to tell me-??
LIZ
Yes, there is-
HELLBOY
Say it now, then. Whatever it is, I'm
ready.
(SIGHS)
Is it about Johann-
LIZ
No- no- what are you talking about??
Before she can go on, Johann appears. He carries a poultice
and fresh rags.
BELLBOY 2 101
JOHANN
Abe and I have found the entrance to the
Golden Army's resting place- Liz come
with us-
(looks at Hellboy)
You should stay behind and get some rest-
HELLBOY
And call you in the morning, right?? Like
Hell I will. I'm keeping an eye on you,
GLASSHOLE-
CUT TO:
155
Johann, Liz and Hellboy follow a rugged trail along a bluff
high over the sea. Johann refers to the map, then points to
the cave opening a half-mile ahead. Abe is standing there,
WAVING-
JOHANN
There.
Abe points at the violent sea below-
ABE
The only way in- I'm afraid we'll have to
jump in-
(looks at Hellboy)
Can you make it-?
Hellboy nods.
BELLBOY
Strange. If this is the entrance-
ABE
I know- Why isn't there more security??
With a ROAR, WINK!!!!! - jumps out and throws a CHAIN around
Bellboy's neck!
The chain is connected to his IRON MACE which now dangles
around Hellboy's neck.
The two creatures battle each other fiercely. WINK's MACE
destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects
twice with Hellboy's head.
But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the chain in
two and twirling the mace like a boleador.
HELLBOY 2 102
He hits Wink again and again-
HELLBOY
See?? It hurts!!! It hurts!!!
Hellboy grips the chain, pulls the creature close, then,
like a weightlifter, raises him high overhead. With a mighty
GRUNT, Hellboy tosses him overboard. WINK hits the jagged
rocks once- twice- thrice-
HELLBOY
Ouch- ouch- ouch-
(looking around)
We better go swimming before any more
ugly fellas show up-
He stares down into the swirling waters and discreetly takes
his hand to his bandaged side: He's bleeding. The wound has
re-opened.
ABE
Red, are you-?
HELLBOY
Don't say a word, Blue- Let's move on-
156
156 UNDERWATER
Johann plunges in from above, his body quickly tumbled by
the rough seas. A moment later, Liz and Hellboy are in the
water, too.
Johann swims down, leading them into the darkness of the
cave entrance.
The BPRD team crosses waterfalls and stone bridges, through
the magical hills.
Liz walks at Hellboy's side, but he avoids her glance.
164
They reach the strange, twisted tree. Johann takes the map
cylinder and fits it into the slot.
JOHANN
Any last minute requests?
ABE
(very quiet)
Do it, please. I - I'm ready for the real
world now.
Johann turns the cylinder. The tree roots form their arch...
and the BPRD team walks through.
165
On the other side of the tree: Manning and a bunch of agents
have set up spotter scopes and are gazing out over the
countryside, looking for them.
Suddenly, the team appears, literally from out of nowhere.
MANNING
(STARTLED)
Whoa! Where'd you come from? We were just-
BELLBOY
I know, here to help. Well, I appreciate
that Manning.
HELLBOY 2 112
Abe steps past Hellboy and removes his gunbelt and equipment
pack.
ABE
Yes, Mr. Manning. I want to thank you,
too. For all you've done for us over the
years.
He gives his stuff to the astonished agent.
MANNING
What? What, exactly is this?
ABE
(walking away)
I quit.
Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out the Samaritan and
shrugs off his pack, too.
MANNING
Come on. You're resigning?
HELLBOY
Looks that way, doesn't it?
Hellboy starts to leave, but spins around and takes his gun
back.
HELLBOY (CONT'D)
I think I'll keep this.
He finally meets Liz's gaze. She crosses to him and takes
him by the arm. She walks off with Hellboy and Abe, clinging
tightly to the big, red daemon.
MANNING
Liz -- not you, too!?
(to Johann)
They can't do this. Stop them, Johann-
JOHANN
Manning, you're an asshole.
Miles down the road, Abe stands on a promontory, staring off
at the ocean, which blazes with golden reflections.
Liz and HB sit next to each other on some mossy rocks.
Overhead: blue sky, puffy white clouds.
BELLBOY 2 113
LIZ
What you said before - about us living
ANYWHERE-
HELLBOY
I mean it! `Course, I'm thinking USA...
but, hey - you decide.
LIZ
(breathing deep)
Let's find a place in the country. Clean
air - green hills - fresh milk from the
farm.
HELLBOY
Milk? Yech.
LIZ
A yard... With lots of room to grow in.
HELLBOY
(he looks blank)
Grow? who gonna grow- ?
LIZ
Our baby, that's who!
HELLBOY
Our b-?
