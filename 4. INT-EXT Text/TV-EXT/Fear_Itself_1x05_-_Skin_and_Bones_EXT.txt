      It s cold.  Very cold.  All the mountains in the area are 
      wrapped in storm clouds.

      From here, we can see most of the surrounding Colorado 
      countryside, including the spectacular peaks of the Sangre De 
      Cristo mountains and the slopes of the Culebramountains.

      A MAIN HOUSE, with a huge porch that wraps around three sides 
    of the building.  A wide RANCH YARD with a BARN off to one 
      side and a COWHAND S BUNKHOUSE at the far end.

      It s cold enough outside to see your breath.  Cold enough 
      that it s hard to breathe.  Even so, two people stand on the 
      front porch, about as far apart as they can be while still 
      sharing the same porch.

      DEREK EDLUND.  17 years old, a tough kid.  The weight of the 
      world on his shoulders.

    TIM EDLUND, his brother, just two years younger, but a child 
    in most ways.  Developmentally challenged.  There s an open, 
      trusting innocence to Tim.

      They ve been outside for a while.  They re both freezing.

    The door to the house opens and their uncle, ROWDY EDLUND, 
      steps out.  

        Late-30s.Everything about him is rough-hewn, weathered.  
      Eyes wind-burnt into a permanent squint.  Skin tanned to 
      leather.

    One leg is in a cast.  Almost all the way up to the hip.  
      Rowdy s surprisingly mobile, but it definitely slows him 
      down, and he walks with a THUNK!on every other step.

                                  ROWDY
                    What are you doing?  Get inside.

      Neither of them budge.  Rowdy grabs Tim by the arm, starts to 
      pull him away.

                                  DEREK
                    Get your hands off him.

      Rowdy stops, glares down at Derek.                                                                                    2.



                                  ROWDY
                    Inside.  Now.

                                  DEREK
                    You can t tell us what to do.  This 
                    ain t your ranch.

                                  ROWDY
                    I can, and I am.

                                  DEREK
                    You ain t our daddy.  You just work 
                    for him, Uncle Rowdy.

                                  ROWDY
                    Don t have a thing to do with it.   
                    Wanna make yourselves sick so your 
                    momma s got more to worry about?

                                  TIM
                    Where s our dad?

                                  ROWDY
                    I don t know, Tim.

                                  DEREK
                    If you cared, you d be out there.

                                  ROWDY
                    Out where?  Marching around the 
                    mountains in the middle of a storm 
                    with no idea at all where to look?  
                    I wanna find him.  But I can t just 
                    go charging out there blind.

                                  DEREK
                    Well, in this weather, the sheriff 
                    ain t looking, either, so you tell 
                    me what is being done.  I heard a 
                    long list of what ain t.

      Derek takes Tim by the arm and Rowdy lets him go.

                                  DEREK
                          (to Tim)
                    Come on.  Let s go.

      Derek leads Tim inside, leaves Rowdy there on the porch.  

      Rowdy looks out at the desolate mountains, realizing what he 
      must do.                                                                                    3.




      Rowdy piles out of the house as fast as he can with the cast.  
      Elena follows him out onto the porch.

                                  ROWDY
                    Stay here.

      Rowdy heads out across the yard.  Grady marches along, 
      towards the house, slow but steady, staring straight ahead.  
    He doesn t seem to see Rowdy, even when he gets close.

      Grady s pale, gaunt.  Rowdy can t help but notice DRY BLOOD 
      smeared on his chin and neck.  Rowdy reaches out and touches 
    his arm, and Grady finally reacts.

    He flinches away, looks Rowdy in the eye, and opens his mouth 
    to scream.  What comes out, though, is ragged, strangled.

                                  ROWDY
                    Grady! It s me! It s Rowdy!

      Grady struggles to get away from him for a moment, but Rowdy 
      holds on, and after a moment, Grady seems to focus, suddenly 
      seeing his brother.  Grady collapses, exhausted.

      Derek and Tim step out onto the porch, see what s going on.  
      Elena tries to stop them from running out to their father.  
    She manages to grab Tim, but Derek heads down the steps.

      Rowdy looks down at Grady with his eyes rolled back in his 
      head, mouth open, tongue split and black.  Derek runs up, 
      sees his father and stops cold.

                                  DEREK
                    What the hell happened to him?


                                    END OF TEASER                                                                                    5.


                                        ACT ONE


      Someone walks across the yard of the ranch, bundled up.  
      Huge, imposing, moving with purpose.


      Eddie Bear stands on his porch, stares out at the ranch yard.

      A DEAD COW, slaughtered, lies frozen to the ground.

      Eddie looks up towards the main house.  Looks up at the 
      second floor windows to see --

    -- Grady.  Watching him.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    15.


                                        ACT TWO


      Derek knows Rowdy can t keep up, intentionally walks fast.

                                  ROWDY
                    Get back here!

      Derek turns on Rowdy, starts back towards him.                                                                                    16.



                                  DEREK
                    Where do you get off telling me 
                    anything?  My dad had to buy this 
                    ranch for you to run  cause you ve 
                    screwed up everything you ve ever 
                    touched, and he takes a loss on it 
                    every year just so you have a place 
                    to live.

      Rowdy steps in, grabs Derek by his shirtfront.

                                  ROWDY
                    Got a mouth on you, boy.

                                  DEREK
                    So do you.  Maybe you should keep 
                    it off my mother.

      Derek takes a swing at Rowdy, punching him in the face far 
      harder than either of them expects.  Rowdy rocks back a bit, 
    and Derek flinches, a little amazed by his actions.

      Rowdy pulls Derek close, wipes the blood from his lip, and 
      practically snarls at him.

                                  ROWDY
                    ... and a pretty decent right hook.  
                    You should be in there right now, 
                    trying to keep your mother happy, 
                    and instead, you re pickin fights 
                    with me when all I want to do is 
                    keep this place from falling apart.

                                  DEREK
                    I know what s goin on.  What s 
                    been goin on.  I see the way she 
                    looks at you.  You can fool Tim.  
                    But you can t fool me.

      They stare each other down for a long moment.

                                  DEREK
                    Be a whole lot easier if my dad 
                    just died, wouldn t it?

      Rowdy has no response.  He lets go of Derek, pushes him away.

                                  ROWDY
                    You don t know what you think you 
                    know, kid.

      Derek marches back into the house.                                                                                    17.




      Elena and the two boys cross the yard, quickly.

      Rowdy steps out the front door and follows close behind.


      Rowdy steps out, dreading what he s about to do.

      Elena also steps out of the bunkhouse, closes the door, and 
      walks up behind Rowdy.  She puts a hand on his back.                                                                                      27.



      When he doesn t turn around, she lays her head against his 
      back.  He still doesn t turn, staring at the house.

                                  ROWDY
                    Tell the boys the truth.  For me.  
                    When the time s right.  If I don t 
                    come back, I want them to know.  
                    Someday they ll understand.

      Before she can say anything, Rowdy walks away, marches across 
    the wide open ranch yard.

    He keeps his eyes on the main house as he approaches.  On the 
      windows upstairs.  Looking for anything.

      Elena heads back inside the bunkhouse.


      They stumble out onto the steps.

                                  TIM
                    What are we going to do now?

                                  DEREK
                    Mom s hurt bad.  There s no phone, 
                    so we have to leave.  Get off the 
                    mountain.  Bring help.  I ve got 
                    Rowdy s keys.  We can use his 
                    truck.

                                  TIM
                    Uncle Rowdy said we aren t supposed 
                    to drive his truck.  Ever.

                                  DEREK
                    ROWDY S DEAD, TIM! HE S DEAD! HE 
                    WON T CARE IF WE BORROW THE DAMN 
                    TRUCK! OKAY?!

      That shuts Tim up.

      Derek looks back in, at his father s body on the floor.  
      Knows how hard this has been on Tim, how insane this all is.

                                  DEREK
                    I m sorry.                                                                                    44.



                                  TIM
                    I don t mean to ask so many 
                    questions.  I m just...

                                  DEREK
                    Yeah, I know.  Me, too.  Let s go 
                    get the keys and Mom and get 
                    moving.  Okay?

    Tim glances back at their father one last time.

    The Wendigo is gone.

                                  TIM
                    Derek...

      WHAM!The Wendigo slams into Derek like a freight train.  
      Hits him hard enough to send the shotgun skittering off.

    The Wendigo grabs Derek with both hands and lifts him off the 
      ground, bringing him up to face him.

      There s nothing left of Grady now.  Whatever this thing is, 
      it s pure animal, pure anger.  Dangerous and awful and dying, 
    the skin around its mouth already rotten and decayed.

    It starts to shake the living shit out of Derek.

    As it roars again, opening its mouth to take a bite out of 
      Derek s neck --

    -- the barrel of the shotgun is suddenly jammed up all the 
    way to the back of the Wendigo s mouth --

    -- by Elena.

    She pumps the shotgun, tears in his eyes.

                                  ELENA
                    You re not my husband.


      BLAM!The blast echoes like thunder.


    The Wendigo s on the ground.  Finally dead.  No question.

      Elena and her boys take a moment to catch their breath as the 
      wind kicks up around them.

      Derek sits up, in great pain.  Tim helps him to his feet.                                                                                    45.



      They look at their mother, who hasn t moved at all.  She just 
      stands there holding the shotgun on Grady s body.

      Derek puts his hand on the gun.  She won t let it go at 
      first, but he finally manages to take it from her.

                                  DEREK
                    It s over.


      Derek puts the truck in gear and starts to drive off.  And as 
    the vehicle disappear into the darkness, there s a sound.  
      Very faint, but definitely there, just at the edge of 
      hearing, carried on the wind.

    The distant sound of a Wendigo s cry.

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK
