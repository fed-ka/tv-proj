
      We're on the street outside the Daily Planet.  The street's 
      been closed off to vehicular traffic because there's a 
      street fair going on.  It's a Daily Planet-sponsored charity 
      fund raiser.  We find LOIS and CLARK at a cotton candy 
      stand.  Clark pays for two cotton candies, hands one to 
      Lois, who looks at it askance.

                                     LOIS
                     My parents wouldn't let me have
                     these.

                                     CLARK
                     Ever?  You've never had cotton
                     candy?

      They're moving now, walking slowly along the line of booths 
      and attractions.  Beyond them is a bandstand.  No musicians 
      yet; workmen are setting up the amps and the large
      instruments.

                                     LOIS
                          (quoting her father)
                     'The girl's hyperactive enough,
                     Ellen.  Don't feed her dyed                       (X)

      They come into range of JIMMY.

                                     JIMMY
                     Step right up, folks.  One dollar,
                     one measly dollar to learn your
                     future.  Madame Blavatsky knows
                     all, sees all, tells all.

                                     LOIS
                          (ragging him)
                     How much of my dollar goes to
                     charity?

                                     PERRY (O.S.)
                     Olsen!

                     Is that Lois I hear?

      PERRY, aka Madame Blavatsky, sticks his head out of the tent
      opening.  Makeup, diaphanous scarves.  He holds up one 
      hand, from which garishly colored fake fingernails dangle. 

                                     PERRY (CONT'D)
                          (to Lois)
                     How do you keep these things from 
                     falling off?  Why in thunder do you 
                     women do this to yourselves?

      He disappears back into the tent.  Lois hands her cotton 
      candy to Clark.

                                     LOIS
                     You'll be here when I come back 
                     out, right?  You're not having a 
                     sudden urge to return a video or 
                     put money in the meter or buy new 
                     shoelaces, are you?

                     Lois!  Get in here!

      Lois disappears into the tent to deal with the peevish 
      Madame Blavatsky's fingernails.  Clark and Jimmy gaze 
      silently at the closed tent flap, then Jimmy grabs Clark's 
      arm and gets intense:

                                     JIMMY
                          (softly)
                     This is your idea of a date?  You 
                     think Scardino takes her to silly 
                     street fairs and buys her cotton 
                     candy?

                                     CLARK
                     I don't care what Scardino does.

      DAN SCARDINO has come up behind them.

      He and Clark square off.

                     She's with me.

      Clark looks kind of silly standing there holding two cotton 
      candies.  Dan smiles.  He _likes_ competition.

                                     DAN

                     Yeah.

      They're sort of nose to nose.  At this moment Lois emerges 
      from the tent, stops on seeing them.  She looks from one to 
      the other of them.

                                     DAN
                     Like a date?

                     Yeah.  Like a date.  Where she and 
                     I are together for a certain amount 
                     of time doing stuff with each other 
                     as a couple.  Where she's with me
                     and I'm with her.

      At this unfortunate moment, we HEAR:

                                     VOICE
                          (panicky)
                     Look out!  Oh, my God!  Look out!

      They all look in the direction of:


   2  THE BANDSTAND                                                   2   

      where a huge amp, elevated above the platform, is teetering,
      about to fall to the stage below.  Directly beneath it is
      CALVIN DREGG, guitarist, a legend in his own mind.  He has
      on earphones, which are connected to his electric guitar,
      which he's tuning.  He's oblivious.

      away.

      SUPERMAN whisks Calvin Dregg out of harm's way just as the
      amp crashes to the stage, right where Calvin was standing.


   5  BEHIND THE BANDSTAND                                            5   

      Superman floats down to the ground, sets Calvin down.
      Calvin seems dazed. Superman looks him over.

                                     SUPERMAN
                     I'm glad I was nearby.

      He's eager to leave, but now a woman, ELISE CARR, comes
      running up to them.  She's clearly distraught, near tears.
      Superman can't leave just yet.

                                     ELISE
                     Oh, thank you, Superman.  Oh,
                     Calvin, Calvin!  Thank God!  Are
                     you okay?

                                     SUPERMAN
                     He's a little dazed, miss, but
                     he'll be fine.

      Superman starts to leave again, but:

                                     CALVIN
                          (to Superman)
                     Fine?  Fine?!
                          (to Elise)
                     He broke my hand, Elise!  Just when
                     I get my big break in show
                     business, this baboon busts my

                     Take me to the hospital right now,
                     I mean it!

      Superman blinks.  Try to be nice, what does it get you?

      Lois and Dan are standing where we left them.  Presumably
      they've been watching the drama at the bandstand.  Now they
      turn back toward the booth.  Lois registers that Clark's not
      there.

                                     LOIS

                     He probably had a good reason.

                     tried to make him look bad.

                     solves everything.  Because you 
                     won't talk to me about your work.

                     you're going to be fine.

      Calvin turns his whining invective on Elise.

                                     CALVIN
                     You don't understand anything!
                     You're a waitress, for God's sake!
                     You serve slabs of dead cows to fat
                     businessmen.  You wouldn't know                   (X)

      Though Elise probably hears this crap seventeen times a day,
      it still has the power to wound.  She looks like she might
      cry.  Superman intervenes:

                                     SUPERMAN
                     People who love each other should
                     be kind to each other.

                                     CALVIN
                     What are you, a greeting card on                  (X)

                     I've never been sorry I saved
                     anyone's life, Mr. Dregg.  I'd hate
                     to start now.

      Clark appears at the street fair.  It's over.  There's

      Actually, it's not Calvin's house, since Calvin has no way
      to pay rent, since Calvin is too artistically pure to take a
      job for mere money.  It's Elise's house.  Calvin is sitting
      in a chair by the window, watching TV.  He's suffering, and
      not in silence, as he scratches the itch underneath his cast
      with a long skinny stick.

      Lois and Clark are appalled. Calvin is very excited.

                                     CALVIN
                     There I am! There I am! I'm so
                     photogenic!

                          (oily sincerity)
                     We tried to contact Superman to
                     hear his side of the story...
                          (he's lying)
                     ... but The Man of Steel apparently
                     feels he's not answerable to
                     anyone.  Well, we'll see if he's
                     answerable to the law.

                                     ELISE
                     You look good on TV, Calvin.

      The TV Calvin has started talking, and Elise is talking over
      him.

                                     CALVIN
                     Shhh! Shhh!

                                     CALVIN (T.V.)
                     According to the doctor my attorney
                     found for me, I have permanent
                     nerve damage, I'll never play the
                     guitar again.

      GROANS of sympathy from the audience.  Lois is watching the
      TV, her head turned away from Clark, who has had just about
      all of Calvin Dregg that he can take.

                                     CALVIN (T.V.)
                     And Superman didn't even apologize.

      That's it.  Clark lowers his glasses and aims his HEAT
      VISION at the TV, which sizzles, pops and dies.  Calvin is
      beside himself, and of course, he blames Elise.

                     We had a _date_, Clark.  And you
                     just disappeared and you never
                     came back.

      Trapped.  Trapped like a fly in a sticky web.  At this
      moment, we hear, from somewhere O.S., a faintish SQUEAL OF
      BRAKES.  Clark reacts.  If Clark Kent were capable of
      saying, "Oh, shit!!" -- now would be the time.

                                     CLARK

      Superman stands there looking harassed and powerless.



      Lois goes from apoplexy to cold fury.  She snags a passing

      returns, looks around.  The waiter hands him the note and

      Superman LANDS and walks up the steps.  There is a commotion
      at the doors, a PHALANX of REPORTERS and LAWYERS exiting.
      The crowd breaks and Superman sees at the center of it:

      BILL CHURCH, JR., in the middle of giving a statement to the
      press:

                     Superman!

      He moves to him.  Press people follow, cameras CLICKING.

                                     SUPERMAN
                     Don't tell me you made bail.

                                     BILL, JR.
                     Bail?  No. They're dropping the
                     charges.

                                     SUPERMAN

      He smiles, pats him on the shoulder and moves off, talking 
      to the Press:

                                     BILL, JR. (CONT'D)
                     I just signed to write a book on
                     the whole experience, called WHY
                     THIS IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON
                     EARTH...

      Superman just shakes his head and moves into the court.



      Superman comes out fast, takes a deep breath, moves to a 
      bench and sits, exhausted.  A LITTLE GIRL walks up.

                                     GIRL
                     You look sad, Superman.

                                     SUPERMAN
                     I'm okay.

                                     GIRL
                     Want a hug?

      He nods.  She loops her arms around his neck and gives him a 
      squeeze and a peck on the cheek.  Then --

      MUSIC BACK UP as they move up her stoop and into her
      building WE WIDEN TO REVEAL Superman across the street, in
      the shadows, as his face sets, more sad than angry, and he
      takes off.

      Knox with a well-dressed ASSASSIN, both kneeling in front of
      an open attache case.

                                     ASSASSIN
                     It's silent, no moving parts, just
                     two globs of liquid C-12,                         (X)
                     separated by this little piece of
                     plastic.  Start your acid eating
                     through and in five minutes,                      (X)
                     whammo.  Always wanted to try this                (X)
                     little sucker... right under
                     Superman's nose.

      We see what's in the attache case now: a high-tech bomb.
      The Assassin closes the case and locks it.

                                     KNOX
                     Just remember, it can't look like
                     Scardino and Lane were the only
                     targets...

                                     ASSASSIN
                     It won't.                                         (X)

      They move out of the park, toward the court house.
