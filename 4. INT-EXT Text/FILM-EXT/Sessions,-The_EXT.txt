SUBTITLE Berkeley, California -1981-
DISSOLVE TO ACTUAL TV NEWS FOOTAGE FROM 1981
A busy intersection near the UC Berkeley campus. A strange,
self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes
its way over a pedestrian crosswalk. The passenger, MARK
O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up.
The rest of him is covered by a blanket. He operates the
gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned
around his head.
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
Mark O'Brien has been going to UC
Berkeley since 1978. That's O'Brien
in the motorized gurney heading for
class last week.
The gurney continues along a leafy promenade on the campus.
Passers-by just go about their normal business.
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
He had polio when he was 6 years
old. The disease left his body
crippled but his mind remained
sharp and alert, and since he
wanted to be a writer, Mark O'Brien
entered Cal to major in English and
learn his trade.
We hear a voice reciting a verse of poetry as we follow Mark
in his contraption.
MARK (V.O.)
Graduation
Today I hear the crowd's applause
Receive congratulations from my
friends
Today I ask if I've found a place
among the rest
I hope you see a man upon this
stage
Who studied...read..wrote, and
passed the test
In cap and gown, diploma on my
chair
THE SCENE CHANGES to the interior of a large auditorium. A
graduation ceremony is in progress.
Suddenly, everyone in
the hall, GRADUATES, their FAMILIES, ACADEMICS and OTHERS,
rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the
stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles.
1A.
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
And so, Mark O'Brien graduates from
Cal, one of 250 English majors to
receive degrees today.
2.
The DEAN steps forward, congratulates Mark and places a
diploma on his blanket. The gurney makes its way across the
rest of the stage to thunderous applause.
THE SCENE CHANGES BACK to the campus exterior. The news
reporter talks to camera.
NEWS REPORTER
If this report tells us anything,
it is that a disability is not
necessarily a handicap.
In the background, Mark's family and friends are gathered
round him in a jubilant mood.
NEWS REPORTER (CONT'D)
Mark O'Brien teaches us that
courage and perseverance overcome
obstacles.

It is about 4.00 a.m. All is quiet. We follow a mean-looking

It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in
through a partially-opened window.

Joan pushes Mark along in a gurney, similar, but slightly
different from the one in the news clip. There are no mirrors
and no motor, just an oxygen tank, a tube and a mouthpiece
just next to Mark's mouth. Most of him is covered with a
colorful blanket. The whole thing is a sports-coupe version
of his iron lung.
JOAN
Would you mind if I asked you a
favor?
MARK
You need help moving furniture?
She has no apparent sense of humor.
JOAN
I need an advance on my pay, like
two weeks. That's not a big ask, is
it?
Mark looks rightfully shocked.
MARK
What if you don't last another two
weeks?
4A.
He gives her a look, and means it. We hear his thoughts.
MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Joan never failed to put me in a
crappy mood. It was also a drag
that I was no longer allowed to use
my other gurney, the self-propelled
one. It had caused a couple of
spectacular accidents.

With her boyfriend and another

Amanda is clearly paying more attention to Mark than to Matt.
MARK (V.O.)
What did the boyfriend think?
That I was in his way?
I'm always in somebody's way, I
thought, the sun in my eyes.

We sense Mark's deep satisfaction as he closes his eyes and
the sun warms his face.

Vera says nothing. She rings the bell again.

My God, she's forgotten, or she's
gotten the date wrong. Okay, we
might as well turn round and go
back. Come on, let's go.

overcomes her.

VERA
How do you feel?
MARK
Cleansed and victorious.
VERA
Doesn't get any better than that.
MARK
Tell me about your first sexual
experience.
VERA
Let me think. It wasn't all that
pleasant. I mean, it was consensual
and everything, and I really was in
love with the guy, but his dick
seemed enormous to me, I didn't
think it would fit. It was scary.
But he was nice. I guess he
couldn't help it.
MARK
Was he Chinese?
VERA
Are you kidding? I only hung out
with white guys at high school.
MARK
Why is that?
VERA
I don't know. To stick it to my mum
and dad, I suppose.
MARK
Are they happy now you've got a
Chinese boyfriend?
VERA
They're happy. I'm happy.
MARK
What's his dick like?
VERA
Perfect size.
MARK
Why do you call it a dick instead
of a penis?
41.
VERA
Penis sounds like some vegetable
you don't want to eat. Dick sounds
like what it is.
They continue in silence for a little while.
MARK
The thing is, it was all over so
damn quickly.

Yes, tell me about it.

ROD
What's on the menu today?
43.
MARK
We're attempting intercourse.
ROD
Uh-huh. That's a big one.
MARK
What do you think of it?
Intercourse.
ROD
Overrated, but necessary. There's
plenty of other ways of achieving
the same result, but somehow you
don't feel you've actually done it
till you've gone all the way in.
This does not help Mark's state of mind.

MARK
Could you put my cup right on the

the straw in my mouth, please?
WAITER
Sure.
The waiter does exactly as asked.
WAITER (CONT'D)
Is that okay?
MARK
Perfect.
WAITER
Sir, I'd wait a couple of minutes.
That coffee is pretty hot.
MARK
Thanks.
WAITER
You're welcome.
The waiter leaves. Mark and Cheryl look at each other.
CHERYL
So, what shall we talk about?
MARK
We don't have to do much talking.
Cheryl smiles at him. She is looking gorgeous today.
CHERYL
Then why are we here?
MARK
I just want to be seen with you in
public. I find that as sexy as
anything we've done so far.
He sips on his coffee and soaks her in with his eyes.

CHERYL
I'm glad you enjoy looking, after
all.
MARK
I want people to say "Who's the guy
with the blonde? How did he get so
lucky?"
CHERYL
Or so rich.
MARK
Okay, if some old girlfriend from
school you hadn't seen for years
turned up suddenly, like right now,
how would you introduce me? As your
boyfriend?
CHERYL
No, as my husband. Why not go all
the way.
MARK
Really?
CHERYL
Does that shock you?
MARK
Yes.
CHERYL
Then I guess it would shock her as
well.
MARK
Who?
CHERYL
My old school friend that's going
to come along any moment.
MARK
You really can picture me as

winds down. Vera hands Cheryl an envelope with money in it.
At first, Cheryl just looks at it, then realizes what it is.

You forgot this.
Cheryl smiles.
