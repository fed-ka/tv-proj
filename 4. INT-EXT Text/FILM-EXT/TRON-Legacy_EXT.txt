CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE
TRON leaps out blast hole, recovers his disk, vanishes into
ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE.
Rx23 roars after him, riding hard, joined by:
Airborne SEARCH ENGINE vehicle, piloted by a dumpy nerd
program called KROD.
KROD
I got a lock. Coordinate 32937!
RX23
I'm on him!
RX23 chases Tron into a dark canyon. Hairpin turns and blind
curves. RX23 arrives a junction. Tron has vanished.
RX23
Which way did he go?!

CYBERSPACE - THE OLD GAME GRID
Vast, low-rez, uncool, largely forgotten.
TRON pulls a LIGHT WAND from his legging, grips it. A TURBO-
CHARGED LIGHT-CYCLE rezzes up beneath him. He fires his
LIGHTCYCLE. ZIP, he's gone.
Onto the grid blasts RX23, speeding on his Pulse rider.
He
skids and swerves, learning the funky surface.
Search Engine flies onto the scene, hovering overhead.
KROD
Coordinate 6532.02!
There he goes!
The chase is on.
TRON escapes across the vast grid-plane, head down, eyes
hollow. He gains speed, retreating to somewhere...
RX23 surges on his Pulse Rider, closing the gap.

Staff defers to: GORDON SINCLAIR (45), boyish, ruthless,
brilliant CEO of Encom Corporation.
SINCLAIR
Delay the press until 8:30. I'll
taking the stage at 8:50. Force a

He catches something on a video screen, snaps his fingers.
SINCLAIR
Play that again.
Crew murmurs on headsets.

VIDEO PLAYBACK
X-Net deploys radical software design,
constructs proprietary white-hot
firewalls, unleashes virus killer
apps. Creating the most secure data
network in history. Your data can
never again be hacked, corrupted,
stolen or destroyed. X-Net is the
final solution, totally guaranteed
99.999% secure data transmission -
SINCLAIR
Who changed that? Who put "99.999"?
X-Net executives chill.
PR VP
Um, that would be...
Legal.
Eyes land on withering LEGAL VP.
SINCLAIR
Change it back to the way I wrote
it. With the launch of X-Net, this
company guarantees one hundred percent
secure data transmission. If we
can't deliver on that promise, we
deserve to be out of business.
Rush appears from a building.

Min-blowing cyberspace fly-over.
DATA BEAM penetrates a towering shaft, reaching deep inside
the MASSIVELY FORTIFIED X-NET CENTRAL SERVER.

CYBERSPACE TRANSITION
Light-speed thrill-ride, hurling into digital chaos.
Rush's electrified body hurtles across the void, eyes filled
with TERROR and AWE.
TRANSFORMS TO:

CYBERSPACE - X-NET CENTRAL SERVER
Shimmering bits morph into an awesome cyberscape.
Rush enters this bizarre world - CRASH/FLASH - stranger in a
strange land. Data energy ZAPS off his body, interacting
with the landscape circuitry around him. He fights it, tries
to control it.

Rush stands, beholds the place. Looks at his hands and arms,
clad in circuitry. He finds he had landed outside:
Fortress-like X-NET CENTRAL SERVER.
ALARMS SOUNDING inside.
He turns, looks up a FIREWALL. Hundreds of X-Takk Troops
hurry to look down. FIRING WEAPONS.
A FIGURE comes at him, down the wall, STREAKING RED.
BLAMMO!
TRON lands on a plateau above Rush, gazing down.
They face each other, equally perplexed.
Rush is no longer human, but not quite a program either.
Energy zaps off his body, infusing the surrounding circuitry.
Tron stares, unblinking - Cyber-Ninja.
RUSH
It's YOU!
The intruder!
Rush's body circuits PULSE with anger - data surges out his
feet, across floor circuitry, up to the plateau. Energy
interacts with Tron's body circuits, siphoning off bits of
code.
Code races across Rush's eyes.
Identification data.
RUSH
You are...
TRON?!?
X-Takks hustle onto the scene.
Tron leaps off the plateau, cutting the data connection.
He
whips his disk off his back and THROWS.
Disk SLAMS Rush in the gut, knocks him flat.
RUSH
ARRRGHH!
X-Takks pursue Tron -
Tron recovers his disk - vanishes in an OUTBOUND DATA STREAM,
losing his pursuers.
X-Takks pull Rush to his feet, shocked.

RX23 reboot was not authorized!
Pushing through Police: A sleek, smart cyber-babe MEGA.
(She's Meg's cyber-twin: Twice the edge, half the patience,
all the curves.)
Rush is awed by the sight of her.
RUSH
Yow.
I know who programmed you.
MEGA
I am Mega, X-Net Intelligence.
RUSH
Mega.
Cool.
I am -
MEGA
A spy? Posing as RX23? Under which
register were you rebooted?
RUSH
I'm a User.
Mega and X-Takks look at him like he's crazy.
MEGA
Detain this impostor.
X-Takks move to seize Rush.
RUSH
No wait, look. We're on the same
side here. I got an ID on the
intruder!
Mega touches Rush, exciting his energy flow.

HUB CITY
Electro-pop overload. Rush and Mega squeeze through crowds,
past screaming data pipes and sizzling circuitry.
City is dominated by mugshots of TRON:
"ENEMY OF THE FUTURE"
Mega locates a gleaming X-NET KIOSK. A PROMOTER (KROD)
extoles the virtues of the X-Net system:
KROD
Three more hub cities have been
attacked by viruses!

But X-Net opens soon! You will travel

Heeey!
RUSH

This guy can filter a river of junk
data and pull out the good stuff.
KROD
You know it, dude!
Krod smiles big at Mega, refers to Rush:
KROD
Who is this guy?
Rush pulls Krod aside.
RUSH
Miles - I mean Krod, you flew the
search engine. You ran a trace on a
hotshot lightcycle rider. The red
guy. Remember?
KROD
Well. Eh. I'd like to help you,
but truth is, I just got rebooted
from a big crash. There's nothing
left in my memory from before.
He taps his head.
MEGA
This will yield zero.
RUSH
Hang on.
Rush thinks, touches a surface. Concentrates. Circuitry
zaps from data coming off his hands. Connections illuminate,
data races around walls and floors.
Programs stop what they're doing, amazed by the feat.

Mega is astonished - and privately worried.
Rush's data flow illuminates surfaces with images from HIS
memory - the opening light cycle race.
RUSH
Remember, Krod? You were watching
this lightcycle duel, a red guy and
a green guy, head-to-head.
Krod gawks at the image, but he's stumped.
RUSH
The green guy faked out the red guy,
but the red guy double-faked the
green guy.
Bingo.
KROD
Okay! YES! And the green guy
splattered big time! It was awesome!
How could I forget that?!
Splat happens in Rush's memory image.
All goes white.
RUSH
Where did the red guy go after that?
You didn't crash right away.
KROD
He escaped out this hidden exit -
Krod's points to another screen.
"Wanted" image of Tron.
KROD
THAT GUY!
The RED GUY!
RUSH
Did you jack his coordinate?
KROD
Tr165444.018!
They slap high fives.
Krod double-takes on Rush.

KROD
Yeah! Whatever. You're good. How'd

RUSH
It's complicated. You're coming

going to find Tron and shut him down.
KROD
Beats working.
They head out.
Krod falls in beside Mega, impressed by her.
KROD
Hey babe.
Did I ever know you?
35
ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM I/O PORT
Rush, Krod and Mega head deep into an obsolete, abandoned
region of low-rez circuitry.
KROD
The old game grid is this way -
He spins. Rush and Mega aren't behind him. They've climbed
inside a defunct I/O Port: Like a retro-tech temple.
RUSH
How do I uplink to the real world?
MEGA
The real world doesn't exist. Nobody
can uplink. These ports were for
simulation only.
RUSH
Right... But how did those poor
misguided fools boot up the link?
MEGA
They stood in the center.
Held their
disk above their head.
Rush pulls his disk off his back, aims it skyward.
Concentrates. Energy flows off his feet, interacts with the
I/O Port floor.
RUBY COMMUNICATION BEAM shoots skyward.
36
CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT I/O PORT
Rush raises his disk, beaming data into the great unknown.
Smiles as he downloads the response.
Mega and Krod watch nearby.
RUSH
I identified the intruder.
I/O PORT walls ZAP ENERGY, STRESSING Rush's CONNECTION -

CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT I/O PORT - MORNING
Text forms in magenta circuitry - GOOD WORK PARTNER.
RUSH
I have a plan to crash Tron.
Mega turns with alarm.
MEGA
ABORT!
Walls THUNDER and CRASH IN -
Rush leaps clear with his disk -
MASSIVE ROMBALL (data reformatting orb) hurtles around the
I/O Port, ZAPPING all it touches, de-rezzing data structures
into neutral gray "blank matter".
ROMBALL loops skyward.
GIANT D-REZZ PROGRAM crashes down from above, retrieves
ROMBALL - He's ENORMOUS, TOUGH, SINGLE-MINDED.
41
ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM I/O PORT
D-Rezz screams like a modem, hurls ROMBALL -
Mega and Krod dive clear -
ROMBALL misses them, but BLAZES DOWN two more I/O Ports.
D-
rezz retrieves ROMBALL, bears down on Mega and Krod.
RUSH
Hey! Double points if you nail me!
Bring it on!
D-Rezz turns his ugly sights on Rush, baited away from Mega
and Krod.
D-rezz flexes and ROARS, revealing an X-NET LOGO on his chest.
RUSH
Stop!
End your routine!
D-rezz corners Rush, hurls his ROMBALL - Ball fires every
circuit in its path, bleaching away data energy.
Rush dodges -
RUSH
Cease!
Desist! We're on the same
team!
Mega throws her disk, plings D-rezz on the skull.
D-rezz
turns on her -
Rush runs, LEAPS on D-Rezz's back.
Like riding a gorilla -
D-Rezz flips Rush to the ground, pins him with one mighty
hand, raises his ROMBALL for the kill.
RUSH
I'm X-Net too!
Data flows from Rush's body, up D-Rezz's clamping arm.
Radiant energy between predator and prey.
Digits race in D-rezz's eyes. A code unlocks. He looks
down, finally registering the X-Net markings on Rush's outfit.
D-Rezz lets go of Rush, slumps back on his haunches.
Lowers

RUSH
No, hey, hey big guy, don't take it
so hard. We all have bad days.

D-rezz hears this, happy to be understood.
(He never talks.)
KROD
Easy, big guy. No harm, no foul.
RUSH
D-Rezz, we can use a guy with your
raw power. You ready to be a hero
for X-Net?
D-Rezz stands, clutches his ROMBALL.
Reporting for duty.
KROD
Cool. Now I've got somebody I can
boss around.
D-rezz modem-growls at Krod.
KROD
Or not.
RUSH
Let's get to the game grid.
Rush leads them up an incline.
MEGA
(grudgingly, to Rush)
You have a skill for manipulating
other programs.
RUSH
When do I get a shot at hacking your
code?
MEGA
Never. Our operating systems are

GAME PORTAL OUTPOST
Obsolete, abandoned computer game entry portal, guarding
entry to the old game grid beyond. An electro-tech carnival
zone gone dark. No life in sight... Then:
Beam of DATA ENERGY sling-shots at ground level, solidifying
to become:
A slender, jumpy Program called I-BEEM. He wears the X-Net
logo and a cracked disk on his back. He's highly unstable
and way unplugged from the system (like one of those Japanese
soldiers still fighting alone in the hills 10 years after
WWII was over).
I-Beem sees something - he PANICS, zapping away in
characteristic streaks of airborne data. He reassembles in
a hiding place, skittish, observing:
Rush, Mega, Krod and D-Rezz arrive. See GIANT PILE of GAME
VEHICLE PARTS blocking access to the grid.
Rush picks up an old LIGHT WAND.
Krod finds one too.
RUSH
D-rezz.
Cut a path.
D-Rezz hurls his Romball, ZAPS into VEHICLE PARTS.
A dent.
KROD
That's good.
Keep doing it.
D-rezz retrieves Romball for another whack -
ZAP -
DATA ENERGY BEAM snaps in front of them, becoming I-
Beem.
He grips his rickety disk, challenging them.
I-BEEM
Violation!
Go away!
Access denied!
RUSH
Relax, buddy -
Mega scans I-beem.
He freaks, drops his disk, grabs for it.
KROD
Pound him to bits, D-rezz.

D-Rezz raises his Romball to pulverize I-Beem.
I-Beem freaks, ZAPS away in his data beam as Romball crashes
down. I-Beem reforms further way, then beside them - He
snatches his pancake disk, the zaps away again, emerging
then high on the pile of parts.
RUSH
He's wireless.
KROD
Freaky.
MEGA
Searching data bank. "I-Beem".
Security Specialist, damaged in
service, rated unstable.
I-BEEM
(ranting from above)
"Unstable"! Like they aren't?!
They booted me off X-Net! I'll show
them! I'm doing my subroutine out
here! Nobody gets through this
portal!
He kicks parts - avalanche fills the gap D-rezz blasted.
KROD
D-rezz, take out this blip.
D-rezz cocks Romball. I-Beem freaks, sling-shots all over
the place via his data beam, tossing his wobbly disk.
Rush catches I-Beem's disk.
Holds off D-Rezz.
RUSH
Hang on. I-Beem. We're from X-Net
CPU. You're doing a great job out
here. Everybody knows it.
Mega throws Rush a look.
I-beem comes up, grateful.
I-BEEM
They do?!
RUSH
That's right. Now, have you seen a
rogue Program around here? He's
red. Super fast. Known as "Tron".
Data zags to Rush, forming into: I-Beem.
Wide-eyed.

RUSH
When did he come through last?
I-BEEM
Right before you got here.
Rush trades looks with Mega, Krod and D-Rezz.
Trail is hot.
RUSH
I-beem, we've got a plan to shut
down that red violator. You're going
to help us.
I-BEEM
Let me at him!
RUSH
First, you've got to let us onto the
game grid.
I-Beem stiffens, reflexively vigilant. He scans the four of
them again, finally softening. He zaps to a wall near his
giant barrier, then proudly pushes aside a thin panel. Beyond
a corridor of game gear, view expanses to reveal:
44
OLD GAME GRID
Rush steps across the vast vector-graphic grid surface.
Eerie.
Quiet.
Pure.
Mega, I-Beem, Krod and D-rezz follow.
MEGA
This region is obsolete.
Rush kneels, touches grid lines.
Circuits energize, as his
energy surges in all directions.
He draws in data.
RUSH
There's bits of Tron's code all over.
Krod, give D-Rezz and I-beem the

You only get one shot at this, big
guy. Stop him but don't destroy
him, right? He's got data I need.
D-rezz grips Romball, grunts affirmation.
He and I-beem
head for the perimeter of the grid.
MEGA
If this is Tron's territory, he'll
know we're here. He'll hide.
RUSH
He can't resist a grudge match.
He'll take risks trying to beat me.
That's how we trip him up.
(to Krod)
Whip it out.
Rush unsheathes his LIGHT WAND.
Krod pulls out his own LIGHT WAND.
They both look at Mega.
She's got no light wand.
KROD
You didn't bring one?
MEGA
I don't have one.
KROD
Hey, not a problem -
Krod holds his light wand forward, activates it.

MEGA
Mmmm...
Hack me.
A nod between Rush and Rush - they TAKE OFF.
LIGHT CYCLES shoot across grid surface.
Mega screams and clutches Rush, throwing her body against
his, clamping her arms around him.
Krod and Rush turn 90 degrees, rallying, passing each other,
getting warmed up. It's familiar territory.
Light cycles race toward each other on the same line.
Mega holds Rush tight, eyes filling with terror.
MEGA
Resource conflict!
Fatal crash

But Krod and Rush slow their light cycles with expert skill,
rolling safely to a halt, nose-to-nose. Directly over:
A BIG RED DOT.
The only dot on the grid.
Grid Center.
Mega, Rush and Krod raise up to scan the horizon.
It's all

Glowing code numbers mark the end of each grid line.
D-rezz grunts, points.
One lights up "Tr165444.018"
They follow the line off the grid, where it leads into a

Rush, Mega and Krod wait on their light cycles.
MEGA

box around them.
RUSH
Remember the plan, Krod. Don't bail

ROCKY EDGE looms closer.
RUSH
Wuss!
You call that speed!?
Rush kicks in a hyper-burner, surging forward.
Krod does

KROD
Hey, what are you - ??
Tron sees the bail-out, knows something's wrong. He looks
ahead, sees D-rezz astride his crevasse escape root, rom-
ball poised in the air.
Tron bails out 90 degrees, cutting behind Krod.
Krod turns
twice, ending up in Tron's lane.
To the side, Rush's light cycle screams toward solid rock,
vibrating out of control.
Rush grabs Mega and JUMPS OFF.
They slide on the grid,

Krod's lightcycle heads for the rock escape passage.
KROD
No!
It's ME!
Rush and Mega slide to a halt, in time to see:
Their light cycle SMASHES rocks, explodes in a million bits.
RUSH
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!
MEGA

I GOT SCARED!
Krod shoots gap.
D-rezz is ready to smash him with his
Romball.
I-BEEM
No!
It's Krod! Tron is OVER THERE!
D-rezz makes mental switch, hurls Romball.
Romball bounces down solid rock, onto game grid, rolls with
ferocious speed, DIAGONALLY across the grid.
Romball curves to track Tron - like a great bowling shot.
Romball clips rear wheel of Tron's lightcycle.

(to Rush...)
I hired Sinclair as Encom's business
guy, so I could do the dreaming.
Right off, he wanted to "capture the
market" on data transmission. Had
this plan called "X-Net", based on
flawless efficiency, hyperlock
security, encryption protocol
uniformity. Blah blah. I was the
boss, I told him to forget it. I
knew it could go bad. But the guy
had trouble taking no for an answer.
He arranged for my lab to melt down.
Sinclair took over my company and
put X-Net on a fast-track. And here's
where it's brought us.
City descends into panic. X-Takk Troops evict Programs,
seize prisoners and mercilessly hunt down resistors.
X-Net Construction Crews build the Optik Highway with
relentless precision, blasting aside the old city's splendid
structures.
RUSH
What are they doing??
FLYNN
Beating the competition.
X-Takk Troops storm closer - by the hundreds.
MEGA
They've got us outnumbered.
FLYNN
We've got to choose our battles
wisely. This way!
He leads them down a secret portal, into:

59
REAL WORLD CITY - DUSK
Like any other day. Except a high-rise building's lights
flicker off. A subway escalator stops. A traffic light
turns red on both sides. Cars honk, tempers flare.
A TV store: All TVs in the window flip to one channel, which
happens to be running a commercial for X-Net - theme: Total
Data Security".
61
REAL WORLD - BANK - DUSK
ATM machine goes berserk.
63
REAL WORLD - STREET - DUSK
Block full of Pedestrians suddenly - and simultaneously -
can't get their cell phones to work.

REAL WORLD - SUV MOVING - DUSK
GPS navigation system map flips around.
GPS VOICE
Turn left now. Turn right now.
Left. Right. NOW!
SUV Driver panics, pulls a hard turn and SMASHES a BUS.

CYBERSPACE - SECRET X-NET PROCESSOR
RUSH
Sinclair betrayed me.
FLYNN
Finally you get it.
MEGA
Tron was our late hope.
RUSH
We've got to stop this!
X-Takks hear Rush's shouts.
An overwhelming force.
Flynn and Mega shove Rush into a tunnel, closing the portal -

X-NET CENTRAL SERVER - EVENING
X-Takk Troops sound alert.
Outside the main portal, energy zaps and splinters above
ground circuits, collecting to become:
I-beem, reforming, running, stumbling.
Some body parts out

hustle deeper.
79
CLASSIC DATA HUB CITY
X-Net Cruisers crash the city.
Programs scatter.
Plexor commands Lead Cruiser, sweeps Q-MINATOR. Running
Civilian Programs are rendered "naked" by the beam, bodies

FIGHTER HIDE-OUT / DATA PIPE
Rush, Mega and Flynn, pursued, rendezvous with Krod, Boole
and Quantz.
BOOLE
This way!
Down the pipe!
Rush helps Krod, Quantz and Boole into a data pipe.
One by
one, they WHIRL away in the flow of chromatic data.
Flynn and Mega have a breathless moment to consider Rush.
MEGA
He's better than I thought.
FLYNN
He's been sent for a reason.
MEGA
What reason?
FLYNN
Don't know yet. Sometimes we have
to trust the bigger plan.
Mega struggles to compute.
Rush turns to help Flynn down the pipe. Mega assists.
Flynn's wounded leg gives out, he slips. Rush holds him,
but loses his balance, slides down.
RUSH
Mega!
Quick! Jump!
But she hesitates -
VELCRONIC BEAMS snag her from behind - pulling her back onto
the ledge.
Rush tumbles down the flume, glancing back to see:
Mega, hauled away by X-Takk Troops.
RUSH
MEGA!!!
(CONTINUED)

Fighters, Krod, Rush and Flynn surf down the data WHIRL,
accelerating away from the hot zone.
X-Takks jump in after them, but are all swallowed by the
flow - gone.

DATA FLUME
Rush and Krod plummet into surging hot data, out of control.
Flynn and Fighters expertly surf huge waves.
94
DATA BUFFER SHORE
Flynn, Boole and Quantz drag Rush and Krod from data shallows.
Everyone's circuits are hot and overloaded.
KROD
I'm cool.
Not a problem.
They let him go him go.
Krod glitches, collapses.
Rush gets to his feet, head spinning.
RUSH
They took Mega.

RUSH
How do we attack Plexor next?
Flynn sizes up his new convert.
QUANTZ
You're with us now?
BOOLE
Do you know hard it is?
Opposing
the power of Plexor?
RUSH
It's like the forty-sixth level of
ConquerDome 6.1, while winning a
side game of Tetras Ultra, doing six
Instant messages and debugging a
demo.
Boole, Quantz and Krod are confused, but Flynn gets it.
FLYNN
All at the same time.
RUSH
I'm there.
Krod too.
KROD
Say what?
Flynn accepts a handshake from Rush.
FLYNN
We're going to need all the help we
can get. Boole, can we make it to
the dark zone from here?
BOOLE
There is one possible route.
FLYNN
We'll meet up with the code monkeys
and combine forces.
95
TRANSITION INTO DARK ZONE
Group sets out across a vast region of unpowered circuitry.

X-NET BUILDER BOSS
On schedule.
Plexor boards his Cruiser, which SPEEDS onto a completed
stretch of X-Net OPTIK HIGHWAY. He's the only vehicle in
sight, hogging a thousand brand-new lanes of data expressway.
Plexor accelerates, relishing the thrill of unchecked power -
102
X-NET ARTERIES - VARIOUS
Plexor's Cruiser speeds through a new, as-yet unused X-Net
switching station. It's heavily secured. X-Takk troops
defer to their supreme leader.
Plexor veers onto a proprietary side-route, bound for:
103
X-NET CENTRAL SERVER
Firewall apertures cool, anticipating Plexor's arrival.
Encryption portal opens.
Plexor's Cruiser glides in.
Portal closes.
Firewalls reactivate, blazing red-hot, sealing the fortress.
104
DARK ZONE
Howling, barren, dim.
Circuitry left unpowered for eons.
Rush and Krod follow Flynn and Fighters, into treacherous
canyons, across vast planes.
Rush hears something and pulls the group behind cover.
RUSH
Over there!
Three massive X-NET X-PORTER VEHICLES rumble by. Imprisoned
in the rear are hundreds of Programs. Cruisers blast a path
through mountains and speed away.
KROD
Those Programs think they're just
being transferred!
RUSH
Can we take out those X-Net guys?
FLYNN
Our forces are too thin. We can't
risk a battle that would reveal this
position.
From another direction appear two Code Monkey Programs.
CODE MONK B3T
Flynn!
Down here!
FLYNN
BT!
JR!
CODE MONK J2R

FLYNN
Good to see you guys. When did the
X-Net goons start patrolling all the
way out here?
CODE MONK B3T
They're everywhere now. Taking all
Programs by force.
CODE MONK J2R
Come.
There is much to report!
They head down into:
108
CYBERSPACE - X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY OVER DARK ZONE
Compiler Crews work at megahertz speed. OPTIK HIGHWAYS extend
and converge. Switching stations assemble. Crews shift to
new assignments.
Pull wide to see dismal ground below.
Dark zone, emitting
woeful blips of random energy.
Pillars descend from X-Net crews above and SMASH into the
old silicon, planting themselves deep and impervious.
Rush stands on a vista point, aghast as X-Net construction
dominates the landscape.
FLYNN
It's a bummer being on the losing
team, huh Rush?
Flynn sits nearby, trying to patch his corrupted leg.
RUSH
We'll trash X-Net. Then we'll go
back to the our world and expose
what Sinclair's done.
He looks at Krod, Boole, Quantz and Code Monkeys in the
distance, preparing for battle.
RUSH
Do they have any idea our world
exists? Do they understand what a
User is?
FLYNN
Programs once connected freely with
their Users. But Plexor shut down
the I/O ports, severing all links.
He controls all contact with the
world we once knew. Programs operate
on his instructions or none at all.

RUSH
Or yours.
FLYNN
It's nothing to brag about.
We're
getting our butts kicked.
RUSH
It there a way to contact Meg? She
can transport us back to our world.
Maybe it's better if we fight Sinclair
on his own turf.
Flynn lays a somber gaze on his eager Fighters.
FLYNN
I gave up the idea of going back a
long time ago... You should too.
RUSH
What do you mean?
FLYNN
Sinclair didn't get where he is by
being dumb. Even if we survive
Plexor's forces in here, Sinclair
will make sure we never get back
home.
RUSH
But...
Meg said -
FLYNN
I'm sure she'll do everything she
can. It might not be enough.
Flynn removes a cover-plate from his leg, trying to hide the
damage from Rush. Suspicious, Rush pulls the plate aside.
RUSH
Oh, man.
Flynn's data corruption has worsened. His leg throbs with
the drab glow of irreversible MEMORY DRAIN.
RUSH
Why didn't you tell anyone it was
this bad?
Flynn looks at his leg.
Then at Rush.
FLYNN
Rush. I think Meg suspects the truth
about Sinclair.

FLYNN (CONT'D)
That's why she sent you here. She
knew you're the one guy who could
find out.
RUSH
I thought she hated me.
FLYNN
She believed in you more than you
believed in yourself.
It sinks in.
Wow.
RUSH
Do we really have a shot at winning
against Plexor?
FLYNN
We have his master key. And we have
Mega working on the inside.
RUSH
Mega... Are you sure about her? I
get the feeling she plays both sides.
FLYNN
Plexor programmed her to perform his
will. He's a control freak. I'm
not. I programmed her to have a
will of her own. Whatever she
decides, it's up to her.
RUSH
Sounds dangerous.
FLYNN
Sometimes you've got to trust the
bigger plan.
Krod and Fighters approach.
CODE MONK J2R
Ready to rock and roll.
FLYNN
Guys... Rush is right about our
final attack. If we've only got one
shot, we should go for Plexor's
central server. If we insert the
hologon key in the main power supply,
we can trigger a meltdown. Plexor
will be have his best troops standing
in our way.

FLYNN (CONT'D)
Getting past them was the ultimate
task I programmed Tron to carry out.
He takes up Tron's dark disk.
FLYNN
I turbo-charged him to burn hot and
burn fast. Who else could handle
the operating code in this disk?
He extends the disk to Rush.
FLYNN
You.
RUSH
Uhhh, I don't think so.
BOOLE
It could mean the difference between
winning and losing.
KROD
Hey, I'll try.
Rush holds off Krod, takes the disk.
RUSH
What do I do - ?
Waves of Rush's DATA ENERGY surge into disk circuitry.
RUSH
Yow!
He buckles and shakes.
Hands zapping.
Knees trembling.
FLYNN
Steady. It's all about giving as
much as you get. Let it become a
part of you.
Rush clenches teeth, concentrates.
Grips the disk.
Energy surges back and forth, up Rush's arms, around the
disk. He holds tight, ready to scream -
KROD
Awesome, dude! Don't let go!
Fighters are amazed, as TRON'S DISK POWERS UP -
And RUSH'S body circuits DAZZLE in the ruby circuitry patterns
of TRON.

KROD
HE DID IT!
FLYNN
Damn, look at that...
He did it.
Rush looks at his arms, astounded. His circuitry strobes in
hues of brilliant red. Disk animates and unfolds, revealing
infinite surface variations.
Rush feels new power surging inside his body. His eyes
harden, keen like Tron's. Rush LEAPS BACKWARD, goes airborne,
lands on a ledge high above. Amazing balance.
KROD & FIGHTERS
YES!
Excellent move, dude!
RUSH
It feels...
Awesome.
Rush's voice is a little deeper, with a digital edge.
It
surprises him.
He cocks his disk and THROWS.
Disk rockets across the landscape, a mile away and STRIKES
an X-NET SURVEY POST, blasting it to bits. Disk arcs high,
shoots back toward Rush.
Rush looks worried for a second, ready to duck -
FLYNN
Don't flinch, Rush!
It's your disk
now.
Disk snaps back into Rush's hand, painlessly.
Throbbing
with energy.
RUSH
Oh man, this is good.
Rush pulls a new LIGHT WAND from a thigh bracket. It extends
into a hundred-foot vaulting pole. Rush VAULTS across the
canyon, lands with precision. Light pole retracts into the
wand in a nanosecond.
KROD
Awwwww!
Where can I get one of those?
Another two vaults and a leap - Rush tosses his disk into a
spiral, steps off it mid-air (like stairs), and lands
perfectly - rejoining the group.
Cheers from Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys.
Flynn
shakes Rush's hand - energy surges between them.

X-NET CENTRAL SERVER
On the fortress perimeter, X-Takks stand watch at the base
of a deep security moat.
They turn, eyes scanning. Behind them, a LIGHT POLE extends
into the canyon, then swings across.
It's "tronified" Rush, using his vaulting pole to ferry
Fighters across the moat edges.
He returns to the far side, landing momentarily on a lone
central pinnacle to make the distance.
Rush vaults back to gather Krod, who's the last to cross.
RUSH
Don't take this the wrong way.
KROD
Don't drop me.
He hugs Krod and vaults them across.
Krod clings and
struggles, then YELPS -
X-Takks hear and scan the pinnacle and moat edges.
On top of the pinnacle, Rush and Krod hunker.
Flynn signals
from the far side "stay down!"
X-Takks patrol below, pausing to gaze up.
Atop the pinnacle, Krod's circuits energy-zap with fear.
Rush holds him down.
At last, X-Takks move on.
Rush extends his light pole to the moat floor - vaults to
the far side with Krod.
Krod stabilizes, looks around.
KROD
Yeah, I recognize this place.
I
know where everything is!

Boole and Code Monk B3t help Flynn to a secluded data buffer.
FLYNN
Rush, up there. See it?
Rush leaps to a high circuitry nexus.
RUSH
I hope you're right about Mega.
Rush touches circuitry, energizing it with data.
Mega's image appears in circuitry energy patterns.
MEGA
You.
Where is Flynn?
RUSH
We're all here.
MEGA
I arranged for your entry. An
encryption portal has been left
unlocked. Path 4786324BXY. Do you
know the way?
Rush looks down to Code Monk J2r.
He gives a high sign.

X-NET CENTRAL SERVER
Patrols of X-Takks pass.
Rush leaps to a vantage point them. Scouts a route, signals
Flynn, Krod, Boole, Quantz and the Code Monkeys.
Fighter team scales a narrow ledge near the BLAZING FIREWALL.
It's like a sheet of molten lead, pouring endlessly before
them. A lethal barrier.
FLYNN
This is all yours, Rush.
Rush pulls his disk, holds it over his head and steps under
the molten data flow. He struggles against raw power, disk
HEATS UP WHITE, splashing aside the molten data.
FLYNN
Go!
Quick!
Code Monkeys, Flynn and Krod, Quantz and Boole dive between
Rush's legs, emerging on the other side. Barrier overcome.
Rush leaps out of the firewall, clutching his white-hot disk.
RUSH
No sweat.

OUCH.
CODE MONK N1J

Keep moving.
They come to a dark encryption portal, seen from their
exterior view.
BOOLE
Portal 4786324BXY.
This is it.
Flynn withdraws the HOLOGON.
FLYNN
The sooner Rush gets this into the
main power supply, the sooner X-Net

Yeah man?
KROD
Are you really a "User"? Is there
such a thing? Is that what makes

All Programs hang on Rush's answer.
Flynn too.

Across the moat, a gut-wrenching sight:
All four Cybavors pounce on Flynn, hurling him off the ledge,
mauling him as they go down, dividing into eight - Plummeting
toward the MOLTEN DATA far below.
Plexor steps out of his corridor, relishing the view:
Remains

Code Monkeys attempt desperate measures, but soon it's over.
Bits of Rush dissipate into surrounding circuitry, then BEAM
