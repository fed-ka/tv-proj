      (Sheldon, Wolowitz)

      WOLOWITZ AND SHELDON ARE ON WOLOWITZ'S VESPA.  SHELDON IS 
      SCREAMING, HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE, MAKING IT NEARLY 
      IMPOSSIBLE FOR WOLOWITZ TO DRIVE. 

                                    SHELDON

                  (SCREAMS, THEN)  Oh god, not Catalina 

                Avenue!

      THE VESPA BUMPS VIOLENTLY.  SHELDON CLUTCHES WOLOWITZ TIGHTER 
      AND SCREAMS AGAIN AS WE:

      (DAY 2)
      (Leonard, Sheldon, Penny, Wolowitz, Koothrappali)

      SHELDON ENTERS FROM HIS BEDROOM DRESSED FOR WORK.  HE STOPS 
      WHEN HE SEES LEONARD, PENNY, WOLOWITZ AND KOOTHRAPPALI 
      SITTING AND WAITING FOR HIM.

                                    SHELDON

                (RE: PENNY)  She's in my spot.

      PENNY SLIDES OVER.  AS SHELDON SITS:

                easily trained.

      INSULTED, SHE LOOKS TO LEONARD.  LEONARD GESTURES FOR HER TO 
      STAY CALM AND BEGIN.  SHE TAKES A BREATH, THEN:

                (TO HIMSELF)  Hey, Raj.  What are you 

                doing today?  Oh, nothing special.  I 

                just thought I'd douse myself in 

                gasoline and set myself on fire and 

                see if anyone notices.  Well, that 

                sounds like fun.  Maybe you'd like a 

                sandwich first.  (CROSSING TO THE 

                KITCHEN)  Good idea.  I'd hate to burn 

                to death on an empty stomach.

      AND WE:
