Eli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been
cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the
floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.
Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword
idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.
As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe
box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off
hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.
He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head
grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.
The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick,
revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun
unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.
Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air.
Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise
largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.
KITCHEN
Every cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in
the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.
He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small
ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at
it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.
Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND.
Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick
enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on.
5.
BEDROOM
A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have
been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves
toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door.
No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN
HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth.
Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old
pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal
ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.
He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and
shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards
his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.
He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the
new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.
LATER
Eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat
over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he
watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking
it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat.
He clasps his hands together in prayer.
ELI
Dear Lord, thank you for your
generosity in providing us today
with this bountiful feast.
He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so,
we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like
John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon.
ELI
Thank you for the many gifts that
you have given me. Thank you for
your protection and your guidance.
Thank you for bringing me this far.
I know my long journey's end is
near. I ask now only for the
strength and the courage to
complete the task that you in your
infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow
upon me over all men. I won't let
you down. Amen.
He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off
a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great
relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.
6.
ELI
Hey. You hungry?
It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT
emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli
offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.
SUNDOWN
The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's
broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a
SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.
He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an
OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog-
eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.
Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the
beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.
He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading
sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.
MANY PAGES LATER
Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before.
Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.
A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to
a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli
reaches into his pocket and produces:
AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together
with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery
cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.
The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor.
Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.
THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air,
as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by
the music to another world, a world far from this one.
MORNING
Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the
exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.
The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly,
he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on.
Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.
He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside.
All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons.
7.
ELI
Come on now.
The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears
into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out.
Whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of POST-
APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display a variety of goods.
Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.
An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily, powering strings
of multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that hang all around.
16.
Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque
STILL is running. An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the
remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel.
Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In its
reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store.
Without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the
counter for something.
Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training
a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him.
ENGINEER
I don't know you.
Eli slowly raises his hands.
ELI
I'm not from around here.
ENGINEER
No shit. Who are you?
ELI
I'm just a customer.
ENGINEER
A customer with a shotgun?
He nods toward the shotgun visible on Eli's backpack.
ENGINEER
You come in here to rip me off?
The engineer's hands tremble, his finger tight on the
trigger. This man needs to be talked down carefully.
ELI
No. I'll set it down. Okay?
ENGINEER
Slowly!
Eli nods. Unhitches the pack and sets it down, steps away.
ENGINEER
You carry a gun in the outland, you
don't bring one into town less you
live there. Don't you know that?
ELI
I'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on
the road a long time.
17.
This seems to make the engineer more suspicious of Eli.
ENGINEER
Show me your hand.
ELI
I'm not a-
The engineer jerks the shotgun at Eli nervously.
ENGINEER
I said show me your fucking hand!
Eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced
downward. The engineer watches it closely for any sign of
ticks or tremors, but Eli's hand stays steady as a rock.
ELI
I'm not one of them.
The sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a
little. Finally, he lowers the shotgun.
ENGINEER
What do you want?
ELI
I'm just passing through. I need
some help. I can pay.
ENGINEER
What kinda help? And what kinda
pay?
ELI
I'm going to get something out of
my pack. Okay?
The engineer raises the shotgun nervously again.
ELI
I know, I know. Slowly.
The engineer watches him like a hawk as Eli opens up his pack
and pulls out the car battery. When he sees it, he gasps.
ENGINEER
Holy shit.
Eli places it on the counter. The engineer looks it over with
awe, like it's a priceless historical artifact.
ENGINEER
Where'd you find this?
18.
ELI
Years ago, in the outland back east
aways.
ENGINEER
Does it work?
ELI
Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can
you do it? I got the cables.
ENGINEER
Depends if you also got the coin.
Eli pulls the Zippo lighter from his pocket. The engineer
picks it up, sparks the flint, watches the flame flicker.
ENGINEER
It'll take a couple hours. There's
a bar across the street you can
wait, they just opened up.
ELI
I'll wait here.
ENGINEER
You don't trust me?
ELI
(SMILES)
I don't know you.
This once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats torn
out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the
stage. But still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place.
Looking out over the stage, a ROYAL BOX - once the most
prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an
OFFICE of sorts. Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE
MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it.
The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of
someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but
has no taste whatsoever.
A TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind
the desk, deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK.
The book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title
still just visible: 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE.
19.
The man is OLDER than most we've seen. His skin weathered by
the elements and by a long life's experience. One of the very
few people we've seen in this world close to Eli's age - and
unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well-
groomed. A rich mane of hair, full set of teeth.
He wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE. None of it matches,
everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. But he
looks almost civilized. Respectable. His name is CARNEGIE.
He looks up from his book at the sound of a POLITE COUGH O.S.
REDRIDGE stands before him. Tall, powerfully built.
CARNEGIE
What is it?
His accent is like caramel. A RICH, DEEP-SOUTH DRAWL.
REDRIDGE
Survey team just finished up their
inspection. It ain't good.
Carnegie lowers his book. Concerned.
CARNEGIE
How bad is it?
REDRIDGE
Pressure is down again, and going
by the new rod they sank levels're
lower than they've ever been.
Carnegie stands. Thinking. This is bad news.
CARNEGIE
How long?
REDRIDGE
Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A
little longer if we're careful. But
we're already-
CARNEGIE
Halve the rations.
REDRIDGE
We just halved `em last-
CARNEGIE
So halve them again!
BEAT. Carnegie stares Redridge down. Nobody but nobody
questions his orders.
20.
REDRIDGE
You're going to have to say
something. Folks were none too
happy last time. Gonna be worse
now, you can count on it.
Carnegie sighs, rubs his brow. He knows Redridge is right.
Carnegie emerges into the second-floor hallway from the
balcony, mopping his brow. Exhausted and stressed from his
grand theatrical display, and from its mixed reception.
Redridge climbs the stairs to meet him.
REDRIDGE
One of the road crews just rolled
into town.
Carnegie looks at his cracked old wristwatch.
CARNEGIE
Of course they did, the bar's open.
Outlanders, always looking for
answers at the bottom of a bottle.
REDRIDGE
Not these guys.
(BEAT)
These guys say they got something.
That gets Carnegie's attention.
CARNEGIE
Get them up here now.
23.
What was once a grand, gilded entrance foyer has, like the
rest of the theater, been largely gutted. But it's still
impressive - a spacious bar area with a grand staircase
leading up to a second floor, entrance to balcony seats, etc.
FADED OLD THEATER POSTERS still hang from the walls.
The place has been shabbily converted into a kind of SALOON.
Old ripped-out theater seats arranged around tables. A
FIREPLACE sputters dimly.
A MANGY TABBY CAT walks across the straw-laden floor. A dozen
or so CUSTOMERS in the place, a mixed, rough-looking bunch.
Redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of
his MEN who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs.
Carnegie checks his reflection in a CRACKED HAND MIRROR,
licks his palm and slicks his hair back. He adjusts his tie
as Redridge's men usher the bikers into his "office".
Carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them. Just as
when he gave his balcony address, Carnegie is in performance
mode - charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician.
CARNEGIE
Gentlemen! It's truly a delight to
see you again! I understand your
latest excursion into the outland
has been a profitable one?
The bikers exchange looks. They understood maybe half the
words in that sentence. The lead biker - named HOG - speaks.
HOG
We did good.
CARNEGIE
Well, let's see, shall we?
Hog tips the satchel's contents out onto Carnegie's desk.
BOOKS. About a dozen different volumes of all shapes and
sizes. Carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection.
We see various titles as he sorts through them. Treasure
Island. The Da Vinci Code. A volume of encyclopedia. The
Diary of Anne Frank. Tuesdays with Morrie.
In amongst the books are a few MAGAZINES. An old issue of
OPRAH magazine. A torn copy of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED...
24.
...And a NEWSWEEK. The cover graphic illustrates OPPOSING
NUCLEAR ARSENALS over a world globe. On one side the STARS
AND STRIPES, on the other flags indicating a SINO-ISLAMIC
ALLIANCE. The headline reads: "IS THERE NO TURNING BACK?"
CARNEGIE
No. No. No. No. No.
As Carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and
frustration, it's clear he's looking for a specific volume.
CARNEGIE
It's not here.
HOG
These ain't worth nothin'?
CARNEGIE
When you bring me the book I asked
you for, it'll be worth something.
The bikers exchange more looks. An unspoken conversation.
HOG
We been doin' this a long time now.
Had to make a whole lotta corpses
to bring you all these books. You
want us to keep at it, reckon it's
worth more than a few free glasses
of that swill you call liquor.
Carnegie's guards bristle, ready for a confrontation.
Carnegie just smiles, always ready to smooth things over.
CARNEGIE
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you
once again to take the long view
here. When we find this book - and
believe me, we will find it - we
are going to build a new world. A
world far greater, far more
righteous than this one. And you
and I are going to be perched right
on top of it, looking down upon it,
masters of all creation!
As always, his carefully stage-managed rhetoric is delivered
with the utmost conviction, every word dripping with passion
and persuasion. He's a master salesman, a true huckster.
CARNEGIE
And you know, I think you're
absolutely right.
(MORE)
25.
CARNEGIE (cont'd)
That is worth more than a few
glasses of liquor. A whole lot
more.
He steps forward and looks Hog right in the eye. His gaze
like a laser beam, utterly disarming.
CARNEGIE
The book I want is out there
somewhere, just waiting to be
found. Once there were millions of
copies - you only need to find one!
Find it and bring it here. And I
promise you, you will be rewarded
beyond anything you can imagine.
It's impossible not to be swayed by this guy. He's just so
full of fiery passion and infectious belief, you almost want
to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet.
Hog snatches up his empty satchel.
HOG
This better not be bullshit.
He turns and marches to the door, the other bikers following.
The guards escort them out, only Redridge remains.
Carnegie slumps back into his chair, frustrated, pissed off.
REDRIDGE
Might help if they knew just what
they were looking for.
CARNEGIE
Not one of them can read. How would
they even know when they found it?
REDRIDGE
So how's about you just tell me?
Carnegie and Redridge lock eyes. BEAT.
REDRIDGE
Two years now you been sending
these crews into the outland.
Burning up gas we can barely spare.
For a goddamn book? What the hell
kinda book can be worth all this?
Carnegie ignores him. Stands, walks toward the door. Redridge
sighs, gestures toward the books piled on Carnegie's desk.
26.
REDRIDGE
What about these?
CARNEGIE
Put them with the others.
Redridge stands by the marble fireplace, tossing the books
into the fire. The flames flicker and leap around the books
as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire.
Eli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas
generator, which chugs noisily.
He licks his lips, dry as sand. Unscrews his canteen to take
a drink, but it's down to its last few drips.
ELI
What's this place across the
street? They got any water?
ENGINEER
We got our own underground spring
here. Only fresh water in a hundred
miles - if's you can pay for it.
Eli thinks a while longer. Then stands and stuffs his shotgun
inside his pack, shoulders his gear and makes for the door.
ELI
I'll be back.
Eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer.
ELI
If that battery ain't here when I
get back, I will use this gun on
your kneecaps and I will put this
building to the torch and I will
watch it burn to the ground with
you alive inside it. So help me
God.
And with that he turns and leaves. The engineer gulps. Not a
hint in Eli's voice that he didn't mean every word.
This old second-floor DRESSING ROOM has been converted into a
bedroom, simply furnished.
27.
A WOMAN stands in front of an old DRESSING ROOM MIRROR, the
bulbs around the frame burned-out and broken. She washes her
face in murky water in an old PORCELAIN BOWL on the dresser.
Her name is CLAUDIA. Early 30s, pretty. She gazes into the
mirror as she dries her hands, but it's so cracked and warped
it's near impossible to see a reflection.
The door opens and Carnegie enters. He still looks steamed.
Claudia doesn't turn to look at him, keeps facing the mirror.
CLAUDIA
Is that you, honey?
Carnegie says nothing. Just paces angrily up and down.
Finally Claudia turns to face him.
CLAUDIA
Something wrong?
CARNEGIE
More books came in from the road
today.
CLAUDIA
Oh? It's been a while.
CARNEGIE
And it'll be a while longer. Just
another pile of useless junk. If we
don't find the right one soon - if
I can't give these people what they
want to hear...
Carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate.
Claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.
CLAUDIA
You'll find what you're looking
for. It's out there somewhere. You
just have to have faith.
This seems to anger Carnegie. He wheels on her.
CARNEGIE
Faith? Is that what you think we're
missing around here?
She detects the aggressive tone in his voice and goes quiet,
head bowed. Carnegie moves toward her angrily.
CARNEGIE
My old man used to have faith. He
had it in spades. My mother, too.
(MORE)
28.
CARNEGIE (cont'd)
You know where it got them? You
know where it got me?
He's in her face now. Claudia avoids eye contact, submissive.
CARNEGIE
Faith is for the weak. It's for
them out there, the sheep. This
world is what you can see and touch
and taste. It's what you make it.
All these years with me, you still
don't have any grasp of that?
What's wrong with you, woman?
He's shouting now, and she's trembling, afraid to speak.
CLAUDIA
I'm sorry.
Carnegie realizes he's frightened her. He softens.
CARNEGIE
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
scare you. Hey. You okay?
He lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.
CARNEGIE
You just get me all riled up with
that kind of talk. It's not what I
need from you right now.
(SMILES)
You know what I need right now?
He puts his hands on her lustfully. It's clear she's not in
the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. More out of
a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion.
As they kiss, Carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall
and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.
The original customers have now been joined by the four
bikers, who sit at their own table drinking a clear and
pungent moonshine-type liquor from a shared jar.
Eli enters. All eyes are on him immediately, regarding him
with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar.
The BARTENDER approaches, looks him up and down. Suspicious.
BARTENDER
Outlander? Let me see-
29.
Eli raises his hand as before. Holds it outstretched, steady.
BARTENDER
What'll it be?
Eli places the canteen on the bar.
ELI
Water.
BARTENDER
That's the good stuff. Gotta eat
into my own ration to sell it - so
I don't sell it cheap.
Eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar. The bartender
takes it and looks it over. Not particularly impressed.
BARTENDER
That'll get you maybe half-way.
The bartender spies Eli's silver Saint Christopher pendant.
BARTENDER
What about that?
Eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. No way that's for
sale. Instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur
pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.
ELI
That's the best I got.
The bartender takes a pelt and examines it. The mangy cat
leaps up onto the bar and approaches. Sniffs at the pelts
with suspicion and HISSES at Eli.
Eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. At the
biker's table Hog watches this, not happy about this.
Satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along
with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.
BARTENDER
Solara!
A TEENAGE GIRL emerges from the back. No older than 16 or 17.
Dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair
tied back in a ponytail. But even through all this, it's
clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman.
The bartender takes Eli's canteen and hands it to Solara
along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck.
30.
BARTENDER
Take this out back and get it
filled.
Solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look Eli up
and down. Unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued.
There's something about him she can't put her finger on...
He doesn't look back at her. She turns and exits.
As Eli sits at the bar, a SHADOW comes into view and looms
large over him. Hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting
a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers.
Solara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking Eli's
canteen away into the back room.
HOG
That was my cat.
Eli doesn't turn. Just looks straight ahead. Impossible to
read him behind those mirrored goggles. Utterly inscrutable.
ELI
Fine specimen.
HOG
I saw you push him off the bar.
ELI
I didn't push him.
HOG
You raised your hand at him.
31.
ELI
Sorry. It won't happen again.
The bartender looks at Hog nervously.
BARTENDER
Hey, how about another drink, Hog?
HOG
That cat's been comin' in here for
nigh on two years. It got more
right to be here than you. Who the
fuck do you think you are?
ELI
I don't want any trouble.
Hog grabs him by the arm.
HOG
Well, that's too bad, `cause-
Blink. Suddenly Hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing
more than Eli's thumb. Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in
his neck. Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed.
ELI
I know you. Murderer of innocent
travelers on the road. You're going
to spend eternity drowning in a
lake of fire for the things that
you've done. Did you know that?
The other bikers stand and approach, the OTHER CUSTOMERS
following suit. Eli senses the trouble gathering behind him.
ELI
You go on back to your table and
I'll be on my way. All right?
It's all Hog can do to just barely nod his head. Eli releases
his thumb. Hog staggers backward, gasping for breath.
Eli stands and makes toward the door, but the bikers and
other patrons have moved to block his exit.
BURLY PATRON
You push Hog, you push all of us.
Eli sighs, looks down at the floor. He's been pushed one time
too many today. For the first time, we see anger in his face.
32.
ELI
Cursed be the ground because of
you. By toil shall you eat of it.
Thorns and thistles shall it sprout
for you. From the ground were you
taken. For dust you are.
The patrons look at Eli strangely. Who is this guy?
Eli reaches back and draws the samurai sword. Carves a line
in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade.
ELI
And to dust you shall return.
Carnegie has Claudia pinned against the wall, his pants
bunched around his ankles, ass bared as he pounds away at
her. Not making love. This is mechanical, loveless sex.
Claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as
Carnegie thrusts into her again and again. Deeply
uninterested, just waiting for it to be over.
Suddenly, we hear a CRASH O.S. Carnegie stops and listens.
CARNEGIE
Did you hear that? What was that?
Claudia sees an opening to get out of this.
CLAUDIA
Maybe you should go check.
BEAT. Carnegie keeps listening. Then comes another CRASH.
CARNEGIE
What in the hell is going on?
He pulls up his pants, grabbing a RIFLE propped by the door
as he rushes out. Claudia just stands there for a moment,
then reaches down and pulls up her panties.
She moves from the wall and makes her way across the room,
feeling her way with her hands, gazing off into nothingness.
Only now do we finally realize that she is BLIND.
Carnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony. Looks
down over the railing - and is stunned by what he sees.
33.
CHAOS in the bar below. Eli cutting a one-man swath of mayhem
through the dozen brawlers. Most already lie dead. TWO MORE
MEN ATTACK Eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword.
Carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing, banging loudly
on the doors of the upstairs rooms.
CARNEGIE
Get your asses out here!
ON ELI. Surrounded by the dead, only one man left standing.
Hog. He backs away as Eli circles him like a predator. Sword
held ready, the blade glistening with dark red blood.
SOLARA re-emerges from the back room with Eli's refilled
canteen. She stops and emits a horrified GASP when she sees
the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her.
She watches, mortified, as Eli moves toward the helpless,
terrified Hog, going in for the kill. Raising his sword...
Suddenly, Solara steps forward and CRIES OUT:
SOLARA
Stop!
Eli FREEZES. Sword hanging in the air, poised to strike. He
turns his head to where Solara stands behind the bar.
SOLARA
Please don't.
BEAT as Eli considers. He looks back at Hog, still completely
at his mercy... and then LOWERS THE SWORD.
ELI
Go.
HOG
(CONFUSED)
...What?
ELI
It ain't for me to judge you. Your
time for that's gonna come. Believe
me. Now go on. Get out of here.
Hog stumbles backward through the door, into the sunlight.
Eli moves toward Solara, who stands petrified behind the bar.
Reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose grip.
ELI
Thank you.
34.
In the exitway, Hog turns back inside, grabbing up a BROKEN
BOTTLE from the bloody floor as he goes.
Hog rushes Eli from behind. Solara sees him coming and goes
to SCREAM - but before any sound can come, Eli flips his
sword backward and Hog runs right onto it, SKEWERING HIMSELF.
BEAT. Hog just stands there for a moment, eyes wide, frozen
in shock. His fingers go limp, dropping the bottle.
He slides off the sword and collapses to the floor, dead.
Eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it. Looks around at
the bloodied, fallen bodies. Then back at Solara.
ELI
I'm sorry for all the mess.
As he turns and heads toward the door:
CARNEGIE (O.S.)
Hold it right there.
Accompanied by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS COCKING.
Carnegie is on the landing, training his rifle down at Eli.
Alongside him, FIVE GUNMEN do the same. They've got him cold.
Carnegie sits at his desk, the huge auditorium and stage area
visible behind him. Eli stands before him. Around him are the
other gunmen, who keep their weapons trained on him.
Standing at Carnegie's side are REDRIDGE and CLAUDIA.
CARNEGIE
So, who are you?
ELI
Nobody. A walker in the outland.
CARNEGIE
I've met walkers before. Not a
particularly civilized bunch. Some
have even taken to eating their own
kind, did you know that? You
wouldn't be one of those savages
now, would you?
Carnegie's gunmen look him over, inspecting him warily.
CARNEGIE GUNMAN
He ain't got the shakes.
35.
Carnegie's confident gaze remains fixed on Eli throughout.
CARNEGIE
Good. This is a civilized town.
Under God. Do you know what that
means?
Eli can't help but react at the mention of that word.
CARNEGIE
It means we have laws here. Laws
set down long before any of us ever
walked this earth. And one of them
is, you don't eat the flesh of your
brother. Else you're no better than
an animal. And not welcome here.
Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there in Carnegie's gaze.
CARNEGIE
So what's your business here,
friend? Walkers don't usually come
into town less they want something.
ELI
I had a battery needed charging and
a canteen needed filling. I didn't
come here looking for trouble.
Barely noticeable, Carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen,
who nods in acknowledgement and leaves.
CARNEGIE
Well, you sure as hell found it. Do
you know who I am?
ELI
No.
CARNEGIE
My name's Carnegie. I own this bar.
I own the whole town. You've never
heard of me?
ELI
That's you out there on the street.
CARNEGIE
Remarkable likeness, isn't it?
You'd never guess half the men who
built it were blind. A small
tribute from a grateful people. I
was deeply touched.
36.
ELI
You had slaves build you a monument
to yourself?
The mention of that word rankles Carnegie. He walks around
the desk toward Eli, waves an admonishing finger at him.
CARNEGIE
Don't call them slaves. That's an
old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm
trying to help these people.
Carnegie can't help himself - once again he is in his natural
element, spinning the argument his way, pitching. Selling.
CARNEGIE
In the outland the sightless are
preyed upon like sick animals. Here
at least they're protected. They do
the essential work others don't
want. And in return they eat, they
drink, they survive. Last year, a
couple of them even got married -
performed the ceremony myself.
(BEAT)
You see, I'm not exploiting these
people - I'm saving them! Any one
of them is free to leave whenever
they wish. But here they stay. And
they thank me every single day for
their salvation!
An impressive, impassioned performance. He sounds just like
an old-school TV evangelist. But Eli is unmoved.
ELI
It's none of my business what you
do here. Like you said, it's your
town. I just want to be on my way.
CARNEGIE
What's your name, walker?
Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there.
CARNEGIE
All right, I guess we just call you
Walker. Don't see too many folks
your age these days. You lived in
the world before? You can read?
ELI
I read every day.
37.
CARNEGIE
That's good. Good man. We educated
folk, we need to stick together, if
we're ever going to rebuild this
world. People like you and me,
we're the future.
ELI
What do you want with me?
CARNEGIE
Straight to the point. I like that.
Fact is, you could be in a lot of
trouble. This is a peaceful town.
You walk in here, armed, and the
next thing a dozen of my good
citizens are dead. I've hanged men
for less. I could hang you.
(BEAT)
Or, you could come work for me.
ELI
What?
CARNEGIE
I never once saw anyone handle
themselves the way you did down
there in that bar. I don't know
where you learned it, but I sure as
hell could use it.
ELI
I'm not interested.
CARNEGIE
People who work for me can live
better than any walker ever
dreamed. Real beds, clean water,
hot food. Women, even. You could do
a lot worse, my friend.
ELI
I'm not your friend. And I'm not
staying. I got someplace I need to
be. Out west.
CARNEGIE
West? There is nothing west. It's
all gone, a long time ago.
ELI
I've been told different.
38.
CARNEGIE
By who?
Eli doesn't reply. Carnegie smiles, dials up the charm.
CARNEGIE
All right, look. I'm going to make
you an offer of goodwill. Stay the
night, think it over. Try a little
local hospitality. We'll talk again
in the morning. If you're still not
interested, you're free to go. No
hard feelings.
ELI
Thank you for your offer. But I'd
prefer to just leave right now. So
you can either let me out of here,
or I can kill my way out.
The gunmen bristle, exchange nervous looks. Carnegie appears
unfazed. He smiles. BEAT. He looks to the gunman at the door.
CARNEGIE
Let him go.
The gunman opens the door. Eli turns and exits.
The engineer stands behind the counter, looking worried. His
heart sinks when he sees Eli enter.
ENGINEER
Oh, shit...
ELI
How's my battery?
ENGINEER
It's, uh... it's gonna take a
little longer than I thought.
ELI
How much longer?
ENGINEER
It's gotta charge overnight. You,
uh, you can always stay here in
town, pick it up in the morning.
Eli leans in a little closer. He smells a rat.
39.
ELI
You remember what I said would
happen if I came back here and you
didn't have my battery?
ENGINEER
It's right here! It's just gonna
take a while longer. I swear.
Eli looks at the engineer. Hard to be certain, but he's
pretty sure he's lying. Somebody got to him.
A VIOLENT COMMOTION is heard from down the hall. Suddenly one
of Carnegie's henchmen comes flying into view as he is THROWN
HARD INTO A WALL and slumps to the floor, unconscious.
Eli storms into the box, pissed. MORE GUARDS rush in behind
him. Carnegie, seated behind his desk, waves the guards off
as he stands to greet Eli, smiling ingratiatingly as ever.
CARNEGIE
I knew you'd reconsider.
ELI
Yeah? How'd you know that?
CARNEGIE
None of the walkers I've seen come
here from the outland were ever
what you'd call smart. I mean all
those years out there alone on the
road, some with their brains half-
fried from eating each other - it's
understandable why you people
aren't the brightest bulbs in the
box. But I never met one so dumb
that he'd turn down a meal and a
bed if it was offered.
ELI
So you didn't send someone across
the street to the engineer?
CARNEGIE
Engineer? I don't know what you're
talking about. If there's something
wrong, maybe I can help.
Carnegie is a practiced liar. Much more difficult to read.
40.
CARNEGIE
This is Redridge. He's kind of my
right-hand man around here.
Redridge - one of the two men who chased Eli into the room -
steps forward. He regards Eli with a distrustful eye.
CARNEGIE
He'll show you to your room.
Redridge opens the door and ushers Eli inside.
It's another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom,
less well-appointed than Carnegie's own. A threadbare rug.
Bed with relatively clean sheets. A sink for washing.
REDRIDGE
Enjoy your stay. There'll be
someone outside your room all
night. If you need anything.
Redridge smirks and closes the door, leaving Eli alone. Eli
paces across the room. Finally sits down on the creaky old
bed. Trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here.
He unshoulders his pack, sets it down. Lies down on the bed.
It's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back.
A KNOCK at the door. Eli gets quickly to his feet.
ELI
Hello?
The door opens and CLAUDIA enters. Carrying a metal tub of
water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray.
CLAUDIA
I have this for you. Water for
washing and some food.
Eli just stands there. Totally unfamiliar with this kind of
situation, it's been too long. She smiles, embarrassed.
CLAUDIA
Well... are you going to take it?
ELI
Oh. Thank you.
He takes the stuff from her, sets it on the table.
41.
CLAUDIA
You're very welcome.
We get the impression that Claudia is as unfamiliar with this
kind of polite interaction as Eli. But she likes it.
CLAUDIA
It'll be dark soon.
She strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table. The
room is lit by its flickering glow.
CLAUDIA
Can I get you anything else?
ELI
No, thank you.
CLAUDIA
Well. Have a good night.
As she turns for the door:
ELI
You're Carnegie's woman?
CLAUDIA
Why do you ask?
ELI
Just making conversation is all.
Haven't had one of those in a
while. Not a real one, leastways.
Claudia smiles. Neither has she.
CLAUDIA
He found me in the outland. I was
sixteen, my family had been...
well, they were gone. There was
just me and my baby.
ELI
You had a baby?
CLAUDIA
I'd met some men on the road. Bad
men. They...
BEAT. She trails off, struggling with this unhappy memory.
Eli gets it, raises a hand reassuringly.
ELI
It's all right.
42.
CLAUDIA
I was on the road for a year after
that. I couldn't feed myself, let
alone my little girl. And then Bill
found us and he promised he'd take
care of us. He told me he was going
to make a place where we could be
safe. And he did. He did all that.
He built this whole town. He kept
us safe. And he raised that child
like she was his own. He's been so
good to both of us. He saved us,
really.
There's a bittersweet quality to Claudia's words. As though
there is more to the story than she is telling.
Eli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her.
ELI
You want to eat some?
She smiles and sits. Eli sits across from her.
ELI
When did you go blind? In the war?
You get caught in a flash?
CLAUDIA
No, I was born this way. I think
I'm lucky like that.
ELI
Lucky?
CLAUDIA
It's not like I ever knew what I'm
missing. I was already used to
being like this by the time... by
the time it all happened. So I got
around pretty good even when I was
on my own. And now it's easy. I
know every creaky old floorboard in
here, and it's not like I ever go
any place else. Bill would never
allow it. He worries about me so
much.
Again, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped.
Thinking about it begins to upset her. She gets up.
CLAUDIA
I should go. He'll be wondering
where I am.
43.
Eli stands, escorts her to the door and opens it.
CLAUDIA
Thank you. I enjoyed our
conversation.
ELI
So did I.
Eli closes the door, then sits back at the table.
Carnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing-room
mirror. He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim reflection.
CARNEGIE
You took your time in there. How
long does it take to deliver a
plate of food and some water?
A subtly accusing tone. It makes Claudia nervous.
CLAUDIA
He wanted to talk.
CARNEGIE
Oh? What about?
CLAUDIA
Nothing really. He asked me what it
was like to be blind.
CARNEGIE
He tell you anything about him?
CLAUDIA
No. I don't think he likes to talk
about himself much.
CARNEGIE
Yeah, I got that.
Claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.
CLAUDIA
I don't think he's going to change
his mind by morning. I don't think
he's going to stay.
CARNEGIE
What makes you say that?
44.
CLAUDIA
Just strikes me as the kind of man
who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't
seem like the type to go changing
it once it's set.
CARNEGIE
Well, we'll just see about that.
CLAUDIA
You saw him. He's not like the
others. You won't be able to smooth-
talk him and wrap him around your
finger like you usually do.
CARNEGIE
Who said anything about me?
(BEAT)
I'm sending Solara.
Claudia reacts suddenly to this. Shocked and angry.
CLAUDIA
You're doing what?
CARNEGIE
You know how often these walkers
get laid? Never. Least not by
anything living or willing. Girl
like her can be very persuasive.
CLAUDIA
You can't send her in there with
him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!
CARNEGIE
You went in there readily enough.
CLAUDIA
That's different. Solara's just a
child, she can't-
Carnegie sighs, tiring of this.
CARNEGIE
She's a grown woman now, Claudia.
Sooner or later you're going to
have to accept that. She has to
earn her keep around here, same as
the rest of us.
CLAUDIA
By working as a whore? That's all
you think she's fit for?
45.
CARNEGIE
We've each been given a talent to
help us make our way in this world.
Some people's gift is more evident
than others. Solara's sure as hell
is.
Claudia looks at Carnegie in disgust.
CLAUDIA
What kind of a man are you?
Now it's Carnegie's turn to get angry. He rounds on her
menacingly. She backs off as he approaches.
CARNEGIE
I'm the kind of man who'd pull a
helpless blind girl off the road, a
girl who'd been beaten and raped,
and give her a place where she can
live without fear! Without me you'd
be just another no-eye, lying dead
in the outland, picked clean by the
buzzards, or shoveling dirt down
there with the others. That's the
kind of man I am!
He has her against the wall, his face just inches from hers.
CLAUDIA
I don't live without fear. I
haven't for a long time now.
Carnegie calms himself, backs off. Claudia goes to leave.
CARNEGIE
Where are you going?
CLAUDIA
I'm not going to let you do this.
Carnegie surges forward and pins Claudia to the wall.
CARNEGIE
You're not going to let me?
(BEAT)
Nobody tells me what I can and
can't do in my own town. Nobody. I
built this world, and I am God
here! So don't go thinking about
screwing with my plans. You know
how this works. Solara goes against
me, you get hurt. You go against
me, she gets hurt.
46.
He releases his grip on her.
CARNEGIE
So let's not see anybody get hurt.
Okay?
He speaks more softly now. As he strokes his hand tenderly
through Claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.
Dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the
oil lamp. Eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old
leather-bound book from his backpack.
Another KNOCK at the door. Eli jumps up and hurriedly hides
the book inside his shirt.
ELI
Come in.
The door opens to reveal Solara. Looking very different than
she did before. Cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer
dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. Stunning.
Unlike everyone else we have met, she seems - physically, at
least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. Far
too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.
SOLARA
Hi. Can I come in?
ELI
Someone was already here with food
and water. I got everything I need.
SOLARA
You sure about that?
She glides into the room, closing the door. She's good. Very
seductive. Eli is totally disarmed in her presence.
SOLARA
It's too bright in here. Mind if I
turn it down a little?
She doesn't wait for an answer. Moves to the table and turns
down the oil lamp. A darker, more seductive lighting scheme.
SOLARA
That's better. I'm Solara. You're
Walker, right?
47.
ELI
No. My name's Eli.
SOLARA
That short for something? Elias?
ELI
Elijah.
SOLARA
Elijah. I never heard that one
before. It's kinda cute.
She sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. Her light
cotton dress revealing in all the right places. The
silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the
oil lamp. No red-blooded man on earth could resist her.
ELI
Look, I don't mean to be rude. But
I'm really not interested.
SOLARA
You sure about that? It gets mighty
lonely out there on the road.
She leans over on the bed, resting on her elbow. Her hair
cascades down. God damn, she looks good.
SOLARA
If you're worried about money, this
is all paid for. The whole night.
ELI
It's not that. You're a very nice
girl. But I'm not that kind of man.
She slides off the bed, approaches him. Begins to work the
buttons of his shirt.
SOLARA
They're all that kind of man.
He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step.
ELI
I'm not.
She is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And
then she seems a little insulted.
SOLARA
They told me you were crazy. Maybe
they were right.
48.
Eli opens the door for her.
ELI
I'm sorry. Good night.
Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves
to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye.
SOLARA
Please don't make me leave. I have
to stay the night. If I don't...
ELI
If you don't, what?
SOLARA
He'll hurt my mom.
ELI
Who will? Carnegie?
She nods, fighting back a tear. This angers Eli.
ELI
Maybe he and I oughta have words.
He goes for the door handle, but she stops him.
SOLARA
No! Please, don't!
ELI
He's hurting you. He's hurting your
mother. He's-
SOLARA
He's my dad.
BEAT. Eli moves his hand away from the door.
SOLARA
Look, if you want to help me, just
let me stay here tonight. We don't
have to do anything. I'll sleep on
the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my
dad that we had a good time. I'll
be no trouble, I swear.
She looks up at Eli imploringly. Transformed. No longer the
teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little girl.
ELI
You want to have a conversation?
49.
She smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek.
LATER
Eli and Solara sit together on the bed. A silent BEAT. At
first, it appears as though they have nothing to say.
ELI
You know, you don't have to be
afraid of me. What happened down
there in the bar...
SOLARA
I'm not afraid of you. I know you
didn't start that trouble. When I
first saw you, I knew you weren't
the type to go looking for it.
ELI
How'd you know that?
SOLARA
My mom says I'm a good judge of
character. She says I can read
people. That I know a good man when
I see one.
She smiles. Eli is surprised to find himself smiling back.
SOLARA
So... you're pretty old, right?
Eli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question.
SOLARA
I'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't
seen too many people your age. How
old are you exactly?
ELI
You know, I don't rightly remember.
SOLARA
But you're old enough. I mean, you
remember what it was like? In the
world before?
Eli nods.
SOLARA
What was it like?
Eli thinks about this. Dredging through old, old memories.
50.
ELI
Better than this.
(BEAT)
People lived longer back then.
Longer than me. Some were more than
a hundred years old.
Solara smiles like she's having her leg pulled.
SOLARA
Come on.
ELI
I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's
not the same. If you're sick or
you're weak or you're old you won't
last long out on the road.
SOLARA
So how come you have?
BEAT. Eli thinks. Should he or shouldn't he?
ELI
Can I read you something?
SOLARA
Wait. You can read?
Eli pulls the book from his shirt. Solara's eyes widen.
SOLARA
And you have a book?
ELI
Not just any book.
For the first time we see that it's a KING JAMES BIBLE. An
embossed GOLD CROSS on its old leather cover.
Eli opens it up, scans the page with his finger until he
finds the passage he's looking for.
ELI
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall
not want. He makes me lie down in
green pastures. He leads me beside
still waters. He restores my soul.
He leads me in the paths of
righteousness.
ON SOLARA as she listens to Eli read. Transfixed.
51.
ELI
Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear no
evil. For you are with me. Your rod
and your staff, they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me in
the presence of my enemies. You
anoint my head with oil. My cup
runs over. Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow me, all the days
of my life. And I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.
SOLARA
That's beautiful. Did you write
that?
ELI
(SMILES)
No.
SOLARA
What book is it from? Is it poetry?
ELI
I guess you could think of it that
way. It's from the Holy Bible.
SOLARA
I never heard of it. What's it
about?
BEAT as Eli thinks. How on earth to answer that?
ELI
It's about love, and forgiveness,
and life and death, and mercy, and
revenge, and the beginning and the
end of the world. I guess it's
about a little bit of everything.
SOLARA
Can I see?
She reaches out for the book but he snatches it away.
SOLARA
What? I'm not going to do anything.
ELI
I'm sorry. I'm charged to protect
this book. I can't trust it with
anyone. Not even for a while.
52.
SOLARA
What's so special about that book?
BEAT. Eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross on
the beat-up leather cover.
ELI
It's the last one. There are no
other books like this. All the
others are gone - destroyed by the
war or in the burnings that came
after. This is the only one that
survived until now. The last one
anywhere.
SOLARA
How can you know that?
ELI
I just know.
(BEAT)
For a long while after it happened,
I just wandered on the road like
most everybody else. There were
still a lot of people around back
then, in the beginning. I didn't
really know what I should do or
where I was going. I was just
moving from place to place, trying
to stay alive. And then one day I
heard this voice. I don't know how
to explain it, it's like it was
coming from inside me. But I could
hear it, clear as day. Clear as I
can hear you talking to me now.
SOLARA
What did it say?
ELI
It led me to this place, I don't
really know where. And I found this
book buried deep under some rubble.
No way no-one was ever going to
find it if they didn't know exactly
where to look.
SOLARA
But you knew because the voice told
you?
ELI
That's right. And that voice told
me to carry the book west.
(MORE)
53.
ELI (cont'd)
It told me that a path would be
laid out before me, that I'd be led
to a place where this book would be
safe. It told me I'd be protected
against anyone or anything that
tried to stand in my way. If only I
would have faith.
(BEAT)
That was twenty-five years ago. And
I've been walking ever since.
SOLARA
(SKEPTICAL)
Because a voice you heard in your
head told you to.
ELI
I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it.
I know what I heard.
SOLARA
So who was it? The voice?
BEAT as Eli considers his answer.
ELI
A very important, very powerful
man.
SOLARA
More powerful than my dad?
ELI
(SMILES)
I should say so, yes.
BEAT. The two of them sit in silence for a moment.
SOLARA
Would you teach me to read?
ELI
What?
SOLARA
I never learned. No-one around here
knows how. Only my dad, and he
won't teach me. I think he likes
being the only one who can read. I
think it makes him feel powerful.
ELI
I think you're probably right.
54.
SOLARA
So would you teach me?
ELI
I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow.
And I won't be back this way, ever.
She looks down, sad. She likes this guy. She doesn't want him
to leave. Eli can sense her sadness.
ELI
Are you hungry?
SOLARA
I guess a little.
ELI
There's some food on the table over
there. Let's eat.
She walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a small
cloth. She whips it away - to reveal ELI'S RAT nibbling on a
piece of cheese. Solara SHRIEKS and backs away.
The rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Eli's
shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it.
ELI
It's okay, it's okay. He's with me.
(to the rat)
Don't be afraid, pal. This is
Solara. She's our friend.
Solara approaches warily. Reaches out and strokes him. The
rat scurries up her arm. She almost shrieks again.
ELI
It's okay. It means he likes you.
SOLARA
It does?
ELI
Trust me, if he didn't like you,
you'd know about it.
Solara pets the rat on her shoulder. Then:
SOLARA
Did you really mean that?
ELI
Mean what?
55.
SOLARA
That I'm your friend.
BEAT. Eli finds himself surprised that he admitted such a
thing. When is the last time he had someone he could call a
friend? He can't even remember.
ELI
Sure.
She smiles. Giggles as the rat's whiskers tickle her ear.
Eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to Solara. She's
about to eat but stops as Eli clasp his hands in prayer.
ELI
Our father, we thank you for this
meal which you have been so
gracious to place before us.
Unsure of what to do, Solara mimics Eli, putting her hands
together and bowing her head.
ELI
We thank you for a warm bed and a
roof over our heads on a cold night
such as this.
(BEAT)
And we thank you for the gift of
friendship in these hard times.
Solara looks at him, touched by that.
ELI
Amen.
(BEAT)
You say that last part too.
SOLARA
Amen. And now we eat?
ELI
And now we eat.
They sit and eat together, sharing the simple meal.
PULL OUT from the window as they eat, away from the theater.
Away from the town and its flickering points of torchlight.
Moving farther and farther away until the entire town is
consumed by the darkness of the world.
What was once the theater's COSTUME ROOM - OLD MANNEQUINS
still stand around in the corners, creating an eerie feel.
Carnegie and Claudia sit at a DINING TABLE, eating breakfast
in silence. A third place is set, but no-one is seated there.
Solara enters and sits down without a word.
CARNEGIE
Good morning, Solara.
Solara doesn't say anything.
CARNEGIE
I said good morning, Solara.
SOLARA
Morning, dad.
CARNEGIE
How was your night? Did you sleep
well?
Claudia appears perturbed by Carnegie's subtle probing.
Solara flashes him a frosty look.
SOLARA
I did like you asked. Isn't that
what you really want to know? Just
come out and say it.
Carnegie glares at her sternly.
CARNEGIE
You don't speak to your father like
that. When I ask you a civil
question, I expect a civil answer.
Solara lowers her head, scorned. Carnegie continues eating.
CARNEGIE
Did he say anything?
SOLARA
No. We didn't talk much.
CARNEGIE
Well, do you think you managed to
change his mind about staying?
SOLARA
I don't know. He said he had to go.
57.
Carnegie puts down his food, looks angrily at her.
CARNEGIE
So he did talk? What else did he
say? Come on, I want all of it!
SOLARA
That's all he said. That he was
going to be leaving this morning.
CARNEGIE
We'll see. This is my town, nobody
leaves until I say they leave.
He glances knowingly at Claudia.
CLAUDIA
Solara, honey, eat something.
She looks at the food on the plate before her. Then closes
her eyes and clasps her hands in prayer.
SOLARA
Our father, thank you for this meal
which you have been so gracious to
place before us.
Claudia and Carnegie freeze. Carnegie stares at her, agape.
SOLARA
Thank you for my mother. Please
watch over her and keep her safe.
CARNEGIE
Solara...
SOLARA
Thank you for all the-
CARNEGIE
Solara!
She snaps suddenly out of it, looks at her father.
CARNEGIE
What the hell are you doing?
She doesn't respond. Looks embarrassed.
CARNEGIE
God didn't put this food on the
table. Do you hear me?
(BEAT)
Who put this food on the table?
58.
Solara says nothing, just looks down at the table.
CARNEGIE
I said who put this food on the
table?
SOLARA
(SOFTLY)
You did.
CARNEGIE
Who taught you that?
SOLARA
Eli taught me.
CARNEGIE
(PUZZLED)
Who the hell is Eli?
SOLARA
The walker. That's his name.
CARNEGIE
And he taught you how to say those
words? How did he know them?
SOLARA
He had them written down in a book.
This piques Carnegie's interest greatly.
CARNEGIE
What kind of a book?
He barks the question at her. Solara is rattled.
SOLARA
I don't remember! It was an old
leather book. It had kind of a...
thing on the front of it.
CARNEGIE
Show me.
Solara makes the SIGN OF A CRUCIFIX with her index fingers.
Carnegie's eyes widen; he can barely believe it.
CARNEGIE
He had a bible?
SOLARA
That's what it was. A holy bible.
Daddy, what's wrong? Did I...
59.
Carnegie BOLTS SUDDENLY FROM THE TABLE, overturning his chair
and sending his plate of food crashing to the floor.
Carnegie races across the landing, toward the ARMED GUARD
posted outside Eli's bedroom. The guard steps aside as
Carnegie flings the door open and barges inside.
Empty. No sign of Eli or his gear anywhere. The window is
WIDE OPEN, the curtains fluttering gently in the breeze.
His hands shaking, the engineer disconnects Eli's battery
from the generator and places it on the counter.
Eli stands on the other side of the counter with his SHOTGUN
TRAINED RIGHT AT THE MAN'S HEAD. He takes the battery from
him and stuffs it into his backpack.
Solara and Claudia watch through the window. Turn suddenly
when they hear the door slam open behind them.
Carnegie stands in the doorway, glaring at them.
Eli kicks the door wide open, finds Carnegie holding Solara
against the wall. She sobs, terrified. Eli levels the shotgun
at Carnegie's head.
ELI
Let her go.
62.
CARNEGIE
That cannon of yours casts a pretty
wide net. I don't reckon you can
hit me without hitting her.
ELI
I reckon you're right.
He holsters the shotgun. Then in the same fluid motion draws
a PISTOL from his belt that we never even knew he had.
ELI
This, though? With this I'll shave
the hairs clean off your balls at a
hundred paces. You believe me?
Carnegie releases his grip on Solara, steps away, hands up.
CARNEGIE
I believe you. I have to say I'm
surprised to hear that language
coming from you, though. I mean,
you being a holy man and all.
BEAT. Eli glances at Solara.
CARNEGIE
She told me all about it. Told me
all about the bible, too.
(BEAT)
Can I see it?
ELI
No.
Carnegie takes a small step forward. Suddenly, his whole
demeanor changes, and he now looks at Eli imploringly.
CARNEGIE
You know, I've been searching for a
book like that one for years. All
I've ever wanted was to bring the
word of God to these poor
unfortunates here. To shine its
light upon them and give them
something in this wretched world
that they could believe in.
Something to live for! It's why I
built this town, did you know that?
All we've been missing is the word
to show us the way. And now, praise
the Lord, you've brought it to us.
63.
Carnegie takes a step closer. He appears entirely sincere -
but then he is very good at doing so.
CARNEGIE
It's not right to keep that book
hidden away, all to yourself. The
word is meant to be shared with
others. It's meant to be spread!
Isn't that what you want? I could
help you do that. You and me, we
could do it together.
BEAT. Eli seems to be considering what he's heard carefully.
ELI
The Lord himself told me that if I
carried this book west, one day I
would find the place where it was
needed. Where it would be safe.
Where it belonged.
Carnegie smiles broadly... and then with a sudden blur of
movement Eli PISTOL-WHIPS him to the floor.
ELI
But this ain't it.
He turns to Solara and offers her his hand.
ELI
Come on.
Solara enters. Gloomy inside. Comprehensively looted. Empty
shelves coated in thick sheets of dust.
She moves further in, searching for something, anything. But
the place has been gutted. There's nothing. She checks the
wall of dead refrigerators. Shattered glass, all empty.
She's never known desolation and emptiness like this. It's
beginning to scare her. She wheels around in a panic.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Hello?
Distant, calling from outside. Solara hears it and freezes.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Hello? Can anyone help me?
It's like something out of the world before. The interior is
almost perfectly preserved. Chintzy couches. A mahogany
table. A TV set in the corner. Lace curtains. Unreal.
Eli and Solara sit on the couch, feeling self-conscious and
looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment.
George sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them
inhospitably. The shotgun resting across his lap.
Martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a
tea pot and old china cups. Cracked and faded, but intact.
She places the tray on the coffee table and sits.
MARTHA
I'm afraid we don't have any cake
or biscuits for the tea. They ran
out some time ago.
She lifts the tea port and pours into the cups. But it's not
tea, only water. Somewhat murky water. Eli and Solara stare
at the cups, unsure. Martha gestures toward them.
MARTHA
Please.
They raise their cups and take a sip. Martha watches eagerly.
It's clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as
civilized and elegant as serving "tea" to guests.
87.
MARTHA
How do you like it?
ELI
It's.. uh...
SOLARA
It's very good.
Martha smiles, delighted. She lifts her own cup to her lips.
HER HANDS TREMBLE, the cup rattling against the saucer.
ELI
Have you always lived here?
MARTHA
For almost forty years now. This
home is our pride and joy, isn't
it, George?
George just grunts. Not interested in conversation.
MARTHA
We refused to leave, even during
the troubles. We said, didn't we
George, we said if we're going to
die anywhere, we're going to die
right here, in our own home.
ELI
I don't understand how you've
survived out here this long.
MARTHA
Well, George is something of a
handyman, aren't you, dear? He did
a lot of work on the place, making
it safe. We may be old, but we're
resilient. We've had more than a
few who've tried to take this place
from us. Haven't we, George?
GEORGE
Yes. Yes we have.
He stands and moves toward the back door. Opens it up and
beckons Eli and Solara to come look.
Eli and Solara re-enter. Solara looks at George nervously.
He's still carrying that shotgun.
Martha's voice drifts in from the nearby KITCHEN.
MARTHA (O.S.)
I found some meat for those
sandwiches! Are you hungry?
SOLARA
No! Thank you!
ELI
We really must be going.
GEORGE
So soon?
An unnerving glint in his eye. Eli moves toward the door.
ELI
Yes, I'm afraid so.
As he gets to the door, George moves to intercept. Hard to
tell if he's blocking his path or moving to open the door for
him. A tense BEAT.
Martha emerges from the kitchen.
MARTHA
Are you sure you won't stay?
ELI
Yes. Thank you again for the tea.
Eli stares George down. Reluctantly, George steps aside. Eli
opens the door and escorts Solara outside.
George follows them back in, furious.
GEORGE
What did you bring upon us?
MARTHA
George? What's wrong?
GEORGE
A whole convoy of armed
degenerates, that's what's wrong!
Coming here for them! And they led
them right to us!
Martha rushes to the window, pulls aside the lace curtain.
Outside she sees the armored vehicles SCREECHING TO A HALT.
The men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind
them, locking and loading weapons.
MARTHA
Oh no they don't...
She rushes across the room, teeth gritted with determination.
GEORGE
Martha, what are you doing?
MARTHA
I finally got this house just the
way I want it. I'm not going to let
anybody tear it apart!
She goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions.
Underneath is a WOODEN LID which she throws open to reveal:
A HUGE CACHE OF WEAPONS. Automatic rifles. Shotguns. Pistols.
Grenades. And enough ammunition for everything.
91.
She pulls out an M-60 MACHINE-GUN, slings the strap over her
shoulder and locks in a CHAIN OF BULLETS. She looks like a
post-apocalyptic Martha Stewart.
SOLARA
Where did you get all this stuff?
George pulls out an AK-47, slots in a magazine.
GEORGE
Took `em off them who came looking
to take the place from us. Built up
quite the stash over the years.
He offers a .44 MAGNUM to Solara.
GEORGE
You know how to fire a gun?
SOLARA
My daddy showed me once.
GEORGE
Just like riding a bike.
SOLARA
I never rode a bike.
George sighs, turns instead to Eli.
GEORGE
How about you, you know how to-
Eli is already reloading his shotgun, checking the barrel.
Readying the weapon in the practiced manner of an expert.
GEORGE
Never mind.
Eli is crouched beneath the window. George and Martha have
taken up positions at other windows, peering out.
REDRIDGE (O.S.)
That's all we want. The girl and
the book. The rest of you's can go
your way.
SOLARA
What are we going to do?
BEAT as Eli thinks.
ELI
Hand me my pack.
Martha continues firing wildly with the M-60. Screaming at
the top of her lungs, loving every minute of it.
MARTHA
Come and get it, you god-damn sons
of mother-fucking bitches!
George and Eli also open fire from their windows,
periodically ducking to take cover from incoming fire.
Solara sits across the room, in the corner, sobbing.
ELI
It's all right. We're going to be
all right. Trust me.
MORE GUNFIRE splinters the window frame above his head.
ELI
You remember what I told you about
faith?
She nods.
Eli peeks out and FIRES OUT THE WINDOW, dropping one of the
enemy gunmen with a crack shot. Ducks back down as the return
fire impacts around him.
94.
ELI
We're going to get out of this
alive. Both of us. I know.
SOLARA
Because God told you?
ELI
Because God told me.
Amidst all the chaos and gunfire, George has been listening
to this exchange.
GEORGE
What about us?
BEAT.
ELI
He didn't mention you.
BEAT. George chambers a round and RESUMES FIRING.
Filled with smoke. The sounds of COUGHING.
Dazed, George pushes his way through the smoke, waving his
arms to clear it. A BLOODY GASH on his forehead.
GEORGE
Martha? Martha!
He finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the
kitchen. Or at least her top half. The rest of her is gone.
George slumps to his knees with tear-filled eyes. Takes his
wife tenderly by the hand for a moment.
95.
Then the anger returns. He gets up and turns, consumed now by
a wild fury. Firing with rage over the torn brick wall. He
CLIPS ANOTHER GUNMAN IN THE HEAD, killing him.
George moves back toward the LIVING ROOM, firing as he goes.
Eli looks up from cover and see the van coming RIGHT AT HIM.
He dives clear as the van CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE
LIVING ROOM. It SMASHES INTO THE FAR WALL, finally coming to
a stop.
More dust and debris, more coughing. Eli tries to get up, but
winces in pain. Puts his hand to his side, it comes back WET
WITH BLOOD. A bad wound. He covers it with his coat, stands
and moves through the smoke.
ELI
Solara?
SOLARA (O.S.)
Eli!
He finds her in the smoke. She embraces him.
ELI
Are you all right?
96.
SOLARA
I'm fine.
As the smoke clears, Solara sees George PINNED AGAINST THE
WALL BY THE MINIVAN. His body crushed. Dead.
SOLARA
Oh God...
ELI
Come on. We're going out the back.
We're running.
As he helps her to her feet, we hear the sound of MOVEMENT
THROUGH THE RUBBLE.
They turn around. The gunmen are ENTERING THE HOUSE, passing
through the smoking hole left by the minivan.
Eli reaches for his sword. Met by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS
COCKING. Redridge steps out from among the gunmen. Smiles.
REDRIDGE
Go ahead and try it, holy man. You
ain't that fast.
As soon as they step inside they are SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF
HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS. Not U.S. military, more like a semi-
official militia. But every bit as deadly.
Eli and Solara raise their hands. A pair of SOLDIERS take
Eli's pack and sword, pat them both down for other weapons.
SOLDIER
They're clean.
The soldiers before them part - to reveal a THIN, BALDING MAN
wearing spectacles. He wears Kevlar body armor over his tweed
jacket and tie. Professorial, academic.
He approaches, shakes Eli's hand vigorously - very excited.
THIN MAN
Welcome, both of you. I'm Professor
Lombardi. I'm the curator here.
ELI
Elijah Stone.
SOLARA
Solara.
LOMBARDI
Solara. What a delightful name. Is
that by any chance Shakespearean?
SOLARA
I, uh, I think it's Japanese.
LOMBARDI
Wonderful.
He turns back to Eli.
LOMBARDI
Is it true what they tell me? You
have a King James Version?
ELI
Been carrying it with me for twenty-
five years.
Solara looks at Eli, puzzled. Lombardi finds it hard to
contain his excitement.
LOMBARDI
My goodness. I can't tell you how
exciting this is. Well, come, come!
(MORE)
107.
LOMBARDI (cont'd)
I'll give you the nickel tour and
then we can all sit down and take a
look at it.
He leads them across the courtyard into the prison buildings.
What was once a cell block is now an IMMENSE LIBRARY. Stacked
floor to ceiling with books. Lombardi shows Eli and Solara
around. Behind them, a pair of ARMED GUARDS follow closely.
LOMBARDI
Yes, we've been doing this for some
time now. Collected over thirty
thousand volumes from generous
donors all across the nation. We
even have a printing press that we
hope to have operational soon.
Solara is stunned as she surveys the endless stacks of books.
She's never seen anything like it.
SOLARA
You turned the whole prison into a
library?
LOMBARDI
Well, not exactly. We're more like
a storage facility. We're holding
these books here in trust, if you
like. When society gets back on its
feet and no longer needs us to
preserve these volumes, they'll be
here waiting.
(BEAT)
I must ask you, how did you hear
about us? We've been doing
everything we can to get the word
out, but we always like to know
where our benefactors come from.
ELI
I was sent here by God.
Lombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow.
108.
LOMBARDI
Is that right? Well, it's good to
know we're getting such high-
profile referrals these days.
(BEAT)
I must say, I am so excited that we
finally have a King James. You
know, we have a Talmud here, we
have two Korans, we even have that
Scientology book. But never a
Christian bible, until now. I
honestly believed it was the one
book I'd never see again, after
what happened...
BEAT. Lombardi appears sad for a moment.
LOMBARDI
May I ask what condition it's in?
ELI
It's a little beat-up. But it'll do
the job.
LOMBARDI
Well, then. What say we take a look
at it?
Lombardi looks at Eli with anticipation. So does Solara,
interested to know where this is going to go next.
Eli winces in pain, puts his hand to his side.
ELI
Is there someplace we could sit?
LOMBARDI
Of course. Right this way.
Redridge appears. Carnegie looks at him eagerly.
CARNEGIE
Did you get it?
Redridge holds the bible up proudly. Carnegie beams.
CARNEGIE
Show me.
Redridge hands it over. Carnegie sits back in his chair,
running his hand lovingly over the battered leather cover.
109.
CARNEGIE
The new world begins here...
He opens the book and looks inside.
BEAT. And then he looks up at Redridge, confused.
CARNEGIE
What the fuck is this?
Eli, Solara and Lombardi sit at one of the long lunch-room
tables. The two armed guards keep watch nearby.
ELI
Do you have something you can write
with?
LOMBARDI
Mmm? Oh, yes of course!
He pulls a pen from his pocket, motions to one of the guards.
LOMBARDI
Could you please bring us some
writing paper?
The guard nods and moves toward the door. As he does so:
ELI
Bring a lot of it.
Carnegie looks at the open bible, jaw hanging loose, his
complexion ashen. Like he's just been slapped in the face.
REDRIDGE
What? What is it?
The guard brings a THICK SHEAF OF WRITING PAPER to the
cafeteria table, sets it down by Lombardi.
ELI
Are you ready?
LOMBARDI
What exactly am I writing?
110.
ELI
Pay close attention and write down
every word exactly as I say it.
Eli removes his goggles. Solara can't believe what she sees.
His eyes are pale, milky-white, dead. TOTALLY BLIND.
ELI
The First Book of Moses called
Genesis. Chapter one, verse one. In
the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth. Verse two.
The earth was without form, and
void; and darkness was on the face
of the deep. And the spirit of God
was hovering over the face of the
waters. Verse three. And God said,
"Let there be light," and there was
light.
Lombardi hurriedly writes down every word.
Carnegie sits at his desk, still in shock. Eli's bible sits
open on the desk before him.
A BRAILLE BIBLE.
Claudia is ushered in by a guard.
CLAUDIA
What's wrong?
He rushes forward and thrusts the bible into her hands.
CARNEGIE
You told me once that you know how
to read this. This blind language.
CLAUDIA
Well, a long time ago, when I was a
little girl...
CARNEGIE
You're going to read it for me.
Every word. And I'm going to write
it down. Start at the beginning.
As Carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen, Claudia
opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised
lettering.
111.
For a moment there is a glimmer of recognition... a faint
smile... but then it fades as Carnegie turns back to her,
eagerly clutching the writing materials.
CLAUDIA
I'm sorry. It's been so long. I
don't remember. I don't remember
any of it.
Carnegie is aghast. BEAT as the anger swells within him,
threatening to explode...
CARNEGIE
God fucking dammit!
He swipes violently at the bible, knocking it out of
Claudia's hands. He grabs it up and tries to rip it in two,
but it's too thick to tear. Red-faced with rage, he tosses it
out over the box balcony. It lands somewhere in the dark
auditorium below, between the rows of gutted theater seats.
As he paces angrily back past Claudia:
CLAUDIA
Bill, is there something-
CARNEGIE
Just go. Just get out of my sight.
He slumps in his chair, exhausted and furious. Claudia sadly
turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts.
Some considerable time later. Great stacks of paper have been
filled with Lombardi's handwriting.
Lombardi's pen races across the paper, struggling to keep up
with Eli's recitation.
Solara is curled up on a nearby bench, asleep. Eli's coat
covering her to keep her warm.
Eli clutches his wound painfully as he continues to recite.
He looks paler now than ever. Close to death.
ELI (V.O.)
Dear Lord, thank you for giving me
the strength and the conviction to
complete the task you entrusted to
me. Thank you for guiding me
straight and true, through the many
obstacles in my path.
(MORE)
112.
ELI (V.O.) (cont'd)
And for keeping me resolute when
all around seemed lost.
Lit only by the pale moonlight, barely enough to see by.
Carnegie sleeps soundly in bed. Next to him lies Claudia,
wide awake. She checks that Carnegie is sound asleep, careful
not to wake him before she creeps out of bed and exits.
Claudia is on her hands and knees in the darkness, searching
blindly in the aisles and beneath the theater seats.
She finds Eli's bible in some litter strewn on the floor.
ELI (V.O.)
Thank you for the good that I have
done. For whatever light you were
able to shine into the darkness of
this world through me.
Sitting in the darkness, Claudia opens the book and runs her
fingers across the braille, reading. And though we can barely
see in the dim light, we see the smile on her face. The joy.
