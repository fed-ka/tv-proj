TWO MEN emerge from the underbrush at a run. The BIGGER MAN
carrying the wounded SMALLER MAN over his shoulder. Both in
ragged army cadet fatigues - ripped, muddy, and bloody.
The Bigger Man lowers the Smaller Man to the ground and
unshoulders his M-16. Face panicked.
The sound of the HELICOPTER approaching...
2.
As the Helicopter comes in for a landing, the Bigger Man
kneels next to the Smaller Man, who bleeds from a bullet
wound to the arm.
His face, pale, sweating. The Bigger Man
wipes the Smaller Man's brow and speaks softly and seriously.
BIGGER MAN
Are you ready for this?
The Smaller Man nods.
Establishing. A sprawling five square mile compound nestled
in the Louisiana backwoods. Also damaged by the Hurricane.
HELICOPTERS loaded with emergency supplies land and take
off, REPAIR CREWS work feverishly on damaged buildings, all
while CADET PLATOONS complete morning drills around them.
This is still a boot camp after all.
SUPERIMPOSE: 1130 HOURS - FORT MCKINLEY BASIC TRAINING CENTER
Styles stands waiting nervously just beyond the CHECKPOINT
with WARRANT OFFICER JULIA OSBORNE - early 30's, attractive,
close cropped hair and icy eyes. In the middle of protesting.
5.
OSBORNE
This is totally unnecessary-
STYLES
He asked to see a policeman, we're
getting him a policeman .
OSBORNE
But this guy you called, he's not
even Army-
STYLES
He's former Army and the best I've
ever seen in a room. Besides, he
knows the territory, we did Basic
together here.
(off her look)
You've had three hours with Dunbar
and haven't gotten a peep, we need
to take a different tack.
OSBORNE
He's not Army, it's not official-
STYLES
Then it's unofficial.
He takes a hit from an ASTHMA INHALER, as a '71 PONTIAC GTO
drives through the gate and pulls up. Hardy emerges.
OSBORNE
(re: his appearance)
Doesn't get any unofficialer than
that...
The two old friends embrace.
HARDY
How are you?
STYLES
Been better.
(pause)
I read about what's been happening
With you... I should have called-
HARDY
What kind of trouble are you in?
Styles looks at the ground.
Momentarily flustered.
HARDY
That bad?
STYLES
Would I have called you if it wasn't?
If there was any other way-
6.
HARDY
Tell me what I can do.
OSBORNE
You can get us some answers.
Hardy takes off his sunglasses, noticing her.
STYLES
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne,
The closest thing we have to an in-
House investigator.
HARDY
And here you are going out of house.
How's that make you feel, Jules?
OSBORNE
Hostile and uncooperative.
HARDY
Fantastic.
You want to tell me what's
going on?
Row upon row of freshly shaven headed CADETS stand at
attention. Their first day of boot camp.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
First day was when I met Pike.
Sarge
hated him from the beginning.
A man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines.
Two ivory handled pistols on his hips. His lifeless cobalt
blue eyes take in the Cadets. This is SERGEANT WEST.
WEST
You motherfuckers have just made the
worst mistake of your lives! You
have chosen to join my Army! This
Army is my mother, my father, and my
little virgin sister and I will not
allow anyone or anything that is not
up to my standards near her pretty
little virgin cooze, do you understand
me - give me a sir, yes, sir!
THE CADETS
Sir, yes, sir!
17.
WEST
Those who I deem unworthy to pass
through this camp will quit, and
those who refuse to quit I will kill.
You ever hear of a training accident -
Give me a sir, yes, sir!
THE CADETS
Sir, yes, sir!
WEST
In my time I have killed sixteen men
for the good of my country, sixteen
men whose entrance into this Army I
could not condone, as it would weaken
the fabric of this nation's defense!
This base suffers an average of three
training accidents a year, unfortunate
incidents that I will not hesitate
to repeat if you cross me, understand -
Give me a sir, yes, sir!
THE CADETS
Sir, yes, sir!
WEST
So forget what you've seen on Sixty
fucking Minutes about the kinder,
gentler military - you will either
succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
He walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row.
PIKE.
WEST
My power here is absolute, isn't
that right, nigger?
PIKE
Sir, yes, sir!
West hauls off and SLAPS Pike across the face!
WEST
I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi where
we string greasy coon necks up from
tree branches when the mood strikes
us you have a problem with that?
PIKE
Sir, no, sir!
West grabs Pike by the neck, CHOKING HIM. The others Cadets
GASP. Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so
great. He reaches up automatically to try and save himself...
18.
WEST
What the fuck is this? You lay a
hand on me while I'm trying to do my
duty and rid the world of you?
He KICKS PIKE IN THE BALLS and releases him. Pike goes fetal
on the ground, VOMITING, as West stands over him, screaming.
WEST
Get the fuck up, you're still in
formation, get the fuck up!
Pike somehow gets to his feet, vomit streaking his clothes.
WEST
What the fuck have you done to that
uniform, take it off, take it off,
take it off!
Pike, still gasping, can't move fast enough.
West slaps him
again and tears the man's shirt off.
WEST
Get those fucking pants off, I want
you buck ass naked, you don't deserve
to wear these beautiful United States
Army issue clothes!
Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is NAKED.
West turns and spies Dunbar in the line.
WEST
Cadet, what's your name!
DUNBAR
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
WEST
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
DUNBAR
Sir, yes, sir!
West draws one of his PISTOLS and gives it to him.
WEST
Dunbar you are to stand here and
guard this nigger for the next twenty-
four hours! He is not to be given
food, water, or clothes! If he so
much as moves, you are to blow his
nigger brains out, is that clear?
DUNBAR
Sir, yes, sir!
19.
WEST
The rest of you, fallout for
physicals!
The rest of the Cadets fallout, following West away to one
of the buildings, leaving Dunbar and Pike.
One with a gun, the other naked.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Fifteen guys quit that day.
But not
Pike.
The CADETS, navigating a log spanned over a PIT OF MUD.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Time went on and the Sarge started
singling people out.
One of the Cadets, a small man named ANDERSON, falls from
the log. Screaming, West dives into the pit and pulls
Anderson out, knocking him on the head with a pistol.
Anderson stands naked, his arms straining to hold up,TWO
PAINT CANS perpendicular to his body as West berates him.
DUNBAR
He'd zero in on a fella and ride him
till he quit.
Anderson, now in civilian clothes, gets into a TAXI.
Quit.
West, screaming at a weasely looking cadet named CHILDS.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Those who wouldn't quit, he'd put in
what he called Section Eight.
The four Cadets fallout on a run shirtless, with heavy packs
and rifles held over their heads as the rest of the Cadet
Corps files into their barracks for sleep.
DUNBAR ( V. O . )
...and trained long after the other
guys got to turn in.
The Cadet Corps, mustered. West zeroes in on NUNEZ (the
"dead one"), whose t-shirt has a spot on it.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Fellas lived in daily fear of being
Sectioned and with good reason, too.
West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over
towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters.
DUNBAR
They figured we were the boys who'd
meet with a "training accident" .
Nunez takes a place among them.
Looking absolutely terrified.
The six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the
rain. We focus in each face as Dunbar describes them. First
up is MUELLER a tall Aryan looking blonde with a square jaw.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good
ol' boy type. One of those "his
Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull
Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was
gonna take away his scatter gun" .
He idolized West.
Muller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace.
Next to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big
fella from New Mexico. After he got
Sectioned he just followed Mueller
around like a lap dog. He wasn't
mean like Mueller, though, didn't
have it in him.
Next to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
But Childs did. Didn't talk to
anyone, but you got this feeling
something was wrong with him, like
real wrong. Type of guy you felt
uncomfortable going to sleep near.
Behind Childs runs Pike.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Pike I told you about. He took the
brunt of it from Mueller and West.
Once they found it out he was a
convict they were merciless.
(MORE)
22.
DUNBAR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He'd been busted for Auto Theft,
judge gave him the option of jailor
the Army. He made the wrong choice.
Next to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side.
Kendall
is short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing.
DUNBAR
Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was
a smart guy, we got along okay.
Pike and I tried to help him, but...
Kendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West
smacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
He was sickly. Had that shaking
thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
OSBORNE (V.O.)
Epilepsy.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Yeah. Spent half his time in the
infirmary. Only reason he enlisted
was his father. West didn't section
him till last week.
Hardy and Osborne sit in the back of the open car as it
rumbles across the grounds, headed towards the Base Hospital.
They sit in silence until:
HARDY
Why'd you join the army?
Osborne looks at him, annoyed.
OSBORNE
You really want to make banal chit-
Chat like that now?
HARDY
You're right. We should sit in
silence.
OSBORNE
We're in the middle of a murder case-
HARDY
Best time for banal chit-chat.
He slips something into his pocket.
OSBORNE
What is that?
24.
HARDY
Microrecorder for Kendall - didn't
have- time to wire his room. Now
tell me why you joined the army or
I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Osborne smiles in spite of, herself.
OSBORNE
Typical army brat story. Dad was
noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was
never any real doubt of joining up.
HARDY
You had a mobile of bayonets above
your crib.
OSBORNE
Something like that.
You?
HARDY
I lost a bet.
Osborne laughs.
OSBORNE
You're kidding.
HARDY
Yeah. That's just the story I tell
the girls to get them into bed.
Truth is... I don't know. The whole
honor and duty thing. Make a
difference in the world, crap like
that. Didn't really work out.
Osborne studies him.
OSBORNE
I bet
that's the second story you
tell
the girls to get them into bed,
after
you make them laugh with the
first
one.
Hardy just smiles.
OSBORNE
This is the straight hitting on me
you were talking about, isn't it?
HARDY
The very same.
OSBORNE
You do understand that there's
absolutely no way I could ever be
attracted to you, right?
25.
HARDY
I plan to grow on you.
OSBORNE
You're off to a late start.
HARDY
So noted.
They pass an OVERTURNED CLIMBING TOWER.
HARDY
You guys really got the shit kicked
out of you here.
OSBORNE
Imagine what it must have been like
for them out there. What do you
think of Dunbar?
HARDY
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
OSBORNE
What point?
Hardy doesn't respond, instead looking out as they pass the
SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS.
OSBORNE
Something wrong?
HARDY
Being back here. Gives me the
willies.
OSBORNE
Not the happiest of memories?
FLASHCUT TO - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. A bunch of young Cadets,
Hardy and Styles among them, doing forced push-ups by the
barracks in the rain as West randomly berates and KICKS THEM.
BACK TO HARDY - As he looks away and shakes it off.
HARDY
No.
The six cadets, mustered in front of West and a TRANSPORT
CHOPPER. West hands out M-16's, sidearms, and grenades while
yelling above the wind.
WEST
A rifle, a pistol, and three
phosphorous grenades to a man! This
is live fire, so keep those safetied
until we touch down; I don't want
anyone shooting their dick off!
Some chuckling.
WEST
Some of you may have heard there's a
hurricane coming! American soldiers
do not wait for good weather - they
do not wait for a bright sunshiney
day to do their duty! An American
Soldier learns to operate in the
worst conditions and turn said
conditions into an advantage against
their enemy! Anyone who thinks these
conditions are too harsh, feel free
to lay down and die, you get me?
THE CADETS
Sir, yes, sir!
WEST
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin,
you are to split into teams of two
(MORE)
31.
WEST (CONT'D)
and work your way through your
designated area blasting as many
targets as you can find! Each area
has twenty targets, first team to
take all twenty and find the cabin
wins! Teams are as follows - Dunbar
and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall
and Childs!
Mueller groans.
WEST
I will be in the areas monitoring
your progress and if I see anyone
drag ass I will personally slit you
stem to sternum and leave you for
dead! Fall out!
The Cadets board the Transport Chopper. Kendall gets on
last, passing West who leans in and whispers to him:
WEST
You're gonna die tonight, faggot.
We track with Kendall and Childs as they head away from the
Landing Zoe, rifles up, heads down, side by side. Moving
the brush quickly and quietly, eyes scanning for targets.
KENDALL (V.O.)
I knew Childs a little, we worked at
the PX together.
The wind is picking up and it's started to RAIN.
Their
ponchos flap loudly against the elements.
KENDALL (V.O.)
I started getting it in my head that
maybe West had paid him, maybe he
was the one who was supposed to give
me a training accident-
The ROAR of GUNFIRE!
Kendall turns
towards it,
SCREAMING
for a moment... Until he sees Childs
lower his
smoking rifle,
a SHREDDED TARGET on a tree in front
of them.
He looks down,
noticing has his own weapon TRAINED
ON CHILDS.
..
Childs steps forward, knocking Kendall's rifle away.
33.
CHILDS
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
KENDALL
I'm- I'm sorry. . .
Kendall, terrified. Shaking. A beat. Childs picks up the
rifle from the ground and hands it back to him.
CHILDS
Come on, let's move.
VARIOUS SHOTS -- Kendall and Childs, moving through the bayou,
Childs taking out targets. It's raining harder now.
KENDALL (V.O.)
All I could think of was West, out
there somewhere in the dark. Maybe
watching the others, maybe watching
me. And waiting to make his move.
Childs speaks, and Kendall almost jumps out of his skin.
CHILDS
Christ, am I alone in this world?
Shoot something-
A SOUND from the left. Kendall panics, pivots, and FIRES...
Into DARKNESS. No target, no West, no nothing. Kendall,
really freaked out now.
CHILDS
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking
target. What's wrong with you?
KENDALL (V.O.)
I thought I was gonna have an attack.
Go into a fit and bite off my own
tongue in the middle of the bayou.
Childs could tell I wasn't right.
CHILDS
Just safety your shit and get behind
me, okay? I'll take care of this.
Kendall nods and lets Childs walk ahead. Staring at Childs'
back as they move on. On Kendall's face, thinking...
KENDALL (V.O.)
Maybe it was a trick. Maybe this
was when they'd get me, when I felt
safest.
CLOSE. ON KENDALL'S FINGER - Clicking off the safety again.
Moving towards the trigger...
34.
KENDALL (V.O.)
But if I struck first and took out
Childs, then maybe I could make it
out alive...
Kendall raises the rifle.
Sights Childs' back.
A moment
of utter silence and then...
As Kendall safeties his rifle and lowers it... The SOUND of
a tremendous EXPLOSION comes from their right! Kendall and
Childs knocked off their feet as the sky momentarily LIGHTS
UP with the blast as a MAN SCREAMS!
CHILDS
Over there!
Childs points to the right, where the dim shine of PHOSPHOROUS
can be seen through the trees. He drags Kendall to his feet
and the two take off running towards it.
Kendall panting and scared, ducking branches and leaping
ditches as the two sprint towards the dying glow.
CHILDS
Hello!
HEL-
35.
The sound of GUNFIRE!
Childs TACKLES Kendall...
CHILDS
GET DOWN!
They hit the deck, face down in mud. It takes them a second
to realize the shots are not directed at them.
CHILDS
Fuck, what the fuck is going on-
KENDALL
What do we do?
CHILDS
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
He trails off. The gunfire and screaming have stopped.
Silence now, save for the wind and rain.
KENDALL
Don't want to go-
CHILDS
Fine.
Childs rises and heads towards where the sounds were.
Kendall, lying in the rain and mud, shivering.
Alone.
After
a moment he gets up and follows.
The SCORCHED GROUND and TREES smolder under the rainfall.
Kendall finds Childs, standing down by the creek.
Something lies by his feet.
KENDALL
What's-
He stops, seeing.
KENDALL
Oh, Jesus.. .
WEST. Literally spread out on the ground, dead. Eyes open,
face half blackened, he has been ripped in two at the torso.
A horrifying sight. Kendall stumbles back from it.
KENDALL
Did- Did you-
CHILDS
It was the grenade you fucking idiot.
Look at him!
36.
Kendall can't.
He sits, sobbing.
Part horror, part relief.
CHILDS
This isn't our area.
Whose area is
This-
MUELLER
Can anybody hear me!
Childs pivots at the sound of Mueller coming over the ridge.
MUELLER
Hey, I-
(seeing it)
Holy fuck. .,. holy fuck, what the
fuck did you guys do?
CHILDS
We found him like this-
Mueller raises his rifle at the weeping Kendall.
MUELLER
You killed him you fucking faggot-
CHILDS
We found him like this! Kendall was
with me the whole- Listen to me!
Mueller, finally seeming to understand.
Lowering the gun.
MUELLER
Jesus, Jesus fucking Christ...
Muttering to himself, walking in circles.
CHILDS
Where's Pike?
No response.
CHILDS
Mueller, where's Pike?
Mueller looks up.
MUELLER
We got- I don't know, we got separated
CHILDS
Before or after the explosion?
(no response)
Mueller-
MUELLER
I don't know!
37.
KENDALL
How can you not know-
Mueller comes at him, screaming:
MUELLER
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot,
You just shut the FUCK UP-
CHILDS
HEY!
Mueller stops, eyes crazed. Childs looks to the sky, which
is becoming worse by the second.
CHILDS
We have to get out of this.
To find
the cabin.
He helps Kendall to his feet.
KENDALL
What about Pike?
CHILDS
Maybe he'll be there.
Either way,
we have to go.
Kendall nods, slowly.
The two start up the hill.
MUELLER
Shouldn't we- I mean, we shouldn't
just leave him here.
He points down to West's body.
Childs looks at it.
CHILDS
You can carry him if you want.
He and Kendall continue on. Mueller lingers a moment longer
and then turns, following them up the hill.
Kendall, Childs, and Mueller make their way through the bush.
The WIND and RAIN have conspired into a FULL BLOWN HURRICANE.
The three men are practically stumbling now, leaning in
against it to stay on their feet. Kendall spies something
through the maelstrom. It looks like WET WOOD. He points:
KENDALL
There!
THE CABIN -- Wooden, one story, and large, it resembles a
solidly built shack. It is being thrashed by the storm.
38.
The trio stumble towards the front door...
The sounds of RUNNING
and HEAVY BREATHING. Kendall's eyes
flutter open. He's on
Dunbar's back, being carried through
the woods. The sound
of GUNFIRE and a TREE BRANCH SHATTERS
next to them. Someone
is chasing them. Trying to kill them.
Nunez.
43.
Dunbar bobs and weaves as another volley of bullets comes
from behind and we can now hear ROTOR BLADES APPROACHING...
As Dunbar bursts into the sunlight, carrying Kendall.
The entire thing dreamlike, what we saw at the opening, but
from KENDALL'S VIEWPOINT -- the helicopter overhead, Nunez
behind, Dunbar turning and shooting, NUNEZ GOING DOWN...
Hardy and Osborne stand before the Colonel, filling him in.
HARDY
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed
Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
STYLES
Who killed Pike?
HARDY
Someone must have got a shot off.
He wasn't exactly a moving target.
Styles turns to Osborne.
STYLES
What do you think?
OSBORNE
It's too neat.
HARDY
"Too neat." How long have you been
an investigator?
OSBORNE
I don't think that has anything to
do with-
HARDY
That means under a year. Let me
explain what ten years of police
work has taught me - murder is basic.
There are no conspiracies, no grand
mysteries, and no evil puppet masters
behind it all, pulling the strings;
murder is shitty people doing a shitty
thing to other shitty people - it
doesn't always make sense but it's
always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
Osborne struggles to put it into words.
OSBORNE
I just... He came back for Kendall.
I don't think he's capable of murder.
HARDY
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Osborne turns, making her case to Styles.
45.
OSBORNE
Look, all we've got is what Kendall
says, and he didn't actually witness
any deaths except Nunez. He found
West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but
just their bodies - he didn't see
any crime committed.
HARDY
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this
was all going to happen he'd have
Tried harder to witness it for you-
STYLES
West's body isn't in the creek bed.
They stop arguing, turning to look at him.
STYLES
We've already been over the terrain
twice. Nothing.
HARDY
There was a hurricane, Bill, the
wind probably moved it.
STYLES
Habeas Corpus - you have to have a
body to have a crime.
HARDY
Okay, then let's widen the search
'to include the endzone in Giants
Stadium and the trunk of my car-
STYLES
Without the body we have no physical
proof. We need a confession.
HARDY
From Dunbar? I hate to break this
to you, but I don't think he's gonna
be all that psyched to put himself
in for the death penalty.
STYLES
Nevertheless-
HARDY
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will
testify and that'll be enough.
STYLES
Not for me.
A beat. Almost accusingly:
46.
HARDY
You mean not enough to save you.
STYLES
JAG gets here in three hours.
Try
for the confession.
Hardy storms across the grass.
Osborne, still following.
OSBORNE
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just
leave-
HARDY
Watch me.
49.
OSBORNE
You said you owed Styles and now
you're gonna turn your back on him?
Hardy whirls on her.
HARDY
West was a monster! Fifteen years
ago, I was here, I was Section Eight,
I was Pike. Fuck being the knife
dummy- that thing he did, stripping
Pike down, making him stand outside
all night? He did that every year,
he did that to me. Fifteen years
ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm
supposed to care that somebody offed
him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
OSBORNE
You did more than try. You cracked
Dunbar in less than three minutes,
as an investigator you're phenomenal-
HARDY
Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
A beat.
Osborne shakes her head.
OSBORNE
I was starting to believe you, you
know? That you weren't who everyone
Said. I guess I was wrong-
HARDY
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology
bullshit! This isn't my "great second
chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks
I'm a piece of shit cop who took
money and nothing is going to change
that. Nobody will ever know what
happens here-
OSBORNE
But you will.
Hardy stares at her.
HARDY
Why do you care?
OSBORNE
Because it's my job. Because people
are dead. Because of the whole honor
and duty thing, make a difference in
the world, crap like that.
(pause)
We can do this, Hardy.
50.
Hardy looks at the ground.
OSBORNE
Two and a half hours. That's all
I'm asking. Two and a half hours to
maybe get the truth. Silence.
Hardy looks back up at her.
Speaking softly:
HARDY
I didn't shoot West...
OSBORNE
What?
HARDY
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot
West. West wasn't shot, Kendall
said he was blown apart by a
phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never
saw the body.
They stare at each other for a moment...
Mueller and Pike, twenty feet apart, scouring the brush for
targets. Mueller looks to Pike and then slips away...
PIKE (V.O.)
Then Mueller ditches me during the
exercise and heads for the creek.
Mueller stands on the hill and pulls the grenades pin, tossing
it down the embankment. ..
PIKE (V.O.)
He blows the grenade to frame me and
gets West to come running... .
The grenade BLOWS, setting the entire area AGLOW...
Kendall and Childs, turning towards the sound...
Note: Each shot of Kendall and Childs in this sequence should
correspond exactly to Kendall's Flashback.
West emerges from the bush at a sprint.
WEST
What the fuck is going on?!
Mueller runs down the embankment toward him.
59.
MUELLER
Don't know, sir, I-
Six feet away from West, Mueller suddenly raises his rifle
and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
Kendall and Childs, running in the direction of the grenade...
PIKE
Childs' job is easy, he only has to
delay Kendall long enough for Mueller
to get away.
Suddenly MACHINE GUNFIRE shatters the night!
CHILDS
GET DOWN!
He tackles Kendall into the mud.
Mueller, smoking rifle in hand, uniform covered in blood
stands over WEST'S DEAD BODY. He turns and runs off INTO
THE BRUSH. A moment later, Childs and Kendall come into
view at the top of the embankment...
PIKE (V.O.)
Now all Mueller has to do is get rid
of the evidence...
Hours later. The rain has lessened and the Hurricane has
begun to lift as Dunbar pulls himself from the debris.
Hearing a FAINT CRY from his left.
65.
Kendall.
Half conscious, his arm, bloody.
Dunbar slings the man across his shoulders as the rising sun
begins to peak through the clouds overhead.
Dunbar, carrying Kendall towards the clearing when GUNFIRE
comes from behind. He turns to look...
Nunez. The only other survivor from the Cabin. A hundred
yards back, rifle in hand, coming after them with a vengeance.
Dunbar, sprinting towards the clearing, bullets at his heels
and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see a
HELICOPTER OVERHEAD
DUNBAR (V.O.)
And then I killed the last of them.
FLASHCUT TO - Nunez, chest blown open, going down...
Hardy and Osborne, walking and talking.
OSBORNE
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller,
and Nunez know they're going out on
the regular Tuesday Night drill,
hurricane or ho hurricane, so they
plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
HARDY
And they're smart about it. They
know when you commit a crime you
know is going to be investigated,
you need a fall guy and for that to
work, you have to have a witness.
OSBORNE
Dunbar.
HARDY
Exactly, someone who's not involved,
who's word can't be questioned. You
only let them see what you want them
to see, you make them believe, so
when the time comes, they've totally
bought into your version of events.
67.
OSBORNE
They believe the innocent are guilty
and the guilty are innocent.
HARDY
And if they're asked, that's what
they'll tell the, world.
OSBORNE
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong;
Mueller flips out and shoots their
fall guy, which means they have to
bring Dunbar and Kendall into the
Cover story-
HARDY
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but
The hurricane buttfucks the cabin-
OSBORNE
Buttfucks the cabin?
HARDY
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of
Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys
and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
OSBORNE
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall
out from under a house, does the
Senator's son try and get us to put
his savior in the gas chamber?
HARDY
That bugs you too?
OSBORNE
Little bit.
HARDY
Let's go talk to Bill...
Osborne and Hardy, exiting the room.
Whispering:
HARDY
We're fucked, I know-
OSBORNE
They got their stories straight.
HARDY
What?
OSBORNE
What Kendall said - "the type of
guys you don't feel comfortable going
to sleep around." That's what Dunbar
said about Childs to the letter.
HARDY
Are you sure?
OSBORNE
Positive.
Hardy, they planned this.
She grins.
He grins back.
OSBORNE
Not bad for hostile and uncooperative,
eh?
West stands in front of Childs and Kendall, facing them.
Kendall opens his mouth to speak, but Childs steps forward
and raises his rifle, FIRING...
Dunbar pulls Kendall from the cabin's wreckage. As Kendall
begins to talk to him, Dunbar's eyes widen in shock. ..
KENDALL (V.O.)
I told him what had really happened
to West. Told him to keep quiet
about it or I'd destroy him. Because
if it came out that I was involved
with the whole PX scam, my father
would be finished.
The helicopter, hovering overhead. Dunbar, carrying Kendall,
spinning his rifle to face Nunez, sixty yards away. Dunbar
hesitates before firing, not wanting to...
KENDALL
Do it!
Dunbar's rifle ERUPTS...
The sun, beginning to dip in the sky, as Hardy and Osborne
exit the hospital.
OSBORNE
Your car's in the motor pool.
I'll
walk you over.
They walk in silence, for a bit.
OSBORNE
So what now?
HARDY
Now I go home, get drunk, and try
and forget this ever happened.
OSBORNE
Think it'll work?
HARDY
Nah.
They pass a GROUP OF CADETS doing drills.
Hardy, watching
them. Almost looking wistful.
OSBORNE
You know, you never told me why you
left the army.
HARDY
It dawned on me one day that we were
supposed to be a nation founded on
the principle of questioning
authority... and all I did here was
follow orders. It didn't add up.
82.
HARDY [CONT'D)
Plus, I got kicked out.
OSBORNE
For what?
HARDY
That's gonna stay my secret.
CADETS SCATTER as Hardy's car ROARS OUT OF THE MOTOR POOL,
PEELING across the grass towards the far side of the base!
Hardy, white knuckling the wheel, doing his best to steer
around anyone who can't get out of the way in time.
A Large TRANSPORT PLANE sits on the runway waiting as three
M.P.'s and a JAG LAWYER lead Dunbar/Pike (who, for purposes
0 continuity, we will continue to call DUNBAR) out to it.
84.
The SQUEAL OF TIRES as Hardy's car SLIDES around the corner
of the nearest building and SCREECHES to a halt by the plane.
Hardy and Osborne, leaping out, running towards Dunbar and
the M.P.s.
OSBORNE
We need to talk to him-
JAG LAWYER
Sorry, Officer, we have a schedule
To keep-
OSBORNE
We need to talk to him now.
Hardy grabs Dunbar by the arm.
HARDY
We're not finished yet-
DUNBAR
You wanna bet?
JAG LAWYER
M.P.'s, escort this man off the base!
DUNBAR
(smiling)
Sorry, detectives.
Time's up.
As the M.P.'s grab Hardy, dragging him away. Osborne, trying
to stop them. Dunbar, climbing the stairs onto the plane...
Osborne pulls her SIDEARM, levelling it at him as Hardy yells:
HARDY
James Randall Pike, COME ON DOWN!
Dunbar stops at the hatchway. Slowly turning back to them.
Seeing the gun. The M.P.'s release Hardy. Nobody moves.
OSBORNE
Let's go have a talk.
The cadets, climbing aboard the chopper.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
He put us on the chopper and flew us
to his cabin. And then he told us.
Lightning, thunder, and rain as Nunez runs unarmed through
the thick brush.
SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM - The other five fan out, rifles up,
following his trail, ready to kill.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
It was insanity. We were hunting a
man down to kill him.
ON MUELLER
Making his way down embankment, M-l6 out, ready for anything.
From behind him, MOVEMENT...
DUNBAR (V.O.)
He got Mueller first.
Nunez TACKLES HIM at full speed, feet SLIPPING on the wet
hill, and the two TUMBLE head first into a GULLY. Punching,
kicking, biting, anything to stop the other man.
92.
Nunez, CHOKING Mueller as he strains to reach his gun...
MUELLER
Roberto...
With a HEAVE, Nunez SNAPS HIS NECK.
Mueller lies still.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
He took his gun. Used it on Childs.
Nunez spins, seeing CHILDS BEHIND HIM. He DIVES as Childs
fires! Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's
rifle, and SHOOTS - BLOWING CHILDS BACK against the wet rocks.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
I can't imagine what it was like.
Having your friends try to kill you...
Nunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard.
In
agony over what he's just had to do.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
But you do what you have to survive.
Closing his eyes, Nunez steels himself. Wipes the blood
from his hands and climbs out of the gully.
ELSEWHERE
PIKE, creeping through the foliage. Trying to listen for
sounds of movement through the storm. His eyes narrow as he
hears a HIGH PITCHED WHINE...
The bullet hits his forehead dead center.
He crumples.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Nunez in a tree, thirty meters away.
Lowering his rifle.
He climbs down.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple
minutes later.
TIME CUT TO:
Dunbar and Kendall come upon Pike's fallen form. They gaze
down at the uniform emblazoned with the name "DUNBAR".
DUNBAR (V.O.)
It came to me in a split second.
Change clothes, change identities.
If James Pike gets discharged he
goes right back to jail. But if I
was Dunbar, I could walk away from
all this with a new life. But then...
As he reaches down for the uniform, a SHOT RINGS OUT.
93.
KENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm. Dunbar raises his rifle
to find Nunez, standing ten yards away, gun trained on him.
YELLING OVER THE HURRICANE:
NUNEZ
Put it down!
A Mexican stand-off.
The rain continues to fall.
DUNBAR
I just want to go!
Nunez shakes his head.
NUNEZ
You were gonna kill me, Pike!
Thought
you were my friend!
Dunbar, torn. He can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't
surrender either.
DUNBAR
I have to get Kendall to a hospital!
NUNEZ
He was gonna kill me too!
Silence.
The two men still facing each other.
NUNEZ {CONT'D)
I snapped Mueller's neck! He was my
best friend and I had to snap his
neck because he was gonna shoot me
for drugs! For West!
DUNBAR
We don't have to do this! You go
that way, I'll go this way!
Nunez laughs.
NUNEZ
You'll shoot me in the back!
DUNBAR
You killed three people!
Isn't that
enough for one night?
More silence.
Neither moves.
The sky above, a maelstrom.
DUNBAR
I don't want to die out here, Roberto!
Do you?
Nunez, staring at him.
Deciding.
94.
NUNEZ
If you even twitch...
Dunbar nods.
Nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him.
And then Dunbar spies something behind and to the left of
Nunez...
West.
Staring down at him from behind some brush.
Watching.
Nunez, slowly backing away. He pauses as his foot catches
on a fallen branch. Looks away from Dunbar for a split second
to step over it...
West nods to Dunbar as if to say "Go on. . . "
DUNBAR
Forgive me. ..
And Dunbar FIRES.
Nunez, caught by the burst, GOES DOWN. The echo of the
gunshots, swallowed by the storm. Dunbar lowers his head in
agony. West walks down.
WEST
Congratulations, Cadet Pike.
You
get the gold star.
Dunbar stares at his Sergeant through the rain.
DUN BAR
Fuck you.
West smiles.
Tilts his head to Kendall.
WEST
You'd best get him out of here.
Don't worry about the bodies, they'll
be taken care of.
Dunbar doesn't move.
WEST
This is where we part ways, Cadet.
You tell them I died out here, or
I'll come back for you. Tell them
one of the others did me. Mueller,
Childs, I don't care who. You and
Kendall, you tell them a story.
(smiling)
You can tell a story, can't you?
Dunbar doesn't reply.
West laughs and flips him a salute.
95.
WEST
Dismissed.
And West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez.
Giving
Dunbar a clear shot at his back.
Dunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot
the old man...
But he can't.
West disappears into the bayou.
A GROAN from the ground. Kendall. Dunbar's reverie broken,
he leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform...
The aftermath. Flashing blue and red lights from parked
Military Police vehicles illuminate the grounds as M.P. 'S
string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the
building, securing the site for investigation.
Hardy takes in the entire scene from afar. Standing by his
GTO, watching as several M.P.'s finish questioning Osborne.
When she's done she spies Hardy and walks over to him.
OSBORNE
What are you doing out here?
HARDY
Leaving without saying goodbye.
What are you gonna do?
OSBORNE
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget
this ever happened.
HARDY
Think it'll work?
OSBORNE
Nah.
HARDY
Want company?
Osborne smiles.
OSBORNE
A word of advice about women - that
first hour or so after they kill
their boss? Probably not the best
time to hit on them.
HARDY
I should probably write that down.
OSBORNE
Yeah. .
Hardy pulls a card from his pocket and hands it to her.
OSBORNE
Your phone number?
103.
HARDY
In case you need me to testify about
the shooting. They'll clear you.
A beat.
OSBORNE
He was your friend.
HARDY
Yeah. But he was a lot of other
things, too. Thanks.
She nods.
An awkward moment.
Finally:
HARDY
I'll see you.
He turns away.
Walking towards his car.
OSBORNE
Hey, Hardy!
He turns back. She walks up and holds something out to him.
A ten dollar bill.
OSBORNE
I owe you this.
He looks down at the money.
HARDY
You saved my life tonight. Keep it.
(pause)
Actually, don't keep it, I need the
money.
He takes the bill and Osborne laughs. He climbs into his
car and starts it. Grinning at her through the open window.
HARDY
You're one of the good ones, Osborne.
Don't sweat the details.
He puts the GTO in gear and drives off. She watches him go,
then looks down at his card. Smiling. Maybe she will call.
24 hours ago. The hurricane rages. A HAND pulls the PIN on
a phosphorous grenade and CHUCKS IT.
It blows, frying brush and nothing more.
West comes over the hill, running to investigate. He stops
at what he sees. Nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed,
SURROUNDED by the other Section Eight Cadets. A prisoner.
WEST
What the fuck is going on?
DUNBAR
Your weapons, Sergeant.
West doesn't move. Kendall walks over and DISARMS West,
pushing him into the circle next to the terrified Nunez.
105.
WEST
Is this about that little drug
business you all are running? Yeah,
I know about that, Roberto told me-
NUNEZ
Shut up!
Look, we won't say anything-
WEST
Fuck that. You little pissers really
think you can throw a scare into me?
Dunbar raises his rifle and SHOOTS NUNEZ. He goes down,
twitches once and lies still. Dead. West looks at Dunbar.
WEST
You're gonna have to do a lot better
than that, son.
HARDY (O.S.)
How about this?
And with that, Tom Hardy emerges from the brush carrying, a
COMBAT KNIFE. West's eyes sparkle with recognition.
WEST
Didn't I kick your ass out for this
drug thing fifteen years ago?
Hardy just smiles.
WEST
Should've known you were involved in
this. Come on then. Let's see you
try and stick me-
Moving faster than
West thought imaginable, Hardy moves and
the knife FLASHES,
CUTTING WEST OPEN stem to sternum. Hardy
grips the older man
by the shoulders, lowering him to the
ground as he dies.
Whispering in his ear:
HARDY
Stem to sternum. You taught me well,
Sarge.
And WEST DIES. A moment of utter silence and then VOICES
FROM THE PAST begin coming back to us:
STYLES (V.O.)
You think you could explain all this
to me?
Kendall walks over to Hardy and hands him a PISTOL.
HARDY (V.O.)
I wouldn't know where to start.
Kendall holds out his arm, gritting his teeth...
106.
HARDY (V.O.)
I guess it was about one man framing
another...
And Hardy SHOOTS Kendall once, THROUGH THE ARM.
Mueller and Childs lay NUNEZ's DEAD BODY out in the brush.
The sound of the Helicopter approaching...
TIME CUT TO:
Dunbar raises his rifle and FIRES towards the tree line.
Aiming at nothing. The Helicopter comes into view overhead.
DUST KICKS UP around Dunbar and Kendall - bullet hits.
HARDY (V.O.)
When you commit a crime you know is
going to be investigated, you need a
fall guy.. .
ON STYLES' FACE - Watching this through the windscreen.
STYLES (V.O.)
The one who won't talk was trading
live fire with the dead one as we
reached the pick-up.
RACK FOCUS TO - Hardy, concealed in the woods, FIRING at
Dunbar and Kendall's feet to simulate Nunez shooting at them.
Dunbar, shooting towards where Nunez's body lies. Making it
look like he just killed Nunez.
Hardy arriving at the Fort, EMBRACING STYLES.
HARDY
And for that to work, you have to
have a witness...
PAN OVER to OSBORNE, watching.
HARDY (V.O.)
Someone who's not involved, who's
word can't be questioned...
VARIOUS SHOTS -- Of Hardy and Osborne, investigating the
case, talking to Dunbar, talking to Kendall...
HARDY
You only let them see what you want
them to see, you make them believe...
107.
After shooting Styles, Osborne gives her story to the M.P.'s.
HARDY (V.O.)
And if they're asked, that's what
they'll tell the world.
The GTO pulls into a space and Hardy and Dunbar get out.
HARDY (V.O.)
I promised them I'd ask you where
West and the others are...
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Washout rejects, guys he said were
"dumbfucks too stupid to know they
dead"...
HARDY (V.O.)
He's telling the truth up to a
point...
They walk towards the bar's entrance.
HARDY (V.O.)
You can't prove anything until we
find the bodies...
PIKE
All we gotta do is tell the story
right...
DUNBAR (V.O.)
You haven't found any bodies yet,
have you...
As Hardy and Dunbar push through the doors into the bar...
HARDY (V.O.)
WHERE ARE THEY?
Silence.
We slowly move towards Hardy's parked GTO...
HARDY (V.O.)
Murder is basic.
Focusing on the TRUNK...
HARDY (V.O.)
There are no conspiracies, no grand
mysteries, no evil puppet masters
behind it all, pulling the strings.
Dunbar lays the wounded Kendall down as the Helicopter
carrying Styles comes in for a landing. Dunbar wipes the
sweat from Kendall's brow and asks him seriously:
DUNBAR
Are you ready for this?
