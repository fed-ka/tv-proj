First light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed
and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked
with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of
belongings over her shoulder.
She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes,
open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is
running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion.
Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward
until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs.
She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself
on to it. She lands on the road. And runs.
I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH.
The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running
down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an
approaching coach. She flags it down.
Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at
her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod
indicates she can get in.
CUT TO:
Jane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look
shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early
hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her
emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl -
although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear
the day, she closes her eyes.
Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads
meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door.
With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out.
She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open
moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off
at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane
puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is
not there.
She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding
towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost,
alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her.
She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the
gathering dark.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 2.
Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The
night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She
is trying to calm herself with a prayer.
Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun.
She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard
crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised.
Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light
fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand.
Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around
her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her
side, watching her. It is Helen Burns.
Helen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. She
sits up. She is alone.
Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The
sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the
stones. Jane makes no movement.
A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled
with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the
bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches
the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour.
It is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of the
farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen.
CUT TO:
Jane leaning into the pigpen. She picks a stiffened mould
of porridge out of the mud. She lets the rain wash it. She
eats it ravenously.
It has stopped raining. Jane is huddled under a tree. She
is shaking, shuddering. The life has gone out of her eyes.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 3.
The moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks up
at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold.
She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown
walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turns,
looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows.
Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is
struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck.
She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed
against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the
point of despair.
The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her.
Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light
shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling.
Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the
light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning
shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on
the gate.
CUT TO:
Jane is crawling through the narrow garden. On her knees,
she peers through a window.
On either side of a bright little fire sit two young women.
They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in
black. One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides
her gentle eyes behind spectacles. The other, Mary, is very
young; no more than seventeen. Each has a book on her knee.
They are talking intimately.
They look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy
that it pains Jane considerably.
CUT TO:
Jane knocking at the door. Hannah, an old servant answers.
She is suspicious; Jane looks like a wretch.
HANNAH
What do you want?
Jane manages to find her voice.
JANE
Shelter.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 4.
HANNAH
I can't take in vagrants. Here's
a penny. Now take it and go.
JANE
I have no strength to go.
HANNAH
You can move off. And if there
are others with you tell them we
are not alone. We have a
gentleman here, and dogs.
JANE
(DESPERATE)
But I must die if I am turned
away.
The door slams shut. Jane lets out a hopeless wail.
JANE (CONT'D)
God help me. I will die.
She turns away, her hope gone. As she collapses, she finds
herself supported by a strong pair of black-clad arms.
ST JOHN
All of God's creatures must die.
But not prematurely - and not on
my doorstep I hope.
Jane is lifted up. She finds herself looking into the face
of the handsomest man she has ever seen; St John Rivers. He
lifts her over the threshold into the warmth of Moor House.
Jane, aged ten, is sitting cross-legged on an isolated
rock, her eyes locked with those of a stooping black
cormorant. St John's voice comes from a long way away.
ST JOHN (V.O.)
Diana, Mary help me get her
upstairs...
The cormorant raises its wings like a great black cloak.
Jane watches as it takes off and flies away.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 7.
Bessie is waiting with Jane while her belongings are loaded
onto a public coach, its top laden with passengers.
BESSIE
You're such a queer, solitary
little thing. If only you could
make yourself more appealing.
Perhaps if you tried smiling from
time to time, people would find
you more pleasant -
JANE
Don't scold me Bessie. I know you
dislike me -
BESSIE
I don't dislike you Miss; I'm
fonder of you than of anyone.
JANE
You don't show it.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 15.
BESSIE
Miss Jane -
Jane throws her arms around Bessie and embraces her with
great force. Bessie returns the embrace, surprised, moved.
Jane gets into the coach. Bessie looks up at the driver.
BESSIE (CONT'D)
You take good care of her.
Jane's small, pale face peers out of the coach window,
watching Gateshead recede. She doesn't cry. But Bessie
can't stave off her tears.
Jane stands between Diana and Mary high above Moor House.
They are dressed similarly in bonnets and cloaks. They
watch a hawk dive, their heads moving in unison. Their eyes
land upon Moor House.
MARY
We've lived here all our lives but
the house must be shut up now.
JANE
Why?
MARY
We can't afford to keep it on.
Diana and I will return to our
charges in a few days and St John
will go to his parsonage.
Down below them, St John leaves Moor House and walks
towards the village. Jane watches him.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 24.
DIANA
It'll be a hard parting for us. We
may not see him again for years.
JANE
Why ever not?
MARY
He means to be a missionary. He's
going to India to do Gods's work.
JANE
Can he not do God's work here?
MARY
This quiet parish will never do for
him; he almost raves in his
restlessness. It breaks our hearts.
DIANA
St John burns with talents and
ambition. But he lacks the means
for advancement here. Our poverty
thwarts him at every turn and so he
has chosen to lay all his gifts on
God's altar.
MARY
We've tried to persuade him to
stay but in some things our
brother is - he is -
DIANA
Inexorable as death.
MARY
We are now without father. We'll
soon be without home and brother.
Jane feels a powerful compassion for them.
JANE
In one thing you are fortunate.
She looks over at the horizon.
JANE (CONT'D)
You have each other.
Jane is looking at the high wall which is the horizon of
her world at Lowood. Her eyes come to rest on the main
door. Two men are carrying a small coffin out of the
school. Brocklehurst follows it with a menthol-soaked cloth
over his mouth and nose. He becomes aware of Jane's eyes on
him. He looks away.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 25.
Brocklehurst is at the church door; Jane looking at him
coldly. She holds a bunch of wild flowers.
JANE
Yes. Excuse me.
She walks into the graveyard. There are over forty small
graves marked with wooden crosses, each bearing a child's
name. One of them says Helen Burns. Jane lays down her
flowers.
She looks up at Brocklehurst. He cannot meet her eye.
We hear the voice of Mrs Fairfax.
MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
If Jane Eyre of Lowood School...
Jane, younger and more hopeful, with her belongings in a
small trunk, awaits an approaching public coach.
MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
...And if she is in a position to
give satisfactory references, a
situation can be offered where there
is but one pupil, a little girl
under ten years of age and where the
salary is thirty pounds a year.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 30.
Jane is in her scullery putting all her energy into
scrubbing dishes.
MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
Jane Eyre is requested to send
references and all particulars to
Mrs Fairfax at Thornfield Hall.
Jane closes her eyes, trying to banish her thoughts. It is
no good. The memories crowd in.
Jane opens the curtains. She draws her breath in at the
sight of the grounds. They are beautiful.
Jane is on the turreted roof, looking up at the cawing
rooks - and down at the view; a white, frosted wilderness.
Jane senses a presence behind her. She quickly turns. Mrs
Fairfax is coming through the rooftop door.
MRS FAIRFAX
I thought I might find you up here.
I've been waiting to pour our tea.
JANE
I'm not in need of tea, thank you.
Mrs Fairfax approaches, concerned.
MRS FAIRFAX
What is it, child? You've been
here three months now and I'm
worried that the position is not
enough / to occupy your -
JANE
Oh, Mrs Fairfax, no. I'm so
thankful to be at Thornfield.
Please don't think I'm so
ungrateful as to be discontented.
MRS FAIRFAX
But it's a quiet life, isn't it?
This isolated house; a still doom
for a young woman...
Jane looks out at the view once more.
JANE
I wish a woman could have action
in her life, like a man. It
agitates me to pain that the sky-
line over there is ever our
limit. I long sometimes for a
power of vision that would
overpass it. If I could behold
all I imagine... I've never seen
a city, never spoken with men.
I've never even seen a town of
any size. And I fear my whole
life will pass, without ever
having...
Mrs Fairfax's troubled look makes Jane fall silent. Mrs
Fairfax looks as if she is about to say something - then
puts on her practical face, the moment of intimacy gone.
MRS FAIRFAX
Well now - exercise is a great
cure for anything, they say.
(MORE)
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 37.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
I have some letters to post; will
you take them?
Jane is walking with purpose, carrying a bundle of letters.
The exercise is lifting her spirits. The sun is sinking,
turning the frost gold.
A brook runs close to the path; half frozen. Its slow
trickle is the only sound to be heard. Jane moves slowly,
acutely aware of everything around her.
Further into the wood, the brook has frozen right across
the path. Jane slips on it as she passes. The noise of her
feet echoes. She steadies herself.
She gazes at a huddle of snowdrops, their heads bowed. A
crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and
begins to freeze as she watches. It is held suspended as if
the whole winter is contained in it.
The moon is mounting the sky. Jane hears a sound like the
beating of wings. The blood is rushing through her ears.
Her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog - which
glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet.
The beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the rush
of an approaching horse. It is almost on top of her before
she can move. Her shocked, pale face, her black garments
startle both horse and rider.
ROCHESTER
What the deuce -
The rider gets the horse under control and continues, only
to have his horse slip on the ice. Both man and horse fall
with a crash. The dog begins to bark, until the hills echo
with the sound. The horse is on one side; the man is lying,
trapped beneath it on the ice; Edward Fairfax Rochester.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Hellfire.
Jane is confounded.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Pilot, get down! GET DOWN I SAY!
JANE
Can I do anything, sir?
Rochester stares at her; a tiny black figure, surrounded by
darkening frost, the low moon behind her.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 38.
ROCHESTER
Get back.
Jane doesn't move. Rochester turns to his horse.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Mesrour. Mesrour.
With much stamping and clattering, the horse clambers to
its feet. Rochester seems relieved.
He tries to stand himself. His ankle will bear no weight.
He lets out an involuntary cry. It echoes:
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Damnation.
JANE
Are you injured, sir?
Rochester looks at her once more. He manages to get himself
off the ice. He sits on a nearby stile. Jane approaches
him. She now has the moon on her face. She begins to look
less like a phantom and more like a girl.
JANE (CONT'D)
If you are hurt and want help I
can fetch someone from the
village. I'm on my way there to
post a letter.
Rochester looks as if he doesn't believe her.
ROCHESTER
Where do you come from?
JANE
Thornfield Hall.
ROCHESTER
Whose house is that?
JANE
Mr Rochester's.
ROCHESTER
Do you know Mr Rochester?
JANE
No, I've never seen him.
Rochester is trying to place her. She is a puzzle to him.
ROCHESTER
You're not a servant there...
JANE
I am the governess, sir.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 39.
ROCHESTER
The governess.
(A slow smile)
Deuce take me, I had forgotten.
Examining Jane once more, he laughs a low laugh.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
The governess.
Jane does not like to be laughed at.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Have you got an umbrella I can
use as a stick?
JANE
No.
ROCHESTER
Then try to get hold of his
bridle and lead him to me.
Jane doesn't like his imperious tone. She looks at the
horse; huge, trampling, nervous. Rochester is amused.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
If you would be so kind...
Jane obeys. She endeavours to catch the bridle but the
horse rears away. Jane falls on the ice. Rochester bursts
out laughing. Jane picks herself up.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Perhaps it would be easier to
bring me to the horse. Come here.
Jane resists.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Forgive me. I must beg of you to
come here.
Jane approaches. Rochester instantly leans all his weight
on her. She almost crumples under it; the first time she
has ever touched and been touched by a man. She holds him
up. And walks him closer to his horse.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Mesrour.
The horse approaches him. Rochester calms it. He springs
into the saddle, grimacing as he wrenches his sprain.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Thank you.
(He bows.)
Now, make haste with your letter.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 40.
Rochester's spurred heel makes the horse start and rear.
Jane steps back. The horse bounds away, the dog rushing in
its traces. All three disappear.
Jane doesn't move until the sound of hooves has faded away.
Her face is flushed, her eyes glitter in the dark.
I/E. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE FRONT ENTRANCE/HALL.
Jane runs up to the front door. She pushes it open. To her
amazement, there is a fire burning in the stone fireplace.
The whole hall is lit. The double doors are open into the
library. Mrs Fairfax is hurriedly approaching.
MRS FAIRFAX
Mr Rochester is here.
JANE
Oh?
MRS FAIRFAX
Go and change your frock; he wishes
to meet you.
JANE
I have to change?
MRS FAIRFAX
Oh yes - I always dress for the
evening when Mr Rochester is here.
JANE
But all my dresses are the same.
MRS FAIRFAX
(DESPERATELY)
You must have one that is better?
He's in a terrible humour; the
doctor has been. His horse fell
in Hay lane and his ankle is
sprained.
Mrs Fairfax anxiously hurries back into the library. A
large dog wanders out. Jane finds herself looking at Pilot.
She smiles.
Jane is playing battledore and shuttlecock with Adele. Her
playing is full of energy, very free. Her cheeks looks
almost rosy. It is spring.
JANE
Just as it turns to come down -
that's when you hit it.
Adele serves. The game continues apace. Rochester wanders
out of the open double doors of the library. He watches.
Something lands at his feet. A rook's feather. He looks up
at the battlements. A shape disappears, too fast to see.
Rochester's features cloud over with an expression of shame
and detestation. He stands in a terrible inner conflict.
Jane notices him - she misses her shot.
JANE (CONT'D)
Mademoiselle has got to rest.
ADELE
Because I start to win!
JANE
Have mercy, Adele. Play with
Pilot for a while.
Rochester is leaning over the balustrade, his head bowed.
JANE (CONT'D)
Is our game disturbing you, sir?
He looks up. A hard and cynical expression has mastered his
countenance, something resolute. Jane is taken aback.
ROCHESTER
On the contrary. I like your game.
I like this cold, hard day. I like
Thornfield.
Rochester picks up the black feather. He starts to walk
across the grounds at a fast pace. Jane follows.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
I've been arranging a point with
my destiny, Miss Eyre. My destiny
stood up there by that chimney,
like one of the hags who appeared
to Macbeth. 'You like Thornfield?'
She said. 'Like it if you dare'.
Well, I dare. It's felt like a
plague house for years -
He turns, the whole house now in his sights. He shouts:
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 51.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
But Thornfield is my home and I
shall like it!
Adele is running after them.
ADELE
Mademoiselle - Il faut jouer -
Rochester snaps at her with shocking ferocity.
ROCHESTER
Get back! Keep at a distance
child, or go in!
Adele's face crumples into tears. Rochester sees Jane's
shock at his outburst. He walks away.
Jane isn't sure whether she has been dismissed or not.
Adele has run back to Pilot. Jane watches her. She suddenly
finds Rochester is back at her side. He walks her along.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
She's the daughter of an opera
dancer, Celine Varens. Celine was a
beauty and she professed to love
me. Her ardour was so great that,
ugly as I am, I believed myself her
idol. So I installed in her in a
hotel, gave her servants, gowns
cashmeres, diamonds - in short, I
was an idiot.
JANE
To fall in love, sir?
ROCHESTER
You've never felt love, have you
Miss Eyre? Your soul still sleeps.
JANE
Does it?
ROCHESTER
You're still floating gently in
the stream of life, unaware of
the rocks ahead waiting to dash
you to pieces.
JANE
Were you dashed to pieces, Mr
Rochester?
ROCHESTER
Not by Celine. How can one ever
truly love a woman one has paid
for?
(MORE)
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 52.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
It ended when I visited her
unexpectedly one night and caught
her with her handsome, charmless
lover. I overheard her waxing
lyrical on all my defects - she was
mercenary, heartless, senseless.
The whole intoxication fell away
like a dream. I left her money to
support the little French floweret
over there, whom she swore blind
was mine. I see no proof of my grim
paternity in her features; I think
Pilot is more like me than she.
JANE
But you took her on?
Adele is curled up, seeking comfort from the dog.
ROCHESTER
Some years later, I heard that
Celine had abandoned the brat,
disappeared to Italy and left it
destitute. So I lifted it from the
mud and slime of Paris and brought
it here, to grow up clean in the
wholesome soil of an English
country garden. My one good work in
a sea of countless sins.
Jane is looking at Adele full of compassion.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
You listen, Miss Eyre, as if it was
the most usual thing in the world
for a man like me to tell stories
of his opera-mistresses to an
inexperienced girl like you. Adele?
Adele looks up. Rochester speaks graciously.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Forgive me; for keeping Miss Eyre
from your game for so long.
Adele is immensely gratified by his apology.
A carriage waits. Rochester lifts Mason in to Dr Carter.
Jane hands in Mason's great coat. She stands back.
ROCHESTER
I'll ride over tomorrow to see
how you do. Goodbye, Richard.
MASON
Fairfax - Let her treated as
tenderly as may be -
ROCHESTER
I do my best and have done it and
will do it!
The carriage goes. Jane prepares to go inside but Rochester
walks her towards the orchard.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Come, Jane. That house is a
dungeon, don't you feel it?
JANE
It seems to me a splendid
mansion, sir.
ROCHESTER
It is slime and cobwebs.
The orchard is a different world; the dawn light
illuminating dewy trees. Rochester is silent. Jane is
trying to fathom him.
JANE
Will Grace Poole stay here now?
ROCHESTER
Oh yes, don't trouble your head
about her.
JANE
But sir -
ROCHESTER
Grace Poole is not the danger.
He walks off, pulling the heads off flowers as he passes.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
You've noticed my tender feelings
for Miss Ingram?
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 73.
JANE
Yes sir.
ROCHESTER
Keep vigil with me again, the night
before I marry. For now you've met
my lovely one and you know her.
She's a rare one, isn't she?
JANE
Yes sir.
ROCHESTER
A strapper, a real strapper; big
and buxom...
He throws a cankered rose across the orchard. Jane manages
to articulate her anxiety.
JANE
I'd do anything for you sir,
anything that was right.
ROCHESTER
(GENTLY)
And if I ever bid you do what was
wrong, you'd turn to me, quiet
and pale and say 'I cannot do
it.' And you'd be as immutable as
a fixed star.
Rochester, gazing at her, seems to have decided something.
He turns a corner and is gone. Jane is left alone. We hear
the sound of a blow.
A coach pulls up in the lane near Thornfield. Jane gets
out. We hear her voice.
JANE (V.O.)
My dear uncle, some years ago, my
Aunt Reed mistakenly informed you
that I had died.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 79.
Jane is walking through the wooded glade where she first
met Rochester. All is green and verdant and bathed in
sunset light. There seems to be life everywhere.
JANE (V.O.)
I am writing to tell you that I
am very much alive and living at
Thornfield Hall, where I am
currently governess to the ward
of Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester -
ROCHESTER (O.S.)
There you are.
Jane turns. Rochester is sitting on the stile where they
first met. For a moment, her every nerve is unstrung.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Just like one of your tricks to
steal into your home along with
the twilight. Where the deuce
have you been this last month?
JANE
I have been with my aunt sir, who
is dead.
Rochester laughs.
ROCHESTER
A true Janian reply. If I dared
I'd touch you, to see if you were
real...
Jane puts out her hand. Rochester takes it. He helps Jane
over the stile.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Go home - stay your wandering
feet at a friend's threshold.
Jane lets go of his hand.
JANE
Thank you Mr Rochester. I'm
strangely glad to get back again to
you. Wherever you are is my home.
Jane, knowing she has said too much, turns and runs over
the fields towards Thornfield.
Jane is alone, drinking in the beauty of the evening -
looking at the gardens as if she may never see them again.
She turns a corner and sees Rochester staring intently at
something. His back is to her. She is about to tiptoe away.
ROCHESTER
Come and look at this fellow, Jane.
Jane approaches, wondering how he has sensed her presence.
Rochester is looking at a huge moth.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Look at his wings. He looks West
Indian - I have never seen one
like him, here. There; flown.
They watch the moth as it flies towards the house.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Thornfield is a pleasant place in
summer, isn't it?
JANE
I'll be sad to leave it.
ROCHESTER
Yes, but it can't be helped. I
soon hope to be a bridegroom.
JANE
Have you found me a new situation,
sir?
ROCHESTER
A situation, yes of course. It's
the least I can do for a faithful
paid subordinate such as yourself.
You're to undertake the education
of the five daughters of Mrs
Dionysus O'Gall of Bitternut Lodge,
Connaught.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 81.
JANE
Connaught?
ROCHESTER
You'll like Ireland. They're such
warm-hearted people, they say.
JANE
It is a long way away, sir.
ROCHESTER
From what?
JANE
From here. From you.
ROCHESTER
We've been good friends, Jane
haven't we? But with the Irish sea
between us you'd soon forget me.
Jane's great distress escapes her.
JANE
I wish I could. I wish I'd never
come here. I love Thornfield -
I've lived a full life here. I've
not been trampled on or petrified
or buried with inferior minds.
I've talked face to face with what
I reverence, with what I delight
in. I've known you Mr Rochester -
ROCHESTER
Then why must you be torn from me?
JANE
Because of your bride.
ROCHESTER
I have no bride.
JANE
But you will have.
ROCHESTER
Yes, I will.
JANE
Then I must go.
ROCHESTER
You must stay.
JANE
Do you think I could stay to become
nothing to you? Am I an automaton,
a machine without feelings?

Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 82.
JANE (CONT'D)
Do you think that because I am
poor, obscure, plain and little
that I am soulless and heartless?
ROCHESTER
JANE -
JANE
I have as much soul as you and full
as much heart. I'm not speaking to
you through mortal flesh. It's my
spirit that addresses your spirit
as if we'd passed through the grave
and stood at God's feet, equal - as
we are.
Rochester takes Jane in his arms.
ROCHESTER
As we are.
Jane struggles away from him.
JANE
Let me go.
ROCHESTER
NO -
JANE
I'm a free human being with an
independent will, which I now
exert to leave you.
Rochester releases her. She stands in front of him.
ROCHESTER
Then let your will decide your
destiny. I offer you my hand, my
heart and a share of all this.
He gestures towards the house, the land. Jane is stunned.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
I ask you to pass through life at
my side. Jane, you are my equal
and my likeness. It is you I
intend to marry.
JANE
Are you mocking me?
ROCHESTER
Do you doubt me?
JANE
Entirely.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 83.
ROCHESTER
You have no faith in me?
JANE
Not a whit.
ROCHESTER
You little sceptic.
JANE
Your bride is Miss Ingram -
ROCHESTER
What love have I for Miss Ingram?
What love has she for me? I
caused a rumour to reach her that
my fortune was lost and got
instant coldness. I wanted to
make you jealous, to move you to
love me. It's you - you strange,
unearthly thing. I love you as my
own flesh. You - poor and obscure
as you are - please accept me as
your husband.
Jane begins to believe him.
JANE
Are you in earnest?
ROCHESTER
I must have you for my own.
JANE
You wish me to be your wife?
ROCHESTER
I swear it.
JANE
You love me.
ROCHESTER
I do.
JANE
Then sir, I will marry you.
They embrace.
Neither Jane nor Rochester moves. Darkness is almost
complete. Still the intensity of the embrace is held.
ROCHESTER
It will atone. It will atone.
A sheet of lightning momentarily lights up the sky. Some
moments later a distant rumble of thunder.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 84.
I/E. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE FRONT HALL
It is teeming with rain. Rochester and Jane run to the
front entrance. He holds his jacket around her. Lightning.
They reach the dry hearth inside. Thunder. They are both
euphoric, breathless, laughing.
JANE
I must go.
ROCHESTER
Good night. Good night.
He kisses her. They kiss again. Jane will not let him go.
JANE
Good night.
As Jane runs upstairs she sees Mrs Fairfax, deeply shocked.
Jane is waiting, pale with anxiety. A man on horseback
approaches, a great dog at his side; Rochester. He is
grinning.
He pulls Jane up on the horse in front of him. She curls
into his arms, desperate for his comfort and his strength.
Rochester senses something is wrong. He slows the horse.
ROCHESTER
What is it?
JANE
I'm afraid.
Rochester, grimly resolute, is striding at a pace Jane can
hardly follow. Her satin shoes are muddy. She is becoming
breathless. A rook flies over their heads, cawing.
Rochester is striding purposefully towards a small church
of ancient design. Jane stumbles. Rochester is contrite.
Jane tries to collect herself. She looks up to the sky. The
rook wheels around the spire. She takes Rochester's hand.
Jane lies curled up on a rock at the bottom of a dried-up
river bed. All of nature is suspended in stillness.
Far away, we hear the sound of a flood loosened in the
remote mountains. We hear the sound of the torrent
approach.
Jane doesn't move. She has no will to flee. The sound of
rushing water pounds in her ears. She lies, waiting to be
dashed away. We see the flood approach and hit. A dazzling
whiteness of water and foam.
First light. Jane is running; flushed, breathless, her
dress soaked with dew. She has her bag of belongings over
her shoulder. She trips; falls to her knees.
She looks back. For a moment she seems paralysed. She
returns her gaze to the route ahead. Her need to escape is
so great that she crawls forwards until she is able to
raise herself to her feet.
She reaches the stile; lifts herself on to it; puts her
arms around the post. She holds it, as if it were beloved.
Her eyes close. We hear the sound of a winter blizzard.
Jane, Diana and Mary are running over the moors. Mary has a
kite. They are as delighted as children.
A glorious summer sunset. Jane is digging at a flower bed,
putting all her passion into the task. She is flushed with
exertion. St John watches.
ST JOHN
You are wasted here.
JANE
Am I not being useful?
ST JOHN
You should look beyond Moor
House, beyond the selfish calm
and comfort of affluence.
JANE
Beyond to what?
ST JOHN
I go to India in six weeks.
JANE
So soon? -
St John draws Jane away from her work.
ST JOHN
I can see what your gifts are and
why they were given. Come with me.
Jane is utterly crestfallen.
ST JOHN (CONT'D)
God and nature intended you for a
missionary's wife. You are formed
for labour not for love. I want
to claim you - not for my
pleasure but for God's service.
JANE
I'm not fit for it. I have no
vocation.
ST JOHN
You're far too humble.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 109.
JANE
St John have mercy. I feel my
mind shrinking -
ST JOHN
Don't be afraid. You are diligent,
faithful, docile, courageous,
gentle and heroic. Cease to
mistrust yourself. I trust you
unreservedly. Let me give you time
to think. But know this; in you, I
recognise a fellow soul, a soul
that would revel in the flame and
excitement of sacrifice.
Jane is chilled to the bone by his words. St John leaves
the garden and walks away over the moors.
CUT TO:
Jane leaning against the garden wall, trying to think,
trying to compose herself. The sun is setting.
Jane runs on to the moors.
JANE
Wait for me!
She looks all around her at the moonlit landscape.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 113.
JANE (CONT'D)
Where are you?
The moors send her question back in an echo. We see Jane's
face. Her path is clear.
Jane is waiting for the coach at the crossroads where she
arrived, almost a year before. It comes pounding towards
her. She hails it. This time, the coachman respectfully
descends to take her bag and help her on. She is so
confident and so changed that he doesn't recognise her.
Jane is walking through the orchard. It is wild, neglected.
Its untended state worries her. She looks up. Rooks are
circling, cawing.
CUT TO:
Jane finds herself at the side of the house. The ground is
pitted with weeds. The windows are dark. She half runs
round to the front. What she sees takes her breath away.
The great walls and battlements are blackened with fire.
Windows gape on a hollow shell. The inside of the house has
collapsed. Through the hanging door, only its charred
remains can be seen. Weeds grow through utter devastation.
Jane gazes in horror and distress.
I/E. DAY. MRS FAIRFAX'S COTTAGE
Jane knocks on the door. Mrs Fairfax opens it.
JANE
They sent me from the inn. I've
been up at the house -
Jane can say no more.
MRS FAIRFAX
Come in, come in.
JANE
Is he dead?
Mrs Fairfax takes Jane in her arms.
MRS FAIRFAX
No, no. Mr Rochester still lives.
Jane is crying tears of relief.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 114.
JANE
Tell me - please -
MRS FAIRFAX
Why did you run away in the night
like that? I would have helped. I
would have helped.
Rochester, in his shirt sleeves, is looking at the tree
where Jane promised him her hand - now dying, cleft by
lightning. The rising moon inhabits the sky.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 115.
MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
It was harvest time when it
happened. No one knows how she
got out.
Rochester hears a cry from the top floor. He sets off, a
look of finality on his face.
Bertha is watching the rooks. Rochester goes to the edge of
the roof. Bertha looks at him. The invitation is clear.
Rochester is ready to die.
Bertha sees the rooks wheeling away. She runs at the edge
of the roof. Rochester sees her intention too late. He puts
out his arm to stop her.
For the perfect fraction of a second, Bertha flies.
Rochester sees her fall; almost falls himself - saves
himself.
Life reawakens in him. Behind him, he sees Grace Poole,
coughing, crawling up through the door.
GRACE
Antoinetta?
Responsibility floods over him. He goes to her side, lifts
Grace, helps her down the stairs.
MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
He didn't leave the house until
everyone was out. Some say it was a
just judgement on him for having
her confined there all those years
but for my part, I pity him.
Jane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track.
Her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end. She comes
to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between
granite pillars. She walks through them.
She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan manor
house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow
grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops.
Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He
is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart,
brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking
sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a
hawk. His strength is undiminished.
He walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into
the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough
for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him,
silent.
A few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his
right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky
as if he is looking for something from there. He is
absolutely still; his expression, serene.
Jane is very close. She steps on a twig. It breaks with a
loud crack, shattering the silence. Rochester is
immediately on guard, his expression turning wary.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 118.
He suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of
it passing an inch from her face. Jane steps back.
Rochester swipes again. She holds her breath.
He seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. He turns
and walks fifteen paces back to the house. He disappears
into the dark interior.
Jane starts to breathe again.
Jane lightly taps on the side door. Martha opens it; she is
astonished. Jane puts her finger over her lips.
