      They go after him. He cuts down a NARROW PATH along some 
      public housing units and plows straight through a CHAIN-LINK 
      FENCE, knowing just where to hit it. Ben and Sammy do the 
      same but get scratched to shit. They come out in an ALLEY and 
    see him sprinting for an OPEN GARAGE at the rear of a house --  

                                  SAMMY
                    I got the front!

      Sammy hops a low fence and runs toward the front of the house 
    to cut him off. Ben pursues the guy into the garage.   


      After banging into a table toppling food and plastic lawn 
      chairs, Ben suddenly stops. He s facing 20 GANGSTERS having a 
      BBQ, as the asshole he was chasing leaps a fence and 
      disappears. MUSIC THUMPS. They ve all been drinking. CAMERA

      Lydia reluctantly lets her in, wincing at the smell of her.

      down too. Some PASSERS-BY SCREAM and run inside a store, as --

                    Give his ass a ticket. I told him 
                    to stop textin  while he s drivin . 
                    And he gonna have to pay for it,

                    that?  

      John has pretty much relaxed by now, but Tang s at the SUV, 
      making sure there are no other occupants...

                          (to woman, mock stern)
                    He refused to exit his vehicle, 
                    ma am, and was speaking 
                      disrespectfully. 

                                  IMPOSING WOMAN
                    Well I am sorry for that, Officer, 
                    I have truly done my best.

                    That is the last time you drive that 
                    car, boy, you hear? All I done for

                    we ll get him that ticket and be on 
                    our way.   

      Momma moves aside, but in b.g. her RANT CONTINUES, just 
      withering, as Tang and John meet eyes...

      I./E. BEN & SAM S CAR (MOVING)/PRESCHOOL - ST./ALLEY - DAY1818

      Ben and Sammy (Sammy driving) are hauling ass, Code 3, trying 
      to pin-point the location of MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS we re hearing. 
      They ZOOM past a side-street, an alley, SCANNING, and then...   * 

                                  BEN
                    Back, back up! The alley! Put your *
                    glasses on, man!   *

      Sammy SLAMS the breaks, BURNS RUBBER in reverse. DOWN THE 
      ALLEY we see a GANGSTER and his RIVAL shooting at each other 
      with handguns. Sammy SCREECHES off into the alley, just as --    

      They see the Rival s head take a bullet and practically fly 
      apart. The Gangster runs off. Sammy GUNS IT, throwing on his *
      glasses, and they chase him... past cowering CITIZENS, till  *
      they get to the front of a PRESCHOOL. As they SKID UP, they  *
      watch the Gangster run inside.             SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                15.



    Ben and Sammy jump out, Ben grabbing the shotgun. Freaked-out 
      BYSTANDERS are SHOUTING and pointing inside. 

      Dewey and his PARTNER skid up now too, as suddenly, TEACHERS 
    and SMALL CHILDREN pour down the steps SCREAMING in terror. 

    Our cops run through them, to the steps, and see a TRAIL OF 
      BLOOD leading up to the front door.  

                                  DEWEY
                          (to his partner)
                    Set up a perimeter! Request Swat!   

                                  SAMMY
                    There s kids in there. 

      Sammy, Ben, and Dewey move up the stairs till they get to the 
      FRONT DOOR, half ajar and swaying ominously. They all meet 
      eyes, and then --   

                                  SAMMY (CONT D)
                          (mouthing it)
                    One, two, three -- 

      They move swiftly inside, as we -- 

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      John and Tang get coffees and head to their car. Tang s nose 
    is buried in her phone checking the  net... John stopping as 
    she lags behind.   

                                  JOHN
                    Guy next to me in the hospital, 
                    when I was post-op? Broke his neck 
                    like that. Flipped over a fire 
                    hydrant -- 

                                  TANG
                    Shh, just hold on... good, okay. 
                    Truck Norris ll be on Franklin at 
                    one.

                                  JOHN
                     Truck Norris? 

                                  TANG
                    I eat there on Wednesdays, you ll 
                    love it. Hawaiian Filipino fusion.  

                                  JOHN
                    How s their pastrami? 

                                  TANG
                          (flat smile)
                    Try not to embarrass me.  

                                  JOHN
                          (as they land at the car)
                    How d you get stuck with this crap *
                    detail? Baby-sitting the guy just 
                    back from humping the pine? 

                                  TANG
                    I requested you. 

                                  JOHN
                    Why s that? 

                                  TANG
                          (shrugs)
                    Got tired of getting hit on, and 
                    knew you wouldn t be a problem. 

                                  JOHN
                          (thrown again)
                    Oh, yeah? 

                                  TANG
                    Heard that you were squared-away. 
                    Why? You planning on groping my 
                    thigh? 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)            SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                18.

      John eyes her, and again, she just looks back with innocence. 
      Does she know he s gay, or was that really a kind of 
      compliment? As they pop their doors, about to climb in -- 

                                  TANG (CONT D)
                    I have an issue with your tactics 
                    at that last stop.  
                          (off John, oh really?)
                    You let your guard down after that 
                    woman exited the SUV.   

                                  JOHN
                    I saw her through the windshield 
                    and determined the threat was low. 

                                  TANG
                    The side windows were tinted, there 
                    could ve been other occupants. You 
                    should ve alerted to that. 

    A weird beat; John knows she s right. She s out-John-ing John. 

                                  JOHN
                    Okay. Point taken. 

      Tang nods, cool, as BACK AT THE COFFEE SHOP -- A COMMOTION. 
      An ANGRY CUSTOMER, something a bit  off  about him, is making 
    a scene about his bagel, as the WAITRESS tries to deal.

                                  ANGRY CUSTOMER
                    Go ahead, bite it -- this thing is 
                    like a rock. The sign says fresh 
                    baked goods. 

                                  WAITRESS
                          (deliberately loud)
                    Sir, calm down, or I m gonna call 
                    over those cops.

    The man looks over, LOCKING EYES with John and Tang. Long 
      beat. He backs down. He SLAPS some money down on the table 
    and goes to his nearby parked CAR. Jumps in and drives off... 

                                  TANG
                    Someone had too much coffee. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Sammy, Ben, and Dewey walk toward the body of the GANGSTER S 
      RIVAL, his head canoed from a bullet at close range. No 
      yellow tape yet, no Coroner s van. TWO 8 YEAR OLDS with 
      sticks LAUGH nervously and poke at the guy s brains, SMOKE 
      STILL RISING.   

    ON BEN -- seeing Ferguson... just standing there blankly 
      watching, wad of tobacco in his cheek. Ferguson spits. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)            SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                19.

                                  BEN
                    He s screwing up the crime scene. 

                                  SAMMY
                    It s not that big a deal. 

                                  BEN
                    What? What are you talking about? 

    Ben moves off toward Ferguson, as Sammy and Dewey trade 
      looks. Then Sammy follows Ben, keeping an eye on him... 

                                  BEN (CONT D)

                    the street? Get outta here, go on! 

      Ben stares at Ferguson. He shrugs.

                    Lettin  the animals be animals... 

      He gestures to the many CITIZENS and their KIDS out gawking 
      on the street, leaning over balconies, some even eating. 

                                  BEN
                          (re: spit, kids  sticks)

                                  FERGUSON
                    Excuse me? 

                                  BEN
                    Shouldn t we secure the area? Keep 
                    it free of debris?

      He spits again and moves off. Ben goes rigid, but then a 
      DETECTIVE CAR rolls up. Sammy gives Ben a steadying look.

      John sits on his car doing paperwork. Tang in b.g. talks with

                          (grins)
                    Right. Heard the Department had 
                    lowered its standards. 

    An awkward beat, Sammy watching and feeling the chill... 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Well, I should probably write this 
                    up.  

                                  SAMMY
                    Yep, okay, we ll see you. 

    As Sammy and Ben start off -- 

                                  JOHN
                    Keep an eye on him, Bryant. Kid 
                    could still step on his meat. 

      Sammy smiles -- I m on it -- as they move off. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


    The asshole throws the girl down like a rag doll and rabbits. 
      Sammy and Ben go after him. He cuts down a NARROW PATH along 
      some public housing units and plows straight through a CHAIN-
      LINK FENCE, knowing just where to hit it. They do the same 
      but get scratched to shit. They come out in an ALLEY and see 
      him sprinting for an OPEN GARAGE at the rear of a house --  

                                  SAMMY
                    I got the front!

      Sammy hops a low fence and runs toward the front of the house 
      to cut him off. Ben pursues the guy into the garage.   


      After banging into a table toppling food and plastic lawn 
      chairs, Ben suddenly stops. He s facing 20 GANGSTERS having a 
      BBQ, as the asshole he was chasing leaps a fence and 
      disappears. MUSIC THUMPS. They ve all been drinking. CAMERA 
      FINDS a couple of gangsters  hands hovering near their hidden 
      guns, the tension unbearable, the whole pack  415-ing  Ben:      

                                  GANGSTERS
                    What the fuck, man? We ain t done 
                    shit!

                                  BEN
                          (leveling gun)
                    Get the fuck back!

      Nobody does. An O.G. steps right up to Ben -- 

                                  O.G. 
                    Fuck you doin  in my yard? Go 
                    around, muthafucka!  

      The other gangsters CHORUS and start closing in around Ben. 
      Ben has to think fast, and knows he can t seem weak --      

                                  BEN
                          (lying)

                    Yeah. Broke into his room and did 
                    it in front of his little sister. 
                    That suddenly okay in this 
                      neighborhood? 

    The gangsters are still pissed, but fuck that shit... 

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Okay? We good? You gonna let me  *
                    through so I can hook this asshole 
                    up? 

      With a nod from the O.G., the mob parts and they let Ben 
      through. Ben unlatches a back gate, and we see the look on *
    his face -- shit, that was close. Ben takes off running...     *

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Sammy chases the asshole, really flying, gaining on him. UP 
      AHEAD -- 2 COP CARS, lights and SIRENS, come fish-tailing 
      around a corner to cut him off. Desperate, the asshole runs 
      out into the street, cars HONKING, swerving. He barely avoids  
      speeding cars, even manages to scramble up over the hood and 
      roof of one while it s moving, without getting hurt, but then 
      -- he gets creamed by an ONCOMING TRUCK and thrown 20 feet. 

      Sammy catches up to him, his broken body on the ground. Still 
      alive but wrecked. As Sammy stands over him, sucking air... 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Tang and John have pulled over the Corolla, the DRIVER rock 
      still in a way that seems ominous. As usual, Tang cautiously  
      walks up to him... but then even she relaxes a bit as she 
      sees an exceedingly mellow WHITE RASTAFARIAN with heavy 
      eyelids at the wheel.  

                                  TANG
                    Sir, you been maybe doing a little 
                    partying this morning? 

                                  COROLLA DRIVER
                    Nuh-uh, nope. 

                                  TANG

                                  COROLLA DRIVER
                    Nope.

      Tang glances at John, who by now is coming up next to her... 

                                  JOHN
                    Step out of the car for us, sir. 
                          (he does, rather shakily)
                    Can you walk a straight line -- 

    The Driver falls against the Corolla, stoned out of his mind. 
      They catch him and get him to stand up on his own...   

                                  TANG
                    Alright, sir, okay. You got any 
                    tampons on you today? 

      John stifles a laugh --

                    See, reason I m asking is... 

      Tang gestures behind his ear, and now we see -- a big FAT 
      DOOBIE as thick as your index finger. Tang plucks it out.

      Ben, Ferguson, and OTHER COPS are attempting to secure the 
      scene around the asshole s broken body. An ANGRY CROWD has 
      formed. People have their phones out taking video. 

    In b.g. Sammy talks to the teary-eyed GIRL whom the asshole 
      was beating, her LIPS and NOSE BLOODY. She s wrapped in a 
      blanket and sitting in the back of a PATROL CAR. Sammy leaves 
    her with a FEMALE COP and hooks up with Ben and Ferguson.  

                                  SAMMY
                    She s 14, he s her mom s boyfriend. 
                    She stayed home sick from school 
                    while Mom went to work. He jumped 
                    her.  

                                  FERGUSON

                    She fought him off before he could 
                    rape her and ran into the street. 

                                  FERGUSON
                    Hurt his feelings, sure. Who 
                    wouldn t pound the hell out of her?  *

                    You wanna give him mouth-to-mouth, 
                    step right up.  

    Ben looks to Sammy: This guy is out of control. The other 
      cops start pushing the crowd back onto the sidewalk...    

                                  BEN
                    He s gonna bleed out before the

                    And your point is, Columbo? 

                                  BEN
                    I don t think we should let him do

                     Every life is precious.    

    Ben looks to Sammy, who doesn t give him much support. The 
      rage of the crowd increasing, getting scary -- 

                                  CROWD MEMBER (O.S) 
                    They just gonna kill him! It s

                                  BEN
                    I m getting the kit. 

      Defiant, Ben goes to the OPEN TRUNK of a PATROL CAR and 
      brings over a FIRST AID KIT. Again he meets eyes with Sammy: 
    I m really on my own here? A beat, then Sammy kneels down 
      with Ben next to the guy. They take out bandages and start 
      wrapping them around his legs, as he MOANS. 

                                  SAMMY
                          (sotto)
                    Not too tight, okay...

      Ben stares at him.

      Lydia and Ruben talk quietly with TWO NARCS, baggies of rock 
      laid out on the hood of their CROWN VIC. A DEALER and several 
      CRACKHEADS are cuffed and seated on the curb, being F/I d by 
      PATROL COPS. Denelle stands off to the side, looking like a 
      guilty child. Lydia goes to her, Ruben watching. A beat. 
      Lydia madder than we ve ever seen her.

      painted FOOD TRUCK, the LINE around the corner. Dewey and 
      some BUDDIES are already there eating off paper plates.   

                                  DEWEY

                    First time here, I d do the pork 
                    belly. Soaked all night in lemon, 
                    then stuffed with sesame seeds and 
                    cabbage.

                    you can probably budge right to the 
                    front!

                            (half-agreeing)
                    We can just jump the line. 

                                  TANG
                    Bad message to the community. 

                                  JOHN
                    They d rather wait 20 minutes while 
                    the bad guys rob their houses? 

                                  TANG
                    We wait like everybody else. 

      They start to the end of the line, as The RADIO CRACKLES -- 

                                  RADIO (O.S.)
                    A-57, employee reports a possible

                    6600 Kolmar at Pratt. Clear to 
                    handle?   

      Tang looks as if she s just been socked in the neck. 

                                  TANG
                    No. No, no. 

                                  JOHN
                    It is our area. 

                                  TANG
                    It s not a crime to kill yourself. 
                          (off John s look)
                    The truck ll be gone by the time we 
                    get back.

                    Sayonara, A-57! Adieu and bye-bye! 

      John just gives her a look: you know we gotta take this...

    She and John go back to their car, as Dewey and his buddies 
      practically lick their plates in ecstasy.

      Tang gets in and SLAMS her door.*

      Sammy, Ben, and Ferguson hook up with the PARAMEDICS as they 
      slide the guy into the AMBULANCE. The crowd is quieter now, 
      duped into believing that the cops at least did something.   

                                  SAMMY
                          (to Paramedic)
                    Any word on the victim s injuries? 

                                  PARAMEDIC #1
                    Broken nose, collar bone. Not great 
                    but she ll be okay.   

      They all share a look of relief. The Paramedic nods toward 
    the asshole and gives our cops a knowing, even amused look.   *

                                  PARAMEDIC #1 (CONT D)
                    Don t quit your day jobs. Bandages 
                    on this guy were about as tight as 
                    an old lady s nighty. *

                          (shrugs, playing along)*
                    Didn t want to move him too much, *
                    you know.  Risk of paralysis.  *

                                  PARAMEDIC #1*
                    He wakes up en route, he might just  *
                    need an emergency spinal tap. 

                                  FERGUSON
                    Yeah, with an AIDS-infected needle. 

    Ben is silent through all this, just watching, taking it in. 
    He makes a move for the ambulance, still focused on the job.  

                                  BEN
                    I gotta cuff him to the gurney. 

    But then the other PARAMEDIC leans his head out. 

                                  PARAMEDIC #2
                          (good job)
                    Keep your cuffs clean, man. He s 
                    dead. 

      Ferguson spits. Shame. And even Sammy just nods; he ll sleep 
      just fine. OFF BEN, feeling like an island, but also not 
      quite sure what he s feeling...  

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      YELLOW TAPE and barriers surround the crime scene, as WE FIND 
      Ben and Sammy leaning on a PATROL CAR surrounded by other 
      BLACK & WHITES with LIGHTS SWIRLING; NEWS VANS and REPORTERS; 
      SUITS walking around with notebooks. This is a big deal.  

      After a beat, Sammy suddenly THROWS UP, holding the side-view 
      mirror as he retches. Ben next to him still looks as if his 
      every cell is vibrating.

    Ben looks down; then notices -- ditto for him.

      Dewey comes over, equally frazzled but holding it together --

                    worst, but you know how it goes.

                    Yeah? You sure of that? 

      Sammy fixes Ben with a look, Ben silently acknowledging  
      Sammy s right -- what Ferguson did can t be denied. 

                                  DEWEY

                    No. Just some guy. *

      As they all absorb that, still reeling from the adrenaline...  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The RUMBLE of an LAPD AIRSHIP overhead, as we find Lydia and 
      Ruben walking on the beach toward the ocean. They re met by a 
      PATROL COP, who gestures toward a very large, half taped up 
       Igloo  COOLER embedded in the sand like a sunken treasure. 

                                  PATROL COP
                          (off notes)
                    Some Narcs busting a crack pad 
                     round 114th, reported a woman 
                    getting shoved into a blinged-out 
                    Escalade. This one matches her 
                      description...  

      Lydia nods, and she and Ruben walk up to the COOLER riddled 
      with BULLET HOLES. DENELLE S BODY is inside full of bullets, 
      one leg hanging out. Lydia stares. People have a choice. To 
      rise above, or drown. Lydia s own words, and she meant them. 

    But it s hard.    

      Lydia looks out at the waves and sees a lone SHOE, one of 
      Denelle s, just now making its way to shore... 

      Silence. Just the WAVES CRASHING. 

                                  LYDIA
                    Guess she finally got to see the 
                    ocean.

      Then, with a last look at Denelle, and a nod to Ruben, Lydia 
      slips off her shoes. She starts to walk off down the beach. 
    She walks barefoot in the water as the sun sets over 
      Malibu...  

                                                                            CUT TO:
