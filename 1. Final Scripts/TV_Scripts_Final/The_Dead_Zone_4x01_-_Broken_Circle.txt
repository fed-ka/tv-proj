          SEASON THREE RECAP

          Focusing on Johnny's relationship with Rebecca:  her
          initial distrust giving way to intimacy; Johnny confiding
          his Armageddon vision; her preparations to kill Stillson;
          Johnny collapsing in his house as he realizes her plan.

                                                                                FADE TO:

  11EXT. RURAL SOUTHERN CHURCH - DAY - 1978

          A battered MERCURY parked out front.  From within we hear
          the sound of an organ and a girl singing "Amazing Grace"
          with a timeless simplicity.

          Super:  "Macon, Georgia, 1978"


  22INT. CHURCH - DAY - 1978 - CONTINUOUS

          THE SMILING FACE of a perfectly groomed 12-year-old boy --
          GREG STILLSON -- FILLS THE SCREEN.  Greg's grey-blue eyes
          have a devilish twinkle in them as they connect with:


          A PRETTY 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL

          rehearsing with an organist.  She catches the young
          Stillson looking at her and turns away playfully.


          WIDER ON GREG

            Revealing JAMES STILLSON (31) mopping his brow while a
          60ish MINISTER examines a fancy white illustrated BIBLE.

                                        MINISTER
                        I'm sorry Mister Stillson, times
                        are hard.  I can't get my
                          congregation to pick up the Bibles
                        we have.

          James goes to Plan B, producing a stack of index cards.

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        We'll leave these cards in case
                        one of your parishioners --

          But Young Greg notices a small baseball field, through a
          window, outside the church; and red clay stuck to the


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - TEASER - 2/10/05 - WHITE  2.

          shoes of the Minister.

                                        YOUNG GREG
                        You a baseball fan, Minister?

          James shoots his son an angry look:  What's he up to?

                                        MINISTER
                        Well, I guess I...

                                        YOUNG GREG
                        I used to play.  Lost interest. 
                        Game got stale.  My Daddy, he
                        bought me a new mitt for Christmas
                        and I couldn't wait to get out
                        and shag some flies.

          Greg takes the white Bible out of the minister's hands.

                                        YOUNG GREG (CONT'D)
                        Bibles are like that new mitt: 
                        they'll make your congregation
                        feel excited about comin' to
                        church.

          The Minister looks at Greg appraisingly, then at James.

                                        MINISTER
                        That's quite a story.

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                          I apologize --

                                        MINISTER
                        I hope you don't mind if I make
                        it my own for this Sunday's sermon? 
                        We'll take a dozen.  You don't
                        mind singles, do you?

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                                (slightly dumbfounded)
                        Singles'll be just fine.

          As he counts out the money into James' hand, Greg beams
          at the girl; he's been showing off.  The transaction
            complete, the Minister moves away.  Dad's proud grin is
          quickly replaced by an angry scowl as he yanks young Greg
          out the door...


  33EXT. CHURCH - 1978 - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          ...and around to the side of the building.

    3CONTINUED:3

                                        30-ISH JAMES (CONT'D)
                        Pretty full'a yourself, aren't
                        ya?

                                        YOUNG GREG
                        I sold 'em, didn't I?  If it was
                        up to you we'd be sleepin' in the
                        car again.

          James SLAPS him hard across the face.

                                        YOUNG GREG (CONT'D)
                          I thought --

          Another slap, more vicious than the first.

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        Sass me again.

          Greg considers the challenge, his eyes raging at his
          father.  He can't help himself --

                                        YOUNG GREG
                        Y'owe me two dollars.

          A third slap.  Greg's mouth starts to bleed.

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        You got one hard head, boy.

          James slips on his cap and walks away, as Greg wipes the
          trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth and sees
          the girl looking at him through the window, humiliation
          now compounding his pain...

                                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                          Congressman?


  44INT. STILLSON'S D.C. HOTEL SUITE - DAY - PRESENT

          Now we're close on the face of the present-day GREG
            STILLSON, a faraway look in his eye.  JAKE TRUAX, one of
          his senior staff members sits across from him.

                                        STILLSON
                                  (refocusing)
                        New management.

                                        TRUAX
                          A senior consultant.  Best in the
                          business.  We bring him aboard,
                        he's gonna want to make changes.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - TEASER - 2/10/05 - WHITE  4.


    4CONTINUED:4

          His eyes go to current-day JAMES STILLSON, who's across
          the room, finishing a phone call.  Greg looks conflicted.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'll think about it.

          Oblivious, his father hangs up and approaches with a grin.

                                        JAMES
                        Ready for some good news?

                                        STILLSON
                        Always.

                                        JAMES
                        Looks like your "pal" Johnny Smith
                        is about to have brain surgery. 
                        Maybe we'll be rid of that psycho
                        once and for all.

                                        STILLSON
                          "Psych-ic," not "psych-o."

          James doesn't like to be corrected in public.

                                        STILLSON
                                (to Truax)
                        We make that call to Justice?

                                        TRUAX
                        Johnny Smith gets out of the
                          hospital, he's gonna find himself
                        up to his neck in Federal Agents.

                                        STILLSON
                        If he gets out.

          And off Stillson, that same devilish twinkle in his eyes...

                                                                          TIME CUT TO:

          (NOTE: Existing scenes from the original "Tipping Point
          Part 2" will hereafter be indicated by bold text.)

          CLOSE ON JOHNNY as his eyes open.  He's in a hospital
          bed, his head heavily bandaged.  He tries to sit up but
          has difficulty moving.  Disoriented and scared, he sees --

          BRUCE AND A NURSE

          enter.  The nurse checks Johnny's vital signs.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey.  How are you doing?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        What happened?  

                                        BRUCE
                        You don't even remember, do you?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                                        BRUCE
                        Excuse us.

          Bruce gestures to the nurse, who leaves.

                                        BRUCE
                        You must have blacked out after a
                        vision.  When I found you I thought
                        you were having another seizure,
                        so I took you to the E.R.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What... happened?  

                                        BRUCE
                        The doctors said you might slip
                        back into a coma.  Sarah consented
                        to the surgery.  That was two
                        days ago.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (piecing it together)
                        ...the operation... my visions?  

                                        BRUCE
                        We don't know.  It was an eleven
                        hour operation.  They said the
                        risk was too high.  Like you were
                          carrying a time bomb in your head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Give me my cane.

                        Maybe we should check with the
                        doctor.

          Bruce opens the patient cubby next to the bed and extracts
          Johnny's cane.  He hands it to Johnny, who grips it.  No
          WHOOSH.  No visions.  Nothing.

          Walt and Sarah ENTER.

          Johnny reaches out and touches Walt, then Sarah.

                        My visions.  They're gone...

                        Oh, Johnny.  Is it really possible?

                        You did the right thing.

                        Where's Rebecca?  

          Bruce, Sarah and Walt exchange glances.  No one wants to
          field this one.

                                        SARAH
                          Johnny... she... we're so sorry.

                        Rebecca died, Johnny.

                        How?

          A man in a suit, who we will learn is a Federal Marshal
          named PENDRAGON, approaches the RECEPTIONIST.

                                        PENDRAGON
                        Excuse me.  You have a patient
                        named John Smith.  What room is

                        I'm sorry, we can't give out any
                          information --

          But Pendragon just takes a clipboard off the counter,

          Walt, seated in a waiting area, sees the commotion and

                        I'm here to arrest John Smith.

          He hands Walt a warrant, which Walt glances at --

                          Kidnapping?  Are you kidding?

                        The kidnapping charge federalizes
                        the murder of Rachel Caldwell.

                        Hang on a second.  He's about to
                        undergo brain surgery.

                        And I'm about to station an officer

          Johnny, in the passenger seat, is just waking up.  When
          the car hits a bump he straightens himself up in the seat. 
          He's a bit freaked out --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where are we?

                        Like a man who needs brain surgery.

                                        BRUCE
                        You know how dangerous this is,
                        right?  For all you know, you're
                        next vision could be your last.

                        What choice do I have?

                        You had a vision that Stillson
                        was going to be killed by Rebecca --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes -- and in the same vision you
                        told me that she was killed doing
                        it.

          Bruce soaks that in.

                        Even you, in the future, believe
                        this needs to happen.  Are you
                        sure we're doing the right thing?
                        I can't believe I'm saying this,

          Johnny pulls out his cell phone, starts to dial.

                        You know it's heartbreaking what
                          happened to Rachel.  I'm so glad
                        you decided to reconsider my offer.

          They react as James Stillson enters.  Greg would have
            preferred Dad stay out of this. 

                                        STILLSON
                          "Rachel's Law" will be a fitting
                        tribute to your sister.  And it
                        will keep her case front and center
                        over at the Justice Department.

                        I lost faith in Johnny Smith.
                        One lie too many I suppose.  All
                        I want now is for her attacker to
                        be brought to justice.

                        Especially if it's him.  He used
                        her death to get close to me.

                                        STILLSON
                        It's hard to see something like
                        that when you're grieving.  You're
                        doing the right thing.  Having
                        you associated with the bill helps
                        people see that it's not an
                          abstraction, that crime affects
                        all of us.  There's a dinner
                          tomorrow night, I've been asked
                        to speak about the bill.
                        You want to be there when I
                          announce that it's called "Rachel's
                        Law?"

          Dad flashes Greg a look of disapproval.

                                        REBECCA
                        Yes, I'd like that.

                                        STILLSON
                        Great.  My assistant will make
                        all the arrangements.  I'll see
                        you tomorrow.

          Rebecca exits.  After the door closes, James crosses to
            Stillson.

                        Don't make the same mistake you
                        made with her sister.

                        And what mistake was that?  I'm
                        not a monk.  Besides, being
                        associated with her helps with my

          bunk, reading a book and looking altogether peaceful.

          Walt lays the bundle of letters on the bunk.  Purdy looks

          Sitting beside him at the dressing table, as she finishes
          loading her revolver, then puts it in her purse and shuts
          the dresser drawer.  Johnny instinctively reaches out to
          her, but as he does, the vision fades.

          He opens the same drawer and finds a PRESS RELEASE for
          the news conference.  It's scheduled for a downtown

                        Almost sounds like the
                          Congressman's got his own op going
                        on.


  2525INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

          As Johnny and Bruce exit, closing the door, Johnny shows
          Bruce the press release.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's where she's going to do
                        it.  At this press conference
                        this afternoon.

                                        BRUCE
                        Three o'clock.  At least we've
                        got time.

          Johnny nods, not that that's much comfort.  Bruce hits
          the elevator button.  There's a window next to the
            elevator.  Suddenly...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Federal agents... on their way
                        up.

                                        BRUCE
                        You have another vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, but not the psychic kind.

          He nods out the window as Bruce looks --


  2626POV - FEDERAL AGENTS - EXT. APARTMENT BLDG. - DAY

          TWO AGENTS make their way across the street to the
            apartment building.          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - ACT ONE - 2/25/05 - WHT-2  19A.

                        Stairs!


  2828EXT. APARTMENT BLDG. - SERVICE ALLEY - DAY

          Bruce and Johnny exit the building, approach the street
          ... only to see THREE MORE AGENTS covering the street. 
          There's no getting past them.  Once again, Bruce thinks
          quickly, then turns to Johnny and puts a restraining hand
          on his chest.

                        They're not looking for me.  Yet.

          Hands in his pockets, he heads toward his SUV, which is
          parked up the street.  Johnny watches him go, puzzled.


  2929ANGLE - ON THE TRIO OF AGENTS

          As they react to the sound of a loud off-screen CRASH. 
          They turn to see Bruce's SUV backing up after having
          apparently rammed the car in front.  Clearly, someone's
          in a hurry to leave.  They draw their guns...


          JOHNNY

          Watches the agents run past, then ducks out of the alley
          and heads the opposite way down the sidewalk, pulling up
          his collar.


          THE AGENTS

          Surround the car.  Agent 1 aims his gun at the TINTED
          driver's side window.

                                        AGENT 1
                        Turn off the ignition and get out
                        of the car!

          The window rolls down and Bruce looks out innocently.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, man.  It's not my fault.  He
                        boxed me in.

          Agent 1 peers into the car, realizing he's been duped. 
          Then he looks down the street in the direction Johnny
          went, but Johnny can no longer be seen among the various
            pedestrians.  Off the agent's frustration...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  3030EXT. CHEAP MOTEL - DAY - 1987

          Super:  "Long Branch, New Jersey, 1987"

          21-YEAR-OLD GREG STILLSON sings along to an upbeat pop
          hit (in a perfect world:  Sting's "Every Breath You Take")
          as he parks his used Honda.  He hops out excitedly, lugging
          his bulky sample case, but his high spirits take a dive
          when he sees a familiar battered Mercury parked nearby.


  3131INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY - 1987 - MOMENTS LATER

          Greg is frantically tearing open dresser drawers and
          closets as James Stillson, now 36, reclines on the bed,
          hands behind his head, cowboy boots bobbing to the beat
          of a COUNTRY SONG playing on Greg's boombox, a SILVER HIP
          FLASK on a night table beside him.

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        Three months on the road and I
                        don't rate a hi-how-are-ya, Pop?

                                        21-YR-OLD GREG
                        Where's her stuff? 

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        She fit the whole caboodle in one
                          suitcase.  One of those new
                        Samsonites with wheels.  We might
                          consider a pair ourselves, make
                        it easier to lug around all this
                        crap.

          He tosses the flustered Greg a white Bible.

                                        21-YR-OLD GREG
                        She wouldn't walk out on me.

          James wiggles his boots --

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        Come to think of it, she's wasn't
                        walkin'... she was runnin'.
                                (beat, sits up)
                        You left her in quite a sticky
                        situation.  A baby?  Lucky old
                        Dad was around to clean up your
                        mess.

                                        21-YR-OLD GREG
                        What did you do?

    31CONTINUED:31

          James swings his legs over the bed, stands.

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        All you need is money and the
                        right address.

                                        21-YR-OLD GREG
                        You bastard!

          Greg runs at him, shoving him against the wall.  James
          spins Greg around, jamming him against the wall, his
          forearm crushing the boy's windpipe.  Greg rasps --

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        Listen to me, boy.  You might not
                        be the brightest bulb in the box,
                        but you were meant for somethin'
                        better than this.  I feel it, and
                        I'm bettin' you feel it, too.

          Despite Greg's anger, his father's words resonate.  He
          sags against the wall, weeping.

                                        21-YR-OLD GREG
                        I loved her.

          He smooths Greg's tie, plucks a loose thread.

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        She was a loose end, son.  We
                        can't have any loose ends.


  3232EXT. CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE BUILDING - DAY - PRESENT

          Greg and Truax head toward a waiting LIMO, James Stillson
          and Sonny Elliman following behind them.  Greg eyes his
          father, who's on his cell phone.  To Truax:

                                        STILLSON
                        The guy you were talking about. 
                        Call him.  Tell him we got a deal.

                                        TRUAX
                        It's the smart move, Greg.  You
                        won't regret it.

          James hangs up and approaches Greg as Truax opens the
          limo door.

                                        JAMES
                        What's that all about?




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - ACT TWO - 2/21/05 - YELLOW  23.

                                        STILLSON
                        Just tyin' up some loose ends.

          James stops him with a hand on his chest, then starts
            straightening his tie -- a familiar controlling gesture. 
          Greg smiles tightly, then moves toward the limo.  Elliman
          speaks to James.

                                        ELLIMAN
                          Pendragon has Smith's friend in
                        custody and he's telling them we
                        were in the apartment ... I need
                        to pull the taps out of her
                          apartment before the feds get in
                          there...

          James nods, and Elliman heads toward a nearby SEDAN while
          James follows Greg to the limo.


  3333INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Parked across the street, Walt watches the men get in
          their respective cars.  A beat as he considers which car
          to follow... then his P.O.V. zooms in on Sonny Elliman,
          and he decides to follow an investigative hunch.  As he
          pulls out after the sedan...

                                                                            WHIP-PAN TO:

          conference.  At the bottom of the steps, a crew is placing
            crowd-control barriers in place.  Other workers wheel a
          large podium into place.

          We pull back to reveal --


          JOHNNY SMITH

          watching from a distance.  He's early, no sign of Rebecca. 
          He begins to walk away, when --


            PENDRAGON

          Coming down the steps, sees him, and immediately gives
          chase.

                                        PENDRAGON

          Johnny runs a few yard, realizes he can't outrun Pendragon,
          and makes his way toward a CAB idling a the curb.


  3636INT. CAB - JOHNNY (EXISTING FOOTAGE)(FORMERLY SCENE
          162QA)

          Yanks the cabby out of the driver's seat, hops in and
          roars away.


    3737PENDRAGON (EXISTING FOOTAGE)(FORMERLY SCENE 162QB)

          runs out to where the angry Cabby still stands.  He barks
          into his lapel mic.

                        Smith just stole a cab, he's headed
                        west.

            A government sedan screeches up and Pendragon jumps in.


  3838EXT. CITY STREETS & BRIDGE (EXISTING FOOTAGE)(FORMERLY
          SCENE 162Z)

          Car chase, as filmed and edited.  Johnny drives wildly,
          trying to elude his pursuers, but is ultimately boxed in
          on a bridge by several government sedans.  He gets out of
          the cab, as Pendragon and the agents do likewise, guns
          drawn.  Johnny backs to the railing --

                                        PENDRAGON
                        Smith! It's over.  Put your hands
                        where I can see them.

          Johnny looks over the railing, sees:


          THE WATER

          far below.  A death jump.


          JOHNNY

          touches the railing, we hear the WHOOSH of a vision. The
          tension drains from his body -- apparently the vision
          wasn't good.  Johnny raises his hands, the fight gone out
          of him as he turns back to Pendragon.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - ACT TWO - 2/10/05 - WHITE  25.

            PENDRAGON

          his gun zeroed in on Johnny as he stops, about ten feet
          away.

                                        PENDRAGON
                        Don't move, Smith.  I don't want
                        to shoot you.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (calmly)
                        You won't have to.

            Pendragon starts to take the last few steps to Johnny
          when suddenly...


          JOHNNY

          cane in hand, scrambles over the railing and JUMPS.


          OVER THE BRIDGE

          Johnny, dropping his cane, tumbles down toward the water.

          (Note:  To suggest that Johnny holds onto his cane, we
          can film a new close-up of him poised on the rail with
          his cane, then try to digitally add the falling cane to
          the jump.  Or, as Michael Piller suggests, we can swallow
          the continuity error and let our diehard fans have fun
            endlessly debating it.)


            PENDRAGON

          watches Johnny go down.


          IN THE WATER

          Johnny hits, causing a huge splash.  Then, the currents
          seem to consume him.  Stay on this view a beat too long
          for comfort; he never surfaces.


          ON THE BRIDGE

            Pendragon stows his weapon as the other agents arrive.


          ON THE WATER

          Have set up on a GRASSY KNOLL (or low platform or some
          other raised vantage) across from the distinctive old
            building, with its long, wide stairs leading up to its
          main entrance. 

          (NOTE: In general, we'll try to maximize existing footage --
          mostly the wide and establishing shots -- of the courthouse
          steps action, while filming new close-ups and two-shots
          as needed.)

          AN ENORMOUS AMERICAN FLAG hangs on the building; in front
          of that are a podium and lectern and a dozen seats for
          V.I.P.s, each labeled with a logo for "RACHEL'S LAW."  On
          the steps below the podium, fifty to a hundred citizens
          have gathered.  Many wear "Rachel's Law" buttons.

          THE STEPS themselves are cordoned off with crowd-control
            barriers.  Guards are searching eager citizens waiting to
          join the patriotic crowd above.

          DAY

          HOMELESS PEOPLE grouped around a burning trash can...
          Finding Johnny, his hair still wet, slipping on a dry old
          tattered overcoat to go with the tattered pants and
          sweatshirt as a homeless man counts a sheaf of twenties. 
          Johnny has his cane.  (We might hear a brass band not far
          away begin to play, Johnny's head turns to the sound and
          realizes the ceremony is about to begin.)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - ACT TWO - 2/18/05 - PINK  27.


  4444EXT. COURTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Two guards pull aside a crowd control barrier to let Greg
          and Rebecca through, bypassing the security check.

          Rebecca wants to speak to Greg alone, but he's pulled
          along and she follows him up the steps, someone always
          between them.  Off the tension in her face... her hands
          gripping her purse...


  4545EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny, now dressed in the tattered overcoat and hooded
          sweatshirt, approaches the crowd that's now fenced in by
          security barriers.  He sees Rebecca standing near Stillson
          on the steps as he waves to the crowd.  Johnny tries to
          move toward them but a cop, treating him like the homeless
          man he looks like, just waves him back.

                                        COP
                        Move along, you.

          Johnny moves away from the cop, keeping his eyes on
          Rebecca, pulls out his cellphone, it's still damp, he
          shakes it to see if it's working... he tries to dial...

            Pendragon comes out of the courthouse, scans the area.


  4747ON THE STEPS

          Stillson waves to the cheering crowd.  Rebecca nervously
          opens her purse and reaches inside for her gun...

            Rebecca's fingers close on the grip of the GUN -- just as
          the cell phone nestled beside it RINGS again.  A beat,
          then she lets go of the gun and takes out the phone...
          sees Johnny's name once again on the screen.

          CLOSE ON REBECCA as she senses this could be the last
          time she hears Johnny's voice.  A beat, then she answers,
          still determined to go through with her plan.

                          I always liked that jacket.  The
                        color suits you.

          Caught off-guard, Rebecca looks up, her eyes scanning the
          crowd until some instinct helps her zoom in on Johnny
          standing apart from the news teams atop the grassy knoll.

          As he stares at Rebecca, holding her distant look as he
            maintains this charged electronic connection.

                        I know what you're doing.  I also
                        know it's going to get you killed.

                        Your life matters.  To me, if not
                        to you.

          Rebecca glances at Stillson, waving to the crowd.

          in a slightly rumpled suit on the other side of the bars. 
          Though his appearance is nondescript, he has an easy

          He puts his hands through the bars, palms up... and Purdy

          Sonny eyes him for a beat, then picks up his briefcase.

                        I've got a feeling the only
                          evidence you have is the psychic
                          variety.  You know, not admissible

          We see Walt's eyes flare.  Sonny turns to exit, but
          suddenly Walt's hand is on his shoulder.  Elliman just

          Johnny comes out of the vision with a start.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How much further?

                        Almost there.


  7575INT. STILLSON'S HOTEL SUITE - EVENING

          Stillson sits on a couch with Rebecca, watching as she
          sips from a glass of scotch.  She glances at her purse on
          a counter.  She's still trying to work up her nerve.

                                        STILLSON
                        Feel better?
                                (when she nods)
                        That's a Glenfiddich single malt. 
                        I don't break it out for just
                        anyone.  But you're special...
                        like your sister.

          He leans forward... touches her cheek.

                                        STILLSON
                        Did Rachel tell you we were...
                        close?  You're even more beautiful
                        than she was.

          He starts to kiss her.  He's not just being smarmy; he
          feels a genuine attraction to her, and believes it's being
            reciprocated.  But Rebecca's a little flustered.

          Stillson gets the idea, nods to the bathroom...  Rebecca
          gets up, camera moving with her as she grabs her purse
          off the counter --

                                        STILLSON
                        Don't take too long.

          She looks back at him then exits into the bathroom, closing
          the door behind her.

          She shuts the door, then opens her purse, takes out the
            revolver, checks the load again, then eyes herself in the
          mirror.  This is it.  She collects herself, then puts the
          gun back in the purse, leaving it unzipped.


  7777INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - EVENING

          The post-rally reception has broken up, workers cleaning
          up the refuse.  Near the reception desk, not far from an
            elevator, James Stillson chews out a BODYGUARD.

                                        JAMES
                        I don't care what the Congressman
                        said, I want you outside his door.

          They're both distracted by a ruckus outside the hotel's
          front door.  We see WALT arguing with the DOORMAN,
            demanding to see Congressman Stillson.

                                        JAMES
                        Bannerman.  Get rid of him, then
                        get back upstairs.

          James watches him go, meanwhile taking out a silver HIP
          FLASK and unscrewing the top.


          NEW ANGLE

          from behind as Johnny uses the distraction Walt has created
          to sneak toward --


  7878INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS - WITH VISIONS

          The doors close.  Johnny doesn't know what floor Stillson's
          on, so he lightly touches a couple of buttons, getting
          WHOOSHES for visions we don't see.

    78CONTINUED:78

          Then Johnny's fingers are drawn to the button for Floor
          12.  He lightly touches it...

          Bingo.  The doors open, and Stillson guides Rebecca out,
          nodding to a door across the hall.  Room 714.

                                        STILLSON
                        Ladies first.

          He turns to a BODYGUARD who starts to follow them out.

                                        STILLSON
                        Don't think I'll be needing your
                        help, if you get my drift.

          The Bodyguard nods, backs into the elevator as the doors
          close, ending the vision.

          Johnny's alone again.  He's about to push the button when
          suddenly the doors open again, revealing James Stillson
          in the lobby.  This time, it isn't a vision.

                                        JAMES
                        Smith!

          He reaches inside and grabs Johnny by the arm, triggering --


7979A VISION:  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (EXISTING FOOTAGE)(FORMERLY
          SCENE 138)

          Johnny sees Rachel Caldwell run for her life.  At one
          point she stumbles and drops the video camera.  As she
          lies helpless on the ground...


          THE KILLER

          towers over her.  Rachel crawls backwards away from the
          man, pleading for her life; we're behind her assailant,
          his identity still obscured.

                                        RACHEL
                        Please, no, why are you doing
                        this?  I didn't tell him anything --

          He picks up the camera, swings at her, knocking her back. 
          She seems almost stunned that it has happened; she reaches
          up and touches the blood on her forehead.

          Tears are in her eyes.  Another BLOW and she goes down.
          The killer turns to look around, revealing himself to be --

          He's upset, panting, a little crazed.  He pulls the silver

          Shocked even as he shoves James backwards out of the
            elevator.  A beat as the two men face each other.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was you.  You killed Rachel.

          Surprise keeps James rooted in place as the elevator door
          closes between them.  He pounds the button but it's gone.


  8181INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny absorbs the vision, trying to understand how he
          could have been so wrong.  As the elevator lights climb
          toward 12 --


    8282INTERCUT: INT. STILLSON'S SUITE - NIGHT

          On the couch, Rebecca leans down to kiss Stillson...
          pushing him down on his back.  But as he looks into her
          eyes, he sees no warmth there.  Something about this is
          wrong, and his natural suspicion kicks in.

                                        STILLSON
                        This is nice.  Real nice.  But I
                        gotta wonder.  Why are you here?

                                        REBECCA
                        What do you mean?

          As meanwhile camera follows her hand as it drifts down
          toward her purse on the floor.

          Stillson doesn't notice, but he grips her other wrist,
          his voice cool, deliberate.

                                        STILLSON
                        I mean, why are you really here?

          In that moment, Rebecca's eyes flare, showing her true
            feelings.  Her anger.  Her hatred.  And now we see her
          fingers close around the grip of her gun...

          Suddenly Johnny CRASHES through the door.

                                        REBECCA

                        Your father kidnapped Rachel,
                        then beat her to death.  I saw it
                        when I touched him.

          Only here, in this moment, is Johnny certain of Stillson's
          ignorance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You really didn't know, did you?

                        Get out, before I have you both
                          arrested.

          Rebecca, stunned, is finally led out by Johnny.

          As Johnny pulls Rebecca inside, pulls out a red emergency
          stop button, then hits "Lobby."  Through the closing doors
          we glimpse James Stillson and the Bodyguard heading down
          the hall from another elevator.  Then the doors close and
          Johnny sags slightly against the wall.

                                        REBECCA
                        John.  I'm sorry... I just...

                          anymore.

          He pulls her close as she begins to cry, her desire for
          revenge finally giving way to simple grief.

          Johnny's own eyes close; this ordeal finally over.  Or at
          least it is for him...

                        between you and Rachel Caldwell?

          Greg just eyes him coldly as he sips his drink.  Finally,
          his father relents with an "aww, what the heck" shrug.

                                        JAMES
                        That bitch was trouble.  She should

                        Don't talk about her.

          James shakes off the blow realizing he's just hit a very
          deep emotional nerve.

                                        JAMES
                        I ever tell ya 'bout how we met? 
                        She was drunk...

          Another powerful SLAP backs James a step.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm warnin' you.

                                        JAMES
                        She was sellin' herself to anybody
                        with a five dollar bill...

          Greg starts to slap him a third time, but James catches
          him by the wrist.  They hold each other's hard stare...

                                        JAMES (CONT'D)
                          I wasn't sure if I was even your
                        daddy until the blood test came
                        back.  Then I was stuck with ya.

          Greg considers his father's words, then in a fit of rage
          he lunges forward, pressing his forearm against his
          father's throat and pinning him against the wall.

                                        STILLSON
                        Shut up!  Shut your dirty mouth!

          Greg puts his weight behind his forearm as his father
            chokes...

                                        STILLSON (CONT'D)
                        All these years I've let you treat
                        me like an animal!  Like a goddamn
                        pet!

          Greg's face is inches from his father's, his internal
          rage fueling this brutal attack.

                                        JAMES
                        Greg... son...

                                        STILLSON
                        Don't call me that!  Don't ever
                        call me that again!

          After a few BEATS, James' face is red and he is no longer
          struggling, his eyes open, but any sign of life has been
          choked out of him.  A change comes over Greg's expression
          as he realizes what he's done and eases up on his grip.

                                        STILLSON (CONT'D)
                        Dad?

          James' lifeless body slides down the wall, Greg holding
          onto his shirt as it drops in a contorted heap on the
          floor.

                                        STILLSON (CONT'D)
                                (in a desperate whisper)
                        Sweet Jesus.  What have I done?

          He steps back and slumps down on the edge of the bed.

                                        STILLSON (CONT'D)
                        What have I done?          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - ACT FOUR - 2/21/05 - YELLOW  48.


  8787INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR/HALLWAY - NIGHT - TIME CUT

          POV on elevator floor numbers lighting up in succession
          as they climb again toward 12.  Then the doors open, and
          our POV approaches the door to Greg's suite, which the
            Bodyguard opens for us.


  8888INT. STILLSON'S SUITE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS POV

          Several men are inside, including Stillson's top advisor,
          Jake Truax, who now turns and greets us at the door with
            a worried look.  Behind him, Greg sits on the bed exactly
          where we left him.

                                        TRUAX
                        He won't talk to anyone... won't
                        let us move the body.

          The other men step aside as Truax leads us to where
          Stillson sits on the bed.  Truax leans down to mutter in
          his ear...

                                        TRUAX (CONT'D)
                        Greg, this is the man I told you
                        about.

          Truax leaves us, and we step closer to Stillson...


          NEW ANGLE - CU ON GREG STILLSON

          his face tear-streaked, as a man's HAND enters frame -- a
          hand bearing a now FAMILIAR RING -- and grips his shoulder.

                                        JANUS (O.S.)
                        Stand up, Congressman.

          And as Greg looks up, we reveal Purdy's mysterious visitor,
          who nods encouragingly.  Greg stands, his wracked eyes
            searching for a reason for hope and absolution.

                                        STILLSON
                        I don't know how...

                        had been drinking, he came to

                        the light switch, stumbled and
                        struck his throat on the corner
                        of the dresser.

    88CONTINUED:88

          Greg, still dazed, looks at Janus, then around the room
          as he tries to reconstruct this mythical accident.

                                        STILLSON
                          I killed him...

                                        STILLSON
                          I didn't mean...

          To everyone's surprise, Janus slaps him.  It catches
          Stillson by surprise, but it seems to help shake some of
          the cobwebs.  Janus is cold and calculated.

                                        JANUS

                        Say it.

          Greg hesitates, taking a moment to gaze at the faces of
          the men standing around him.  Except for Truax, he doesn't
            recognize anyone.  He realizes that this is truly a turning
          point in his life.  His chance to do the right thing and
          suffer the consequences, or the wrong thing and continue
          this dark journey towards an unspeakable, unimaginable
            conclusion... a BEAT, then...

                                        STILLSON
                        There was an accident.  My father
                        had been drinking...

          Janus reaches out and gently fixes Greg's rumpled shirt.

                                        JANUS
                                (calmer)
                        You've suffered a tremendous loss
                          tonight, and tomorrow the
                        newspapers will tell the story of
                        your father's tragic, but
                        accidental death.

                        stands in the way of your destiny. 
                          Nothing.

          Janus straightens Greg's collar in a creepily familiar
          fatherly gesture...

                        Take Mister Stillson's body back
                        to his suite so we can button
                        this up and notify the proper
                          authorities.  I'll need a few
                        moments alone with the Congressman.

          Truax nods, as several men prepare to move the dead body
          of James Stillson.  Greg watches, his eyes growing cold
          and detached as Janus leans in and begins speaking to
          him...

          SHOT PULLS WIDE on the room, as...

                        shone down on him... a light
                          brighter than the sun... and the
                        voice of our Lord spoke to him. 
                        "Rise and stand upon thy feet:

          Pulling back to find Johnny watching the Potomac flow by. 
          His face seems peaceful, if tinged with resignation. 
          Rebecca stands beside him.

          Johnny looks up at her.  She's as beautiful as she's ever
          been, but he can sense she's already flowing away from
          him, like the river.

          She stops, realizing who she's talking to and knowing her
          words can't fool him.  She kisses him gently on the lips.

          She walks away, as Johnny turns to look at his cane, 
          leaning against the railing.  He picks it up by the
          shaft... is about to grip the top with his other hand...
          when the memory of a voice echoes in his mind.

                        You want the answers to those big

          Johnny does indeed.  But, so far, his connection to the
          future, and his future self, has brought him nothing but
          pain and betrayal.

          THE CANE

          As it arcs high, tumbling end over end as the silver top
          catches the sun, before landing in the river.

          JOHNNY

          He watches until the current carries it under the bridge.

          Only then does he look up and acknowledge his friends --
          Walt and Bruce -- waiting across the bridge near Bruce's
          car.  Bruce steps forward as Johnny approaches.

                                        BRUCE
                        You all right?

          Johnny nods, looks back toward the river.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't need it anymore.
                                (beat)
                        C'mon.  Let's go home.

          Bruce puts as hand on his shoulder.  As they walk toward
          the car, and an unknown future...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
