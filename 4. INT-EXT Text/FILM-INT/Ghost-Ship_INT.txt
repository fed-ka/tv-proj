Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps
down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern,
oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel
and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.
Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light
on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She
kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking
in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.
The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar
and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master,
pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and
most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that
every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to
bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.
GREER (V.O. RADIO)
Greer to Murphy.
MURPHY
(lifting the radio)
Go.
Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up
at him from the stern.
GREER
The number nine on the starboard
side's half flooded. Epps says it's
a slow leak just under the waterline,
about twenty gallons an hour. They
must've pumped it before we left
Sitka.
MURPHY
Of course they did.
GREER
Let the buyer beware.
MURPHY
What do you say, Dodge?
DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
(taking the radio)
If it started out at twenty an hour
the piece of shit'd be at the bottom
of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll
make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.
Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the
turbines.
In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts
a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the
book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.
MURPHY
You're kidding, right?
VASILI
You want fair pay, make hamburger
for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to
sign.
Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.
A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in
the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the
pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a
tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads
a paper near-by.
Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer
and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's
name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack
of hundreds.
DODGE
Much obliged, skipper.
The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her
way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth.
She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope
of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a
young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they
laugh.
AT A TABLE
Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them,
Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who
is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.
GREER
Looks like Epps' gonna get some
tonight.
DODGE
With that coxswain dickhead.
MURPHY
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
DODGE
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?
Gimme a break.
Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.
DODGE
What a laugh.
A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
I'll show you, bitch!
They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late
20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.
GIRLFRIEND
You want to mess with me, I'll kick
your bitch ass, girl.
WITH EPPS
Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered
around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.
EPPS
I don't know what you're talking
about. I just bought this guy a beer.
GIRLFRIEND
This "guy" is my man, honey.
COASTGUARDSMAN
Darlene --
GIRLFRIEND
You, shut up.
EPPS
(starting off)
Listen, I don't want any trouble,
okay -- ?
GIRLFRIEND
(stopping Epps)
Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right
now.
MURPHY
(stepping up)
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
RIVETER
Whyn't you mind your own business,
chief.
Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a
beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back
to Epps and the Girlfriend.
MURPHY
As I said, what seems to be the
trouble?
RIVETER
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you
got your hearing aid turned down?
MURPHY
I heard you. But I'm choosing to
ignore you. Epps, let's go.
Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking
Murphy by the collar.
RIVETER
These ladies was having themselves a
discussion and you're interrupting
it.
MURPHY
You got about two seconds to get
your paws off me, Tarzan.
RIVETER
Or what?
Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks
in two over the Riveter's head.
Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half
he still holds, shaking his head.
The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs
buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds
some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.
MURPHY
Epps?
He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She
grabs her coat.
COASTGUARDSMAN
Wait.
Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his
girlfriend.
COASTGUARDSMAN
Darlene. It's over.
He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes
as the others look on.
COASTGUARDSMAN
I don't love you anymore.
Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her
on the back.
COASTGUARDSMAN
(to Epps)
Come on, Candy. Let's get out of
here.
The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy
and the others as he leads her out.
Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from
the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.
GREER
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
MURPHY
Red sky in morning, sailor take
warning.
Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.
DODGE
Fuck it.
He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her
cigarette, collecting her winnings.
EPPS
One more?
DODGE
Why not.
She gathers the cards, shuffles.
DODGE
What is your first name?
EPPS
What?
DODGE
It just occurred to me I don't know
your first name. All this time and I
don't know it.
She deals the cards in silence.
EPPS
(finally)
Maureen.
DODGE
What?
EPPS
Maureen.
DODGE
Maureen?
She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.
EPPS
What's yours?
Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.
DODGE
Roger.
EPPS
Roger?
DODGE
Yeah.
She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.
DODGE
You think that's funny
EPPS
(lying)
No.
She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.
The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked
as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks
the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and
picks up a walkie-talkie.
GREER
(into walkie)
Greer to Murphy.
Greer studies the radar display as he waits.
MURPHY (V.O. RADIO)
Yeah.
GREER
There's a large vessel out about ten
miles to the north-west.
Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his
radio.
GREER
I been watching it for close to an
hour and it hasn't moved. I can't
raise it on the radio either. Makes
me think it might be in trouble.
MURPHY
Alright. I'll be right up.
CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the sweep-refresh reveals a bright
point of light in the middle of nowhere.
MURPHY (O.S.)
Merchant vessel at position one seven
four one five west, five seven seven
five north.
Murphy holds the radio mic as Greer looks on, Epps and Dodge
standing back.
MURPHY
This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey
alpha sierra bravo four zero niner
two. Over.
Only the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio
speaker as the bright point flashes on the radar screen.
MURPHY
(to radio)
Merchant vessel at one seven four
one five west, five seven seven five
north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior
whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero
niner two. Over.
Again, only white noise comes back as the point flashes on
the screen.
MURPHY
Too deep to anchor out there.
GREER
Looks like it's adrift.
EPPS
Could be a fishing boat.
GREER
Too big. More like a freighter.
MURPHY
What the hell would a freighter be
doing up here? It's way out of the
lanes. There's not a port for 800
miles.
DODGE
Smugglers maybe.
GREER
Smuggling what? Tundra grass?
A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.
MURPHY
Merchant vessel at position one seven
four one five west, five seven seven
five north, this is tugboat Arctic
Warrior. Do you copy? Over.
Again, only the quiet hiss of static comes back.
GREER
Call the Coastguard?
MURPHY
Steer to one eight five. Let's check
her out.
CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer.
Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching.
MURPHY
Alright. Back it off.
Greer throttles back and the boat slows.
MURPHY
Hit the lights.
The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the
light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad
beam of light with a joy stick.
They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves,
when a shadow looms into view.
MURPHY
Whoa, whoa.
Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow
looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.
As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting
bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness
above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of
what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come
around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor
alleys.
MURPHY
"Chimera."
Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.
MURPHY
Chimera.
Murphy raises the mic again.
MURPHY
Chimera, I am hove to at your port
bow. Is there anyone aboard?
They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the
glare of their lights.
MURPHY
Epps, come with me. You guys sit
tight.
Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen
making their way up under the floodlights.
Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in
here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.
Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.
GREER
(into radio)
Talk to me, skipper.
After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.
MURPHY
We're in a stairwell just under the
main superstructure.
Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.
MURPHY
This is definitely an old boat, maybe
sixty years old. She hasn't been in
service for at least twenty years.
Probably a lot longer.
They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which
takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them,
revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen
equipment, a few pots still hanging.
They move through the galley and into another, narrower,
passageway.
Greer and Dodge look on.
MURPHY
It's funny.
GREER
How's that?
MURPHY
Besides a little rust, everything's
pretty well-preserved.
Greer and Dodge look at each other.
MURPHY
How she got out here is one hell of
a good question.
(a long beat, then)
Jesus.
Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting. Only silence from the
other end.
GREER
What is it?
No answer.
GREER
Murphy.
No answer.
GREER
Murphy, goddamit.
MURPHY
(finally)
Sorry.
Another beat in silence.
GREER
What is it?
Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over
an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.
MURPHY
It's a passenger ship. It's a damn
passenger ship.
Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate
opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor
and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier
hanging over it all.
Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.
DODGE
Probably slipped her moorings, got
tangled up in a current.
EPPS
Out here? What, so a seven hundred
foot passenger liner drifted out of
Spokane harbor and nobody managed to
bump into her until now?
DODGE
Somebody's probably looking for her
as we speak.
MURPHY
Whatever the reason, she's adrift
and abandoned. We've got every right
to salvage her.
GREER
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty
thousand ton ship you're talking
about.
MURPHY
We've done it before.
DODGE
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to
the other. But we got half the Bering
Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to
drag her over.
MURPHY
You have any idea how much a ship
like that could be worth in salvage?
The fittings alone could go for a
few million.
DODGE
If you get it back in one piece.
MURPHY
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
GREER
All we got to do is hit some rough
weather and you can forget about it.
MURPHY
So we cut her loose and wait it out.
A little weather couldn't be anything
she hasn't seen before.
DODGE
It's a bloody navigation hazard.
One boat can't control a ship that
size.
MURPHY
The damn thing's been floating around
for God knows how long and it hasn't
hit anything yet. So we take it easy.
A little of the old push pull.
A long beat as they hold there.
MURPHY
Listen. Forget this job's just a pay
check for a minute. You know I've
been good to you. But I'm prepared
to offer you something better now.
(a beat)
If we do this right, it's worth a
lot of money. A lot of money.
They hold there looking on at him, waiting.
EPPS
Go on.
MURPHY
Salvage fees on a vessel like this
could come in around four million
bucks. At least. Who knows, could be
more. Could be a lot more.
(a beat)
What I'm proposing is... we split it
four ways.
A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer.
MURPHY
Think about it. A million bucks a
piece.
(a beat)
You want to spend the rest of your
days drag-assing tank barges on the
gulf coast, fine. Otherwise, let's
get to work.
Murphy brings up the radio mic as Greer and the others look
on.
MURPHY
(to radio)
United States Coastguard, United
States Coastguard, United States
Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic
Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo
four zero niner two. Over.
After a moment, a distance-warped, coolly professional, female
voice comes back.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic
Warrior. This is United States
Coastguard Station North Island.
Over.
MURPHY
North Island, I wish to declare myself
salvor-in-posession under section
four two charlie of the International
Maritime Convention.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What
type of vessel?
MURPHY
A passenger liner. Over.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
Say again. Over.
Murphy looks to the others, almost smiling.
MURPHY
A passenger liner, north island.
Over.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
What is the vessel name, registry,
and present position? Over.
MURPHY
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will
spell: charlie hotel india mary echo
romeo alpha. No registry information
is available at this time. I have
determined to the best of my ability
that the vessel has been abandoned
on the high seas at position one
seven four west, five seven north
at...
(checking his watch)
Two zero one four hours zulu time.
Over.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please
advise your salvage authority pending
registry check. Over.
MURPHY
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior
over and out.
Murphy slowly throttles up, moving the boat forward. He turns
to see as the Chimera drops back behind them.
Murphy holds the helm steady as the Chimera recedes.
DODGE
Steady as she goes.
Murphy holds the throttle.
DODGE
Right there, skipper. Right there.
Murphy eases forward on the throttle and the turbines rise
in pitch.
Murphy eases forward on the throttle, picking up speed.
Murphy smiles as he looks back at the Chimera following
behind.
CLOSE ON A CHART. The south Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska.
A pencil traces a route.
MURPHY (O.S.)
I figure we go through at the Unimak
Pass here. Refuel at Sanak Island.
Greer looks on from the helm as Murphy, Dodge and Epps stand
over the map table.
MURPHY
With a little extra fuel, weather
permitting, we should make Sitka in
five days without another stop.
DODGE
Sounds reasonable.
GREER
Hypothetically speaking, what if we
get this boat to Sitka and find out
somebody wants it back?
DODGE
They shoulda thought of that when
they let her float away.
GREER
I don't care what, ain't nobody just
gonna let us walk away with a ship
that size.
MURPHY
The law's on our side. If they want
to challenge it, let them try.
EPPS
They must've scuttled it. Nobody
just lets a ship float away.
DODGE
Nobody just scuttles a passenger
liner either.
EPPS
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
MURPHY
Either way, we found it. It's ours
now -- .
An EXPLOSIVE THUD shudders the boat. They look to each other.
DODGE
(moving for the door)
What the...
Greer shoves the throttle back.
Dodge pulls open the door. The place is thick with smoke as
he makes his way to the turbine gauges, Epps and Murphy
behind. Dodge opens the number one turbine cover, looks
inside.
DODGE
Mother fucker!
MURPHY
What is it?
DODGE
Threw a turbine blade.
Dodge looks over the smoking turbine, pulls back an aluminum
intake blade, hot to the touch.
DODGE
Son of a bitch!
Dodge has both turbines opened up as he works.
Lights shine on what was once an elegant interior promenade.
Murphy and Greer stand looking on at it.
MURPHY
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
GREER
Yeah.
EPPS (O.S.)
Check this out.
AT THE PURSERS DESK
Epps looks through a file cabinet behind a heavy wood counter
as Greer and Murphy approach.
EPPS
Everything's still here. Ticket
records, receipts, books of account.
Greer picks one up.
GREER
One first class passage. Elizabeth
James. Dubayy to Halifax. January
29th 1953.
Murphy takes it, looking it over.
MURPHY
Chimera. Flag ship of the Dobbins
Kirk Line. Nova Scotia.
Murphy, Epps, and Greer top a staircase out onto a long,
darkened corridor. They move down. Some of the doors are
open, faint light from port holes showing small cabins with
beds, desks, a few chairs.
Murphy, Epps, and Greer come to a hatchway marked "BRIDGE."
The forward windows show the expanse of the ocean before
them and the rusting foredeck about 150 feet below. Light
from the windows illuminates the bridge as Murphy, Greer and
Epps look around. Despite a little corrosion and a layer of
dirt, everything seems in its place.
MURPHY
(looking through
scattered charts and
papers)
I'd sure like to get my hands on the
general log.
Epps steps up to the wall, where several framed photos hang.
GREER
That must be the old man right there.
The uniformed man in the photo is a gaunt, stern-looking man
from another century, with dark, hollow eyes.
EPPS
Looks like one hell of a stick up
his ass.
GREER
He'd let you off at the nearest port,
that's for sure.
Through the pilothouse windows, the hull of the Chimera
disappears into the darkness beyond the tug's work lights.
Murphy sits at the chart table as Epps steps in.
EPPS
Coffee?
MURPHY
(sitting up)
Yeah. Thanks.
She brings him his cup, seeing the documents he brought back
from the Chimera.
EPPS
(taking a seat)
What'd you find up there?
MURPHY
Some charts. A crew manifest.
(looking them over)
Looks like her last voyage was January
1953. The question is where the hell's
she been since.
EPPS
She was sailing up north, right?
MURPHY
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
EPPS
Well, suppose she got a little further
north than she should have.
Got
stuck in the ice. The passengers and
crew evacuated. She froze into the
ice pack, which moved further north,
where it froze in solid. They write
it off. Fifty years later, the whole
global warming thing happens. The
ice melts, she gets loose and floats
around til somebody runs into her.
Murphy nods, considering it.
MURPHY
As reasonable an explanation as any,
I guess.
Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.
MURPHY
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
EPPS
Nope.
MURPHY
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing
out of New York in 1872.
One day
she was sighted off the coast of
Portugal by a merchant vessel, the
Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei
Gratia got closer, they discovered
that no one was at the helm of the
Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found
her completely deserted. The captain,
his wife, their daughter, and the
entire crew, all gone. The last entry
in their log made no mention of any
trouble. The table was even set for
dinner. And in the nine days after
the last entry, she sailed 700 miles
without anyone aboard.
EPPS
So what did happen?
MURPHY
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of
theories, of course. But we'll never
really know for sure.
EPPS
You think she's sailing without a
crew?
Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.
MURPHY
I think we'd be surprised where a
drifting ship might wind up with a
little wind and the right current.
EPPS
You're more practical than
superstitious.
MURPHY
Only way to be.
Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the
rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.
Murphy enters the pilothouse as the distance-warped VOICE
comes back on the radio.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic
Warrior. This is United States
Coastguard Station North Island.
Over.
Murphy raises the radio mic as Epps, Dodge, and Greer step
in.
MURPHY
(to radio)
North Island, North Island, North
Island. This is tugboat Arctic
Warrior. Over.
After a moment, the same professional, distance-warped voice
comes back.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
Arctic Warrior, we have submitted
your section four two charlie salvage
notification. However, the
International Maritime Authority
record for a passenger vessel Chimera
indicates it was lost at sea in the
Gulf of Oman day two month two year
one nine five three.
Over.
A beat as Murphy holds there.
MURPHY
North Island, please repeat? Over.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel
Chimera was lost at sea day two month
two year one nine five three.
Over.
Another beat as Murphy holds there, as the others look on.
MURPHY
North Island, have you got any
additional information? Over.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The
vessel Chimera was registered to The
Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.
Nova
Scotia. Date of commission day nine
month seven year one nine three two.
Over.
A long beat as the static of the open channel comes back.
MURPHY
Roger, North Island. I am tied to
the passenger vessel Chimera. And
she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat.
Over.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again,
our records indicate the passenger
vessel Chimera was lost at sea.
Over.
MURPHY
Roger, North Island. Please advise
pending further information. Over.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is
United States Coast Guard North Island
Station. Over and out.
A beat as they hold there, thinking about it.
MURPHY
Obviously it's some kind of screw
up. The shipping records aren't a
hundred percent accurate.
DODGE
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got
no business towing a ship that size
anyway. I say we fix the turbines
and hit the highway.
GREER
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got
ourselves a ship? We own a ship,
Dodge.
DODGE
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have
been lost at sea fifty years ago.
You don't think that's just a little
freaky?
EPPS
If this thing turns out to be a ship
everybody thought sank a long time
ago, we just hit the jackpot.
DODGE
Yeah, well how the hell you get
something like that wrong? That's a
damn big boat. It's either sunk or
it ain't.
MURPHY
We all want to get outa here, Dodge.
Especially me. With that boat in
tow. You got three days.
Make the
most of it.
A beat as Dodge looks back, then out at the Chimera.
A pencil point on a map follows across Saudi Arabia, coming
to the Persian Gulf and tracing the coast of the Arab Emirates
to Dubayy.
Murphy sits at his desk over the map. His pencil point follows
the Persian Gulf from Dubayy, through the straight of Hormuz
into the Gulf of Oman. Murphy marks an "X" there. A beat as
he looks on at it.
He opens a large envelope he found aboard the Chimera. He
empties it on the desk. He looks through it, docking receipts
from various ports of call, bills of lading, etc. He looks
over the passenger manifest.
Murphy wakes. He lies on his bunk, having fallen asleep last
night in his clothes, still holding the envelope and some of
the papers inside.
Dodge disassembles the turbine fans on deck as Greer reads
in the shade of the deck house. Dodge's hand slips and he
skins his knuckles.
DODGE
Fucker!
GREER
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a
piece of metal.
DODGE
(inspecting his skinned
knuckles)
Damn mind of it's own.
GREER
(seeing Murphy)
Morning, skipper.
Murphy has stepped out into the sunlight.
MURPHY
Morning.
GREER
You're up late.
MURPHY
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep.
Where's Epps?
DODGE
Went aboard.
MURPHY
She take a radio?
GREER
Yeah.
Murphy nods. A beat.
Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables
and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from
windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She
walks on.
A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry
decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops,
reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette,
lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.
And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY
SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an
instant it is there and gone.
She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She
turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing
to be seen now.
A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares
into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps
steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered
about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK
CAN BE HEARD.
A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the
sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the
TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the
doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room,
coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see
is an ancient grandfather clock.
All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face,
but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.
Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the
TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces
her, now silent.
Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door
where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through
it.
Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port
holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming
pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating
bizarre patterns.
Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs
there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie
on the floor.
Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into
Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment
circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine
ball.
She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera
can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm
sea.
Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to
see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive
diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment
where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to
the ceiling.
Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over
her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing
passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into
the depths of the ship.
Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment,
apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on
loading palettes.
In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps
comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to
reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat
of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly
preserved.
Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more
wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps'
eye.
A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges,
as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.
Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her
light inside.
A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the
shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She
swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object
between broken wood slats.
Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The
yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away
some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram
ingot of gold.
She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the
years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack
of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides
away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to
see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high
and five feet across.
A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in
gold.
The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x
4' stack of gold ingots.
DODGE (O.S.)
What the fuck we gonna do with it?
Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.
GREER
What the fuck you think we gonna do
with it? It's ours, baby. It's all
ours.
Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.
GREER
How much you figure that's worth,
skipper?
MURPHY
(still looking it
over)
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty
million.
GREER
Ho, baby!
EPPS
That's a lot of money for somebody
to just let float away.
Murphy looks up at her from the gold.
MURPHY
Yes, it is.
A beat as they all hold there.
MURPHY
It's a hell of a lot of money.
DODGE
What, you think there's something
funny about it?
MURPHY
A ship with fifty million dollars in
gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems
to care enough to come looking for
it?
GREER
If they thought it was lost at sea,
they probably just wrote it off.
MURPHY
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner
maybe. But fifty million in gold,
they come looking for.
EPPS
Maybe they didn't want it back.
Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
MURPHY
Maybe. But there's always somebody
whose interest's at stake.
GREER
All I gotta say is it looks like
that somebody's us right now.
Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.
EPPS
And it looks like somebody got here
before us too.
The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it
back from the wall.
DODGE
(inspecting it)
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell
you that. Torn parts rusted bad as
the rest of the boat.
MURPHY
Then it happened before they scuttled
her.
EPPS
You mean, before she sank.
GREER
Cargo like this could make a crew
think twice.
MURPHY
That it could.
A beat, as they all look on at the gold.
After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the
galley table.
GREER
Then why didn't they take it.
EPPS
Probably didn't have time.
DODGE
Or somebody stopped them.
MURPHY
Either way, they must've had a pretty
good reason.
GREER
Must be a damn good reason to jump
ship and leave fifty million dollars
aboard.
A beat as they consider it.
DODGE
So what're we gonna do. That's the
big question, right?
MURPHY
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's
as valid as a claim to the vessel
itself. It's ours.
DODGE
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy
stinking rich.
MURPHY
It looks like it.
A beat as they let this sink in.
GREER
So what? We gonna unload the gold
and get a move on?
MURPHY
We leave it where it is. Stick to
the plan.
DODGE
You gotta be kidding? What the hell
we need that tub for, we got fifty
million bucks?
MURPHY
So we get a little more for the boat.
Besides, the gold'll be safer where
it is.
GREER
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that
big piece of shit all the way back
to Sitka.
MURPHY
It's worth the effort. Believe me.
Besides we're gonna need her to prove
the salvage.
EPPS
Why not call for help?
MURPHY
For now the best thing we can do is
to keep quiet about this.
DODGE
Last thing we want is extra partners.
EPPS
Or uninvited guests.
GREER
I heard that.
MURPHY
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
DODGE
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
MURPHY
The sooner we get under way, the
sooner we are to spending what's
ours.
Dodge, wearing a welding mask and gloves, braises an aluminum
fitting over one of the open turbines.
Epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space
beyond the twisted hatch.
GREER
Two hundred twenty. Two twenty one.
(as Epps stacks the
last one)
Two twenty two.
Greer makes a note.
GREER
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of
solid gold.
EPPS
That's what I call a payday.
GREER
Hell yeah.
They slap hands.
Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door
marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.
Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in
dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the
windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is
ordered and in its place.
Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind
it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the
drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and
protractor amidst other sundry items.
DAY
Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in
on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered
curtains.
A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of
slippers lie beneath it.
DAY
Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with
time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the
shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on
at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an
EXPLOSION SOUNDS.
Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and
black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an
extinguisher of his own.
The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well,
the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a
cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.
Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and
hands singed.
An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through
the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in
fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.
DODGE
(over the roar)
Murphy!
Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge
turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.
DODGE
Propane tanks're gonna go!
Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to
the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher
into them, holding it there.
The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning
his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again
as clouds of halon rise up.
Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge
fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the
wall again.
Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine
well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the
deck, and finally out.
They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with
smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything,
but the fire is out.
A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as
he holds the radio mic.
MURPHY
(to radio)
United States Coastguard, this is
tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha
sierra bravo four zero niner two.
Radio check. Over.
A moment, then:
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic
Warrior. This is United States
Coastguard Station North Island.
Your radio check is affirmative.
Over.
MURPHY
Roger that, North Island. Arctic
Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo
four zero niner two. Over and out.
Dodge pours out a few cans of cold chili into a bowl and
takes it to the table where Epps, Greer, and Murphy sit under
the stark light of a gas lantern.
GREER
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve
million and change a piece.
What
you gonna do with your share, skipper?
MURPHY
Not much at all, I guess. Retire.
Live out my golden years and all
that.
DODGE
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger.
Spend my time hauling rich Seattle
business men through the Puget.
MURPHY
How about you Epps?
EPPS
Guess I'll just keep working.
DODGE
What're you crazy?
EPPS
I like my job.
MURPHY
Greer?
GREER
Moving to Sweden.
DODGE
What's so great about Sweden?
GREER
It's a beautiful country. Very clean.
Very civilized. And cold.
EPPS
That's a good thing?
GREER
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder
the better.
DODGE
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish
girls you only gonna dream about.
GREER
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
MURPHY
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be
doing if we don't get this boat
running.
DODGE
Yeah, yeah.
A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS
OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.
GREER
What the hell is that?
The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.
Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of
sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden
crate of other supplies he's gathered.
Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a
few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from
curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the
wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten
velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two
twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and
are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten
up, fifty years ago.
In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling
back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging
there undisturbed.
A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over
which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material
crumbling in her hands.
A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects,
a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette
holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket
watch and fob, and a room key.
Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds
a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a
mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the
folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert
holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman,
presumably his wife.
Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but
stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.
THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing
the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway
creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame
one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in
the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.
Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses,
the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A
beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her,
then turns to walk away.
EPPS
Hey!
Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.
EPPS
Hey, wait a minute! Hey!
MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the
passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto
another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.
Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next
corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.
She turns back, running right into Murphy.
MURPHY
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
EPPS
Did you see him?
MURPHY
Who?
EPPS
The guy. He just came this way.
MURPHY
What guy?
EPPS
There's somebody else on this boat.
MURPHY
What? What the hell're you talking
about.
EPPS
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some
guy.
MURPHY
Are you sure?
EPPS
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
MURPHY
You sure it wasn't me?
EPPS
It wasn't you. It was somebody else.
There's somebody else aboard.
A beat as Murphy looks back at her.
Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.
DODGE
Light in those passages ain't so
good.
EPPS
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I
don't know who it was. But I saw
somebody.
GREER
What'd he look like?
EPPS
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get
a good look. He was far away. But I
saw him. I saw him as sure as you're
standing there.
DODGE
Where's his boat, then? Where's his
crew? He ain't gonna be out here by
himself, that's for damn sure.
GREER
She's so big somebody could come
alongside her on the other side and
we'd never know it.
EPPS
Maybe that is his boat.
DODGE
Gimme a break.
A beat as they sit in silence.
MURPHY
If somebody's aboard her already,
she ain't ours. She's theirs.
DODGE
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam
for fifty years. We found her. She's
ours.
MURPHY
Not in the eyes of the law.
EPPS
So, we find this guy and make a deal
with him.
MURPHY
We don't exactly have the best
bargaining position.
DODGE
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a
professional salvage crew going about
our business. What's some yahoo doing
way out here by himself anyway?
MURPHY
And what do you propose? That we
knock this guy off?
DODGE
Why not? Why the fuck not?
A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.
DODGE
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million.
We gonna let this guy just take it
from us? One guy?
EPPS
So we kill him?
DODGE
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we
gotta do to preserve our interest.
GREER
I don't know.
MURPHY
Let's just take it easy here, alright?
Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
GREER
Supposing he wants to get bad with
us?
DODGE
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
EPPS
Maybe he isn't alone.
They consider this a moment.
GREER
I say we off-load some of that gold
now.
MURPHY
Would you hold on just a minute here,
please? Look, there's no reason to
panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine.
It's a big boat.
Chances're real
good he doesn't even know about the
gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be
the wiser.
(a beat)
The gold stays where it is til we're
ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a
hell of a lot safer there than here.
DODGE
What if that fucker finds it before
we're ready to go?
MURPHY
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight
off. Low man first.
EPPS
Guess that'd be me. Again.
MURPHY
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't
care if you don't sleep for a week.
The sooner you're done, the sooner
we can get out of here. How's the
food situation?
GREER
Pretty low all around.
MURPHY
We'll have to take it easy then. I
don't think we'll find much aboard
the ship, but it's probably worth
looking around.
EPPS
Say we run into this guy again.
A beat as they consider this.
MURPHY
If he's reasonable, maybe we can
make some kind of deal. If not.
We'll have to re-consider our options.
DODGE
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit
up.
Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a
locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back
the shotgun and a box of shells.
A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps
approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is
terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.
Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the
cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching
the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping
there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.
She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to
the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment.
She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos
to pour herself a cup of coffee.
Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY
somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds
there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING
SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.
As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly
somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.
Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING
CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the
silence.
Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive
propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.
Finally she comes out into...
Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She
continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing
into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.
She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.
Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe
her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again
echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through
the line of burners. Nothing moves.
Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive
watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding
herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks.
THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.
She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding
her light out before her. She comes to the end of the
compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still
closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting
machinery and a stack of oil drums.
She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the
BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.
She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady
as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is
metallic and staccato.
She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums
have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs
her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at
the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way
through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that
betrays a throughway to the outside.
The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of
oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to
fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to
push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.
She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off
the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic
flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large
albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top
of the ship and freedom.
MURPHY
Murphy to Epps.
She settles back, exhausted.
MURPHY
Murphy to Epps.
EPPS
(taking her radio)
Epps.
MURPHY
You just shoot at something?
EPPS
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid
bird.
She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment,
when she smells something really awful.
She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the
toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam
of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light
on the form to see that it is a human torso.
A large gash
runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by
scavenging birds.
She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on
something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in
front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with
wide, unseeing eyes.
It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines
her light back to the headless torso.
She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent
steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried
blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind
her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.
She spins around to see another body above her. Except this
one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam
pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum
to mouth.
One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below
it.
A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another
bent pipe.
A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various
rotting parts.
GREER (O.S.)
Ho-ly shit.
MURPHY (O.S.)
Couldn't have happened much more
than a month ago.
Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the
remains of the headless torso.
MURPHY
Bodies're too fresh.
DODGE
Fresh ain't the first word that comes
to mind.
Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through
it.
MURPHY
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
(standing)
Obviously we aren't the first to
come across this ship. They probably
stumbled across it just like we did.
GREER
And look what happened.
DODGE
Damn barbaric is what it is.
MURPHY
Could be meant as a warning.
GREER
Stay away. Or else.
EPPS
Because of the gold.
MURPHY
That'd be my guess.
DODGE
So whoever did this might still be
around.
GREER
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something
to do with it.
MURPHY
Maybe.
A beat as they consider the implications of this.
EPPS
So, what? We report this? Call the
Coastguard?
Another beat as they hold there.
DODGE
Let's not be too hasty.
GREER
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it
make if we report it now or later?
We call this in now, gonna be
Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all
over the place.
A beat as nobody's too sure about this.
MURPHY
Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough
to fix that boat, I don't know what
is.
DISSOLVE TO:
Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life,
turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of
smoke.
DODGE
All the seals and gaskets're shot.
Anything that was rubber burned up.
Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.
MURPHY
Can't you use something else?
DODGE
I might be able to find something on
the ship. But it's gonna take time.
MURPHY
Do what you need to do. Just do it
fast.
DODGE
Right.
Epps sleeps in her bunk.
Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.
DODGE
I need lag bolts, especially one
inch standard. And sheet metal.
Preferably steel, about a sixteenth
of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll
do.
GREER
I ain't no mechanic, just so you
know.
DODGE
You find anything that even looks
like a compressor. I don't care what,
grab it.
Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and
communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and
cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.
He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call
log. He takes a seat, paging through it.
Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has
difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when
he slips.
GREER
Dammit!
A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT
SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human,
somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.
GREER
Dodge?
He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.
Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING
AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.
GREER
Dodge!
Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened
passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it
echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.
Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks
down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through
a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY
HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me
your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").
He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at
the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He
moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and
the light falling from the open door.
Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log
book.
On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries,
coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble
notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"
His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to:
"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.
Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"
His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.
Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing
vessel 'China Sea.'"
MURPHY
Captain relieved of command.
He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final
entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General
SOS."
He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled
in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL
OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it,
but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT
BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open,
but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL
CLOSES AGAIN.
Murphy takes the radio.
MURPHY
This is Murphy. Anybody trying to
call me? Over.
He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.
Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there,
but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.
MURPHY
Greer? Dodge?
Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy
holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY,
STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:
VOICE (V.O. RADIO)
"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster
to the crow. "Where are you now? I
know, but won't say so."
Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.
MURPHY
Who is this?
The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if
someone were there but not speaking.
MURPHY
Who is this!!
The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.
VOICE
Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle
toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle
toy.
The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.
Murphy squeezes the talk button.
MURPHY
Greer! Dodge!
Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD
CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.
Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio
sounds.
DODGE
Dodge to Murphy.
MURPHY
(taking radio)
Murphy.
DODGE
You better get down here quick,
skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
MURPHY
What is it?
DODGE
I think you better see this for
yourself.
Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw
Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls
from the open door as he approaches.
AT CABIN 400
As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the
middle of the cabin.
DODGE
I found him like this.
Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and
his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so
that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists
quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.
Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed,
his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face
contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering
nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in
tongues.
GREER
Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska

AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE
As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.
EPPS (O.S.)
Hard to say.
BACK TO SCENE
Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing
as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy
looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.
EPPS
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a
coma.
DODGE
A what?
EPPS
I don't know what else you'd call
it. He's breathing on his own, but
his pupils are completely blown out.
He's totally unresponsive to pain.
(a beat)
What happened up there?
DODGE
I heard a scream. When I got there I
found him on the floor. He was having
some kind of seizure. I didn't see
anybody else.
MURPHY
He must've seen something.
A beat as they consider this.
EPPS
Other than the obvious, there's
nothing wrong with him that I can
see, not on the outside.
DODGE
Then what the hell happened to him?
Another beat as they hold there.
MURPHY
Just before I heard him yell there
was somebody on the radio.
EPPS
Greer?
MURPHY
I don't know. No. Not Greer.
Somebody.
Another long beat as they think about this.
MURPHY
It was a man's voice. Repeating some
sort of children's rhyme. I don't
know, it didn't make any sense. You
didn't hear it?
DODGE
Not me.
Another beat as this sinks in.
EPPS
(looking to Greer)
He needs a doctor.
MURPHY
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many
signal flares you can scrounge up.
(to Epps, meaning
Dodge)
Keep an eye on him.
A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as
he holds the radio mic.
MURPHY
(to radio)
United States Coastguard, United
States Coastguard, United States
Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic
Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo

No response.
MURPHY
(to radio)
United States Coastguard, United
States Coastguard, United States
Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic
Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo
four zero niner two. Over.
Again, no response. He holds there, then finally:
MURPHY
(to radio)
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. To any vessel.
This is Arctic Warrior.
Arctic
Warrior. Arctic Warrior.
Whiskey
alpha sierra bravo four zero niner
two. Last known position one seven

afloat and drifting.
Require
immediate medical assistance for one
person, possibly comatose. I am a

tug, hove to at port bow of disabled
passenger liner Chimera. I repeat,
Chimera. Over.
Only the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK.
Greer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door
comes open and Murphy steps in.
MURPHY
How's he doing?
EPPS
Same. Any luck?
MURPHY
No. I'll try again later.
A beat as they look on at Greer.
Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log
book Murphy found in the radio room.
EPPS
(reading it)
They're dead in the water that
morning. Four hours later the
captain's relieved of his command.
And that evening they issue a general
SOS.
MURPHY
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record
of being lost at sea. I don't think
mutiny's out of the question here.
DODGE
(taking a seat)
On a passenger ship in 1953?
MURPHY
If they knew what they were carrying.
EPPS
You're saying they mutinied for the
gold?
MURPHY
If they were close enough to shore,
they probably figured they could get
away in the lifeboats.
EPPS
Only something must've gone wrong.
DODGE
Yeah, way wrong.
A beat as they consider it.
DODGE
So. I got a question. Just from a,
you know, purely technical standpoint.
We call the Coastguard.
Coastguard
shows up. What exactly is the plan?
MURPHY
How do you mean?
DODGE
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot
of questions. About us. About those
bodies. About the gold. Seems like
we oughta be prepared is all.
MURPHY
I guess the best strategy's just to
tell them the truth.
DODGE
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.
When there's more than a few hundred
million dollars involved, that's a
whole new deal.
MURPHY
What do you propose?
DODGE
For starters, getting that gold off
the ship. What they don't know about
isn't gonna bother them.
A beat as Murphy holds there.
MURPHY
There's no way we're gonna hide a
few thousand pounds of gold from the
Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be
safer where it is.
DODGE
With all due respect, skipper.
(a beat)
Part of that up there's mine. I'd
kinda like to have a little say in
what happens to it.
A beat as Murphy looks on.
MURPHY
Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get
back to shore, you can do whatever
you want with your share. But until
then, the gold stays right where it
is.
Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of
coffee.
Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.
He steps forward, crossing to the corner.
The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely
demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.
Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from
behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.
MURPHY
Just what the hell do you think you're
doing?!
DODGE
I don't know what you're talking
about?
MURPHY
I think you know.
DODGE
Maybe you can tell me then.
Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.
MURPHY
The radio!
DODGE
(not having a clue)
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Murphy tightens his grip.
DODGE
Take it easy, willya? What about the
radio?!
MURPHY
You smashed it!
DODGE
What?!
MURPHY
Don't lie to me!
DODGE
What the fuck -- ?
MURPHY
You didn't want us calling anybody.
Too liable to ruin your big payday.
DODGE
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
Murphy tightens his grip still more.
DODGE
I didn't touch the fucking radio!
(a beat)
Ever occur to you there's somebody
else on that boat, skipper?
MURPHY
Conveniently enough for you.
DODGE
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting
him go.
DODGE
Jesus.
Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.
EPPS (O.S.)
Murphy.
They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.
EPPS
It's Greer.
Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a
jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to
see them.
GREER
Never been more thirsty in my life.
MURPHY
Drink up then.
Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a
seat, looking on at him.
MURPHY
How're you feeling?
GREER
Lost my sea legs.
EPPS
Any dizziness?
GREER
No.
EPPS
Headache, nausea, lights?
GREER
Lights?
EPPS
Sudden flashes of light.
GREER
I feel fine.
DODGE
What day is it?
GREER
I don't know. Tuesday?
DODGE
Wrong. It's Friday.
EPPS
Try Wednesday.
DODGE
Right. Wednesday.
A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.
GREER
What happened?
MURPHY
You don't remember?
GREER
Last thing I remember I was aboard
the Chimera. Down somewhere in there
scavenging around.
MURPHY
You've been out for about a day.
GREER
Say what?
MURPHY
Dodge found you out cold in one of
the cabins.
Greer only holds there.
GREER
Oh, man.
MURPHY
We heard you scream. Any idea what
you might've seen?
GREER
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real
interested to know myself.
Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink
of water.
MURPHY
The ah... the radio's out.
EPPS
What?
MURPHY
Somebody took it out of commission
last night.
A beat as they all hold there.
MURPHY
Smashed it up pretty bad.
EPPS
But, who -- ?
DODGE
The skipper seems to think I did it.
That I'm more interested in that
gold than my own safety or the safety
of my fellow shipmates.
A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.
EPPS
Did you?
DODGE
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Another beat as they hold there.
MURPHY
Regardless of how it happened, there
isn't much of a chance to fix it.
The odds of another vessel in range
of the walkie-talkies are almost
astronomical. So, as of today, we're
pretty much on our own out here.
Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the
ship.
Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an
aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees
that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.
Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He
looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.
He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them,
yanking them loose, breaking them off.
The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty
assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.
WITH EPPS
A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten
corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and
the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees
that it is the ship's log.
EPPS
Murphy.
Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the
very end. The last pages have been ripped out.
EPPS
Looks like part of the general log.
Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.
EPPS
"The crew have gone mad with greed
and fight among themselves like wild
dogs over fresh kill."
MURPHY
February first.
EPPS
The same day she supposedly went
down.
MURPHY
Must not've been the captain's entry.
He was probably out of the picture
by then.
Epps continues to read.
EPPS
"Their lacking diligence has
undoubtedly caused the collision.
Distress calls have been made."
MURPHY
Collision? With what?
EPPS
The page's missing. Then their SOS
was real.
MURPHY
But where's the damage?
EPPS
Maybe the other ship took the worst
of it.
MURPHY
If it was a ship she hit.
A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.
DODGE
Dodge to Murphy!
Murphy reaches down for his radio.
MURPHY
(to radio)
Yeah.
DODGE
You better get down here right now!
We're taking water! Big time!
Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to
one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.
Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly
as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light
under it. She sits down, trying it.
Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the
stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.
MURPHY (O.S.)
You shouldn't be down here alone.
Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.
DODGE
Just wanted to check on our little
baby.
A beat as they look on at the gold.
DODGE
That oughta buy a man pretty much
anything he wants.
MURPHY
If money can buy what he wants.
DODGE
I don't figure there's much I want
money can't buy.
MURPHY
Then you're a lucky man.
Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.
MURPHY
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight.
You're up first.
DODGE
Right.
Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge
looks after him.
Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case,
scavenging for food.
Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large,
open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND
THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.
EPPS
Murphy?
No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the
galley. Nothing.
Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry
to the swimming pool. She walks on.
Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at
the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.
She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a
GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.
Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is
porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her
clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.
GIRL
You must leave.
A beat as Epps stands there.
EPPS
(finally)
Who are you?
From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully
discern the girl's features.
GIRL
There's great evil here, more than
you can know. Leave now or you may
never leave.
EPPS
But --
A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.
When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND
ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is
now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the
depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising
up from the bottom.
She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the
top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when
the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching
the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red
glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.
As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow
spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear
that the water is not water at all but blood.
And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is
illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.
Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It
is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The
bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.
Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same
point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then
another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately
to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.
EPPS
My God....
Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the
blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far
apart.
She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the
surface.
The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches
out, near tears, helpless to do anything.
EPPS
No!!
Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.
The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to
its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking
on in disbelief.
MURPHY (O.S.)
You okay?
Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.
EPPS
Yeah.
(looking back to the
pool)
Yeah, fine.
A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.
The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark
room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that
it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his
arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and
he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something
between a night terror and a seizure.
Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of
morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming
down when Greer steps in.
GREER
Looks like we're in a strong current.
(closing the door)
Must be making almost five knots
full on ass backwards.
Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.
GREER
Nasty little swell outa the north
west too.
Murphy nods as he looks out.
MURPHY
Let's just hope somebody sees us
first out here.
A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.
Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE
PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.
She goes through them, coming to a section that says
"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."
She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening
it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to
Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back
to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti,
Angela age: 17.
She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6,
11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein,
David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming
to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols,
Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment:
"400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was
found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.
Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.
EPPS
Dodge.
(no answer, knocking
again)
Dodge.
DODGE (O.S.)
(finally, from inside)
What?
EPPS
Get up.
DODGE (O.S.)
Yeah, yeah.
Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat
as she holds there in the darkness.
Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful,
increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to
speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words
are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical
language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.
Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.
Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another
passageway.
He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors
of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE.
It stops.
He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light
back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the
CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.
He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL
REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.
DODGE
Dodge.
SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END
SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other
end of the passageway.
BACK TO SCENE
He gets no response, then presses the talk button.
DODGE
This is Dodge. Over.
He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN
THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON
THE RADIO:
VOICE
"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster
to the crow. "Where are you now? I
know but won't say so."
Dodge hits the talk button.
DODGE
Who is this?
The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.
DODGE
Identify yourself, motherfucker!
SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END
SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far
end of the passageway.
BACK TO SCENE
Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:
VOICE
Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle
toy.
THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.
VOICE
Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
.
Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he
can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM
IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle
of light.
ON SHOTGUN
As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in
frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun
muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing
pulls it away.
Epps shines her light on something.
EPPS
Check it out.
Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They
are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.
GREER
I don't even want to know what that's
gonna taste like now.
EPPS
Better than starving to death.
Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.
MURPHY
Murphy to Epps.
EPPS
(raising the radio)
Epps, over.
MURPHY
Either of you seen Dodge?
She looks to Greer who shakes his head.
EPPS
Nope.
MURPHY
He's not on deck and I can't raise
him on the radio.
Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.
MURPHY
(into radio)
Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.
Over.
Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's
voice can be heard on it.
MURPHY
Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.
Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.
MURPHY (O.S.)
Epps? You there?
EPPS
Right here.
WITH MURPHY
As he moves along as well, eyes open.
MURPHY
Greer?
WITH GREER
As Greer moves along too.
GREER
Yeah, yeah.
Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across
bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds
there, listening. It is echoey, distant.
EPPS
Murphy?
No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN,
far off, unintelligible. It stops.
She moves on, shinning her light.
Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight
before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.
Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for
her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint
it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.
Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of
standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING
CAN BE HEARD, then stops.
It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the
GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.
Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with
a start.
GREER
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
She holds there a beat, looking around.
GREER
You okay?
EPPS
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard
something is all.
GREER
What?
EPPS
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.
Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the
darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.
MOVING WITH EPPS
As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and
low to the deck. She stops.
WITH THE LIGHT
As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it,
stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She
reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still
on.
She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the
darkness and starts off, Greer following.
Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go,
when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.
It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up,
inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot
appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.
She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to
see that it is blood.
She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging
suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them
from the darkness.
He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high
pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging
limp beside it.
Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides
it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.
GREER
Can't find the shotgun.
MURPHY
So whoever did this now has our
shotgun.
GREER
Doesn't look like it much matters.
EPPS
What do we do with him?
MURPHY
Leave him till we can get some help.
(a beat)
From now on, nobody comes down here.
GREER
What about the gold?
MURPHY
Leave it.
GREER
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be
reasonable here.
MURPHY
You think whoever did this is
reasonable?
GREER
All I'm saying is that gold's worth
a lot more to us now than it ever
was.
EPPS
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead
and all you can think about is cashing
in your share.
GREER
I didn't sign up to go home empty
handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll
over for the freaky motherfucker did
this.
MURPHY
Nobody's going anywhere with that
gold now. Anybody tries to board,
we'll know about it.
(a beat)
You can do what you want, Greer.
But neither of us is gonna risk saving
your ass down here if it comes to
that.
GREER
Fine with me.
Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She
moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where
Greer was found, room 400.
She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating.
She opens it.
The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though
spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting
room in the front, is a bedroom.
Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.
A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the
foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the
process of being unpacked.
From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other
contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.
Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on
an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a
few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one
of the books, opening it.
Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs
to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."
A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a
children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of
a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle
doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I
know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny
whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.
She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos
of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the
mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older
girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool,
KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.
She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly
plays "Daisy."
AT THE TABLE
Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly
winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up,
looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.
A beat.
The dirty white light falling into the room through the
windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot
see. His expression is empty, hollow.
EPPS
Greer?
He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches,
stepping up.
EPPS
You okay?
Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly
turns to see her.
A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty
look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes
hard.
She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his
wrists, fighting him.
EPPS
Greer!
His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make
little difference.
EPPS
Let go!
She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching
with it.
GREER
Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska
getofedobrodijotosiantosg.
He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace,
eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass
and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still
choking her.
He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe
the rest of the way.
Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a
basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls,
a little out of reach.
She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles
her.
Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.
She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting
with Greer's head.
He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks
in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger
marks.
She fumbles her radio up.
EPPS
(into radio)
Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!
Get down here now!!
Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.
She throws down the radio.
A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's
dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but
he dives, taking her down.
He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He
raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!
Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch
and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her
with his other hand.
She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the
head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across
the floor.
She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and
bleeding.
He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his
waist to do God knows what.
Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that
she has unhinged her gill knife.
As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife
with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through
his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.
After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody,
wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears
in the doorway.
Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from
behind at full speed, knocking him down.
Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her
feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over
Greer, bringing it down on his head.
CUT TO BLACK
Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.
Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops
at the bottom, now starting to come to.
OUTSIDE
Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel
pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.
Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of
armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in
the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as
he speaks in his nonsensical language.
MURPHY (V.O.)
Must've been him all along.
Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.
MURPHY
Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat.
Killed Dodge. Would've killed you.
He's off his nut, no doubt there.
They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.
MURPHY
What do you think?
EPPS
Could be a stroke. Who knows?
(a beat)
The general log said the crew were
fighting among themselves. "Like
wild dogs."
MURPHY
Over the gold.
EPPS
Maybe it was more than that.
Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He
presses his face to the glass.
EPPS
They went crazy.
MURPHY
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not
like him.
A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his
hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his
wounds smearing in broad red streaks.
Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white
light from the skylight falling on him from above.
Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making
her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.
The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops,
raises the radio.
EPPS
(holding down talk
button)
Murphy?
She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.
EPPS
Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?
Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the
channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable
presence on the other end.
EPPS
(raising the radio)
Who is this?
The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound
of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE
RADIO.
Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES
TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor,
stopping there.
At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.
The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the
MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF
THE CORRIDOR.
Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES,
coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.
Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.
The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment,
she continues on, coming to the bedroom.
Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.
She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio
CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:
VOICE
"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster
to the crow. Where are you now? I
know but won't say so."
She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find
the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme
"The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the
page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.
VOICE
Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle
toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle
toy.
On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes
it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA
SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows
a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across
the room.
MOTHER
"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster
to the crow. Where are you now? I
know but won't say so."
On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the
photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor
with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.
MOTHER
"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster
to the crow. Where are you now? I
know but won't say so." Cassandra,
if you insist on playing that while
I read I'll just stop right now.
THE GIRL
Sorry.
The room is warm with light, restored to its original
condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen,
no longer holding the whistle.
A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom
wearing a new coat.
FATHER
What do you think?
MOTHER
He certainly did shorten it, didn't
he?
FATHER
I thought this was all the rage.
KATIE
Maybe last year.
Katie joins them from the outer room.
FATHER
What about this year?
KATIE
It's not your color anyway.
GIRL
I like it, daddy.
FATHER
Well thank you!
GIRL
Daddy, how much longer before we
start moving again?
FATHER
They're working on the engines, honey.
As soon as they fix them we'll be on
our way.
Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with
sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and
objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their
original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE
HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.
Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks
in to see people doing various things, some packing and
putting their things in order.
Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three
STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift
him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and
protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into
Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the
galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end
and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen
among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from
the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their
neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other
end.
A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway
as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a
door slams shut.
The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE
SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere
As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN
fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering
the contents.
Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man
and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD
takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches
over and slams the door shut. She continues on.
Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room
400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from
inside.
Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting
room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several
MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships
officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.
The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from
between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of
the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them,
the bed rocking, the others looking on.
Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied
behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of
the bed.
EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE
EPPS' POV
a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her
feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.
The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of
the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all,
but Katie.
The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of
the other mutineers steps up to Epps.
MUTINEER
You like that, daddy? I'll show you
something else now.
The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so
that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe
over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling
blur --
EPPS (V.O.)
NO!!!!
BACK TO SCENE
The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the
room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned
state.
KATIE
It isn't real.
Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where
she stands.
KATIE
Many bad things have happened here.
But you mustn't allow the evil inside.
I tell you this because you can see
me. The others can't. But you must
leave. You must leave.
A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns
back Katie is gone.
Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.
MURPHY
Epps to Murphy.
Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.
EPPS
Epps to Murphy.
Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out
onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be
seen.
As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is
nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken
out.
A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF
METAL follows it.
Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up,
almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas
duffle.
EPPS
What happened?
MURPHY
We hit land.
EPPS
What?
MURPHY
We're in an island chain. It's only
a matter of time before we hit another
one.
EPPS
Greer's gone. He broke out of the
tank.
Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING
shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.
Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As
they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the
passage some distance down.
AT THE OTHER END
Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face
down in the passage.
They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the
body over. It is Greer, dead.
EPPS
He's been shot.
Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.
MURPHY
Let's get the hell out of here.
Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.
Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its
width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down
where several vent ducts lead in different directions below
it.
Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a
passageway.
Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.
The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.
The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.
Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.
Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.
Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when
something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.
FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back
into the shadows, holding there.
The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the
other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.
Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at
the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch
slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN
THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving
toward it.
As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open,
swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.
A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps
into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot
ricochets off the metal around her.
She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings
down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.
AT THE BOTTOM
Epps gets up, runs.
WITH MURPHY
Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.
Epps moves quickly along.
Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.
- BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking
on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS
IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the
ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below,
as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.
She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it
becomes absolutely deafening.
The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move
and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back
and forth.
Murphy slows and finally stops.
A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING
GROWS STILL LOUDER.
Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away,
when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing
out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate
of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH
WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.
Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through
the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a
HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.
The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off,
water pouring in behind it.
A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in
through the breach.
Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end
of the passage. He begins backing away.
Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already
half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING
EXERTION.
Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo
compartment.
Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris,
tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead
as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.
Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under
the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she
was.
WITH EPPS
Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and
the bulkhead.
The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.
Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in
his pockets.
Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is
trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.
ABOVE THE WATER
The level of the water has now almost completely reached the
deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.
The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last
ingot and makes his way for the exit.
Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.
She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at
the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the
murky water.
Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the
water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.
They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.
As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.
It is Katie.
She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her
hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.
The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she
finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the
breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.
Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks
back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the
light of the surface.
Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.
Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the
top.
A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with
difficulty.
