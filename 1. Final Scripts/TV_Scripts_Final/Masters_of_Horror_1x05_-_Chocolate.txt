       FADE IN: 

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT 

      It is dark, anonymous. Tight on the ravaged face of JAMIE EVANS, a man 
      in his 30s who would look appealingly boyish, if not for the drying 
      blood on his face and clothing.  

      We don't know whose blood it is, but we catch shocking glimpses of it 
      throughout the room's shadows. This was quite a bloodbath. 

      The only LIGHT in the otherwise shadowy room washes out his face. He 
      appears broken, exhausted. 

                                      JAMIE 
                                (directly into camera) 
                        Have you ever been in love? 

      Blue CIGARETTE SMOKE billows towards him. 

                                      MAN (O/S) 
                        I've been married for 17 years. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        That isn t what I said. Have ever been 
                        in love? Really in love. 

                                      MAN (O/S) 
                        Sure. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Not like I have. 

                                      MAN (O/S) 
                        Oh, no. You're special. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I mean it. No man ever loved a woman 
                        the way I loved her. 

                                      MAN (O/S) 
                      I can see that by all that blood 
                        splattered all over your shirt. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Fine. You can call it murder. It 
                        doesn t matter. 

                                      MAN (O/S) 
                        Let's back up a little bit here. I'm 
                        still not clear on how this whole 
                        thing started. 



 1 
                                       JAMIE 
                        How many times do I have to tell it? 

                                      MAN (O/S) 
                        Till it starts to sound like the 
                        truth, God help me. 
                              (deep sigh) 
                        Just humor me, okay? Start from the 
                        beginning. 

                                      JAMIE 
                                (impatient) 
                      I got up, I got dressed, I went to 
                        work.  

                                      MAN (O/S) 
                        Where do you work? 

 
      EXT. COUGAR CULINARY LABORATORIES -- DAY 

    A faceless brick warehouse building sits on the other side of the 
      tracks in a Chicago suburb. It s not exactly seedy, but not MIT either. 

                                      JAMIE (V/O) 
                        Cougar Culinary Labs in Chicago. I 
                        create artificial flavors... 

 
      INT. COUGAR CULINARY LABORATORIES -- DAY 

      MOVE with Jamie along a ROW of BEAKERS, TEST TUBES, BOWLS, and a jumble 
      of other LOW-TECH lab and kitchen UTENSILS. The lab appears fairly 
      slapdash, bordering on GRUNGY. There's an AQUARIUM on Jamie's 
      workbench. 

                                      JAMIE (V/O) 
                        For the food industry. 

      Jamie's a different man-- clear-eyed, energetic, natural good looks 
      hiding behind owlish reading glasses, dressed in jeans and rolled 
      sleeves, loading water from the cooler into a beaker, until he notices 
      that MAGIC ROCKS are growing in the drinking water.  

                                      JAMIE 
                        Who put the Magic Rocks in the water 
                        cooler? 

      WALLY is a dynamo who's just hit 45-- balding and a little rat-like, 
        enthusiastic and funny. He wears a lab coat not because he has to, but 
      because he likes the costume. A bag of CHILI-CHEESE FRITOS spills on 
      the table at his elbow.  



 2 
       He stirs a concoction on his hotplate in the corner of the lab, trying 
      to stifle a laugh.  

      Jamie smells something from all the way across the lab. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Jesus, Wally, chili and cheese Fritos?  

      Jamie carries the water back to his station. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Wow. You could be in a crowded stadium 
                        and know who farted. Maybe you didn't, 
                        but the Frito is nature's perfect 
                        food. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Particularly the chili-and-cheese 
                        variety. 

                                      WALLY 
                          Particularly. Low in carbs. You look 
                        it up. 

      Jamie mixes ingredients in a beaker with a Popsicle stick. He takes a 
      taste, savors it expectantly, then spits it out. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Ugh. There is just no way to perfectly 
                        synthesize honeydew melon. It's 
                          impossible. 

                                      WALLY 
                        I've been telling you that all week. 
                        We came close in '98, but the test 
                        rats gave birth to two-headed 
                        offspring. Legal felt that was a 
                          significant drawback.  

      Jamie laughs. Wally turns back to his microscope. 

                                      WALLY (CONT D) 
                        How much call do you get for 
                        artificial honeydew melon, anyway? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        It's a challenge. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Challenge schmallenge. Give them 
                          cantaloupe.

       INT. COUGAR CULINARY LABORATORIES -- LATER 

      It's noon, and Wally and Jamie have the room all to themselves and 
      their takeout lunch. Jamie picks at a wilting CAESAR SALAD, mooning 
      enviously over Wally's real food.  

      Wally looks disparagingly at Jamie's plate as he digs into a big 
      meatball sub, dripping with melted cheese and marinara. He eats it with 
      potato chips and a giant soft drink.  

                                      WALLY 
                        How can you eat that rabbit food? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I have to eat this rabbit food. If 
                        not, I blow up like a weather balloon. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Not me, man. I can eat till I puke and 
                        never gain an ounce. High metabolism 
                        or something. I don t know. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Fuck you. 

                                      WALLY 
                        So, Mr. Newly Single, be-all-that-you-
                        can-be, how's the love life? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Well, me and the left hand are going 
                        steady now. 

                                      WALLY 
                        All newly fit and fabulous and no 
                        place to go, huh? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I just need a little time to, you 
                        know, think about stuff. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Hey, my band s playing tonight. Why 
                        don't you come? Who knows, you might 
                        meet some rock 'n' roll nymphomaniac. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I don't think I'm ready for that.  

                                      WALLY 
                        Oh, come on, man. A bachelor night. 
                        It'll be great. 

      Jamie shakes his head.

                                       JAMIE 
                      I don't think so. Not tonight. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Oh, come on. it might be the last time 
                      I ever play. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Bullshit. You'll be strapping a guitar 
                        on till the day you die. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Don't be so sure. I just turned 45 on 
                        Wednesday. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Really? Happy birthday. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Hardly. What's more depressing than a 
                          45-year-old failed rock 'n' roller? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Well, how about child support, 
                        alimony, and an empty downtown 
                        apartment? 

      Wally nods in agreement. 

                                      WALLY 
                        All right, you win. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT   ENTRANCE -- NIGHT 

      The apartment is depressingly barren, the domain of a newly divorced 
      man. Jamie enters and turns on the light.  

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT -- KITCHEN   MOMENTS LATER 

      Jamie opens the refrigerator. He grabs a chunk of white cheese, looks 
      at the mold growing on it and tosses it back. 

      He takes what's left of a loaf of whole-grain bread and spreads it with 
      peanut butter. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 

      Jamie settles into the sofa and flips on the television. A TV CHEF 
      prepares an outrageous meal. He changes the channel. 

      He bites into his stale bread. 


 5 
       The show is replaced by a tempting, lovingly gooey shot of a delectable 
      hot fudge sundae. He changes the channel. 

    A sweating NAKED COUPLE is coupling, huffing and puffing as they make 
      passionate love. Jamie can't take it. He turns the TV off. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT -- JAMIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 

      On the NIGHT STAND is a small, framed SNAPSHOT. 

      Jamie climbs into bed and opens a book, coming across some torn pages. 
      At first annoyed, he picks them up, then notices a young child has 
      scrawled in crayon all over the page. 

      Jamie lovingly traces the crayon marks with his fingers, wistful, and 
      looks over at the picture next to him. It s a photo Jamie and a 
      beautiful six-year-old boy, his son BOOTH. Jamie's estranged wife, 
      VANESSA has been ripped out. 

      Jamie's face is reflected in the glass over the picture. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I miss you, baby boy... 

      Jamie flips the light off. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT -- JAMIE'S BEDROOM -- LATER 

      It is after 2:00 a.m. and Jamie is heavy into REM-sleep. He licks his 
      lips, tasting something in his sleep. Slowly, groggily, he awakens, 
      opening his eyes, looking pleased at first, then confused. The taste is 
      still in his mouth. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Chocolate... 

                                      JAMIE (V/O) 
                      I thought it was some kind of wish 
                        fulfillment& 

 
      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM   NIGHT 

      Close on Jamie. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Dream after all those weeks of rabbit 
                        food, but the taste was still in my 
                        mouth when I woke up. And I could 
                        smell it, too. It was really good 
                        stuff. Custom. Bittersweet, with just 
                      a hint of Jasmine tea. Really special. 


 6 
                                       MAN (O/S) 
                        How do you know it wasn't a dream? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        It wasn't a dream. I just kept tasting 
                        someone else's chocolate. 
 

      EXT. CITY STREET -- VANESSA'S HOUSE -- DAY 

      Jamie walks up a residential street. He stops at a homey yellow house 
      with the proverbial white picket fence. After a moments, he goes up and 
      KNOCKS on the door. 

      The front door opens and his estranged wife, Vanessa, stands there, 
      intelligent and earnest. She maintains her distance.  

      Before any words are spoken, Jamie suddenly SNEEZES. 

                                      VANESSA 
                          Gesundheit. 

                                      JAMIE  
                        You wearing rose oil again? 

                                      VANESSA 
                              (a verbal stab) 
                        No reason not to... 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I just came by to check in on you and 
                        Booth. 

                                      VANESSA 
                                (beat) 
                        Come on in. 

      She opens the door wider and stands back to let him enter. 

      Jamie sneezes again O/S. 

                                      VANESSA (O/S) 
                        You look tired. 

 
      INT. VANESSA S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM   CONTINUOUS 

      It is neat, comfortable, lived-in and homey. They are as awkward with 
      one another as the newly-divorced can be. 

                                      VANESSA 
                        You okay? 



 7 
                                       JAMIE 
                        I'm all right. You look nice. You 
                        going out? 

                                      VANESSA 
                        Mm-hm. 

      Jamie SNEEZES again. Vanessa slides out of her blouse and into a 
      sweater. As she pulls the sweater over her head, Jamie notices a mark 
      on her breast. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Is that a hickey? 

      Vanessa's head pops through the sweater, when suddenly, six-year-old 
      Booth comes charging from the staircase. 

                                      BOOTH 
                        Daddy! 

      Booth takes a flying leap at Jamie, wrapping his arms around him.  

                                      BOOTH 
                        Are you moving back home now? 

                                      VANESSA 
                        Daddy's just visiting. 

                                      BOOTH 
                        You said that you were just testing. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I know, but that was a long time ago. 
                        The test part is done now, and lucky 
                        you. You've got two places to stay 
                        now, just like a rich movie star. 

                                      BOOTH 
                        Do rich movie stars have a mommy in 
                        one house and a daddy in another one? 

                                      VANESSA 
                        Most of them. Come on, honey. You 
                        better get ready for class. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Class? 

                                      BOOTH 
                        Dance class. Yuck. 

      Jamie shoots Vanessa a look.

                                       VANESSA 
                        Look, Jamie, I'm really glad you 
                        stopped by, but we've got to go.  

      Jamie understands where the hickey came from. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Sure. Yeah, I understand. Can't be 
                        late.  
                              (to Booth) 
                        Listen, Chuckles, you want to maybe 
                        get together, play some ball, maybe go 
                        do some hiking this weekend?  

                                      BOOTH 
                        As long as there's no dancing. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        No, no dancing. I ll see you Saturday, 
                        Moose. Here's your key. Listen, if I m 
                        not up, you come in and get me up, 
                        okay? Love-monster hug. 

      They hug and GROWL like MONSTERS.  

                                      BOOTH 
                        Love you, Daddy. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Love you, too. 
                              (to Vanessa) 
                        Sorry, Nessie.  

                                      VANESSA 
                        No sorries. 

                                      BOOTH 
                        Bye, Daddy. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Bye. 

      Jamie heads to the door. 

 
      INT. ROCK CLUB -- NIGHT 

      Jamie looks out of place as he enters the noisy club in search of 
      Wally. MUSIC BLASTS over the PA, but the stage is empty. Jamie searches 
      for the stage door. 

 
 


 9 
       INT. DRESSING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 

      Wally sits getting his hairs spiked by a tall, slender woman, SUE, when 
      Jamie enters. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Hey. 

      Wally gives Jamie a hearty handshake. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Jamie, you made it! Did you get that 
                        table up front? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Yeah. 

      The YOUNGER BAND MEMBERS are all either tuning up or tooting up. The 
      room is littered with GIRLFRIENDS, GROUPIES, ROADIES, and HANGERS ON. 
      The SINGER offers Jamie a toot. 

                                      BASS PLAYER 
                        Hey, man, you want some vitamin C? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        No, thanks. I'm on a diet. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Help you lose weight. Hey, Jamie, do 
                        that thing with the quarter. Watch 
                        this, everybody. It s great.  

                                      JAMIE 
                        No. 

      Jamie is saved by the bell as the stage door opens and the CLUB MANAGER 
      ENTERS, pointing at his watch. 

                                      CLUB MANAGER 
                        Okay, boys, let s go. 

                                      WALLY (CONT'D) 
                        Shit. Showtime. 
                                (shouting to the band) 
                        Okay, everybody, remember, we are the 
                        chosen ones, the gods of rock  n roll! 

 
      INT. ROCK CLUB -- NIGHT -- STAGE 

      The Spotlight illuminates off Wally's red mohawk, as he cues the first 
      GRUNGE METAL number with a crashing chord.

                                       SINGER (SINGING) 
                      I feel alive 
                      I feel I could die 

      Jamie rests his elbows on the tiny table, sneaking his fingers into his 
      ears. We now hear the way Jamie hears, the sound slightly muffled. 

                                      SINGER (SINGING CONT D) 
                      I feel I could curse out loud in a 
                        church 
                        No more time 
                        Too broken by what you say hurts 
                      I know& 

      Sue sits in front of him. Jamie removes his fingers from his ears. The 
      music is again unbearably loud. 

                                      SINGER (SINGING CONT D) 
                        I m jaded& 

                                      SUE 
                        So do that thing with the quarter. 

      They have to shout to one another to be heard. Embarrassed, he 
      sputters, trying not to look at her cleavage. She's way out of his 
      league. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Oh, no ,that s& It's just a magic 
                        trick. It s& you know, it s silly. 

                                      SUE 
                        Come on. I want to see it. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        All right. 

      Something starts to happen. The crashing rock  n  roll, Sue s voice, 
      the ambient sound is all sucked away into a black velvet vacuum. The 
      silence is horrifying. 

      But the sound doesn't just evaporate. It soon gives way to ROMANTIC 
      CLASSICAL MUSIC, champagne and candles stuff. 

      Sue speaks, her face close, but all we can hear is the CLASSICAL MUSIC, 
    a pop, and the sound of champagne pouring. 

      Jamie feels a touch of panic. He cries out like a deaf man over the 
      rock  n  roll, unable to even hear himself. He shouts soundlessly to 
      her, and Sue, getting a little freaked out, leaves. 

      Jamie's alone, near panic, when suddenly the soft velvet is overwhelmed 
      by Wally's wall of music.

                                       SINGER (SINGING) 
                        Twisted people, well, I m no angel 
                        Serpentine 
                        Serpentine 
                          Serpentine& 

      Jamie looks around, his fingers in his ears again. Everywhere else life 
      is normal, but it takes a moment for Jamie's terror to pass. 

 
      EXT. HIGHWAY -- NIGHT 

      An aging convertible careens down the empty late-night highway, Wally s 
      guitar case reaching out of the backseat. 

                                      JAMIE (V/O) 
                        You really kicked ass tonight. 

 
      INT./EXT. WALLY'S CAR -- NIGHT 

      Jamie is driving, due to Wally's obvious flirtation with illegal 
      substances.  

                                      WALLY 
                        We were pretty fucking awesome, 
                        weren't we? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Next thing you know it's MTV, babes in 
                        bikinis, low-boy leather pants with 
                        your buns hanging out. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Anna says I've got cute buns. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I never said you didn't. 

      They share a laugh. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT D) 
                        What was with the fake mohawk? 

                                      WALLY 
                        Oh.. 
                              (pats his head) 
                        Covers my hair transplant scar. What 
                        the hell? 

      They laugh again. 

      The convertible ZOOMS along the highway.  

      Jamie and Wally are both lost in separate thoughts. 

 12 
       Jamie's POV THROUGH the WINDSHIELD of a car approaching. 

      Something is happening to Jamie's vision. The lines on the highway 
      light up, then the road changes to the view of an unfamiliar spot. 
      Quickly the road changes back. 

      Jamie sits back, disturbed by the hallucination. 

      The hallucination returns, clearer than before. An unfamiliar city 
      street looms before him. 

      Jamie if flipping between reality and the hallucination. TWO OLDER 
      WOMEN move along a charming, old-fashioned cobblestone road. The pass a 
      quaint old CLOCK that reads 11:25, two hours earlier than it is in the 
      sedan. City buildings reach high into the skyline over the trees that 
      line the road. 

                                      JAMIE  
                        Oh shit... 

      The car veers over the yellow line. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT D) 
                        Wally! 

      Wally rouses. 

                                      WALLY 
                          What's&what s the matter? 

      Jamie jerks the wheel, trying to maintain control, but flying blind. 
      The car SCREECHES crazily. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I can't see. 

                                      WALLY 
                        What? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I can't see. 

      The car straddles the middle two lanes, weaving crazily. 

                                      WALLY 
                        What are you doing? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I can't see. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Jamie&wha&what are you doing? 

      Jamie and Wally are being thrown about the car.  


 13 
                                       WALLY (CONT D) 
                        What the fuck are you talking about  

                                      JAMIE 
                        Take the fucking wheel! 

                                      WALLY 
                        What the fuck? 

      Wally reaches frantically for the wheel. 

    A huge TRUCK looms toward them from the rise ahead. It BLASTS its HORN. 

      Wally lunges across Jamie, grabbing the wheel just as Jamie jams and 
      locks the brakes sending them into an insane skid. Tires screeching, 
      the car races across the blacktop. 

      Jamie and Wally scream, frantic, trying to steer, their hands fighting 
      at the wheel. 

      The truck barely misses Wally's car, which goes into a wild SKID, 
      coming to a rest on the side of the road. 

      Everything goes quiet, as the truck's HORN fades into the distance. 
      Wally's guitar case has jammed between the front seats, hiding Wally 
      from Jamie. 

      Jamie's eyes open and he realizes what has just happened. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Wally. Wally, you okay? 

      Whimpering comes from behind the case. Jamie pulls the case aside and 
      Wally rises up, his face in a shit-eating grin. He's laughing like he 
      just got off a great roller coaster. 

                                      WALLY 
                        That was fucking great. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT -- JAMIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 

      It is very dark. The only illumination is the light from the clock 
      radio in a soft wash over Jamie's sleeping face. His eyes are 
      fluttering as he dreams. The clock reads 2:47. 

      Suddenly a MAN'S FACE flashes into the darkness as he lights his 
      cigarette lighter.  

      Jamie s eyes jolt open. 

      Then, as the FLAME is extinguished, the face goes with it into the 
      blackness. 



 14 
       Jamie sits up and stares into the pitch darkness of the bedroom, his 
      pupils dilated in the blackness, his heart pounding. 

      There is only dead, dark silence. Nothing is there, but still he 
      doesn't trust his own senses.  

      He switches on a lamp and climbs out of his bed, his heart pounding. He 
      picks up the lamp and looks around the room. 

                                      JAMIE  
                        Who's there? 

      Jamie stands alone in the room, his heart in his throat. Leading with 
      the lamp, he moves to the closet, which is ajar.  

      He reaches for the closet door, fear choking him as he wrenches it 
      open. 

      In the backwash, a coat tumbles out of the closet toward Jamie, scaring 
      the shit out of him. He shouts. 

      He sets the lamp back in place. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT   CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS 

      Jamie moves down the hallway, tension building as he moves through 
      shadows. At the kitchen, he fumbles on the light switch. Nothing is 
      there. He stands alert for a moment.  

      Distant MUSIC filters through the apartment. 

      Jamie heads back down the corridor. He stops at the living room and 
      flicks on the light. Nothing. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT   LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 

      Jamie enters the living room. It s empty. 

      It had to be a dream. After standing in the middle of the empty room 
      for a moment, he turns off the lights, and heads back to the bedroom. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT   CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS 

      Jamie no sooner steps into the hallway when the Man appears in front of 
      him. His expression is startlingly benign, even smiling, as he looks 
      right into the camera and speaks. 

                                      MAN 
                        Did I wake you? 



 15 
       Jamie jumps and lunges for the hall light. He flicks it on, but the man 
      is gone. All Jamie can do is stand there wondering if he is starting to 
      lose his mind. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT   BEDROOM -- MORNING 

      The clock radio suddenly blasts on and Jamie jolts awake.  

      He fumbles for the radio, slapping it off. A baseball bat lies on the 
      floor next to him. 

 
      INT. SUPERMARKET -- DAY 

      Jamie moves through the organic produce section, his cart filled with 
      whole-grain breads, vegetables, and other healthy foods and vitamins. 

      ELAINE, an attractive woman beside Jamie fills her cart with the same 
      kind of wholesome food. She notices him. 

                                      WOMAN (V/O) 
                        We need a clean up in aisle three. 
                        Clean up in aisle three. 

      Other shoppers are mostly heavy set and pushing huge carts laden with 
      junk food. 

      ELAINE speaks and startles Jamie. 

                                      ELAINE 
                      I don't know how they can do it, 
                        either. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        What's that? 

                                      ELAINE 
                        Well, I mean, it is so easy to get 
                        food that's good for you. It even 
                        tastes better. But they raise their 
                        kids on Choco-Treats and Frosted Pops, 
                        so that's what they like. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Right. Yeah, it s sausage and eggs and 
                        hash browns for breakfast, chili dogs 
                        and cheeseburgers, battered fries for 
                        lunch, and then deep-fried chicken 
                        fingers and macaroni and cheese for 
                        dinner, with a big bowl of ice cream. 

      She flashes a sweet, disarming smile. This is fun. 



 16 
                                       ELAINE 
                        You know what else is just terrible? 
                        Mile-high chocolate cake. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Ooh, and double-cheese pizza with 
                        pepperoni and sausage. Yuck. 

      They're getting into it now, torturing each other with their favorite 
      garbage foods. 

                                      ELAINE 
                        And double chocolate chunk cookies, 
                        still warm so the chocolate gets all 
                        over your fingers. Just awful. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Yeah. 

      Jamie pauses for a moment and observes her shapely figure. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT D) 
                        So how long have you been dieting... 
                        and for God's sake, why? 

                                      ELAINE 
                        96 days. Hypoglycemia. I m paying for 
                        too many years of double desserts. How 
                        about you? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Um, 47 days.  
                                (beat) 
                        Vanity. There. I've said it aloud. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        So you want to celebrate? 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT   DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 

      PAN across a litter of junk food wrappers, soda cans, chocolates, pizza 
      remains, an empty wine bottle. There are two big bowls of ice cream in 
      front of them. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        So how do you feel? How's your 
                          hypoglycemia? 

                                      ELAINE 
                      I feel great. You cured me. 

      Jamie looks at her, realizing he feels better than he's felt in a long 
      time. 

 17 
                                       JAMIE 
                        No, I think you cured me. 

      They take a beat to look into one another's eyes. 

    A soft blush passes between them before he finally reaches over and 
      kisses her gently on the lips. 

      She indicates food in his teeth, and when he moves his hand to clean 
      it, she sits back abruptly. 

                                      ELAINE  
                        Are you married? 

      The question startles him, coming from nowhere. 

                                      ELAINE (CONT'D) 
                        The white circle on your ring finger. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        No, I was, but the divorce was final a 
                        few months ago. 

      She takes his hand. 

                                      ELAINE 
                        I'm sorry. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        It's okay. Seven years of a monogamous 
                          relationship. At least I'm safe. 

                                      ELAINE 
                              (coy) 
                        Really? For what? 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT   BEDROOM -- NIGHT 

      Jamie and Elaine make love in the tangled sheets. It is gentle, but 
      sweaty, needy, yet intimate and sweet. As it ends, Jamie smiles, 
      holding her in his arms. 

                                      ELAINE  
                        It's easy to be with you. 

      But the afterglow is short-lived. Jamie is in sudden PAIN. He gasps and 
      grimaces, clutching his stomach. 

                                      ELAINE (CONT'D) 
                        What? What is it? 

      He winces as another pain hits him like a kick in the balls. 


 18 
                                       ELAINE 
                        Sharp pains? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I think I ll be okay in a minute. 

      He winces in pain again. 

                                      ELAINE 
                        Okay, hold on. 

      She gets up, and as he clutches his stomach, she returns with water and 
    a bottle of menstrual cramp medication. 

                                      ELAINE (CONT'D) 
                        See if this helps. 

      He downs the pills, and she caresses his forehead, wiping sweat from 
      his brow. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Guess that's what I get for pigging 
                        out. 

                                      ELAINE 
                        Let's go to sleep. 

      She curls up beside him. He starts breathing easier. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Oh, this is weird. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT   BEDROOM -- MORNING 

      Jamie squirms, then SNEEZES awake. His eyes open, and he does a double 
      take, looking around the room with wide eyes. 

 
      INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 

      Jamie lies alone on a different bed in a different room, naked under 
      the sheets. The room is shadowed with curtains that are partly open, 
      revealing an unfamiliar cityscape. 

      The room reminds us of a jungle, with sculptures, paintings, animal 
      figures hiding in the hard-to-pierce shadows. But there is something 
      feminine and mysterious about the room. 

      The clock-radio reads 7:15. 

                                      VOICE (O/S) 
                        You awake, Cat? 


 19 
       O/S the SHOWER is running. A bouquet of roses sits on a nearby table. 

      Jamie's swings to face the doorway leading into the adjoining bathroom, 
      as the shower is turned off. 

      RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      He is sitting upright in his own bed, looking straight ahead blindly. 
      He s disoriented, frightened. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        It's happening... 

      Elaine groggily comes awake next to him. 

                                      ELAINE 
                        What s happening? 

      RESUME OTHER BEDROOM -- JAMIE'S POV 

    A man comes out of the bathroom, a towel around his waist. He is well-
      built, tattooed, and good-looking. He smiles into the camera. It's the 
      INTRUDER. 

                                      MAN 
                        How can anybody look so good so early? 

      The Man approaches the CAMERA, reaching out his hands to us. He grabs 
      Jamie s hand, but it appears to be a woman s hand with a gold bracelet. 

      RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      Jamie watches the scene, alarmed. 

      RESUME OTHER BEDROOM -- JAMIE'S POV 

      The Man sucks Jamie s finger seductively, then leans in for a kiss.

                        God, you re so fucking beautiful. 

      The man leans down below the frame line, kissing and licking amorously. 
      The VIEW drifts up to the CEILING.

       RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      Jamie s body is thrown back against the bed. Elaine, frightened, 
      reaches out to him, afraid to touch him. 

                                      ELAINE 
                        Jamie, what is it? 

      Jamie's hands claws grip the sides of the bed. 

                                      ELAINE (CONT'D) 
                        What's wrong? 

      He JERKS, as if being PENETRATED, his BODY invaded. 

      RESUME OTHER BEDROOM -- JAMIE'S POV 

      The Man is atop him, thrusting. 

      RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      He helplessly whimpers, BUCKING uncontrollably. Elaine's fear is 
      becoming disgust. 

                                      ELAINE 
                        Jamie, stop it. Please&please, stop. 

      But he can't. He can't even HEAR her. 

      RESUME OTHER BEDROOM -- JAMIE'S POV 

      Their lovemaking grows more intense, overwhelming. 

      RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      Elaine, at a loss for what to do, tries to hold Jamie down with her 
      hands on his chest. 

                                      ELAINE 
                        Stop it, okay? Stop it! This isn t 
                        funny. 

      Jamie continues, oblivious to her pleading. 

                                      ELAINE (CONT D) 
                        Jamie, you re scaring me. Stop it.

      Elaine looks at Jamie, panicking. 

                                      ELAINE 
                              (frantic whispers) 
                        Jamie, there's somebody at the front 
                        door. There's somebody at the door. 

      He is oblivious to the real world around him. Elaine scrambles to get 
      dressed.

      Elaine turns to the door in horror as it opens and Vanessa and Booth 
      enter, smiling, ready to awaken Daddy. Booth is giggling excitedly. 

                                      BOOTH 
                        Rise and shine, Daddy. 

 22 
       Jamie BUCKS wildly as Elaine finishes getting dressed. The smiles on 
      Booth's and Vanessa's faces drop at the sight of her. Elaine doesn't 
      know what she's gotten herself into.  

                                      ELAINE 
                        Oh, my God.

                        Hey, your family s here. 

      Booth thinks there's something wrong with his Daddy, and shouts at him. 
      Jamie is in the throes of bliss.

      of the room. 

                                      ELAINE 
                      I didn't do anything. 

                                      VANESSA 
                        Goddamn you, Jamie. 

      Jamie comes out of the spell as his ex-wife and son storm out. He is 
      weak and shaking, horrified to have transposed so nakedly in front of 
      Elaine.  

                                      JAMIE 
                              (a whisper to himself) 
                        It's a woman... 

      Furious, Elaine gathers her stuff and is gone with a sob. 

      Jamie looks at her with total embarrassment.

      But she s gone. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- DAY 

      His face is gaunt with depression as he shaves in front of the mirror. 
      He suddenly sneezes. The razor slips making a shallow cut on his face 
      that draws blood, but he is oblivious.  

      He stares transfixed into the mirror as his body relaxes. He stands 
      taller, a million miles away, transposing. 

      His face flushes, and he smiles. His skin prickles and the gentle, 
      loving music plays. This time, it feels wonderful. 

      JAMIE/WOMAN'S POV -- THE WOMAN'S BEDROOM -- DAY 

      She sits at her vanity before a clever little wooden box. Her hands 
      lovingly place items in the box-- a zoo of tiny wooden animals and a 
      chocolate truffle. 

      Jamie/Woman turns to a note that reads  I love you.  He picks up a pen 
      and puts it to the paper. 

      RESUME JAMIE'S BATHROOM 

      Jamie stares forward into the mirror.

      Jamie stares forward into the mirror. He smiles.

                        Those three words were suddenly so 
                        potent and meaningful to me. 

 
      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM   NIGHT 

      Close on Jamie.

                                       JAMIE 
                        Up until then, I didn't realize that 
                        you could feel with your heart and 
                        your guts. It felt so new and deep and 
                        good.  
                                (beat) 
                        Until that moment, I didn t realize 
                        how shallow my life had been, and 
                        it... well, humiliated me. 

      INT. COUGAR CULINARY LABORATORIES -- DAY 

      Lunchtime. Jamie sits alone at his workstation eating a turkey wrap and 
      staring into the calm aquarium in front of him.  

                                      JAMIE (V/O) 
                        It felt like... like growing up. 

      Jamie s face is reflected in the glass. He stares at it, hypnotized by 
      the fishes' slow-motion movements. 

      He watches without seeing, his mind elsewhere, and he begins to 
      transpose. 

 
      INT. A BATHROOM   CONTINUOUS -- JAMIE'S/WOMAN'S POV 

      The Woman's hand turns off the water in the sink. She looks up at the 
      mirror, and for a split-second, we catch a glimpse of an absolutely 
      gorgeous woman, CATHERINE DUPRES, reflected in the mirror from the 
      waist up. The lightning flash image is indelibly etched in our sight as 
      it whooshes past. 

      She has large brown eyes, white, almost porcelain skin, shoulder length 
      blonde hair, and is just breathtaking. 

      But as soon as she flashes by, the frame begins to shift again. 

      RESUME COUGAR CULINARY LABORATORIES 

      Jamie gasps at the sight of her. He reaches out for the aquarium. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        No! Please, don't go. 

      He reaches frantically for her, smashing his hand against his 
      reflection, upsetting the fish. 

      REVEAL Wally watching him from across the lab. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Are you okay? 

      Jamie looks around with surprise and embarrassment. 

 25 
  
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT -- DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 

      There are candles placed strategically about the room. Romantic 
      classical music plays in the BG. A dozen roses sit in a vase on the 
      table. Jamie, stuffy from the roses, lights the last candle and pops 
      the cork on a bottle of champagne. He pours two glasses. 

      Jamie reaches for a truffle. He takes a bite. 

      Jamie settles back into the dining room chair, trying with all his 
      might to summon up the Woman. So far, nothing is happening. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Come back to me. 

      The music grows soothing, hypnotic. 

      Jamie sits quiet, serene, willing her back. Move in on him. It's never 
      going to happen. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT -- DINING ROOM -- LATER 

      Jamie s eyes blink open, as if from sleep. 

 
      INT. WOMAN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT 

      Jamie stands in the Woman's bathroom. He stands in front of the full-
      length mirror. 

      It is an artful room, with lots of tile. It s a strange but melodious 
      cross between Art Deco and the jungles of Rousseau. 

      Jamie s POV of the mirror shows the Woman  standing before it, nude. 
      She is taking inventory of her appearance. It is a very intimate, 
      private moment.  

      RESUME JAMIE'S DINING ROOM 

      Jamie is in two places at once, still sitting in his dining room, his 
      eyes wide. We know at once that he is transposing again. His BREATH 
      deepens. 

      RESUME THE WOMAN'S BATHROOM 

      She pulls her hair back and tries various ways of framing her face.

      Jamie's eyes remain unblinking, his breathing comes harder.

      The Woman sits on the edge of the tub as she aims the pulsing water 
      between her spread legs.

      Jamie s breathing grows ragged. 

      RESUME THE WOMAN'S BATHROOM 

      The Woman draws closer to climax. 

      RESUME JAMIE'S DINING ROOM 

      Jamie moves with the woman, matching her rhythm, and making sounds of 
      his own.  

      He takes deep breaths, until the waves of climax crash over him. It is 
      powerful, draining, and his body slumps against the chair. 

      His eyes open and he returns to his lonely little world out of breath 
      and having experienced his first female orgasm. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Jesus. 

 
 

 27 
       INT. COUGAR CULINARY LABORATORIES -- DAY 

      Jamie enters and looks at Wally, needing to talk with someone about the 
      strange events that are happening to him. Hesitant at first, he decides 
      to just go ahead and tell. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Wally, something really weird is 
                        happening to me. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Yeah? Good weird or bad weird? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        You know these... these spells I've 
                        been having? 

                                      WALLY 
                        Yeah. Have they gotten worse? 

      Jamie looks at Wally, his mind working a mile a minute. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Well, it s... it s a woman. 

      Wally looks up at Jamie and smiles. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Excellent. Jamie, congratulations.

                        She's the most beautiful woman I've 
                        ever seen.

                        Oh, man& you got it bad. 

      Jamie decides to tell him. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        It's not what you think. It's like... 
                        it's like I'm receiving transmissions 
                        from somebody.

                        what she sees, I hear what she hears, 
                      I feel what she feels.

                        Wally, I'm serious. 

      Wally can see that. He brings it down a notch. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Okay& how do you know it's a woman? 

      Jamie blushes, embarrassed. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Last night, the woman, uh... she had 
                        sex...  

      Wally watches him. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT D) 
                        and I felt it. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Whoa. You felt her get fucked? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Wally, I'm not crazy. This is for 
                        real. 

      Wally looks at him like he's missing a cog. Jamie is sorry he said 
      anything.  

                                      JAMIE (CONT D) 
                        Never mind. Forget it. 

      Jamie walks away. Wally gets up after him. 

                                      WALLY  
                        Listen, the twins are visiting my 
                        folks, so Anna wanted me to invite you

                      I think maybe she needs me. 

      Jamie walks off. Wally doesn't know what to think. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 

      Jamie sits at the table, already far into the depths of transposition. 
      Champagne is uncorked. Classical music drifts through.  

      He stares blindly ahead, and grabs one of the candles, jamming its 
      burning tip against the white tablecloth. Jamie moves the candle with a 
      purpose, drawing with it. His hands work independently. His eyes are 
      blank and distant.

      The room is vast and open, filled with a slovenly collection of ART

      Jamie watches unblinkingly. 

      RESUME LOFT -- JAMIE'S POV 

      She slowly makes her way through the doorway into the dark, unfamiliar 
      room. There is a KING-SIZE BED further in.  

      The Man is in the bed with a beautiful, young GIRL. Both are nearly 
      undressed. The Man quickly sits up and his face relaxes into a smile. 

                                      MAN 
                        Look what I got for us.

                        Hi. 

      The Man quickly leans toward the CAMERA, taking The Woman's hand and 
      leading her to the bed.

                        Come on... get in with us. 

      The Man turns again toward the Girl, brushing the hair from her face.

                        Doesn't she have a beautiful face? 

      The Girl smiles, still embarrassed, but willing. He indicates the wall 
      next to the bed.

                        Look.

      Jamie jumps in shock. 

      RESUME LOFT -- JAMIE'S POV 

      The Man looks at the Woman, furious. 

                                      MAN 
                        You bitch! 

      He leaps from the bed, backhanding her, and the screen FLASHES WHITE as 
      he connects.  

      RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      Jamie collapses against the wall, his eyes wide, as the vision drifts 
      away, just at the most important part. His face is red, as if being 
      strangled.  

      RESUME LOFT -- JAMIE'S POV 

      The Man gets in the Woman s face angrily. 

                                      MAN 
                        Who do you think you are? 

      RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      Jamie gasps for breath. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Leave her alone! 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- LATER 

      The clock radio reads 5:05 a.m.. 

      Jamie is asleep, but not at rest. Suddenly, his eyes snap open as he 
      bolts from sleep. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        What?

       INT. LOFT -- NIGHT 

        Jamie's/Woman's POV. The Man is hovers over her. He lowers his naked 
      frame onto her body.  

      As he is about to enter her, her hand flashes into frame, gripping an 
      enormous, glinting KNIFE. 

      RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      Jamie watches. 

      RESUME LOFT -- JAMIE'S POV 

      The Woman brings the BLADE up and into his BELLY. 

      RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      Jamie s hands are clenched in a single, white-knuckled fist, aping the 
      Woman's. 

      RESUME LOFT -- JAMIE'S POV 

      The Woman brutally plunges the knife deeper into his horrified, 
      squirming body. 

      RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      Jamie gulps for breath in the throes of the vision, feeling her sick 
      fury. 

      RESUME LOFT -- JAMIE'S POV 

      She shoves it deeper. It is a shocking attack of sadistic fury. Blood 
      runs down the blade. The Man jerks, fading. 

      RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      Jamie continues aping the attack. 

      RESUME LOFT -- JAMIE'S POV 

      The Woman continues to pull the blade up his body, slicing his chest in 
      two.

      Jamie continues. 

      RESUME LOFT -- JAMIE'S POV 

      The Man falls forward. 


 34 
       RESUME JAMIE'S BEDROOM 

      Jamie releases the imagined knife. He comes out of it, shaken, sick 
      with emotion, unable to bear the brutality of the murder. Awash with 
      revulsion, he suddenly lurches over the side of the bed and VOMITS. 

 
      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT 

      Jamie looks up into the camera, on the edge of hysteria. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I could feel his blood running all 
                        down my arms, all hot and sticky. I 
                        just felt so... sick and filthy and... 
                      I don't know, depraved, like a 
                        murderer. I felt so empty and sick and 
                        scared inside. I just didn't know how 
                        to feel anymore. 
                                (beat) 
                        And then all the visions just stopped 
                        dead. Everything went dead. 

 
      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT 

      Jamie is at the kitchen table reading and drinking wheat grass juice. 
      The TV on the counter is gargling with anonymous programming and Jamie 
      couldn't be less interested.  

                                      JAMIE (V/O) 
                      I was in love with her... but this had 
                        me all fucked up. 

      The program changes and grabs Jamie s attention. 

      Jamie s POV of the TV. A BLACK CAR roars across the road. It pulls into 
    a parking stall. 

      It hits Jamie like a ton of bricks.  

      FLASHBACK -- THE BLACK CAR IN THE PARK 

      The Woman approaches the same kind of black car. 

      RESUME JAMIE'S KITCHEN 

      The car and its plate fills the TV screen-- IOWA X8N 739. Jamie is 
      mesmerized.

      INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT -- DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 

      Jamie works away on his laptop. A MAP of the US fills its screen. 

      Deep in excited concentration, Jamie pores over SITES of LICENSE 
      PLATES, trying to match up the color patterns from his vision. It seems 
      like most states have blue lettering on a white background. 

      FLASHBACK -- THE WOMAN'S CITY'S SKYLINE 

      The sight as she left the park with the mountains and bay in BG.

                        It s the coast. 

      Jamie turns back to the computer. He crosses off unlikely candidates   
      Maine.

                        Canada& Canada. 

      He brings up British Columbia. The plate matches. He calls up a picture 
      site, viewing IMAGES of Vancouver. They are the same images he saw 
      through the Woman's eyes   the sails, the clock. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT D) 
                        That s it. 

      He sits back, sighing deeply. 

                                        DETECTIVE (V/O) 
                        You set out to Vancouver because of a 
                        piece of a license plate?  

 
      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 

      Close on Jamie. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I just knew that I had to find her. 

                                        DETECTIVE 
                        Well, what did you expect to do once 
                        you found her? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I don't know. I loved her.

                        Maybe it was just a dream we shared. 
                        maybe it was self-defense. I don't 
                        know, but I hoped so. 

 
      EXT. VANCOUVER STREET -- DAY 

      Jamie moves among the throngs of people amidst the morning bustle. 

 37 
     A WHISTLE BLOWS as Jamie passes the GASTOWN STEAM CLOCK, the clock he 
      saw in his vision on the highway with Wally. 

      Jamie turns to get a better look at the clock and SLAMS right into a 
      MAN reading his newspaper, knocking him to the sidewalk.  

                                      JAMIE 
                        Sorry.  

      Jamie apologizes, but is suddenly startled by the man's newspaper in 
      front of him. He picks it up and reads the headline. 

      On the front page is a PHOTO and HEADLINE that jolts our attention. It 
      is the Man from the visions in the photo. The headline reads, "Local 
      artist found dead in studio." 

      The Man he knocked to the ground grabs the paper back roughly. 

                                      MAN 
                        Want to buy your own? 

      Jamie reaches for a paper. 

 
      EXT. VANCOUVER -- GASTOWN STREET -- DAY 

      Jamie searches for an address. He stops. Bells ring. Is he transposing 
      again? He waits a moment, surprised not to be transposing. But he 
      smells something. He looks around, spotting something across the 
      street.  

      In the middle of a block of shops is an ELEGANT LITTLE SHOP with an 
      old-fashioned SIGN with a distinctive logo over the door, "Plaisirs de 
      Chocolat". He is drawn irresistibly to the store. 

 
      EXT. VANCOUVER -- GASTOWN INDUSTRIAL STREET -- DAY 

      Jamie moves down the sidewalk carrying an expensive box of CHOCOLATES, 
      searching again for the address. 

      He steps out in front of the LOFT where the Man, DENNISON HOOPER, was 
      found dead. He checks it against the newspaper photo. 

      Jamie tries the door. It creaks open and he looks up the crumbling, 
      shadowy stairway.  

 
      INT. LOFT STAIRWAY   DAY 

      Jamie makes his way up. He KNOCKS on the heavy door, but there is no 
      sound. He looks at the POLICE SEAL across the door. 

 
 

 38 
       INT. LOFT   MOMENTS LATER 

      Jamie kicks the door open. He stands still in the silence of the empty 
      loft. 

      Jamie ENTERS. He spots a large PHOTO that holds his attention-- a B&W 
        photographic PORTRAIT of the Man and the Woman, standing intimately 
      close, nearly naked.  

      He places his things down and turns to another canvas titled 
         Catherine . In it, the Woman lies bound in ropes in a pool of her own 
      blood. Jamie reacts. 

      Jamie moves to the row of crusted windows. He looks across to the 
      building on the other side of the street below, noticing the Woman s 
      black car parked out front. 

      The Woman looks up from the driver's seat. It is Catherine. 

      Jamie races out of the loft, grabbing the chocolates, but forgetting 
      the newspaper. 

 
      EXT. VANCOUVER -- STREET IN FRONT OF LOFT   MOMENTS LATER 

      Catherine peels around the corner just as Jamie comes stumbling 
      outside. 

      He sees the license plate. It reads SQM 329. 

      Jamie stares at her dust, repeating the license number to himself. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        SQM 329. SQM 329. 

 
      EXT. VANCOUVER -- RESIDENTIAL STREET -- NIGHT 

      JAMIE walks up the unfamiliar street, stopping in front of a LUXURY 
      CONDOMINIUM BUILDING. He carries the box of chocolates under his arm.  

 
      EXT. CATHERINE'S CONDO BUILDING -- FRONT DOOR -- CONTINUOUS 

      As Jamie checks the list of residents, one of them comes out the door. 
      Seeing his chance, Jamie enters. 

 
      INT. CATHERINE'S CONDO BUILDING   CORRIDOR   MOMENTS LATER 

      Jamie finds her door and takes a deep nervous breath. He KNOCKS lightly 
      on the door. No one answers. He knocks again.  



 39 
                                         CATHERINE (O/S) 
                        Just a minute. 

      The door opens. 

      Catherine appears in a robe without make-up, her hair wet, a disarming 
      smile on her face. She is achingly beautiful. 

                                        CATHERINE (CONT'D) 
                        Sorry, I was in the shower. 

      Jamie can't speak. 

                                        CATHERINE (CONT'D) 
                        Yes? 

      He looks at her. He has seen what is under that robe.  

                                      JAMIE 
                        Catherine Dupres? 

      She looks at Jamie without a trace of recognition. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Yes? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Do you know me? 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Have we met? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Sorry. No, I guess not. I have a 
                        delivery for you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Really? What is it? 

      He smiles and holds up the box for her. 

      An icy look crosses her face as she sees the logo. She looks at Jamie, 
      icicles shooting from her eyes. The DOOR SLAMS furiously in his face. 

 
      EXT. CATHERINE'S CONDO BUILDING -- NIGHT 

      Jamie storms out of the building. He slams down the chocolates. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Asshole. It just reminds her of him. 

      Jamie moves down the street and into the night. 


 40 
  
      EXT. VANCOUVER -- STANLEY PARK -- DAY 

    A beautiful, cold, crisp morning. Catherine walks along the shore 
      alone. A JOGGER goes through his paces around the park. 

      Jamie follows, keeping his distance. Catherine turns and disappear into 
      the greenery. Jamie is nervous, having lost sight of her. He slows 
      down, searching for her. 

      He stops at the water fountain. She is nowhere to be seen. He bends to 
      take a drink. 

      Catherine steps in front of him, angry. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Why are you following me? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        I'm not following you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Do you think I'm an imbecile? 

      He just shakes his head, rather than try to answer her. 

                                        CATHERINE (CONT'D) 
                        What do you want? 

      She glares unflinching into his eyes. He can't control what comes out 
      of his mouth. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I think you're the most beautiful 
                        woman I've ever seen. 

      That throws her off-balance for a moment, though she doesn't believe 
      him. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Tell me why you brought me those 
                          chocolates. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I thought you'd like them... 
                                (beat) 
                        And I... I needed to meet you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        How do you know me? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I saw you sketching at the zoo, a 
                        cougar. I... I'm a fan. I really like 
                        your work.  

 41 
                                         CATHERINE 
                        Then why didn't you just come up and 
                        say hello? Why are you following me? I 
                        could call a policeman and have you 
                        thrown in jail. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I don't know. I'm really sorry. I was 
                        stupid. I just& I had to meet you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Well... we've met. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Yes. 

      She turns to leave. Jamie follows her. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                      I like your painting very much. I 
                        think you're very talented. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                                (sarcastic) 
                        Thank you for telling me that. 

      Jamie can't bear that it all might end here at the Stanley Park water 
      fountain so he continues. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Look, I'm not one of those creeps that 
                        follows beautiful women around and 
                        drives them crazy. I'm not a stalker. 
                              (gently, persuasively) 
                      I know I made a mistake. I'm really 
                        very, very sorry. I realize I make a 
                        lousy first impression. Could I just 
                        talk with you?  

      When she doesn't say anything immediately, he takes it as encouragement 
      and continues before she can decline. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Lunch, someplace nice. Your choice. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        I m glad you like my work, but I don't 
                        think it would be a good idea. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        No, please. We need to talk. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        No, you need to talk. I don't.

                                       JAMIE 
                        Listen, I've come a very long way to 
                        find you. Just lunch. A public place. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        My life is complicated enough right 
                        now. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I know. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What do you know? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I mean, everybody's life is 
                        complicated. Mine too. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Why me? Why don't you go stalk some 
                        movie star somewhere? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I know how special you are. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        You don't know anything about me. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Yes, I do. 
                                (covering) 
                      I know you wish I'd leave you alone. 

      She sighs and almost smiles. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Look, I know how you feel, and I don't 
                        blame you at all, and I promise I'll 
                        leave you alone and never bother you 
                        again if that's what you want. Just 
                        let me take you to lunch first. Just 
                        once. 

      She nods. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        You're right about one thing. 
                              (he brightens) 
                        You make a terrible first impression. 

      They smile. 

 
 


 43 
       EXT. VANCOUVER -- STANLEY PARK CAFE -- DAY 

      Jamie and Catherine shares sandwiches under an umbrella in the park. It 
      is awkward and somewhat formal between them. She feels uncomfortable as 
      she looks at him. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                                (wary) 
                        Are you just going to keep staring at 
                        me? Is that why you're following me 
                        around? 

      He doesn't know how to start. Finally, he looks up at her. This is it. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I have to talk to you about something. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I have to tell you the reason& why I 
                        love you. 

      She scowls. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I can't say it again. 
                                (beat) 
                      I know you better than you think. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        How long have you been spying on me? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        It's not what you re thinking. Please, 
                        don't be afraid of me. 

                                        CATHERINE  
                        I'm not afraid of you. 

      Jamie isn't quite sure how to start. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Sometimes... I'm inside you. 

      She stands to leave. Jamie grabs her hand. He takes control, stronger, 
      knowing this is the last chance.  



 44 
                                       JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        No, please. Listen to me. I'm not 
                        crazy. I'm not a pervert. I'm on your 
                        side.  

      Catherine takes her seat. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Sometimes I can feel what you feel. I 
                        can smell what you re smelling. I can 
                        even see what you see. I can't control 
                        it. It&it just happens. 

      She looks at him like he's crazy, but he doesn t stop. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                      I know I sound like a lunatic, but 
                        it's true. It started when I tasted 
                        the chocolate, and I thought it was a 
                        dream, but then the park with your 
                        paintings...  

      She is silent. She doesn't run away, maybe because she senses that it's 
      true. She knows what he must know. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        For some reason, I got to know you 
                        better than anybody knows you. 
                        Somehow, we're psychically linked, and 
                      I was hoping that maybe& you could 
                        feel me. 

      They look at one another for a long beat, both minds racing.  

                                        CATHERINE 
                        I'd like to go home now.  

      Jamie is crushed. 

 
      EXT. VANCOUVER -- RESIDENTIAL STREET -- DAY 

      The sun is going down as they walk up the street in awkward silence. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        I'd really rather be alone right now. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Please, just& please let me walk you 
                        to your door. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                              (sharp) 
                        Just leave me alone. 

 45 
       It's over. They look at each other, a long silent beat, and Jamie gives 
      up. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Okay.  
                                (beat) 
                        I'm sorry. I understand. 

      Jamie steps around the corner of a building, spotting something. 

      He quickly turns and roughly throws Catherine against the wall. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Shh. Shh. Shh. 

      Jamie peers around the corner of the building. In front of her condo 
      sits an unmarked POLICE CAR. TWO DETECTIVES sit in the car waiting. 

      She struggles as he holds her against the wall, his hand over her 
      mouth. She BITES him, but he won't let go. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Quiet. Quiet. Those are cops. You 
                        can t go home now. 

      Catherine s eyes are wide with fear and distrust. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        You have to trust me. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What do you know about me? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I know you had to do it. Let me help 
                        you. 

      Jamie looks back at the police car. 

                                        DETECTIVE (V/O) 
                        Out of millions of people, why you? 

 
      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT 

      Jamie looks up at the Detective. 








 46 
                                       JAMIE 
                        You think I don't spend every minute 
                        thinking about that? At first, I 
                        thought it was the chemicals at work. 
                        Or maybe it was her art that brought 
                        us together.  
                                (beat) 
                        Or maybe it's just that I was so empty 
                        and she was so full. 

 
      EXT. VANCOUVER -- STANLEY PARK -- DAY 

      Jamie sits next to Catherine on a bench facing out into the water. She 
      faces the water, away from him. She still doesn't trust him.  

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What do you want from me?  
                                (turns to him) 
                        Money? 
                                (beat) 
                        Sex? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Everything I've told you... everything 
                      I will ever tell you is the truth. 
                        I'll never lie to you. I want to help 
                        you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Even knowing what I've done? 

      He looks her in they eye, unable to answer, remembering the nausea, the 
      guilt, the pain, and her fury. 

      There is a TRANSITION in her. She lets down the wall, and we see how 
      truly vulnerable she is. Slowly, her eyes begin to brim. She looks up 
      into his eyes. 

                                        CATHERINE (CONT'D) 
                        I'm scared... 

      Jamie reaches out to put an arm around her and she allows him to touch 
      her. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I won't let anything happen to you. 

      She looks up into his eyes, reading him. Is trust dawning? She reaches 
      up and gently, hesitantly, traces his face with her fingertips, each 
      contact an electrical charge.  

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Will you take me home? 

 47 
                                       JAMIE 
                        Do you trust me? 

                                        CATHERINE 
                      I have to. 

      He looks at her a long beat. 

 
      EXT. CATHERINE'S CONDO BUILDING -- NIGHT 

      Jamie looks around, then turns to nod at Catherine. The coast is clear. 
      She steps out of the bushes and they move to the building together. 
      Catherine opens the door. 

      They park at the corner, just in case, and he leads a nervous Catherine 
      up to her house. 

 
      INT. CATHERINE'S CONDO BUILDING   CORRIDOR   MOMENTS LATER 

      She leads the way inside. She opens her door and enters. Jamie stands 
      at the doorway, watching her, his heart racing. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Come on in. 

 
      INT. CATHERINE'S CONDO -- LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 

      The large room is remarkable. The walls are Rousseau-like murals of 
      animals in the jungle. The furnishings are also of the jungle. Jars of 
      paintbrushes, easels, and paints are all over. 

      Seeing it in person unnerves Jamie. Catherine moves closer to him and 
      he puts his hands on her shoulders. 

                                      JAMIE  
                        Everything's going to be okay.  

      He looks into her eyes, standing intoxicatingly close to her. He takes 
      her hands in his. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                      I love you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                      I know. 
                                (beat) 
                        Jamie& 
                              (sighs) 
                      I did feel things... see things& but I 
                        didn't know what it was. I thought I 
                        was going crazy. 


 48 
                                       JAMIE 
                                (excited) 
                        No, Catherine, you're not crazy. What 
                        did you see? What did you feel? 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Images, flavors... faces& 
                          loneliness... 

      She is quaking in his hands, vulnerable. They are LINKED. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        You're shivering. 

      He holds her in his arms tightly. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                      I could use something to drink. 
                                (breaking the embrace) 
                        Would you like something? 

      She moves to the drinks cart across the room. Trying to calm his racing 
      heart, he takes a seat on the couch in the middle of her jungle. 

      Catherine watches him. 

                                        CATHERINE (CONT'D) 
                        I'm glad you're here with me. 

      She crosses to Jamie. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        So am I. 

      She sinks into the couch next to him and sips her drink. Jamie follows 
      her lead. He swallows the drink and grimaces. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        It s bitter. 

      Catherine takes Jamie s drink from him and places it aside. She kisses 
      him deeply. Soon Jamie is on top of her, his dream coming true. 

      Suddenly, Jamie is in the all-too-familiar position of his nightmare. 
      He freezes for a moment, as gooseflesh strokes him and departs. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I just feel a little dizzy. 

      REVEAL on the drinks cart, a PILL BOTTLE lying on its side. Several 
      SLEEPING TABLETS spill out. This is the source of bitterness in his 
      drink. 

 49 
       Catherine kisses Jamie deeply as he swoons, his mind slipping away. His 
      dizziness soars as it all heats up. 

      Catherine's hand suddenly slides under the sofa cushion, as if just to 
      grasp, but in a lightning movement, her hand grips the handgun that is 
      jammed under Jamie's jaw. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What do you want? 

      He is totally taken off-guard. 

                                        CATHERINE (CONT'D) 
                        How long have you been watching me? 
                        What are you waiting for? Why don't 
                        you just throw me in a cell and get it 
                        over with? Or do you just want to fuck 
                        me? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        I'm not a cop and I'm not trying to 
                        blackmail you. 
                                (beat) 
                      I love you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Do you?  
                                (reliving the murder) 
                        Could you feel it, the knife? Could 
                        you feel it plunging into his flesh? 
                        Did you feel him jerking and fighting? 
                        Could you feel the blood running down 
                        your arms? 
                                (beat) 
                        Is that what made you love me? 

      Jamie tries to grab the gun from her and a stray bullet rips through 
      his calf. He knocks the gun from her and it flies across the room. 
      Jamie leaps after it. 

    A caged animal, she jumps on top of him. The gun is just out of reach. 
      Catherine claws for his wounded leg and jams her thumb into the bullet 
      hole. Jamie screams. 

      Catherine tumbles over him, grappling for the gun. She grabs it. 

      Jamie rolls across the carpet, reeling, his senses dulled by the drug. 
      He grabs an African spear from the corner, swinging it wildly at her. 
      It connects with her arm, breaking in two from the impact. 

    A shot goes wild, and plaster flies from the face of the tiger painted 
      on the wall. 




 50 
       He hits her again, breaking the spear. Catherine frantically grabs the 
      blade end of the spear and surges toward him with fury. She slashes his 
      sleeve open and blood flows.  

      Running on instinct, he punches her in the face, sending her sprawling.  

      Jamie dashes for the gun, only to be knocked out of the way by 
      Catherine. He crashes to the floor. 

      She scrambles for the gun as he reaches for the blade. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Catherine, no! 

      As she aims at him, he throws the blade at her. Catherine throws her 
      hand up, and the blade goes through her hand. She screams.  

      The gun tumbles to the floor, as she stares with animal disbelief at 
      the blade sticking out both sides of her hand. Jamie lunges for the 
      gun. He's on his knees, shaking, both hands clutching it, aiming it at 
      her. 

      With frightening strength, Catherine yanks the blade out of her hand. 
      Blood drools from the wound. She looks at him, poised to throw it. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                      I don't want to hurt you.  

                                        CATHERINE 
                        You should have never come here. 

      She grips the blade and takes a step closer, testing his resolve. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Catherine, please don't do this. I 
                        only want to help you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        You don't even know me. 

      She moves another step closer. Jamie raises the trembling gun. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Catherine, no. Don t make me do this. 

      She raises the blade over him. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT D) 
                        Catherine, please. 

      Looking down on him, he seems pitiful, broken, destroyed by his 
      romantic obsession.  

      Something is happening. Things start shifting.  


 51 
                                       JAMIE 
                        Oh, Jesus& 

      Jamie s POV is replaced by Catherine s. He is transposing. Jamie sees 
      himself cowering. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT D) 
                        Not now. 

      Jamie s aim wavers, adjusting to the mirror-effect and reverse-image 
      confusion of correcting his fire. 

      Catherine cocks her head in confusion. Jamie's eyes are blind. She 
      seems to understand what is happening. 

                                        CATHERINE  
                        It's happening now, isn t it? 

      RESUME Jamie s POV.  

                                        CATHERINE (CONT D) 
                        What do you see? 

      Jamie s POV flashes from his to Catherine s. Finally, his sightless 
      eyes widen, trying to see, but only looking back as a mirror through 
      her eyes. 

                                        CATHERINE (CONT D) 
                        You can t see me, can you? 

      His vision shifts momentarily. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Catherine! 

      The blade comes up in her hands, poised to slash. Just as she slashes 
      down, Jamie fires. 

      Catherine is thrown back by the force of the bullet, Jamie feeling it 
      as much as she. She lunges again and Jamie fires again. 

      Jamie is forced to fire again. Catherine crashes to the ground. He 
      experiences her being hit with each shot. On this last one, he crashes 
      back onto the floor with her in a white flash. 

                                      JAMIE (O/S) 
                        And I knew what it felt like to die. 

      Black. 

 
      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT 

      Jamie is still in Catherine's living room. That's where he's being 
      interviewed by DETECTIVES. 

 52 
       The Detective leans down and looks hard into Jamie s eyes. 

                                        DETECTIVE 
                        You know that's not an easy story to 
                        swallow. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I can't do anything about that. 

      The Detective just looks at him, considering the long, complicated, 
        unbelievable tale he's just heard. He looks like he actually believes 
      it.  

      The Detective signals a UNIFORMED OFFICER to turn on the lights. They 
      come on. 

                                        DETECTIVE 
                        Get them on the ambulance. 

      PARAMEDICS help Jamie out. 

      The Detective and his PARTNER watch silently as Jamie is taken away. 
      The Partner nods to the Detective. 

 
      EXT. CATHERINE'S CONDO BUILDING -- FRONT DOOR -- NIGHT 

      Jamie s stretcher is loaded into the ambulance. A crowd gathers. A 
      SIREN wails away, swallowed up by the night as the FLASHING RED LIGHTS 
      fade into the distance. 

      END OF EPISODE
