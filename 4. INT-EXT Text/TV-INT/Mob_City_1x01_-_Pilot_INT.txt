The gunman moves from the window to the front door (which
is locked, a set of keys dangling in the jamb). 

Bill arrives outside. The gunman faces him through the
glass, the shotgun leveled. 

Bill can see FOUR HOSTAGES huddled on the floor inside.6.

GUNMAN
What the hell you want? You
wanna be on a slab? That what
you wanna talk about?

Bill gestures to his ears, speaks loudly: 

BILL
Sorry! I'm having trouble hearing
you! Could you speak up? 

GUNMAN
I'LL BLOW YOU OUT OF YOUR DUMB
COP SHOES! YOU HEAR THAT OKAY?

Bill's "can't hear you" gestures increase...

BILL
SAY AGAIN? LITTLE LOUDER? 

GUNMAN
(glances to hostages)
They sent me a deaf cop, you
believe this shit? 
(top of his lungs)
YOU DEAF AND STUPID! YOU HEAR
ME NOW, BLUE BITCH?

Bill is shaking his head, motioning to his ears...

BILL
I JUST WANNA TALK! I'M UNARMED!
CAN YOU OPEN THE DOOR JUST A
CRACK SO WE DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT? 

Exasperated, the gunman steps close to the door, grabs
the keys dangling in the lock... 

No sooner does he turn them...

BAM! Bill shoves the door in hard, whacks the gunman right
between the eyes with the door frame.

The man staggers back half a step, tries to bring the
shotgun to fire, but Bill thrusts his arm in, grabs him
to hold him in place, and: 

BAM-BAM-BAM! Bill keeps ramming the door frame rapid-fire
into the man's face, like a boxer with a punching bag.

The gunman's legs buckle. Bill squeezes in, pulls the
shotgun from the gunman's grasp as he keels over...

Bill raises the shotgun and starts racking the pump
repeatedly, ejecting the shells, as:7.

IMAGE FREEZES: Bill caught in mid-action, a shotgun shell
frozen in the air before us...

JOE TEAGUE (V.O.)
This rookie will not be cited
for courage in the line of duty
for saving the lives of four
hostages. That's because nobody
likes him much. 
(beat)
Around the time Mickey Cohen
takes over running the L.A.
mob, Bill the Boy Scout here
will take over running the Los
Angeles Police Department. 

IMAGE UNFREEZES: Bill racking the pump, shells flying...

JOE TEAGUE (V.O.)
Nobody calls him numbnuts after
that. They call him Chief of
Police William Parker. Or sir.


The man enters backlit by bright daylight, a pure
silhouette...we still can't see his face.

The building's seen better days. He moves into the lobby,
pulls a CIGARETTE CASE...

DOLLY SHOT 

His HANDS are toying with the cigarette case (expensive)
as he moves down the long row of tenants' MAILBOXES, the
kind that have slots in the doors so you can peek in.

He's looking for a certain one. Pauses. 

ANGLE CLOSES IN, as:

He pulls a Dunhill, re-pockets the cigarette case.

Next comes a PAPER MATCHBOOK. He strikes one, lights his
Dunhill just above frame, blows a plume of smoke. 

Instead of re-pocketing the matchbook, he pulls out a pen
and jots something on the inside of its cover. 

He closes the cover, drops the matchbook into a mailbox
through the little slot in its door, and exits frame...9.

JOE TEAGUE (V.O.)
White hats, black hats. They do
exist. Guys like Parker, guys
like Cohen. They try to shape
the world in their image.

CAMERA MOVES IN TIGHT on the mailbox. The name written on
it is "Joe Teague."

DISSOLVE TO:


We're inside the mailbox looking out through the slots.
An eye appears, looks in, sees there's mail. 

JOE TEAGUE (V.O.)
Most of us have to make do
somewhere in the middle. We
live in a world of gray hats.

A KEY IS SLOTTED. The door swings open, revealing:

JOE TEAGUE. A face equal parts brutal and handsome. Like
a boxer's face. Not a face you mess with. 

He's a man who knows the world's pain, is on a first-name
basis with it, and carries a piece of it in his pocket. 

He grabs his meager mail, starts to shut the door, but
stops and peers back in. Is that a matchbook?

He pulls it out, puzzled. 

CLOSEUP: MATCHBOOK

On the front: "Bunny's Jungle Club, Central Avenue." A
printed address and phone number. 

His fingers turn it over...

On the back: A stylized drawing of a BLACK JAZZ PLAYER,
skinny tie and sunglasses, blowing a sax...

PRE-LAP THE SOUND OF A TORTURED, SMOKY SAXOPHONE...


...taking us from the drawing on the matchbook to the
real thing: a BLACK SAX PLAYER, caught in a glare of stage
lights, his sax crying like an angel dying of grief...

A JAZZ TRIO plays to a room filled with shadows and smoke,
DRINKERS and JAZZ FIENDS, PLAYERS and HUSTLERS...10.

AT THE BAR

Joe Teague sits with a shotglass of bourbon, a pack of
Lucky Strikes and an ashtray on the bar before him. 

He knocks loose a Lucky, tears off a match from the
matchbook he found in his mailbox, lights up.

He throws an idle glance. On the bar, almost within arm's
reach, is a big glass bowl of identical matchbooks. 

He stares again at the matchbook he's holding.

CLOSEUP: MATCHBOOK

Hand-written inside the cover: "8 o'clock. Be at the bar."

JOE

sits trying to divine the matchbook's presence in his
life. It means something, he just doesn't know what. 

AT THE ENTRANCE

A guy walks into a bar...

HECKY NASH, a little man in a loud bow-tie and a louder
jacket. He sees Joe at the bar, works up his nerve...

AT THE BAR

Joe, not a man who misses much, clocks Hecky approaching
him in the reflection of the bar's mirror. 

Hecky keeps glancing Joe's way. Subtle he's not. He steps
to the bar, orders a beer. The bartender brings one. 

Beer in hand, Hecky sidles down the row of stools, trying
to catch Joe's eye. Joe tries to tune him out.

HECKY
You the guy?

JOE
The guy.

HECKY
Yeah, the guy.

JOE
Nah, that guy left. I'm the
other guy. The one drinking.

Undeterred, Hecky slides onto the neighboring stool.11.

HECKY
No, you're him. Master Gunnery
Sergeant Teague.

Joe's shotglass stops near his lips, hovers there. That's
a name he wasn't expecting.

HECKY
Marines, right?

Joe follows through, knocks back his bourbon, signals the
bartender for a refill. 

JOE
Not lately.

HECKY
Not now, but then. Joe Teague,
that's what the fella said.

Joe looks over at Hecky. Committing the face. Joe breaks
his gaze as the bartender comes by, tops him up.

JOE
What fella we talking about?

HECKY
The one who said you'd be here
and I should look you up. He
told me to call you "Master
Gunnery Sergeant Teague." Said
you'd get a kick out of it.

JOE
What else this fella say?

HECKY
Said you was in the Pacific.
Said you killed every Jap on
Iwo single-handed. That true?

Joe takes a last drag, tamps out his cigarette.

JOE
I might'a missed one or two. 

Joe slides the matchbook over in front of Hecky. 

JOE
This yours? It was in my mailbox
with the electric bill. 

Hecky opens the cover, sees the message: "8 o'clock. Be
at the bar." He chuckles, folds it shut, slides it back.12.

HECKY
Somebody tosses this in your
mailbox, you come running? You're
one curious guy.

Joe drains his shotglass, signals the bartender again. 

JOE
Look. You don't know me. Why
ruin a good thing?  

HECKY
Might be a grand in it for you,
is why. Couldn't hurt to listen,
could it?

Hecky falls silent as the bartender comes by to refill
Joe's glass. Hecky waits until he's gone, leans in.

HECKY
I need a pal. 

JOE
Get a dog.

HECKY
Nah. They shed. Gotta walk 'em. 
(leans closer)
I need a real pal. A Marine,
let's say. A guy who can handle
himself. All you gotta do is
show up, look mean. An hour of
your time, tops. You walk away
a grand richer.

JOE
Add some details. 

Hecky sighs, wondering how much to say.

HECKY
The guy who said you killed
those Japs says you're a man
who can be trusted. I asked
around, people are of that
general opinion. I can confide?

JOE
Confide away.

HECKY
(leans in)
Okay. There's a guy, see. 13.

JOE
Not the guy who said I killed
those Japs. 

HECKY
No, not him, he's just a go-
between. He lawyers sometimes
for this other guy, the one I'm
talking about. I won't say his
name, but you'd know who he is. 

JOE
How?

HECKY
You read the papers?

JOE
The funnies. Is it Popeye? 

HECKY
No, it's not Popeye. But you'd
know him. This guy...who isn't
Popeye...desires something that
I have. I like to make people
happy, so I want him to have
it. Thing is, I wanna be
compensated. It's a transaction. 

JOE
So transact. There a hitch?

HECKY
Yeah, there's a hitch. The guy's
the hitch. He's not famous for
being reasonable. And he seems
to resent the fact that I've
invited him to do this business. 

JOE
Why? What's the item?

HECKY
I can't tell you that.

JOE
Been nice knowing you.

Joe gets up to leave, but Hecky settles him back down.

HECKY
Hey, hey, relax. I can't say
the item, you understand. But
I'll give you this: Let's just 
(MORE)14.

HECKY (CONT'D)
say the item for sale could
make life very difficult for
this guy if it, say, fell into
certain hands other than his. 

Joe leans back on his stool, peers at the man.

JOE
You're blackmailing somebody.

HECKY
That's a harsh word.

JOE
It fits. And you want me there
in case the guy who isn't Popeye
decides to be...unreasonable. 

HECKY
You tag along, watch my back,
that's it. Bingo.

Beat. Joe staring. He reaches to the small of his back,
pulls something off his belt, lays it on the bar.

It's a DETECTIVE'S BADGE in a clip-on leather mount. He
gives Hecky a good long look at it. Their eyes meet.

JOE
You do know I'm a cop, right?

Hecky is completely unbothered; of course he knew.

HECKY
You telling me you don't
moonlight? All you cops do,
it's your Christmas fund. A
grand buys a lot of tinsel. Get
a tree to put it on.

Joe slides the badge off the bar, re-clips it to his belt.

JOE
Why me? Why a cop? 

HECKY
Because you're a cop. That's
the beauty part. These people
don't kill cops. There's too
much business at stake, so they
don't do it. Ever. The mugs who
show up for this thing see you
standing there, they'll have to
play nice. 15.

Hecky finishes his beer, wipes his mouth, stands up.

HECKY
You should shine that badge up
real nice, wear it on the front
of your belt like this...
(miming on himself)
...right above your pecker where
they can see it. 

JOE
I'll think about it.

HECKY
Don't think too long. It's gotta
happen soon, next night or two.
(pulls his wallet)
Here's my card, my name's on
it...

JOE
I know who you are. Hecky Nash.
I caught your act on the Strip
a few years back. 

Hecky puffs up a bit, loves being recognized.

HECKY
Clover Club. Sweet gig while it
lasted. You bring a date? She
laugh? I was funny, right?

JOE
Not as funny as you were tonight.

HECKY
Oh, zing, and I thought I was
the comedian. Hey, try this
one. A guy walks into a bar... 

He tucks his card into Joe's pocket.

HECKY
By the end of the week, he's a
grand richer. No joke.

REFLECTED IN THE BAR MIRROR

Hecky walking away...

RACK TO Joe's face in the mirror, his expression
unreadable, watching Hecky head for the exit...

Joe shifts his gaze, signals for the check...16.

AT THE ENTRANCE

Hecky comes past us on his way out...

ENDFRAME ON A MAN IN A PORKPIE HAT as Hecky goes by. 

Porkpie turns his face to the wall, trying to be
unobtrusive, waits until Hecky's out the door. 

ANGLE CLOSES on Porkpie as he turns back, gazes across
the club, eyes riveted to Joe at the bar. 

Joe's getting up to leave. Porkpie hurries from the club.


...and hurries across the street, dodging traffic. He
gets to the car and jumps in the passenger side.

A RUDDY-FACED MAN is behind the wheel, clocking Hecky
moving up the sidewalk. He reaches for the key, but:

PORKPIE HAT 
Hang on... 

RUDDY FACE
What? Why?

Porkpie motions "just wait," nudges the other man's
attention toward the club.

Moments later, Joe exits, heads up the sidewalk. 

Porkpie and Ruddy Face trade a look.

PORKPIE HAT
They were very cozy.

The men sit, watching Joe disappear in the crowd...

DISSOLVE TO:


Joe signs his name in a log book...

SERGEANT JIMMY DELANEY (thick glasses, big hearing aid,
in charge of the Records Room since the dawn of time)
hands off a file (somebody's criminal jacket). 18.

JOE
Thanks, Jimmy.

DELANEY
Don't forget where ya found it.
Don't make me come look for ya.


Joe wanders up the hallway, absorbed in the file. He turns
a corner, enters his office...


...and is surprised to find Hal Morrison sitting at his
(Joe's) desk with his feet up, Joe's phone to his ear.

HAL
...yeah, he just walked in.
(beat)
Yes, Jimmy, it's in his hands.
I will make sure he brings it
back. He promises. Right?
(Joe nods)
He just nodded, Jimmy. Yes.

Hal hangs up. Leans back in the chair. Twiddles his thumbs.

HAL
Read any good files lately?

Joe is wary. He lays the open file down, slides it across
the desk. Hal leans forward, peers at it.

THE FILE

It's a criminal jacket. MUG SHOTS of Hecky.

HAL

pulls out reading glasses, perches them on his nose.

HAL
Herschel Nussbaum. Aka "Hecky
Nash." Hmm. Stage name, I bet.
A third-rate comedian with a
few gambling arrests. 
(glances up)
I doubt he'll ever make the
Public Enemy list. 

JOE
Detective Morrison. Make yourself
at home. What can I do for you?19.

Hal pulls a small pad, checking his notes.

HAL
I'm curious why somebody that
my people are tailing...a third-
rate comedian with a few gambling
arrests...shows up at a seedy
jazz club on Central Avenue
last night and has a drink with
a detective from this division.

He looks up at Joe, waits for the answer.

JOE
It's not that seedy. 

HAL
Music good?

JOE
If you like jazz.

HAL
Next morning, this same detective
pulls the comedian's jacket. I
guess I'm not the only one
curious.
(taps the file)
Friend of yours?

Joe knows the awkward spot he's in. Plays it straight. 

JOE
Met him once. I caught his act
at the Clover a few years back,
bought him a beer.

HAL
And?

JOE
He spotted me in Bunny's last
night. Came up and offered me
an after-hours job. 

HAL
Doing what?

JOE
He's blackmailing somebody. He
wants me to tag along, see he
doesn't wind up in a dumpster.  

Hal absorbs that, rises to the window, nods outside at
the ongoing press event. 20.

HAL
I was just out there listening
to the mayor having to defend
his record as a crusader against
police corruption. Lot of heat
these days, lot of scrutiny.
City's looking to make examples
of cops who step out of line,
or haven't you heard?

JOE
I was just sitting there...

HAL
...minding your own business,
having a drink, out of the blue
a guy comes up you haven't seen
in years, met him only once,
and he tries to engage you in a
criminal conspiracy.

JOE
Right.

Beat. Hal sighs, dubious, motions "give me more."

JOE
You'll love this. The guy he's
blackmailing?

HAL
He give you a name?

JOE
No. But it's somebody high up
in the mob.

HAL
How high?

JOE
High. Somebody who gets his
name in the papers.

Hal pauses, the ramifications falling into place. 

HAL
You were gonna bring this to
me, right?

JOE
Why else would I pull the file?

Off Hal, not sure whether to believe him...21.


Hal, with Joe at his side, faces William Parker:

HAL
Detective Teague reported the
incident to me as soon as he
came in this morning. Of course
we brought it straight to you.

Parker looks to Miles Hewitt, listening and taking notes.

PARKER
I sense a unique opportunity. 

HEWITT
Could be big. Depends on what
this blackmail material is.
(to Joe)
You have no idea?

JOE
Nash wouldn't say. But he made
it sound like it had weight. 

PARKER
If it's enough to blackmail a
high-ranking mobster, it must
be strong evidence. We get our
hands on it, we could bring
down somebody big, cripple
organized crime in this city.
(to Hal)
That's a win we could use right
now. Silence a lot of criticism.

HEWITT
It would reflect well on this
department. Not to mention the
people in this room.
(to Parker)
Things like this get mayors re-
elected. Mayor Bowron's a man
who remembers his friends.  

Parker approaches Hal and Joe.

PARKER
Bring us whoever shows up for
this exchange...and the evidence.
Catch them in the act, fellas,
that's key...
(wry glance to Hal)
Key to the kingdom?22.

He moves to Joe, gives him an appraising look.

PARKER
You're on loan to Hal's unit
until further notice. Bring
home the bacon, Detective Teague.
(shakes his hand)
Do this right, you could make
some friends.


Hal and Joe exit the office, move up the hallway:

HAL
You get what just happened?
(off Joe's look)
Bill Parker just teed you up to
be his golden boy. Thing like
this could very well put him
one step closer to being our
next Chief. Two things you need
to know about Bill the Boy Scout.
One, it's a position he deserves.

JOE
And two?

HAL
He's also a man who remembers
his friends. You'd write your
own ticket. We both would.


The DETECTIVES of Hal Morrison's squad are gathered around
a table in a dense haze of cigarettes smoke...

Two we recognize: Porkpie Hat is MIKE HENDRY, Ruddy Face
is PAT DOLAN.

Also present are TUG PURCELL, EDDY SANDERSON, NICK BLEDSOE,
and JOHN "FAT JACK" BRAY.

Joe's in the middle of them, feeling like the new stray
in the kennel being sniffed by all the other dogs. 

Hal stands at the head of the table with Nash's file:

HAL
Our pal Hecky. A wannabe that
never was. And a bad gambler.

JOE
That file doesn't say mobster. 23.

HAL
No, but he's been hip-deep in
their world his whole life.
Rubbed a lot of elbows.

HENDRY
Hell, he's friends with Mickey
Cohen since they were kids.
This guy knows things. A lot of
things. 

HAL
He'd make a formidable witness.
We've tried to squeeze him a
few times, but he wriggles away.  

JOE
What's special about now? Why
were you guys tailing him? 

DOLAN
Sooner or later, guy like this
is ripe to get flipped. Lately
he's been riper.

Hal slides the file to Joe. 

HAL
Mr. Nash's fortunes are in
serious decline. He's racked up
a lot of gambling debts, owes a
lot of money to the wrong people.
(takes a seat)
They carry him for old time's
sake, but that kind of patience
runs out. When it does...

JOE
You wanna be there to catch him
when he falls, offer him a way
out. Long as he goes witness. 

HENDRY
The man twigs.

DOLAN
Tol' you he was bright.

HENDRY
I didn't believe you.

JOE
(glances to Hal)
Where do you get these guys?24.

Hendry rises, crosses the room toward a phone...

HENDRY
Me, he found under a rock. 
(grabs the phone)
Pat here washed up on the beach
one day. 
(gathers the cord)
Eddy there crawled out of a
drain pipe.
(brings the phone)
Nick and Tug got left in a basket
on his doorstep. 

PURCELL
He raised us from puppies.

"Fat Jack" Bray, the fattest and oldest in the room, leans
over and crushes out his cigarette in Joe's ashtray.

FAT JACK
I danced with the ballet. Didn't
work out.

Hendry slams the phone down on the table in front of Joe,
leans over it.

HENDRY
You? You pull this off, you're
on all our Christmas lists.

Joe stares at the phone. Pulls out Hecky's card.

HAL
Time and location. Those are
vital.

Joe picks up the cradle, starts dialing...


A RINGING PHONE shatters the silence, jerking Hecky from
sleep. Tangled in sheets, he grabs the phone...

HECKY
What? Huh? Who's this?
(listens)
Yeah, right. No, now's a fine
time. Just wakin' up...

Next to him: his girlfriend, JASMINE, picks her head off
the pillows, half-asleep, murmuring:

JASMINE
Who's that?25.

Hecky's trying to listen, motions "be quiet."

HECKY
Really? Yeah. Great news. Worth
waking up for.
(pause)
Let's do it tonight. I'll make
a call, set it in motion...


JOE
I need when and where.
(checks his watch)
Griffin? Yeah, I can meet you
then. But Hecky, I need to know
where the exchange is happening.
(beat)
'Cause I don't walk in blind.
Tell me now or find someone
else. I mean it.
(listens)
Okay. If that's where they
agreed. Right.

He hangs up. All eyes on him.

JOE
He's got a gig tonight at the
Griffin. You know it?

BLEDSOE
Yeah, it's a dive. Where old
strippers go to die.

JOE
I'm meeting him at ten o'clock,
when he gets off. We'll drive
to the exchange from there.
(to Hal)
Baldwin Hills. The oil fields.

SANDERSON
Oil fields. Goddamn it.

Hendry rises to a CITY MAP hanging on wall hooks.

FAT JACK
Poor kid. Thought they'd make
it easy on you? Give you a nice
warm closet to pop out of? 

JOE
What's wrong with it?26.

Hendry pulls the map, lays it on the table.

HENDRY
Oil fields are thirty square
miles of horseshit. Terrain's
wide open. There's no place for
us to be, no place to hide...

HAL
...no way to predict where you'll
be in all those square miles...

PURCELL
Odds are great they see us up
there and just drive off, blow
the whole deal.

FAT JACK
Mob loves it. Been dumping bodies
up there since Prohibition. 

Everybody's hunched over the map, examining options.

HENDRY
Closest we can be to you is
down the hill, around Jefferson.
That's over half a mile away.

PURCELL
(to Hal)
That's not good for backup.
Take us three minutes to get up
that hill. Maybe longer.

JOE
So?

FAT JACK
You need backup, you want it
now, not in three minutes. 

SANDERSON
How's he signal us? Dead zone
up there, radios don't work.

FAT JACK
Very Pistol. Sign one out, put
it in his trunk.
(to Joe)
It's a flare gun.

JOE
I know. I've used a few.27.

FAT JACK
Then no problem. Time is right,
you fire that flare, we'll come
charging up the hill like the
cavalry. I'm John Wayne...
(points at Hendry)
...he's Rhonda Fleming.

Pause. The men trading looks. It's a plan. But dicey.

HAL
You'll be on your own up there.
Exposed. Especially after you
fire that flare.

FAT JACK
Three minutes. That's a long
time to wait when your ass is
hanging in the breeze.

JOE
You watch for my signal. I'll
worry about my ass. 

Glances are traded. He's earning respect...


Exactly as Sanderson described it: a place where old
strippers go to die. On-the-skids comedians too:

HECKY
Your ass? No kidding! I thought
that was your wife!
(gets some laughs)
It's got her smile... 
(a few guffaws)
So I pull out, apologize to the
guy. Honest mistake, I thought
I was getting a flutter.
(a few chuckles)
Give her my regards, Senator...

IN THE AUDIENCE

Joe hovering near the door, waiting. People around him
ordering drinks, most of them already half-bagged.

HECKY
(points to a guy)
You like that one? Remind me to
check your pulse later.28.

ON STAGE

Hecky sweating, hating every moment, big false smile:

HECKY
Speaking of pulse, here's a gal
who'll give yours a flutter...
(motions offstage)
...treat her nice, she'll do it
twice...Miss Dixie Hills!

A 3-PIECE BAND strikes up. The spotlight pulls from Hecky
to a SCARY-LOOKING STRIPPER strutting onstage...

Hecky fades off stage, catching Joe's eye...


Hecky's getting paid cash: A FAT SWEATY GUY chewing a
cigar crosses his palms with a few wrinkled bills. 

Hecky nods and moves off, leading Joe down narrow, cramped
corridors, the walls peeling and water-stained. 

HECKY
I'm reduced to working places
like this. Christ, it's like
rolling in vomit.
(glances back)
Gotta make a fast call.

Hecky turns a corner, squeezing past STRIPPERS, comes to
a pay phone on the wall outside the restrooms. Joe hangs
back, waiting as Hecky drops a dime and dials.

(During the following, Joe is B.G., gets checked out by a
few passing STRIPPERS. One stops to chat him up, but he
demurs, pointing at Hecky: "Waiting on him, got business,"
etc. The girl moves on: "Maybe I see you later?") 

HECKY
Yeah, it's me checking in. I
said I'd call. 
(beat)
Yes, tonight. Still. Uh-huh.
(beat)
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
(beat)
Jasmine, don't start. I mean
it. Not again. Jasmine...
(pause)
Jasmine. I don't need this...

He pounds the receiver against the wall to get her to
shut up, puts the receiver back to his ear.29.

HECKY
I have the floor now? This is
happening, okay? 
(beat)
I don't care, I can't listen to
your grief anymore!
(beat)
I can't take it! Stop talking!
Now me! You'll be packed, right?
I wanna make sure. Tell me yes.
(beat)
By the time I get there! Like
we talked about! I honk, you're
out the door. No going back,
not even for a toothbrush.
(beat)
Jas...don't get weepy. Just do
like I say. Be packed and ready.
(beat)
Good. Just relax, okay? It's
gonna be fine. Love you. 

He hangs up, has to take a moment. He's so wound up he's
shaking. He takes a long breath, turns and goes back up
the corridor to where Joe's waiting. 

HECKY
Let's do this.

Hecky leads him off...

DISSOLVE TO:


Joe following Hecky. He sees Hecky pull over...

Joe does the same. Kills his engine and lights. 


A guy walks into a bar...

At first, all we see are his familiar TWO-TONE FLORSHEIMS. 

WE TRACK THE SHOES across the club...

AT THE BAR

As he comes to a bar stool (we're framed below his face),
we also recognize the painted SILK TIE: cards, tumbling
dice, martinis. 

His hat descends into frame as he takes it off, sets it
on the bar... 

WE FINALLY REVEAL HIM as he sits into the shot:

NED STAX. Young, rakish, movie-star handsome; the kind of
face that makes women go all fluttery.

NED
Scotch, rocks.

The bartender goes to pour his drink...

Ned pulls out his expensive cigarette case, opens it,
pulls out a Dunhill. 

He starts patting pockets, trying to find his lighter...

ANGLE COMES AROUND...

REVEAL Joe sitting one stool over with his bourbon and
his crappy Lucky Strikes. 

He knocks one loose, lips it, tears off a match from the
matchbook he found in his mailbox, lights up. 

He puts the matchbook on the bar, sends it sliding in
Ned's direction. Ned snags them. 

The bartender brings his drink and an ashtray, leaves.

NED
Thanks.

Ned tears off a match, lights his cigarette. Takes a look
at his handwritten note inside...then touches the burning
match to the remaining matches. The matchbook flares up.

He drops it in the ashtray, watches it blacken and burn.45.

Joe pulls something from his coat, lays it on the bar
between them...

Ned finds himself staring at Hecky's envelope, decorated
with brown spatters of dried blood.

Ned glances around. Jesus. He picks his hat off the bar,
shifts it over, covers the envelope with it.

NED
That's fifty grand under my
hat.

JOE
That much? I guess your boss
will be happy to get it back.

NED
He doesn't care about that. He
cared about not getting taken
by a two-bit loser.

JOE
So he should be doubly happy.

Ned hesitates, takes a sip of his scotch. 

NED
You're missing the point. He
wants you to have it, with his
compliments. 
(off Joe's look)
Take it. You earned it. For
service well rendered. 

JOE
(beat)
That's crap. We both know what
it really is. Your boss thinks
he just bought himself a cop.
An enforcer with a badge.

NED
That a bad thing? You've got
valuable skills. I could steer
a lot of work your way.
(beat)
It's a good offer. 

Joe weighs it briefly. Looks at Ned.

JOE
Here's my counter. Tell Bugsy
Siegel to take that money and
shove it up his ass.46.

NED
In those words?

JOE
Quote me.

Ned absorbs that, smiles a little. He respects the answer.

Joe signals the bartender for his check.

NED
No, no, I got this.
(Joe hesitates)
C'mon. Least you can do is let
me buy you a drink. 

Joe gives in with a shrug. He gathers his things off the
bar, getting ready to go... 

NED
If not for the money, then why? 

JOE
You have to ask? You fed me the
guy, you knew what would happen.

NED
Maybe. Maybe I'm just that
clever. Maybe I want to hear
you say it.
(as Joe rises)
Why'd you kill the comedian?

Joe crushes his cigarette out in his ashtray.

JOE
Maybe I didn't like his jokes.

Joe leaves his stool, moves past Ned toward the exit...

But pauses behind him. 

JOE
I heard you passed the bar exam.

NED
Passed it, hell. I aced it. Top
five percent.

JOE
I always said you had brains.

NED
Yeah, you always did.47.

Joe pats Ned's shoulder goodbye, proud of him. 

NED
Semper fi, Gunny.

JOE
Semper fi, Marine.

Joe walks away. 

Ned watches him go, signals the bartender for a refill.

JOE

goes past the stage on his way out. 

ENDFRAME ON THE SAX MAN as Joe leaves our shot... 

ANGLE CLOSES ON THE SAX MAN, haloed in a glare of stage
lights, pouring his soul through the instrument...

CLOSE TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on the saxophone, notes bending,
octaves shredding, telling its story as we

DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAX SOLO CONTINUES...


A coda, consisting of a single shot:

A SLOWLY WIDENING ANGLE...

Starting with a woman's face. Staring. Waiting.

All the bad breaks haven't erased her beauty. But all the
hard knocks have hammered little dents in her heart. 

Tonight, like so many times before, another little dent
will form. She's already feeling it. 

OUR WIDENING ANGLE reveals Jasmine by the door, sitting
on her suitcase, smaller bags arrayed around her...

Staring. Waiting. 

It's gotten so very late...
