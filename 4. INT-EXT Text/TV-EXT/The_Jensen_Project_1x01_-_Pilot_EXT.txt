      CHYRON: Three Days Earlier

      We fade in on a typical suburban home, just outside of 
      Baltimore, Maryland where the Montgomery's currently live.


      ECU on BRODY S FACE as it s pummeled by 120mph winds. 

      We pull back and see his entire BODY bouyed by the high force 
      winds. 

        Exhilarated, Brody shouts and turns flips and just when we 
      think he s free-falling, mid-skydive at a thousand feet--

      We pull back and reveal...he s in a WIND TUNNEL SIMULATOR.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Claire s car screeches to a halt outside a private airport. 
      Matt and Claire jump out.

                                  MATT 
                    I ll search the hangars.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I ll check with the office. Maybe 
                    they ve seen him.


      Brody exits, spots his mom s car and quickly turns in the 
      other direction when Claire rounds the corner.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What were you thinking?  

                                  BRODY
                    How d you find me?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Used a satellite to track your cell 
                    phone.

                                  BRODY
                    Talk about invasion of privacy and 
                    lack of trust.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   17.  


                                  CLAIRE
                    Trust is earned. And you ve 
                    betrayed ours one too many times.

      Up walks Matt.

                                  MATT
                    You forged doctor s notes using my 
                      letterhead? Not cool Brody. 

                                  BRODY
                    I can explain.

                                  MATT
                    What are you doing here anyway?

                                  BRODY
                      Conducting a scientific experiment.

      Brody pulls out his I-pod.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t want to hear it.

                                  BRODY
                    I was testing the rate of travel 
                    for sound waves.

                                  MATT
                    That s pretty cool.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (shoots Matt a look)
                    So much for a united front.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                          (to Brody)
                    Just grab your bag and come on.

                                  BRODY
                    Where are we going?

      Brody grabs his bag. 

      Claire and Matt head towards a sleek, private HELICOPTER with 
      the Jensen Group logo emblazoned on the side. 

      Ingrid stands beside it, looking very official. Brody s 
      instantly suspicious.

                                  BRODY (CONT'D)
                    We re getting on the chopper?              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   18.  


                                  CLAIRE
                    Yep.

                                  BRODY
                    Where are we going?

      Matt and Claire exchange looks.

                                  MATT
                    We re sending you to military 
                    school.

                                  BRODY
                    What?! No way -- you re kidding 
                    right, Dad?

                                  MATT
                     Fraid not son--

                                  BRODY
                    I ll change. Mom, please, can we 
                    talk about this?

                                  MATT
                    Relax. We re not sending you away.

                                  CLAIRE
                    We re going to the Jensen Group.

                                  BRODY
                    What?

                                  CLAIRE
                    There s a crisis and they need our 
                    help.

                                  BRODY
                    Care to elaborate?  

                                  INGRID
                    (to Matt)
                    If you re coming, we have to go 
                    NOW.





      Matt, Claire and Brody step up to the helicopter. The chopper 
      blades start to twirl. Off them...      


                                  END OF ACT ONE              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   19.  


                                        ACT TWO 


      The Jensen chopper cuts through the clear blue sky.


      The New York City skyline. And just in case you weren t sure.

      CHYRON: New York City


      The chopper starts it s descent. Brody stares out over the 
      Jensen campus. 

      The various buildings dusted with snow, the wooded terrain of 
      the Alleghaney Mountains and an old hunting lodge smack dab 
      in the middle of all. Think Ralph Lauren winter retreat -- 
      beautiful, majestic and impressive.

                                  CLAIRE 
                          (to Brody, re: lodge)
                    That s where your father and I 
                    first met.

                                  MATT
                    Feels like coming home.



      The four of them step out of the chopper. Matt and Claire 
      take in their surroundings. Brody is clearly blown away.

                                  BRODY
                    What is this place?

                                  INGRID
                    Welcome to the Jensen Group, Brody.  

      In a series of QUICK CUTS Ingrid brings the trio up to speed:              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   22.  



      Ingrid and Matt walk and talk. 

                                  MATT
                          (re: Claire)
                    Don t worry. She ll come around.

                                  INGRID
                    She s still upset with me after all 
                    these years. I m not sure she ll 
                    ever get past it.

                                  MATT
                    She s here -- it s a start.
                          (looks around)
                    Feels good to be back.

                                  INGRID
                    Like old times.

                                  MATT
                    I m sorry about Jacob. We heard 
                    well after the funeral. You guys 
                    were a great couple.

                                  INGRID
                    In the end it was his body that 
                    gave out, not his spirit. But I 
                    know he s still with me...

                          (pats her heart)
                      especially during times like this.

                                  MATT
                    How are you doing?

                                  INGRID
                    Honestly, I feel betrayed and 
                      abandoned. Edwin s the only family 
                    I have left on this earth. Yet I 
                    know he felt betrayed by me, too.  


      Brody plods behind an APPRENTICE (20 s) with a beaker full of 
      liquid. The apprentice crosses into Jensen Headquarters.

      BRODY S POV: The Apprentice steps on a digitized PAD in the 
      doorway of HQ (think welcome mat). The apprentice s name pops 
      on screen: FRANCINE LEE -- Access Approved, as do her vitals.

      Brody peeks into HQ from the hallway, sees the HIGH TECH ROOM 
      with WALL-SIZED, GLASS MONITORS (think CTU s wide, open space 
      meets the bridge of Star Fleet Command)

                                  BRODY
                    Sweet.


      Brody ducks out embarrassed. As he walks down the hall and 
      looks out the window, he notices

      OUTSIDE: A FIGURE dressed in ski gear carrying a snow board

                                  BRODY 
                    Hmmm...


      Brody looks around but the figure is gone. He looks at the 
      ground and sees a set of BOOT TRACKS so he pulls up his 
      hoodie and quickly follows the trail...

      AROUND THE LODGE, through some TREES, down a DIRT PATH until 
      he comes upon a MAINTENANCE SHED.


      The Boot Tracks end at the shed door. Brody scrapes at the 
      ice on the door window, tries to peek in. Can t see anything.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   29.  


                                  BRODY
                          (knocks)
                    Hello?  

      No answer. He tries the door -- it s locked. Then Brody sees 
      a KEYPAD. Looks around. No one s in sight. 

      Brody pops the key pad cover off. Hacks it. CLICK -- the 
      unlocked door creaks open. Brody ducks in.


      CHYRON: MONTREAL, CANADA

      An old Gothic cathedral stands watch as Edwin, Bud and TWO 
      HENCHMEN trot into an alley toward a back service entrance 
      labeled -- HIGHLAND LABORATORIES.


      GLASS SHATTERS. Bud pulls his gloved hand back through the 
      service door s broken window.


      Edwin struggles to keep up with Bud and the henchmen as they 
      race through dark, back alleys with both Security Guards in 
      hot pursuit.  

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Hold it!  

      Security Guard follows, calling for back-up and the police.

      HIS POV: Edwin and team race up the stairs of the Cathedral 
      into the exiting churchgoers.


      Bud kicks out a side door as Edwin and the henchmen run 
      through and jump into a car and speed off.


      Claire and Matt pace towards the chopper,  away team  gear in 
      hand. The rotors whir to life.

                                  MATT
                    Ready for this?

                                  CLAIRE
                    If you re asking if I m ready to 
                    confront my former mentor, stop him 
                    from using the nanobot for 
                    nefarious purposes thus saving the 
                    day and possibly the world...the 
                    answer is yes.

      Sam and Brody race up.

                                  BRODY
                    Mom! Dad! Um -- hello? 

                                  CLAIRE
                    Where do you think you re going?

                                  BRODY
                    With you.

                                  MATT
                    Not a good idea. 

                                  SAM
                    But you two haven t seen Edwin in 
                    like a decade. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    This isn t a field trip. A lot of 
                    people are counting on us.

                                  BRODY
                    We can help.

                                  CLAIRE
                    No. It s too dangerous.

      Claire hops on the chopper. Matt turns back to Sam and Brody.

                                  MATT
                    Stay here with Ingrid. We ll be 
                    back before you know it.

      Matt hops on the chopper -- it lifts off leaving Sam and 
      Brody in it s wake.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   53.  



      The helicopter lands in an abandoned parking lot.               THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   57.  


      INSIDE THE CHOPPER:


                                  SECURITY TEAM LEADER
                          (to Matt & Claire)
                    I ve alerted HQ that we ve landed.
                          (re: Nav system)
                    We re three blocks from the 
                    building.  

                                  CLAIRE
                          (checks Nav system)
                    I see it.



      Matt and Claire jump out, following the three security team 
      members. They all head off in the direction of Edwin s lab.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      OUTSIDE. Brody climbs out behind her. They see the helipad in 
      the distance.


      Sam races to a runway (near the helipad) and climbs onto the 
      platform of a sleek, ultra-modern CESSNA. 

      She presses keys on the security lock, the hatch slides open.  

                                    BRODY 
                    What are you doing?  

                                  SAMANTHA
                    We can t get to Ingrid, and we 
                    don t know how long Edwin will be 
                    at his current location.  If we 
                    don t go now then we might lose 
                    him. 
                          (Beat) 
                    Get in.

                                  BRODY
                    The plane?              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   66.  


      Sam nods working up the controls. Brody stands there frozen.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    This is not a good idea. Mom would 
                      definitely flog me for doing this.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Get in or jump off, but I have to 
                    go. Time is wasting and we ve got 
                    to stop Edwin!

                                  BRODY
                    (under his breath, weighs options)
                    Follow the pretty girl. Obey mom. 
                    Follow the pretty girl. Obey mom. 
                    Pretty girl, mom, pretty girl, mom.

      Then in SLO-MO (MOS):

      Brody looks up at Sam under the canopy of night s stars -- 
      the wind blows through her hair as she fiddles with the 
      craft s controls. 

      Sam shouts at Brody but he doesn t hear because he s so taken 
      with her. 

      Finally, Sam slaps Brody on the side of the head, breaks the 
      moment. 

                                  SAMANTHA
                    You comin  or what?

                                  BRODY
                          (to Sam)
                      Definitely.


      Brody climbs in, Sam fires up the engine.

      We see the CESSNA taxi for a brief moment then take off down 
      the runway.  


      The cessna jerks up then -- takes off. It s tiny lights 
      illuminate the blackened sky.

      The Cessna lands roughly in an abandoned field.


      Samantha hops out of the plane.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    I don t know. I m making it up as I 
                    go along.

                                  BRODY
                          (gulps)
                    Great.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   71.  



      Matt, Claire and the security team walk back to the chopper.

                                  MATT
                    I don t get it.

                                  GINNY
                          (over comm)
                    We ve double and triple-checked the 
                    data.

                                  CLAIRE
                    And?

                    You were in the right place. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    It must have been a set-up.
                    The million dollar question is: Not 
                    only how he did do it but where is 
                    he?  Or -- how d he know to do it?

      Off their looks.


      Sam and Brody step up to the alarm panel.

                                  SAM
                    I got this...

      Sam pulls out a multi-tool and pulls the numbered alarm panel 
      off the wall.  She starts manipulating the wires.

                                  BRODY
                    You know what you re doing?

                                  SAM
                    Hold the yellow wire, and tug on 
                    these two.  DO NOT let them touch 
                    the dotted wire.

      Brody squints to see which one is what in the moonlight.  Sam 
      has pulled out a circuitboard and is rewiring at lightning 
      pace.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Okay - now slide over the blue 
                    wire.  (Brody squints and tries to 
                    push it over)  No, the BLUE wire. 
                    (Beat)  Okay, try to hold still...              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   72.  


      Sam twists two wires and BOOM!  Sparks fly everywhere as the 
      main door hisses open.  


      The Jensen Helicopter hovers then lands. Matt and Claire jump 
      out.


      Sam races back to the Cessna. She places the assembler inside 
      and looks around to make sure she wasn t followed. She pulls 
      out her cell -- sees she has five  Missed Calls  from Ingrid.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   77.  



      CLOSE ON BRODY. His eyes flick open. 

      Lying on a bench he sits up. Groggy. Rubs sleep from his 
      eyes. Looks around, disoriented.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   78.  



      Brody at a payphone.

                    Brody? Are you ok? Where are you?

      Brody looks around, scared.

                                  BRODY
                    I have no idea.

      Claire, Matt watch as the Cessna sets down. Sam helps Brody 
      out. Matt and Claire grab Brody, clutches him. 

                                  MATT
                    It s so good to see you.

                                  BRODY 
                    You have no idea.

      A range of emotions flash across Claire s face.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What were you thinking? I ve told 
                    you a hundred times -- trust has to 
                    be earned -- and then you pull a 
                    stunt like this.

                                  BRODY
                    I m sorry, Mom. I know you re mad. 
                    But I was only trying to help.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Next time, don t. It s too much--

                                  BRODY
                    Okay.
                          (off her look)
                    I m okay.

      Claire s still affected. Brody hugs her.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    It s okay, Mom.

      Neeva exits, runs toward the parking lot. 


      Neeva aims her car remote. Her BMW roars to life.

      Kendrick hits the lot just as Neeva dives into her car. 

      Kendrick jumps in her car s path to block her --

                    Neeva -- wait!

      But Neeva steps on the gas. Kendrick darts out of the way at 
      the last minute. She s gone. Off Kendrick.

                    Okay.

                    We ll be in touch with Kendrick--

                    Thanks Sam. Take care of my boys.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Of course.

      Claire pats the Cessna. Sam closes the hatch. Starts up the 
      engine.

      ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HELIPAD

      Claire crosses to the chopper, hops in, careful to avoid 
      damaging the molecular assembler at her feet.

      The pilot takes off. Claire watches the distant Cessna taxi.


      Claire walks to a bench. Sets down the covered molecular 
      assembler. Comms Kendrick.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m in place.

      ON THE MONITOR

      Ginny pulls up coverage of the park and surrounding area.

                    No sign of Edwin. I ll let you know

                                  CLAIRE

      A pagoda style pavilion, closed for the winter, is a silent 
      sentinel beside a frozen lake. Clare, bundled against the 
      cold, stands alone on a small arching bridge. Waiting.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Edwin enters the garden through a circular gate. He spots

                    Where is it?

      Claire nods at the bag she s carrying. The Molecular 
      Assembler.

      Edwin stares at his old protege. Appraising her, then snorts 
      derisively, as though she somehow, she fails to meet his 
      approval, then reaches for the bag....

                                  EDWIN
                    Give it to me.

      She doesn t move, holding his eyes with an unwavering glare.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   106.

                    How will I know if you ve disabled 
                    the nanobot?

      Edwin s tone is condescending.

                                  EDWIN
                    Don t waste my time, Claire. You re 
                    obviously monitoring your son s 
                    vital functions. After I ve 
                    inspected the molecular assembler, 
                    I ll send a signal...

      He holds up his cell in a gloved hand.

      He curls the fingers of his out stretched palm.

                                  EDWIN (CONT D)
                    Now. If you don t mind...

                    what s to keep you from rebooting 
                    the nanobot once I give you the

      He smiles.

                                  EDWIN
                    Nothing. 

      He studies her.

      Her voice quavers with anger as she interrupts him.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Trust you? The man who stole my

                    child s life for his own selfish 
                    ends? Trust you Edwin?!!!

      She glares at him as she catches her breath. Edwin holds up 
      the cell. His face is crimson but his voice is controlled. 
        Threatening.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   108.

                    Be careful Claire. Be very careful.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Claire s not sure if Brody s dead or alive. Edwin stands over

                    How does it feel, Claire? To know 
                    you ve killed your own son?

      They stare at one another for a long moment, each lost in 
      their own thoughts, until finally, Edwin turns and walks 
      away. As he disappears behind the garden wall...
