ANGLE DOWN
on a tray table.
Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it.
Hands are counting the money.
The airline hostess announces
the arrival at JFK - in CZECH.
A hand reaches into a breast
pocket - pulling out two passports.
One is opened.
Belongs
to EMIL SLOVAK.
The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL.
The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to
him.
We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a
small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table.
The passport
is set down.
Oleg picks it up.
We hear Emil's voice in
CZECH.
The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH.
EMIL (V.O.)
Just do what I do.
Say the same thing I
say.
Don't open your mouth.
OLEG (V.O.)
Okay.
CAMERA DOLLIES down a long line of passengers.
They are
split into two lines - one for Americans, the other for
visitors.
CAMERA finally arrives at EMIL SLOVAK.
An
unshaven Czech in his mid-30's.
Tall, scraggly beard.
Piercing blue eyes.
He's dressed in an outdated suit.
His
eyes are alert, cunning and smart.
OLEG RAZGUL, stands in line behind Emil.
Oleg is big.
Not
tall - but wide.
A wrestler's body.
Emil looks at Oleg.
(The following is in CZECH and subtitled in ENGLISH.)
EMIL
Don't fool around.
OLEG
Okay.
Oleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to
take a picture of himself.
EMIL
Did you hear what I said?
OLEG
I want to document my trip to America.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
Next.
(Emil steps up)
Could I see your documents, please?
EMIL
Yes sir.
He hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an
image swipe.
Emil glances furtively back to Oleg.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
What is your intended purpose of your
visit to the United States?
EMIL
Two weeks holiday.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
How much money are you carrying with
you?
EMIL
I have five-hundred dollars.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
Can you show me?
Sir, no cameras in the
FIS area!
Oleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration
Officer.
Oleg puts the camera away.
Smiles sheepishly.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
(to Emil)
Is he with you?
Are you travelling
together?
EMIL
Yes.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
Please join us.
(to Oleg)
Come on forward.
EMIL
Is there a problem?
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
No, you're travelling together.
I want
to talk to you together.
Hi, how are
you?
Can I take a look at your
documents?
(takes Oleg's passport)
Are you related?
OLEG
Yes...he's my friend.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
Okay.
You're a Czech national and
you're a Russian national.
How do you
know one another?
Oleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off.
EMIL
We are both from Prague.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
(to Oleg)
How long are you planning to stay?
EMIL
Two weeks.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
EMIL
He doesn't speak English.
OLEG
I speak English.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
(to Oleg)
Then answer my questions.
Where were
you planning to stay during the two
weeks that you're here?
OLEG
New York.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
Yes, we're in New York now.
But where
are you planning to stay in New York?
OLEG
A cheap hotel.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
What are you coming here to do?
OLEG
I'm here for movies.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
Movies...to be in the movies or to see
movies?
OLEG
Yes.
No.
Both.
When I was a boy, I
see movie at school called "It's a
Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra.
Ever since I want to come to America.
Land of the free.
Home of the brave.
A
land where anyone can be anything. As
long as they are white.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
Excuse me?
EMIL
He made joke, bad joke.
First time on
airplane...
The SUPERVISOR comes over to see what the problem is:
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
Well, they've got valid visas, but they
don't have much money.
Uh... and I'm
not...uh, I think there's a possibility
they may be coming to live and reside.
SUPERVISOR
Look how long the line is.
We gotta
move 'em out.
I'll take them down to
secondary.
Emil looks at Oleg, pissed.
The place is empty except for one table at the end of the
bar.
EDDIE FLEMMING, Manhattan's most famous detective, and
his savvy, black partner, LEON JACKSON are having cocktails.
Eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired.
Not only
is he the best homicide detective Manhattan has ever seen,
he's continually mentioned in New York columns and has been
the subject of several magazine articles.
There's even been
a TV movie about one of his biggest cases.
Leon has been
with Eddie a long time and was also featured in the TV movie.
Sitting with Eddie and Leon is ROBERT HAWKINS, host and star
reporter for the tabloid show, "Top Story."
Hawkins is also
the best in the business and has dealt with them all: Joey
Buttafuco and Amy Fisher, Lorena Bobbit and OJ.
Wait staff bustles in the b.g. doing the morning set up.
Hawkins listens as Eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a "war
story" and a vodka tonic at the same time.
EDDIE
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant -
we got Emergency Service with the heavy
weapons standin' by - ready to go.
I
say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.
I
go to get the cigar and BOOM!
All the
sudden I turn around and a kid with a
shotgun let one go.
Right where I was
standin'.
That coulda been it.
I
coulda had my head blown off and for
what?
Some stupid kid got panicky,
takes the safety off and it's over.
If
I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for
a bad habit - I would've had my head
blown off.
HAWKINS
Jesus Christ.
PAULIE, the owner, walks up.
PAULIE
Speakin' of bad habits, everybody okay?
HAWKINS
Another martini.
LEON
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
EDDIE
Vodka tonic.
LEON
(rethinks it)
Maybe you could just put in a shot of
Martell?
Paulie takes the drinks off the table and an empty bottle of
vodka.
LEON (CONT'D)
(of Eddie's story)
It was freaky, I'll tell you.
Stupid
kid.
EDDIE
What's the kid gonna say - sorry?
Meanwhile I'm not here anymore.
Like last week - we were at the morgue
and this guy was all chopped up - spleen
here - liver there - his heart in a pan.
Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his
dog or buyin' a quart of milk.
Who
knows?
But some kid's robbed him for $3
or some shit and shot him and now you
can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a
human being and I'm thinkin' that's me.
Sooner or later.
That's me.
HAWKINS
Sooner or later that's everybody.
EDDIE
Not chopped up.
Not chopped up like
that.
I mean, what do I got left?
Coupla articles.
A medal or two.
Plaque here and there and in a coupla
years no one remembers me anymore.
HAWKINS
I think you're getting a little moody
there, Eddie.
EDDIE
I'm not moody.
Hawkins and Leon share a look.
HAWKINS
Isn't he a little moody?
LEON
Of course he's moody.
He thinks he's in
love.
HAWKINS
In love?
With who?
Paulie delivers the drinks and sets some cigars on the table.
Takes a seat next to Eddie.
Eddie asks Hawkins.
EDDIE
How old are your kids?
HAWKINS
My kids?
Let's see...Susan's 15.
Aundrea's 9.
Don't tell me you're
thinking about having a kid!
How old
are you?
Never mind.
Let me just tell you this: Every stupid
cliche you hear about kids - they change
your life, they make you a better
person, they make you whole...
(beat)
It's all true!
Before I had kids when
friends talked about their kids, I
wanted to vomit.
Now -- I get it.
Am I
right, Leon?
LEON
Absomotherfuckin'lutely.
You can have
all three of my ex-wives.
But somebody
so much as looks sideways at my four
girls -- I'd kill 'em.
(takes out his wallet)
You haven't seen my youngest have you?
As he hands pictures to Hawkins his cell phone rings.
LEON (CONT'D)
Yeah?
HAWKINS
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
PAULIE
My kids don't talk to me anymore but
they were great when they were young.
LEON
(into the phone)
Sure it's him?
Great!
(collapses the phone)
Unique's home.
They all rise from the table.
EDDIE
Paulie, I need the cure.
PAULIE
Step into my office.
Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave.
HAWKINS
So you got your kids listening to Opera?
You still singing in the church on the
weekends?
Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg.
They've
been there a while.
The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg.
SECONDARY OFFICER
Okay.
You work in a vodka factory.
I
understand that.
(to Emil)
And what kind of work do you do?
EMIL
I am butcher.
SECONDARY OFFICER
You're a butcher?
What do you use pig
intestines for?
EMIL
You stuff sausage in it.
SECONDARY OFFICER
And what do you do with the bones?
EMIL
Dog food.
Emil looks at Oleg.
Blaming his stupid responses at Passport
Control for their detainment.
SECONDARY OFFICER
Are you married?
EMIL
No.
Are you proposing?
ANGLE UP
through a thousand ICE CUBES.
A face plunges towards us...
Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink
full of ice.
He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot
eyes.
Presents a small black ring box to the mirror.
EDDIE
Will you marry me?
Wanna get married?
What are you doin' Saturday?
Leon enters.
Eddie turns.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
I'm gonna propose.
LEON
When?
EDDIE
Tomorrow.
At lunch.
LEON
You ready?
Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes.
Turns.
EDDIE
The thrill of the hunt.
I love it.
The brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the
stairs... Oleg cradling his camera.
Emil notices a crack
pipe on the floor and picks it up.
Smells the bowl.
OLEG
What?
EMIL
Smell like chemicals...for smoking
drugs.
Emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving
down the dirty hallway to a corner door.
He KNOCKS...FOOTSTEPS approach.
The door is opened by MILOS -
a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls.
He
is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway.
Oleg
films him...
MILOS
Emil???!
EMIL
Surprise!
Surprise!
Milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to TAMINA, his
comely wife.
Emil pushes his way inside.
Oleg follows.
Milos wears
plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex.
Tamina
has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished
apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace,
bracelet and big pearl earrings.
The room is furnished with
kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas.
The only anomaly is
a HUGE SONY TRINITRON HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.
(The
following is in Czech and subtitled in English.)
EMIL
Your sister said she didn't know where
you were so you shouldn't write to her
with return address if you're hiding.
MILOS
Did you hurt her?
EMIL
You know me...I never hurt anybody.
Where's the money?
OLEG
Hello, Tamina.
Oleg is looking Tamina over.
Milos - though scared - barks
at Oleg.
MILOS
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!
(to Emil)
Look.
It wasn't my fault you two were
caught.
(of Oleg)
It's his fault.
Trying to get the bank
clerk's phone number?!
I wasn't going
to wait!!!
EMIL
Milos.
Get my money!
Oleg videotapes the scene.
CLOSE ON AN AJAR DOOR
All we see behind it is a WOMAN'S FACE and her wet hair - she
obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped
around her.
MILOS
(nervously)
We spent it!
EMIL
Ha. Ha.
MILOS
Look at the way we live.
I'm a plumber.
You think I'd be working if I had
money?!
Emil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a KITCHEN
KNIFE.
He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her
throat.
MILOS (CONT'D)
Emil.
Put down the knife.
Milos looks at his wife - who is terrified.
MILOS (CONT'D)
Emil.
I'll help you.
Milos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm
him by talking softly.
MILOS (CONT'D)
I can get you a job.
EMIL
A job?
MILOS
Yes, the money is good.
EMIL
As a plumber?!
MILOS
It's easy to learn.
EMIL
A job??
As a plumber???
You think I
come to America to work!
MILOS
We started over, you can too.
EMIL
(furious)
You spent all the money while I was in
prison?
Now you tell me to get a job
fixing toilets?!?
Emil pulls the knife away from Tamina - then angrily PLUNGES
it toward Milos' chest!
Oleg videotapes it.
Then lowers the camera - shocked that
Emil killed Milos.
Blood sprays Tamina's face.
She tries to run but Oleg grabs
her, not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the
floor.
He covers her mouth as he points the videocamera at
Emil who STABS Tamina - absolutely enraged!
THE WOMAN BEHIND THE DOOR
flees...Emil hears NOISE in the bedroom - a window opening.
Emil kicks the bedroom door open.
Sees the window leading to
the fire escape.
He dashes to it.
Sees four flights down -
the WOMAN, wearing a summer dress.
Barefoot.
Her hair still
wet.
She looks up.
She is beautiful and terrified.
She runs
down the alley.
EMIL (CONT'D)
She saw!
Emil hurries toward the bathroom.
She just got out of the
shower.
Her underwear and purse are draped over a chair.
Emil grabs the purse.
Finds a CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PASSPORT.
He
opens the cover, stares at her photo and name.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Daphne Hanlova.
There's one stamp in the passport - from the U.S. when she
arrived - June 16, 1998.
Underneath is written - 6 MONTH
STAY.
Emil flips through the rest of the passport - all
blank pages.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Six month visa.
Still here two years
later.
They'll deport her if she goes
to Police.
Emil pockets Daphne's passport and wallet, scoops up her
shoes and jacket - enters the kitchen and dumps them on the
floor.
He tears through the kitchen cabinets, throwing cans
and bottles aside.
OLEG
What are you looking for?
Emil finds nail polish remover - looks at the bodies.
EMIL
I'm going to make a bohemian barbecue.
Emil draws the kitchen curtains plunging the room into
darkness.
The roof is gone.
The sky is exposed.
It's charred ruins,
smoked beams and watery muck.
Eddie and Leon are standing by
what's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's
charred bodies.
Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar,
listening to Leon.
LEON
So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine
position - that they were doin' each
other but were so whacked out of their
heads they set the pipe on the mattress,
lit it up, and they got fried.
What do
you think, Eddie?
Jordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can.
EDDIE
I don't know.
We got the experts here.
Show them what you found - I hope you
don't mind, we came over to see if we
could help.
Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the
celebrity.
KORFIN
Nah, not at all.
Detective Flemming -
Bobby Korfin.
My Uncle Tony worked with
you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
JORDY
Could you put out the cigar?
Part of
the job is picking up scents.
EDDIE
Oh, sure.
Eddie puts his cigar out.
Carefully slides it into a cigar
holder and pockets it to finish later.
LEON
Well, I found - check it out - crack
pipe.
Looks like they got careless.
Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs.
Korfin
shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe.
LEON (CONT'D)
Mind not shining that light in my eyes?
KORFIN
Sorry, bro.
JORDY
Hey, that's great you guys got it all
wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go
through the routine?
It gives us
somethin' to do.
EDDIE
No, we don't mind.
You mind Leon?
LEON
No.
Go ahead.
JORDY
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Jordy throws a look at Korfin.
Homicide detectives have no
respect for fire marshals' investigative skills.
Eddie
rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and
living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a
charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes.
KORFIN
Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got
good patterns - about thirty minutes
old.
Jordy moves to one of the corpses.
He pulls on a white
rubber glove.
Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth.
The
glove comes out white.
JORDY
Mouth's clean, too.
KORFIN
Clean?
JORDY
Don't blow your nose!
Jordy's looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose.
JORDY (CONT'D)
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils -
burn 'em out.
Let it run.
KORFIN
But you knew that, right?
Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief.
Jordy
turns back to the corpses on the bed.
Eddie - in the other
room - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor.
JORDY
So the way you see it, two crack heads
burned themselves up?
LEON
That's what it looks like to me.
JORDY
And while they're burning up, they're
still goin' down on each other?
You got
to hand it to them.
LEON
(realizes he's wrong - blows it
off)
Yeah, well, some people got their
priorities straight.
Leon watches Jordy, quietly.
With a pair of tweezers, Jordy
pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the
heads.
Korfin supplies the paint can.
Jordy drops the cloth
inside.
LEON (CONT'D)
What was that?
JORDY
Evidence.
Of a homicide.
That got Eddie's attention and he comes back to the bedroom.
JORDY (CONT'D)
You know what that is, right?
EDDIE
No, what is it?
JORDY
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.
(to a fireman joking a wall)
Hey Camello!
You mind punching a hole
in the floor?
CAMELLO
No problem.
(to Eddie and Leon)
Excuse me, gentlemen.
You might wanna
back up a little more.
Don't wanna get
your pants wet.
Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV
set.
Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon.
As Camello
hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the
bodies and Korfin explains:
KORFIN
They have not soot in their mouths,
which means they weren't breathin'
before the fire and that usually means
they were deceased - and this piece of
cloth that my partner found means they
were wrapped up in something, probably
doused with a flammable liquid and
positioned like this on the bed.
To the
untrained eye, it looks like an
accident.
Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for
something.
LEON
What's he looking for?
EDDIE
A timer.
Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up -
on the other end is a timer.
Korfin takes the timer from
Jordy and moves to Eddie.
KORFIN
Here you go.
A big double homicide.
The light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into
the room.
Emil is at the window pulling the blind down
trying to shut out the blinking light.
He pulls it down
twice and it pops back up both times.
The third time he
angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely.
He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow
behind his back.
THE ROSEANNE SHOW is on TV.
Roseanne has
been talking to a FATHER.
ROSEANNE (ON T.V.)
So you slept with your son's wife!
What's that all about?
FATHER (ON T.V.)
I take full responsibility for sleepin'
with my daughter in law.
I had low self
esteem, I thought I had to compete with
him.
Emil reaches for his dictionary.
EMIL
(mutters)
Self-esteem?
Self-esteem??
He flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self
esteem.
FATHER (ON T.V.)
Losin' my job and everything, caused my
behavioral disorder.
(turns to his son)
Forgive me, Kirk.
Let me hug you?
The audience boos.
Roseanne mediates...
Oleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed
in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera's LCD screen -
rewinding Milos' murder.
We see it now for the first time -
as he rewinds it.
Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka
between his legs.
Emil, looks up from his dictionary.
He's
wearing Milos' Rolex.
Tamina's jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl
earrings - are in front of him with Daphne's wallet.
Emil
looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera.
EMIL
(Czech)
Turn that fucking thing off!
OLEG
(Czech)
I'm not filming.
I'm watching Milos
die.
It's just like a move but realer.
Emil grabs the videocamera.
(Czech)
Don't break it!
Don't break it!
EMIL
Speak English!
OLEG
(English)
You said speak Czech!
EMIL
How you erase this?
OLEG
I'll do it.
Don't hurt my camera!
Emil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka
bottle in order to catch the camera.
Oleg, holding the
camera like it's gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away.
Emil starts to go through Daphne's wallet.
EMIL
Stupid, Milos.
I didn't want to kill
him.
(noticing)
What's this?
Emil found the last card in the wallet.
It's pink with a
picture of a busty globe.
Printed in the middle is - WORLDLY
ESCORTS - and a number.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Worldly escorts?
Emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages -
finding the meaning of worldly.
He gets up and dials the
number.
A soft, SEXY VOICE answers.
Soft music in the
background.
SEXY VOICE
Hi?
EMIL
Hello?
SEXY VOICE
Are you looking for companionship?
Oleg, who's listening, moves to Emil.
OLEG
Whore?
EMIL
I'm homesick.
You have Eastern European
girl?
A Czech girl?
SEXY VOICE
Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech
girl.
EMIL
I take her.
Send her!
The men are pulling off their equipment - coming down from
the high of fighting a fire.
Korfin and Jordy walk toward
the TV room.
The TV is on in the background.
We can see
Nicolette interviewing Eddie.
He holds up the paint can.
CHIEF DUFFY (O.S.)
What the hell is that??
You gave Eddie
Flemming the evidence?!
They turn.
DEPUTY CHIEF FIRE MARSHAL DECLAN DUFFY - the head
of the arson squad - comes over.
Duffy's tough, Irish and
very political.
DUFFY
(pointing to the TV)
Who did cause and origin?
JORDY
Who do you think, Chief?!
DUFFY
Then why didn't you talk to the
reporter?
JORDY
'Cause we got more important things to
do, like finding out who did it.
They walk to the back of the station and start up the stairs.
DUFFY
Don't you guys understand?
It's all
about image.
The better we look the
more money I get to pay you guys
overtime.
KORFIN
Yeah, right.
DUFFY
What was that, Korfin?
KORFIN
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.
As
soon as we get somethin' we'll let you
alert the media.
DUFFY
You do that, wiseguy.
Now let's solve
this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
They all head upstairs.
The Chief, Jordy and Korfin enter.
There are posters of
pyros, arsonists and terrorists on the walls.
GARCIA - a
Puerto Rican investigator - looks up from his desk.
GARCIA
Hey guys, I got your torch.
He just
gave a full confession.
A scruffy, unshaven white man sitting across from Garcia,
turns.
He is MAX, a pyromaniac in his 40's with a freshly
scratched cross etched in his forehead.
He craves attention.
MAX
It's my fire!
Screw homicide.
I'll
tell you guys everything!
Jordy moves to his desk with Korfin.
They sit across from
each other.
Duffy keeps going to his office, not even
bothering to stop.
JORDY
What's that on your forehead, Max?
That's a nice attention getter.
MAX
Yeah, I'm religious.
I'm not an Atheist
like you!
Now, are you guys gonna
arrest me, or not?
JORDY
How did you start the fire this time?
MAX
I used an accelerant.
JORDY
Yeah?
What kind?
MAX
(to Jordy)
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about
your wife leavin' you.
KORFIN
Max.
MAX
(continuing)
...Yeah, and with your old man dying
last year you - what's it?
Just you and
the dog now?
KORFIN
Max!
MAX
Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy
your ex-wife's seeing - I hear he's a
big shot downtown.
Jordy pops out of his seat.
JORDY
That's it!
You're outta here.
Jordy pulls Max by the collar - pushes him down the aisle.
MAX
That's it.
I'm suing.
KORFIN
Get in line.
Korfin takes over - throwing him out.
Jordy turns to Garcia
who is laughing.
JORDY
What's so funny.
How does he know so
much about me?
Who tells him my life
story?
GARCIA
He hangs around downstairs.
The guys
talk to him.
He's a joke...
JORDY
He's no joke!
One day he's gonna
graduate from trash can fires and do
something big.
GARCIA
Okay.
Okay.
We'll ban him from the
station.
As the "Top Story" logo is splashed across the screen,
accompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces
America's highest rated 'news magazine' show.
ROBERT HAWKINS
Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and
this is Top Story.
Tonight we bring you
an exclusive interview with Stephen
Geller - who horrified the nation two
years ago when he went berserk and
murdered three clerks in a Manhattan
shoe store.
But now, Mr. Geller's
claim, spoken softly and articulately,
is that he is the victim.
According to
Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful
day were not his fault but were the
fault of his psychiatrist.
Hard to
believe...watch.
EMIL (O.S.)
Louder.
VIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting
on the hotel bed watching the TV.
He looks at us.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Louder.
Oleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the
volume.
The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being
interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew.
He's
sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint
stained shirt.
A showing of his artwork is displayed in the
background.
Patients peruse the paintings of weird
dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact.
One of the
paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson.
STEPHEN GELLER
This had nothing to do with shoes that
didn't fit or my relationship with my
father who, as you know, made a fortune
selling penny loafers in the fifties.
These people died because of the
criminal actions of my doctor.
ROBERT HAWKINS
Your doctor?
STEPHEN GELLER
Yes.
My psychiatrist didn't insist that
I stay on my medication.
ROBERT HAWKINS
...so you feel absolutely no
responsibility for killing these people?
STEPHEN GELLER
It was my finger that pulled the
trigger, but I'm not morally
responsible.
My psychiatrist knew what
I was capable of.
How could I know.
I'm not a doctor.
ROBERT HAWKINS
You seem very savvy for a man who's been
found mentally incompetent to stand
trial.
STEPHEN GELLER
Look, I'm a victim here, too.
I was a
year away from getting my masters in
Art, now I'll never graduate.
My life
has been permanently disrupted.
ROBERT HAWKINS
Permanently disrupted?
Aren't you
selling paintings now for quite a lot of
money?
Hasn't this 'incident' as you
call it, jump started your career as an
artist?
STEPHEN GELLER
Look, I'm in here.
You call this a
career move?
ROBERT HAWKINS
And isn't there a movie in the works
about you?
STEPHEN GELLER
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
ROBERT HAWKINS
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent
criminals from profiting from their
crimes?
STEPHEN GELLER
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not
a criminal.
I'm not a criminal!
I
wasn't convicted.
Emil leans forward - listening.
Fascinated.
EMIL
I love America.
No one is responsible
for what they do.
There's a KNOCK on the door.
Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over
to it.
Then WHIPS back to Emil.
Emil looks at us.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Get in the bathroom!
OLEG (O.S.)
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
EMIL
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and
shut up!
Emil turns off the TV.
Our POV backs into the bathroom,
closing the door but leaving it open a crack.
Emil looks
down at his shoe.
The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife
sticking out of Emil's BOOT.
Emil's hands pull his pants
cuff over it.
POV PANS up to Emil as he moves to the door
and opens it.
It's not Daphne and she's not world class.
HONEY
Hi, I'm Honey.
EMIL
Where's Czech girl?
HONEY
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be.
I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm
a Czech girl.
She enters.
Closes the door behind her.
HONEY (CONT'D)
Now I like to get business out of the
way before we get down to pleasure.
Why
don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
EMIL
I ordered a Czech girl.
Daphne, you
know her?
Oleg ZOOMS in for a CLOSE UP of Honey.
During the rest of
the scene Oleg films her.
Honey begins to undress.
HONEY
It's an outcall service run out of an
apartment.
I don't meet the other
girls.
Aren't you gonna get undressed?
EMIL
Where is escort service?
HONEY
That's confidential.
Could you put the
money on the dresser?
EMIL
I like to talk to the person who runs
the service.
Can you give me address?
HONEY
Look.
Do we have a problem here?
There's no reason to have a problem.
I'm gonna make you feel real good.
You
wanna Czech girl?
After I'm done with you, you won't miss
her.
Now why don't you pay me?
She starts to unfasten Emil's belt.
EMIL
(stopping her)
Listen to me.
I don't want sex.
Just
give me the address and then you go.
HONEY
(suddenly hard as nails)
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you
want sex or not, but you're payin' for
my time.
Emil pulls the knife out of his boot and SHOVES her against
the door, PUSHING the blade against her throat - suddenly
furious like he was before killing Milos and Tamina.
EMIL
Give me the address!!
HONEY
Alright, alright - don't hurt me!
Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Emil backs off as she reaches for her purse, and comes out
with a can of mace, SPRAYING Emil's face!
Emil stumbles backwards - Oleg holding him in the frame.
He
WHIP PANS back to Honey as she grabs her clothes, unlocking
the door but Emil's HAND SLAMS it shut!
Emil turns blindly,
rubbing his burning eyes - guarding the door.
Honey darts
toward the bathroom - she pushes open the door and runs into
Oleg who is VIDEOTAPING HER.
Horrified, she turns around as
Emil SMASHES her in the face so hard she topples backwards,
tripping into the bathtub, pulling the shower curtain down on
her!
Like a panther out for the kill, Emil POUNCES.
Oleg
films as Emil lifts his hand, gripping...
THE KITCHEN KNIFE
As Emil's hand comes FLYING DOWN - then RISES UP, BLOODIED.
Her screams are muffled by the shower curtain wrapped around
her face.
Oleg films the scene as the knife plunges DOWN
INTO:
DAPHNE, a sketch of her face.
JORDY (O.S.)
Her lips are fuller than that.
You can
see 'em a mile away.
WIDER
Food containers are scattered all over the place.
The female
COMPOSITE ARTIST looks at Jordy.
Stacks of failed sketches
sit beside her.
COMPOSITE ARTIST
What about her cheek bones?
JORDY
Her cheek bones are prominent and her
eyes were huge.
Big, blue eyes and when
I saw her, she looked scared.
Like she
was looking to get away.
But she was
absolutely beautiful.
The composite artist looks at Jordy.
JORDY (CONT'D)
I gotta good look at her.
Korfin has his chair turned around from his desk and is
watching the sketch evolve as he speaks on the phone to the
landlord of the 7th Street brownstone.
Garcia is also on the
phone.
The other investigators are gone.
Working late into
the night.
Everybody's exhausted.
It's almost dawn.
KORFIN
-- From Czechoslovakia?
And how long
have they been livin' in your building?
(writes 4 YEARS on his pad)
Alright, I'll be in touch when we know
somethin'.
(to Jordy)
Milos and Tamina Karlova.
They were
quiet and kept to themselves.
Landlord
don't know who your girl is.
JORDY
How long they been livin' here?
KORFIN
You hear that question, Garcia?
GARCIA
Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone -
they've been here illegally.
KORFIN
Well, they're definitely permanent
residents now.
GARCIA
I got the owner of the plumbing company
Milos worked for.
KORFIN
Why don't we get some sleep and we'll go
see him in the morning.
JORDY
You go home.
I'm takin' your car and
goin' back to the crime scene.
KORFIN
Aren't you tired?
JORDY
If I go home I won't be able to fall
asleep anyway.
Jordy takes the sketch of Daphne which isn't a bad likeness
and heads for the door.
Korfin falls in behind him.
As they
pass Garcia he hands Jordy the address.
KORFIN
(of the picture)
She keepin' you up?
Like to meet her,
huh?
She'd make you forget your ex
wife.
Cure your insomnia.
CAMERA DESCENDS FROM THE SKY picking up Jordy as he enters
what is left of Milos and Tamina's apartment.
The roof has
been burned off. He moves into the next room, trying to see
through the darkness - looking through the muck and char.
EDDIE
Okay to smoke?
Jordy turns, surprised.
Eddie sits on a singed chair.
He
pours from a half-pint bottle of vodka into his 'won ton
soup' container, smoking a cigar.
On the arm of the armchair
is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the
crime scene and the burned bodies.
JORDY
It's your crime scene now.
You can do
what you want.
EDDIE
Watch the news?
JORDY
Nah, I musta missed it.
EDDIE
Well, just so you know.
I gave you guys
the credit.
JORDY
Well, just so you know, I don't care
about that stuff.
EDDIE
Nah, why should you?
JORDY
I don't even watch TV.
EDDIE
Good.
Good.
Commendable.
Eddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back.
JORDY
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
EDDIE
Sure.
But I would like to ask you
something.
You got a problem with me?
JORDY
If you found me steppin' on your crime
scene - it might piss you off, too.
(then)
What about the report?
EDDIE
You were right, they were both dead
before the fire.
The male was stabbed
so hard the killer broke off the tip of
the knife in his spine.
That's usually
an indicator of something personal.
Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne.
Hands it to Eddie.
JORDY
The Super said he'd seen her before but
she didn't live here.
EDDIE
Pretty.
JORDY
(acts as if he didn't notice)
Hmmmm.
EDDIE
Maybe you don't care about that either.
(beat)
Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
JORDY
Who says she's a suspect?
Jordy tries to take the sketch back.
Eddie holds on.
EDDIE
What would you call her?
JORDY
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything
to do with this.
I saw her outside
after the fire - thought it was a lead.
Maybe she saw something.
Maybe she was
visiting somebody here.
Who knows?
Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were.
EDDIE
Obviously they weren't having sex.
As
you pointed out.
So why go through all
the trouble of putting 'em like that?
Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy.
JORDY
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone
trying to send a message.
Burial rites
are taken very seriously in Eastern
Europe.
It could be to humiliate them.
Just burning them up, no proper funeral,
it's like condemning them to hell.
EDDIE
Eastern Europe.
Like what?
Romania?
Hungary?
JORDY
Or Czechoslovakia.
The Slavs have been
fighting the Germans and the Russians
for a thousand years.
These are very
intense people and they take things
personally.
Eddie's cellular rings - he grabs it.
EDDIE
Yeah?
Where?
You sure it was a knife?
Uh-huh.
Really?
Okay.
(to Jordy)
We've got another murder - in a hotel on
Eighth Avenue.
A stabbing.
Clerk said
the room was rented by a Russian...
Eddie's moving with Daphne's sketch.
JORDY
I'll come with you.
EDDIE
There wasn't a fire.
There'll be
nothing for you to do.
JORDY
I can watch you, Eddie.
Maybe I'll
learn something.
EDDIE
This isn't homicide school.
JORDY
My parents are from Poland.
I can help
with the Eastern European angle.
EDDIE
You're Polish?
JORDY
My folks are.
EDDIE
Stay here.
The hotel room is a hive of activity.
GIL is dusting the
dresser for prints.
Another officer is stripping the bed and
putting the bedding into a big, clear plastic bag.
As Eddie
enters the crime scene, a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is standing in
the doorway taking pictures.
EDDIE
Where is she?
LEON
Takin' a bath.
EDDIE
Any I.D.?
LEON
Still unknown but we're running prints.
Kid over there caught the case.
Jordy enters.
Leon steps in his way.
LEON (CONT'D)
Sorry...PD only.
EDDIE
It's okay.
Eddie walks over to a young detective.
TOMMY CULLEN, only
26, is excited to meet Eddie.
TOMMY
Tommy Cullen.
Heard a lot about you.
Nice to meet you.
Here's what we got.
A girl in there, figure her to be a
prostitute, looks like she was fighting
for her life.
She's got defense wounds
on her hands.
Right this way - in the
bathroom.
EDDIE
After you.
Eddie follows Tommy into the bathroom.
There's blood
splattered all over the walls and the floor.
Honey's topless
body lies in the tub tangled in the bloody shower curtain.
MURPHY, an Irish medical examiner (M.E.), is examining the
body.
TOMMY
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
JORDY
Capra?
That's not Czech or Russian.
Who said he sounded Russian?
TOMMY
The clerk?
EDDIE
Check the switchboard, see what phone
calls were made from this room.
TOMMY
I'll do it.
Tommy heads out.
Eddie takes out his cigar holder.
Slides
out what's left of his cigar.
Re-lights it.
Looks down at
Honey's body in the bathtub.
Gil's dusting the tub for
prints.
MURPHY
Clothes were off in the other room.
Tub
is dry except for the blood.
EDDIE
Any of you guys take a piss lately?
Gil looks confused.
Eddie points to the toilet.
Seat is up.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Do the seat for me.
Gil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it.
Eddie
stands in the bathroom - studying the scene.
Holding the
unlit cigar.
Looking around at the blood splattered walls.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Only one guys checked in?
LEON
Yeah.
EDDIE
C'mere.
You wanna go to homicide
school?
Here - make yourself useful.
Eddie positions Jordy behind the tub next to the wall.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Our killer...our killer's standing here
slashing at her.
She's fightin' him.
The blood is splattering this way.
It's
on this wall...
(pointing to the right of
Jordy)
And there's some specks over here.
(to the left of Jordy)
There's nothing here because someone was
standing right here.
Someone big.
And
he's got blood on him.
Lots of blood.
He wouldn't walk out of here like that.
(turning to Murphy)
Murphy, what kind of knife you think
we're talking about here?
Murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the
blood-splattered wall.
MURPHY
If you look here where he missed and hit
the wall you see that the marks aren't
deep but they're kinda wide... not your
everyday kitchen or pocket knife.
EDDIE
What if the tip was broken off?
MURPHY
Could be.
Then we should find it here
somewhere.
EDDIE
I think we've already found it.
Eddie exchanges a look with Jordy as Tommy, the young
detective, returns.
TOMMY
There was only one call from this room
last night.
I dialed it.
It's an
escort service.
LEON
Did you identify yourself?
TOMMY
Hey, I'm new but I'm not stupid.
EDDIE
Call communications and get an address
on that number.
Tommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service
address on it.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Good work.
Jordy hurries out - catches up with Eddie.
JORDY
You goin' to the escort service?
EDDIE
You got any better ideas?
JORDY
Mind if I ride along with you?
EDDIE
This has nothing to do with your fire.
JORDY
But what if it does?
You might need my
help.
As Eddie exits the hotel, a MAN approaches.
MAN
Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for
my son?
Eddie and Jordy arrive in front of Rose's door.
Eddie knocks
and flips a coin to Jordy.
EDDIE
Oh here.
A souvenir.
Jordy takes the quarter.
Not understanding what Eddie means.
He looks at the quarter.
JORDY
Two heads.
EDDIE
Better than one.
Eddie suckered him with the coin toss.
Jordy reacts.
Eddie
laughs - squirts Binaca in his mouth.
Knocks again.
We hear
ROSE HELLER.
ROSE (O.S.)
Who's there?
EDDIE
Police.
We'd like to ask you a few
questions.
ROSE (O.S.)
I have nothin' to say.
If you wanna
contact my attorney...
EDDIE
(commands)
Homicide, Miss Hearn.
It's Detective
Eddie Flemming.
Open up.
Rose reacts.
Immediately UNLOCKS, UNCHAINS and opens the
door!
ROSE
You!
I've seen you on TV!
Eddie glances self-consciously at Jordy.
ROSE (CONT'D)
C'mon in.
C'mon in!
They enter.
ROSE
Just a minute.
Shit.
And I don't have
a camera.
Hold on a second.
Rose moves back to the phone - finishes up her conversation
in Afrikaner.
We hold on Eddie and Jordy at the door.
Eddie
looks around - taking in the place.
FOUR GIRLS are on
phones.
Two girls take orders for customers.
The other two
work the phone sex lines.
Rose hangs up the phone - turns to
Eddie and Jordy:
ROSE (CONT'D)
What's wrong?
EDDIE
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of
your girls was killed last night at the
King Edward Hotel.
ROSE
Oh my G-d.
Honey!
Honey's dead?
JORDY
Do you remember the man who called?
Though Rose answers Jordy, she directs her response to Eddie.
ROSE
Yeah.
He wanted a girl from
Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey
'cause once they get there, you know, it
doesn't really matter - Honey was
killed...?
Poor girl...
EDDIE
Do you have any Czech girls working for
you?
ROSE
No.
EDDIE
Did you tell him you did?
A BUTCH GIRL enters.
Rose speaks to her in Afrikaner.
ROSE
(Afrikaner)
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
EDDIE
What are you saying?
ROSE
Daphne.
Another guy came in asking me
about her, too.
Jordy pulls out the sketch, unfolds it.
JORDY
This her?
ROSE
Yeah.
Sort of.
I tried to recruit her,
gave her my card.
She said she'd think
about it but I never heard from her.
BUTCH GIRL
(Afrikaner)
Beautiful eyes.
EDDIE
Who came by looking for her?
ROSE
He said he was her cousin.
I told him
where she works.
They were just here.
EDDIE
Describe him.
ROSE
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.
Second
guy with him was...shorter, with a
wrestler's build.
And he wouldn't turn
his videocamera off me.
EDDIE
He had a videocamera?
Where is she?
Quickly!
ROSE
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon
on 63rd and Madison.
Jordy holds on as Eddie darts in and out of cars with
astonishing dexterity.
This man can drive.
Eddie picks up
his phone - dials.
Jordy is on his cell phone as well.
EDDIE
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison.
Hair salon.
Ludwig's.
JORDY
(overlapping)
I'm on my way with Eddie.
Ludwig's.
63rd and Madison.
The suspects might be
there already.
Eddie looks over as Jordy disconnects.
Eddie picks up a beer
he was holding between his legs - finishes it.
EDDIE
You thirsty?
JORDY
I'm on duty.
EDDIE
(drinking)
So am I.
Alright, I'll go inside and
you cover the back.
JORDY
Of course.
EDDIE
Hey!
I always wanted to be a cop when I
was a kid.
I dreamed of running up to a
door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and
yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy!
What'd you dream about?
JORDY
I wanted to run up to a building on
fire, kick in the door, rush into the
smoke and save a kid.
EDDIE
Then I guess we're doin' this the right
way, aren't we?
If we pull up to a
burning building I'll gladly let you go
first.
Jordy looks at Eddie - can't deny he's right.
We're in a moving video POV of Ludwig's, the hair salon -
it's big and spacious.
The lens finds THE RECEPTIONIST.
OLEG (O.S.)
Daphne Handlova?
RECEPTIONIST
Daphne?
In the back.
Probably
shampooing a customer's hair.
Oleg approaches Daphne who is mixing hair dye.
LUDWIG, the
owner, is with her.
LUDWIG
Why are you messing with your hair color
again?
You're going to kill your hair.
You won't look good with black hair.
DAPHNE
I want to do it, alright?
LUDWIG
Well, then do it after work.
A
customer's waiting.
He leaves, a customer approaches.
She smiles at him - turns
on the water in the sink then sees - Oleg filming her.
She
backs up...suddenly moves to the emergency door!
TO THE BACKYARD
There's a garden out there.
Daphne runs toward the alley.
Oleg follows her - still videotaping.
As she rounds the
corner she bumps into...Emil!
He pulls out his kitchen
knife, shoving her against the wall, pushing the blade with
the broken tip against her throat.
EMIL
I...I have a temper.
She looks at him, not understanding.
Oleg films the scene.
EMIL (CONT'D)
When I lose it, I lose control.
I
didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole
from me.
Cheated me!
When I went to
prison, they beat me.
I still didn't
tell he was my partner.
I loved Milos
like a brother...
The tone in Emil's voice - there's an uncharacteristic
softness to it.
He wants to reconcile his behavior to her.
EMIL (CONT'D)
(in English)
I'm not a killer.
The back door opens.
He shoves the knife in his pocket as
Ludwig peers around the alleyway.
What he sees is Emil
leaning close to Daphne, kissing her.
LUDWIG
Daphne, will you be coming back to work?
DAPHNE
In a minute, Ludwig.
Ludwig leaves.
EMIL
Smart girl.
I'm glad you're not a
whore.
But washing hair?
This is no
job for a woman as beautiful as you.
They should be washing your hair.
Emil reaches into his pocket and pulls out SOMETHING, sticks
it in the palm of her hand, closing her fingers around it.
EMIL (CONT'D)
I don't want to kill you.
But if you
talk, I will.
(whispers)
I thought you'd want these.
He taps her hand...he turns and goes out the rear exit.
Oleg
follows.
Jordy arrives.
JORDY
...Daphne?
She says nothing.
JORDY (CONT'D)
I'm a fire marshal.
You remember me
from the other night?
You are Daphne,
right?
She says nothing.
Eddie arrives.
Daphne turns.
Recognizing
Eddie.
EDDIE
You don't have to be afraid.
We're here
to protect you.
Come with me.
We want
to talk to you.
You speak English
alright?
Eddie looks at Jordy.
Takes Daphne by the arm.
Jordy talks to Daphne.
DAPHNE
I told your partner, I can't help.
I
didn't see anything.
EDDIE
C'mon, start at the beginning.
You know
these people?
DAPHNE
Tamina was a friend of mine.
My shower
was broken, she let me use theirs.
EDDIE
Go on.
She says nothing.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find
out.
Better if it comes from you.
DAPHNE
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
EDDIE
Arrest you for what?
Why would we
arrest you?
She still hesitates.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
What are you hiding?
Why are you afraid
JORDY
She just saw two of her friends killed!
They probably threatened her.
EDDIE
Is that all there is?
She looks at Eddie.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Are you here illegally?
Don't worry
about that.
We'll talk to Immigration.
They won't deport you.
DAPHNE
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
She clams up.
JORDY
Why not?
EDDIE
Something back home?
Jordy leads Daphne to a table - she sits.
Eddie sits across
from her.
Jordy crouches down next to her.
DAPHNE
...my little sister and I shared a flat -
I came home one night and a man was
raping her.
His gun was on the chair...
He came at me and I shot him.
JORDY
(optimistic)
Alright.
That's a justifiable homicide.
DAPHNE
Yes, but he was a cop.
EDDIE
A cop?
DAPHNE
(beat)
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.
Like
the South here.
The Police is right, a
civilian is wrong.
So I fled.
EDDIE
Look, we can help you but right now we
have to deal with what's happening here.
Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
DAPHNE
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
JORDY
(to Eddie)
Can I talk to you?
Eddie steps away with Jordy.
Keeping his eyes on Daphne.
She tries to listen.
EDDIE
She's fucked.
Even if that story is
true.
JORDY
Raw deal.
Eddie tilts his head.
Measures Jordy.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Look - let me talk to her.
Any leads I
get, they're all yours.
Just let me
have a first crack at her.
EDDIE
You wanna talk to her alone?
JORDY
Yeah.
EDDIE
What would your girlfriend think of
that?
JORDY
I don't have a girlfriend.
EDDIE
My point exactly.
JORDY
I'm serious here.
EDDIE
So am I.
JORDY
C'mon.
You intimidate her 'cause you're
a celebrity.
She sees me differently.
EDDIE
You're her Savior?
Is she the kid
you're gonna save from the burning
building?
JORDY
You know what I'm saying here.
Eddie looks at his watch.
Thinks it over.
Measures Jordy.
EDDIE
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a
head start.
You take her to the station
house.
Don't let her out of your sight.
She's the only warm body we got left.
JORDY
Hey.
I'm a professional.
EDDIE
Women like that have a way of turning
professionals into amateurs.
He gives Jordy a look and heads for the door.
Emil pulls off his sock and shoe, lifts his foot into a
stained sink and washes the blood away, exposing the chunk of
pink flesh taken out of his ankle.
Emil grabs some toilet
paper, plugs the wound, then cuts the towel off the dispenser
with his kitchen knife and wraps his ankle.
He grits teeth
in pain.
The lights go out.
Then Oleg adjusts the
fluorescent light above the sink.
OLEG
Gotta light the scene better.
Now it's
more moody... like a scene from THE
THIRD MAN.
EMIL
Shut up.
OLEG
Does it hurt?
Emil lifts his foot out of the sink.
EMIL
This is nothing.
Emil lifts his shirt, exposing his back.
OLEG
Oh, shit.
I hate looking at that!
EMIL
Don't want to film this?
We don't see what Oleg sees - not yet - but from his
expression, it's horrible.
Daphne rides in the backseat.
Jordy's watching her in the
rearview.
DAPHNE
Now I become custody of police
department?
JORDY
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe
they'll help you with your situation.
DAPHNE
I will if they don't send me back.
JORDY
They won't until this is over.
She looks away.
Out the window.
Jordy sees emotion filling
her eyes.
She looks back at him - her eyes have teared up.
DAPHNE
Are you married?
JORDY
Divorced.
DAPHNE
Do you live alone?
(beat)
I've been in these clothes since...the
killings.
Could we stop at your place?
I could take a shower...before I go into
custody?
Jordy looks at her.
Can't quite tell if she's trying to
manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before
all the shit starts.
JORDY
I can't take you to my place.
DAPHNE
Somewhere else?
Jordy looks at her...
EDDIE
Staring right at us.
EDDIE
I want to talk to you about something
serious.
He holds up the diamond engagement ring.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
I want to live the rest of my life with
you...I don't know you've been married
before and I've never been married, but
I do love you, and...
Eddie is standing in front of a mirror - rehearsing the
proposal.
He notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff.
Leon's blood.
Paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka
tonic.
PAULIE
She's here.
Paulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual.
He hands Eddie the towel.
Eddie wipes off his face and
hands, then hands the towel back to Paulie.
Paulie helps
Eddie on with his coat.
Eddie takes some Visine out of his
coat pocket.
Drops a few in each eye.
HE straightens
himself and looks in the mirror, taking a big gulp of the
drink.
Eddie sets the glass down and starts out.
Paulie
hands him a Binaca.
Eddie gives himself a squirt as he
exits.
Paulie follows.
It's lunchtime...it's crowded.
Eddie takes a seat at a
table.
He takes the ring out of his pocket - holds it under
the table.
Nicolette Karas walks up to Eddie from behind.
Gives him a kiss on the cheek.
NICOLETTE
Hey, honey.
EDDIE
Hey.
She orders a drink in Greek from the Greek waiter, then sits
down across the table.
There's a long pause - they just look
at each other.
NICOLETTE
What is your problem?
Why'd you snap at
me?
I just wanted a statement.
EDDIE
I can't...I can't answer you just
because you want me to answer you!
NICOLETTE
You didn't have to embarrass me in front
of my colleagues.
You could give me
something.
EDDIE
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I embarrass you,
sweetheart?
Oh...
NICOLETTE
Stop it.
EDDIE
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to
the cameras and say, do you mind if we
just work something out?
NICOLETTE
Alright, alright, Eddie.
Don't
patronize me.
EDDIE
I'm not.
NICOLETTE
Yes you are.
I'm not just some
reporter.
I don't just stick a
microphone in your face.
You could give
me something.
EDDIE
Yeah, well you took the camera and put
it right down on the evidence.
That
was...
NICOLETTE
That was good.
You were holding the
evidence.
EDDIE
You were merciless.
You didn't give a
shit if you got me or not.
NICOLETTE
Well, who was it that taught me how to
do that?
Huh?
EDDIE
You're ruthless.
NICOLETTE
You're not so bad yourself.
They look at each other.
NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
C'mere.
They kiss.
NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
Look at this.
You have blood on your
shirt.
Whose is it?
EDDIE
Could be Leon's.
NICOLETTE
Jesus.
And last week you came over with
blood on your shoes.
What am I going to
do with you?
Eddie takes her hand.
EDDIE
You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes
might look nice with another pair of
shoes next to them in the closet.
She looks at him.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
You know, Nicky, I've been married twice
before.
My first wife was a
professional woman, didn't have time for
children.
My second wife...I never
wanted to go home to her.
Nicolette's phone rings.
Eddie stops - looks at the ringing
phone.
NICOLETTE
What are you doing?
What are you
saying?
Nicolette's phone keeps ringing.
Eddie stares at it.
NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
Eddie?
Nicolette's phone keeps ringing.
NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
Don't worry about the damn phone.
I
won't answer it.
EDDIE
Answer the phone.
NICOLETTE
No.
Tell me what you want to say.
EDDIE
Answer it.
NICOLETTE
Okay.
Okay.
Hold that thought just for
a second.
They only call me when it's
an emergency.
Just hold that thought.
(into the phone)
Can you call back?
PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
We need you here in twenty minutes.
Get
in a cab.
NICOLETTE
What're you talking about?
PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
Katie.
We don't know where she is.
We
can't find her.
You gotta anchor the
5:00.
This is your shot.
Come now.
NICOLETTE
What?
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah.
The line disconnects.
She collapses the phone.
Turns to
Eddie.
NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.
They
want me to anchor tonight!
EDDIE
That's good.
NICOLETTE
Yeah.
EDDIE
Well, that's great.
NICOLETTE
Okay.
That is great.
But I can't go
now, we're in the middle of something
here.
EDDIE
No.
Go ahead.
You're gonna be great.
NICOLETTE
No.
No, listen to me here.
I want to
know what you're talking about.
You
know, the shoe thing and the marriages
and...
EDDIE
I'll tell you tonight.
Let's do it
tonight.
As soon as you get back we'll
talk.
We'll talk.
NICOLETTE
Promise?
EDDIE
I promise.
We'll talk.
You'll be
great.
You'll be fine.
Go ahead, just
imagine that, uh... Just look into the
lens and imagine you're talking to me.
NICOLETTE
Yeah.
I'll do that.
As long as you're
not patronizing me.
EDDIE
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
NICOLETTE
I love you.
They kiss.
NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
Okay, til tonight.
EDDIE
Tonight.
NICOLETTE
You promise?
EDDIE
Yeah.
I promise.
NICOLETTE
Okay.
And you know what, I'll swing by
my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes
and maybe just test them out next to
yours...How's that... Would that be a
good thing.
EDDIE
Yeah, yeah.
Good thing.
NICOLETTE
Okay.
EDDIE
See you later.
Good luck.
NICOLETTE
Thank you.
EDDIE
Don't be late.
She walks out.
Jordy unlocks the door.
Enters with Daphne.
The fire
station is empty.
JORDY
The men are out of quarters - practicing
putting out fires.
DAPHNE
So...the station is empty?
JORDY
Yeah.
This way.
He gestures toward the stairs.
Jordy and Daphne walk through the locker room.
Her eyes
never leaving Jordy's.
JORDY
You considered becoming a prostitute?
DAPHNE
Yes, I considered it.
JORDY
Did you ever turn tricks before?
DAPHNE
No.
JORDY
What about back home?
DAPHNE
No.
Daphne stops.
Looks at him.
Stands very close.
DAPHNE (CONT'D)
I came here.
I had no money.
I knew no
one.
I couldn't get a job because you
have to have a green card to get work.
They approached me - I could've made a
lot of money.
I considered it, but...
it's not who I am.
They pay me below
the table at Ludwig's.
JORDY
So you were never a prostitute?
DAPHNE
What are you asking me?
JORDY
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
She looks up into his eyes.
Searching.
Thinking he's
hinting.
DAPHNE
Can you let me go?
She leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to
kiss her.
Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie's warning
and backs up slightly.
JORDY
Showers are this way.
Desperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even
closer.
DAPHNE
You could shower with me.
Jordy is locked in her eyes.
Almost giving in.
Then breaks
away.
Gestures towards the showers.
Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen.
She heads to the
showers.
Jordy follows her into the bathroom.
The walls are
lined with shower stalls.
JORDY
I'll uh, I'll get you a towel.
He leaves her there.
Alone.
She quickly moves to the
window.
Opens it.
Looks down.
It's a two-story drop to the
street.
JORDY
gets a towel from the locker room.
His beeper goes off.
He
checks the number but decides not to return the call.
We
follow him back into the bathroom.
The shower is on but he
notices the window.
It's open.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Shit!
He rushes over.
He looks out.
No sign of her.
He turns -
looks back at the shower.
It's on but he can't see through
the curtain.
Can't tell if she's there.
He walks over -
quickly - fearing that she's left.
He pulls the curtain
aside.
She's crouched in the corner shower stall.
Holding
herself.
She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Are you alright?
Jordy sits on the bench next to the shower.
DAPHNE
I'm not a whore.
I'm not a whore.
JORDY
I know.
DAPHNE
You don't know.
I'm sorry.
I was
desperate.
That's not me.
I shot a
cop.
Can you imagine what they'll do to
me when I got to prison?
JORDY
They're not gonna send you right back.
DAPHNE
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...I'm glad.
Actually I'm glad it's over.
All this
time.
Hiding.
Never being able to look
anyone in the eyes.
Always afraid that someone would find
out who I was.
Never trusting anyone...
He covers her with the towel, pulling her up.
JORDY
You can trust me.
She embraces him.
Trusting him.
He stands there for a
moment.
Then awkwardly holds her.
Comforting her.
CLOSE UP
on a steak.
Male hands cut a piece.
Another male hand sets
down a huge bottle of Extra Strength Excedrin.
The hands
abandon the steak and rip open the bottle.
The CAMERA pulls
back to include the LCD screen of Oleg's videocamera.
He is
taping Emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his
teeth.
Emil is sweating with fever and his eyes are glazed
over in pain.
He 'drinks' pills from the bottle and chews
them up.
Wincing in pain.
Emil washes them down with a
beer.
Emil looks down and the camera follows his gaze to the
"People" magazine article he's reading on Stephen Geller.
Emil laughs.
Shaking his head at the article as the
videocamera tilts back up to his face.
OLEG
What is it?
EMIL
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told
you to erase it.
OLEG
I did.
EMIL
And the whore's murder?
You didn't
erase that either, did you?
Don't lie,
I won't be angry.
OLEG
Why not?
EMIL
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Oleg closes the LCD screen and puts the camera down.
Emil
removes a small address book -- from Leon's wallet - he looks
up Eddie Flemming's name.
OLEG
What is that?
EMIL
What does it look like?
It's an address
book!
Oleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book.
OLEG
Let me get a shot of it.
EMIL
Sit down!
OLEG
This way.
Hold it this way.
Good.
Oleg gets a shot and quickly sits back down.
OLEG (CONT'D)
Why won't you be angry at me for keeping
my movie?
Emil takes a gulp of beer - drops cash on the table and limps
away.
Oleg follows.
It's quiet - Chief Duffy paces in front of the Sergeant's
desk.
Looking at his watch.
Growing more and more
aggravated as every second ticks by.
Jordy enters escorting
Daphne.
Sees Duffy and tires to go past him.
Duffy turns
and sees Jordy and Daphne.
DUFFY
Hey.
Warsaw.
Jordy stops and comes back.
Sitting Daphne down on a bench.
JORDY
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
DUFFY
I came to see how the investigation was
going.
(looks at Daphne)
I called and you're not here.
I wait up
at the station and you don't even show
up!!!
I beep you - you don't return my
call.
Where the hell have you been?!
Jordy takes a few steps away from Daphne.
JORDY
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training.
We stopped there... so she could get
cleaned up.
DUFFY
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
JORDY
I let her take a shower.
DUFFY
A shower!?
Did you take one, too?
JORDY
No!
Nothing happened.
DUFFY
Oh really.
That's nice.
You took a
homicide witness to take a shower after
your partner was shot?
Are you out of
your fucking mind??
Are you having that
much trouble gettin' dates?!
EDDIE (O.S.)
I told him to take her there.
Jordy and Duffy turn.
Eddie walks out.
Eddie turns - Tommy -
the young detective who caught the case in the King Edward
Hotel - is coming out of the back office.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Tommy, get her outta here.
Tommy takes Daphne into the precinct.
TOMMY
This way, ma'am.
EDDIE
There was too much press hangin' around
there.
I didn't want her face on the
news.
So I told him to take her to a
quiet area until things settled down.
DUFFY
Oh.
EDDIE
It was my decision, not his.
DUFFY
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall
and every now and then I'd like to be
included in decisions.
EDDIE
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do
the press conference.
How about that?
The case is all yours.
DUFFY
Oh yeah...?
Alright.
EDDIE
(to Jordy)
I'm ready to be briefed.
(to Duffy)
Excuse us.
DUFFY
(to Eddie)
Yeah, sure.
(to Jordy)
Beep me when you're ready for the press
conference.
JORDY
Will do, Chief.
Eddie leads the way, walking past the Sergeant's desk -
toward the back and to his office.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Eddie, I...
Eddie holds up his hand - silencing Jordy.
EDDIE
Wait.
A handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee.
Eddie enters with Jordy.
EDDIE
Guys...give me a few minutes?
They empty out.
JORDY
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't
touch her.
EDDIE
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna
believe you didn't...including me.
JORDY
I took her there for a shower and that's
it.
EDDIE
Just a shower?
Eddie gives Jordy a questioning look.
JORDY
Yeah, just her in the shower.
Nothing
happened.
Look, I'm sure you probably
think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
EDDIE
No, I don't think you were a fool, I
just think you were stupid about it.
I
mean, to say the least, you outta know
better.
You don't know her well enough.
She's got the potential to fucking hang
you even if she suggests that you made a
pass at her, it's fuckin' over.
You can
deny it all you want, but it will not
make one fucking bit of difference.
You're dead.
JORDY
I told you, you know, I thought I was
doing the right thing, you know, I think
she's innocent.
EDDIE
Well, it's not up to you to decide
whether she's innocent or not.
Don't
you understand, that's why you're a
professional.
JORDY
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a
limb for somebody?
I mean, you shoulda
heard her there.
Tellin' her whole
story...I believed her.
EDDIE
How you go out on a limb for somebody is
by giving her a number of an Immigration
lawyer.
Here, here's a number of an
Immigration lawyer.
That's how you help
her.
But you can't get involved in her like
that.
You're gonna jeopardize your
career, your life and you're gonna
jeopardize my case.
And lemme give you
another piece of advice.
Maybe you
don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a
little secret - the whole fuckin' world
watches television.
And when you get
out there, they know your face.
And the
little fame, the little fuckin' itty
bitty fame that I get in this city makes
it a lot easier for my job.
And I get
more done because of it.
Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat.
JORDY
Why'd you help me back there with the
Chief?
Why'd you stand up for me like
that?
EDDIE
You know, I don't know.
I like you.
You remind me of a puppy I used to have.
He pissed on the rug all the time, but I
still kept him.
Eddie picks up his cigar that's going out.
He sticks it in
his mouth.
A match is lit.
He looks up.
Jordy holds the
match.
Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs.
The
homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look.
Eddie walks in - carrying flowers.
He closes and locks the
door behind him.
He grabs the phone.
Dials.
EDDIE
It's Flemming...anything turn up?
Did
they check the hospitals?
Airports?
Yeah, I hit him!
I fuckin' hit him!
We
should be all over everywhere - with
dogs, choppers, everything!
These guys
are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia...
He looks at the flowers.
Decides to put the case behind him
for a moment.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
I'll call you later.
He HANGS up.
Arranges the flowers in a vase.
So they look
perfect.
Sets them on the coffee table.
Fills out a card,
writes, "Nicky, I love you.
Will you marry me?"
He sticks the card in the flowers -
turns the lights down low.
Puts a romantic Sinatra song on
the stereo.
Moves to the liquor cabinet.
Pours himself a
drink.
He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to the
flowers.
There's a knock at the door.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Coming!
Eddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door.
But the hallway is
empty.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Nicky!?!?
No answer.
Eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in
his hand.
Walks toward the elevator.
Doesn't notice the
shadow that passes behind him - entering his apartment.
Eddie turns.
No sign of anyone.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Nicky?!
He walks back toward his apartment.
Turns and locks the
door.
A BLUR jumps out of the shadows SLAMMING him on the
head with a gun.
Eddie tumbles to the floor!
OUT COLD!
A BLURRED VIDEO IMAGE
as it's focused - on Eddie - handcuffed and upper body taped
to a chair - 20 minutes later - sobered up.
Emil is sitting
in front of him.
On the coffee table alongside him are the
flowers in a vase.
They've ransacked the place.
Emil has
Eddie's watch, his gold shield and his money.
He's smoking
one of Eddie's cigars and in Emil's hand...is the diamond
engagement ring and card.
Oleg, 60 MINUTES-style, is
positioned behind Emil videotaping Eddie.
He moves to the
corner of the room - bringing a light back over to illuminate
Eddie's face.
EMIL
So...who's Nicky?
EDDIE
What do you want?
EMIL
Your opinion.
(leaning forward)
You see, they going to make a movie
about me, too, Eddie.
And write books.
EDDIE
(sarcastic)
What's your accomplishment.
EMIL
I kill someone famous.
EDDIE
Then do it, asshole.
EMIL
Good - be tough to the end.
Actor who
plays you will want to die like hero.
Eddie looks at the videocamera.
Emil answers Eddie's look.
EMIL (CONT'D)
So tabloids don't have to do re
enactments.
They going to have real
movie this time.
EDDIE
If you kill me and film it you're
putting a noose around your neck.
Emil turns to Oleg.
EMIL
Turn it off.
Oleg obeys.
Emil turns to Eddie.
EMIL (CONT'D)
No.
We are insane.
Who else but crazy
men would film their murders?
(gestures to Eddie)
So we kill someone famous and if we are
caught, we are sent to mental hospital.
But what good is money there?
Because
once in hospital I say I not crazy.
Just pretended to be acquitted.
We see
psychiatrists.
They must certify we are
sane and because of your - what is law
called?
(Eddie says nothing)
Oh - I got it.
Because of your Double
Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same
crime twice.
We come out free, rich and
famous!
OLEG
Good idea!
EDDIE
You really think you'll be able to fool
a jury with this bullshit?
How fuckin'
stupid are you?
EMIL
Smarter than Americans.
You're fed cry
baby talk shows all day long.
Not only
will Americans believe me, they'll cry
for me.
(laughs)
So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you
like to say goodbye to your Nicolette?
Maybe you can propose to her now?
Eddie says nothing.
Just stares at Emil.
Emil puffs on
Eddie's cigar.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Okay.
He has nothing to say.
(signaling Oleg)
Start the camera!
OLEG
Cut!
Emil looks at Oleg.
OLEG (CONT'D)
This is my project.
I say 'action.'
I
am the director!
You are the talent.
You wait for me to say 'action!'
Emil looks at Eddie as if to say, "See what I have to put up
with."
Oleg gestures from behind the videocamera.
OLEG (CONT'D)
And...action!
Oleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie's service revolver.
Eddie
suddenly KICKS at Emil's hand, but Emil pulls it away,
backing out of Eddie's reach.
EMIL
Bad last moment - I cut that out.
Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie's
left temple.
Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the
gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm.
Standing
and following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over
into the desk.
Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and
Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor.
Oleg still grips the videocamera.
Eddie continues around
with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning
him to the wall.
Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as
Emil is limping for it.
Eddie knocks Emil out of the way
with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair
repeatedly.
Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him
from the wall.
Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and
onto the sofa.
Falling on top of him, rolling over and
leaving Oleg on the sofa.
Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair
in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the
gun.
Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is
not clear in the darkness who has the gun.
Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the
videocamera.
Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up
as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting
toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the
window and one of the lampshades off the lamp.
Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn
toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in
the stomach.
Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S
STOMACH.
Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to
the chair - holding the gun.
Eddie can't believe he got
stabbed.
Blood swells around his stomach.
He can't be
dying.
This can't be happening.
He looks at Emil.
The pain
is terrible.
Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a
close up.
Emil looks at Eddie.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Die.
Die.
Emil looks around.
Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie
off, suffocating him.
BLACKNESS
We are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you
feel is the motion.
We are travelling very fast.
Finally,
in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame.
We slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a
tiny pixel on a TV screen.
WIDENING
further out we see Eddie's funeral on the evening news.
It's
an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and
dignitaries.
In the upper right hand corner, superimposed
over the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in
his NYPD uniform.
We see Oleg's reflection on the set with
the videocamera.
He is filming the TV.
We hear the audio
from Eddie's funeral.
NEWSCASTER (ON T.V.)
..Detective Flemming was one of the most
decorated NYPD detectives in the history
of New York.
He made several thousand
arrests during his career, including the
famed Stephen Geller case.
Beloved by
the community in which he served.
His
partner eulogized him...
Leon is at the mic.
LEON (ON T.V.)
...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend
and my partner...he taught me the
meaning of the word 'cop.'
He was a man
in every sense of the word.
I'll miss
him...
(choking on tears)
Sleep well, brother.
Leon begins to sing "Amazing Grace."
Oleg PANS from the TV
and focuses it on a lightbulb.
Hands enter the frame -
carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray.
A long
hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is
pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid.
Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb.
Again,
the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a
table...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE.
VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT
revealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this.
It's packed with COPS drinking.
Prosecutors...lawyers...many
who were at the funeral, including Leon.
All wear the black
ribbon on their badges.
There's a quality of an Irish wake -
boisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform.
A buffet
has been laid out.
Hawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon.
He
greets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon.
HAWKINS
Awful...what an awful day.
He was New
York City.
Hawkins notices a young man by the window.
Teary-eyed.
It's
Tommy.
Hawkins nods to him.
TOMMY
I never got to tell him how much I
admired him.
HAWKINS
I know, son, I know.
We all loved him.
Hawkins moves on...greeting others.
He notices at the end of
the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette.
He moves
to her.
Pulls up a stool alongside her.
She turns, looks at
him.
Just stares at him for a long beat.
She is bombed.
Definitely drunk.
She's had many.
She turns to Hawkins.
NICOLETTE
You know...you know he was gonna propose
to me.
The crime guys found a card he'd
written out to me.
And a ring
box...these fuckers that killed him -
have my ring.
They have my diamond
engagement ring...
Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion.
HAWKINS
I know.
NICOLETTE
What do you mean you know?
He told you
he was gonna propose to me?
HAWKINS
Well, he...
NICOLETTE
(overriding)
I want to hear everything he said.
HAWKINS
I'm trying to tell you.
NICOLETTE
Alright.
Go ahead.
HAWKINS
That morning.
He was talking to me and
Leon about marriage.
NICOLETTE
Oh my G-d.
We were having lunch here.
He started making overtures - talking
about little shoes next to his in his
closet but I got a call to anchor - and
I walked out on him.
I walked out on
him when he was trying to ask me to
marry him!!
Nicolette is crying now.
She angrily wipes away a tear.
NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
I'd never had a great relationship
before.
I'd never made great choices
with men.
And he wasn't easy to get to
know.
He was older, my parents told me
I was nuts to get involved with him.
But he was so great to me.
Always
encouraging, telling me I could do
anything...
(beat)
He was the one.
You know, I'd give up
everything - everything - for just a
little more time.
I would've spent
fifteen minutes with him if that's all I
knew I had.
She's lost it.
Hawkins consoles her.
Nicolette shrugs him
off - turns back to her drink.
Downs the rest of it.
A
woman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins' producer - assistant in tow.
MAGGIE
Robert...?
HAWKINS
What are you doing here?
MAGGIE
(holding a cellular)
You've got a call.
HAWKINS
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't
you see I'm busy!
I can't talk
business.
Hang up.
Have a drink.
(to Paulie)
Get her a whiskey.
MAGGIE
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
Robert steps off the stool.
Takes the phone.
HAWKINS
Hello?
Who is this?
(listens)
How do I know this is you?
Hawkins gives Nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder.
Backs away from the bar.
Now out of hearing distance, he
looks back at Nicolette and lowers his voice.
HAWKINS (CONT'D)
Where?
We INTERCUT Emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie
theater.
Oleg videotapes Emil on the phone, as he throws
glances into the theater.
EMIL
Come to 45 Broadway.
Don't bring the
Police.
Come alone or you'll be in my
next film.
HAWKINS
(low)
Look asshole.
I've been threatened by
better than you.
EMIL
No.
I'm the best that's ever threatened
you.
HAWKINS
I'll meet you on one condition - I get
exclusivity and you surrender to me.
EMIL
We'll talk about that.
Four o'clock
gives you time to go to bank.
Three
hundred thousand dollars.
HAWKINS
What?
It doesn't work that way.
EMIL
(incensed)
If you don't want my film - I'll call
another show.
And they will show it.
HAWKINS
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
EMIL
Come alone.
Bring cash.
And we'll talk
about surrendering.
CLICK.
The line goes dead.
Hawkins disconnects.
Hands the
phone back to Maggie.
She's looking at him.
Excited.
Hawkins looks at Nicolette.
His mind whirls.
Daphne and Korfin are sitting at a table.
Korfin's arm is in
a sling, his side bandaged.
Duffy and Jordy enter in their
dress uniforms.
Korfin walks over to them.
KORFIN
How was it?
JORDY
(numb)
Not good.
Jordy's quiet.
Dazed.
Nobody can believe Eddie's gone.
DUFFY
(nods to Daphne)
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
KORFIN
Yeah.
He finished awhile ago.
DUFFY
(to Korfin)
Alright.
Swing by her apartment.
Let
her pick up her clothes and take her
straight to Hoover Street.
You got
that?
KORFIN
Yeah.
Jordy looks at her.
Duffy sees them hold each other's look.
JORDY
Chief - mind if I take her?
DUFFY
Okay.
But not water sports.
Duffy walks out.
Jordy leads Daphne out of the station.
Korfin follows.
A MAN IN A CHEAP SUIT is talking to Camello
who points as Jordy walks by.
The man chases after Jordy.
MAN
Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw?
JORDY
Yeah.
MAN
(shoving papers in Jordy's
hand)
Consider yourself served.
Jordy opens the papers.
Korfin puts Daphne in the car.
Walks back over to Jordy and reads over his shoulder.
KORFIN
Zwangendaba??? Is suing you, the
department and the city of New York for
10 million?
Who is Zwangendaba?
Jordy remembers...and gets more depressed.
JORDY
The mugger.
Jordy and Daphne make their way up the stairs.
A bouquet of
flowers are outside Daphne's apartment.
JORDY
What's this?
She takes the card.
Jordy looks over her shoulder.
Daphne
reads: "Good luck with all your troubles.
I'm here if you
need me...Ludwig."
JORDY (CONT'D)
Is he your boyfriend?
DAPHNE
Ludwig?
He's gay - are you jealous?
JORDY
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
DAPHNE
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest
you find another girlfriend that isn't
going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
They're staring in each other's eyes.
The sexual tension
strong.
JORDY
A good Immigration lawyer could stall
the process.
Eddie recommended one.
DAPHNE
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met
you.
JORDY
I'm glad I met you.
They hold each other's eyes...then suddenly they kiss.
Urgently.
Passionately.
Somebody is coming up the stairs.
They part quickly.
A tenant enters his apartment down the
hall.
Jordy clears his throat.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Let's get your stuff.
He opens the door.
Peers inside - checking it out.
Turns to
her.
Gestures that it's okay to enter.
It's very small.
Almost no furniture.
The bare minimum.
The apartment is a hole.
She looks at Jordy.
Both thinking
the same thought.
Another kiss.
JORDY
You better get packed.
DAPHNE
Right.
She holds his look.
JORDY
Do you have coffee?
DAPHNE
In the kitchen.
JORDY
I'll make some for us.
DAPHNE
I'll get my clothes.
She heads down the hall.
Jordy enters the small kitchen.
He
flips on the kitchen light and the LIGHTBULB EXPLODES -
SETTING THE CEILING ON FIRE AND RELEASING A RAIN OF FIRE INTO
THE ROOM.
Jordy JUMPS BACK.
DAPHNE (CONT'D)
Jordy!!!
JORDY
No!
Get back!
GET BACK!!!
Jordy's more surprised than shaken.
It's a fire - he knows
the drill.
He pushes her into the living room.
Then notices
a FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall.
Grabs it.
Aims it
at the FIRE spreading in the kitchen.
He SPRAYS as Daphne
SCREAMS!
DAPHNE
That's not mine!
WHOOOOOOOOOSH!
The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE!
Flames
leap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher
because it's filled with gasoline.
The handle LOCKS!
Jordy
CAN'T TURN IT OFF.
Flames engulf the extinguisher and
JORDY'S HAND.
He flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN.
Closes the door.
Jordy takes off his jacket.
Stuffs it
under the bottom of the door.
Blocking the smoke.
He
hurries into the living room.
Knowing it's moments before
the extinguisher will explode.
Jordy pulls out his cellular.
Hits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a
chair through the window.
JORDY
Don't!
It'll suck the flames toward us!
Too late.
She SMASHES the window.
There's an EXPLOSION in
the kitchen.
Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along
the ceiling.
Jordy yells into the phone:
JORDY (CONT'D)
This is Jordan Warsaw!
We got a 1075,
make it quick, we're trapped!
8th
Avenue and 44th Street.
He pulls Daphne toward the bedroom.
It's locked.
Jordy
kicks it open.
Grabs the comforter off the bed.
Shoves that
under the door jam.
He pulls Daphne into the bathroom.
Shuts the door.
Runs his severely burned hand under the cold
water.
Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens.
She notices someone has nailed the window shut.
And on top
of one nail...is Eddie's gold shield.
DAPHNE
Oh my G-d!
Oh my G-d!
Jordy turns - sees Eddie's shield.
DAPHNE (CONT'D)
They were here!
This freaks her out.
They were in her home.
She starts to
panic.
JORDY
Calm down.
Get a hold of yourself!
Get
down!
He pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub.
In it is a CAN OF
GASOLINE.
A virtual bomb.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Oh Jesus!
Daphne reaches for the can of gasoline.
JORDY (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
DAPHNE
Pouring it out!
She grabs the can of gasoline - pours it down the drain.
The
FIRE is raging outside the bathroom.
The bathroom door is
beginning to smoke and burn.
They are trapped.
Jordy turns - grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the
wall to the ceiling.
He throws his feet against the wall for
leverage.
Pulls with all his might to break it loose.
It's
creaking - but he's having a hard time with it.
DAPHNE (CONT'D)
Oh shit!
Jordy looks over.
The gasoline she's pouring out - is not
going down the drain.
It's stopped up.
As soon as the fire
gets in the bathroom, everything will explode!
Jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might.
Daphne comes over - helps him.
Both of them trying to break
it off.
Suddenly it snaps and water POURS into the room.
SOAKING THE WALLS.
They point the pipe toward the door,
soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door.
Trying to stop the fire from coming in.
He and Daphne are
drenched.
And trapped.
Jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe.
Starts SMASHING the wall
behind them.
The wall to the adjacent apartment.
VIDEO POV
Jordy and Daphne in the bathroom - surrounded by fire.
CAMERA WHIP PANS down the street as FIRE ENGINES arrive.
OLEG
is VIDEOTAPING them from the opposite rooftop.
Tenants from
Daphne's building are fleeing down the fire escape.
Emil
stands in back of Oleg - who is very excited.
He turns the
camera on himself.
OLEG
This is great film!
You can see fire
right now - Daphne is in fire - Fire
Marshal is here.
Everything is so
messy.
Everything is so crazy right
here!
Look at this fire!
We made it!
90% of people who die in fire die from
eating smoke.
So most likely they all
die from eating smoke.
The CAMERA PANS to Emil.
OLEG (CONT'D)
And this is the man who started the
fire.
Say something to your fans, Emil!
Emil waits a beat and then blows a kiss to the lens.
DAPHNE'S BATHROOM
Filled with smoke.
You can barely see Jordy or Daphne.
Jordy SMASHES a hole in the wall - which reveals the bathroom
in the apartment next door.
The smoke has a place to escape.
There's a 7-year old KID in there.
Standing in the bathroom.
Terrified.
JORDY
Get back!
Get out of the bathroom!
Run!
7-YEAR OLD KID
The hallway is on fire!
JORDY
It's okay.
I'm a fireman.
I'm going to
help you.
Get back!
Now!
Jordy pushes Daphne through the wall - turns as the bathroom
door catches fire.
It's seconds before the whole room will
blow up.
OLEG
Across the roof is videotaping the bathroom as it EXPLODES!
JORDY'S POV
as he enters the TV station.
His clothes burnt and still
wet.
The lobby's full of ANGRY COPS.
Tommy and Leon, still
in his funeral suit, SCREAMING above them all at Maggie the
producer and her ASSISTANT, who are standing behind the desk.
TOMMY
Where is he?!
Where is Hawkins?!
MAGGIE
He's not on the premises!
LEON
I want the tape.
Go get it and bring it
here this minute.
MAGGIE
Any request for the video must be
directed to "Top Story's" attorney -
Bruce Cutler.
I'll be happy to give you
his number.
Leon jumps over the desk where Maggie stands.
Tommy pushes
past the security guard to follow Leon.
They continue toward
Maggie, pushing her further back into the office.
She tries
to protect herself with an office door which Leon slams open.
LEON
Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV,
I'll get a warrant for your arrest and
shove it so far up your ass it'll come
outta your mouth!
MAGGIE
I want your shield number!
HAWKINS (O.S.)
Viewer discretion advised!
MAGGIE
(pointing at the TV)
You want the tape?
There it is!
Leon, Tommy, all the cops and Jordy - turn toward a TV set
which is mounted in the lobby.
The "Top Story" logo flashes
on the screen, then Robert Hawkins is seen behind his desk.
HAWKINS
What we are about to broadcast is very
graphic footage...
Everyone is riveted.
But Jordy notices outside...a "Top
Story" NEWS VAN is waiting in the alley.
Robert Hawkins
jumps from a doorway and into the van.
Jordy backs out.
POP...a video POV of a bottle of Crystal as the cork is
popped.
The videocamera pans up to Emil sitting at the
table.
He nods at the waiter who leaves.
Emil raises the
glass - looking into the lens.
EMIL
America!
Who says you can't be success
in America?
I arrived with nothing,
knowing nobody - now look - I am a
success story!
The videocamera is lowered.
Oleg turns it off.
Asks
suspiciously.
OLEG
You are success story?
I am success
story!
Why do you say I and not we?
EMIL
Oleg, don't be paranoid.
You got a
hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't
you?
I gave you half of what they gave
me.
Look - here we are!
Emil gestures toward the big television set.
We are in
Planet Hollywood - where diners and those by the bar can
watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling.
Robert Hawkins
is introducing his show.
HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
Good evening.
Welcome to "Top Story".
Tonight, I present to you material of a
graphic and violent nature never before
seen on television.
And I do so with a
heavy heart.
You will be first-hand
witness to the slaying of celebrated New
York City Homicide Detective, Eddie
Flemming.
It would be only normal to
ask, why?
Why are we showing something
so journalist, I must show it.
A
democracy survives through the freedom
of its media, and if we cannot see what
is happening then we don't deserve our
democracy, or our freedom.
Eddie
Flemming was my friend.
I cried when I
watched this footage and vowed to fight
this violence with every molecule of my
being from this day onward.
Hopefully,
this will have a similar effect on you.
One final word, this material is
absolutely not appropriate for children.
The restaurant BUZZES.
Emil checks his watch.
OLEG
In movie they make of us, who do you
think would act me?
EMIL
The one who got caught in the bathroom.
(beat)
George Michael.
Emil laughs.
Oleg doesn't.
OLEG
I'm serious.
EMIL
Shut up.
Look!
Emil points towards the TV.
"Top Story" is continuing.
The
scene cuts to Emil's video footage.
Eddie is handcuffed to
the chair.
The light illuminating his face.
OLEG (O.S.)
This is my project.
I say 'action.'
I
am the director!
You are the talent.
You wait for me to say 'action.'
(beat)
And 'action!'
EMIL
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Emil looks at Oleg - furious.
EMIL (CONT'D)
I told you to cut that out before we
handed in the tape!
OLEG
Be quiet.
Watch.
Oleg watches the big-screen TV as Emil raises the pistol to
Eddie's temple.
Eddie pushes him over the desk.
Eddie then
knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk onto
the floor.
Eddie continues around with the chair and drives
Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall.
Eddie
and Emil both go for the gun.
Eddie knocks him out of the
way.
Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly.
Leaves him in a ball on the floor.
Oleg comes at Eddie and
he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa.
The
blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more
light.
Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach.
Oleg kneels down
for a CLOSE-UP.
EMIL
Die.
Die.
The dinner patrons are watching TV.
Shocked.
Emil glares at
Oleg.
EMIL
Why did you leave that stuff in about
you being the director?
OLEG
Because I am the director.
Don't you
realize, if it wasn't for my film, for
my talent, my idea to do this - no way
would we be sitting here right now.
EMIL
Your idea?
I thought it was my idea.
Oleg tenses.
Emil laughs.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Aren't you just the cameraman?
Oleg doesn't laugh.
OLEG
I'm serious...this - this is a great
American film.
Full of violence and
sex.
And I want my credit.
EMIL
Credit?
OLEG
Yes.
Before we hand in the next video -
I put titles on it and my credit is
going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
EMIL
Yes.
But there's only one problem - you
want credit but the problem is - I don't
share credit.
Oleg is pissed.
EMIL (CONT'D)
You got that?
OLEG
No, I don't get that!
EMIL
You think you are a director?
You are a
fucking little, small Russian piece of
shit.
And I hate you.
I fucking hate
you.
Emil slaps Oleg across the face.
Oleg stands up.
Emil
suddenly pulls out Eddie's gun but before he can pull the
trigger, Oleg STABS Emil in the arm!
Emil squeezes off a
shot through the crowded restaurant.
Patrons SCREAM - Oleg
runs through the restaurant, escaping.
It's chaos.
Hawkins arrives with a crew and with BRUCE CUTLER, a
confident, tough criminal attorney.
Emil pulls the steak knife out of his arm, picks up a napkin -
pressing it to his wound.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Oh, hello.
Cutler accesses the situation.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Are you my attorney?
(extends his hand to Cutler)
I'm Emil.
I'm insane.
CUTLER
I'm not your lawyer until I see the
money.
EMIL
Here.
I have your money.
Emil picks up a briefcase and hands it to Cutler.
Cutler
opens it - inside is the cash Emil got from Robert Hawkins.
Emil looks at the table, pushing the plates and silverware
aside.
Emil looks under the table, throwing the chair aside,
freaking.
He's lost the most important thing in his life.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Oh no!
No!
Shit!
CUTLER
(follows Emil - reaching out to
him)
Emil.
Take it easy.
Stay with me.
Sit
down.
What do you need?
What are you
looking for?
EMIL
He has the camera!
He took the movie!
Jordy comes in, gun raised.
JORDY
Don't move!
Don't move!
Get your hands
up!
Drop it!
Emil puts his hands in the air.
Immediately drops the gun!
EMIL
I give up!
Jordy is disappointed!
He didn't want to take Emil alive.
Hawkins signals to his camera man, who swings his camera at
Jordy as he approaches Emil, his gun aimed at Emil's head.
CUTLER
This man is unarmed, officer.
He's
surrendered.
Jordy cracks Emil across the face - knocking him down.
CUTLER (CONT'D)
What are you hitting him for?
JORDY
Turn that camera off!
Jordy handcuffs him.
Emil turns to the camera for sympathy,
appearing more hurt than he is.
EMIL
No.
Keep filming...
Jordy realizes how media savvy Emil is and understands in
that moment why he's surrendering.
Jordy yanks Emil up -
dragging him across the restaurant floor - Emil still
favoring his ankle.
CUTLER
(to Emil)
Don't say anything.
EMIL
Where are we going?
CUTLER
I'm coming with you.
EMIL
Yes.
Yes, come with me!
CUTLER
(to Jordy)
I'm invoking rights - this man is
represented by counsel.
I'm coming with
him.
The "Top Story" crew is all over them, filming everything.
Cutler stays close to Emil.
Making sure he's in the video
footage.
JORDY
Turn that camera off!
Jordy takes a left turn, racing away.
Running all the
lights.
TOMMY
What are you doin'?
You're gonna lose
everybody!
Jordy rips through another turn, heading toward the West Side
Highway.
The car speeds up the ramp and races up the left
lane - having lost the police.
TOMMY (CONT'D)
Where are you goin'??
This ain't the
way to the station!
Jordy looks up at Emil in the rear view mirror.
A room service WAITER wheels a tray with a magnum bottle of
Crystal, with three glasses, toward Oleg's room.
Jordy
follows behind him - gun aimed at his back.
WAITER
Do you really need me?
JORDY
Keep your mouth shut.
Don't mess this
up.
They reach the room.
Jordy flattens himself against the
wall.
The waiter KNOCKS.
HOOKER'S VOICE
Who's there?
WAITER
(nervous)
R-room service.
A HOOKER, wrapped in a towel, opens the door a crack, looking
out at the waiter.
HOOKER
Come in.
Jordy whips around the corner - pointing his gun and pushing
the hooker back out of the room.
Jordy moves to the bedroom
door.
Peers through the crack.
Oleg sits on the edge of the
bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes.
He's hooked
up his videocamera to the TV set and is showing them his
footage of the fire.
OLEG
Look at that.
See that shot!
Seamless.
No cuts.
(excited)
And look.
Look at that transition.
That's filmmaking!!
Isn't it great?!
Jordy KICKS in the door - gun raised.
JORDY
Don't move!
Oleg grabs the videocamera.
Has on hooker in a head lock and
picks up the other one.
He rushes at Jordy - using one of
the hookers for protection.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Drop the girl!
Drop her!!
Oleg pushes the hookers at Jordy - knocking Jordy back into
the living room and over the back of the sofa.
Oleg rushes
out into the
HOTEL HALLWAY
Oleg runs to the fire exit - Jordy follows, chasing Oleg down
the stairwell.
Oleg, gun in hand, runs past the TICKET TAKER at the door.
TICKET TAKER
Hey, come back here!
The ticket taker runs after Oleg who continues past the candy
counter.
Jordy rushes in the door.
JORDY
Where is he?
Where'd he go?
TICKET TAKER
Middle door.
Jordy continues running through the lobby - past the middle
door - and enters the theater through the far door.
Jordy enters the theater, crouches down in the aisle.
It's a
night scene, the theater is dark.
Jordy tries to see faces.
He cuts through a row of seats to the middle aisle.
DRUNK'S VOICE
Kill him!
Kill the bastard!
Jordy spins toward the voice - it's a DRUNK.
Others start
YELLING for blood!
AUDIENCE
Shoot him!
SHOOT!
A GUNSHOT!
Jordy ducks!
Another GUNSHOT!
Jordy realizes
the shots are coming from the screen.
OLEG
Look!
Over here!
Jordy turns.
Oleg stands up and FIRES at him - trying to
film Jordy's death with a videocamera.
Jordy ducks, then rises up with his gun as Oleg vaults over
the seats, leaping from one to the other, mashing shoulders
and heads, bounding for the screen.
JORDY
Everybody down!
Stay DOWN!
Jordy FIRES as the screen villain blasts away.
Some in the
audience don't realize the real thing is happening.
Oleg
leaps on the stage in front of the screen, illuminated by it.
Jordy runs down the aisle.
Oleg FIRES at Jordy.
Jordy FIRES
back.
People panic - scurrying away - Jordy can't get a
clear shot.
Oleg FIRES again, wounding a moviegoer.
Jordy
raises up as the theater lights go on...and Oleg is gone!
Jordy jumps on the stage - runs backstage - Oleg has
disappeared.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Shit!
SIRENS are heard from outside.
VOICES of cops are heard as
they enter.
CLOSE ON TV
A REPORTER is in Times Square, reports from outside the movie
theater.
REPORTER (ON T.V.)
...and the wild chase through Times
Square ended with the suspect, Oleg
Razgul, escaping.
The fire department
has identified the fire marshal involved
in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw.
The channel is changed.
PETER ARNETT is reporting the same
story.
PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
In a related matter, Mr. Slovak's
attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for
handling sensational cases - claims his
client is unfit to stand trial.
Daphne sitting on a bench in a jail cell.
Watching TV
through the bars.
She is in the fire department's holding
cell in Brooklyn.
PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
In fact, Cutler claimed Mr. Slovak was
not the alleged mastermind behind the
murders.
According to Cutler, Mr. Slovak was
being directed by his partner, who
threatened to kill him if he didn't
follow Mr. Razgul's orders.
Cutler told
reporters today that Mr. Razgul did in
fact stab his client.
The scene CUTS TO Cutler's press conference.
CUTLER
My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim.
What's happened is not his fault.
Emil
was under the influence of his partner.
At the trial, you'll see that my client
will be vindicated...
The CAMERA WIDENS from the TV set.
We are now in an
interview room, a guard is posted outside the room.
Emil
sits at a small table - with Cutler.
Emil is dressed in
Bellevue clothes.
He's handcuffed and his ankle is bandaged.
Emil gives a complimentary nod toward Cutler.
CUTLER
I brought you some letters.
It's really
fan mail.
Women mostly.
One wants to
buy you clothes, another sent a check.
Another wants a check.
EMIL
You bring the cigarettes?
CUTLER
Oh, sure.
Cutler shakes a cigarette out of the pack, stuffs it in
Emil's mouth and lights it for him.
Emil has never smoked
before.
CUTLER (CONT'D)
How're they treating you, alright
(Emil is nonresponsive)
I want to get the cuffs off... but
there's a little bit of a problem.
Things out there are very negative right
now for us.
We gotta change that
around.
Perception is very, very
important.
Perception is reality.
I
know you're not fuckin' crazy.
But it's
important that I get that message out.
Cause that's our only defense in this
case.
Emil leans forward.
Cutler retrieves the cigarette from
between his lips.
CUTLER (CONT'D)
I want you to focus on three things:
fear...
He puts the cigarette back in Emil's mouth.
CUTLER (CONT'D)
...delusions and paranoia.
EMIL
I was all of these.
CUTLER
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity
of it until recently.
No question about
that.
EMIL
What about Oleg?
CUTLER
Disappeared.
They're looking
everywhere.
Maybe he went back to
Czechoslovakia.
EMIL
No, he is here.
Shit...
CUTLER
Don't worry about him.
Think about
yourself.
EMIL
What about my movie rights?
Book
rights?
CUTLER
Look, I haven't really focused on that
kind of thing.
EMIL
What's your cut?
How much?
CUTLER
I would say...half.
Half is fair.
EMIL
(laughs)
No.
No way.
CUTLER
But it's...
EMIL
Thirty-percent.
No more.
Or I call
another lawyer.
This is the biggest
case of your life.
Don't try to
negotiate.
Thirty percent.
Say yes or
no.
CUTLER
This is not about money, Emil.
I need
your trust in me.
EMIL
What else do you need?
CUTLER
I need to know about your background.
I
need to know about your upbringing.
Why
you're here.
EMIL
(indicating cigarette)
Give me another one, please.
Cutler stuffs another cigarette in Emil's mouth.
Lights it.
CUTLER
Tell me about yourself.
What you did as
a young boy... what your parents were
like.
EMIL
My father always degraded me.
Killed my
self-esteem.
And my mother was blind.
CUTLER
Your mother was blind?
EMIL
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me.
She went to fucking black market doctor
to induce me.
CUTLER
Back in the Czech Republic?
EMIL
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad
drugs which made her go blind.
And my
father blamed me for her blindness...
CUTLER
Your father blamed you for your mother's
blindness?
EMIL
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was
born.
Put it out.
Can you put the
cigarette out?
Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil's lips and extinguishes
it.
EMIL (CONT'D)
That's what he did to me.
He put
cigarettes out on me.
CUTLER
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
EMIL
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
CUTLER
Can I see your back?
Emil rises.
Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up.
HIS
ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM
CIGARETTE BURNS.
Cutler recoils - horrified.
CUTLER (CONT'D)
Oh, Jesus.
EMIL
I'm abused.
Don't you think?
CUTLER
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's
torture.
Inside the Arson Squad, Duffy sits behind his desk.
Jordy
stands across the table from his Chief.
Behind Jordy we can
see Garcia and Korfin outside, listening.
Duffy has a
subpoena in his hand.
DUFFY
The public doesn't have any idea what we
do and now you're going to define our
image!
This is going to be our Rodney
King!
JORDY
What was I supposed to do?
The guy
tried to mug me.
I was gonna send a cop
back - I just forgot.
DUFFY
Forgot?
You handcuffed a civilian to a
tree?!
JORDY
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this
guy was no innocent civilian.
DUFFY
Well this is gonna end your career and
probably mine.
JORDY
End my career?
DUFFY
How are you going to fight this?
Maybe
if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd
been on the front page, as a hero, this
thing would be easier to fight.
You'd
have the good to weight against the bad!
It's unfortunate that I have to make
decisions based upon your press coverage
but there's nothing I can do!
Gimme
your shield.
JORDY
But Chief?
Over this??
DUFFY
There's nothing to talk about.
Get a
good lawyer.
You're suspended until
your trial.
Jordy sighs.
Dying inside.
He surrenders his shield.
Drops
his handcuffs, his pager and his gun.
Duffy picks up the gun
- looks at it.
DUFFY (CONT'D)
(pats Jordy's shoulder)
I know you got backup at home.
Drop it
off.
Jordy sighs and exits.
Jordy is talking to BILL STERN, a senior special agent.
In
another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old ASSISTANT
U.S. ATTORNEYS.
STERN
(to Jordy)
Look, what don't you understand?
We've
got a good relationship with the Czech's
and the State Department doesn't want to
cause an incident.
JORDY
But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!
STERN
They've got her testimony on videotape.
And even if they do take her to court
immediately after she'll be extradited.
The Czechs want her back.
She shot a
cop!
I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil
Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech
Republic?
How would you feel if the
Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?!
Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office.
Lowers
his voice.
STERN (CONT'D)
And just between us...I was married to a
redhead.
They're a jinx.
Redheads are
like cross-eyed priests.
Stay away from
both.
Jordy gives him a look.
STERN (CONT'D)
You want to see her - go ahead.
Jordy enters the other office.
Sits next to Daphne.
The
assistant U.S. Attorneys leave.
JORDY
We're gonna fight the extradition.
Daphne takes Jordy's bandaged hand in hers.
DAPHNE
Forget about me.
You have enough
problems of your own.
JORDY
...Do you really want me to forget about
you?
DAPHNE
I don't want to drag you down with me.
JORDY
Daphne, I...
Daphne touches her finger to his lips.
DAPHNE
Shhhh.
She leans in and kisses him.
Then looks into his eyes,
trying to find a smile.
Jordy's on the couch.
A drink in his hand, watching TV with
his dog, ZACK.
Jordy's eyes are glazed.
He's drunk, his
eyes are as bloodshot as Eddie's were...without his job or
Daphne.
His mind miles away - the dog and drink are his only comfort.
As Nicolette reports (she got the name right), her anger
seeps through her broadcast.
NICOLETTE (ON T.V.)
Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct
descendent of the African King from whom
he takes his name...
Jordy's face is flashed on screen.
The phone RINGS.
Jordy
picks up.
JORDY
Hello?
(listens)
No comment.
He hangs up.
The phone RINGS AGAIN.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Hello?
(listens)
No!
Jordy hangs up.
Changes the channel.
He stops as Robert
Hawkins' face fills the screen.
He is standing across from
someone - in a park - interviewing him.
HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
He robbed you?
The ANGLE CUTS to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a
suit and tie.
Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut.
He
stands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the
tree.
He's appearing on "Top Story".
ZWANGENDABA (ON T.V.)
That's right, I encountered him right
here.
I was just askin' for change an'
he whips out his big gun an' pushes me
up against that tree, whereupon he takes
my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin'
me there all exposed...
The phone RINGS again.
Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off
the table and throws it through the window:
BACK TO TV
as the channel is changed.
A REPORTER is on TV.
Behind him
is a picture of Emil.
Emil is smiling, in a shirt and tie.
The reporter stands in front of the jail.
REPORTER
...and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak
won't have to worry about how he is
going to pay for his defense.
He has
received movie offers and been in
conversations with numerous publishers
concerning the rights to his life story.
REVERSE ANGLE
Oleg is at a bar watching TV.
Poisoned with envy.
Jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser.
We see
the TV overturned in the b.g.
His back up gun is on it.
He
stares at it.
Dark thoughts dancing in his head.
