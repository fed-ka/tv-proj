        FADE IN:

    1INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT1

        A few hours before dawn, the subway deserted. The last car is
          filthy, littered, scarred by graffiti, its lights FLICKER ON AND
        OFF as the train shakes along the tracks.

        A FAT MAN sits at one end, reading a morning tabloid. At the back
        of the train a black cleaning lady, MRS. DALBY, small, fiftyish,
        and bone-tired, clutches her oversized purse and stares wearily
        out at nothing. They shake and sway to the motion of the train
        with the obliviousness of veteran subway riders.


        ANGLE ON DOORS

        as the car pulls into a station, and the doors HISS open. TWO
        PUNKS enter, laughing and joking loudly. They're teenagers,
          wearing gang colors and shades, with hard, street-scarred
        faces.

        BACK TO THE SCENE

        The fat man looks up at the punks, doesn't like what he sees,
        folds up his newspaper, and quietly slips out, moving up to the
        next car. The punks LAUGH.

        ANGLE PAST PUNKS ON MRS. DALBY

        She has shrunk back in her seat, frightened.

                                        FIRST PUNK
                        Who you looking at?

        She looks down, tries to ignore him.

                                        SECOND PUNK
                        Hey, lady, we re talking to you.

        MRS. DALBY'S POV

        The first punk whispers something unintelligible. They laugh and
        turn to look at her. The lights GO OUT again.

        When they come back on, the punks are right on top of her. Their
        smiles are arrogant, predatory..

                                      FIRST PUNK
                        Got a match, lady?                                                                                            2.


    1CONTINUED:1

      BACK TO THE SCENE

      Mrs. Dalby shakes her head, clutches her oversized purse even
      more tightly.

                                      MRS. DALBY
                      No... please...

        The car lights go off, come back on.

                                                SECOND PUNK
                      Bet you got some matches in the
                      bag, lady. Give it here.

                                      MRS. DALBY
                      No matches. You leave me alone.

                                      FIRST PUNK
                                (reaching for bag)
                      Let's have a look.

      He pulls at the bag, she resists, and the second punk HITS her
      hard with back of his hand. She lets go of the purse, slumps in
        the seat. The lights go on, off. The first punk rummages through
        the purse. .

        CLOSE ON DOOR BETWEEN CARS

      as it slides open just a crack. The lights flick on, off. A HAND
      is curled around the doorframe, a hand with matted fur and
        claws.

                                      FIRST PUNK
                                (o.s.)
                        Nineteen dollars! She's only got
                        nineteen dollars!

        BACK TO THE SCENE

        The punk empties the purse on the floor. Mrs. Dalby CRIES OUT
        and falls to her knees, trying to retrieve her possessions. The
        punks start having fun, kicking at her things as she grabs for
        them. The lights go out again as they begin kicking her. In the
        dark, the punks are dim silhouettes kicking at her, cursing. We
        hear their GRUNTS and LAUGHTER, her PLEADING, the impact of
        their BOOTS -and then the sound of the door sliding open.


                                      SECOND PUNK
                      What was that?

                                                                      (CONTINUED)          Rev. 7/31/873.


      1CONTINUED:(2)1

            Something large and fast explodes out of the darkness and slams
          into him. The train enters a long station, and screams through
          without stopping, but the STATION LIGHT strobes through the
          windows as they fight.

          SERIES OF SHOTS

          Images in the dark, lit against the windows: the first punk
          locked in struggle with the attacker, a clawed hand upraised to
          strike, the sound of RIPPING FABRIC, SCREAMS, the second punk
          opening a switchblade, the punk's face, all the arrogance
          suddenly gone from it, just a terrified boy now, darkness, a
          SLASHING sound, the face again, with a series of jagged slashes
          down his cheek, the blood welling from them, the knife spinning
          from his grasp, claws, upraised again to strike, the punk
          staggering, clutching his stomach, falling, a dark silhouette
          bent over him, SLASHING.

          ANGLE ON MRS. DALBY

          She scrabbles back, holding her empty purse to her chest
        as if for protection. A dark shape looms over her, raises
          a hand. Mrs. Dalby whimpers, shrinks in on herself, as if
          to avoid the blow. But the claws close around the emergency pull,
          yank, and the subway comes SCREECHING to a sudden halt. The dark
          shape opens the rear door, and runs off down the tracks,
            vanishing in the dark as Mrs. Dalby watches.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


    2INT. MAXWELL'S OFFICE - DAY2

          Deputy DA Joe Maxwell has a huge stack of files on his desk as
          Cathy enters. She looks at them doubtfully.

                                        CATHY
                          I have a horrible suspicion that
                          those are for me.

                                        MAXWELL
                          Bingo, Radcliffe. It's your own fault.
                        First thing I learned*
                        in the Army -- never volunteer. This*
                        is an ugly one. Take a good look.*
                                                                                                          *


          Maxwell hands her a thick gray envelope. Cathy opens it, and
          slides out some glossy police photographs.      Rev. 7/31/874.

      We glimpse them very briefly, as Cathy rifles through them:
        they're police shots of the bodies of the two punks.

                                      MAXWELL (V.O.)
                      Seventeen and sixteen. They look like
                      they tried to go a round with a tiger.
                      Only this animal walks around on two
                      feet, and half the city thinks he's a
                      hero.

      BACK TO THE SCENE

                                      MAXWELL
                      You look a little green. Sure
                      you've got the stomach for this?

        Cathy is clearly shaken. She's seen something like this before
      -- she's seen Vincent tear men apart. She can't admit that
        now.

                                      CATHY
                      I'm sure. What do you want me to
                      do?

                                      MAXWELL
                      Our subway slasher knows how to take
                      care of himself.*
                                (slaps stack of files)
                      So what you got here, you got your
                        self-defense classes, your karate
                        schools, your kung fu instructors. Be
                      the first deb on your block
                      to collect the whole set.


        Cathy opens the topmost file on the pile.

                                      MAXWELL
                      You know the profile we're looking for.
                        Recent crime victims, maybe someone
                        who's lost family. Flag anything
                        subway-related. You've heard of the
                        subways, right? .

                                      CATHY
                                (wry, sarcastic)
                        I think someone mentioned them to
                        me once.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)          Rev. 7/31/875.

          She gathers up the cumbersome stack of files and heads for
          the door. .


                                        MAXWELL
                            Hey, Radcliffe...
                                  (Cathy looks back)

                        a token costs.

          Cathy hesitates for a beat, and Maxwell grins.

      Isaac Stubbs steps from behind a heavy bag, smiling. He's wearing
      boxing gloves; she's caught him in the middle of working out.


                                      ISAAC
                      Can't fool you anymore.

                      I had a good teacher.

                      Come for the refresher course, or
                      is this a social call?

                                      CATHY
                        Neither, I'm afraid. I need to ask
                      you a few questions.

                        Anything makes you sound that
                        serious, it's got to be pretty
                      heavy. Are we talking money,
                      baseball, or love here?

                      We're talking the subway slasher.

      Isaac REACTS; his smile and easy-going manner vanish
        suddenly.

                      Whom I talking to here, a friend or a

                      Wrong answer.

      He turns his back on her and resumes his workout, pounding the
      heavy bag. Cathy moves closer to him and continues the talk, but
      Isaac bites out his replies between punches.

                                      CATHY

15EXT. CITY STREET. DAY15

      Cathy and Isaac (now in street clothes) are walking through a seedy
      Lower East Side neighborhood. The buildings are run down, at least
      a century old.

                                    ISAAC.

            building at least a century old. It was a cheap hotel once, but
          now it's been converted to other uses: the modern sign on the

  19INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY19

          They enter a large, airy gymnasium, the hardwood floor covered
          with mats. Around the room, several instructors in karate
          whites and black belts are working with small groups of
            students, teaching them various self-defense techniques --
          karate, judo, boxing, street-fighting, etc.

                          Look around. These folks ain't crazed
                          vigilantes in training, Cathy -- just
                          ordinary people trying to take care of
                          each other. You wanted to know whose
                          side I was on?


          He points across the floor to one corner where SUKI, a
          lithe young Oriental woman, is instructing a half-dozen
          senior citizens. The woman she's working with is
          diminutive, wizened, at least seventy.

                          I'm on their side.

          Cathy watches for a beat, as Suki shows the little old lady some
            self-defense techniques. .


                                          CATHY .
                          Is that responsible? A woman that old
                          could get seriously hurt if she tries
                          to resist a mugger.

          JASON WALKER steps up behind them as Cathy speaks. He's a
          tall, handsome black man, ten years younger than Isaac but
          almost as muscular, with the fluid grace of the most
            accomplished martial artists. He's dressed informally, with his
          white Protectors beret slanted rakishly. Obviously educated and
            articulate, Walker has considerable charm and dynamism. .

                          just couldn't get her wedding ring
                          off her finger. The mugger figured
                          he'd make it easy for her by cutting
                          off the finger. One of our people

DINT. JASON WALKER'S OFFICE - DAY20

      Jace is PACING behind his desk in a large office furnished with
      comfortable but inexpensive second-hand furniture. Isaac stands
      near the door, listening. On the walls are photos of Jace with
      various celebrities and politicians, some framed maps of
      Manhattan, and a collection of various weapons and martial arts
      implements: samurai swords, nunchuks, throwing stars, crossbows,
      a morning star, etc. Among the collection is A SET OF METAL
         TIGER-CLAWS.  The tiger claws should be clearly visible on the
      wall in shots of Jace, but the camera should not linger on them
      or emphasize them in any way.

                    If a transit cop had rescued that lady,
                      he'd get a commendation.
                    This guy is minus a badge, so that makes
                              him a psychopathic monster.

                                      CATHY
                      No. Ripping two teenagers to pieces
                      makes him a psychopathic monster. A
                      transit cop would have arrested them.

                      Right. And seeing as they were
                      juveniles, they would have served a
                      little soft time and then been back on
                      the subways, kicking another old lady

22INT. CATHY'S BASEMENT. THAT NIGHT22

        The basement is pitch black. We HEAR Cathy's footsteps as she
        carefully descends the stairs, then pulls the chain on
        the bare bulb swinging overhead. She's carrying a heavy wrench.
        She looks briefly but meaningfully at the
        ceiling-high stack of cardboard boxes against the far wall,
        then crosses to the large STEAM PIPES and begins to BANG against
        them with the wrench. The bangs are carefully spaced, like Morse
        code -- she's sending a message. We MOVE IN on Cathy as she
        repeats the message, each blow harder than the one before. Her
        face is tight with longing and apprehension.


                                      CATHY
                                (whispering)
                        Vincent.. please...

        She repeats the message again, banging as hard as she can, a
        wordless metallic shout of concern. We HOLD TIGHT on Cathy's
        face as she swings.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


23EXT. CATHY'S BALCONY. NIGHT23

        She's waiting out on the balcony, waiting for Vincent to come to
        her. The light spills through the glass doors behind her, and all
        around her are the city lights. She's reading a heavy hardcover
        book, probably something that Vincent gave her, but her mind
        isn't on the book .. she keeps LOOKING UP, anticipating his
        arrival.

        A tabloid newspaper lies on a small table beside her. ANGLING
        PAST Cathy, we see the headline:  SUBWAY SLASHER -PSYCHOPATH OR
        SAVIOR? 

                                                                      MATCH DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                          16.

2424EXT. CATHY S BALCONY -  LATER THAT NIGHT

      Many of the city lights are out; it's the silent, dark hours just
        before dawn. Cathy is asleep in her chair, the book on her chest.
      Cathy stirs restlessly in her sleep. We PAN slowly past her to
      the railing and the city beyond.

      CLOSE ON RAILING

      as Vincent's HAND suddenly appears from below. He grips the
      metal rail, pulls himself slowly into view. His grip is so
        strong that we see the rail slowly begin to BEND.

      BACK TO THE SCENE


      Cathy stirs, blinks, sees Vincent, and sits up abruptly.

                                      CATHY
                      You came...

        Vincent climbs over the rail as Cathy rises.

                                      CATHY
                      You don't know how much I needed to
                      see you.

      They embrace, but Cathy suddenly PULLS BACK.  She can
      tell that something is dreadfully amiss.

                                      CATHY
                        Vincent, what's wrong?

      CLOSE ON VINCENT

        Wordlessly, he smiles. Briefly, it looks like Vincent's normal
        smile: gentle, melancholy, full of compassion. Then it grows
        wider, turns into a mocking predatory grin for a moment, until
      his fangs are bared and we are looking into the eyes of the
        beast. Vincent SNARLS.

      BACK TO THE SCENE

        Terrified, Cathy tries to break free, but Vincent holds her tight,
      still snarling. They struggle.

                                      CATHY
                      No... Vincent, no!

      But it's no use, the humanity is gone from him. He attacks her
        savagely. Cathy begins to SCREAM, and we

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:                                                                                          17.


25 EXT. CATHY'S BALCONY - DAWN25

      as she wakes, still screaming and struggling, from her
        dream. It takes her a moment to realize it was just a
        dream. When the realization comes, Cathy sinks slowly back into
      her chair, staring bleakly out at sunrise. She covers her face
      with her hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:


26INT. CATHY'S BASEMENT - DAY26

      Cathy descends the cellar stairs. She's carrying a heavy-duty
        flashlight and wearing jeans, boots, a heavy workshirt. She
      moves aside the cardboard boxes stacked against the wall,
        revealing a jagged entrance to the tunnels. She enters.



27INT. STEAM TUNNELS - BELOW THE CITY - DAY27

      Cathy walks confidently down the long tunnel, her footsteps
        ECHOING loudly as she goes.

      She reaches a T-shaped junction, starts right, hesitates, then
        retraces her steps, goes left. .

      She opens a heavy iron door marked NO ADMITTANCE. The door
      behind is bricked shut. Cathy REACTS, clearly startled. She
        touches the bricks, but they're solid. She moves off uncertainly.



28INT. BRICK TUNNEL - NIGHT28

      She gropes along an unfamiliar passage, its walls ancient
        brick, covered with nitre. Water is dripping here. This
      is a very old, spooky section of the tunnels, and it's clear that
      Cathy has never passed this way before. Somehow she's gotten lost,
      and her face shows her alarm.

        She comes on an old brick WELL in the center of the
        passage, and brushes against a loose brick on its rim
        as she squeezes by. The brick falls for a long beat
        before we hear the faint SPLASH. Cathy moves past.
        An old WROUGHT IRON GATE blocks her passage. Cathy sets
        the flashlight on a ledge in the brick wall, pushes at
        the gate, but she can't move it. She feels around the
        brick walls for a release, a key, anything, finds
        nothing. She grasps the bars, SHOUTS.

                                      CATHY
                        Hello... Vincent... anyone ...
                        hello...                                                                                          18.


  28CONTINUED:28

      Her voice echoes a long way, reverberating in the dark, but there's
      no reply. Cathy hears a NOISE behind her, reaches for her
        flashlight. There's a huge grey RAT on the ledge where she set it
      down. It screeches at her, and Cathy gives a yelp of startled fear,
      before she works up the courage to snatch her flashlight back, and
      run back down the narrow tunnel.


      She backtracks to the well, almost passes it, then stops. She
        shines the light into the well, SEES iron rungs descending into
        nothingness. Cathy studies the well, pushing, prodding, and
        finally touches a LOOSE BRICK set in its base. It turns slowly
      when she pushes at it, and from below we hear a GRINDING NOISE,
        followed by the rush of DRAINING WATER.



29INT. IN THE WELL - NIGHT29

      Cathy descends carefully, the flashlight held awkwardly in her
      hand. She stops, twists around on the rungs, shines the flashlight
      down.

                                                                    CUT TO:


30CATHY'S POV30

        Darkness, and a long, long dizzying drop.


31BACK TO THE SCENE31

      As she stares down, the rung she's clinging to comes right out of
      the crumbling brick. Cathy starts to FALL, grabs another rung. She
      hangs on precariously by one hand, but loses her grip on the
        flashlight. It falls, shatters. Cathy clings to the ladder, alone
      in the dark, breathing hard, scared. The rung she's clutching
        begins to pull loose of the brick wall. She grabs for another,
        misses, the run comes loose.


        CLOSE ON CATHY
          Screaming, she FALLS&right into Vincent s arms.

        INT. BOTTOM OF THE WELL - NIGHT32

                                                                                                    32

        Vincent stands Silhouetted in the golden light spill from a

        secret door he has opened in the bottom of the well.

          Cathy is shaking and shuddering, breathing hard from her
          close call. Without saying a word, Vincent turns and carries her
          into the warm light and the wall closes behind
          them, swallowing them up. .

    FADE IN:

33INT. VINCENT'S CHAMBER. NIGHT33

    Cathy sits huddled in a blanket, hot tea in front of her,
      untouched. Vincent stands a few feet away, his face averted and
    hidden by his hood, greatly troubled by her presence.

                                    CATHY
                    I thought I'd remember... I got turned
                    around somehow, everything seemed
                      strange, different... frightening.


                                    VINCENT
                    The ways change, Catherine. For every
                    safe road, there are a hundred paths
                    that end only in darkness. Parts of
                    these tunnels are very old. Older than
                    your subways and your sewers, and far
                    more dangerous.


      Cathy shivers, looks up at him.

                                    CATHY
                    I had to come. I had to see you. I was
                    afraid...

      Vincent's eyes are deeply sorrowful.

                                    VINCENT
                    I know.

                                    CATHY
                    You didn't come... I called... on
                    the pipes... but you never came.


                                    VINCENT
                    I could feel your fear, Catherine.
                    Even now. .
                            (turns away from her)
                      I frighten you.

      Cathy shrugs off the blanket, stands, goes to him.


                                    CATHY
                    You taught me always to face my
                    fears, Vincent... tell me...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          21.


  33CONTINUED:33

                                        VINCENT
                      What shall I tell you? That I am
                      not this... shadow, this
                        man-monster you hunt? Must you
                      hear those words before you can
                        trust? Hear them, then. It is not
                      me.
                                (gently)
                        I would never hurt you, Catherine.

        Vincent slowly raises a hand to touch her cheek. Cathy tries,
        but the fear is still in her, and she cannot help a small,
          involuntary FLINCH away from his claws. Vincent pulls back,
          devastated, moves away from her.

                                      CATHY
                                (anguished)
                        Vincent, no... please, I didn't
                        mean...

                                        VINCENT
                      ... to pull away. I know, Catherine. I
                        know your heart.
                           (gently, but pained)
                      But sometimes the words we cannot
                        speak are the truest words of all ...
                        however much they hurt...


                                      CATHY
                        What are you saying?

                                        VINCENT
                      You know what you've seen. You
                        know what I am.
                                (beat)
                      You know what you fear.

              He raises his hands in front of him, stares down at them.

                                        VINCENT
                      We both know what these hands can do...
                        have done. Catherine, if your heart
                        does not know the truth, no words of
                        mine will help.

        Vincent takes her gently by the arm.


                                        VINCENT
                        It's time for you to go home.

        He leads her unresisting from the chamber.

      as Vincent leads Cathy home. They walk in silence, an air of
      melancholy hanging over them, both bereft.


3SINT. CATHY'S BASEMENT - NIGHT3S

      Vincent turns to go. Cathy stands helplessly for a moment, then
      calls after him, beseeching.

                                      CATHY
                      Don't go. Vincent, please. I m
                      afraid -

                                      VINCENT
                      None of us is without fear,
                        Catherine... in your world or mine...
                              {beat)
                      The killings draw their eyes
                      downward. The subways now, but soon
                      deeper... to the hidden places where
                      we dwell... We will be watching. It
                      is all that we can do.



      Vincent turns and leaves her, his cape billowing behind him. As he
      vanishes from her sight, Cathy calls after him with desparate
      longing.


                                      CATHY
                      Vincent...

      As her anguished call hangs in the hair, we

                                                                    CUT TO:


36VINCENT36

      Out of Cathy's sight, he SLUMPS against the tunnel wall, torn up.
      We HEAR Cathy calling again, her voice faint with distance.
        Vincent, unable to hold in the pain any longer, throws back his
      head in torment, and SMASHES his fists against a large steam pipe
      in a blind moment of rage. The pipe breaks, and STEAM RISES all
        around him, obscuring his figure. His shape, lost amidst the
        steam, gives a terrible blood-curdling ROAR that echoes up and
      down the tunnels.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                            23.


37INT. N.Y.P.D. COMPUTER ROOM - THE NEXT DAY37

        Cathy enters, looking morose, and goes to Edie at her
        computer console.

                                        EDIE
                        You look sadder than my last date.
                        Anything I can do?

                                        CATHY
                        I need to see the file on Mrs.
                        Beatrice Dalby.

        The name clearly rings a bell with Edie. She
        frowns

                                        EDIE
                        That's the cleaning lady who got
                        saved by the slasher, isn't it? I
                        didn't know you were supposed to
                          question her.

                                        CATHY
                        I'm not.

        Edie looks very dubious.This isn't by the book.

                                        EDIE
                        Then, why -

                                        CATHY.

                        Let's just say I've got a very
                        dirty apartment.

    With a sigh and a shake of her head, Edie starts hitting he~
      computer keys.

                                                                      CUT TO:


  38INT. WHISPERING GALLERY (MATTE) - NIGHT38

        A HUGE brick tunnel, cavernous, empty, full of darkness and the
          distant sound of rushing water. It's quieter here than elsewhere
        in the world below-- no subway sounds, no tapping. The tunnel
          extends as far as we can see, vanishing in the distance. Its
        roof, brick, arches overhead, but the floor is not visible at
        all. The walls descend steeply into utter blackness. The black
        mouths of a myriad of tunnels open onto this great space at a
        dozen different levels. A series of narrow brick LEDGES run along
        the walls, connecting the tunnel mouths. Here and there, a few
          arching BRIDGES of ancient brick cross the abyss, some high above


                                                                        (CONTINUED)        Rev. 8/03/8724.

        us, some far below. We SEE that several of these bridges are in
          ruins, their center spans collapsed. Various sections of the
          walls, ledges and bridges are festooned with a sort of Spanish
        moss which GLOWS with a soft violet phosphorescence, filling the
        huge chamber with a wan half-light.


        We PAN slowly down the tunnel, and find Vincent sitting in the
          center of one of the bridges, a hundred feet below the
          roof, his legs dangling over this great space as he gazes out
        into the darkness.

        The light of a torch appears in the tunnel mouth at the end of
        the bridge, and begins to cross the span.

          VINCENT

          sits silently as Father appears behind him, carrying a torch that
          does little to pierce the gloom of this place.

                          friends. We thought it was magic.

                        If you stand in just the right place,
                        you can hear sounds... whispers from

                        She cannot help being afraid. They've
                        built their world on fear, Vincent.
                        It's all they know.
                        In that city up there, it's all that
                        keeps them alive. They'd
                        be insane if they weren't afraid, with
                        the lives they're forced to live.

                        place beyond their madness and fear.

                        we played hide-and-seek, Father... but
                          before the game was over, they always
                        found me. Even here.



  39EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT39

          Cathy gets out of a cab in front of high-rise glass and steel
          office building. She rings the night bell, and a SECURITY GUARD
          comes to the door. She flashes her DA's identification, and he
          admits her. Through the glass, we SEE them talking for a
          moment, as he directs her.

          Mrs. Dalby, in her uniform, is at work cleaning as Cathy
          enters. She continues working all through their conversation,
          dusting, emptying wastebaskets, etc.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)                                                                                            26.

                        Mrs. Dalby? I'm Catherine Chandler,
                        from the DA's office.

                                        MRS. DALBY
                        When you people going to leave
                        me alone? I got work to do. I already
                        told the police everything I know.


                                        CATHY
                        This won't take long, I promise. You
                        said you never got a good look at the
                          slasher--

                                        MRS. DALBY
                        Don't you call him that! That man
                        saved me, and all you people want to
                        do is hunt him down like some animal.
                        Where were all of you when those boys
                        were kicking me?


          She turns her back to Cathy, empties a wastebasket, then
          relents a little and turns back.

                                        MRS. DALBY
                          I didn't see him. I told you people
                        that, I told you and told you. The
                        lights were going on and off. What
                        kind of subway is that, we can't even
                        keep the lights on?

                                        CATHY
                        Surely, when the lights went on, you
                        must have seen something, if only for
                          a second...

                                        MRS. DALBY

                        Maybe so.
                                (beat)
                        But I don't remember nothing.
                        I was on the floor, hurting. I still
                        have bruises where they kicked me. I
                        didn't see no part of that man.

      Cathy looks her in the eye for a long beat. Mrs. Dalby looks
      away. She's hiding something, and Cathy knows it.

                                    CATHY
                              (gently)

        Mrs. Dalby busies herself with her work, ignoring her. Cathy
        decides to take a risk.

                        Mrs. Dalby, I'm not even supposed to
                      be here.
                                (off her sharp look)
                        This is personal for me. I have... a
                        friend...
                                ~with great difficulty)
                        I think... I don't know what to think,
                      but I'm afraid that he might be...
                        involved... if you could only tell me
                        what you saw... anything... his
                        face... his hands...


        Mrs. Dalby looks at her for a long beat, then NODS.

                        just claws... and his face, I'll never
                        forget that face. . .
                                (more loudly)
                        He wasn't a man. He wasn't a human man
                        at all. He was like
                        an angel... a terrible angel, come to
                        save me.

        There's too much of as she REACTS with shock and
        dismay. Vincent in Mrs. Dalby's words.

        Everything is hazy and surreal.  Images from her memories
      and fears blur together:

              a clawed hand, wet with bloodb)

        c)Vincent's face, in a feral snarl

        g)the dark shape, more clear now, still pacing

      The word  claws  ECHOES over and over, louder, as the dark shape
        becomes Jace in his office. The camera ZOOMS IN on him, and over
      his shoulder, gleaming with reflected light, we SEE the metal
         TIGER CLAWS" on his wall.

      Cathy gets out of a cab and hurries up the steps. As she opens
      the doors, she glances at the building's cornice. Chiselled
      into the stone, very faint and eroded with age, are the words
        SEAMAN'S SAFE HAVEN.

      Jace rises from his desk and gives Cathy his most charming smile

                      track. You hear the street people talk

                        don't you see? Because they need to
                        believe. Inside, we're all children,

                        techniques in the world don't equal
                        what I learned from Isaac Stubbs in

                        That's the problem with doing
                        things your way. You believe in
                        rules, and the predators don't.

      several seats, a tiny balding OLD MAN sits clutching a metal cane,
      very alert. A TRANSIT COP enters through the door between cars,
      whaps the drunk across the heels with his nightstick. The man sits
      up groggily. The cop moves on
      to the next car. The drunk lies down and covers himself with
      newspapers again.

      We hear a soft THUMP.The old man looks UP, puzzled.

      The train stops. A PRETTY GIRL of about sixteen enters, dressed
      demurely. She's followed closely by a CREEP with long greasy hair.
      It's clear at once that he's bothering. her, and that she's scared
      and trying to get away from him. He sits right next to her.


                                      PRETTYGIRL
                      Leave me alone!

                      C'mon, baby. Don't be so mean to
                      me.

      She moves closer to the old man; he follows. She tires to
      get up again, but he pulls her into his lap.

                                      CREEP
                      Gimme a kiss, sweetie.

                      Don't touch me. Let me go.

    He pulls her to him for a kiss, and she BITS him, bloodying his
      lip, breaking free. She runs forward, toward the next car, but he
      gets up and goes after her.

      as she reaches the door, starts to slide it open. His hand SLAMS
      INTO FRAME, trapping her. He has her pinned against the door.

        The creep looks back and LAUGHS.

                        I'm real scared.

      He turns his attention back to the girl, begins to kiss her.

    The old man hesitates, looks back hefts his cane. But he hasn't
    got it in him. Be looks down, ashamed.

      He slides open the door. We see him REACT.  A
      clawed hand enters the frame and pushes him aside.

      She's stopped struggling. We HEAR the creep's rough breathing, her
      sobs. A large SHADOW falls across them both, and the girl REACTS
      with shock and then hope. A clawed hand enters the frame and grabs
      the creep's hair, yanking his head back sharply; as a second set of
      claws go his throat, poised to slash, we

      BACK TO THE SCENE

      The creep is dead on the floor, holding his throat, the vigilante
      standing over him. At the cop's shout he whirls around, and we
      catch a VERY BRIEF almost subliminal glimpse of a terrifying
      bestial face and clawed hands covered with fur. An expert karate
      kick sends the gun flying, and the cop drops to a knee, cradling a
      broken hand.

      as the cop tackles him. They grapple briefly, but it's no
      contest. The vigilante is faster and far stronger. He SHOVES the
      cop aside and RAKES him with a clawed hand. As the cop falls, the
      vigilante bounds onto the seat, reaches outside, grabs the roof
      with his claws, and pulls himself out and UP.

          The lights of the train are receding in the distance. The
            vigilante runs the other way down the track, stops, presses a
          clawed hand against what seems to be a section of solid wall. A
          section of wall PIVOTS to reveal a secret door. The vigilante
          vanishes inside it, and the door closes.

          When he's gone, a YOUNG GIRL steps silently from a shadowed
          alcove, staring at the false wall.

          Cathy is working late. A mug of cold coffee sits by her elbow, and
          her dining room table is covered with law books, legal pads,
          briefs, and a NEW YORK SUBWAY MAP. She's poring over the map when
          she hears a gentle TAPPING. She crosses to her bedroom. .

          Curtains have been drawn across the balcony, but Vincent's
          shadow is outlined clearly through them.        Rev. 8/03/8739.

                        There is too much fear in your world
                        already, Catherine. I could not bring
                        you more.

          dispenses sandwiches, pies, etc. Cathy hands her a quarter, Edie
        puts it in the slot, over and over again, until the machine
          delivers a plastic-wrapped microwave cheeseburger.

                        in a couple old newspaper indexes, but
                        just the name -- the stories aren't on
                          computer yet.
                                (off Cathy's reaction)
                        Don't look at me that way, girl.
                        I don't go digging round in no musty

                        water.

          Cathy smiles broadly, gets to her feet.

      walls lined ceiling to floor with bookshelves. Huge oversized
      volumes of bound newspapers from the 19th century line the
      shelves. Cathy CARRIES a dozen thick volumes to the table, sits,
      opens the first. DUST flies everywhere when she flips open the
      heavy cover. She begins to turn pages slowly, her eyes flicking
    over the columns of faded newsprint. Bright afternoon sunlight
      pours into the room through a window.

      Cathy is still at work, turning pages, though it's now night

        She breaks off as the taxi door OPENS, and Suki gets into the
        back seat beside her. At once, Cathy reacts, and grabs for a
          door, but the cab lurches into sudden motion. As it pulls away,
        we RACK FOCUS to see that Red is the Cabbie.

          Suki puts a hand on Cathy's arm, reassuring her.

          Jace is pacing restlessly when the door opens, and Red and Suki
          escort Cathy through the door. They remain by the door, flanking*
          it like a pair of sentinels.

                                        CATHY

                        Don't make this difficult, Cathy.
                        There's no need for melodrama.
                        I'm not going to hurt you.

          Cathy takes a seat. Red has her purse. He opens it, hands the
          folded sheet from the legal pad to Jace, who scans it briefly,
          shakes his head.*

65AINT. WHISPERING CHAMBER. NIGHT65A *

          Vincent stands on one of the ledges looking out over the abyss,
          his cloak swirling slightly in some wind that stirs from the
          gulfs below. There's a torch mounted in a stanchion in the wall,
          a book in Vincent's hand -- his finger marking a place, as if
          he'd just left off reading. His expression is melancholy,
          meditative.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)        Rev. 8/03/8747.

      He BEGINS TO WALK, slowly, going nowhere in particular, simply
        walking and brooding and savoring the vast silent immensity of
      this ancient "place.

      As he walks, we HEAR FAINT WHISPERINGS from the world above,
        carried down through the tunnels by the strange acoustics. The
        whispers COME AND GO in many different voices: each can be heard
      ONLY IN ONE PARTICULAR SPOT, so as Vincent walks there are brief
        wisps of conversation and longer moments where the only sounds are
        his ECHOING FOOTSTEPS in the stillness of this place.


                                        WHISPERING VOICE #1
                      ... Take the D train out to
                        Brighton Beach and change...

                                        WHISPERING VOICE #2
                      ... no , hustle, oughta trade the
                      bum, what's he batting now...

                      ... no, I mean it, really, that's not
                      just a line, you're something...


        Finally Vincent reaches a spot where the whispering is not a human
        voice, but MUSIC -- an orchestra playing Beethoven's Fifth. He
        STOPS at that spot to listen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                    (conciliatory)
                          Catherine, whoever he is, he has
                          nothing to fear from me. We're alike,
                        he and I. We're mirror images, twins.
                        We're the same...

          Cathy REACTS too quickly, and with horror -- Jace is
            articulating her deepest fear. Cathy gets up quickly.

                                        CATHY
                          I've had enough of this. Am I
                        going to be allowed to leave?


          Red and Suki exchange looks, but Jace seems calm enough.

                                        JACE
                        If you insist.

          He walks behind his desk, admires the array of weapons, then
          reaches out and touches the blade of the samurai sword.
          It swings down easily, we hear a loud CLICK, and a secret panel in
          the wall SWINGS OPEN, revealing a narrow spiral staircase. Jace
          holds the door open for Cathy.

                                        JACE
                        After you.


          Cathy backs away.

                                        CATHY
                          I don't think so.

                                        JACE
                          I insist.

          He gestures, and Red and Suki step forward to either side of

          Cathy. She looks back and forth, surrenders, and enters the
          stairs. . .

        Jace follow, with Suki bringing up the rear. They enters a LARGE
          UNDERGROUND CHAMBER where their footsteps ECHO. Jace finds a
          Coleman lantern, lights it, brings up the flame, and hangs it from
        an iron hook in the wall. The room is still dark and gloomy. Cathy
        looks around nervously.

          hear her again more clearly. It's definitely Cathy.

          Something in their faces makes Cathy TURN as she hears the
          footstep behind her.

        JACE

        steps out of the darkness. His face is covered by some kind of mask
        -- primitive, perhaps tribal, with long strands of coarse hair,
        brutal slashes across the cheeks, long glittering teeth. His eyes
        seem to SHINE in the dim lantern light: red, demonic, merciless.
        He's dressed entirely in black, and on his hands are his claws --
        not metal ninja claws like those in his office( but animal claws
        six inches long, from some huge bear perhaps, mounted in fur-and-
          leather gauntlets that lace half way up his forearms. The familiar
          handsome, charming, articulate Jason Walker is gone entirely,
          submerged in this primal and frightening figure.


        CATHY

        She knows it's Jace -- but it isn't, not entirely. She gasps
        and shies away.

          is in real danger, his empathy draws him to her. He moves very
          fast, his face showing his concern.

          She twists upward on Cathy's arm, and Cathy winces. But she still
          won't talk. Jace steps closer, silent, and brings his hand up
          under her chin. He presses gently. We see the
          claws begin to dig into her flesh.

          Behind them, Vincent steps into view in one of the black
          tunnel mouths, and ROARS. Seeing Cathy in danger, he charges
          across the room.

          Jace WHIRLS, all catlike grace and lightning-quick reflexes,
            instinctively prepared to face this new danger before he even
          quite sees him. Vincent goes for him, but Jace does a flying ninja
          leap over Vincent's head, spinning in midair,
          and lands behind him. .

          For a split-second he's in a position to rake Vincent from behind,

          STUNNED, he freezes. He is the imitation come face-to-face with
          the real thing, and his astonishment makes him hesitate for just
          an instant too long.

          Vincent BACKHANDS him savagely, and Jace goes flying across the
          room, slamming into a wall, and sliding down stunned.

          BACK TO THE SCENE

          Cathy takes advantage of the distraction. She SLAMS her elbow back
          into Suki, breaks her hold, grabs the other woman by the wrist, and
          gives her a shoulder flip. Suki slams into the ground, stays down.

            Simultaneously, Red goes into a karate stance and give an EAR-
            SPLITTING KARATE YELL. Vincent answers with a ROAR that shakes the
          room. Red changes his mind, drops his hands, and runs like hell in
          the other direction. Vincent, his face a mask of bestial rage, all
          mercy and compassion gone from him, starts to follow, but Cathy
          REACTS and steps quickly in his way.

          hard in his life. He considers his situation briefly, then darts
          for the nearest exit (a different exit from the one Vincent
          emerged through). Vincent sees him
          run, and follows.

          b) Jace scrambles down a ladder as fast as he can go,


          c) Vincent reaches the tunnel fork, hesitates, looks down both
            branches, then goes right,

          d) Jace runs down a steamy tunnel, pipes covering the walls, steam
          rising around him, his footsteps ECHOING,



                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      54.

  e) Vincent descends the ladder,

  f) Jace emerges through an access door onto a catwalk in a
    cavernous chamber, looks back, listens, hears distant footsteps.
  He glances in both directions along the catwalk, then climbs up on
    the rail and LEAPS OUT over empty space, catching hold of one of
    the overhead pipes, and begins to SWING across from pipe to pipe,

  g) Vincent charges through the steamy tunnel, the echoes loud
    around him, emerges through the accessway just in time to SEE Jace
    vanish through a door on the far side. He looks for a way to
    cross, finds none, climbs atop the rail. But instead of crossing
  as Jace did, Vincent goes from one side to the other with a single
    stupendous leap.


  h) Jace dashes down an old section of tunnel. The floor DESCENDS
    sharply, and half the time he's scrambling and sliding downhill.
  He keeps looking back over his shoulder. We HEAR Vincent's
    pursuit. A dimly-lit opening appears at the tunnel's end in front
  of Jace. He goes through it, stops dead.

    As Vincent tries to speak, Jace ATTACKS. He flies forward, hits
    Vincent with a piston kick, slashing at him with a clawed hand.
    Vincent dodges the blows. For a moment, high atop the bridge, they
    fight -- Jace attacking with his razor-sharp claws, Vincent
      defending himself against a flurry of blows. Jace is very fast,
    and finally he RAKES Vincent across the chest.

    VINCENT

    Blood wells from the slashes Jace has left and Vincent ROARS with
    pain. The humanity falls from his face as the beast emerges,
    ferocious and implacable. He ROARS again, deafeningly, enraged,
    and the sound ECHOES and RE-ECHOES up and down the whispering
      chamber.

    JACE

    snaps his head around wildly, as the echoes make it seem as if he
    were surrounded by a dozen beasts. Vincent LUNGES, slams into
    Jace, and carries both of them off of the bridge into the abyss.

    VINCENT AND JACE

still struggling together as they fall. They SLAM into a second
bridge with Vincent, underneath, taking the full brunt of the
blow.

ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

The brick is very old, and they've landed hard. The bridge begins
to collapse beneath them, huge sections tumbling down into the
abyss.

JACE AND VINCENT

  Jace manages to roll to safety as the bricks fall away from
    beneath Vincent, leaving him suspended above an endless drop.
    Vincent catches hold with one hand.

 JACE

  stands over Vincent, draws back to strike the blow that will send
  Vincent plunging to his death... and then hesitates.
We INTERCUT quickly between Vincent's eyes and Jace's, peering
  through his hideous mask. He does not strike. Instead, he whirls,
runs, and jumps across the dark chasm, for the other side of the
fallen bridge, as Vincent climbs to safety.

           POV80VINCENT S



        of Jace, in SLOW MOTION, vaulting gracefully across space,
        glancing back for one last look at Vincent. The jagged remnant
        of the bridge is festooned with the glowing moss. Jace can't
        quite make the distance, but his hands close around the hanging
        strands of moss. He starts to pull himself up.

        CLOSE ON JACE'S HANDS


        as his claws begin to RIP at the moss, and it shreds and
          disintegrates in his grip.

        ANGLE DOWN PAST VINCENT

        as the moss TEARS and Jace, still silent, begins to fall, twisting
        round and round and round until his body is lost in the darkness
        below.

                                                                      CUT TO:


81EXT. CATHY'S BALCONY. DAWN81

        Cathy, wearing a robe over her thin nightgown, shivers as
        Vincent tells her of Jace's fate.

                                      CATHY
                        Then you never found a body?

                                        VINCENT
                        The children say that abyss goes
                        down forever. Too deep and too
                        dangerous for us to plumb. He's
                        dead, Catherine...
                                  (softly)*
                        and his shadow has lifted from*
                        your heart.*

        Cathy smiles a sweet, sad smile for him, and we know that he's*
        right, that her fear is gone. Then she turns and looks out over*
        the breaking dawn.*

                                                                        (CONTINUED)  81CONTINUED:81

                                      CATHY "*
                      The killings will stop, but...
                      they'll never know... never know
                      if he's dead or gone or just...
                      waiting... waiting down there until
                      he's needed again... like King
                      Arthur.
                                (bittersweet smile)
                      I think Jace would like that.

                              (beat) "
                      Bow can one man have so much
                      courage and passion and empathy
                      and so little mercy?

                                      VINCENT*
                      Perhaps he lost it somewhere,
                      Catherine. But he found it again, in
                      the end.


      They embrace for a long beat, as the sun comes up over the city..
