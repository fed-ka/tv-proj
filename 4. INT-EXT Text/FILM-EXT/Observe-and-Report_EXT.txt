ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT FROM THE BACK.
A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the
mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN
ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
the old women. They SCREAM!
The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the
skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the
sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
them.
The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running
and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR.
The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY,
flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and
flashes ANOTHER GIRL.
It's an all-out Pervert assault!
The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a
fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as
quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an
assassination.
A garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped-up ORANGE
GOLF CART. There's a siren on top that spins around.
The man driving is RONNIE BARNHARDT (28), a stocky mall
security guard whose expression reads all business.
Ronnie pulls out of the garage...
SUPERIMPOSE:
OBSERVE AND REPORT
3.
HEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages
through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they
see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater
grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a
car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over.
Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He
looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max.
The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One
skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking
lot.
The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent
orange siren and gives chase.
As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls
up and drives alongside of them.
RONNIE
(cop authority voice)
Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!
STEVIE, the leader of the skaters, yells back.
STEVIE
Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a
parking lot.
RONNIE
Sir, pull over to the sidewalk,
NOW!
HECTOR, another skater, joins in.
HECTOR
Leave us alone.
STEVIE
Yeah, skating's not a crime, dick.
RONNIE
Skateboarding is not allowed on
mall premises. Pull over now!
STEVIE
We're not leaving.
HECTOR
Yeah, fuck you!
The skateboarders flip Ronnie off and push hard to get
away from him. Ronnie guns it and an all out chase
ensues.
(CONTINUED)
4.
CONTINUED:
Ronnie pulls up alongside of a SLOW SKATER. Ronnie side-
swipes the skater, forcing the skater to run into a trash
can and fall.
Ronnie catches up to ANOTHER SKATER. This time, Ronnie
tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too
fast. Ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges
and ducks. Ronnie hits the brake. The skater thinks he
has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his
way. The skater nails the car and is thrown over the
hood.
Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie
are left. Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely
behind the two kids.
Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind. Hector
wobbles. Ronnie rams him again. Hector goes swerving
off and falls down hard.
Ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward Stevie.
Stevie is good. He turns and rides through cars, ollies
over parking blocks, and through pedestrians. Ronnie
burns down the lane beside him.
Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight.
He's
in the clear.
Stevie turns back around and sees Ronnie, driving in
reverse straight towards him. Ronnie rams into the
skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass.
STEVIE
What the fuck are you doing?
RONNIE
I was driving in reverse and
trying to get you to flip into the
back seat.
STEVIE
What?
RONNIE
That way I could handcuff you
smoothly and take you in. You
know, never mind, just get in the
goddamn golf cart.
Stevie picks himself up slowly and hobbles toward the
golf cart.
5.
Ronnie stands in front of a Cadillac with a boot on one
of his tires.
A local news camera crew comes up to Ronnie and the
FEMALE REPORTER starts asking questions.
FEMALE REPORTER
Excuse me, sir, but we would like
to ask you a few questions.
RONNIE
I'm sorry, but I can't answer
anything.
FEMALE REPORTER
We heard a report that an
unidentified man was spotted
earlier today exposing himself to
several women. Do you care to
comment?
RONNIE
I'm not allowed to comment on that
situation.
FEMALE REPORTER
So you admit there is a situation.
RONNIE
I'm trained to resist torture for
up to 72 hours, you really expect
me to break now? Get real, lady.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
FEMALE REPORTER
(to her camera crew)
We're wasting our time here.
Let's go find some police to
interview.
RONNIE
Good luck.
FEMALE REPORTER
What's that supposed to mean?
RONNIE
It just means you won't find any
police.
FEMALE REPORTER
Are you telling me the police
haven't even been called!
RONNIE
(SARCASTIC)
Ewww, alert the media.
FEMALE REPORTER
Jesus, well who'd they leave in
charge, you?
Ronnie smiles like he knows a secret.
FEMALE REPORTER
Yeah, right. Why would they leave
you in charge?
RONNIE
First of all, if there was a
situation to be handled, I don't
see why you find it so goddamn
ridiculous that I would be in
charge.
The Reporter waves for her crew to start filming.
FEMALE REPORTER
(setting a trap)
Look, there is no way you're in
charge of this investigation.
RONNIE
Well for your information, I'm in
charge of this whole fucking
operation.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
RONNIE (CONT'D)
I don't give a goddamn if you
believe me or not, Ms. Hot Fuckin'
SHIT news lady. I'm the first
line of defense against this
pervert. As the law's right hand,
I'm here so that people like you
can live in your own little happy
world and think places like this
mall are safe and fun. I'm the
defender of this war zone. Just
me and my goddamn flashlight.
Just then, SADDAMN, an angry Middle Easterner with
shitloads of cell phones and beepers strapped to him,
comes running up to Ronnie.
SADDAMN
You motherfucker, you put a boot
on my car!
RONNIE
(cop voice)
I warned you about parking in the
fire lane, Saddamn!
SADDAMN
Fuck you, Ronnie! Take that
goddamn boot off of my car.
RONNIE
(going into cop
VOICE)
Step away now!
SADDAMN
I pay good money to this mall.
Don't tell me where to park!
RONNIE
Sir, I will be forced to take
action if you do not step back!
SADDAMN
I'm gonna kill you!
Ronnie pulls out his taser and shoots Saddamn. Saddamn
goes down hard and begins twitching. He is fucking out
of it!
Ronnie goes back to giving the interview as if nothing
happened.
(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:
RONNIE
As I was saying, the pervert
situation here is real bleak. For
all you people out there thinking
of coming to the mall, please for
your own safety, stay away.
SADDAMN
(still fucked up)
I can't believe you tased me.
RONNIE
(to the man)
That's right and I've got another
one waiting right here for you.
CUT TO:
Ronnie's home is a shitty double-wide at the very end of
the shittiest trailer park in town.
17.
LOUD ROCK SCORE FADES TO LOUD ROCK SOURCE. A tricked-out
Toyota pulls up to the parking lot. The car comes to a
stop and out steps Brandi, the makeup counter girl.
Brandi walks toward the mall to start her new day. As
she crosses the parking lot and heads toward the door,
the Pervert pops out. This time, he's upped his attack
and beats off staring right at her.
The horrendous sight stops Brandi dead in her tracks.
She SCREAMS bloody murder...
CUT TO:
A black UNMARKED POLICE CAR pulls up quickly and stops
directly in front of the Main Entrance to the mall as if
to say to the world, "I'm a Cop and I can do this."
Out steps DETECTIVE HARRISON, a young cop that has the
arrogance and swagger of a man who is just beginning to
feel his power.
Ronnie strolls through the mall sipping on his morning
coffee. He stops when he sees that the jewelry store has
been broken into and robbed.
RONNIE
Oh shit.
Ronnie goes running down through the mall.
Ronnie and Brandi pull up to Brandi's car in the golf
cart.
BRANDI
Alright, thanks for the ride.
RONNIE
Just doing my job with a little
something extra especially for
you.
BRANDI
See ya tomorrow.
RONNIE
Brandi, um... I was just thinking,
would you like to go to dinner
this weekend?
BRANDI
How come every time somebody does
something nice for me, they act
like I owe them a blow job?
RONNIE
Look, it's not like that. I've
got a girlfriend... who doesn't
work in this mall.
BRANDI
Ronnie, I got to be honest with
you, you're not really my type.
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
RONNIE
Just out of curiosity, what is
your type?
BRANDI
Rich guys.
Or guys who are really
hot.
RONNIE
Yeah, I guess that's not me.
BRANDI
I'll go out to dinner with you on
one condition.
RONNIE
What's that?
BRANDI
This is not a date. Do you
understand? We're going to
dinner, but we are not going on a
date.
RONNIE
Done.
BRANDI
And you can never tell anybody we
went out.
RONNIE
My lips are sealed.
BRANDI
You pay for dinner, right?
And as
many drinks as I want.
RONNIE
You may drink your fill.
BRANDI
And you have to drive me to my car
every night after work for the
next six months.
RONNIE
You got it.
BRANDI
And my car is low on gas, so I
need some money to fill it up.
Ronnie takes out his wallet.
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
RONNIE
Is $20 enough?
BRANDI
Nah, fifty.
Ronnie takes out more money and hands it to Brandi.
She
takes it, counts it, and puts it into her bra.
BRANDI
Okay, you can pick me up after
work on Saturday. Dinner and
that's it. Don't try to kiss me
because I'll smack the shit out of
you. It's not a date.
RONNIE
Got it.
Not a date.
BRANDI
Thanks for the ride.
Brandi climbs out of the golf cart and walks to her car.
She opens the door and starts to get in --
RONNIE
Hey, Brandi.
BRANDI
What?
RONNIE
I lied.
It is a date.
Before she can argue, Ronnie guns the golf cart and
drives away.
Ronnie sees Stevie and the Skaters doing hand rails down
a ramp while mall patrons try to get by without getting
nailed by flying skateboards. Ronnie drives up on his
golf cart.
STEVIE
Our suspension is over.
RONNIE
I'm not here for that.
I need to
talk to you.
A giant BODYGUARD with a shaved head stands up.
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
BODYGUARD
Anything you want to say to
Stevie, you can say to me,
motherfucker!
RONNIE
Who the fuck are you?
STEVIE
This is my cousin, Roy.
He's a
boxer.
BODYGUARD
You got a fuckin' problem, bitch?!
Ronnie reaches into his belt and produces a can of mace.
He sprays it into the eyes of the Bodyguard. The guy
goes down and starts SCREAMING IN PAIN.
BODYGUARD
My eyes!
STEVIE
Jesus, Ronnie, what the fuck are
you doing?
RONNIE
I need a favor.
STEVIE
I'm listening.
RONNIE
As you know, we've had a lot of
crime around here lately. Between
the Flasher and all the break-ins,
I've decided to go to the streets.
Frankly, I'm looking for a stool
pigeon and you're just the right
person.
STEVIE
Why would I want to help you?
RONNIE
I could make it worth your while.
You like skating at the mall. I
could allow you to skate here
whenever you wanted. In exchange,
you keep your eyes peeled and
provide me with any information
you come across as to the identity
of the perpetrators.
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
STEVIE
Sorry, dude, but I'm no snitch.
Go find somebody else to do your
dirty work.
RONNIE
Well, let me put it another way.
If you don't help me, I'm gonna
spread your little butt cheeks and
stick this flashlight up your ass.
But like for real. Like I really
will do that. This is the new me
talking and I get what I need, you
understand me, Stevie?
STEVIE
Alright, dude, I understand, you
sick fuck.
RONNIE
Cool. In that case, have fun
shreadin'.
Ronnie gets into his Golf Cart and drives off. Stevie
looks down at the Boxer who is still on the ground.
STEVIE
Stop crying, Roy.
Stevie starts skating.
Ronnie opens Brandi's door and helps Brandi out. She's
almost passed out drunk. Both of her eyes are closed and
she immediately tries to sleep on the ground. Ronnie
helps her up, but when he does, Brandi gives him a
kiss -- a sloppy one.
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
RONNIE
Brandi, I had a wonderful time
tonight.
BRANDI
I'm so fucking shit-faced.
They kiss again, but when they do, Brandi pukes all over
the place. It's a disgusting puke and there's vomit on
her cheek and stuff. Ronnie holds her head for her.
RONNIE
Are you okay?
BRANDI
My breath smells like asshole.
Ronnie looks longingly into her eyes.
RONNIE
I love you, Brandi.
BRANDI
I think I've got puke in my teeth.
RONNIE
I don't care.
Ronnie kisses Brandi passionately on the mouth. He walks
her inside the house. On the way in, she falls over.
Ronnie helps her up. He carries her into the house where
the make-love spot is.
CUT TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
Ronnie looks petrified as he stands guard.
A BUM stands
off to the side staring Ronnie down.
Ronnie waves to the bum. The bum runs his finger under
his throat. Ronnie tries to ignore him.
A group of KIDS walk by Ronnie talking loudly.
RONNIE
Hey, no horse play. You guys get
on home.
KID
You want some crack?
RONNIE
No, I don't want any crack. In
fact, I didn't want to do this,
but you leave me no choice in the
matter. I'm placing you under
citizen's arrest.
Ronnie grabs the little Kid by the shoulders to restrain
him.
KID
Let me go, motherfucker!
RONNIE
I place you under citizen's arrest
for the crime of selling a
Schedule 1 Narcotic. You have the
right to remain silent...
Unbeknownst to Ronnie, Gang Members start walking up
behind him. It's like that scene in Training Day where
all the gangsters are hanging out right across the street
with guns and shit. They come up behind him as he speaks
to the kids...
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:
RONNIE
... If you cannot afford an
attorney, one will be appointed to
you. Now I guess we just wait
here for my ride to come back.
Ronnie turns around to look for Harrison's return, but
instead he sees that he is surrounded by a large group of
pissed-off GANG MEMBERS.
GANG MEMBER #1
That's my little brother you got
there.
RONNIE
Who, this little guy right here?
GANG MEMBER #1
That's right.
RONNIE
Well, I hate to be the one to tell
you this, but it appears that your
little brother has tried to sell
me illegal drugs. I know it's
hard for you to hear that.
GANG MEMBER #1
He works for me, motherfucker!
RONNIE
Is that so? Well then, it looks
like you got one less employee
because I'm taking little brother
down. I'll die right here before
I let crime prevail.
The Gang Members all pull out their guns and point them
at Ronnie.
RONNIE
(to the little Kid)
Free to go, little brother. My
mistake completely. Good luck
with the crack.
The little Kid runs off.
RONNIE
Alright, so I guess I'll be seeing
you folks.
The Gang Members stand in Ronnie's way and cock their
guns.
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
GANG MEMBER #2
Yo, waste this pig, Tone.
RONNIE
Oh, no. That's really not
necessary, Tone.
GANG MEMBER #2
Do it, man.
Gang Member #1 puts the gun right up to Ronnie's head.
RONNIE
Oh, Jesus, I don't want to die.
Don't let me die, don't do it!
Ronnie goes down on his knees.
RONNIE
No, please!
I'm sorry!
Ronnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod.
He flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick.
Ronnie's begging was a trap. Ronnie pops up and begins
dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning-fast
precision.
Ronnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja.
Gang Member #1 comes in and hits Ronnie with a sucker
punch, busting his nose wide open.
Ronnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight
with Gang Member #1. He starts kicking Ronnie's ass.
Ronnie goes down again and Gang Member #1 starts stomping
Ronnie.
Ronnie grabs Gang Member #1's leg and twists it. He
takes him down. Ronnie jumps on top of him and begins
beating him senseless.
SLOW MOTION: Ronnie stands up and looks around at the
pool of beaten bodies. This is Ronnie at his most primal
and also at his best.
CUT TO:
Mark sits behind his desk reading a paper. The HEADLINE
READS: CHAOS CLIMBS AT CAROLINA MALL. There's a KNOCK
at the door.
MARK
Come in.
Ronnie sticks his head in the door.
RONNIE
Good morning, Mark.
MARK
Is it, Ronnie? I mean, the mall
is getting butchered in the press.
Somebody who works here is ripping
the place off. The cops don't
have any leads. I'm getting shit
from the owner of the mall. Sales
are down. I mean, what's so good
about this morning?
RONNIE
I feel your pain, Mark. Quite
frankly, there's two things
happening. One, I'm lacking a
sufficient firearm. And two,
we're understaffed. That's why I
come to you this morning with a
plan.
(calling to the door)
Come on in, Charles.
Charles opens the door and walks in.
MARK
Who is this?
RONNIE
This is Charles, sir.
CHARLES
(BOUNCER)
How's it going?
MARK
You work at O'Charley's, right.
CHARLES
That's right.
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
RONNIE
Mark, I would like to hire Charles
here as an additional Security
Guard. He would operate under me.
I figure with the additional
criminal element, we should hire
more security in hopes that we
would have a better chance of
catching these guys.
MARK
Do you have any experience, son?
CHARLES
Not really.
RONNIE
Um, sir, I have personally been
training young Charles for weeks
now in preparation for this day.
The kid kind of looks up to me.
I'm some what of a big brother to
the little guy.
Charles kind of looks at Ronnie like he's crazy.
MARK
Alright, it's actually not a bad
idea. It might make our Security
more visible so we can give people
the illusion that we're on top of
this.
Ronnie winks at Charles.
CHARLES
Thank you, Mark.
MARK
Ronnie, one more thing. Look, if
this crime doesn't come to an end
pretty soon, we're gonna have to
let someone go. I mean, you've
always done a great job for me,
but the truth is, someone is going
to have to take the fall. You're
the one who wanted to be Head of
Mall Security and quite frankly, I
just bought my wife a new
Cadillac, so let's just say it
won't be me.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
RONNIE
With Charles on my team, I can now
devote more time to the robbery
and Pervert case. I plan on
having these wrapped up by the end
of the week.
Mark laughs to himself.
RONNIE
Why'd you just laugh?
MARK
It's nothing.
Have fun, Ronnie.
Ronnie looks at Charles.
RONNIE
Did I say something funny?
CHARLES
Let's go, Ronnie.
Ronnie and Charles take off.
The Police Academy is full of energy as new recruits pour
up the steps and into the building, eager to start their
training.
Ronnie comes walking up and takes a long look at the
building. Ronnie smiles to himself and heads up the
stairs.
Ronnie reaches the top where Detective Harrison is
waiting. Ronnie stops.
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
RONNIE
Ronnie Barnhardt reporting for
duty.
DETECTIVE HARRISON
I can see that. Listen, I don't
really know how to say this, but
we're not going to be able to let
you join the academy.
RONNIE
What?!
Why not?
DETECTIVE HARRISON
It seems you had a little trouble
passing the minimum requirements.
RONNIE
Did I fail one of the tests?
DETECTIVE HARRISON
Well, yes, actually, you failed
the psychological exam.
RONNIE
No!
DETECTIVE HARRISON
It says...
(reads from the form)
That Ronnie Barnhardt shows
warning signs of delusion and
allowing him to join the force
puts his life and the lives of
others in jeopardy.
RONNIE
Detective Harrison, you've got to
believe me. I'm completely sound.
This has got to be a mistake.
DETECTIVE HARRISON
Ronnie, I personally did your
background check and this is the
fifth time you've been turned down
for the police academy.
RONNIE
You guys keep records on that?
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
DETECTIVE HARRISON
We sure do. Look, I tried to talk
to them, but there's no way
they're gonna let you in. I'm
sorry, but your dreams of becoming
a Police Officer just aren't going
to happen.
RONNIE
I understand. Thanks for
believing in me, Detective. And
just for the record, I'm not
crazy.
DETECTIVE HARRISON
Take care, Ronnie.
Detective Harrison goes inside and closes the doors on
Ronnie.
Ronnie stands outside of the closed academy by himself.
The CAMERA PUSHES INTO Ronnie and SPINS UPSIDE-DOWN.
CUT TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
Ronnie sits in his golf cart staring at the mall as the
last of the customers leave. That's when Ronnie sees
Brandi come out of the door. Brandi looks around and
darts across the parking lot.
Ronnie follows Brandi's path and tries to catch up with
her.
Ronnie drives around, but he can't find Brandi anywhere.
Ronnie sees a lone black car at the outer edge of the
parking lot. He pulls his golf cart over and climbs out.
Ronnie creeps up to the car and peers in the window.
Inside, Ronnie sees Brandi and Detective Harrison banging
like a couple of wild animals.
Ronnie jumps back in shock!
Ronnie runs around Detective Harrison's car wielding a
flashlight like a mad man.
RONNIE
HARRISON!!!
Ronnie beats the shit out of Harrison's car.
He smashes
headlights, mirrors and fenders.
INSIDE THE CAR
Harrison and Brandi duck down.
BRANDI
Shit!
DETECTIVE HARRISON
That motherfucker is crazy.
BRANDI
Well, you're the fucking cop.
Do
something.
DETECTIVE HARRISON
You're right.
Okay, here it goes.
Harrison reaches over Brandi and opens her door.
BRANDI
What the fuck are you doing?!
Harrison pushes Brandi out of the car and shuts himself
back in.
OUTSIDE
Ronnie sees Brandi and stops pummeling the car.

BRANDI
Ronnie, it's me! Don't do
anything crazy.
RONNIE
Get back inside, Brandi. This
isn't about you... you... you
slut!
BRANDI
Fuck off, Ronnie.
RONNIE
How can you just stand there after
you ruined my life and act like
nothing happened?!
BRANDI
It's easy 'cause I don't give a
FUCK ABOUT YOU!
Ronnie SNAPS. He charges at Brandi with the flashlight
over his head. He's about to crack her when...
CLICK.
Ronnie STOPS to see Harrison on the other side of him
with his pistol drawn and pointed at Ronnie.
DETECTIVE HARRISON
Drop the flashlight, Ronnie.
Ronnie drops the flashlight from his hands.
RONNIE
You're pretty tough with that gun.
DETECTIVE HARRISON
Ronnie, I know you've had a hard
time --
RONNIE
You were supposed to be my friend!
DETECTIVE HARRISON
So you're gonna kill Brandi?
RONNIE
I was just trying to scare her.
BRANDI
You don't scare me, you piece of
shit.
(CONTINUED)
99.

Ronnie lifts the flashlight up again like he's going to
hit Brandi. Brandi ducks.
Detective Harrison cocks the gun.
DETECTIVE HARRISON
Ronnie!
RONNIE
Fine, fuck you! Fuck all of you!
And, Harrison, you better be glad
you have a gun or I'd kick your
ass too. And you know what? I'm
taking my friendship back because
you don't deserve it! And,
Brandi, I'm taking my love back
too. I'm gonna leave now and you
two can just have fun. Have fun
sleeping tonight because something
tells me, you won't be able to.
Ronnie climbs into the golf cart and drives off.
DETECTIVE HARRISON
That guy is a nut job.
BRANDI
Tell me about it.
DETECTIVE HARRISON
So you slept with him?
BRANDI
I was drunk okay. You gonna make
a big deal out of it.
DETECTIVE HARRISON
No, I guess not.
BRANDI
Fine.
Dennis and Ronnie hang in the back of the mall by the
dumpsters. Dennis sucks down a fat joint. He passes it
to Ronnie.
DENNIS
So, yeah, usually I take a joint
straight to the head before I
start work in this motherfucker,
but on really stressful days, I
like to get drunk too.
Dennis pulls out a flask and gulps it down. Ronnie is
still staring at the joint. Finally he takes a puff and
begins violently coughing. He finally stops.

Dennis hands Ronnie the bottle and he takes a big swig.

Ronnie is smoking a joint and so is Dennis.
DENNIS
Right before lunch I usually blaze

Dennis and Ronnie walk by the skaters.
DENNIS
Hey, what's up, motherfuckers?!
STEVIE
What up, Big Den?!
DENNIS
You know, smokin' that good good.
STEVIE
Dude, why are you hanging out with
Ronnie?
RONNIE
Fuck you, Stevie!
DENNIS
Hey, Ronnie's alright.
Let me see
that stick.
Stevie slides the skateboard over to Dennis. He jumps on
it and does a perfectly executed kick flip. The skaters
cheer!
Ronnie and Dennis are driving in the golf cart and
they're both wearing those GIANT SUNGLASSES that they won
with arcade tickets. Behind them, Stevie and the other
Skaters hold onto the golf cart and get pulled on their
skateboards.
They race towards a loading ramp. Dennis floors it and
they go up the ramp and JUMP the golf cart into the air.
The golf cart and Skaters soar into the air. It holds
forever, until suddenly, the golf cart lands with a thud.
CUT TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
Dennis pulls out of the mall driving a HARLEY DAVIDSON.
He flips a joint into the air and peels out. He cruises
down the street. He passes a cop car and flips it off.
CUT TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
Ronnie walks up the steps that lead to the local jail.
The golf cart pulls up to the police station and Ronnie
gets out with the Perv. Ronnie walks up the front steps
and all of the officers part and let him through.
Detective Harrison is at the top of the stairs.
Ronnie
walks right up to him.
RONNIE
I caught the Pervert.

DETECTIVE HARRISON
I see that. Well, you better turn
him over to me and I'll take him
inside and book him.
RONNIE
Since you're a real Cop, right?
DETECTIVE HARRISON
Hey, Ronnie, you may not be an
officer of the law, but you're the
law's right hand. Good job.
Ronnie lets go of the Pervert. He nods to Harrison, then
turns his back and walks back down the steps. Ronnie
gets into his golf cart and drives away.
CUT TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
Ronnie stands in front of the Mall with Nell beside him.
Ronnie looks nervous, but Nell looks down at her yellow
ring with pride. She looks at Ronnie, sees a loose
eyelash and brushes it off of him.
RONNIE
What are you doing?!
NELL
You had an eyelash?
RONNIE
I'm trying to remember my speech.
NELL
Sorry.
Nell looks straight ahead, but smiles as Ronnie tries to
take himself serious.
FEMALE REPORTER
Okay, Ronnie, we're ready for you.
Ronnie takes a deep breath and walks over to where the
LOCAL NEWS has set up a camera and microphone.
FEMALE REPORTER

FEMALE REPORTER
Good evening. We're here today
with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of
Mall Security here at Carolina
Mall. Last week, Ronnie was able
to catch The CAROLINA MALL FLASHER
single-handed and bring him to
justice. Ronnie, how did you
manage to find the identity of The
Pervert and take him down?
RONNIE
Well, being a mall security guard
basically requires the same skill
set that someone in say the FBI
has. You have to use logic and
evidence and old-fashioned common
sense as well as the latest
technology to deduce the criminal
mind. It's what I do.
All of a sudden, STEVIE AND THE SKATERS come up behind
Ronnie. They look into the camera lens and start
smiling. Ronnie turns around and sees them, but tries to
focus on the reporter.
FEMALE REPORTER
Any last words for the folks at
home.
RONNIE
Yeah, I'd just like to say that
Carolina Mall is back on track and
safer than ever...
The Skaters start flipping off the camera.
Ronnie keeps
getting distracted.
RONNIE
In fact, there are some wonderful
sales taking place right now.
Stevie walks up behind Ronnie and pretends to hump him.
RONNIE
So for all you families out there,
come on down and see us. It's a
wonderful place.
Ronnie turns around angrily.
RONNIE
THAT'S IT, YOU LITTLE SHIT!

CONTINUED:
THE SKATERS jump on their skateboards and skate off.
Ronnie runs after them. He jumps into his GOLF CART and
gives chase.
The NEWS CAMERA is still rolling.
The FEMALE REPORTER
looks into the lens.
FEMALE REPORTER
You heard it, folks. Everything
is back to normal here at Carolina
Mall. Back to you, Lindsay.
CUT TO BLACK.
