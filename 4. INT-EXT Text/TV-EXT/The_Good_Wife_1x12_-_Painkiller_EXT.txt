      Alicia approaches a cheerful middle-class house, notices a 
    sad abandoned football on the lawn, sees a DELIVERY MAN 
      already waiting on the stoop with a large floral arrangement, 
       Condolences  on it.  Alicia nods to him, waits too.  

      Finally, the door opens.  TinaBowers.  Three days into a *
      lifetime of grief.  She notices the arrangement, nods, then 
      pauses, seeing Alicia, eyeing her...   

                                    TINABOWERS*
                    What are you doing here?  

      Tinatakes the delivery man s clipboard to sign...*

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sorry, Mrs. Bowers, I m just 
                    trying to piece together what 
                    happened--

                                    TINABOWERS*
                    No, you re trying to protect the 
                    doctor who killed my son.

    The delivery man looks between the two nervously.

                                  ALICIA
                    Look, I know your first instinct 
                    might be to slam the door in my face-
                    -

      And-- bang-- she slams the door in her face.  The delivery 
    man shoots Alicia a shrugging look then starts back toward 
    his van.  Alicia frowns-- what to do?  She rips out a piece 
    of notepaper, starts to write on it when-- 

                                    TINABOWERS*
                    Why are you fighting for him?  You 
                    should be fighting for me.   

      Alicia sees Tinaat her window, the screen obscuring her.  A *
      confessor s screen.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #111   "Painkiller"   YELLOW REVISIONS   11/30/09     20.

                    I want to know the truth.

                                    TINABOWERS*
                    No, you don t.  You re a lawyer.  
                    Everyone s painting my son as a 
                    drug addict.  As a...

                                  ALICIA
                    And everyone s painting Dr. Wesley 
                    as a pill pusher.  So help me.  
                    Help me find how these drugs got in 
                    Ben s system.  

      A beat.  Tinastares at her.  Then disappears from the *
      window.  Was that it?  Alicia sighs, pauses, when the door 
      opens.  Just a foot.


      A serious gym.  Not a chain.  Downtown.


      Knock-knock.  Alicia and Kalinda wait at a front door.  A 
      second.  Then TinaBowers opens the door.*

                                  ALICIA
                    Could we talk to you a second, Mrs. 
                    Bowers?
