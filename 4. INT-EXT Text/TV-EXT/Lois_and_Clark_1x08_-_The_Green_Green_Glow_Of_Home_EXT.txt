	A late model luxary car roars down the street.  Without
	warning, the CARJACKER slams on the brakes, bringing the
	car to a sudden stop.  Before him stands Superman.

	The carjacker tries to back up, but Superman grabs the
	front bumper, literally LIFTING THE CAR OFF THE GROUND,
	preventing it from moving.

	The carjacker jumps out of the car, races down the street.
	Suddenly, Superman is before him there, too.  The
	carjacker uses his weapon to rain a barrage of automatic
	weapons fire against Superman.  The Man of Steel literally
	CATCHES THE BULLETS IN MID-AIR.  As the smoke clears,
	Superman is still standing.  The carjacker, visibly
	shaken, throws down his weapon and slowly raises his hands
	in a gesture of surrender.

				CARJACKER
		Man, don't nothin' hurt you?

				SUPERMAN
		Not so far.

	Superman seems all powerful and invincible.  LIGHTNING
	illuminates the sky.

				IRIG
		You know that big oak tree I got

		blew it right out of the ground.

				JONATHAN
		Need some help chopping it up?

				IRIG
		No, uh-uh.  I found somethin' under
		that tree -- a rock -- and I sent a
		little bit off to the state lab to
		check out.  Today I got federal

	Irig holds out the box and Jonathan takes it.

	part harvest celebration.  Under the gazebo, a	*
	country-rock band plays MUSIC.	*

				CLARK
		If Irig's around, somebody here

		You're not here because of your
		environmental virtue any more than
		I am.  You know it and I know it.

	Lois and Clark trade looks.  Their old nemesis is back.

				CLARK
		What have you done with Wayne irig?

				TRASK
		I let him go.
			(beat)
		Small town ties mean a lot.  Anyone
		else would have given up their
		contact in a minute.  This man took
		sodium pentothal and a couple of
		broken fingers and he still didn't
		talk.  Then it came to me.  Let him
		go.

	Sherman emerges from the main tent.  Lois says to Trask:

				LOIS
		You're not as clever as you think.
		I knew she was a fake all along.

				TRASK
		Really?  How?

				LOIS
		Too competent to work for the
		government.
			(to Sherman)
		Sherman, how'd you get into this?

				TRASK
		You are starting to annoy me.
			(to agents)
		Get her out of my sight.

	Clark strains against his captors, but is, literally,
	powerless to stop them.  As they begin to hustle Lois
	away, she calls out to Sherman.

				LOIS
		Did they recruit you?  Did you
		think you were getting into
		government work?

				TRASK
		Shut up!

		Instead, you're a thug.  Is that

	inside.

				CLARK
		Lois!

				TRASK
		Relax, Mister Kent. My business is

	Jimmy stands looking through a camera with an extremely	*

	on the stake-out a while.

	Suddenly, he pays great attention, begins firing off a
	succession of shots.

35B	JIMMY'S POV - CLEAN-UP SITE			35B

	Clark is roughly being loaded into Trask's van by a couple
	of agents.


	Jimmy drives his car, frantically looking for a place to
	park.  He can't find one.  He stops the car in the middle
	of the street and jumps out.  People AD-LIB shouts at him,
	but he doesn't care.  Jimmy approaches a nearby sheriff's
	car sees Sheriff Rachel Harris talking with o deputies.

				JIMMY
			(addressing deputy)
		Sheriff, we got an emergency.

				RACHEL
			(correcting him)
		Over here.

	Jimmy does a double-take.  Rachel takes his keys, tosses
	them to the deputy.

				RACHEL
			(continuing)
		Hank, put his car somewhere legal,
		okay?
			(to Jimmy)
		If it's an emergency, you better
		start talking fast.

				JIMMY
		Okay, right.  There's a guy, his
		name's Trask, he thinks there are
		UFO's, I mean, there are UFO'S,
		but this guy collects them.
		Anyway he's here in Smallville and
		he's got my friends and we gotta go
		save them now or they're gonna be
		toast.  Do you know how to call	*
		the Army?  The National Guard?	*
		We're gonna need some kind of	*
		helicopter...	*

	Rachel looks at Jimmy carefully.  Should she arrest him or
	help him?

				RACHEL
		You're not from around here, are
		you?

				JIMMY
		My name's Jimmy Olsen.  I'm from
		Metropolis with the Daily Planet
		and my friends...

				RACHEL
		Get in.	*

	Jimmy gets in.  Rachel steps on the gas.  As they peel
	away...

				RACHEL (V.0.)
			(continuing)
		Did Clark ever mention me?

	WE SEE Jonathan, Martha and Irig as one of Trask's men
	leaves a gasoline trail across the hay, trailing outdoors.
	Trask delivers this parting shot:

				TRASK
		Remember, you give your lives in
		the cause of humanity.

					CUT TO:



	The sheriff's car is pulled over to the side.  Rachel
	tensely loads her weapon while Jimmy watches.

				JIMMY
		You ever fired that before?

				RACHEL
		Of course I've fired it.
			(confession)
		On the range.

	Jimmy nods.  Not exactly a confidence builder.

				RACHEL
			(continuing)
		This Lois.  Does she love Clark?

				JIMMY
		I don't think so.  She pretty much
		loves her work.

	Rachel finishes loading.  The two-way radio SQUAWKS to
	life.

				RADIO VOICE
		Base to Unit One.

				RACHEL
			(into two-way)
		Unit One, go ahead Base.

				RADIO VOICE
		I've got a woman on the line.
		She's talking about UFO'S,
		kidnappings, something about Wayne
		Irig and the Daily Planet and
		Superman.  I think it's a crank.

	Rachel and Jimmy trade a look.  Lois.

				RACHEL
		Put her through.  Go ahead, Lois.

		right away.  I think their lives
		are in danger.

				RACHEL
		Copy that.  But we're on our way to
		the Irig property to check out the
		trouble there first.

				LOIS
		Forget it!  That's where I am.
		Everybody else is gone.  Get to the
		Kent's.  Now!

	Jimmy gestures to take the microphone and she hands it over.

				JIMMY
		Lois, it's Jimmy.

				LOIS
		Jimmy!  Listen, I don't know
		exactly what's going on, but
		Superman's in danger, too.  We've
		got to warn him somehow.  Got any
		ideas?

	Jimmy looks down to his signal watch.

				JIMMY
		Just one.  But it's kind of a long
		shot.

				LOIS
		Try anything!

	Jimmy pokes his head out the window, looking upward toward
	the sky as he keys the signal watch.

				JIMMY
		Come one, big guy.  I promise to
		ask nice later.  But just this
		once...

	The car blasts off down the road, lights flashing, SIREN
	blaring.

					CUT TO:



	Trask throws a match to the ground and the trail of flame
	races toward the shed. The van is parked nearby, ready
	for the getaway. Clark suddenly BURSTS THROUGH THE BACK
	DOORS of the van.

	He sees the flames.  With his super-breath, he INHALES
	THE FLAMES, then he BLOWS THE FLAMES SKYWARD from his
	mouth like a human flame-thrower.



	Clark races inside, where Jonathan, Martha and Irig are
	held, begins to set Martha free first.  As he does, he
	whispers to Jonathan:

				CLARK
		Superman's back.

				MARTHA
		Clark!  Behind you.

	Clark turns, sees Trask approaching in the distance. He
	moves to the doorway.


	Clark exits the shed, moves to confront Trask, moving
	toward him, arms behind his back in a military "at ease"
	posture.
				CLARK
		Don't take another step.

				TRASK
		Fighting words, Mister Kent. Or
		should I call you, 'Superman?'
			(considers this)
		A secret identity. Very clever.

	Clark begins moving toward Trask, closing the gap.

				CLARK
		You're going to prison. For
		murder, kidnapping, for abuse of
		power.

				TRASK
		But I'll tell everyone your secret.

				CLARK
		I don't care.  This ends now,
		Trask.

				TRASK
		Agreed.  But the question is, for
		whom?

	In an instant, Clark CLOSES THE DISTANCE to Trask at
	SUPER SPEED.  Shock crosses his face.  Trask smiles.
	Behind his back, Trask has been holding the green rock.
	Clark recoils in searing pain, staggers back.  His knees
	begin to buckle.  Soon he collapses, fighting to even
	breathe.

	Trask stands towering over him.  Clark can only look up at
	Trask.  Speaking seems to be too much effort.  Trask turns
	away, then suddenly spins and kicks Clark, sending him
	sprawling across the dirt.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		You think you're better than we
		humans, don't you?  Flying around,
		oh-so-perfect and superior.  But
		those days are over, aren't they?

				CLARK
		You're... wrong.

	Trask holds the green rock close to Clark as a weapon.

				TRASK
		No. You're wrong.  It's over, and
		I have won.  This little piece of
		home is going to be the death of
		you, Superman.

	In the far distance, there is the faint sound of SIRENS.
	Trask sets the green rock at Clark's side.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		Unfortunately, I won't be able to
		stay for the services.

	Trask moves off toward the waiting van.

46	ANOTHER ANGLE					46

	Shifting our perspective on the van, as seen parked next
	to a small pond on the property.


47	CLARK						47

	Fighting against the pain, Clark forces himself to reach
	out and grab the Green rock.  It has the effect of
	touching fire.  With all his will summoned, Clark throws
	it toward the pond.	*

				CLARK
		No!


48	THE GREEN ROCK					48

	Sails past Trask and hits another rock projecting above
	the water-line.  We see its ENERGY RELEASED as it
	explodes into a million small pieces that sparkle as they
	dissipate into the wind and pond.

				TRASK
		Oh, very brave. And very foolish.

	Trask upholsters his weapon.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		Now, let's see.  Who should go
		first?  You, or the human traitors
		who have sheltered you all these
		years?

	Clark, only human now, picks himself up from the ground at
	great pain, and charges Trask like an enraged bull.  Trask
	is knocked off his feet, but Clark seems spent by the
	effort.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		You're right, Superman. I don't
		need a gun.

	Trask advances on Clark and in a lightning display of
	martial arts, sends him sprawling back to the ground.
	Clark holds onto Trask's boot and pulls him to the ground
	with him.

	What follows now is a display of courage which proves it
	isn't just super-powers that make Clark Kent a Superman,
	but a super-heart.  Clark and Trask battle man-to-man.
	Trask is the superior street fighter, but Clark has the
	most to lose.  They tumble into the pond.

	Finally, Clark is on top of him, could easily bash his
	brain to smithereens on the rock that shattered the
	meteorite.  The SIRENS are louder now, more imminent.  The
	van races off, not waiting for Trask.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		Go ahead.  Kill me.  I would have
		killed you.

	Clark throws Trask back in the water.

				CLARK
	That's not how I work.

	Clark walks out of the water.  Several sheriff's vehicles
	arrive in quick succession.  The first has Rachel and
	Jimmy.  The second contains Deputy Hank driving Lois and
	Sherman.  As they pile out of the cars, Clark staggers
	against a tree, supporting himself, fighting for
	consciousness.  Lois screams:

				LOIS
		Clark!

	It's Trask emerging from the water, producing a miniature
	weapon from his boot, aiming for Clark.

	Rachel tenses.

	Clark winces, preparing for the worst.

	Jimmy brings his camera up into action.

	A SHOT is fired. Trask falls back into the pond.  Rachel	*
	looks at her smoking gun, in awe that she fired it.  Lois
	runs to Clark's side.  They embrace.  They have survived,
	and we:
