The boulevard is empty, eerie silence. No cars, no people. A man
walks down the middle of the street, long trench, dark shades.
Though he does not speak, we hear...
MAN V.O.
There's two kinds of people in this
world when you boil it all down. You
got your talkers and you got your
doers.
We recognize this man as ROCCO. He crosses Copley Square toward the
looming dome of the Trinity Church.
ROCCO V.O.
Most people are just talkers. All they
got is talk. But when all's said and
done, it is the doers who change the
world. And when they do that, they
change us. That's why we never forget
them...So, which one are you? Do you
just talk about it? Or do you stand up
and do something about it? Because
believe you me all the rest of it is
just coffee house bullshit.
FADE TO BLACK...
SUBTEXT:
"Ireland"
From behind we see two men perched atop a boulder. A flock of sheep
encircles them. Their army sacks and shotguns are nearby. They roll
their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light up.
CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (30's) now have long hair with heavy
facial growth. Rugged. Piercing eyes. Looking to the horizon...
MURPHY
Looks like a storm's comin'.
CONNOR
Aye.
MOODY MUSIC: The brothers drive the flock across jewel green hills.
Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off.
POPPA M V.O.
Peace, they say, is the enemy of
memory. So it had been for my boys.
2.
Connor shares some jerky with a sheep dog as the flock surges.
POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
For some time now, their past had felt
like a dream to them...faded and worn.
Murphy touches the faded Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. Connor
sees. The music takes us to a secluded, pioneer-esque ranch.
CLOSE ON: POPPA M's (58yrs) face as he coughs and watches his sons
approach from his rocking chair on the porch.
POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
And then suddenly, as if not a day had
passed...it was back. I could see it
in their eyes.
Very early dawn, shadowy morning light. Connor and Murphy sip
coffees and look out into the rain. Lightening lights up the flock.
Through the open door behind them, Poppa M stokes a warm fire.
Connor touch the Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. The boys look
at each other as the rain suddenly stops and all the "little sounds"
of morning cease. Something's amiss. Thunder. Ominous music as...
From behind, we see a man with a CREW CUT, staring at the dome of
the Trinity.
SLO-MO, CLOSE ON: Crew Cut's boots as he paces toward.
The
threatening music bleeds over to...
Just inside the trees, a pack of wolves stalk the sheep flock...
SLO-MO, CLOSE ON:
A wolf's paws as it paces toward...
We intercut between BOSTON and IRELAND as chaos erupts...
3.
BOSTON:
Crew Cut quickly enters the church.
IRELAND:
The wolves burst from the tree line.
BOSTON: A frantic priest in his 50's weeps and begs as Crew Cut
slams him to his knees with a .9 mm to his head.
IRELAND:
The wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep.
BOSTON:
Muzzle flash, blood splatters on the altar.
IRELAND: BOOM! BOOM! Connor and Murphy blast shotguns at the
wolves. One is hit, the rest retreat. The boys perform mercy
killings on the wolf and one sheep.
Everything calms as Poppa M rushes up with a mag light and stops.
He coughs roughly. Moody choral music begins...
POPPA M V.O.
"And they cried out, How long O'Lord
dost thou not judge and revenge our
blood upon them that dwell on the
earth?"
The boys toss the wolf carcass onto a bonfire.
It rains again.
POPPA M V.O.
And God said, "All will fear the wrath
of the lamb. For the great day of
their reckoning hath come."
Poppa M looks across the blaze to his sons. Connor and Murphy stare
into the fire, bathed in the light of angry flames.
POPPA M
"And they that holdest my name shall
come with the shaking of the earth and
the roiling of the oceans."
Downpour. A rugged old jeep tears through the mud. It stops at the
farmhouse. Poppa M and the boys come out onto the porch. A dark
figure with a fedora and rain slicker exits the jeep and hurries to
the porch. Meet Uncle SIBEAL (62yrs). He wears a priest's collar.
SIBEAL
Something's happened.
4.
Breaking news. REPORTER #1 is live from outside a church.
Squads,
coroner's vans, CSI etc. Police hold back crowds.
REPORTER #1
There is no new information on the
victim found slain this morning inside
Trinity Church. As you can see the
size of the crowd here has increased
substantially over the last couple of
hours. People are demanding answers as
to how a priest could be murdered in a
church. But perhaps more shocking, we
have confirmed that the body was
ritualized with pennies in the eyes.
Many remember this as the grisly
calling card of the prolific vigilante
killers known as the Saints, who went
on a murder spree here in Boston.
NEWS FOOTAGE:
People scream as they run out of a courthouse.
REPORTER #1 V.O.
A rampage that ended six years ago,
when the Saints brazenly walked into
open court...
NEWS FOOTAGE:
A body is wheeled out on a gurney.
REPORTER #1 V.O. (CONT'D)
...and executed Mafia Don, Poppa Joe
Yakavetta before a courtroom of
terrified witnesses, then simply
disappeared without a trace.
Grainy, unclear security footage of three men walking the court
halls, two in heavy black jackets, one in a trench...
REPORTER #1 V.O. (CONT'D)
The now legendary security camera
footage from that harrowing day, our
singular tiny glimpse of these infamous
and controversial killers.
We are back with Reporter #1 at the church.
REPORTER #1
As police have yet to confirm the
Saints' possible involvement, the
ominous question hangs heavy in the
air. "Are they back?"
5.
Greenly, disguised as a correctional officer, lets Connor, Murphy
and Poppa M out of a paddywagon. FLASH!
The Saints enter the Suffolk Courthouse, undetected.
FLASH!
Dolly, dressed as a civilian, pulls the fire alarm.
FLASH!
The Saints execute Poppa Joe Yakavetta before many terrified
witnesses, the alarm blaring in the b.g. FLASH!
CLOSE ON:
a gravestone.
"Paul M. Smecker,
1956 - 2003"
We reveal a pair of sexy female legs, expensive "Jimmy Choo" heels.
From behind we see the woman rest a rose at Smecker's Grave. "Legs"
turns and walks toward a waiting squad car in b.g.
Dolly, Duffy and Greenly stand outside in the entry way of the
church. Though still on edge, they have calmed.
DOLLY
I didn't even know he had a protege.
What is this bullshit?
Duffy whips out his trusty note pad.
DUFFY
Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years
old. Smecker plucked her right out of
class at Quantico.
GREENLY
Smecker hand picked her? Aw, man.
This brawd's gonna be a nightmare.
DUFFY
She was assigned to OCD two years back.
She can shoot a gun, set three course
records during her training.
GREENLY
Great. A bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna-
be. We gotta get rid of her.
DUFFY
She is also an authority on the Saints
case. Which means Smecker must have
walked her through it.
The cops suddenly flush with fear.
DOLLY
And the hits just keep on comin'.
A squad pulls up.
Dolly, Duffy and Greenly turn.
DOLLY
Game time.
How are we playing this?
DUFFY
Feds love to pull the divide and
conquer routine. We hard line her.
Stick together on this. Agreed?
DOLLY
Agreed.
We're a brick wall.
They all nod and stiffen their resolve.
GREENLY
Let's rock this bitch.
Rockin' music fades in as a uniform opens the squad door.
SLO-MO:
EUNICE BLOOM (32yrs) exits the squad and moves toward.
She is simply delicious: sexy, blonde hair, a woman's business
suit, short skirt, brass rimmed specs. Each detective's face drops.
Soon she is before them. Music cuts. She smiles and speaks with a
southern drawl a la Doc Holiday.
EUNICE
(POINTING)
You hafta be Detectives Dolly and
Duffy. Am I right?
(extending hand)
Eunice Bloom. A pleasure.
Dolly and Duffy shake and manage a nod.
Greenly is still enamored.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
And you must be Greenly. Smecker
always said you were the funny one.
GREENLY
T'sup...I mean, what? Yeah, well,
funny as in ha ha, though not like
funny as in gay cuz...I'm not...played
high school football.
She chuckles.
Dolly and Duffy fume.
10.
DOLLY
Look, with all due respect, Agent
Bloom...
EUNICE
Special.
DOLLY
Excuse me?
EUNICE
You see there's a "special" before my
"agent." If we are going to address
each other formally, I'd prefer if you
popped it in there. Makes me feel, I
don't know...special. Of course, I'd
hoped we could be a little more
personable. In fact, I'd like you to
call me Eunice.
The cops are dumbfounded.
Duffy snaps out of it.
DUFFY
O'kay, Eunice. I don't see why the
fuck the Fed is...
EUNICE
Whoa, whoa, "fuck?" This isn't a
"fuck" situation, is it? I can see a
"God Damn" or two but why skip all the
way to "fuck" right off the bat? Let's
start slow and work our way up to it.
DUFFY
What is the Fed's interest in this?
The detectives harden, brick wall.
Eunice furrows her brow.
EUNICE
Their interest, Detective, is capturing
the men responsible for the murders of
22 of Boston's finest criminals. Y'see
public perception is that these boys
stepped in, did our jobs for us and
then disappeared into thin air as we
fecklessly searched for them. The FBI
tends to take exception to such things.
They coulda sent anyone. They sent me.
Why do you think that is?
(BEAT)
Well, since we've broken the "Fuck
Barrier," allow me to be blunt.
(MORE)
11.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
It is because I am so fucking smart
that I make smart people feel like
retards. Now, we seem to be getting
off on the wrong foot here. I'd
appreciate a bit of cooperation. Let's
chalk it up to paying respect to the
memory of a dearly departed mutual
friend. A man who taught me everything
I know.
After a moment of consideration, the cops concede with nods.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Lovely.
(re: crowd)
Now what's with the circus?
DUFFY
The victim was killed late last night.
When people gathered for morning mass,
they found the front entrance chained
and padlocked. A locksmith came out,
cut the chain and surprise, surprise.
Cell phones. Half of them called the
cops. Half of them called the media.
But regardless...word's out.
Eunice turns and looks over the crowd.
EUNICE
And it looks like that's just the way
somebody wanted it. What say we scrape
the shit off this cow's ass, fellas?
Detective Greenly? Escort a lady onto
the crime scene?
GREENLY
What?
No, yeah, no.
Of course.
Greenly escorts her as Dolly and Duffy walk behind, mystified.
GREENLY (CONT'D)
Do you want a cup of coffee or
something?
EUNICE
Never touch the stuff.
We drift over open sea to a huge cargo freighter, the Killian
Farris, plodding toward Northeast.
16.
HOT DOG VENDOR
These guys have gone "mad dog" here.
They need to be put down.
CAB DRIVER
I think it's disgusting.
I wish they'd
have stayed gone.
PEDESTRIAN
I don't believe it for a second!
No
bleep-in way the Saints did it!
CLOSE ON: Connor, Murphy and Romeo peaking over a concrete wall.
Three sets of eyes.
Our trio is atop a dumpster, peaking over at the loading dock.
Chinese Gangsters supervise unloading of crates onto a flatbed.
ROMEO
It's been all over the papers the last
two years. Yakavetta's in bed with the
Chinese. They're using international
shipping routes to smuggle it in. This
is Little Yaka's shit.
Connor and Murphy smile.
30.
CONNOR
Let's follow 'em down the rabbit hole,
Alice.
Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder.
MURPHY
You just scored a few points, Rome.
ROMEO
Well, dust off my "Members Only"
jacket.
(pulls set of keys)
Cuz the kid has also supplied the ride!
CLOSE ON:
Three sets of eyes peaking over oil drums.
Our trio watches as a DOCK WORKER (22yrs) drives a forklift,
unloading the crates from the flatbed and driving them through the
huge open bay doors. The boys and Romeo huddle up.
CONNOR
O'kay, here's the plan.
The "Queen" classic, Another One Bites the Dust, presides over this
fantasy sequence. The boys, looking more "quaffed," do a pointless
slow motion walk toward the forklift, throwing up their collars.
Romeo, also looking polished, executes a "Dan Tana" pistol whipping
on the Dock Worker who perfectly out of frame.
INSIDE WAREHOUSE: The lift pulls to a stop before the gangsters,
crate on the forks. Romeo is behind the wheel.
SLO-MO: Connor and Murphy pop from the crate and fire on their
Asian foe, hitting each squarely in the chest.
SLO-MO: The boys leap down and light cigs as Romeo does the "one
arm action star hang" off the side of the lift in b.g. WHIP PAN...
CONNOR
We skin out, go ta Doc's for a shot of
Irish. We're home in time for tacos.
Murphy looks unsure.
Connor turns to his brother.
CONNOR (CONT'D)
What?
MURPHY
Well, it's...uh...you know, it's...
32.
ROMEO
It's genius. I can even drive an F-
lift, man. Got my class "D" license
and everything.
CONNOR
Now, dat's the spirit.
ROMEO
I need a gun.
CONNOR AND MURPHY
Forget it.
ROMEO
What the fuck? I'm in on this shit,
man! I'm working here!
The boys look to each other. Murphy shrugs. Relenting, Connor
pulls a metallic object and shoves it in Romeo's hand.
CONNOR
You can consider yourself a fuckin'
pledge until we say different.
Romeo holds up the gun in displeasure, a tiny .22 caliber lady's
purse pistol. Murphy snickers.
ROMEO
Can I consider myself your girlfriend,
too?
CONNOR
That's what you get.
Is there a
problem?
ROMEO
(beat, fuming)
It's fine.
Connor scopes the warehouse.
Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder.
MURPHY
Don't worry, Rome.
Shit like this
builds character.
ROMEO
Yeah, the character of a little bitch.
MURPHY
Now, dat's just unprofessional.
He turns and joins his brother as Romeo continues sulking.
33.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
What do we think?
CONNOR
I think Yakavetta murdered a good man
just to send us a message.
MURPHY
Well...let's send him one back.
As they spirit themselves off.
DISSOLVE TO...
Eunice walks toward the crime scene with the CHIEF (50's).
CHIEF
Your boss, John Kuntsler called. Tells
me you got a problem with authority.
EUNICE
Absolute horse pucky, Chief.
Unfortunately, authority's developed a
problem with me.
CHIEF
And what's that?
They enter the...
On the flatbed, the brothers shovel coffee out of the final crate
which rests on the forks of the lift. Below them stands the Dock
Worker holding his bleeding head. Romeo covers him with his 22.
DOCK WORKER
You didn't have to bash me in the
skull.
ROMEO
Sorry, man. We got a plan going, here.
Technically, I was supposed to knock
you out.
DOCK WORKER
Christ! You got a gun. You could have
just pointed it at me and said SCRAM!
Connor points his gun at the Dock Worker.
CONNOR
SCRAM!
DOCK WORKER
You got it!
He runs off.
Romeo turns up to them.
ROMEO
So, let's not let this one, small
incident get in the way of...
CONNOR
Shut up and get behind the fuckin'
wheel!
Romeo hops into the driver's seat.
MURPHY
Well, at least the plan is off to a
winning start.
CONNOR
Go fuck y'rself.
36.
They pull wrapped white kilos.
Connor dips in a finger and tastes.
CONNOR (CONT'D)
It's heroin.
MURPHY
How the fuck would you know?
CONNOR
Fuck you.
I know shit.
Bodies are wheeled out in the b.g. as Dolly and Greenly talk
privately with Eunice.
DOLLY
Just got a call from my best snitch.
Never steered me wrong. He says its
this guy.
(hands Eunice mug)
"Gorgeous" George Tuffano. He's
trusted bruglione to Yakavetta but not
blood. He's been left control of the
streets. He's running all of it.
Eunice looks over the mug shot.
GREENLY
They call him "Gorgeous" cuz he likes
his silk suits and jewelry. He's even
got the 'out of season' fake bake going
on, a real peacock, this guy.
EUNICE
Yeah, I heard of this rodeo clown.
Duffy approaches, hands Eunice a tiny bullet in a baggy.
DUFFY
Ballistics just dug it out.
They all look perplexed.
EUNICE
A twenty two? You gotta be kidding me.
That's like bringing a knife to a
gunfight.
GREENLY
Yeah, or like bringing a really small
gun...to a gunfight.
They all blank stare Greenly for a moment.
Moving on.
39.
DUFFY
I don't know. Ballistics is reading
three shooters. This is one of them.
EUNICE
Well, I'm having a hard time believing
that one of the three most lethal
individuals on the planet just switched
over to bird shot.
DOLLY
Maybe we're reading it wrong. The
priest was a frame job, right?
DUFFY
Yeah, maybe somebody's trying to
eliminate some competition here.
Eunice considers this.
The Detectives seem hopeful.
EUNICE
No, sir. It's them. But we just might
have ourselves a change in the line up,
here.
The detectives all look at one another nervously.
GREENLY
Fine, they're back.
What's the plan?
EUNICE
Hell, we've just been called up to the
big show. We are tracking multiple
perpetrators, gentlemen. The plan? We
keep our ear to the ground and try to
figure out where Yakavetta's hiding.
Napoleon. We find him and flip him.
And as for the Saints...I'm gonna have
me a face to face with these boys one
way or the other.
She walks off.
The cops look terrified.
DOLLY
Holy...fucking...shit.
The Saints pencil composites are shown.
From the studio...
REPORTER #1 V.O.
It's confirmed. The five drug
traffickers all involved in the heroin
trade were victims of the Saints.
STATIC!
CHANEL CHANGES!
Bodies are wheeled out...
REPORTER #2 V.O.
...several having close ties to the
Yakavetta Crime Family, confirming the
long suspected merger of the Chinese
Triad and the Mafia.
CLOSE ON:
A metal door opens revealing DOC (60's).
DOC
BOYS!
The brothers and Doc hug and greet as he ushers them in with Romeo
in tow. The bar is closed, empty.
DOC (CONT'D)
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! I saw da nuh,
nuh, news channel. Are ya boys all
right?!
CONNOR
Sound as an Irish pound, Doc.
MURPHY
Is it too late for a shot?
DOC
Oh, the Lord told me you'd be comin!
He said, "Doc, they're comin" and I was
ta get everting ready. So I did.
Everting's ruh, ruh, ruh, it's all set.
41.
ROMEO
Uh, hem!
MURPHY
Oh, this is our Mexican.
DOC
(shaking hands)
How are ya, lad? They call
me...FUCK!...ASS!
ROMEO
Nice to meet you, Fuck Ass, I'm Romeo.
Eunice enters the swanky salon and moves across the lobby.
A Mexican joint, tucked away down by the docks.
ROMEO V.O.
You wanna find something in Boston that
don't wanna be found you go to the
Oracle, ese. My Uncle Cesar is hooked
up with the Underground.
We are out back, among scrap cars. George talks with JO JO RHAMA
(38yrs). Jo Jo is built like a fire plug and clearly a hoodlum.
49.
JO JO
A priest.
The sick fuck.
GEORGE
And he leaves all of us on the streets
holding the bag while him and his are
living it up at the Taj fuckin' Majal,
not a care in the world.
JO JO
So, until the Saints get popped, we're
all lambs to slaughter?
GEORGE
Yeah! And he don't care how many of us
they wipe out in the meantime!
JO JO
What do you need me to do, Skipper?
GEORGE
Spread the word to all the brugliones.
No bullshit. From your mouth to their
ears.
JO JO
Everyone? North and South?
That could
get a little dicey.
GEORGE
Fuck their old grudges. All of them
are in this, like it or not. Tell them
everything we discussed.
JO JO
Even the panic room thing?
GEORGE
Sure.
JO JO
Good. That's a nice ice breaker.
They'll get a kick outta that. I
didn't even know those things were
real. I thought they made that shit up
for that movie? With that brawd and
that kid? With those guys in that
house?
GEORGE
Panic Room?
50.
JO JO
Naw, the other one.
GEORGE
Stop fuckin' around! This is serious
shit, here! Tell 'em we meet tomorrow
night. I'll call you with the
location.
POV of binoculars as we see George exit the front of the auto body.
Moody music as our trio walks through the gravestones.
Jo Jo exits his Cadillac and walks toward El Cava.
There is a
"closed for private function" sign on the door.
Press clamors for the story in the b.g. Eunice and the detectives
are in a private spot. Greenly excitedly hands her the file.
GREENLY
INTERpol came through.
Eunice opens the file.
Picture of Crew Cut.
Dolly and Duffy read
over her shoulder.
GREENLY (CONT'D)
You were right. Five foot five.
Gotta
be the shooter.
Eunice smiles and speaks to Crew Cut's photo...
EUNICE
Are you ready for your fifteen minutes,
Sweetheart?
GREENLY
That ain't all. Short stuff's work
visa was signed by a sponsor that
doesn't exist and look at the date.
Two months after Nine Eleven.
EUNICE
Someone maneuvered it through the
system using false information during
the highest alert in U.S. history.
DOLLY
Yakavetta's just a gangster. He ain't
got the juice to pull that off.
EUNICE
You're darn tootin' he don't.
GREENLY
INS red flagged it like a motherfucker.
It's a shit storm.
EUNICE
Something stanks like manure.
The cops nod.
Eunice turns and starts to move away...
67.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
We got someplace to be! Let's go!
Eunice pulls to a stop. At the sight of the place, the cops turn
white as a ghost. All exit the vehicle and walk toward.
GREENLY
It's after hours. I mean, if you
wanted a drink then...
EUNICE
37 bodies later and we're finally back
where it all began. Y'ever heard of
the southern expression, "We have an
elephant in the living room?"
She knocks on the door.
The cops are mortified.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Hope you fellas brought some peanuts.
Doc opens it and lets them all into...
This is a common home at the end of a cul de sac. The Old Man picks
up the paper on his front stoop and shuts the door.
He opens the paper with shock. A big picture of Crew Cut on the
front, "SAINTS INNOCENT, NEW SUSPECT IN PRIEST'S MURDER" He reads
frantically. "New evidence discovered at the crime scene..."
73.
OLD MAN
Evidence?
He ambles into the house and to a...
Dolly drives a laundry truck into the Pru's loading dock area.
Eunice walks the roof with Kuntsler et al in tow.
EUNICE
Let's explain the glass, now.
Why is
most of it inside the room?
They halt before a window washing scaffold.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Here's why...or it will be "why" in a
moment. Y'see, these boys. Well, to
put it simply, they tend to get
reeeeal...
FLASH TO WHITE...
CONNOR
Creative!
It's a creative plan!
Duffy, Greenly and the boys descend the tower. Greenly works the
controls as Duffy helps the boys tie on harnesses.
MURPHY
It's ridiculous! Probably based on
some stupid shit ya saw in a movie!
And here I am AGAIN all tyin' myself up
with rope! What is the deal with you
and rope?! Honestly!
CONNOR
It happens ta be a useful thing!
The boys start yelling over each other.
Duffy turns to Connor.
DUFFY
You didn't get this from a movie...did
you?
Murphy regards his brother, "well?"
Pause.
81.
CONNOR
The "Eiger Sanction," Clint Eastwood!
And it worked like a fucking charm for
him!
Eunice stands alone on the end of the scaffold.
82.
EUNICE
And you can count on it like the U.S.
mail. Through rain, sleet, hail or
snow...something always seems to go
wrong for these poor sons o' guns.
The scaffold suddenly stops.
CONNOR
What the fuck?
GREENLY
(hitting controls)
I don't know! It just stopped!
MURPHY
Well, get it fuckin' goin' again!
GREENLY
It won't turn back on!
It just died!
BROTHERS
OH, SHIT!
The boys look over the edge.
Long way down.
CONNOR
How much time?!
DUFFY
(looks at watch)
Sixty Seconds!
MURPHY
We gotta go now!
DUFFY
What are you talking about!?
CONNOR
If we're even a few seconds late,
Romeo's dead! We gotta go!
(looking up)
We're down thirteen stories!
MURPHY
Eleven more to go!
Ball park it!
They start counting out lengths of rope by feeding them through
their hands and extending their arms out to the sides.
BROTHERS
One floor, two, three...
83.
MURPHY
(MIFFED)
The fuckin' Eiger Sanction.
The boys' ropes are secured and they each pull a Rambo knife.
MURPHY
TIME?!
DUFFY
JESUS CHRIST! SEVEN SECONDS...SIX...
FIVE...
First, Connor jumps off, then Murphy.
They fall down and out in
slow motion, knives in hand.
Panic room door opens and Eunice emerges with Jimmy in tow.
89.
GREENLY
(re: Jimmy)
Did this little motherfucker...?
EUNICE
Easy, David. I'm fine. C'mon gents,
we're leaving. This is the Fed's
problem, now.
KUNTSLER
Hey! What happened in there?
What was
said to you, Agent?
Jimmy is cuffed by two uniforms.
EUNICE
You got him in custody. Ask him
yourself. You're the professional.
She walks out and the detectives follow.
DOLLY
Yeah, professional moron.
There are coroner vans and moderate police activity here as Eunice
talks with the detectives who all seem perplexed.
DUFFY
I got no idea. That's just weird. The
Roman? What do you think it means?
EUNICE
Feels like our ghost ta me.
DOLLY
What do we do now? I mean, the
brothers ain't goin' nowhere until we
get Panza or they do.
EUNICE
We've all had enough excitement for one
night. Let's sleep on it.
Crew Cut watches Eunice and the detectives from the dark alley.
He
has shaved his head bald, giving him a sinister look.
90.
Noah, Louie and a priest are the only ones present at this modest
affair. Louie weeps. Noah is emotionless.
POPPA M V.O.
I buried my father, then I buried the
men who killed him. Louie, my best
friend, helped me...
Noah and Louie bury the bodies of Mafioso #1 and #2.
Louie stops
and rests. He watches Noah and thinks.
We pan to the gaping mouthed brothers.
MURPHY
Jesus.
CONNOR
So...how'd ya end up inside, Da?
POPPA M
Back in '75, I did a hit, came out and
the police were waitin' for me. He set
me up, 25 to life.
MURPHY
Wait...why did he set you up?
POPPA M
Can't wait ta ask him.
CONNOR
Why didn't ya flip on him? Cut down
yer time? The guy fucked ya.
POPPA M
I couldn't.
CONNOR
Why the hell not?
98.
POPPA M
He'd learned of the birth of my sons.
Connor and Murphy hang their heads.
Connor looks up.
CONNOR
Do you know Louie's full name?
POPPA M
Aye.
The boys look at each other.
Greenly's bagged body is about to be loaded into an ambulance.
Eunice stops the EMTs, unzips it and touches his face. She weeps
and then crushes into Dolly's chest.
He holds her and cries too as Duffy watches in anguish. Eunice's
cell rings. She ignores it and Dolly pulls it from her pocket and
tosses it to Duffy, never letting go of Eunice.
DUFFY
Hello.
Alternating coverage.
CONNOR
It's me.
Put Eunice on.
Connor hands the phone to Poppa M.
DISSOLVE TO...
The boys stand on the mound.
Rocco walks a circle around it.
ROCCO
So, how's things going?
The boys drop their heads.
ROCCO (CONT'D)
Yeah. I know. It's rough having your
faith shaken.
The brothers have a pained expression.
ROCCO (CONT'D)
But it happens to all of us.
(BEAT)
You know what's always tripped me out?
How hundreds of years ago, a bunch of
desperate gamblers in leaky ass ships,
crossed the ocean blue. They had no
clue what was on the other side of it.
Took real balls. But they sailed into
infinity and made it all the way to the
shores of the New fucking World...
(re: surroundings)
...and all they had was their faith.
I'm always surprised how so many people
miss the simple fact that faith...is
the reason all of us are even here.
You can't underestimate the power of
it. Shit, you were the ones that
taught me that.
Rocco looks to his left and right.
Secretly.
ROCCO (CONT'D)
Listen, your my boys so I'm gonna give
you some inside. The Sox are gonna do
it again this year. The line in Vegas
is huge. Put everything you got on it.
The boys look to each other.
Eyes wide.
101.
MURPHY
Maybe we should.
CONNOR
You're sure, Roc? You know this?
Rocco smiles.
ROCCO
No...I
just have faith. And for a
second
there, you almost did too.
Y'see,
it's contagious. And if enough
people
catch it...look out, baby.
A roaring cheer arises, shaking the very foundations of the arena.
The boys turn in awe. The stands are still empty.
Poppa M stands before Eunice.
She hands him an envelope.
EUNICE
He lives in York Maine. About 30
minutes from here. Better go quick. I
logged on to an FBI database to get the
info. Homeland Security does internal
monitoring now. Only a matter of time
before they flag it.
POPPA M
Will they know it's you?
(she nods)
Will you be all right, dear?
EUNICE
I hear Costa Rica's nice.
She looks at him as her eyes well up with tears.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
I never thought I'd ask this of another
human being but please...kill this man.
102.
She is overcome and weeps.
Poppa M holds her.
POPPA M
It ends taday.
Outside, back wall of greenhouse.
THUGs 1-5 from Patronazzi, hunker
down here. They are all armed.
THUG #1
(whispered into walkie)
Remember, not a scratch on the Old Man.
S.W.A.T. teams load into vans.
Squad cars speed through traffic.
Squad cars screech to a halt as the chopper lands behind them.
Kuntsler exits, shouting orders. Many officers level over their
hoods as S.W.A.T. piles out and moves toward.
Cops level over their squads.
Media descends.
POPPA M V.O.
...for Thee, my Lord, for Thee...
The door opens and the boys walk out, guns down.
POPPA M V.O.
So, we shall flow a river forth to
Thee...
SLO-MO: The boys stop in the middle of the lawn and look out over
the massive presence. A policeman yells in his bullhorn, m.o.s.
SLO-MO, CLOSE ON:
The brothers' guns fall to the grass.
POPPA M V.O.
In Nomini Patri...
SLO-MO:
The brothers drop to their knees.
CONNOR

SLO-MO:
The brothers put their hands behind their heads.
MURPHY
