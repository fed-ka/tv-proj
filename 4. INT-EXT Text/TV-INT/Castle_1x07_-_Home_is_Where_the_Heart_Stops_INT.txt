...a well-appointed living room. It looks like it s snowing.

More and more tufts of white waft down through the air. The 
indoor  snow  flurry OBSCURES OUR VISION as we continue our 
PAN across the tasteful, traditional oak and cherry 
furniture, Queen Anne chairs, to a burbling fireplace.  

PRE-LAP - someone tickling the ivories. Haunting piano music.

We FOLLOW our feather as it descends gently, landing in a 
pool of BLOOD. It floats, suspended, spinning on the viscous 
surface of the still pool.

Drops of blood lead us up the wall to an open WALL SAFE. With 
sudden violence, a hand flops out of the safe and pendulums 
in front of us. The third finger of a WOMAN S left hand 
having been taken off at the knuckle.

THE BASS CHORDS of the piano accentuates the horror and then 
our score begins to quicken, rising in intensity. The sound 
of CLASHING SWORDS takes us to...


MARTHA s fingers fly across piano keys. The music is rousing, 
like the improvised score of a silent adventure film.

An elongated SHADOW PLAY on the wall behind her: two 
swordsmen in combat, blades clashing as their shadows move 
across the wall - one advancing and the other retreating, and 
then the reverse. 

CASTLE (O.S.)
 You ve come to Nottingham once too 
often. 

ALEXIS (O.S.)
 When this is over, they ll be no 
need for me to come again. 

And now the actual fencers move into frame - CASTLE and 
ALEXIS - both expertly wielding epees. These matches are 
their own eccentric version of a father/daughter game of 
catch. Martha provides the accompaniment. Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 2.


CASTLE
So...who is he?

ALEXIS
His name s Owen. He s in my poetry 
class. Very shy. And very sweet.

Castle lunges, the point of his blade landing on her chest. 
He pulls up his mask. 

CASTLE
Keep your guard up.

She raises her mask as well and smacks his blade.

ALEXIS
Then don t distract me.

CASTLE
Does he know how you feel about 
him?

ALEXIS
No.

She lowers her mask, and stands en garde. He lowers his mask 
as well.

CASTLE
Why not?

They resume fencing.

ALEXIS
Because I don t even know how I 
feel about him.

She lunges, disengages his parry, and lands with her tip.

CASTLE
Yes! Nice!

On the counter, Castle s phone brays BECKETT S RINGTONE. They 
pause, salute, and Alexis deftly uses the tip of her epee to 
sweep the phone across the counter to Castle - air hockey 
style. Castle catches it, flips it open.

CASTLE (CONT D)
(muffled by his mask)
Hello? Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 3.



Down the hall, ESPOSITO is taking a statement from a crying 
WOMAN. This is JOANNE DELGADO, early 30s, and the victim s 
daughter. Castle and BECKETT step off the elevator to meet 
RYAN. Ryan s red-faced, sniffling, his eyes watery. He rubs 
his nose...

RYAN
No sign of forced entry. Same as 
the others. 

BECKETT
Looks like our home invasion crew 
just went for a four-peat. 

RYAN
They re stepping up their game. 
Becoming more violent.

Ryan sneezes.

CASTLE/BECKETT
Bless you. 

CASTLE
Jinx!

Esposito joins them.

BECKETT
(re: Ryan)
What s with him?

ESPOSITO
(grinning)
Goose down. He s allergic.

CASTLE
(to Beckett)
Whoa whoa whoa. Under the time 
honored rules of personal jinx you 
aren t allowed to talk until I 
release you.

Ryan sneezes violently, again.

CASTLE/BECKETT/ESPOSITO
Bless you!Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 4.


Beckett turns to Castle, serious.

BECKETT
Reverse double jinx.

Castle, caught off-guard, starts to talk.

BECKETT (CONT D)
Uh uh. Mouth shut, Castle, until I 
release you. Thanks Ryan.

Ryan nods, leaving Castle flummoxed. Beckett and Esposito 
walk and talk. Esposito nods to Joanne.

ESPOSITO
Joanne Delgado, daughter of Susan 
Delgado, the victim. She calls to 
say good night like always, only 
tonight Mom doesn t pick up. Joanne 
calls the doorman, he comes up, 
finds the door ajar, and- 

They approach Susan s apartment. Two uniforms guard the door.

BECKETT
And?

ESPOSITO
Let s just say this one s 
definitely Beckett-flavored.


Various angles as CAMERA FLASHES strobe the room, revealing 
every surface of Susan s lovely apartment salted with white 
feathers. LANIE and a CSU PHOTOG are at the open WALL SAFE. 
SUSAN DELGADO S body has been stuffed inside. 

Castle contorts himself unconsciously, seeing how it would 
have been possible.

Gloving up, Beckett approaches the safe. Castle, Ryan, and 
Esposito flow in behind her, but hang back.

LANIE
There s spatter over the fireplace. 
(hooking her thumb at it)
Indicates a single GSW. Close 
range.

Lanie tweezes a blood-soaked feather out of the pool.

BECKETT
You can still smell the cordite.Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 5.


RYAN
I ll have to take your word for it.

ESPOSITO
Better than last time.
(off Castle s look)
They beat the guy to death.

BECKETT
None of her neighbors heard the 
shot?

ESPOSITO
Nada. Must be heavy sleepers.

Castle squats over an exploded pillowcase. 

CASTLE
The pillow acted as a poor man s 
sound suppressor.
(off Beckett s look)
Fine. I broke the jinx. I ll buy 
you a soda.

Ryan squats next to Castle and uses his pen to sift through 
the folds of the pillowcase for the singed hole. 

BECKETT
(scanning the floor)
No shell casing?

LANIE
None.

BECKETT
Probably used a revolver. 

Beckett focuses on the missing finger.

LANIE
(cold)
And a bolt cutter.

BECKETT
Her wedding ring. She wouldn t give 
it up and they punished her for it. 
Husband? 

ESPOSITO
Passed a few years ago. 

Castle surveys the apartment...Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 6.


CASTLE
This building. This part of town. 
You d think she was safe...

How often do people get killed in 
neighborhoods like this?

BECKETT
Same as anywhere, Castle. Just the 
once.

CASTLE TITLE CARD


CLOSE ON a push pin being shoved into a map. It bears the 
number FOUR. PULLING BACK we find...

Beckett is in front of a bulletin board displaying CRIME 
SCENE PHOTOS and NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS from the four home 
invasions. There are four PINS on the MAP. 

CASTLE
Each one of the robberies was in a 
different part of the city.

BECKETT
A different high-end part of the 
city.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Wall safes and high-end 
jewelry. They came in knowing 
exactly what they were going to 
find.

CASTLE
There s got to be a pattern. 
Something that connects them all.
First one was three months ago?

RYAN
Central Park West. Bob and Linda 
Kesler were bound, gagged, and 
beaten. The intruders were masked. 
Took roughly $175,000 in jewelry.

Castle moves to PIN NUMBER TWO.  

CASTLE
Same M.O. on Yorke Street?Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 7.


ESPOSITO
Yeah. Only when Mr. Bruner refused 
to open his safe, they broke his 
wife s arms and made him watch. 
Walked out with $196,000 in bearer 
bonds.

CASTLE
That was six weeks after their 
first job. And they hit the third 
apartment on 59th Street less than 
three weeks later.

BECKETT
And by then it wasn t just broken  
arms anymore.

She nods to homicide scene PHOTOS of a DEAD MAN in his 50s, 
bound and bleeding from a head trauma.

RYAN
Richard and Julie Pastori. Richard 
opened the safe but warned the guys 
to keep their hands off his wife.

BECKETT
They beat him to death for his 
gallantry. 

CASTLE
Which brings us to tonight.

BECKETT
They re getting bolder, escalating 
their violence.

CASTLE
Not just their violence. Also their 
timetable. 

ESPOSITO
He s right. Tonight s was less than 
a week after the last one.

Castle stares at the board.

CASTLE
This can t be random. I mean, how 
did they know what was in the 
safes?
(he pauses)
Is that a word,  Safes ? Or is it 
 saves ? No, it can t be saves...Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 8.


ESPOSITO
And you write for a living?

BECKETT
Castle. The point? 

CASTLE
The point is, our home invaders 
seem to know an awful lot about 
their victims.

RYAN
We ve compared insurance companies, 
home security vendors, even the 
kinds of safes they had. Nothing s 
been a match.

CASTLE
Right. But I was thinking if they 
know so much about their targets, 
maybe they actually know them.

Off Beckett,

CUT TO:


Joanne Delgado cradles some hot tea, across from Beckett and 
Castle.

JOANNE
Close? We were very close. She was 
my mother.

BECKETT
So you d know most of her friends.

JOANNE
Her friends? Yes, but...

BECKETT
Were there any you had a strong

No.

BECKETT
Did you know Nelson and Janet 
Bruner?

JOANNE
No.

How about Richard and Julie Pastori 
or Bob and Linda Kesler?

JOANNE
Who are these people?

A moment.

BECKETT
They re victims in three previous 
home invasion robberies - robberies 
we think were committed by the same 
people who murdered your mother.

JOANNE
Others? There were others? How long 
has this been going on? 

BECKETT
A few months.

Joanne hardens.

JOANNE
Months? And you haven t caught 
them?

They hadn t murdered anyone until

after airline crashes and E. coli 
poisonings.

Beckett s been through the anger. Castle studies Beckett as 
she lets Joanne get some of the poison out of the wound. 

JOANNE (CONT D)
Our hearts? What does that even 
mean? She said she felt like 
baking. She wanted me to come by, 
but I was busy. I was busy and now 
she s dead.
(breaking down)
...I should have been there - 

Joanne s losing it now. And Castle watches, a fascinated 
interloper, as Beckett brings Joanne back. 

BECKETT
-Joanne. Joanne. Listen to me.
(holding her eyes)
You re going to want to play out 
every possible scenario in the next 
few days. If only you d been there. 
If only you d come over. If only 
you hadn t worked late.
(off Joanne)
Believe me. I ve been there. And 
I m telling you it s not your 
fault. The only ones to blame are 
the monsters who murdered your 
mother. 

Beckett pulls back, hearing the emotion leaking out in her 
own voice. 

BECKETT (CONT D)
This isn t a speech. This isn t a 
platitude. It s a promise. I will 
do everything in my power to see 
that these people pay for what 
they ve done.

Castle puts money into a vending machine as Beckett looks at 
her options. 

CASTLE
Pretty impressive, the way you 
handled her back there.

BECKETT
I didn t  handle  her, Castle. I 
told her the truth. The same thing 
I m about to do with the other home 
invasion victims.

She punches a button on the machine. Castle recovers the soda 
and hands it to her. 

CASTLE
Jinx paid in full. 

BECKETT
Grief is grief. It just wears a lot 
of different faces. And there s no 
comfort for any of them. 

CASTLE
You re short-selling, Beckett. Ryan 
and Esposito couldn t have managed 
that level of empathy.

BECKETT
That s not true. It s just they 
save it for fantasy football 
trades.

Beckett shoots him a smile. Castle knows that s her way of 
taking the compliment.

CASTLE
Makes me think about Alexis. What 
she would do if anything happened 
to me -

BECKETT
She d still have her mother, right? 

They walk and talk down the hallway.

of us, I was the more responsible 
one, if you can believe it.Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 12.

ACT TWO


Ryan and Esposito at Esposito s desk. MONTGOMERY arrives.

MONTGOMERY
Anything from the other victims?

ESPOSITO
Beckett s downtown finishing the 
canvass, but here s what we know. 
The Keslers and the Pastoris didn t 
know each other, and neither of 
them knew the Bruners or Susan 
Delgado.

MONTGOMERY
So much for the personal angle. 

RYAN
Four luxury buildings, four major 
scores and we got nothing. If I m 
these guys, I got no incentive to 
quit now either. 

ESPOSITO
Yeah, well, whoever they are, they 
definitely have some righteous 
trade craft.

Montgomery hands them a CSU report.

MONTGOMERY
About that... Forensics just came 
back on the Delgado s place. They 
found brass shavings in the lock 
mechanism on the front door.

RYAN
Brass shavings?

ESPOSITO

They used a bump key... Bad guy 
files down a standard house key, 
then uses a mallet to drive it into 
the lock. It separates the tumblers 
like billiard balls.Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 14.


RYAN
Dude, I know what a bump key is. But 
the hardware on the Delgado s door 
was a high-end import. A standard 
bump key wouldn t work.

ESPOSITO
(considering that)
No. You d need something special. 
Something your average mope 
couldn t rig.

Esposito takes a seat at his computer. Starts bringing 
something up on his screen.

MONTGOMERY
What are you thinking?

ESPOSITO
There s a guy I busted a while 
back. Specialized in bump keys.  
And definitely not afraid to get a 
little blood on his paws either. 

MONTGOMERY
Bump keys and violence. I like him 
already.

Ryan join him.

MONTGOMERY
He s a legacy. Dad and grandpa were

Castle enters into an elegant, cozy little GARRET. Leather

There is a state of the art workbench filled with HIGH END *

Castle opens a leather-bound ALBUM on the workbench, flipping *
through yellowed NEWS CLIPPINGS of big JEWELRY HEISTS from *
around the world. 

Castle notices the more recent (still white) Ledger clippings *
from the latest string of HOME INVASIONS posted on a pillar. *
A chill runs through him. Maybe this was a very bad idea.

I ve been waiting a long time for 
this, Castle.

CAINE POWELL, 60s, emerges from the shadows behind Castle. 
Think James Bond meets John Robie. Gray but still dangerous.

BAM. A punch sends Castle sprawling.

ACT THREE


Castle sits in a leather wingback, rubbing his jaw. Powell 
chuckles, sets down a cheese tray, and pours wine for them. *

POWELL
What can I say, Rick. You had it 
coming.

CASTLE
Yes I did. Thanks for not killing 
me.

POWELL
The carpet s antique. Turkish, mid 
1600s. Blood stains would ve been 
disastrous. Besides, I was ready to 
retire. Being a ghost is a young 
man s game.

CASTLE
It s good to see you again, old 
friend.

POWELL
And you as well, dear boy. Tell me, 
how is my dear Martha?

CASTLE
Still a one-woman-show in search of 
an audience. She says you owe her a 
night at Le Cirque.

POWELL
And a bottle of Petrus, I dare say.

Powell raises his glass.  

POWELL (CONT D)
To your good health.

Castle raises his glass too.

CASTLE
To Turkish carpets.

POWELL
And to what do I owe the pleasure?

Powell examines their luster and curves as if he were 
admiring a beautiful woman.

POWELL (CONT D)
So very lovely.  

CASTLE
I was wondering if anyone s tried 
to fence them?

POWELL
I ve heard nary a whisper of 
anything in this range. But then 
every highwayman in town knows I 
refuse to touch anything with blood 
on it.

CASTLE
Is there anything special about 
them. Anything they have in common? 

POWELL
You mean you don t see it. 
(Castle doesn t)
These are not for everyday wear. 
No. I would think one dusts them 
off only for special occasions.

CASTLE
So, how did our thieves know they 
were there?

POWELL
Seeing precedes wanting, Rick. 
These chaps may in fact move among 
their victims, drift through their 
worlds. 

CASTLE
And I guess everyone wants to hunt 
above his station. 

POWELL
That s half the delight...
(a delicious memory)
Just walking through those uptown 
homes, living in them for those few 
moments. 

CASTLE
Anything else you can tell me about 
them?Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 28.


POWELL
Without seeing the crime scene, 
anything more would simply be idle 
speculation.

CASTLE
The scene s locked and sealed. I 
don t think I could get you in.

Powell throws him an amused glance.

POWELL
That should be the least of our 
concerns.

Off Powell s widening Cheshire grin. 


Dark. Empty. The lock pops delicately, revealing Powell and 
Castle holding flashlights. Powell replaces his picks and 
tucks the case into the pocket of his leather jacket.

CASTLE
You, uh, don t seem out of 
practice.

POWELL
Like riding a bike.

CASTLE
The thieves used a bump key.

POWELL
How utterly vulgar.
(tut-tut)
This new generation.

They move through the darkness, flashlights illuminating 
familiar settings. Feathers, etc.

CASTLE
So you think we re looking for a 
younger crew.

POWELL
Younger than me, certainly. 

His flashlight falls on the pool of blood. 

POWELL (CONT D)
But this sort of appetite, one 
usually develops on the dark side 
of thirty. Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 29.


His flashlight follows the blood trail up to the safe.

POWELL (CONT D)
You didn t tell me they put her in 
the safe, Rick. 

CASTLE
What s the significance?

POWELL
The significance is that it s 
unnecessary. It s brutality for 
brutality s sake.
(eyeing the stain)
This used to be a gentlemen s game. 
We were ghosts. We could walk 
through walls and simply disappear. 
But the men who did this? They re 
more like vampires. The blood makes 
them feel alive. They don t want  
to disappear. They want people to 
know what they ve done.
(anger rising)
You know, I was going to say these 
aren t the sort of chaps a fellow 
in my line of work wants to meet by 
chance in the dark, but now I think 
I would very much like to meet 
these...gentlemen.

CASTLE
How often does that happen? 

POWELL
More often than you d think. You 
climb in through a window only to 
find another  interested party  
coming through the skylight. 

CASTLE
And then what?

POWELL
In my day, something was usually 
worked out. There was a Code of 
Conduct among true professionals, 
but these men have not only 
violated it, they re also 
advertising it, so others like me

He stops abruptly. Spidey-sense tingling. Castle starts to 
speak, but Powell puts a finger to his lips. Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 30.


We hear a footfall. Someone s coming. Powell douses his 
light, indicates to Castle to do the same. A beat of 
darkness.

CASTLE

Powell? Powell?

And suddenly, the LIGHTS snap on, revealing BECKETT - her gun 
drawn. 

BECKETT
Hands! Show me your hands!

And there s Castle, hands raised. Powell nowhere to be found. 

CASTLE
Hi. What s up?


Castle and Beckett walk and talk.

BECKETT
You brought a thief to a crime 
scene?

CASTLE
It was very helpful.

BECKETT
It was criminal trespassing.

Long story. But I m working on a 
new one and I gotta tell you, it s 
pretty cool. And I want to get the 
details right.

MITCHELL
They never get it right. Not in

clowns and thugs. They never think 
that maybe we got families,

Castle takes notes.

CASTLE
So my next book s about a crew of

crew that we re looking for now. 
And I ve got this scene where a guy

Powell as he slides into a conversation with Anne Greene.

BECKETT (CONT D)
Castle, a little help!

He snaps back and pulls Beckett to her feet.

CASTLE
It s Powell.

BECKETT
Your jewel thief?*

She follows him off the dance floor, suddenly aware that 
female eyes are on her. To onlookers, it appears they had a 
tiff and he s storming off.


Castle snakes through the crowd, catching Anne Greene and 
Powell in mid-conspire.

CASTLE
(stern, upset)
I can t believe this. You re both 
in on it!

Their startled faces have guilt written all over them.Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" Blue Draft 1-5-09 50A.


ANNE
Don t look at me. It was his idea.Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" Blue Draft 1-5-09 51.


CASTLE
You really had me going there, the 
wine, the cheese, the Code of *
Conduct. And now, here you are, 
making me look like a fool.

POWELL
That was never my intent, dear boy.    
I just wanted to have a bit of fun.

CASTLE
Fun? You call what you did fun?

Beckett arrives.

BECKETT
Castle, what s going on?

CASTLE
(with disgust)
They re both in on it. They ve all 
but admitted it.

ANNE
I m so sorry. I had no idea it was 
such a big deal.

CASTLE
Big deal? Two people are dead!

And now, sudden confusion.

ANNE
Dead? What s he...

POWELL
Oh dear lord. You thought?
(laughs)
No, Ricky, we aren t your thieves.

CASTLE
Then what are you two whispering 
about?

The THUMP THUMP THUMP of a microphone. Powell nods across the 
way to a riser, where Rachel stands before the crowd.

RACHEL
On behalf of our company, thank you *
all for coming tonight.

RACHEL (CONT'D)
Now it s time for all of us to open 
our hearts, and our pocketbooks, as 
we auction off some of the city s 
finest items for one of the finest 
causes. To start the bidding is a 
very special guest... Please 
welcome Martha Rodgers.

Polite applause as Castle tenses. 

CASTLE
(to Powell)
What are you doing?

POWELL
Just a little payback.

MARTHA
Thank you all so much for that 
wonderfully warm reception. The 
first item on tonight s list - a 
signed first edition of Storm 
Season, written by, well, my son.

She waves at Castle. And then...

MARTHA (CONT D)
My still single son. So tonight, as 
a special bonus, the winning bidder 
will also receive an enchanting 
evening in his company. Ladies, 
that s all I can do. The rest is up 
to you. Do I hear an opening bid!

The crowd loves Martha. So does Beckett. This is the most fun 
she s had in a long time, watching as GOLDDIGGERS and OLD 
BIDDIES bid on Castle. Powell smirks.

POWELL
Now we re even. 

Castle turns to Beckett.

CASTLE
I have money. Whatever you bid, 
I ll pay it back.

BECKETT
(grinning)
Not a chance in hell.

Martha drives up the bidding, and all eyes are on stage 
watching her coax more money with phrases like  Twice voted 
most eligible bachelor  and  Knows how to cook.  Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 53.


Castle can t bear to watch. He looks away. But as he does, 
his eyes land on PAUL, Rachel s boyfriend. Castle nudges 
Beckett. She shoots him a look - What?

CASTLE
Donor girl s boyfriend.

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
So he s taking pictures.

BECKETT
(still enjoying his 
embarrassment)
I would be too if I had a camera.

He gives her a look - Very funny. But then he says...

CASTLE
Of the crowd?

This gets Beckett s attention. As all eyes are on the stage, 
Paul s taking pictures with his phone - of people in the 
crowd.

ACT SIX


We find Paul and Rachel chatting up an OLD BIDDIE with a 
quarter million dollars worth of ice around her neck. Beckett 
and Castle approach.

CASTLE
Shopping, are we?

Paul looks up, Rachel looks confused. Beckett flashes her 
badge.

BECKETT
Paul Reynolds, you re under arrest *
on suspicion of theft and 
conspiracy to commit murder.

As Ryan and Esposito move in to cuff him, Castle turns to 
Beckett. Looks at her badge and then at her dress. Tries to 
do the math...

CASTLE
Where was the badge?

BECKETT
Don t ask.Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" Yellow Draft 1-7-09 55.



Esposito, carrying a rap sheet, crosses from his desk to *
Castle (still in his tux) and Ryan.*

ESPOSITO
B & E and firearms are definitely a 
step up for this guy.

Beckett enters behind them.*

BECKETT
He s just a foot soldier. We need 
his general.

She s changed back into her street clothes, washed off her *
party make-up and has tried to comb out her hairdo. *

CASTLE*
What happened to the dress?*

BECKETT*
You didn t think I was going to *
interrogate him in it, did you?*

CASTLE*
We were all kinda hoping.*

Esposito and Ryan shoot her  little brother  grins.*


Beckett, back in her street clothes, listens to his tale. The 
POLICE SKETCH on the table between them.

PAUL
Look, it wasn t my fault, okay? 
(beat)
We met in Green Haven Prison. A guy 
like me? You know they would ve 
eaten me in there. But he looked 
out for me on the yard. They were 
all afraid of him. Even the guards.
(beat)
When he got out, he found me. I 
don t know how. 

BECKETT
Was it his idea to infiltrate the 
charity?

PAUL
I was already seeing Rachel at the 
time. I was trying to go straight. 
(MORE)Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" Yellow Draft 1-7-09 55A.

PAUL (CONT'D)
But he said I owed him. That I 
belonged to him now. 

BECKETT
So you fed him all the top donors.Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" Blue Draft 1-5-09 56.


PAUL
Everything he needed was already in 
their dossiers: names, addresses. I 
took photographs of their jewelry 
and put it all on a flash drive. 
But he wanted more and more. 
(beat)
Detective? After he beat that guy 
to death, I told him I wanted out, 
but he said if I quit he d do 
everything he d saved me from in 
prison. He d do it to me and 
Rachel. 

Beckett holds up the sketch.

BECKETT
Where can I find him?

CUT TO:


BECKETT
Castle, as a friend, do not leave 
this car. Because your Hardy Boy 
act is-

CASTLE
-gonna get me killed, I know.

BECKETT
More likely you d get one of them 
killed. And I can t have that on my 
conscience. Understood?

CASTLE
What if I have to pee?

Beckett hands him an empty paper cup that was left on the *
dashboard and leaves.*


Beckett, Ryan, and Esposito heel-toe down the hall, their 
guns low. Esposito takes a knee next to the DOOR JAM, tucks 
the butt under his right arm, looks back at Beckett. Ready?Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" Blue Draft 1-5-09 57.


Beckett nods, gripping her pistol. Esposito reaches up, 
KNOCKS hard on the door.

ESPOSITO
NYPD! We have a warrant.

Beckett nods at Ryan. Ryan kicks open the door. Yells of 
 HANDS! NYPD! NYPD!  as our cops spill into...


A small one bedroom. Empty, other than various GEAR - the 
kind of gear one would use in a home invasion robbery.  


Castle fidgets, like a bored six-year-old. Finally he scoots 
into the driver s seat, grabs the handset, and pretends to 
key the mike.

CASTLE
(a la Clint Eastwood)
This is Detective Castle to all 
Units. Negatory on the back-up.
(digging himself in the 
rearview)
This dirtbag s all mine.


Maps of the city. Dossiers. Alarm system schematics. Pictures *
of jewelry. It s clear this was central command for our guy. *
But he s gone. Beckett s pissed. Ryan picks up a coffee mug.

RYAN
Still warm. Must ve just missed him.

Beckett pushes back into...


As she comes into the hallway, she spots a FIGURE approaching 
holding a grocery bag. We don t get a clear look at the guy, 
but seeing Beckett, he drops the bag and runs.

BECKETT
Police! Police!

As Beckett pursues, the guy books through a set of doors. 
Beckett gives chase, but the door slams. She shoulders into 
it, but it does not give. And it fucking hurts. She winces.

BECKETT (CONT D)
Ryan! Esposito!Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 58.


She directs them down either side of the hall, as she slams 
into the door again. This time it gives a little. Through the 
door s glass window she can see the guy heading across a 
rooftop courtyard to the edge of the building. She slams into 
the door again.


And here s Castle, sitting in the car pretending he s in a 
car chase. And he s actually humming action-hero theme music. 

CASTLE
Bum-bum- bah-bum-bah-DAAH. De-nah-
NAAAH. De-nah-NAAAH. De-nah-NAAAH-

He grins. Having too much fun for a guy his age when...

WHAM! A body hits the car hood. Castle is face-to-face with 
KARL NADIR, the man from the police sketch, which by the way, 
happens to be on the dash. He looks at Nadir, and then at 
sketch. Yep. That s the guy. And Castle does the only thing 
he can think of with a guy staring at him through the 
windshield. He turns on the wipers.

The wipers smack Nadir s beady-eyed face. Nadir rolls off the 
hood and levels his gun at Castle from the driver s side.

NADIR
Out of the car!

Castle s a little taken aback, as he stares down the barrel 
of Nadir s piece.

CASTLE
But I told her I d...

NADIR
Out of the car now!

Castle starts to open the door and then, BOOM, he shoulders 
it. The door slams Nadir, knocking him back. Nadir s gun goes 
skittering. As Nadir goes after it, Castle gets out of the 
car and slams Nadir just as he s reaching for the gun.

They roll, with Nadir ending on top. He PUNCHES Castle right 
in the face. 

CASTLE
Hey! Ow!

Nadir grabs the gun, but just as he s about to level the 
weapon, we reveal Beckett staring down the barrel of hers.Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" Blue Draft 1-5-09 59.


BECKETT
Go ahead. I need the practice.

On his knees, Nadir laces his fingers behind his head. Ryan 
and Esposito move in to cuff Nadir. Hauling him away.

CASTLE
I tried to stay in the car. I 
really tried.

She shakes her head, amused.

CASTLE (CONT D)
He hit me in the face, y know. 

BECKETT
(grinning)
He sure did.

She offers him a hand and pulls him to his feet.

CASTLE
(imitating her)
 Go ahead. I need the practice.  
That was classic.


The living room is cleaned of feathers. Packing boxes dot the 
room. Joanne and Beckett sit in the living room.

BECKETT
All the other stolen pieces are 
still in evidence, but I didn t see 
the harm in returning this. 

Beckett holds a LOCKET in her palm. Joanne recognizes it, all 
the feelings flooding back.

JOANNE
How do you get over it?

BECKETT
You don t. 

Joanne opens the locket: it contains a photo of Joanne and *
her mother together, a reminder of happier times.  *Castle Ep 106 "Home Is Where The Heart Stops" White Draft 1-2-09 60.


BECKETT (CONT D)
But one day you ll wake up and find 
you don t mind carrying it around 
with you.

That s as far as I ve come.

JOANNE
Thank you, Detective. 

BECKETT
My name s Kate.

If you ever need to talk.


Castle s making eggs for Alexis and Martha. Beckett walks 
into the kitchen. Castle looks up from the stove; he s got a 
nice shiner going. 

BECKETT
Pretty butch, Castle.

CASTLE
I know, right? Pull up a chair.

BECKETT
Nah. I just came by to return your 
Mom s necklace.

CASTLE
You saved my life. At least let me 
make you some eggs.

BECKETT
I should really be going.

MARTHA
Nonsense. You are going to take a 
seat right here and tell us all 
about last night. All we ve heard 
is his version.

Martha tenderly steers Beckett to the table. Alexis pours her 
some coffee. And we FADE OUT on a  family breakfast.
