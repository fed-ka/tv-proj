All we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame-orange
sky...almost like the sky from the burning of Atlanta in
"Gone with the Wind".
SUPERIMPOSE:
Presenter credit.
PAN DOWN lower and lower until we see the terrain below...
the desert.
There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and
odd-shaped rock formations.
The air is filled with red dust,
which alternately obscures and then reveals the image.
CAMERA MOVES FORWARD optically - enlarging the film grain in
the process.
SLOW DISOLVE
OPENING CREDITS BEGIN.
ANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre
rocks.
Dust.
Sound of wind.
CAMERA MOVES FORWARD again.
DISSOLVE.
ANOTHER LANDSCAPE, but this time, in the distance are some
enormous plastic domes.
Sunlight striking them and reflect-
ing causes brilliant rainbows.
CAMERA optically tracks
toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion
through the red dust.
DISSOLVE...
ANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the
arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.
(It is
reminiscent of the Egyptian sphinx, but both body and face,
though gargoyle-like, are different in design.)
There are
some large pyramids not far from the sphinx.
CAMERA MOVES
optically FORWARD.
DISSOLVE.
CAMERA is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front.
It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move)
towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems.
As CAMERA APPROACHES one of the eyes, it appears to be
stained red glass, as in a temple.
Suddenly there is a
terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of
fragments which hurtle toward the camera...
2
CAMERA TRACKS with Quail as he walks along the busy modern
street towards a subway station.
Modern cars (out of focus)
pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail.
There is a
plaintive tune being played on violin.
Quail pauses and
gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on
briskly.
5
Quail walks briskly out onto the street, controlling his
paces, trying not to look suspicious.
After a beat, he
heads for the nearest subway entrance.
22
An OFFICIAL VEHICLE slams to a halt next to the subway
entrance and a whole load of INTENSE MEN pours out of it.
24
Quail emerges from underground and looks around.
The
streets are almost deserted.
28
A cab comes into view.
Quail quickly hails it and jumps
in.
Cab moves off.
28B
A wide shot shows that the cab is being fired on by a man
leaning from the window of an official patrol vehicle.
He
is aiming at the tires and driver, rather than directly at
Quail.
28D
Cars continue, as Quail picks himself up from the gutter
and moves off down a narrow side street.
28F
The taxi mounts the footpath and smashes through the display
window of a store.
Clothes models are scattered and broken.
When the noise abates, the severed head of the robot driver
is lying among the dummies.
ROBOT DRIVER
This company, sir or madam,
will institute legal action
for damages...
29
Quail emerges from the side street and sees "End of the
Line" Hotel.
It is clean, bland, middle class.
He quickly
crosses the road and enters.
29A
The OV slams up in front of the hotel and a carload of
MEN tear out of it and barge into the hotel.
32A
Quail is walking along briskly, still with the towel
around his head.
A few passers-by look at him curiously.
He puts his hand together and greets them Indian-style.
33
which reads: "PARK AVENUE / 58TH STREET".
PULL BACK to reveal "The Lucky Stub Pawnshop".
WINOS
lurk on the corner.
Park Avenue has deteriorated into
a slum.
QUAIL ENTERS FRAME, and approaching the pawnshop, stepping
over a BUM in a doorway.
34
The car pulls up.
Another follows it.
Armed men leap
out from both.
The EARPLUG WEARER indicates they should
go down an alley at the side of a service door.
They
advance cautiously, guns at the ready.
They see no one.
The EARPLUG WEARER indicates another, even narrower, alley
leading off to one side.
Two of the men sneak cautiously
up to it, their guns at the ready.
A large rat scurries out from behind overfull garbage
bins.
Furious, they fire.
The bullets rip the bins to
shreds, scattering refuse everywhere.
The rat is killed.
They all stare in disbelief.
EARPLUG WEARER
Ya dirty rat!
40
The SPACELINER -- which we have deliberately not seen before
this moment for dramatic effect -- banks and turns, suddenly
bringing into view -- MARS.
AN IMMENSE ORANGE GLOBE -- so close it looks like it's
going to fall on us.
It dwarfs the spaceliner.
CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
Those long gorges you see,
clearly are the legendary
canals of Mars....
The liner drops toward the surface of Mars.
Below:
a
NETWORK OF INTERSECTING LINES crisscross the planet.
CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
(continuing)
Of course, they are not manmade
canals, but vast natural chasms
...many deeper and larger than
the Grand Canyon.
Though
utterly without moisture now,
scientists have determined
that they were formed by
massive flooding millions of
years ago.
47
CAMERA follows the spaceliner until the ENTIRE FRAME is
filled with the RED-ORANGE sands of MARS.
49
An endless expanse of boulder-studded red sand, under
a red-orange sky.
The desert is cut by a ROAD, which snakes across the
rocky terrain.
Some surface TRAFFIC moves along the
road (all pressurized vehicles since the atmosphere
of Mars is almost a pure vacuum) - including the
MARSPORT BUS.
PAN WITH THE BUS - TO REVEAL
A CITY UNDER A DOME.
In the midst of the stark, trackless landscape -- it's
midday, scorching -- rises a huge weatherbeaten GEODESIC
STRUCTURE, its glass surface scarred by sandstorm damage.
Its feeling is like an old Western, when Clint Eastwood
rides into Tombstone -- the raw, forbidding vistas, with
a tough town carved out of the wilderness.
50
The bus pulls up outside a modern tourist hotel.
The
buildings surrounding it have a much more improvised,
temporary look.
Most are pre-fabricated structures.
The streets are crowded and there is a "frontier-town"
atmosphere.
Stalls sell fruit and vegetables, also water
and air containers.
A lot of greenery is evident - this is to absorb CO2 and
emit oxygen, thus helping with the air supply under the
dome.
Some small, ragged boys look at QUAIL as he looks around
before going inside the hotel.
Suddenly, one of them throws
a small sack at him.
It hits his chest and leaves a yellow
stain.
The hotel DOORMAN chases the boys away....
BOY
Smogpsucker!
From the other side of the street, a gang of URCHINS with
a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant PATRIOTIC
SONG.
DOORMAN
You know how it is, sir.
Some
of these red-asses are a bit
prejudiced.
QUAIL
Prejudiced?
Against what?
DOORMAN
Earthmen.
The street song has swelled, adult MINERS and CITIZENS
joining the belligerent chorus.
QUAIL
What are they singing?
DOORMAN
The Martian National Anthem.
Quail tips the doorman, enter the hotel.
57
It is now sunset on Mars and it's literally of inearthly
beauty.
The sun is bold and blood red;
the foggy, drip-
ping glass of the Dome tints the light into strange colors.
Quail emerges from the hotel, properly attired now in a
white tropical suit, and starts for the taxi stand.
Behind him, also emerging from the hotel, is the Shoeshine
Boy.
He keeps out of sight -- but is definitely tailing
Quail.
As Quail nears the first solar-powered taxi in line, he is
approached by an amiable-looking CALYPSO GUY wearing a West
Indian shirt and bright straw hat.
CALYPSO GUY (BENNIE)
Need a cab, boss mon?
Quail hesitates, unsure of the protocol.
BENNIE
(continuing)
Mine's right around the corner.
QUAIL
(indicating first
cab in line)
That one's closer.
BENNIE
But I out-hustle him, right?
QUAIL
(smiling)
Right.
TWO CABBIES exchange curses as Quail, wary, follows the
Calypso Guy around a corner, climbs into the small solar
car.
62
An AIR LOCK whooshes open underneath a Checker Cab sign.
Bennie and Quail emerge in the solar-powered car -- set
off into the desert.
63
The taxi traverses the same type desert that Quail crossed
a few hours ago.
Only now is looks completely different.
The late light tints everything in pastel shades, Quail is
awed by the grandeur of the Lawrence-of-Arabia-like setting.
68
Quail and Bennie's taxi approaches a brightly-lit oasis in
the middle of the desert.
There's a cafe, repair facilities
and a huge parking lot -- all under a garish neon sign:
"LAST CHANCE AIR STATION AND ASLOON - EAT HERE AND GET GAS".
Quail and Bennie's taxi pulls in and parks.
In the lot is
a collection of strange and colorful vehicles:
huge ore
trucks that pull eight trailers, mountain prospecting jeeps,
Grapes-of-Wrath jalopies.
Quail and Bennie disembark, wear-
ing breathing masks, and enter the main building.
69
Quail and Melina run from a basement door into an alley.
A solar car whips out in front of them.
Quail and Melina
leap aboard.
MELINA
Go, Bennie, for God's sake!
86
A large gas-powered official-looking car is pushing its way
through the crowds and traffic behind them.
86B
GUNFIRE blazes all around the car.
Quail FIRES back at
the pursuing car.
QUAIL
(shouts over
GUNFIRE)
You're gonna get a ticket
for that engine, Bennie --
BENNIE
Yutani 650 -- you like it,
boss?
Nothing like the old
gas when you want a bit of
speed.
BULLETS from the cruiser rip through the car.
MELINA
You better have two aces,
Bennie.
(glances behind)
There's a second cruiser --
and it's gaining --
87A
Bennie's car hurtles through the crowds with the official
car gaining on it.
Bennie takes a corner sharply near a
huge water selling stand.
The official car brakes to make
the same turn, but clips the side of the water stand.
The
water container tips and empties water through the open
roof (i.e. through which one of the Agents has been firing)
so that the car completely fills.
The driver continues the
chase, but the occupants are now submerged.
They frantic-
ally open the windows while continuing to follow Bennie's
car.
88
The solar car rushes down what appears to be a dead-end
street, with the official vehicle (water pouring out of
the windows) in pursuit.
At the end of the street, however, Bennie doesn't stop but
continues going into a large opening.
It is an abandoned
mine.
The bigger car follows him, but won't fit.
The
roof is smashed to pieces as the vehicle is wedged into
the narrow opening.
The second official car pulls up behind.
A chauffeur jumps
out and opens the rear door.
Cohaagen steps out.
He sur-
veys the scene.
The four men in the wrecked car clamber
their way backwards out of the wreckage.
They are covered
in blood and their clothes are in shreds.
COHAAGEN
I take it, then, you've failed
to get him again.
Cohaagen turns to an associate, EMILE, a youngish,
well-dressed executive type.
COHAAGEN
(continuing)
Proceed with Operation Sphinx.
EMILE
But, sir...
COHAAGEN
With him...
(gestures toward
the mine)
...on the lose, I'm not
taking any more chances.
Operation Sphinx will flush
him out.
93
Bennie, Quail and Melina are walking in a crowded area
of town.
Water sellers and food stalls are everywhere.
An ARMORED LOUDSPEAKER VEHICLE appears, broadcasting to
the crowd.
It is also swinging a powerful searchlight
along the footpaths and streets.
VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER
...all residents are to
report to their nearest
space-travel agent within
twelve hours, all residents
will be departing on shuttles
within twenty-four hours.
Air
and water supplies will be cut
off at that time.
I repeat...
MELINA
He's doing it!
QUAIL
What?
Why?
MELINA
Clearing everyone out!
It's
been rumored for months...
The searchlight approaches Bennie, Quail and Melina.
Bennie
ducks into a doorway, while Quail grabs Melina and kisses
her passionately.
The light sees only the back of his head.
She responds warmly to his kiss.
QUAIL
Wow.
I can see why I was
willing to betray E.I.O.
MELINA
I though you believed in
our cause?
QUAIL
Yes.
Of course.
That, too.
They move into the crowd.
The message on the
loudspeaker is repeated.
101
Scaffolding and excavation works cover a wall of the Sphinx;
the Sphinx's huge CARVED FACE visible in the background.
Quail and several other E.I.O. agents stand poised, wearing
breathing masks and protective gear, as a powerful
excavation device prizes back a huge stone, revealing
an ENTRANCE TO SOME KIND OF HIDDEN CHAMBER.
The other agents are fearful, don't want to proceed.
Quail
ignores them, enters the chamber --
107A
CLOSE - QUAIL'S FACE
As he enters.
We read awe, shock and fascination on his
features.
He approaches something we can't see.
His
hand reaches out.
Suddenly, a bolt of incredible powerful energy flashes out,
striking Quail like a bolt of lightning.
WHITE LIGHT.
105
Quail, Melina and Bennie make their way through the crowds
to Bennie's depot.
The streets are even busier then before -
people are now beginning to evacuate the city.
Everyone is
carrying their possessions - bundles, suitcases, pets, etc.,
etc.
The loudspeaker vans are still touring and broad-
casting the same message.
Bennie indicates a building on their left.
115
GUARDS are carefully checking every vehicle leaving the
city, though this has to be done fairly rapidly because
of the inhabitants leaving for the Space Ports.
The vehicle with Bennie, Quail and Melina arrives.
115B
In a wide shot, the vehicle is traversing the desert.
The
domed city is some distance in the background.
Voices are
heard in false perspective.
Emphasis is on the dry and
hostile natural landscape of Mars.
QUAIL
That's right.
Air and water.
Terriforming will create a
permanent livable environment
for Mars.
No more pressurized
cities, no more containers in
the desert.
There'll be
rivers, vegetation - life -
the same as Earth.
MELINA
(baffled)
So why is Cohaagen shipping
everyone out?
QUAIL
Don't you see?!
From being
a pile of red dirt with
minerals, Mars is going to
change into
a chunk of
priceless real estate.
MELINA
And Cohaagen's going to own
it all!
QUAIL
Right!
He can start selling
it off to well-heeled investors
from Earth.
Beach condos, ski
resorts, you name it.
MELINA
No wonder he wanted you to...
penetrate... out group.
QUAIL
(nods)
Once word of this gets out,
the whole planet will support
you.
117
The vehicle is now approaching the Sphinx.
Both it and
the pyramids can be seen some distance away.
Voice are heard in CU perspective.
MELINA
So what can we do?
QUAIL
Ruin his little scheme by
terriforming ahead of
schedule - while the
inhabitants are still here.
Melina is amazed.
MELINA
But who'll work the machine?
Do you know how?
QUAIL
I'm the only one who does.
Why do you think Cohaagen's
left me alone all this time?
118
The vehicle is even closer to the Sphinx.
QUAIL
I was the first one inside
when they cracked the riddle
of the Sphinx.
It must've
been programmed.
Some kind
of...force...shot into me.
MELINA
But Cohaagen wiped your
memory!!!
QUAIL
(smoothly)
Just a way of putting me on
ice.
He'd of reversed it
once the planet was evacuated.
BENNIE
Man!
This is real complicated.
Go over it again, real slow.
119
A wide shot shows a total of four patrol vehicles approach-
ing the vehicle with Quail, Melina and Bennie.
Suddenly,
it stops moving.
120
The E.I.O. vehicle are a half mile off -- and closing in.
122
Bennie is beside the vehicle.
He implodes like a balloon
with all its air gone.
122AB
Melina hides her face in horror.
At that instant --
122A
Bullets dig into the sand all around the vehicle.
The
patrol cars are only a few hundred yards away!
Loud-
speakers call for Quail's surrender.
122B
The vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand.
As the
patrol cars close in and rake the desert with gunfire,
the vehicle vanishes from sight.
In the distance, the
Sphinx looms ominously.
A driver in one of the patrol vehicles (filmed from outside
the windscreen) is speaking into a microphone.
He can't
be heard but can only be radioing a report.
123
Quail and Melina climb through the outer air lock door.
They are at the Sphinx's shoulder, with a dizzying drop
beneath them.
Melina looks down.
She's sorry she did:
the fall is at least 200 feet.
(Both are wearing their
breathing apparatus.)
Quail and Melina start to climb.
Up the Sphinx's shoulder,
along its Egyptian-like headdress --
141
Quail and Melina traverse across the cheekbones, haul
themselves up at the base of the red translucent eyes --
142A
Quail jams THREE GRENADES against the glass of the eyes,
pulls Melina back behind the stone cheeks --
143
The hands belong to breather-masked MINERS, dismounting
rapidly from an overloaded transport vehicle which was
taking them to the Space Port.
Quail looks from them to
Melina, who is walking towards the group.
QUAIL'S P.O.V. - MINERS' MASKED FACES
The miners' desert garb, shield goggles and breathers add
to the surreal nightmare quality of Quail's tortured
perspective --
BACK TO QUAIL
In terror, lost, disoriented totally.
QUAIL
Am I dying?
MASKED MINER
I won't lie to you, pal.
You are.
MINER (from Melina's bar)
I'd say in about forty years...
(he and others
help Quail to
his feet)
...come on, we've gotta get
to the Space Port.
That
Intergalactic Napoleon's
switched off the air.
2ND MINER
Shippin' us all out.
Mars
is finished.
A MINER'S WIFE watches them.
She is crying.
Quail looks up at the sky.
Melina follows his glance.
So do the others.
Slowly, but perceptibly, the color is changing from yellow
to blue.
MELINA
It's happening.
MINER
What is it?
All the miners are puzzled, apprehensive.
Quail reaches
toward the one who spoke to him before and pulls off his
breathing apparatus.
At first the man is shocked, then
realizes he can breathe without it.
Quail takes off
his own, then Melina's
All the miners watch in amazement.
They all remove their
breathing masks.
QUAIL
That's just the start.
Next
there'll be rain and growth
and ... life.
Melina embraces him.
QUAIL
(continuing)
Rekall could never have come
up with anything like this.
Melina looks oddly at him, smiling, mysterious.
As the sky becomes more and more blue, more of the Miners
descend from the bus.
Softly at first, then with more and
more confidence, they begin singing the Martian National
Anthem.
The music swells.
Quail puts his arm around Melina.
They
both join in the chorus.
It reaches an impassioned crescendo as the FRAME FREEZES
and the END CREDITS ROLL UP the screen.
THE END
Total Recall
