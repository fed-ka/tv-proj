  Dry, deserted, silent.  If there were any signs of life, they d 
  point to spring, 1975.  But there are no cars, no people, no 
  stray dogs. 

  SUDDENLY a six-year-old boy runs into frame.  This is YOUNG 
  CALL.  He s sweaty, dirty, scared, and RUNNING for his life.  
  His worn-out chucks kick up dirt.  

  His heart pounds faster than his feet.  He looks behind him.  
  We re not sure what he sees yet, but it scares him enough to RUN 
  even harder.  Everything gets brighter, and whiter, and FREEZES 
  into a NEGATIVE.  Then REAL TIME again.  There s a POP and FLASH 
  and we re suddenly in --

  Close.  Messy.  A man.  A shiny blade.  A violent struggle.  
  BLOOD, source unknown, is everywhere.

  Call walks with his head down.  He pulls his jacket closed.

  Another fractured memory of Young Call, running for his life.

                Call s never driven in his life.

                He s outnumbered.  You think he s

                I think he took the boy for a 
                reason.  

                              MITCHELL
                I don t care why he took him.  

                              HOTCH
                You should.  Call s memory isn t 
                  suppressed anymore.  He s 
                  reinventing his past.  Until we do 
                the same, we ll never find either 
                of them.

                I m not going to sit around and

                All we had to do was stop and look 
                at Foyet s history.  We didn t.  We 
                lost two couples and a bus full of

  The woman s gurney is taken to the ambulance.  They all watch.

  Young Tommy s over the fence.  Young Call can t get to safety.  
  The man, his face a crimson mask, catches Young Call.  He s got 
  his buck knife in the boy s face while he yells at him.  

                              YOUNG JARVIS
                You think you can get away?  Is 
                that what you think you stupid 
                little bastard --   

  Young Call pushes the knife into Young Jarvis  face.  He goes 
  down.  Covers his face.  Blood s everywhere.  Young Call RUNS 
  for his life.  He looks back.

                We ve gotta hurry, Tommy.  He s 
                gonna get us.  

  The boy can t get out of the speeding car.  He s stuck and we --

  Young Tommy s in a metal cage.  Young Call is not in the cage.  
  He cleans up.  Adds clothes and rags to a pile near the barrel.  

                              YOUNG TOMMY
                Hey kid. Did the old man pass out? 

  Young Call looks, nods yes. Young Tommy points to the keys.  

                              YOUNG TOMMY (cont'd)
                Can you reach those?  

  Young Call struggles but reaches the keys.  

                              YOUNG TOMMY (cont'd)
                You can do it.  Go ahead.  

  His hands are too little to hold the master lock and keys.  
  Young Tommy takes them, unlocks it and climbs out.  

                              YOUNG TOMMY (cont'd)
                Come on.  

  Young Tommy pulls Young Call with him.  A DOG BARKS.  The boys 
  look to the man s chair, but it s empty.  They RUN anyway -- 
  right into the man.  He whacks them both.  

                                                                              CUT TO:


  The man opens the cover to his red pick-up.  There s bags of 
  lime and Young Tommy, hands tied.  He uses the buck knife to  
  cut the rope from his wrists.  Young Call stands behind the man.  
  He s got the shovel.  It s almost bigger than him.  Young Tommy 
  thrashes and spits on the man.  He steps back -- and onto Young 
  Call.  He loses his footing.  Young Tommy takes advantage.  
  Grabs the shovel and WHACKS the man with it.  The man goes down, 
  head bleeding.  Tommy drops it, grabs the kid and runs.

  This is what we ve seen from the beginning.  Only now Tommy s 
  ahead of him.  He gets to a fence and starts to climb it.   

                              YOUNG TOMMY
                Come on, you can make it.    

  Young Call tries to catch up to him, but FALLS.  The man drives 
  the red pick-up and quickly catches up to him.  Tommy makes it 
  over the fence and looks back.  There s no way the kid will make 
  it.  Either Young Tommy keeps going or they both get killed.   
  He hesitates.  Doesn t want to leave the kid... 

                              YOUNG CALL
                Go, Tommy.  Run.  

  He watches as young Call is yanked off the ground, his little 
  feet dangling.

  Circa 1975.  Chipped paint.  No love.  Red pick-up in the gravel 
  driveway.  Young Call kicks the gravel as he walks toward the 
  house.  He walks up some stairs and inside --


  Houses sit on top of one another.  An elementary school yard 
  takes up a few blocks.  Suburbans race down the road.

  The minivan s half on the curb.  An old black pick-up in the

                Flip a coin.

                It doesn t have to end like that.  
                If we get a confession from Jarvis, 
                he goes away and Call gets his
