From an AERIAL VIEW we see the outline of a city.
Any city will
do.
Mirrored high rises.
Sprawling apartment complexes.
A
lot of people live here...whoever they are.
As we move closer we discover that this is not a real city at
all, but a scale model of one.
Everything is in miniature -- the buildings, parks, and freeways.
GLIDING over this tabletop metropolis, we find that none of
the buildings have roofs, allowing us to peak inside.
VARIOUS CLOSE ANGLES
We FLOAT through miniature coffee shops, offices, and bedrooms,
where toy figures are arranged in tableau of everyday life
A man dines alone.
A woman walks her dog.
Two kiss on the street.
One waits for a bus.
Over this we HEAR Marianne Faithful's smoky-voiced cover of the
standard "When We're Alone"
Just picture a penthouse Way up in the sky, With hinges on chimney
For stars to go by, A sweet slice of heaven For just you and
I, When we're alone.
From all of society We'll stay aloof, And live in propriety There
on the roof, Two heavenly hermits We'll be in true, When we're
alone.
As the song ends we find a miniature girl who lies on a miniature
bed.
CUT TO:
Lorna, dressed casually, walks to the bus stop.
Reading the
crossword puzzle in the paper, she doesn't see the curb and trips,
spilling her purse.
Embarrassed, she gathers her things, then takes a seat next to
a Latino Woman.
Lorna smiles and resumes work on the puzzle.
Stumped by a clue, she turns to the Woman.
LORNA
Hmm.
Simon and Garfunkel hit.
Eight letters.
Any thoughts?
The Woman shrugs and looks off.
Suddenly, Lorna's phone rings.
She reaches into her purse but
it's not there.
Then, she spots it...in the street.
But the
moment she goes to get it, a truck roars past and smashes it
to smithereens.
LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Oh my god.
But as she scoops up the pieces in her hand a smile creeps across
her face.
LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
No, this is right.
This is exactly right.
CUT TO
A revival house in a college neighborhood.
The ticket seller
hangs a "Sold Out" sign in the box office window, just as Todd
and SARAH come running down the sidewalk.
SARAH
Shit!
Sold out!
Sarah, at twenty-five, is cute, brainy, articulate, and hopelessly
insecure.
They lean against the wall and catch their breath.
SARAH
I am so sorry.
TODD
That's alright.
I hear it's really overrated.
And long.
SARAH
I could just kill him!
This is not the first time he's done
this, either.
TODD
Done what?
SARAH
Cooked up some phony emergency, right as I'm getting on the elevator.
TODD
He's your boss.
Being an asshole is part of the job description.
SARAH
We're talking about the most self-centered man I have ever met.
God forbid I should have a life, right?
(beat)
But I'm not going to let him do it.
TODD
Do what?
SARAH
Ruin my evening.
Our evening.
(without a beat)
You know, he also thinks he's God's gift to women.
I'm surprised
he hasn't been sued by now...Okay, okay.
Stop me.
He takes her by the shoulders.
TODD
Sarah.
Take a breath.
SARAH
Okay.
I'm taking a breath.
And she does.
TODD
Now, take another one.
SARAH
I like you.
Have I told you that?
TODD
Not today.
SARAH
You know what I want to do?
I want to go shopping.
TODD
Shopping?
For what?
SARAH
For a house.
TODD
(completely thrown)
Just what I was thinking.
CUT TO
Early morning.
The air is cool and crisp as Sarah, wearing sweats
and a T-shirt, jogs through the neighborhood.
She turns down a side street, heading for--
A nondescript house with a faded American flag hanging off the
front porch.
Sarah climbs the steps where an elderly man --
her GRANDFATHER, sits with the morning paper in his lap, unread.
Sarah gives him a kiss.
SARAH
Morning, Pappy.
How's she doing today?
GRANDFATHER
Don't pay her any mind, Sarah.
The things she says, they get
stranger by the day.
Sarah pays him no mind and heads into the house.
CUT TO
Sarah and her GRANDMOTHER sit on the back porch, which offers
a splendid view of...other people's back porches.
Sarah's Grandmother has a sense of mischief that's quite at odds
with her deteriorating frame.
The two drink coffee.
GRANDMOTHER
They keep telling me I'm doing fine, that I'm even improving.
Why do they have to lie?
At my age?
What are they trying to
protect me from?
SARAH
Maybe they know something you don't.
GRANDMOTHER
Like hell.
She pulls out a pack of American Spirit cigarettes and lights
one.
Sarah reacts.
SARAH
Nan.
GRANDMOTHER
What?
One in the morning with coffee.
One at night with cocktails.
Where was I?
(beat)
Oh, yes.
My story is coming to an end, Sarah--
SARAH
Oh, please.
GRANDMOTHER
Your story, that's the one I want to hear.
SARAH
I wish I had a story to tell.
GRANDMOTHER
Hmm.
The last time there was talk of an admirer.
SARAH
All you want is dirt, Nan.
Admit it.
GRANDMOTHER
The world is made of dirt, Sarah.
So, please, dish.
No detail
is too small.
SARAH
I...I'm sleeping with two different men.
GRANDMOTHER
Hmm.
Continue.
SARAH
One of them is a good man.
He's good for me.
GRANDMOTHER
Like vitamins.
SARAH
Sort of.
The other one, he can be a complete ass.
A total jerk.
GRANDMOTHER
In other words...he excites you.
SARAH
He does.
And I hate it.
I hate him.
And, on top of that, I
can't have him.
GRANDMOTHER
Can you see your Pappy?
Sarah looks back over her shoulder.
She catches a glimpse of
her Grandfather.
He's still on the front porch.
SARAH
He hasn't moved.
GRANDMOTHER
Good.
Keep an eye on him.
SARAH
Why?
GRANDMOTHER
Because I'm going to tell you something he shouldn't hear.
Something
no one knows.
Once, I had two lovers.
One was your grandfather.
He had prospects, then.
He had a car and we drove everywhere
and people would look at us and say, "Now, there goes a couple."
He never pushed me.
He told me he respected my virginity.
And I liked that.
They hear a loud creak.
SARAH
Don't worry.
He's not moving.
GRANDMOTHER
The other man -- he was a boy, really -- he had no prospects.
And he had no car.
And he had no respect...for anything.
He
certainly had no respect for my virginity.
And I liked that,
too.
She takes a long, luxurious drag.
GRANDMOTHER
But I had to make a choice.
I chose your grandfather.
The day
before the wedding, I went to let the other boy down.
Met him
by a river where we used to swim.
Well, one thing led to another,
and when I returned home that night, I'd left my virginity back
in the tall grass by that river.
Sarah sits on the edge of her chair.
GRANDMOTHER
But I did bring something back.
A bite mark.
That sonuvabitch
left on my neck, the size of a peach pit.
SARAH
Did Pappy see it?
GRANDMOTHER
He did and he didn't.
On the wedding night -- in this house
-- I managed to squeak by.
It was dark.
We were shy.
He took
me in his arms and said, "I'm glad you waited for me."
In other
words, I lost my virginity twice in the same week.
They both laugh.
SARAH
No small feat.
GRANDMOTHER
It's an accomplishment.
But the next morning, your Pappy saw
it.
He demanded an explanation.
And, Sarah, do you know how
I got out of that pickle?
SARAH
You lied.
GRANDMOTHER
Damn right.
I said, "What, you don't remember giving me this?"
He said, "No."
And I said, "Well, you were so fired up last
night, it's a wonder you can remember anything."
(beat)
And the beast was tamed.
Sarah considers the story.
SARAH
And you've never been tempted to...
GRANDMOTHER
What?
Come clean with your Pappy?
Why should I tell him?
He
had nothing to do with it.
SARAH
Right.
GRANDMOTHER
It's mine.
Not his.
SARAH
I wonder what became of that boy.
GRANDMOTHER
Never saw him again.
I don't regret a thing, if that's what
you're wondering.
SARAH
I was, in fact.
GRANDMOTHER
Look what I have.
I have you.
(beat)
And you know what else?
I have the tall grass by that river.
And those clouds.
From where I was laying the clouds looked
really beautiful that day.
CUT TO
Sarah and Todd eat lunch on a bench in a busy promenade.
Deli
sandwiches in wax paper rest on their laps.
SARAH
I can't put my finger on it...I just don't feel it's happening
with us.
TODD
You don't want it work out, that's what you're saying.
SARAH
I do.
I mean, I did.
It's no one's fault.
It's chemistry.
Beat.
TODD
You want your pickle?
SARAH
Do you want your pickle?!
TODD
You know what the problem is?
The first night we went out, we
should've just fucked.
Right away.
Without thinking.
Two dumb
bunnies.
Without any history,
any baggage.
A pair of blank
slates.
Fucking.
It could've been perfectly meaningless.
You
want chemistry?
The less you think, the better the chemistry.
Less talk, more action.
SARAH
I'm sorry.
It's just not happening for me.
TODD
The least you can do is give me your goddam pickle.
They look away from each other.
Todd eats in silence.
The pickle
sits between them.
CUT TO
Josh's model come to life.
A fallow stretch of land lined with
unfinished houses, some more skeletal than others.
At one site we find two parked cars.
A gold Lincoln Navigator
and an old BMW convertible.
CUT TO
Josh and Sarah get into their respective cars -- her BMW, his
Navigator.
Josh looks at himself in the rear-view mirror.
He reacts--
JoSH
What the hell is this?
Sarah looks over.
joSH (cont'd)
You bit me on the neck!
I've got a goddam hickey!
Sure enough, there is a bright red mark on his neck.
Sarah comes over.
She reacts with shock, embarrassment, then...laughter.
joSH (cont'd)
What's so goddam funny?
You did this on purpose, didn't you?
sarah
I did not.
I was just...I didn't mean to...I was caught up in
the moment.
And she laughs again.
jOSH
What the hell are we going to do about this?
sARAH
Josh, you are a big boy.
You can take care of this on your own.
Josh glares at her, starts his engine, and leaves her in the
dust.
cUT TO:
In the driveway of his fashionable home are two parked cars.
Josh's Mercedes S430 and his wife's Lexus RX300.
In the Mercedes, Josh finishes applying the concealer to his
neck.
He checks himself in the mirror -- the hickey is completely
gone.
His hands, however, have concealer all over them.
CUT TO
The Mercedes pulls up to the "Happiness Chinese Restaurant."
Josh and Gwen get out and take in the sight--
GWEN
We don't have to do this tonight.
JOSH
Yes, we do.
She peers in the window.
GWEN
We can't go in here.
Everything's different.
He opens the door for her.
JOSH
That's okay.
We're different, too.
CUT TO
Josh and Gwen approach their car.
It's late.
Behind them, the
restaurant is closing.
JOSH
By the way, I didn't get your name.
GWEN
What?
(off his smile)
Oh, my name.
She glances across the street.
A shop window sign reads, "Bail
Bonds."
GWEN
My name is Gail.
Gail Bonds.
JOSH
Well, Gail, I'm not usually this forward on a first date, may
I take you to my car and ravish you?
GWEN
Hmm.
On one condition.
JOSH
What's that?
GWEN
That you tell me your name.
JOSH
Oh, I thought everyone knew my name.
I'm Bill Gates.
Billionaire.
She laughs.
Rosalie is on the front steps.
She smiles as she hears the door
open -- it's David.
He joins her.
DAVID
I've got nothing to say to you.
ROSALIE
Fine.
I'll talk...
A beat.
ROSALIE
The reason I won't just leave you alone is not because I'm "confused."
My feelings are perfectly clear.
I know you find it incomprehensible
that I can love Jerry and love you.
And that one love has nothing
to do with the other.
But it's true.
DAVID
Rose...
ROSALIE
What?
DAVID
This is bullshit.
I can't spell it out any more plainly.
It's
impossible!
ROSALIE
Why?
DAVID
Because I can't be this close to you...and not want to touch
you.
ROSALIE
That's it?
DAVID
That's...it.
And he does touch her.
He puts his hand on her leg.
DAVID
And if I can't do that, I don't want to be your friend.
Not
now.
Not ever.
ROSALIE
Don't be so mean.
David flashes an angry look.
Then, he pulls Rosalie close to
him.
DAVID
The bottom line is...If I'm with you, I have to touch you, to
kiss you.
That doesn't work for friends, does it?
She doesn't answer -- she lets him stroke her leg.
DAVID
When I'm not with you -- this is more than you need to know...If
I touch myself, I can only think about one person. You.
No one
else.
Just you.
(beat)
Friends...that's bullshit.
ROSALIE
What do we do?
DAVID
What do you mean "we"?
This is your problem.
(beat)
My only problem is how to get you out of my mind.
How to erase
you...Delete every bit of you...
(presses an imaginary key)
Into the ether...
ROSALIE
Stop...
She kisses him.
He engulfs her in his arms.
DAVID
You have to say good-bye.
ROSALIE
I don't know how...
CUT TO
Lorna and Terri walk briskly down the sidewalk.
They round a
corner to see--
A magnificent Catholic church. A white limousine -- decorated
with streamers -- sits in front, surrounded by expensive cars.
TERRI
Well, what do you know...
Lorna can't believe it -- she almost feels betrayed.
TERRI
Told you we should've dressed up.
LORNA
C'mon...we're going inside.
TERRI
What for?
Wait...
But Lorna is bounding toward the cathedral.
CUT TO
Lorna and Terri race down the church steps, giggling like school
girls.
They turn a corner, lean against a wall.
Catching her breath,
Terri lights a cigarette.
LORNA
I don't know why he came back.
(beat)
It wasn't love.
TERRI
Guess you'll never know for sure.
They start down the sidewalk--
TERRI
Remember the guy I told you about -- the writer?
LORNA
Yeah.
He said he wanted to immortalize you.
What a line.
TERRI
He's been steady work.
Every Tuesday for the past month.
Well,
get this.
Yesterday, he called and asked me out.
LORNA
On a date?
TERRI
Yeah.
A date.
LORNA
A non-paying date.
TERRI
No money will be exchanged.
You want to hear the weird part?
I said yes.
LORNA
You're right.
That is weird.
TERRI
You gotta keep an open mind, Lorna.
(beat)
You never know with people.
They wait at the crosswalk.
Lorna idly glances at the window
of a brownstone apartment.
WHAT LORNA SEES
A Man finishing a cigarette.
He catches Lorna looking his way.
A Woman comes up behind the Man and casually embraces him.
The Man gives Lorna a last look before pulling the curtains closed.
The light has changed.
Terri starts walking.
TERRI
C'mon, what are you waiting for?
ON LORNA
She lingers at the curb for a moment, pondering her next move.
