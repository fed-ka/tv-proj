    The dance floor of the V-Clubis vast and more akin to 
      Lincoln Center than a contemporary nightclub, with a ceiling 
      arching easily five stories over our heads and walls lined 
      with dozens of small private balconies.  The teens are packed 
    so tight on the dance floor below that their bodies appear to 
      send ripples and waves marching across the vast sea of 
      humanity.

    ZOE GRAYSTONE

      Watches the scene from one of the small balconies overhanging *
    the dance floor.  She s sixteen -- going on forty -- her hair 
    and makeup severe and out of place in this world of full-
      throated revelry.  Her little black dress is fashionable and 
      perfectly tailored, but not as overtly sexual as the many 
      more revealing outfits on display down below.

      A DOZEN HALF-NAKED FEMALE DANCERS

      Move out onto the stage from the wings.  Exuding sexuality 
      with every tightly choreographed step, they begin dancing and 
      strutting for the crowd.

    The music pulses FASTER.

      A STATUE 

      Rises from beneath the stage to tower over the still-dancing 
      women.  The statue depicts HECATE, Goddess of the underworld 
    and the dark rites, her voluptuous woman s body topped by the 
      lurid heads of three beasts: a LION, a HORSE, and a DOG.  

    THE CROWD

      Goes WILD with excitement.        "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/063.

      Looks down in disgust.

                    Is she there?

    Zoe glances over as BEN STARK, another sixteen year old 
      dressed in simple black clothes and sporting close-cropped 
      hair steps up next to her.  There s an intensity to Ben, a 
      sense of a kid who s gone someplace far away and may not be 
      coming back.

      REVEAL LACY RAND, another sixteen year old girl,running up *

      that both Ben and Zoe exude, instead conveying the more 
      familiar angst and anxieties of a typical girl her age.*

      Lost in their own frenzied passions, their bodies completely 
      intertwined.

                    You know the expression --  Like 
                    someone just walked over my grave. 

    Ben grins and then looks down into the crowd --

      MOVING THROUGH THE CROWD

    We snake past the screaming, crazed teens to where we see the 
      BACK OF A GIRL wearing a mottled green HEADBANDstanding in 
      front, just to the left of center stage.  Unlike the rest of 
    the dancing and partying teens around her, she s standing 
      stock still, rooted in place before stage.

    WE MOVE around her to reveal her face --

    She looks just like Zoe Graystone.  Too exact to be a 
      coincidence and too perfect to be her twin, this woman is an 
      exact replica of Zoe, and soon we ll learn that the 
      resemblance is more than physical.  Call her ZOE-A.

      Zoe-A watches the faces of the teens around her on every side 
    -- the wild, leering smiles, the overt sexuality and 
      lasciviousness on open display -- with an expression more of 
      sadness and heartbreak than the judgement and moralism of the 
      real Zoe and her friends up above.  The music BUILDS --

    THE MASKED MAN

      Suddenly pulls a LONG-HANDLED KNIFE from a sheath and holds 
    it over his head -- the wicked blade catching the crazily 
      strobing lights.  The screaming of the crowd reaches a fever 
      pitch just as he suddenly brings the knife down in a SLASHING 
    ARC --        "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/065.


      ZOE-A

      Begins to feel ill from whatever horrible thing is happening 
    on the (o.c.) stage.  She puts a hand to her mouth as she 
      takes one more look up at the leery, lurid eyes of Hecate and 
      then turns away, pushing her way back through the crowd of 
      teens, the number of dancing bodies making it hard for her to 
      escape.  The crowd presses in on her... she feels the first 
      hint of panic touching the back of her throat... she 
      struggles to get out... the noise is deafening... the lights 
      blinding... 

    ... she begins to SCREAM -- then suddenly WINKS OUT and 
      DISAPPEARS COMPLETELY from the dance floor.

      ZOE, BEN AND LACY

      React up in the balcony.

    He smiles at Zoe and she gives up her first smile in return -- 
    she has a winning smile.  Ben takes her in his arms.

                                  LACY

    He pulls her in for a kiss, but then --

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


    Zoe is sitting on top of the toilet seat, no longer dressed 
    in chic black but in a rather plain school uniform with 
       Athena Academy  stitched on the breast pocket.  Facing her 
    is a very annoyed female PREFECT holding a highly polished 
      platinum  HoloBand  blinking red and blue that she just 
      pulled off of Zoe s head.

                                  PREFECT
                    Zoe Graystone.  What a surprise.

                                  ZOE
                    Go frakyourself, Caston.*

    And as the Prefect narrows her eyes...*


    The Prefect and a contrite Zoe stand before SISTER CLARICE *
      WILLOW, late 30s, dressed in the traditional clerical robes *
    of an Athenian High Priestess, sitting at her imposing but *
      simple desk.*

                                  CLARICE*
                    That will be all, Ms. Caston.*

                                  CASTON*
                    Yes, Sister Clarice.*

      Caston obediently leaves, but not before giving Zoe a look as *
    if to say  good luck, sucker.   Once the door closes behind *
      Caston, Zoe relaxes.*

                                  ZOE*
                    I can explain.*

                                  CLARICE*
                    I doubt that very much.*

                                  ZOE*
                    But--*

                                  CLARICE*
                    I m sorry -- I wasn t clear.  I *
                    have no interestin hearing your *
                      explanations, Zoe.*
                          (then)*
                    Sit down.*

      Zoe, reluctantly sits.  Clarice looks Zoe straight in the *
      eye.  It is a deep, penetrating look.*        "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/067.


                                  CLARICE*
                    You re having second thoughts.*

                                  ZOE*
                    No -- no, I m not.*

                                  CLARICE*
                    It wasn t a question -- you re *
                    having second thoughts.  Acting *
                    out, looking for ways of getting *
                    caught, practically begging for *
                    someone to step in and stop you *
                    before --*

                                  ZOE*
                    That s not true.*

      Silence.  Zoe has trouble holding Clarice s eyes -- finally, *
    she folds.*

                                  ZOE*
                    I ask forgiveness.  *

                                  CLARICE*
                    And it is given.  With grace.*
                          (beat)*
                    Having second thoughts is perfectly *
                    natural -- especially in someone so *
                    young.  You need not be ashamed of *
                    your fear.  Your weakness is to be *
                    expected, and it too is forgiven.*

    Zoe quietly burns at the condescending implication, but says *
      nothing.*

                                  CLARICE*
                    So you find yourself at the *
                      crossroads.  You can go back or you *
                    can go forward.  Which will it be?*

      After a beat...*

                                  ZOE*
                    I m going forward, Sister.I ve *
                    never been more certain of anything *
                    in my life.*

      Clarice continues to hold her gaze -- then...*

                                  CLARICE*
                    I m sending your parents an *
                    official notice of misconduct.  I m *
                    sure that will pose additional *
                    problems for you, but it cannot be *
                    helped.*        "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/068.


    She holds out her hand.  Zoe stands and kisses it.*

                                  CLARICE*
                    Good luck to you.*

                                  ZOE*
                            (surprised)*
                     Luck ?*

                                  CLARICE*
                    Yes -- luck.  Even fate can *
                    sometimes be a victim of chance.  *

    Zoe thinks about that for a moment, then EXITS...*

                                                                            CUT TO:*


    Zoe emerges from Sister Clarice s to find Lacy pacing *
      outside, waiting for her.  She shoots a questioning look at*
    Zoe who gives nothing away but instead continues walking down *
    the hallway.  A beat and then Lacy speeds to catch up to her.*

                    How predictable.

                                  AMANDA
                    Okay.  Twomonths.

      Mother and daughter shoot daggers at one another, while Dad 
      tries to change the subject.

                    Hey -- I almost forgot.  Tomorrow s 
                    the big day, Z.  Your building.

                                  ZOE
                    Sorry.  Can t go.  
                          (to Amanda)
                    I m  grounded.       "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0614.


                                  DANIEL
                          (quickly)
                    We ll make an exception.  It s not 
                    every day you get a building named 
                    after you.

                                  ZOE
                    Oh, there s something to be excited 
                    about -- having your name plastered 
                    over the new computer science wing 
                    at Apollo University tomorrow 
                     cause your Dad donated about a 
                    billion cubits to the alumni fund --

                                  AMANDA
                    You are on thin ice already --

                                  ZOE
                    -- like I even wantto be 
                    associated with you and the filthy 
                    science that s corrupting the 
                    planets!  It s like having your 
                    name on the side of a 
                    slaughterhouse!

                                  AMANDA
                          (losing it)
                    That s enough!  You are so lucky 
                    and you have everything in the 
                    worlds you could possibly want and 
                    all you can do is run down our 
                    family and complain about society -- 
                    you have no idea what it means to 
                    build something, what it means to 
                    have discipline or to work hard for 
                    anything -- it s all been handed to 
                    you by the gods!

                                  ZOE
                    Yeah, I guess I ll just have to 
                    learn to how to marry into money.

      Amanda s hand is out and SLAPS Zoe even before she knows 
      she s doing it.  Her regret is just as swift, but it s too 
      late.  Zoe s shocked, but recovers quickly.  She faces her 
    mom evenly.

                                  ZOE
                    You re going to regret that for the 
                    rest of your life.  

      Something in the way she says it gives Amanda pause -- then 
    Zoe turns on her heel and stalks out of the kitchen.  Daniel 
      tries to step into the awkward silence and reach out to 
      Amanda.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0615.


                                  AMANDA
                    Can t believe I did that...

                                  DANIEL
                    It s okay.  She knows you didn t 
                    mean --

                                  AMANDA
                    It s not okay.  Not everything is 
                     okay  all the time, Daniel!  Some 
                    things just don t... ever become... 
                     okay. 

    She turns away from him, on the verge of angry tears and 
      Daniel can t decide whether he should hug her or leave her 
      alone.  He hesitates... then opts for the latter and EXITS.


    Zoe goes over to her desk.  She pulls out another holo-band *
    and a computer  sheet  from her desk drawer.  As she touches *
    the sheet, it lights up,revealing a series of arcane images, *
    not the least of which is the  infinity  symbol .  Zoe puts *
    on the holo-band, touches the symbols in a specific order *
      then...*

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:*


    Zoe appears in the V-club dressed in the same outfit we saw *
    her in before.  She ignores the proceedings around her and *
      heads deeper into the Club.  As Zoeheads through the Club we *
      again see only TEENS in evidence, all provocatively dressed *
    and engaged in a variety of decidedly adult activities:  a *
      girl is stripping on the bar to the delight of a crowd of *
      onlookers, a sprawling group of kids are lying on couches and *
      smoking something powerful from a large hookah, a couple of *
      boys are fighting to the cheers and taunts from their *
      friends.  But Zoe walk purposefully towards...*


      Literally HUNDREDS of VIP ROOM doors stretch down a long *
      corridor, each with its own logo and entrance decoration.  *
    Zoe stops in front of one that is decidedly plain, marked *
      only by the INFINITY SYMBOL we saw on the computer sheet.  *
    She puts her HAND on the door and it instantly OPENS for her.*


    As Zoe enters, she notices a FIGURE of a woman sitting on a *
    red velvet couch.  As she turns around, we realize it s ZOE-A *
      from the earlier scene.  She gives Zoe a tentative smile.*      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0616.

      Amanda impatiently sits behind the wheel of her sleek, 
      expensive car in the driveway, as Zoe deliberately walks down 
    the driveway with her backpack.   Amanda can see that Zoe is 
      taking her good sweet time to get down the driveway.  She 
      HONKS the horn.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0618.


    ZOE

      Smiles every so slightly, pleased at getting under her 
      mother s skin.  Again.  She makes it to the door and is about 
    to open it when her expression turns bittersweet.  She looks 
    up at the house.  Her home.  

      She s never coming back. 

      Another HONK and Zoe finally gets in the car.


      Down below, in the MLMT at the platform (where, thanks to 
      some amazing kind of technology, it is a beautiful day) we 
      meet TAMARA ADAMS, 15, and her mother, SHANNON, 30s.  They've 
      just come from a mom/daughter shopping and spa day and are 
      laden down with shopping bags.  Shannon is talking on her 
      hands-free mobile.

                                  SHANNON
                    Hey.  Just checking on your ETA 
                    tonight.

      INTERCUT WITH:


      JOSEPH ADAMS (40s) is working at his desk.  Joseph s hair is 
      already starting to go iron-grey and his entire demeanor is 
      that of someone who s already put on more miles than most men 
    his age.  There s a gravitas to Joseph, an intelligence, and 
      a strong sense of someone you wouldn t want as your enemy.

                                  JOSEPH
                    I m thinking about seven.

                                  SHANNON
                    You always say that.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Shouldn t be much later than that.

                                  SHANNON
                    The party starts at seven-thirty.

      Tamara grabs the ear clip from Shannon.

                                  TAMARA
                    Dad-- you can tbe late this time.  
                    It s his birthday-- you wanna put 
                    Willie in therapy the rest of his 
                    life?

                                  JOSEPH
                          (can t help but smile)
                    I m pretty sure I ll be outta here 
                    by seven.

                                  TAMARA
                    No, Daddy.  No.  Unacceptable.  You 
                    have to promiseyou ll be there on 
                    time.  Thenyou ll be there.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0620.


                                  JOSEPH
                     Unacceptable?   Glad I m not 
                    appearing in yourcourt.

                                  TAMARA
                    You should be.  So?  Do I hear a 
                    promise?

                                  JOSEPH
                    Alright, your honor.  I promise.  
                    Now give me back to your mother.

      Tamara hands the ear clip back to Shannon, but the connection 
    is filling with STATIC.

                                  SHANNON
                          (fritzed)
                    Hey.  We re getting on the Lev.  

                                  JOSEPH
                          (fritzed)
                    What?

                                  SHANNON
                          (fritzed)
                    Can t hear you -- Talk to you at 
                    home.

                                  JOSEPH
                          (fritzed)
                    What?  Wait a minute, I want to 
                    tell you something...

    The connection is CUT OFF and Joseph hangs up as Shannon and 
      Tamara step into...


    As Shannon and Tamara squeeze into the crowded car so does... 

      ...ZOE and BEN with LACY right behind them.  Zoe and Ben make 
    it in and hold out their hand to Lacy but she BACKS away from 
      them.  Zoe and Lacy lock eyes.  Lacy s are the size of 
      saucers.

                                  ZOE
                    It ll be okay, I promise.  They ll 
                    welcome us on Gemenon -- it s not 
                    like it is on Caprica.  We ll have 
                    a whole new family there.*

                                  LACY
                    Sorry.

      Lacy ducks out the doors just before they close and the train 
      takes off, leaving Lacy at the platform.

      INSIDE...

    Zoe and Ben manage to find a place to sit.  They stare out 
    the window at the fake scenery rolling by.  Ben s mind is 
      definitely somewhere else -- is that sweat or rain drops on 
    his forehead?

                                  ZOE
                          (more in sorrow)

                    She won t tell anyone before we re

    She takes Ben s silence as disagreement.

                    am.

    She tries to put an arm around him, but he quickly gets up 
    and stands at the window.

      ACROSS THE AISLE...

      Shannon and Tamara stand, holding on to straps.

                                  TAMARA
                    ... so anyway this little creep 
                    actually says,  She smells like a 
                    Tauron.  You can smell em a block 
                    away.        "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0622.


                                  SHANNON
                    I hope you walked away.

                                  TAMARA
                    I did.  After I kicked him in the 
                    balls.  

                                  SHANNON
                    Tamara!  You didn t!

                                  TAMARA
                    He deserved worse.

      Shannon shakes her head, but can t conceal her amusement -- 
      she s actually smiling and trying not to laugh as the Train 
      moves through the dark tunnel at close to the speed of sound.  
      It's practically a blur. 

      Inside, however, it seems as if we're moving at a normal 
      speed through a pastoral countryside -- just another 
      technical illusion provided to enhance a sense of well-being 
    and ease among the passengers.  And we see it in the faces of 
      those surrounding Zoe and Ben. 

    ZOE

    Is lost in thought for a beat.  Finally, she makes a decision 
    and pulls out of her pocket what looks like a piece of PAPER, 
    but which is actually a sophisticated computer sheet. She 
      unfolds the sheet, touches the edge and it comes to life.  
    She writes a message quickly on the sheet.  On the computer 
      page we see she s written:

      Don t live in regret, Mom.  I forgive you.

    She touches a part of the sheet and the writing VANISHES and 
    is replaced with MESSAGE SENT.  Then she folds it up, puts it 
    in her pocket.  Her mind eased, she looks up at Ben, who is 
      still standing there with his back to her.

                                  ZOE
                          (annoyed)
                    So you gonna be like this all the 
                    way to Gemenon or what?

                          (beat)
                    Ben.

    But when Ben turns around, Zoe knows instantly that something 
    is very, VERYwrong.  His eyes are bright with tears, his 
      face is pale, and there s a tremor in his voice.

                                  BEN
                    I m sorry, Zoe... but this is God s 
                    will.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0623.


                                  ZOE
                    What...?

    Ben pulls open his JACKET, to reveal EXPLOSIVES taped to his 
      chest.  Zoe s eyes widen --

                                  ZOE
                    No, Ben -- PLEASE --

                    THE ONE GOD WILL DRIVE OUT THE 
                    MANY!

    Ben presses a button and the ENTIRE MLMT CAR IS SUDDENLY 
      ENGULFED IN FLAMES! 


    We see the TRAIN spin out of control as the flames create a 
      chain reaction of EXPLOSIONSdown each car.


    The pavement quivers, shakes and eventually erupts like a *
      volcano as the LTP TRAIN bursts forth as a FIRE BALL.*

      FADE IN:


    At Caprica City Hall, a LARGE GATHERING of the FAMILIESof 
    the victims of the MLMT accident are gathered.  On the stage, 
    the MAYOR of Caprica City stands at the podium.  His face is 
      projected on a large screen behind him.  This is not a 
      friendly crowd -- their pain is still fresh and they give him 
      a jaundiced, skeptical look.

      SUPER:              TWO WEEKS LATER

                                  MAYOR
                    In this senseless tragedy, it s 
                    important for you to know that the 
                    government of Caprica takes matters 
                    of terrorism seriously and that 
                    this case will be pursued until 
                    justice is served.  

      JOSEPH ADAMS

    Is in the crowd.  Most people here are wearing BLACK 
      ARMBANDS, but he s wearing BLACK GLOVES instead.  His 
      expression is serious, but he s not really listening as the 
      Mayor hands over the podium to another MAN.

                                  MAYOR
                    Agent Duram?

      Agent JORDAN DURAM, 40s, a suit draped around a thin steel 
      wire of a man, steps up to the podium.  There s a laser-like 
      intensity to Duram, as well as a vast reservoir of patience, 
    the kind of man who is perfectly capable of following a case 
    for years if necessary.*

                                  DURAM*
                    On behalf of the President, let me *
                    express your government s deepest *
                    sympathy.  This is what we know: a *
                    group known as  Soldiers of the *
                    One  claimed responsibility.*

      A hush from the crowd.  They ve clearly heard about this *
      organization.*

                    Ten years to be precise.  We still *
                    have a lotto sift through but *
                    everything points to their *

                                  DURAM*
                    Not that we know of.  But as we *
                    speak, we are gathering evidence...*

      Joseph s mind isn t really here.

    His daughter Tamara and wife Shannon, leaving what we ll come 
    to know as their high-rise APARTMENT for the last time.

      RESUME SCENE

      Duram continues on stage, a power-point like graphic now on 
    the screen behind him, illustrating the organization of the 
       Solders of the One group.  Its symbol is an INFINITY LOOP.*

                                  DURAM
                    As I m sure you all know, the *
                       S.T.O. espouses a monotheistic *
                    religious philosophy advocating the 
                    worship of a single, all-knowing, 
                    all powerful God whose mission is 
                    to quote,  drive out the many *
                    gods, end quote.*

      Joseph gets up and WALKS OUTof the room.


      This operating room is close enough to our own to recognize 
    it as such but it is full of esoteric technological 
      instruments and robotic arms surrounding the Patient.  That s 
      when we realize the Patient is the only one in the room.


    And there is Dr. Amanda Graystone, surrounded by NURSESand 
      TECHNICIANS as she guides a probe through an exact 
      HOLOGRAPHIC replica of the Patient in the other room only 
      without skin, exposing the inner organs.

      Amanda stretches her neck -- she s not wearing a mask or 
      operating gown, but the tension and stress in the control 
      room is just as intense.  She looks at a MONITOR:  Elapsed 
      Time:  5 hrs.35 min. 45 secs...

      Amanda yelling at Zoe.

                                  AMANDA
                    ... all you can do is run down our 
                    family and complain about society -- 
                    you have no idea what it means to 
                    build something, what it means to 
                    have...

      RESUME SCENE

      Amanda focussing back on the monitors before her.  She checks 
      everything, then renders her verdict:

                                  AMANDA
                    Okay, that s that.

    As Amanda comes out of the OR Control Room, a nurse hands her

      Amanda stops, almost stumbles with surprise -- and not a 
      pleasant one either.

      Amanda hangs up but there s something in her eyes that tells 
    us she wishes she hadn t.

                    exactly.  I m not that into *
                    computers, she just seemed... *
                    gifted that way.*

      Clarice gets up, walks around the room, tries to be casual.*

                                  CLARICE*
                    I was thinking that if you knew of *
                    any particular work Zoe was *
                    doing... any work you could find... *
                    that perhaps it would be a way for *
                    you to... reconnect with her.  Find *
                    comfort in discovering her in a *
                    different way...*

      Which gives Lacy an idea.*

                    I m going to be late for dinner.  I *
                    should be going.  Thank you for... *
                    caring.  This really helped..*

                    I m glad.  You are a true daughter *
                    of Athena, Lacy.  You must never *
                    forget that.*

      Lacy kisses her hand then flies out the door.  The second *
      she s gone, the smile vanishes from Clarice s face.*      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0632.



      Amanda is standing in the doorway of her daughter s room, 
      arms crossed, as she peers inside.  All of Zoe s things are 
      still there -- all the detritus of a teenage life cut short 
    are on garish display, all of them waiting to be picked up 
    and examined.  But Amanda won t cross over the threshold, 
      won t actually go inside.

      Amanda JUMPSat the sound of the butler robot.  She sets her 
      jaw.

                    Yes?


      Amanda ENTERS the foyer just behind Serge, to see Lacy 
      standing there.*

                    Hi.

    An awkward beat.  Lacy can t seem to meet her eyes.

                                  AMANDA
                    Are you all right?

                                  LACY
                    Yeah.  I, uh... I know this is 
                    going to sound kinda... kinda, you 
                    know --  weird.   But I was, um... 
                    kinda wondering if I could just... 
                    sit in her room for... a while?

      Amanda is taken off-guard, acquiesces almost out of some 
      misplaced sense of guilt.

                                  AMANDA
                    Of course.*

    The Servant robot comes up to Lacy.*

                    Ready. 

                                  AMANDA
                    Allow entry -- Lacy Rand.

      A SCANNING beam emanatesfrom Serge and envelopes Lacy and *
      then shuts down.*

                                  SERGE
                    Welcome, Lacy Rand.

                                  LACY
                    Thank you.

      Lacy heads up the stairs.  Amanda makes a sudden, impulsive 
      decision.

                                  AMANDA
                          (to Serge)
                    I m going out.  Tell Daniel I won t 
                    be home for dinner.

      Amanda heads for the door.

                                  SERGE
                    Yes, Doctor.


    In a dark corner of a dark restaurant, Tomas Vergis sits in a 
      booth, nursing a drink and perusing a menu.  Amandasuddenly 
      sits down next to him without preamble and puts a hand to her 
      forehead as if to hide her face from -- herself.

                                  AMANDA
                    I m only staying half an hour.

                                  VERGIS
                    Gods you look great, Mandy.  Can t 
                    tell you how glad I am you changed 
                    your--

                          (without looking at him)
                    Shut up and order me a drink.

      He s smart enough to shut up.  A small smile crosses his lips 
    as he flags down a waiter...*


      Lacy sitting in the same room looking very small on the bed 
    as she remembers her now dead friend and happier times.  Her 
      eyes roam over the artifacts of a young girl s life -- 
      finally landing on the DESK.*

      Lacy gets off the bed and goes over to the desk and sits 
      down.  She hesitates for a moment, then reaches into the 
      drawer and pulls out a COMPUTER SHEET.  She touches the side 
    and TURNS it on.*

      Where Lacy is entering in the same complex equations and 
      strings into the computer sheet on the desk.  The INFINITY 
      SYMBOL appears.  Lacy takes deep breath, then puts on her 
      holoband and TOUCHES the symbol on the page --      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0636.



      Lacy, now wearing the same little black dress we saw earlier, 
      stands in one of the enormous bars of the sprawling V-Club *
      where it s business as usual but Lacy ignores all of it.  A *
    HOT BOY tries to approach her at one point and she just PUTS 
    UP A HAND and he s REBUFFED as if by an invisible WALL.  He 
      makes an obscene, silent gesture at her, but she continues 
      on...


      Lacy standsin front of door marked with the INFINITY SYMBOL.*

      Lacy puts her HAND on the door and it instantly OPENS for 
      her.  She hesitates for a moment, then goes inside...


      Lacy ENTERS and looks around the plush furnishings in this 
      opulent den and reacts to something she sees o.c.*

      REVEAL:

      A FIGURE IN SILHOUETTE...*

                                  FIGURE*
                    Is that you, Lacy?*

      Tears come unbidden to her eyes and she puts a hand to her *
      mouth. *

                                  LACY*
                    Yes.  It s me.*

    And with that,the figure steps out into the light, revealing *
      Zoe s Avatar (ZOE-A),the left side of her body covered in *
      BLOOD.*

      A few minutes later.  Zoe-A is sitting on the couch as Lacy *

                    me to feelwhat she felt -- in real *

                    exactly, but... somethinghappened.  *

      Zoe-A reacts as if she was slapped.  She steps away from Lacy 
      with tears bright in her eyes.  Her lower lip betrays a 
      slight tremor.*

    She starts to cry and Lacy finds herself walking across the 
      room and putting her arms around Zoe-A before she even 
      realizes what she s doingand as she does, miraculously all *
    of the bloodstains on Zoe-A s clothes DISAPPEAR.*


      Daniel is home and walking through the quiet, dark hallway 
      toward his bedroom.  He s about to go inside when he notices--

      Coming from beneath Zoe s door down the Hall.  Why s the 
      light on in Zoe s room?He heads down the hallway, quietly 
      OPENS the door --


      Daniel ENTERS to see Lacy, her HoloBand on, with her arms 
      around empty space in front of her.

      Lacy holding Zoe-A in her arms.

                                  LACY
                    Somehow... I promise.


      Daniel approaches her.

                                  DANIEL
                    Lacy?


      Lacy lets go of Zoe-A and quickly whips around...


      Lacy whips around, pulls off her HoloBand, then focusses on 
      Daniel; her face the very definition of guilt.

                                  LACY
                    Dr. Graystone!

                                  DANIEL
                    I didn t know you were here.  What 
                    are you doing?      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0641.


                                  LACY
                    Nothing.  I--uh... just... I gotta 
                    go--

    She bolts out of the room, past Daniel.  He follows her out 
      into the Hallway in puzzlement.

                                  DANIEL
                    Lacy, wait -- 

    But Lacy is down the stairs and GONE.  He looks after her for 
      a beat and then Daniel goes back into Zoe s bedroom.  He 
      looks around.  This is the first time he s been in here since 
    the accident.  

      Daniel looks over at Zoe s desk and sees the Computer Sheet. 
      Something about it spikes his curiosity.  He looks down at 
    the esoteric code on the screen.  Odd.  As he picks up the 
      Computer sheet...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Joseph, still wearing his armband, is standing with the 
      DEFENDANT, whose face is covered in face tattoos; a sign that 
    he is a member of the Tauron Ha la tha(e.g. theMafia).  
      They are in front of the JUDGE in a small, working courtroom 
      which is still more technologically advanced than anything we 
      could imagine.  The Defendant nervously looks over at Joseph, 
    who nods.

                                  DEFENDANT
                          (accent)
                    Not guilty, your Honor.

    The Judge makes eye contact with Joseph for a beat.  Joseph 
      remains stoic, expressionless... except he purposefully 
      CLOSES his eyes and opens them again.  The Judge nods -- 
      clearly a sign has been given.  The Judge bangs his gavel.

                                  JUDGE
                    Clerk will set a date for trial 
                    within the month.  Bail will be set 
                    at ten thousand cubits.

    The PROSECUTOR jumps up in protest.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0642.


                                  PROSECUTOR
                    Your Honor, the Defendant is a 
                    known member of the Ha la tha. 
                    There is a serious flight risk to 
                    Tauron.  The State strongly  
                    recommends that bail be denied.

                                  JUDGE
                    I thank the State for its input.  
                    Ruling stands.

    The Judge hits the gavel.

    The Defendant offers thanks to Joseph but he turns to leave 
    the court room without even looking at the Defendant.  As 
      Joseph walks out, he sees his brother SAM (40s), big and 
      burly, standing at the door.  Sam is also wearing BLACK *
      GLOVESjust like his brother.  They walk out together into...*


    As they walk, Sam hands Joseph a thin envelope.

                                  SAM
                    Ten thousand cubits for the bail.

    He hands Joseph another thin envelope.

                                  SAM
                    And twenty thousand for His Honor.

      Without comment, Joseph takes the two envelopes and puts them 
    in his breast pocket.  They walk for a beat.  Then...

                                  SAM
                    The Guatrauis grateful for the 
                    work you have done for him.  All 
                    the work.  So much so that he s 
                    pledged to help us find the 
                    frakking terrorist scum that killed 
                    Shannon and Tamara.

                                  JOSEPH
                    That won t be necessary.  

                                  SAM
                    Blood for blood.  It s the Tauron 
                    way.

                                  JOSEPH
                    It s not myway.  We're on Caprica 
                    now, brother.

                                  SAM
                    Caprica.  What has this frakking 
                    planet ever done for us?      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0643.


                                  JOSEPH
                          (ignoring him)
                    I ve got a deposition in--

    Sam grabs his brother by the shoulder and stops him.

                                  SAM
                          (angry)
                    Do you feel nothing?

                                  JOSEPH
                          (low)
                    Yes.  I feel like my brother, who I 
                    love and respect, needs to let me 
                    grieve in my own way.  

    The words cut through Sam.  He loves him, doesn t want to 
      push Joseph to places he can t or won t go.

                                  SAM
                    One day, little Brother, you will 
                    wake up to the fact that the world 
                    only understands an iron fist 
                    shoved in its face.  Until that 
                    day, I will respect your wishes... 
                    but I will also pray to the gods 
                    for swift and terrible vengeance to 
                    come to the men who ve torn out our 
                    hearts.

                                  JOSEPH
                    There are no gods, Sam.

                                  SAM
                    Then all the more important we make 
                    our own justice.

    Sam disengages from Joseph and walks away.  Off Joseph, 
      thinking about Sam s words...


      Standing in the center of this large, all-white arena is a...

      ...CYLON CENTURION... or so we think at first glance.  As we 
    get closer, we realize it is a very different model than 
      we ve seen but it has the tell-tale scanning beam where its

      They watch as down below, other TECHNICIANS and MANAGERS 
      prepare a test on the basic robot we ll now refer to as U-87.  
      Daniel is distracted throughout.

      Cyrus isn t willing to push Daniel or challenge him, but he 
      does need to bring certain things to his attention.

                                  CYRUS
                    I had a conversation with Secretary 
                    of Defense Chambers this morning.
                          (beat)
                      President s getting a lot of heat.   
                    Media s playing up the fact that 
                    we re five years behind schedule 
                    and half a billion cubits over 
                    budget.  He s starting to get a lot 
                    pressure to yank the robot soldier 
                    contract from us and go off-world 
                    with it.
                          (beat)
                    They re talking about going to 
                    Vergis.

      Daniel doesn t answer, continues to watch as down below, a 
      TECHNICIAN actives a control station and...

      A PANEL

    In the seamless wall OPENSand out rolls a ROBOTlike Serge, 
    the robot servant we met at Daniel s estate.  The panel 
      closes and the robot starts rolling around right into the 
      scanning beam of the U-87.  

      Suddenly the U-87 becomes animated and it extends its arm 
      forward.  Much like its descendents will one day do, the arm 
      rapidly reassembles itself into a weapon and the U-87 begins 
    to move (albeit haltingly) towards the Serge-robot who in 
      turn, realizing it s being stalked, starts taking off for 
      another part of the arena.  

      DANIEL & CYRUS

      Watch with mounting tension as the U-87 gains on the Serge...        "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0645.


    -- When it s in range, the U-87 begins to FIRE rounds.

    -- Which are PAINTBALLS.

    -- Not a single one hits the mark.  The Serge robot is clean 
    as a whistle.  

    -- The U-87 starts to get twitchy and the next thing you know 
      it s shooting paintballs up AT THE OBSERVATION WINDOW.  

      Cyrus turns to Daniel with a tense expression. 

                                  DANIEL
                    It s still not ready.  I ll be out 
                    for the rest of the day.  No calls.

      Cyrus watches as Daniel heads out the door.


      Vergis sips coffee in his bathrobe as Amanda exits the

      much as a sideways glance, she begins to put her clothes on.

      Zoe s Computer Sheet is on the worktable with a lot of other 
      THINGS CLIPPED ONTO IT.  This place is beyond a state-of-the-
    art technological wonderland.  Daniel is struggling to break 
    the codes that we saw Lacy punch in to Zoe s computer. 

    In front of him is a polished chrome case with his initials 
      engraved into it and the following inscription:

                                             HoloBand 
                                  In Acknowledgement 
                                            of the 
                                One Millionth Unit Sold

    He opens the case and there is Daniel s own personal model of 
    the HoloBand (his company invented it).  He activates one of 
    the MONITORS, runs a physical LEAD from the Band to the 
      Computer.

      Daniel places his personal HoloBand onto his forehead.  He 
      checks a few of the many monitors he has wired into Zoe s 
      computer and then enters his best guess as to the code.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Daniel is now in the virtual nightclub, his own personal 
      avatar looking much like his living self, and drawing stares 
      among the teenaged denizens of this world.  The patrons 
      reject his attempts at communication and he's given the 
      virtual equivalent of talk to the hand as more and more teen 
      avatars  silence  Daniel and refuse access.  Others digitally 
      SHADE their faces, effectively hiding their identities.

      Daniel is amazed by it  - it's an underground kind of thing, 
      something he's heard about, but never paid attention to.

    He watches the teen patrons as they take drugs, drink, have 
      public sex on the couches.

                                  DANIEL
                    This isn t your kind of place

                    I have it on very good authority 
                    that Vergis is going to tell 
                    Chambers that he hasa MCP.  And it 
                    works -- don t ask me how.  But if 
                    they ve got a viable, independent 
                    artificial brain, then the only 
                    thing they re missing is a robotic 
                    body.  Put the two together and 
                    you ve got a completely autonomous 
                    robot -- a sentient, intelligent 
                    machine.  It ll be the breakthrough

      Cyrus looks at him like he just asked if he s ever heard of

                    Keep me posted on Vergis.

      Daniel signs off and the screen goes blank leaving Daniel to 
      stare down at the HoloBand in his hand.  He takes a beat, 
      then puts it back on his head and touches the computer sheet-- 


    -- and finds himself back in the virtual Nightclub, being 
      systematically ignored by the patrons.  He moves through the 
      scene, unable to reconcile the image of his daughter with 
      someone who would be coming here regularly.

    But the trance music and the debauchery is getting to him, 
    and he's about to leave when he sees --      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0650.


      ZOE-A

      Sitting at the bar and talking to SOMEONE O.C. She feels eyes 
    on her and turns to see Daniel.  He s staring at her with 
      shock and pain etched into every inch of his face.  Zoe-A 
      bolts up from the barstool and into the crowd.

                                  DANIEL
                    Zoe?  ZOE!!

      Daniel pursues, pushing and clawing his way through the press 
    of humanity.  He loses sight of her for a moment -- then sees 
    her disappearing into the VIP ROOMwith the INFINITY SYMBOL 
    on it.  

    The door slams closed, but Daniel races toward it, determined 
    to break it down if necessary.  He grabs the doorknob -- 

      WHAM!!!!!!!!!!  

      Everything goes WHITE and a loud SCREECHING sound blasts at 
      Daniel, causing him to fall backwards...

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Daniel falls backwards on to the floor and scrambles to get 
    the HoloBand off.  He winces with pain, rubbing his temples.  
    He gets up and looks at the Computer screen.

                                  DANIEL

      Lacy comes down the stairs to see Clarice sitting on the 
      couch.

                                  LACY
                    Sister Clarice.

      Clarice smiles warmly and Lacy smiles back.

                                  CLARICE
                    Lacy, I d like you to meet Agent 
                    Duram.

    And that s when Lacy (and we) notice Agent Duram in the room, 
    he smiles in typical fashion to men of his profession.

                                  DURAM
                    Hello, Ms. Rand.

      A lump forms in Lacy s throat and travels down to the pit of 
    her stomach.

                                  CLARICE
                    Agent Duram has a few questions to 
                    ask.  I know this is a traumatic 
                    time for you and all your fellow 
                    students, so I thought it best if I 
                    accompany him on his interviews.

                                  DURAM
                    Which I greatly appreciate.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0653.


      Lacy sits on the couch as Agent Duram pulls a chair up close 
    to her in a sort of scary-friendly manner...

                                  DURAM
                    I understand you were friends with 
                    Ben Stark.

                                  LACY
                          (trying to calm down)
                    Sure.  I knew Ben.

                                  DURAM
                    We have evidence to suggest he was 
                    involved in the attack on the Lev.

      Which is the last thing she was expecting to hear.  Her 
      surprise and disbelief have the ring of truth to them.

                                  LACY
                      That s...crazy.*

                                  CLARICE
                    I have to agree with Lacy.  It s an 
                    absurd allegation, Mr. Duram.

                                  DURAM
                    I m afraid we have forensic 
                    evidence linking him to the 
                    bombing.  
                          (to Lacy)
                    Were you aware of his involvement 
                    with the Soldiers Of The One?*

      Lacy tries not to react, but Duram notes her tense slightly.

                                  CLARICE
                          (offended)
                    Ben Stark was a good and decent *
                    boy.  He would never be involved 
                    with some kind of--ofterrorist
                      organization.

                                  DURAM
                          (ignoring Clarice)
                    Lacy, did you knowifBen was *
                    involved?*

      Lacy tries to keep her voice calm and steady.

                                  LACY
                    No.  And I don t believe it.

                                  DURAM
                    What about Zoe Graystone?  Were you 
                    aware that shewas in "Soldiers of *
                    the One"as well?*      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0654.


                                  LACY*
                    What about her?*

                                  DURAM*
                    Do you know if she was involved *
                    too?*

      Lacy sits back on the couch and crosses her arms, clearly at 
    the end of her cooperation.  Duram watches her closely and 
      Lacy tries very hard not to flinch.*

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Lacy steps back from the window.  She can barely breathe.

    Off Lacy, feeling like she s drowning...

      FADE IN:


      Serge opens the door to see a nervous Lacy standing there.

                                  SERGE
                    Welcome, Lacy Rand.

                                  LACY
                    May I come in?

                    Thanks.

    She tentatively enters.  Serge closes the door behind her.

                                  LACY
                    I m going up to Zoe s bedroom...

                                  SERGE
                    As you wish.

      Lacy heads up the stairs.


      Lacy enters the bedroom and starts looking through Zoe s desk 
    for the Computer Sheet which isn t there.

                                  DANIEL (O.S.)
                    Looking for this?*

      Lacy jumps out of her skin and turns around to see a bleary-
      eyed Daniel in the doorway, holding the Computer Sheet.  He 
      looks like hell and he knows it.

                                  DANIEL
                    You ll pardon the way I look.  I ve 
                    been up all night trying to... 
                    crack one of the better security 
                    codes I ve ever run up against.
                          (beat)
                    I ve been to the V-Club.

                                  LACY
                    I--Idon t know what you re talking 
                    about...        "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0657.


                                  DANIEL
                    And I ve seenher, Lacy.

      Lacy s eyes go wide.  

                                  DANIEL
                    I saw her having a drink at a 
                    bar... then I saw her go into a 
                    room with a symbol on the door --

    He holds up the computer sheet, which displays the INFINITY 
      SYMBOL.

                                  DANIEL
                    This symbol.  It s the one 
                      mathematicians use for infinity...*
                          (beat)
                    Now, I don t know what any of this 
                    means, or how s it possible there s 
                    a digital version of my daughter 
                    running around a virtual nightclub -
                    - but I have a feeling you do.

                                  LACY
                    I m sorry, but I really don t know 
                    what you re talking about, Doctor 
                    Graystone.

    She moves to leave, but he takes a small step and blocks the 
      door -- not much of a physical threat, but it s there.  Lacy 
      stops cold.

                                  DANIEL
                    I want to see her, Lacy.  Whoever --
                      whatevershe is -- I needto see 
                    her.

      Daniel can see Lacy s scared, conflicted.  He struggles to 
      hold on emotionally -- he s a bit strung-out, all nerve-
      endings and jagged edges.  He tries to take the threat out of 
    his voice.

                                  DANIEL
                    You know... when Zoe was little, 
                    she was all ponies and dress-up 
                    games and pink shoes with sparkly
                    toes.  Funny thing is, I still 
                    think about her like that.  Guess I 
                    never bothered to look past that as 
                    she grew up. 
                          (beat)
                    So I guess I kept seeing someone 
                    who wasn t there anymore.   Cause 
                    you know what -- I ve been going 
                    through that closet and... 
                                  (MORE)      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0658.

                                  DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    there are five pairs of black 
                    stilettos in that closet Lacy, and 
                    not one single pair of pink shoes.
                          (beat)
                    There s also a whole lot of 
                    religious books I don t understand 
                    and a lot of computer equipment I 
                    dounderstand -- I didn t know she 
                    was interested in computers.  
                    Thought she hated computers 
                    because... well, because Iliked 
                    them.

      Lacy hears the heartbreak in that last statement.  She begins 
    to soften and Daniel can see it in her eyes.  His voice 
      becomes softer yet, pleading with this girl to help him.

                                  DANIEL
                    Who s the woman in the V-Club, 
                    Lacy?  I know she s not Zoe -- my *
                    little girl s dead.  But she s 
                    connected to Zoe, isn t she?  She s 
                    a clue.  A clue to something about 
                    Zoe... something else I never knew.  
                    Maybe it s going to tell me 
                    something I shouldn t know.  Maybe 
                    it s something... awful.  But it s 
                    the truth.  And I d really like to 
                    see the truth instead of looking 
                    for... pink shoes.

      Lacy and he lock eyes and she can t help but be moved by the

      nods...


      RUTH (60s), Joseph s mother-in-law, packs lunch for William.  
      Joseph comes in for coffee.

                                  RUTH
                    William was up all night.  Again.

                                  JOSEPH
                    I know.   I m not sure what to do.

                                  RUTH
                    Let him experience his roots.  Take 
                    him home to Tauron.  

                                  JOSEPH
                    William was born on Caprica.  This 
                    ishis home.  

      William enters, looks at them both with expressionless eyes.  
      Then, breaking the tension, Ruth hands William his lunch box.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0659.


                                  RUTH
                    There s an extra slice of the 
                    cherry cake you liked so much.

    She kisses William on the forehead.

                                  WILLIAM
                    Thanks, Tsattie.  Are you taking me 
                    to school?

      Before Ruth can answer...

                                  JOSEPH
                    It s on my way to work, Willie.

                                  WILLIAM
                          (disappointed)
                    Okay.


      Vergis is seated in the First Class section of this well-
      appointed transport ship.  He makes a call on his phone.


      Amanda, sitting in her office, her phone ringing.  She can 
    see via the display that it s Vergis calling.  She stares at 
    the phone, but does not pick it up.


      Vergis, disappointed, closes his phone.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.)
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to 
                    Flight 1232, destination Mars City 
                    on the planet of Tauron.  Our 
                    flight time is approximately thirty-
                    six hours and during that time...

      Vergis lays back in his seat and closes his eyes.


      Amanda sitting where we left her, hereyes also closed.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.  Dr. Graystone?

                                  AMANDA
                    Yes.

    She opens her eyes to see AGENT DURAM in the doorway.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0660.


                                  DURAM
                          (showing his ID)
                    Agent Duram, Global Defense 
                      Department.  I wonder if you have a 
                    few minutes.

                                  AMANDA
                    For what?

                                  DURAM
                    As you probably know, I m 
                      investigating the attack on the 
                    MLMT train.

                                  AMANDA
                    Should I know that?  I ve been 
                    avoiding the news lately.

                                  DURAM
                    Completely understandable.  I m not 
                    sure how I d react if I lost 
                    someone in such tragic 
                      circumstances.

                                  AMANDA
                    I doubt it s something normal human 
                    beings think much about... until it 
                    happens to them.

                                  DURAM
                    I suppose you re right.

                                  AMANDA
                    But you obviously didn t come here 
                    for an existential dialectic.  What 
                    is it you wanted to ask, Agent...?

                                  DURAM
                    Duram.  It s about your daughter, 
                    Zoe.  Was there anything in her 
                    behavior before the incident that 
                    seemed... unusual?

                                  AMANDA
                    She was angry, defiant, 
                      unreasonable, vulgar and rude.  
                    Just your... typical sixteen year 
                    old girl.

                                  DURAM
                    And how would you describe her 
                    circle of friends?  Was there an 
                      anti-social aspect to--      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0661.


                                  AMANDA
                    Please do me the courtesy of 
                    cutting to the chase, Agent Duram.

      After a beat...

                                  DURAM
                    We have evidence to positively link 
                    your daughter to the bombers.

      Amanda doesn t know what she was expecting to hear, but it 
      certainly wasn t that.

                                  AMANDA
                    I m sorry.  You think... you think 
                    she knewone of the terrorists?

                                  DURAM
                    Dr. Graystone... we think that Zoe 
                    might have beenone of the 
                      terrorists.

      Amanda stares for a beat, then smiles, almost laughs.

                                  AMANDA
                          (almost laughing)
                    My daughter didn t have a political 
                    bone in her body.  Her biggest 
                    concerns in life were partying with 
                    her friends and finding new and 
                    creative ways to drive her parents 
                    insane.

                                  DURAM
                    I understand how upsetting this 
                    must be.

      Duram meets her eyes calmly for a beat and then pulls out a 
      SHEET OF PAPERwhich he hands it over to her.

                                  DURAM
                    We think it was sent from your 
                    daughter s computer sheet.

      Amanda looks down at the message and sees:

      Don t live in regret, Mom.  I forgive you.

    All the blood drains from Amanda s face.

                                  DURAM
                    The message was transmitted just 
                    before the explosion but never 
                    uplinkedto the server.   It took a 
                    fair amount of digital forensics to 
                      reconstruct it.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0662.


      Amanda just stares at the sheet, trying desperately to hold 
      back a flood of emotion. 

                                  AMANDA
                    Get out.

                                  DURAM
                    Sounds like a last message to me... 
                    like someone who knows the end is 
                    near and wants to make amends.

                                  AMANDA
                    GET OUT!

                                  DURAM
                    Thank you for your time, Doctor.

    He leaves.  A beat and then Amanda suddenly takes in a gasp 
    of shock and fear -- is that even remotely possible?Then 
    she puts a hand to her mouth and completely loses it.


      Lacy AND Daniel walk though the V-Club. 

                                  DANIEL
                    What goes on here?

                                  LACY
                    Pretty much anything.   No Limits  -
                    - that s the motto.

      They walk back the ENTRANCE to the Dance Floor, where the 
      echoing chants and trance music can be heard pulsing from 
      within.  Daniel pushes OPENthe door and sees a massive crowd 
      again watching Hecate rise up over the distant stage.

                                  DANIEL
                    And this?

                                  LACY
                    Human sacrifice.  

                                  DANIEL
                    What?

                                  LACY
                    Virgins.  They offer them to *
                    Hecate, goddess of the underworld.

      Daniel glimpses the women on the stage and the Masked Man 
      wielding the knife and then CLOSESthe door with a shudder.

                                  DANIEL
                    My company created the HoloBand.  
                    This isn t exactly what we had in 
                    mind.

    She throws him a jaundiced look.

                                  LACY
                    Yeah, right.  The porn sites were 
                    first ones to license the 
                    technology -- everyone knows that.

      Daniel looks at her in surprise -- in this virtual world, 
      Lacy not only looks more adult, her language and attitude are 
      more adult, more assertive as well.

                                  DANIEL
                    That s different -- that s for 
                    adults.  

                                  LACY
                    Zoe was right -- you can 
                      rationalize anything.

                                  DANIEL
                          (stung)
                    I don t have to defend myself to 
                    you.  We didn t design the 
                    holobandsfor this.*

                    Where there s a will...*

      Lacy heads off again and Daniel follows her.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0665.


                                  DANIEL
                    So what -- you and Zoe... came 
                    here?  For... for sex?

                                  LACY
                          (casual)
                    At first.  We used to go to the 
                    group sex rooms like everyone else.

      Daniel looks like he s going to be sick.

                                  LACY
                    But after Ben showed us the way... 
                    showed us  The Way ... all that *
                    changed.  We saw this for what it 
                    was -- a temple to sin.

                                  DANIEL
                     The Way? *

      They arrive at the VIP Room with the Infinity Symbol.  Lacy 
      gives him a very direct, very confident look and speaks with 
    the self-confidence of a true believer.

                                  LACY
                    There is good and there is evil in 
                    the world.  There is a right and 
                    there is a wrong.  But only through 
                    the one trueand singularGod can *
                    you know the difference.  Zoe knew.  
                    Because Zoe knew God.  And God 
                    touched her heart and gave her the 
                    ability to create... life itself.  

      Lacy reaches out and OPENS the door...


    As Daniel and Lacy ENTER, Zoe-A gets up from the couch and 
      smiles... until she notices Daniel standing in the doorway, 
      shock and disbelief written on his features.  Zoe-A is upset 
    at the sight of him.

                                  ZOE-A
                    Oh, my God!
                          (to Lacy)
                    Why dyou bring him here?*

                                  LACY
                    He needs you, Zo.  

      Zoe-A finally turns back to Daniel, who, for his part, is 
      rooted to the spot, unable or unwilling to step farther into 
    the room as he stares at the ghost of his daughter.        "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0666.


                                  ZOE-A
                    Hi, Daddy...

    The words hit Daniel with almost physical force, he cannot 
      speak.

                                  ZOE-A
                    I thought that was you in the club 
                    yesterday... thought I got away 
                    before you saw me...
                          (tries to joke)
                    ... guess I wouldn t make a very 
                    good spy.

      Daniel finally finds his voice, taking refuge in science.

                                  DANIEL
                    You re an Avatar.  A virtual

                    I m a little more than that.  A lot 
                    more, actually.

                    Yes, I know.  And I m sorry about *

                    So what is this, really?  Did Zoe 
                    hack some kind of rudimentary 
                    emulation software or something?

      Lacy doesn t answer, but Zoe-A is quick with an answer.

                                  ZOE-A
                    She told me it was a combination of 
                    hacks and some of her own codes.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0667.

                            (dismissive)
                    Okay, that s enough.
                          (to Lacy)
                    What was the purpose of this thing?

                                  ZOE-A
                    I m not a thing.*

                    I m not going to argue with a 
                    digital image.

      He s using his  parental  voice and it automatically gets Zoe-
    A s hackles up.  Her eyes flash and her jaw tightens.

                    The human brain contains roughly 
                    300 megabytes of information.  Not 
                    much when you get right down to it.  
                    The question isn t how to store it, 
                    it s how to access it.  You can t

                      isavailable in other databases.

      Although he s refusing to look at her directly, Daniel finds 
      that he s starting to actually listen to her despite himself.

      Daniel finally looks over and stares at Zoe-A -- is this
      really the Zoe he never knew?


      Daniel is marvelling at Zoe-A, transfixed by her.

                    Yeah, I remember that -- you put me 
                    up on your shoulders so I could see 
                    the band as it marched by, but we 
                    were standing under a lamp-post...

                    ... and I smackedmy head so hard I 
                    saw stars.

                                  DANIEL
                    Took you to the emergency room.

      Daniel is lost in the memory for a moment, then pulls out of 
    it.

                                  DANIEL
                    She could ve programmed the memory 
                    into you... but it s such a minor

                    That s what she told me.

                                  DANIEL
                    But... a person... is more than a 
                    bunch of... data.  You might be a 
                    good imitation -- might be a very

                    just... an imitation.  A copy.

                    I don t feellike a copy.  Daddy.

      Daniel looks at her for moment... then makes a fateful 
      decision...

    Now it s Zoe-A s turn to be drawn despite her own best 
      intentions and her own better judgement.  She steps forward, 
      allows Daniel to put his arms around her...

    We see Daniel and Lacy seated on the bed with their HoloBands
    on, eyes closed.  But what we focus on is Daniel s HAND as it 
      moves to a small DEVICE he s attached to the computer.  His 
      fingers reach for a keypad on the device which he deftly 
      touchesand...

      WHAM!!! A RED glow forms around Zoe-A and Daniel in their 
      embrace.  Zoe-A struggles to detach itself from Daniel but 
      cannot.  Then suddenly she begins to deconstruct, as if the 
      outer layer was being peeled off and then there s only a

      A beat more and then Daniel lets go.  Zoe-A is immediately 
      restored to its former shape.

    But Daniel suddenly DISAPPEARS from the room.  A beat and 
      then Lacy DISAPPEARS too.

      Daniel is in the middle of pulling off Lacy s HoloBand.  She 
      opens her eyes in surprise and horror.

                    What have you done, Dr. Graystone?

      FADE IN:


      BLAM!A Pyramid ball slams into the goal and the crowd goes 
      wild.  We now see what pre-war Pyramid Ball looked like at 
    the height of its popularity.  A survey of the crowd shows 
      them to be every thing you d expect of rabid fans; many 
      decked out in team colors, including painted faces.  Flags 
    are waving.  It s big, it s huge, it s Pyramid!  

    We scan the scoreboard (holographically projected above the 
      players) and we see that the Bucks are creaming the Bay City 
      Salamanders.  Find in all of this chaos...

      DANIEL, JOSEPH and WILLIAM sitting in courtsideseats, the 
      players blurring back and forth right in their faces.  Joseph 
      looks down at William, and for the first time sees some life 
    in his son as William s eyes follow the action like a hawk.  
      Joseph shouts to Daniel over the noise...

                          (to William)
                    What do you think so far, William?

                                  WILLIAM
                          (not taking his eyes off 
                          the game)
                    I think Jenkins better get a solid 
                    grip on the ball before he tries 
                    anymore of those spinshots.

      Joseph, a little surprised, shrugs as if to say to Daniel 
       who knew?   Daniel smiles.

                                  DANIEL
                    I ve been telling the Coach that 
                    all season -- not that she listens.

      William doesn t really react.  Daniel gestures to an 
      ATTENDANT who quickly walks over.  Daniel whispers in his 
      ear.  The Attendant nods and then stands behind William.

                                  DANIEL

                    just ask Sean, okay?

      William nods, clearly enraptured by the game.


      A plush, well-appointed clubhouse.  Tastefully framed signed 
      jerseys of all the great Pyramid players in history line the 
      walls.  FIND Daniel and Joseph at the bar -- a robotic 
      bartender has just placed two drinks in front of them.

                    Easy.  And you?  How are you 
                    holding up?

                    chance to be with your daughter 
                    again?

      Joseph s taken completely aback and Daniel sees Joseph 
      struggling.

                                  DANIEL
                    You don t have to answer.  Probably 
                    shouldn t have asked.

                                  JOSEPH
                    No.  It s okay.  I just... haven t 
                    thought about it.

                    This ll sound strange to a

                    It was the most beautiful thing I d

                    colors... the petals... the 
                    softness.  And... I wept.  In 
                    public.  For the first -- and the 
                    last time.
                          (then)
                    So I guess that s what I d tell 
                    Tamara.  Tell her... to find those 
                    things in life that make you cry.  
                    That make you feel.  Because 
                    they re what make you human.
                          (beat)
                    That s what I d tell her.  If I 
                    could.

    Off Joseph s grieving face...


      Lacy, is sitting on a plush, comfortable sofa next to Sister 
      Clarice who has been listening to her for quite a while now.

                                  LACY
                    ... that s how it started.  That s 
                    how I got involved...  I don t know *
                    what to do, Sister.  Where to go.  *

      With trembling hands, Lacy picks up a GLASS of water from the 
      coffee table -- which leaves a RING of WATER.

                                  CLARICE
                    You did the right thing by coming 
                    to me with this, Lacy.*

      Very deliberately, Clarice puts a fingertip in the ring of 
      water left on the table by Lacy s glass and begins tracing a 
      design with the water.

                                  CLARICE
                    I, too used to feel a void in my 
                    soul... I, too once hungered to 
                    know right from wrong... but not 
                    any more.

    She takes her hand from the table and Lacy looks down in at 
      what she s drawn -- THE INFINITY SYMBOL.  Lacy looks back at 
      Clarice in shock.

                                  LACY
                    Sister...?

                                  CLARICE
                    Welcome home, my child.*

      Clarice puts out her arms, and Lacy s control suddenly 
      vanishes -- she embraces Clarice with all her might and tears 
      roll down her cheeks.Then she gets hold of herself after a *
      beat and pulls backas it dawns on her that...*

                                  LACY
                    So thenBen did have something to *
                    do with the bombing.  He was the *
                      terrorist.*

      Clarice looks at her calmly, brushes back a lock of hair from 
    her face.

                                  CLARICE
                    What you need to understand,

                    is that labels like  terrorist  are 
                    what this corrupt and decadent 
                    culture calls people who try to 
                    fight the realevil in the world.  
                    Ben was eager to strike against 
                    that evil and so he did 
                    something... 
                          (sighs)
                    ... premature.  Something... 
                      unauthorized.  But was blowing up 
                    that train evil?  No.  He was 
                      fightingevil.  With all his heart.

                                  LACY
                          (turning pale)*
                    And Zoe...?*

      Clarice pulls Lacy back into her arms, rocking her like a 
      child.

                                  CLARICE
                    You have no idea how special Zoe *
                    was to us.  Or is...*

    Off Lacy, looking up at Clarice in astonishment...*


      Daniel escorts Joseph and William (who has a lot of Bucks 
      paraphernalia hanging off him) through the house.

                                  JOSEPH
                          (dryly)
                    Quite a place you ve got here.

                                  DANIEL
                    When I think that this all started 
                    with me tinkering in my parents  
                    basement...?  Well, it all seems a 
                    bit too much. *
                          (beat)
                    William, I m guessing you d like to 
                    see the gameroom?

      William looks to his dad.

                                  JOSEPH
                    It s okay, son.  Have fun.  I won t 
                    be long.

                                  WILLIAM

                    Cool!      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0678.


                                  DANIEL
                          (calls out)
                    Serge?

      Serge magically appears.

                                  SERGE
                    Ready.

                                  DANIEL
                    Please show William to game room 
                    and show him how to use the 
                    equipment.

      William and Serge head down the walkway as Daniel places his 
      hand on the security plate outside the door to his private 
      lab.  A beat and the doors OPEN.


      Daniel and Joseph walk into the lab.  Joseph looks around the 
      room in awe.  Daniel grabs a HoloBand from a case and holds 
    it up.

                                  DANIEL
                    Ever tried one of these?

                                  JOSEPH
                    Not much for that kind of thing.

                                  DANIEL
                    Indulge me. 

    He guides Joseph to a  scanning booth  and plugs the HoloBand 
      into the system.

                                  DANIEL
                    This is what happens when you buy a 
                    HoloBand at any retail store.

      Daniel indicates Joseph should step in.

                                  DANIEL
                    Basically, it scans your image for 
                    your Avatar which is, in essence, a 
                    virtual copy of you.  You ll feel a 
                    little tingling on your skin but I 
                    assure you, it s harmless.  

      Daniel hits a few keys and the booth glows blue as Joseph is 
      scanned.  On the monitor outside the booth we see the various 
      stages of scanning (much like we saw when Daniel grabbed the 
    Zoe Avatar): first a wireframeskeleton, then a rough  skin  
    and finally a rough approximation of Joseph s features.        "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0679.


    Two or three layers of detail layover the image until what 
      appears on the screen is an exact 3-D representation of 
      Joseph. A beat, then the blue goes off; the scan is complete.

                                  DANIEL
                    You can step out now.

      Joseph does, looks at what Daniel s looking at which is the 
      monitor displaying Joseph s image.

                                  JOSEPH
                    I ve looked better.

      Daniel removes the HoloBand from its perch.

                                  DANIEL
                    Okay, we re ready.

      Daniel gestures for Joseph to follow him to Zoe s computer 
    and sit.  Daniel puts the HoloBand on Joseph s forehead, puts 
    on his own personal HoloBand and sits next to Joseph in front 
    of Zoe s computer.

                                  DANIEL
                    Remember, this is going to seem 
                    real -- very real.  But it s all 
                    virtual -- an illusion.

      Joseph nods and Daniel taps the screen as before and...


      This is a completely sky blue limbo room.  Daniel and Joseph 
    are right in the center of it.  Joseph is, naturally, a 
      little disoriented.  He looks around, then down at his hand, 
      then over at Daniel.

                                  DANIEL
                    It takes getting used to.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Can I talk?
                          (realizing)
                    I guess I can.  Where are we?

                                  DANIEL
                    Inside a very basic computer 
                    program.  I haven t had time to do 
                    any decorating.  Step over here.

      Daniel starts to walk forward but Joseph feels like his feet 
    are  stuck  -- he appeals to Daniel for help.

                                  DANIEL
                    Just tell yourself to walk.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0680.


      Joseph slowly, haltingly puts one foot forward and then the 
      other and begins to figure out how to walk over to Daniel.  
      Together they walk a few more steps to a BROWN DOOR which 
      seems to  float  in the blue space.  Daniel OPENS the door.  
    He steps in and gestures for Joseph to follow.


      This room is like a plain apartment with no windows and basic 
      furniture.  As Joseph steps in, we see Zoe-A sitting on the 
      couch.  She gets up angrily at their approach.

                                  ZOE-A
                    What are you doing, Daddy?*

                                  DANIEL
                    Working.
                          (to Joseph)
                    This is Zoe.  My daughter.

      Joseph looks at Zoe-A in confusion for a moment... then 
      reacts in shock.  He stares at Zoe-A, who gives him a sullen, 
      annoyed look.  She suddenly jumps at him.

                                  ZOE-A
                    BOO!

      Joseph bolts back in panic --


      Joseph YANKS off the HoloBand, stands and backs up in horror.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Frak!

      Daniel quickly disengages himself from his HoloBand and 
      rushes over to Joseph who is completely freaked.  Joseph 
      pushes Daniel away from him.

                                  JOSEPH
                    The hell is that?  What kind of 
                    sick, twisted thing are you doing 
                    here?

                                  DANIEL
                    There s nothing twisted about it.  
                    And I didn t do it -- Zoe did.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Zoe did.

                                  DANIEL
                          (bittersweet)
                    Turns out... she was kind of a... 
                    chip off the old block.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0681.


      Joseph can see the emotional currents just beneath the 
      surface, wants to understand.

                                  JOSEPH
                    That s not her.  Our daughters... 
                    they re gone.  You know that.  

                                  DANIEL
                    Yes.  But I think they can come 
                    back.

                                  JOSEPH
                    That s crazy.

                                  DANIEL
                    Is it?  You know what your brain 
                    is, Joseph?  It s a database and 
                    processor.  That s all.  
                      Information and a way to use it.  
                          (beat)
                    What my daughter figured out... was 
                    how to harness all the information 
                    that made her who and what she was.
                          (beat)
                    It s genius, really.  She took a 
                    search engine and turned it into a 
                    way to cheat death.

                                  JOSEPH
                    That s not possible.

                                  DANIEL
                    What you saw in there iseverything 
                    about Zoe I knew.  Everything I 
                    loved.

      Joseph looks down at the HoloBand again.

                                  JOSEPH
                    It s an illusion -- you said so 
                    yourself.

                                  DANIEL
                    Joseph, that person you just saw -- 
                    they called her Zoe-A, by the way --
                    she s not... the original.  I know 
                    that.  She s a copy.  A perfect
                    copy.  In every way.

                                  JOSEPH

                    There s an axiom in science:  a

                      difference... isno difference.  
                    She looks like Zoe, she talks like 
                    Zoe, she thinkslike Zoe -- 
                    remembers all the events of her 
                    childhood, has the same likes, 
                    dislikes, flaws, strengths -- all 
                    of it.  Who s to say her soul 
                    wasn t copied as well.

                                  JOSEPH
                    You can t copy a soul.

                                  DANIEL
                    And you would know that how?  How 
                    can you prove or disprove that

                                  JOSEPH
                    Look... I know what I know, okay?  
                    And I know you can t copy a person.

                    her and the Zoe that lived in this 
                    house is just that -- she lived in 
                    this house instead of a virtual

      Joseph can feel his sincerity, wants to believe, doesn t know 
      what to do.

                    To get her from in there to out

                    particular piece of equipment.  I 
                    need something that will harness 
                    the virtual program Zoe wrote and 
                    let me put it into a physical body.

                                  JOSEPH

                    The device I need is called a Meta-
                    Cognitive Processor.  The problem 
                    is, there s only one company that 
                    has such a device.  And it s not 
                    Graystone Industries.

                    Okay...

                                  DANIEL
                    The only one in existence is owned 
                    by the Vergis Corporation.  Ever 
                    heard of it?

                                  JOSEPH
                    It s in Mars City.  On Tauron.

    And as those words come out of his mouth, it dawns on Joseph 
      what this has all been leading up to -- why he s here.

                                  JOSEPH
                    You bastard.

                                  DANIEL
                    I know your connection to the 
                    Ha la tha.  I know who and what you 
                    are.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0684.


      Daniel is between him and the door.  Joseph steps right up to 
    him -- his hard eyes glint dangerously.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Get out of my way.

      Daniel swallows, determined to hold his ground.

                                  DANIEL
                    I know about the pit in your 
                    stomach.  I know about the 
                    sleepless nights.  I know about 
                    wishing and praying to whatever 
                    gods will listen that you could 
                    have everything back the way it 
                    was.  
                          (beat)
                    I can bring Tamara back, Joseph.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Get out of my way -- I won t say it 
                    again.  

      Daniel steps aside and Joseph starts moving toward the door.

                                  DANIEL
                          (desperate)
                    Dammit Joseph, you can see your 
                    daughter again, isn t that worth 
                    any price you have to pay!

      Joseph hesitates at the door.

                                  DANIEL
                    If you walk out that door, you ll 
                    never know for sure.  You ll always 
                    wonder.  You ll walk past her room 
                    at night and you ll see her 
                    pictures and you ll ask yourself 
                    every day of the rest of your life 
                    whether you had a chance to bring 
                    her back.

      Joseph turns back with rage and pain etched in his features.

                                  DANIEL
                    If I m wrong.  You beat me up, have 
                    me killed -- whatever, I don t 
                    care.  But if I m right... and you 
                    can see Tamara again...

      Joseph glares at him, but Daniel s got him.  After a beat...

                                  JOSEPH

      Joseph SLAMSinto the apartment and makes a bee line for Ruth 
    in the living room.

                                  JOSEPH
                    How dare you fill my son with all 
                    that Temple of Mars crap!  

                                  RUTH
                    I don t know what you re talking

                    there might be another life for his 
                    mother, his sister?  What would be

                    see them again?      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0687.


                                  RUTH
                    By the gods, you re sounding like 
                    one of these Caprican nut-cases 
                    with their afterlife nonsense.  

                                  JOSEPH

                    Finally!  He speaks like a man.
                          (beat)
                    Whether you like it or not, 
                    William s a Tauron, something he 
                    knows deep down inside.  Something 
                    no amount of time on Caprica will 
                    take away from him.  You know this 
                    is true, because deep down inside, 
                    you are a Tauron too.

    Off Joseph, knowing but not wanting to admit that what she s 
      saying is true.


      A large CROWD is waiting on the platform.  Amanda pushes 
      through the people, looking for someone, but the press of 
      people is incredibly dense, making movement difficult.  She 
      struggles -- finally sees Zoe standing on the edge of the 
      platform, looking down the tunnel for the next train.  Amanda 
      pushes against the press of humanity -- tries to yell, but 
    has no voice.  

    She finally reaches Zoe -- Zoe glares at her with seething 
      anger.  Zoe tries to talk to her -- still no sound comes out 
    of her mouth.  Zoe watches her impassively.  Amanda reaches 
    out to embrace her daughter, but the second Amanda s hands 
      touch her, Zoe is PROPELLED BACKWARD as if knocked back by a 
      blow.  

      A MLMT TRAIN roars out of the tunnel just as Zoe falls right 
    in its path --

      Amanda tries to SCREAM --


      Amanda s eyes pop open in bed.  She lies there, still 
      reliving the experience of having personally killed her own 
      daughter.  

                                  DANIEL (O.S.)
                    Good morning.

      Amanda bolts upright to see Daniel, smiling, holding a tray 
    of food and a single rose in a vase.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0688.


                                  AMANDA
                    What -- what s this?

                                  DANIEL
                    I made breakfast.

                                  AMANDA
                    Youmade breakfast?

                                  DANIEL
                          (mock insulted)
                    Excuse me, I used to cook for you 
                    all the time.

      With a flourish, he removes the dish-cover and presents the 
      meal.

                                  DANIEL
                    Eggs a la Graystone, wild mushroom 
                    sausage, rosemary bread and freshly 
                    brewed coffee.  Enjoy.

    She sees he s really making an effort and is touched.  He 
      sets the tray on the beside her and turns to go.

                                  AMANDA
                          (impulsive)
                    I miss you.

    The words strike home.  He turns back and she pulls him down.  
      Kisses him deeply and with sudden emotion.

                                  DANIEL
                    We can get through this.  We can.  
                    Together.  The two of us.  Just us.  

      That strikes a guilty nerve with Amanda.  She looks back down 
    at the tray, starts to fuss with the food.

                                  AMANDA
                    Yeah.  The two of us.

                                  DANIEL
                    Something wrong?

    She hesitates for a moment, then...

                                  AMANDA
                    A man came by the Hospital a few 
                    days ago.  An Agent Duram from the 
                    Global Defense Department.
                          (tears well up)
                    Daniel, he accused Zoe of being 
                    involved in... "Soldiers of the *
                    One".*

                    That she might ve been... one of 
                    the terrorists on the Lev.  Our 
                    baby.

    She grabs on to him as she starts to sob uncontrollably.  
      Daniel is grateful for the fact that she can t see his face 
    at the moment. 

                                  AMANDA
                    You think it could be true?

                                  DANIEL
                    Of course not.  They re just... 
                    fishing for suspects.
                          (then)
                    Don t worry about it.  Eat.

    He wipes her tears away.

                                  DANIEL
                    Eat and maybe later I ll give you 
                    the chance to try and beat me in 
                    straight sets.

    He kisses her on the head, gets up and EXITS.


      Joseph sits across from VAL CHAMBERS (70s) in the massive 
      office of the Secretary of Defense.  Chambers has an amused 
      look on his face, while Joseph s is stone.

                                  CHAMBERS
                    You re not actually threatening me, 
                    are you?

                                  JOSEPH
                    Mr. Secretary, I m simply 
                    delivering a message.  There is no 
                    threat, real or implied, in 
                    anything I ve told you.

      Chambers studies him for another beat, still very amused.

                                  CHAMBERS
                    You Taurons, you ve got stones, 
                    I ll give you that --

                    Let s be clear.  I don t like your 
                    boss.  I don t like your planet and 
                    I don t like your people.  But even 
                    a sack of shit has its uses.

                    So you crawl under the rock where 
                    the  Gautrau lives and you tell 
                    him that not only will I not be 
                    pressured or blackmailed, but that 
                    the government of Caprica is about 
                    to take a very special interest in 
                    him, his business, and his low-life 
                    lawyers.

      Joseph eyes him calmly.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Perhaps you d like to sleep on it.

                    Deliver the message, errand boy.  
                    Word for word.

      Joseph stands up.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Good-bye, Mr. Secretary.  Safe

                    I m not going anywhere.

      Joseph just looks at him... then EXITS.


      Daniel slips into bed with Amanda, softly kissing the nape of 
    her neck.  She responds sensuously, turning to face him.  
      Their lips meet each other and soft gentle, kissing gives way 
    to passion.  

                                                                          INTERCUT:


      Joseph sits on his daughter's bed.  He looks over at the 
      desk, sees a family holo-photo of the four of them all in 
      this very room, laughing at something Tamara has just done.  

                                                                          INTERCUT:


      That same night, we creep slowly through a well decorated 
      bedroom that we ve never seen before.  As we get up to the 
      occupant in the bed, we realize it s... Secretary Chambers.  
      Sleeping soundly.

    of grief and sadness give way to their pure desire for each 
      other.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0692.


    -- Joseph sits there in the room of his lost child, looking 
    at the family that will never laugh like that again.

    -- A SHADOW crosses over Chambers  face and remains there.  
      Standing bedside is SAM, naked from the waist up, his body 
      covered in the traditional TATTOOS.  

    -- Daniel and Amanda s passion...

    -- Joseph s grief...

    -- Sam s mission.  He slowly pulls two elaborately intricate 
      daggers from behind his back.

                                  SAM
                    Hello, Val.

      Chambers flips open his eyes in horror.  Before he can utter 
      a single shriek, Sam SLICEShis throat cross-wise with the 
      daggers.  

                                  SAM
                    Sa gre hsal, b gher ya, Ha la tha!

    The lifeblood of Chambers flows over the sheets and his eyes 
      dim...

    ... as Daniel and Amanda climax in one another s arms...

    ... and Joseph finally cries for his dead child...

    ... and Sam sheathes his daggers and leaves the room as 
      swiftly as he entered it.

                    I have.  And guess who my chief 
                    suspect is?  Your husband.

                                  AMANDA
                    Oh, come on, Tomas.  

                                  VERGIS
                    He wanted that technology.  So he 
                    arranged for someone to get it.  
                    Took the only prototype.  Destroyed 
                    the lab records.  Killedthe men 
                    who knew how it worked!

                                  AMANDA
                    Is this what you ve finally become, 
                    Tomas?  A paranoid little man who 
                    actually believes that the richest 
                    and most powerful industrialist in 
                    the twelve worlds is a murderer and 
                    a thief?
                          (beat)
                    He wouldn t stoop to your level.

      Vergis advances aggressively towards Amanda who doesn t 
      flinch.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0694.


                                  AMANDA
                    You try it, Tomas.  You frakking 
                      trytouching me.

      Vergis holds back.

                                  AMANDA
                    No?  Then get out of here before I 
                    call security.

      A beat and then...

                                  VERGIS
                    So, it comes down to Daniel after 
                    all.

                                  AMANDA
                    It was always Daniel.

      Another beat and then Vergis storms out.


      Joseph is sitting at a work table while Daniel carefully 
      takes a SMALL ELECTRONIC DEVICE out of a durable, shock-proof 
      case.  He s treating the device like it s extremely fragile.

                                  DANIEL
                    Gotta hand it to Vergis... it s an 
                    elegant design.  Fortunately, it s 
                    close enough to our preliminary 
                    work that it shouldn t be too hard 
                    for Cyrus to construct a convincing 
                    paper trail...

    He barely breathes as he carries the MCP and sets it into a 
      small CRADLE on the table.  Then he seals it behind a GLASS 
      CASE.  Once it s sealed, Daniel lets out a long breath.  
      Joseph is unmoved.

                                  DANIEL
                    You know this has more raw 
                    computing power than the three 
                      supercomputers at Apollo University 
                    combined?

                                  DANIEL
                    I won t know that until I try to 
                    put it into a robotic body and try 
                    to download Zoe-A into it.

                                  JOSEPH
                    How long?

                                  DANIEL
                    Couple days.  Got a surprise for 
                    you, though. 

      Daniel gestures to the FLASH stick over on the work bench, 
      where it s enmeshed in a maze of circuitry and connections.

                                  DANIEL
                    Tamara-A is ready to go.

                                  JOSEPH
                    What...?

                                  DANIEL
                    I used Zoe s original avatar 
                    program to search and download any 
                    data on Tamara Adams -- school 
                    records, medical, DNA -- well, 
                    you ve heard the list.  About 300 
                    megabytes worth.

                                  JOSEPH
                          (shocked)
                    You mean... she s... in there?

                                  DANIEL
                          (barely hearing him)
                    You know, the more I work with 
                    Zoe s code, the more I realize she 
                    was nothing short of a computer 
                    genius... can t believe I never 
                    noticed...

                                  JOSEPH
                    I want to see her.

    He gestures to a HoloBand.

                                  DANIEL
                    Thought you would.  Go through the 
                    yellow door.

      Joseph looks over at the HoloBand like it suddenly turned 
      into a snake that might bite him.  He gingerly picks it up 
    and puts it on...      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0696.



      Joseph finds himself in the blue limbo once more.  TWO DOORS 
    now float before him -- brown and YELLOW.  He OPENS the 
      Yellow door --


      Virtually identical to the other Holding Room with the same 
      generic furniture.  Joseph ENTERS and sees --

      TAMARA

      Sitting on the far side of the room, her head in her hands 
    and looking very, veryfrightened.  She looks up at her 
      father... there s a moment before she recognizes him.

                                  TAMARA
                    Daddy...?

                                  JOSEPH
                    My gods...

      Joseph moves toward her, sweeps her up in his arms, his heart 
      bursting.

                                  JOSEPH
                    It s okay, honey... I m right 
                    here...

                                  TAMARA
                    Oh, Daddy.  I m so scared.  What is 
                    this place... why am I here...?

                                  JOSEPH
                    It s confusing, I know.  But it s 
                    all going to be all right.

                                  TAMARA
                    I feel so strange...  

                                  JOSEPH
                    You re fine.  Everything s all 
                    right.

    She pulls back from him, her breath coming in short, 
      frightened pants as hysteria begins to creep up on her.

                                  TAMARA
                    No it s not.  This isn t right.  
                      Something s wrong -- really, really
                    wrong.  What s going on?  Why s the 
                    door locked?  Why can t I leave 
                    here?        "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0697.


                                  JOSEPH
                    This will take some time to 
                    explain... the important thing 
                    is... we re together...

                                  TAMARA
                          (starting to lose it)
                    I can t remember how I got here... 
                    I can t remember where I was before 
                    now... none of this seems real... 
                    I don t feel real... this isn t... 
                    real.  This isn t REAL!

                                  JOSEPH
                    Willie misses you -- I miss you -- 
                    we can be a family again --

                                  TAMARA
                    Daddy, I can t feel my heart!  WHY 
                    ISN T MY HEART BEATING!? 

    She SCREAMS --


      Joseph tears the HoloBand from his head and throws it across 
    the lab.

                                  DANIEL
                    You okay -- what happened?

      Joseph s heart is racing -- touches his chest, aware on some 
      level of the irony.  It takes a moment to steady himself.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Destroy it.

                                  DANIEL
                    What?

                                  JOSEPH
                    She doesn t want to live like 
                    that... she couldn t feel her 
                    heart... it s an abomination.

                                  DANIEL
                    It s a miracle.  Joseph -- she s 
                    probably confused by everything, 
                    that s only natural.  But once 
                    she s out of the virtual world and 
                    in a real body --

      Joseph suddenly PINS HIM TO THE WALL, barely restrained 
      violence now boiling to the surface.  Daniel s eyes go wide.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0698.


                                  JOSEPH
                          (low, deadly)
                    Destroy... it.  Now.  

                                  DANIEL
                    Okay.  Okay, Joe... whatever you 
                    say.

      Joseph releases him, and Daniel picks up a computer sheet and 
      makes a few marks.  He holds it out for Joseph to see.

                                  DANIEL
                    There -- I ve wiped all the files 
                    from memory.  She s gone.

      Joseph suddenly can t get out of here fast enough.  He heads 
    for the door.

                                  DANIEL
                    You ll be back.  A week, a month, a 
                    year.   

                                  JOSEPH
                    Our daughter s are dead.  I have to 
                    live with that.  And so do you.

      Joseph EXITS.

                                  DANIEL
                          (quiet)
                    No.  No, I don t.

    As Daniel goes back to working on the computer sheet.

                                      ACT EIGHT

      FADE IN:


      Joseph has buried himself in paperwork.  Sam enters the room, 
      a dark cloud over him.  Joseph notices him from the corner of 
    his eye but doesn t turn his attention away from his 
      paperwork.

                                  JOSEPH
                    I m due in court in fifteen

                    It won t take long.

      Joseph looks up.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Okay...

                                  SAM
                    I have some news.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Obviously not good news.

                                  SAM
                    It s about the bombing.

                                  JOSEPH

                                  SAM
                    You must hear this.  You know who 
                    Daniel Graystone is?

                                  JOSEPH
                          (giving away nothing)
                    I ve heard of him.

                          (choking on it)
                    It was his daughter, Yoseef.

    For Joseph, it s as if the room starts spinning.

                                  JOSEPH
                    What are you saying?

                    The Gautrau has a source in the

                    died.
                          (turning red)
                    I promised you that who ever did 
                    this would die.  I don t care how 
                    powerful the bastard is, I ll find 
                    a way to--

                                  JOSEPH
                          (turning steely)
                    Not yet, Sam.  I promise you we ll 
                    take care of this.  But we ll wait 
                    for the right time.

    Off Sam, looking into his brother s eyes and what he sees 
      scares him...


      Daniel is in the virtual room sitting on the couch with Zoe-
    A.  

                                  ZOE-A
                    You really think this is gonna 
                    work?

                                  DANIEL
                    It ll work.  Remember, this is what

                                  ZOE-A
                    Yeah.  This is what you do.

    She gets up off the couch and walks away for a few steps.

                    What is it?

                    No it s not.  It s never been my
                    home -- and it stopped being home 
                    for... the other Zoe a long time 
                    ago. 

                                  DANIEL
                    I don t know what that s supposed 
                    to--

                                  ZOE-A
                    Daddy, why do you think your 
                    daughter was on a Lev train instead 
                    of being in school?

      Daniel looks uncomfortable, hasn t wanted to think about 
      that.

                                  ZOE-A
                    Think she was just cutting school?  
                    Going shopping?  She was leaving
                    Caprica.  And she wasn t coming 
                    back.

                                  DANIEL
                    You don t know what she was doing.  
                    You can t know -- you weren t 
                    there.

                                  ZOE-A
                    I know where she was going.  She 
                    told me.  She had a plan.  She was 
                    going to Gemenon.  You know why?  
                    Because she found God -- the real 
                    God.*

      Daniel s up and on his feet.

                                  DANIEL
                    Stop it.*

                    The children of Caprica are lost, *
                    Daddy.  We re all lost if we don t *
                    turn to the light. *

                                  DANIEL
                    We ll talk about this later.

                                  ZOE-A
                    When are you going to realize that *
                     later  is too late.  When did you *
                    ever listen, ever want to listen?  *
                    You and Mom, you just knew *
                      everything.  And your arrogance was *
                    killing your daughter. *

                    That swhy you lost her... not *
                    because of some bomb.

      Daniel looks at her for a long beat then raises his hands to *
    his head --


      Where Daniel is taking the HoloBand off.  He waits a beat, 
      then moves to the U-87 ROBOT seen earlier.  THE MCPis 
      sitting in the robot s HEAD -- essentially, its  brain. 

    As he begins to ACTIVATE the power systems of the robot...


      Daniel is working at the computers.  The ROBOT begins to 
      POWER UP, its systems coming to life.  Data is rolling across 
    the monitor screens.  In a scene right out of Frankenstein, 
    the lab is filled with flashing lights, beeping consoles... 

    ... Daniel watches the robot... and IT BEGINS TO MOVE!  Tears 
    of joy stream to his eyes, as the ROBOT TURNS to look at him.

      Then suddenly, it all collapses.  ALARMS sound, the data 
      streams stop and the monitors all start to display the same 
      message:

      SYSTEM ERROR.  DATA CRASH.  IRRECOVERABLE ERROR.

                                  DANIEL
                    No-no-no-no-

    The ROBOT COLLAPSES backward, and falls inert to the floor.  
      Daniel rushes to the monitors, tries to rework the controls, 
    but to no avail.  Desperate, he picks up the HoloBand --


      Daniel is here, but no Zoe-A.  He looks around wildly.

                                  DANIEL
                    Zoe!  ZOE!!!!

    But no one answers.  She s gone.  He stands there alone, 
      suddenly very much aware that his daughter is truly dead.


      Joseph sits with William in his bedroom.

                                  JOSEPH
                    We're going to make a new beginning 
                    starting tonight, you and me.

                    Our family will survive this, we're 
                    going to put our lives back 
                    together.  Your mother is gone and 
                    Tamara is gone.  They re not coming 
                    back.

      Suddenly, without warning, tears begin to stream down 
      William s cheeks.  Joseph takes his son in his arms and they 
      hold each other tight as Joseph struggles with his own 
      emotions.

                                  JOSEPH
                    I want you to know who you are, 
                    William.  We come from a long, 
                    proud line of Tauron peasants who 
                    knew how to work the land and still 
                    stand proud.  You re named after 
                    your grandfather, did I ever tell 
                    you that?

                                  WILLIAM
                    No.

                                  JOSEPH
                    He was killed in the Tauron 
                    uprising fighting for what he 
                    believed was the right of all the 
                    Children of Kobol -- to live free.  
                    It s a good name William and you 
                    should wear it proudly.  And our 
                    last name isn't Adams - I changed 
                    it when I arrived on Caprica.  
                          (beat)
                    Our family name is... ADAMA and 
                    it s a good, honorable Tauronname.

      Tears begin streaming down his cheeks as he holds his son.  
    We then notice RUTH in the doorway, taking in the scene.


    The U-87 ROBOT (last seen firing paint balls at the 
      observation window) is down on the test floor, its weapon at 
    the ready.  The room has now been set up with a variety of 
      OBSTACLES.  

      ANGLE - OBSERVATION ROOM

      Looking down on the arena, are Daniel, Cyrus, a WOMAN with 
      jet-black hair and glasses, and a TRIO of CAPRICAN MILITARY 
      OFFICERS.  Daniel looks noticeably older since we last saw 
      him, a sense that he s aged years in only a few days.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/06104.


    ON THE TESTING FLOOR

    SIX small Serge-like ROBOTS ENTER the arena from six 
      different doors and begin to FIRE PAINTBALLS at the U-87.  
    The reaction is swift and startling -- the U-87 whirls around 
    and avoids all the paintballs, while at the same time it 
      takes aim and FIRES back.  

      Each of the smaller robots tries to hide behind the 
      obstacles, but each one is hit with a paintball as the U-87 
      ducks and dives with fluid movements too fast and supple to 
    be human.  In a matter of seconds, the demonstration is over.  
    The U-87 has hit each and every attack robot with a precisely 
      aimed paintball, while never once taking a hit.  The U-87 
      brings itself back to attention, and looks up toward the 
      Observation Window as if awaiting instructions.

      ANGLE - OBSERVATION ROOM

    The military officers are clearly impressed, and start to 
      talk quietly among themselves.  The woman -- SECRETARY OF 
      DEFENSE JOAN LEYTE (50s) -- turns to Daniel.

                                  LEYTE
                    Dr. Graystone... you may just have 
                    won yourself a contract.

      Cyrus is ready to cheer, but restrains himself.  Daniel 
      barely reacts, his eyes weary and a bit haunted.

                                  DANIEL
                    Thank you, Madam Secretary.

    She looks back down toward the testing floor, where 
      TECHNICIANS are OPENING the head casing of the U-87, 
      revealing the MCP now nestled inside.

                                  LEYTE
                    That s your Meta-Cognitive 
                    Processor?

                                  DANIEL
                    Yes.  

                                  LEYTE
                    You know Vergis Corporation has 
                    made certain... accusations.

                                  CYRUS
                    Sour grapes.  If they really 
                    thought they had a case, they d 
                    have us in court by now.

                                  LEYTE
                    Pity that the Official Secrets Act 
                    prevents them from doing just that.

                          (beat)
                    But no matter.  We had no intention 
                    of taking this contract off-world 
                    anyway.  It s been my experience 
                    that you can never trust a Tauron.  
                    Deceit is in their DNA.

      Daniel nods absently and follows Leyte and the others as they 
      leave the observation area.

                    Hmm.  Cylon.  Interesting.

      Secretary Leyte and her entourage leave.  On Daniel, as he 
      stares down at his creation...

                    What s wrong?

    He looks up at her for a long moment.

    She puts her arms around him and they hold each other.

      Lacy shrugs and leads her out the door.*


    The place is deserted.  The equipment, idle for the night.  
    The U-87 lays on the workbench, immobile.  But only for a 
      second or so.  It suddenly MOVES, then STANDS, scans the 
      room, sees a mirror.  The U-87 walks over to a mirror and 
      stares at itself.  A beat, then it places its hand on the
