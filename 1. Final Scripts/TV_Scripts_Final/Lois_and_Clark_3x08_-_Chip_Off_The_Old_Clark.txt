    The engagement ring sparkles in the light as we PULL BACK to 
    find LOIS looking at it with a smile.  CLARK is at the 
    stove, cooking dinner.  Both are still basking in the 
    afterglow of having just gotten engaged.

                                   LOIS
                       (looking at ring)
                  Funny about this thing... I look 
                  down at it during the day... I'm 
                  always surprised to see it there...
                  And I think about what it means...
                  And about you...

                                   CLARK
                  ... And how long it took you to 
                  finally put it on...

                                   LOIS
                  That, too... We've been through a lot.

                                   CLARK
                  'A lot?' Lois, salmon swimming 
                  upstream don't have the mating 
                  trouble we've had.

                                   LOIS
                       (settling in to watch him
                        with a smile)
                  Yeah, but now we're just this old, 
                  almost-married couple... And we'll 
                  be like this forever.  You cooking, 
                  me watching.

                                   CLARK
                  You're never cooking?

                                   LOIS
                  It's not really something I do.

                                   CLARK
                  I thought it was just lack of time.

                  I guess there's all kinds of things
                  I still have to find out about you.

                                   LOIS
                  And me about you.  There's no

                                   CLARK
                  Did I mention the flying?

    She puts an arm around his neck.

                                   LOIS
                  I only marry men who fly.

    And they're kissing.  As it heats up, the phone RINGS.
    Still kissing Lois, Clark reaches behind him, grabs it.

                                   CLARK
                       (into phone; preoccupied)

                  Wait, I was just gonna find out all
                  this juicy stuff about you...

    Clark smiles back at her as he flips on TV.

                  The story, Jimmy, is the crazy 
                  times we live in when anyone can 
                  get media coverage with a cook and 
                  bull story like that.  We, by the 
                  way, won't be wasting ink on it.

    Clark, in a mood, has entered during this, gone to desk.

                                   JIMMY
                  What do you think, C.K.?  I mean if 
                  _I_ was Superman and had, you know, 
                  his looks... his muscles... tight 
                  pants... women fallin' all over 
                  _me_... I sure might be tempted 
                  to...

    He suddenly notices Clark has just been staring at him

                       (off Clark's look)
                  ... Or not.  Probably not.

                  Could we get back to the _real_ 
                  news, here?  Clark, the President 
                  of Tanzor is in town for the 
                  signing of a peace treaty with 
                  Fostonia.

                                   CLARK
                  Yeah, they've been enemies for a 
                  century.  There are die-hards in 
                  both countries who don't want the 
                  treaty.

                                   PERRY
                  You and Lois get on it.
                       (then)
                  How _is_ this engagement thing,
                  anyway?  You two must be happier'n
                  pigs in slop.

    Lois approaches her desk, not looking that happy.

                                   LOIS

                                   CLARK
                  Me, either.

    Jimmy and Perry share a knowing look.

                                   CLARK (CONT'D)
                       (to Lois)
                  Perry wants us to cover the
                  President of Tanzor's arrival.

                                   LOIS
                       (without enthusiasm)
                  Fine.

    Lois and Clark smile weakly at Perry, start away, as:

                                   JIMMY
                  Hey Lois, what'd you think of that
                  babe who says she had Superman's...

                       (too cordial)
                  Oh? 'Babe?'  Is she a 'babe?'
                  Clark, do you think she's a 'babe?'

                                   CLARK
                  Uh, I... didn't really notice.

    He takes Lois' arm, heads for elevators.

                                   JIMMY
                  'Not notice?!'  How could you
                  possibly not no...

    Clark glances back with a "cool it" look, and they're gone.

                                   JIMMY (CONT'D)
                  Is he okay?

                  So we'll just go to the President's
                  arrival and try to forget all

                  written.  The guy arrives, waves,
                  says peace is good, surprise
                  surprise.  Not a good use of our

                                                     CUT TO:


 7  EXT. LEIGH-ANNE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    7   

    The modest house has a crowd of reporters and TV cameras
    before it.  Lois and Clark make their way to the door as
    GERALDO RIVERA emerges, dabbing his eyes with a
    handkerchief.

                                   LOIS
                  _Geraldo_?

                       (deeply moved)
                  Hi, Lois.  Boy, I've covered some
                  tragic stories before...  But
                  _this_...

    He just waves a hand, unable to go on, then leaves as Lois
    and Clark stare.  The door re-opens, Leigh-Anne stands
    there, dramatically clutching a scarf, dressed for sympathy.

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                  I forget.  Which of you kind people
                  did I say was next?

    The reporters shout, wave arms, jockey for position.

                                   LOIS

    She goes inside, Clark leans close to Lois.

                                   CLARK
                       (quietly)

    Lois and Clark peer back around the doorframe.  Leigh-Anne
    gestures to the sofa, which Jesse pats and leaves.  The room
    is a shambles from a long period of abuse: Cracked plaster,
    boy-shaped holes in the walls, splintered furniture. Lois,
    a bit awkward with children, approaches Jesse.

                                   LOIS
                       (so friendly)
                  Hi, Jesse.  I'm Lois. I'm here to
                  be your mommy's friend so she'll
                  tell me the _real_, _true_ story of
                  your life.

                                   JESSE
                  I don't like you.

                  I see.

                                   JESSE
                  I like him!

    He goes to Clark, grabbing his leg.  There's a soft metallic
    CLANK as their bodies hit.  Clark stares at Jesse, smiles
    weakly at Lois.

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                  Wow, he's usually shy with
                  strangers.  Shall we get started?

    She touches Lois' arm, they sit on the sofa, Lois glancing
    uncomfortably back at Clark and Jesse, then turning to
    Leigh-Anne.

    Clark moves across one end of the room, trailed by Jesse,
    surveys the damage, runs a hand around a boy-shaped hole.

    This is the feared international terrorist, ANONYMOUS,
    master of disguise, now done up as a Secret Service guy.
    While the other men scan the crowd, he lets a small silver
    transmitter with tiny antenna slip down one side of his leg
    until it rests on the curb.  He steps back into the squad as
    the PRESIDENT, in formal military-like garb, emerges from
    the car.  He waves to the crowd then starts moving slowly
    toward the building, surrounded by Secret Service guys.

    Now as the HUM grows more shrill, the Secret Service types
    all begin reaching for their earpieces.  All but Anonymous.
    Suddenly the noise becomes a SHRIEK and all the guards grab
    their ears and crumple to the ground.  Anonymous thrusts a
    hand into a pocket, is clearly holding a gun, moves swiftly
    to the bewildered President.

                                   ANONYMOUS
    Right this way, Mr. President.

    He starts hustling the man toward the side of the building,
    when suddenly SUPERMAN BLURS into view.

                  of a radical group inside their own 
                  country.  I don't _have_ a

                  Parry's right; people shouldn't 
                  expect more from Superman than any 
                  other guy.  Pretty sophisticated 
                  work for a radical group..'.

                                   CLARK
                  Word is, they may have hired that 
                  terrorist, 'Anonymous.'  Look, I 
                  thought this whole thing was behind 
                  us.

                  Yeah, well, a shadow's behind you,
                  but you can't shake it. I thought
                  Anonymous was kicked outta the
                  country.

                                   CLARK
                  He may have kicked himself back in.
                  Easy to do.  No one's ever seen his
                  face...  Lois, I can take anyone
                  else thinking what they wanna
                  think, but you can't tell me _you_
                  think...

    She jumps up to pull pages from printer.

                  But what about _before_?!  Neither
                  of us was born the day we fell in
                  love, so I guess I really don't
                  have the right to be upset about
                  anything that happened before
                  then...  But this upsets me! It
                  really upsets me! And everywhere I
                  go, it's all I hear and...  It
                  _upsets_ me!

                                   CLARK

35  EXT. S.T.A.R. LABS - HAND HELD - DAY                            35   

    Another mob scene.  Vendors hawk "Super Stud" t-shirts,
    Superman diapers, rattles, etc.  Angry women wave signs
    reading "SUPER DEADBEAT."  Reporters and video crews fight
    for curb space.  Among then is a lackluster Lois.  Suddenly
    Superman BLURS into their midst and the mob goes wild.

                                   REPORTERS
                  Superman! If the boy is yours,
                  will you seek custody?!  Are there
                  other 'Super Kids' around the
                  country?!  Is it true you have a
                  wife in Red Bluff, Montana?!  What
                  do you say to teens who wanna be
                  just like Superman?!

    Superman raises hands to calm them.

                                   SUPERMAN
                  You people all know me and what I
                  stand for.
                       (sees Lois)
                  And what I won't stand for.  I've
                  always tried to protect the weak
                  and the helpless.  And that's why
                  I'm here today.  To protect this
                  little boy from any more of _this_.

    Lois wishes she were invisible.  Suddenly the reporters
    desert Superman and Lois for:


36  A LIMOUSINE                                                     36   

    It pulls up to the curb.  Leigh-Anne, Anonymous, and Jesse
    emerge.  Jesse's in a mini-super suit.  CAMERAS FLASH, the
    press closes in, Jesse looks scared.

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                       (eating it up)
                  Hello! Hello, everyone!  Wave to
                  the nice people, Jesse.

    Jesse and Superman sit side-by-side on an examining table in 
    the empty room.

                                   SUPERMAN
                  Are you okay?  It's tough 
                  sometimes, isn't it, being 
                  different?  Sometimes it's scary.  
                  And sometimes you get mad, and it'd 
                  be easy to hurt people because 
                  you're so strong.  But the cool 
                  thing is, we can do good for 
                  people.  And most people _are_ 
                  good, Jesse, even those crazy ones 
                  outside.  So... any questions?

                       (innocently)
                  Are you my daddy?

    Superman is stunned by the directness of the question.  The 
    awkward moment is broken by DR. KLEIN, who enters.

                                   DR. KLEIN
                  Hello, Superman, Jesse.  We 
                  obviously won't be drawing blood 
                  from you.  I take it Jesse's skin 
                  is also impervious to puncture?

                                   SUPERMAN
                  Yeah, I'm afraid so.  Though why
                  that is, I don't know.

                                   DR. KLEIN
                       (patient smile)
                  Yes.

                  I _don't_ know.
                       (plucks hair from head)
                  Here.  You can trace D.N.A. from

                                   DR. KLEIN
                  That's right.

                                   SUPERMAN
                  I talked to Jesse, Dr. Klein, he'll
                  be glad to do the same.

                                   DR. KLEIN
                  Excellent.  We'll do our best to
                  rush the tests along, Superman.

                  Do you have any idea what raising 
                  Jesse's been like?  Before I got 
                  pregnant, I had prospects.  You 
                  probably don't know I was runner up 
                  in the Junior Stenographer Pageant.

                                   SUPERMAN
                  I didn't know that.

                  that's just a dream.

                  Jesse's not just any child.  And 
                  since he got.... the way he is... I 
                  can't keep him in clothes, 'cause 
                  he grows so fast... Can't keep a 
                  roof over our heads, 'cause he 
                  wrecks every place... Can't keep a

                  I'd help if I could, but how?  I 
                  don't have money, or credit cards, 
                  or a shoebox full of cash.  Does 
                  this look like a rich man's

                  I don't want your money.  At first 
                  I did, but this has gotten so big!  
                  I have a book offer...  A Movie of 
                  the Week Deal...  A kid's clothing 
                  company wants to do a 'Jesse'

                  the kind of life I never coulda

                  won't be doin' so bad, myself.

                                   SUPERMAN
                  But it's based on a lie!  And

                  way people are makin' money out
                  there. Who am I?  The last Girl

                  Then I'll keep fighting any way I

                  I thought you called me to say

                                   SUPERMAN
                  No, I didn't.  You left a message
                  for me with Clark Kent.

                                   LEIGH-ANNE

    Superman rushes in with Leigh-Anne.  The place is empty.

    The place is swarming with cops, dusting for fingerprints, 
    etc.  A Detective takes Leigh-Anne's statement.

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                       (sobbing)

                  Jesse...

    Clark enters, adjusting tie.

                  Any clues?

    Detective closes note pad, shakes his head.  Clark steps 
    away, lowers his glasses.

    A few tiny fragments of putty-like substance lie in the 
    crevice between carpet and wall.  Clark picks them up, 
    sniffs, reacts to the distinctive odor, pockets one, takes 
    the other to the Detective.

                                   CLARK
                  You night want to check this out.
                  I'm not sure what it is.

    The Detective looks at it, step away, putting it in an 
    evidence bag as Lois enters, going to Clark.

                                   LOIS
                  Some guys in a news van saw the 
                  lawyer, Rafferty, drive out of here 
                  about two hours ago.  No one 
                  thought anything of it.

                                   LEIGH-ANNE

                  This is all my fault.  All my

    She lurches away.  Clark watches sympathetically, then
    glances over at the dining area where one of Jesse's little
    capes hangs on a chair.  Clark goes over, picks it up, looks
    at it sadly.

    joins Clark at the table.

                  In a way I can't explain.

    He turns to look at her.

                                   LOIS (CONT'D)
                  I amaze myself sometimes.  I'm so
                  used to tracking down the truth...
                  Always so sure things aren't what
                  they appear to be... I forget that
                  sometimes truth is just staring me
                  in the face.

                                   CLARK

                                   LOIS
                  The truth is what you tell me.  And
                  what I tell you.  Because that's
                  the kind of relationship we have to
                  have.

                                   CLARK
                  Lois, the best day of my life was
                  the day you found out I was
                  Superman.  It meant no more

                  Leigh-Anne... Let me ask you.  Were 
                  you and Jesse on a plane about a 
                  year ago over Michigan?

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                  I already told the airline, I'll 
                  _pay_ 'em when I can!  I was _sure_ 
                  I had tickets when I got on,

                  Jesse had the window.  It was his

                  Outside a motel.

    She's busted.  Tears well up in Leigh-Anne's eyes, and she 
    sits down, turning away from them.

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                  I really ain't good for much, am I?

                  You love your son, Leigh-Anne.

    Clark smiles sympathetically, starts away; Lois hurries

                  now we have to...

                                   DR. KLEIN
                  I don't have the results.  This is 
                  much more serious.  As I was 
                  analyzing Jesse's hair sample, I 
                  noticed that its molecular 
                  structure varied throughout the 
                  strand.  It seems there's been a 
                  gradual, yet steady...
                       (beat)
                  it's easier if I show you.

    Klein takes out a strand of hair, and a pair of scissors 
    from his lab coat.

                                   DR. KLEIN (CONT'D)
                  This end is about a year old.

    He tries to cut the end of the hair.  The scissors break.

                                   DR. KLEIN (CONT'D)
                  And now, the much _newer_ part...

    With scissors, he cuts the top of the hair easily.

                                   LOIS
                  What are you saying?  Jesse's
                  losing his super-powers?

                                   DR. KLEIN
                       (nods)
                  I'm afraid so...

                                   LOIS
                  Superman said the transfer was 
                  imperfect... So the results might 
                  be temporary...

                                   DR. KLEIN
                  And after this recent exertion... 
                  Miss Lane, Jesse is no safer right 
                  now than any ordinary child.

                  Okay...  Okay... Listen.
                  Leigh-Anne.  We think we know where
                  Jesse might be.  Jesse said 'red
                  choo-choo' just before he left with
                  the President.  Superman is
                  checking out the train yards as we
                  speak...

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                  But that may not be the right place
                  at all!  'Choo choo' is Jesse's
                  word for trains.  But also for big
                  smokestacks.

                                   LOIS
                  Smokestacks?

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                  They remind him of those old
                  fashioned steam engines...  So he
                  uses the same word for both.

    Lois grabs her coat.
