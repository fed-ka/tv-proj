ACT ONE

FADE IN:


A crowd is gathered outside the home. Various onlookers and 
paparazzi stand behind yellow crime scene tape watching as 
dozens of cops enter and exit the mansion. 

A reporter stands off to the side, talking into a camera.

REPORTER
... the victim was a domestic 
worker employed by renowned fashion 
designer, Adrian Powell. While 
police now have a suspect in 
custody, a motive for the stabbing 
remains unclear... 

As the reporting continues, we PAN to REVEAL four women of 
Latin descent, standing apart from the crowd, watching.

They are ROSIE FALTA, 35, SWEET and VULNERABLE, CARMEN VERDE, 
30, SEXY and AMBITIOUS, ZOILA DEL BARRIO, 44, TOUGH and SLY 
and VALENTINA DEL BARRIO, 18, BEAUTIFUL and SHY. 

They watch in silence for a beat. Then:

ROSIE

I barely said  hello .

ZOILA
Rosie, stop that. You couldn t know 
this would happen. 

CARMEN
So how old was Flora? Twenty?

Zoila gestures to the crowd of reporters and police swirling 
about. The women nod grimly in agreement.

FROM A DISTANCE we see the four women as they continue to 
stare at the crime scene.

REVEAL they are being watched by MARISOL, 39, INTELLIGENT and 
DIGNIFIED. She is clearly intrigued by the quartet. Her eyes 
narrow with a determination as she watches them.

We re INSIDE a swirl of muddy water.

We COME UP to REVEAL Rosie furiously swimming through the 
water. She trails behind a dozen Latino men and women, all 
headed for the river bank.

ANGLE on a TALL LATINO MAN stumbling onto the shore. He turns 
back to the people in the water, yelling for them to hurry.

As some of the others struggle to reach the river banks, a 
woman swimming in front of Rosie screams and points.

ANGLE on Border Patrol vehicles directly behind the tall man. 
Their lights turn on as they race toward the people.

The tall Latino man starts yelling for everyone to jump back 
in the river. There is confusion and panic and screaming.

Men in uniforms jump out and grab the tall man. Other Border 
Patrol guards start to wade into the river pull people out. 

CLOSE on Rosie as she looks around frantically for a way to 
escape. She takes a deep breath and goes under the water.

The guards start detaining the people and forcing them to put 
their hands over their heads. 

CLOSE on some reeds in the river. Rosie comes up for air 
behind the reeds. As she pants for air, she looks over at the 
scene in the distance. She then slowly sinks back down and 
swims away.
