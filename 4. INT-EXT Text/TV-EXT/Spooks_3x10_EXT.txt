      A quiet London street with kids kicking a ball about outside. 
      Parked in the street is a van which is obviously our standard 

      MI5 surveillance vehicle.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Fiona and Adam leaving the house walking down the street past 
      the white van where Adam holds the door to their car open for 
      his wife.

                    Butterfly said the meeting is 
                    scheduled for this evening but the 
                    house would be empty until at least 
                    twelve.  Which gives us an hour 
                    max.   

      Danny checks his watch.

                                  DANNY
                    We have to be sure before we go in.

      Fiona indicates a neighbourhood watch sticker on the door of 
      a house.

                                  FIONA
                    You go next door and try the bell.  
                    I ll see if the local vigilante can 
                    help.

      Fiona rings the bell.  Door is answered by an elderly woman.

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    Hello, Mrs Edwards?  I m from the 
                    local council. Just wanted to check 
                    that you were still at this address 
                    for the electoral register ...

      We go with Danny to the next house.  Rings bell.  No answer. 
      Joined by Fiona.

                    Mrs Edwards says there hasn t been 
                    anybody there for two days.

                                  DANNY
                    So?

                    the upstairs.  

      He nods.

      She laughs and takes out a lock-pick from her pocket.  Within 
      seconds the door s open.

                    Bloody hell, that was quick.

      He looks up and down the street.  It s deserted.

      The van drives away. The street is deserted as if they were 
      never there.

      Flashback: Fiona remembers walking Wes from her car to the 
      school gates.  She bends down, kisses him and tousles his 
      hair.  He laughs, turns and runs into school.  She watches 
      him go.

      Adam walking and talking on mobile.

                      everything you want today.

                    So, can you meet me?

                    Sure, but you ll have to give me an

      Adam is carrying a bag.  He arrives at a cafe and sits down. 
      Orders a coffee.  Checks his mobile, calls but gets no 
      answer.  Sits back and picks up a paper that somebody has 
      left behind.  Hardly notices when a woman slides into the 
      seat opposite him.  It s Khatera.  He looks up and smiles but 
      his expression changes when he realises that it s not Fiona.


                                  ADAM
                    I m afraid that seat s taken.  I m 
                    waiting for somebody.

                                    KHATERA
                    And I m afraid that your wife won t

                    your wife and the other MI5 agent

      TERRORIST BASE - DAY 3. 1332

      Fiona is sitting in a chair as Ahmed s mobile rings.

                                  AHMED
                    Adam Carter?  I am sitting with 
                    your wife and the other MI5 
                    officer.

                                  ADAM
                    Who are you?  What do you want?

                                  AHMED
                    All you have to do is stay with my 
                      colleague.  She will give you all 
                    your instructions.  Be warned that 
                    she is equipped with an alarm that, 
                    if triggered, will mean that I will 
                    kill both of my hostages. Equally, 
                    I receive regular messages from 
                    her.  Should I not hear them I 
                    shall kill the hostages.  Is that 
                    clear?

                                  ADAM
                    OK, listen.  I won t waste time 
                    trying to flannel you.  Just tell 
                    me what your demands are and we ll 
                    see what we can work out here.

                                  AHMED
                    My only demand is that you stay 
                    with my colleague and do exactly as 
                    she says.  If you do that, then 
                    your wife and the other officer 
                    will stay alive for a little 
                    longer.

                                  ADAM
                    Let me talk to her.  Why should I 
                    do what you say if I have no 
                    guarantee that you ll keep your 
                    word?

      Ahmed passes her the phone.

                    The North African lead was a red 
                    herring, Adam. Butterfly was

                    The tube maps were just a decoy ...

      CRACK!  Ahmed slaps her across the face with his gun.  She 
      goes flying.


      Danny shuts his eyes.

                                  AHMED
                    That noise you just heard was the 
                    sound of my gun handle connecting 
                    with your wife s face.

                                  ADAM
                    Please don t hurt her.  I ll do 
                      everything you ask.

                                  AHMED
                    Although your bargaining position 
                    is very weak, you still have 
                    choices. You can for example make 
                    the death of the hostages less 
                    agonising than being burned alive.  
                    Do you understand, Mr Carter?

                                  ADAM
                      I understand.

                                  AHMED
                    Good.  We understand each other. 
                    That s a promising start.

      He snaps the mobile shut and looks at Fiona who is struggling 
      up holding her hand to her bleeding face.  Now her expression 
      is one of utter terror.  She crawls towards Danny who tries 
      to move his body so she can curl against him for comfort.

      (End of split screen)

      Adam stares at Khatera.

      Adam puts the bag on the table.

                    And the mobile.

                    I have to call in a status report 
                    or they ll start looking for me.  I

                    half an hour which again will alert 
                    him to my absence if I miss it with 
                    no call.

      She hesitates.  Then she takes out her mobile and calls. 
      Speaks away from Adam in Arabic obviously receiving 
        instructions from Ahmed.  Clicks mobile shut.

                                    KHATERA
                    OK, call in.  But you know what the

                    best suggestion in the end.

                                  RUTH
                    You got her chocolates?

                                  ADAM
                    You talked me into it.  Fiona loved 
                    them just like you said she would.

      His tone is very flat, no hint of banter.  A tiny beat.

                                  RUTH
                    Right.  OK, well hope she 
                      appreciates them.  Speak to you 
                    later.

      Phone call ends.

                                    KHATERA
                    What was all that about chocolates?

                                  ADAM
                    It s my wife s birthday.  My 
                    colleague wanted to know what I d 
                    bought her.

      Khatera stares at him.

                                    KHATERA
                    Don t try and play any tricks with 
                    me.

                                  ADAM
                    It wasn t a trick.  Quite the 
                    opposite.

                                    KHATERA
                    It would be very dangerous for you 
                    to try and fool me.

                                  ADAM
                      Especially when you re unarmed.


                                    KHATERA
                    But remember that all I have to do 
                    is press a button.

      A beat.

                    How long do we wait here for?

                                    KHATERA
                    Until I say so.

                                  ADAM
                    You approve of that do you?  
                    Hitting a woman.  Threatening to 
                    burn her alive?  How would you have 
                    felt if it was a member of your 
                    family?

                                    KHATERA
                    My family were killed by American 
                    bombs in Iraq. 

                                  ADAM
                    I m sorry to hear that.

      She regards him contemptuously.

                                    KHATERA
                    Save your sympathy.

      Adam and Khatera are still sitting at the cafe.

                                  ADAM
                    Why us?

                                    KHATERA
                    Why not?  Why my family, why the 
                    kid in the refugee camp?  What 
                    makes you think you re entitled to 
                    impunity?

                                  ADAM
                    But why did you choose us?

                                    KHATERA
                    You re not the only ones who can 
                    gather intelligence.

                                  ADAM
                    You re clearly well-educated.  Are 
                    you originally from Baghdad?

      She doesn t answer.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Spent a bit of time there myself.

                                    KHATERA
                    Spying on my people!

                                  ADAM
                    No actually, it was after I left 
                      university and I went travelling 
                    all around the Middle East.  

                                    KHATERA
                    How nice for you.
                          (beat)
                    You ll never understand the anger 
                    you cause.

                                  ADAM
                    I ve had a love affair with that 
                    part of the world since I was a 
                    student.  I think I do understand 
                    it a little.

                                    KHATERA
                    Then it s a shame that your rulers 
                    don t, because it will bring you 
                    great suffering in return.  Now 
                    stop talking so much.


      Her mobile rings.  She listens and then snaps it shut.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    Shut up.

      Khatera is preparing to move Adam.

                                  ADAM
                    Where are we going?

                                    KHATERA
                    You don t ask the questions.

      As they get up, a group of people with bright jackets and 
      promotional material for what appears to be a new brand of 
      sweets come into the cafe outside which they are sitting.  
      They re accosting people, pressing sample sweets on them and 
      asking them to answer a questionnaire.  A pair of them comes 
      across to Khatera and Adam.  One of them is Zafar.  Adam 
      shows absolutely no recognition of him as he approaches.  
      Zafar has the irritatingly perky demeanour of people who 
      pester you on the street.  While his colleague distracts 
      Khatera, Zafar clasps Adam s hand warmly.  Adam glances down 
      to see a tiny voice-comm device.  In a swift and subtle 
      gesture he moves one part to his ear.  It s taken a fraction 
      of a second.


                                  ZAFAR
                    Hello, Sir.  You look like you re 
                    having a good day with your 
                    beautiful wife ...

                                  ADAM
                    Go away we re not interested.

                    Come onnnnnn ... it s just a few 
                    seconds.  Here s a free sample 
                    which should make you a little 
                    sweeter for her.  Don t think your 
                    lovely lady needs it ...

      He hands him a small packet of sweets which is also being 
      done by other members of the group. Adam pockets it.  Behind 
      him, Khatera is trying to fend off the persistent attention 
      of another of the group but in doing so she has to turn away 
      from Adam.  Zafar sits down with Adam and shows him the 
      clipboard.

                                  ZAFAR (CONT D)
                    They re very straight-foward 
                    questions ...

                                  ADAM
                    I really haven t got time to talk 
                    to you ...


      (Split Screen between the Cafe and The Grid)

      Monitor bleeping signals to Harry that he s connected to 
      Adam.

                                  HARRY
                    Adam, what s going on?

      Adam is turned away from Khatera.  His body language suggests 
      he is trying to get rid of Zafar.

                                  ADAM
                    Don t know.

                                  HARRY
                    Where are Danny and Fiona?

                                  ADAM
                    I can t answer that question 
                    either.

      He glances around to see that Khatera is still being accosted 
      by two other of the volunteers, one of whom has managed to 
      partially obstruct her view of him.

                                  HARRY
                    You need to bring the girl in, 
                    Adam.

      Adam leans in toward Zafar as if studying the questions he is 
      being asked.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    for sure.  This isn t what we 
                    thought.

      Khatera is trying to fend off her interviewer and keep an eye 
      on Adam.


                                  HARRY
                    Who s the girl? 

                                  ADAM
                    Iraqi.  Clever, middle class, lived 
                    abroad.

                                  HARRY
                    I m going to get pressure to bring 
                    her in for interrogation.

      Khatera is almost managing to free herself of the attentions 
      of her interrogators.  Adam spots this but needs to get one 
      last message to Harry.

                                  ADAM
                    I d definitely not be receptive to 
                    a  strategy like that.  It could 
                    fatally alienate your market.

                                  HARRY
                    There s a tracking device in the 
                    sweet packet you were given and we 
                    can hear your conversations with 
                    the girl.  Try and get us 
                      information we can use.  But you 
                    haven t got unlimited time, Adam.

                                  ADAM
                          (loudly to Zafar)
                    Look, I haven t got the time or the 
                    patience for this.  Please go away 
                    and leave us alone.

      Zafar holds his hands up and moves away.  Whole thing has 
      taken a matter of seconds.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                          (to Khatera and Harry)
                    You re threatening to kill my wife

      Khatera and Adam walking.  On The Grid Ruth and Harry are

      Adam and Khatera are walking through the rush hour crowds,

                                    KHATERA
                    Your Prime Minister is entertaining 
                    tonight.  

                                  ADAM
                    The dinner at the Mansion House?

                                    KHATERA
                    Prior to that he is giving out 
                    awards for humanitarian endeavour 
                    overseas.  You may see the irony in 
                    that.  In attendance will be 
                    several traitors from my country 
                    and their American sponsers.  
                    You ll get me in there.

                    It s a closed list. Every 
                      invitation is matched to a photo 
                    and a well-known person.  There s 
                    no way I can do that.

                                    KHATERA
                    We were watching you remember?  
                    You ve had several meetings with a 
                    Special Branch Liaison Officer. You 
                    must convince him to let me in with 
                    you.


                                  ADAM
                    And if I can t?

                                    KHATERA
                    I thought you were good at your 
                    job.

                                  ADAM
                    What are you going to do?  You re 
                    unarmed.

                                    KHATERA
                    That does not concern you. You just 
                    get me in.

                                  ADAM
                    Call your boss.  Tell him I m 
                      cooperating with you now.  That I 
                    helped you get away from MI5 and 
                    that I m going to get you where you 
                    want to be.

      She opens her mobile and starts to speak in Arabic. He 
      listens closely.

      People are milling about outside, waiting to go through a 
      cordon.  Security is very tight and everybody going in is 
      being thoroughly checked.  People are even having their heels 
      inspected.  Men with earpieces swivel their gaze from side to 
      side. Beside them, Adam seems small and insignificant.  He 
      whispers to a security man who talks into his radio.  Turns 
      to Khatera.

                                  ADAM
                    He s bringing the Special Branch 
                    Liaison Officer.

      They stand and watch the people going in and presenting their 
        credentials.  Khatera is increasingly nervous.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Stop fidgeting you ll draw 
                    attention to yourself ... Mike!

      A Special Branch Liaison officer who Adam was going through 
      the list with earlier comes over grinning.  Adam claps him on 
      the back.

                    Adam, where s your lovely wife?

                    Left her at home doing the washing 
                    up.

                                  MIKE
                    But you seem to have found an 
                    equally glamorous replacement.

                                  ADAM
                    This is Khatera.  I need security

      Harry appears, watches them, decides not to intrude.  We stay

      Ruth is weeping over Danny s body his hand clasped in hers. 
      Harry stands looking grimly at the corpse.  



                                  RUTH
                    Oh no.

      Harry looks over to where a member of Special Forces is 
      gesturing to him.

                                  HARRY
                    Ruth, I have to leave you for a 
                    moment.

                                  RUTH
                    I m staying here with Danny.

                                  HARRY
                    Of course.

      She watches him walk towards the officer. 

                                  RUTH
                          (still in deep shock)
                    Harry s had to leave us for a 
                    moment.  But I ll stay here with 
                    you, I m still here with you, 
                    Danny, I m staying right here with 
                    you. 

      She caresses his hand.

      She looks up and sees Adam who is still holding Fiona 
                                                                                              *

      A member of Special Forces comes over to Adam and Fiona. He 
                                                                                              *
      hands her the silver brooch.

                                    SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
                    Is this yours?

      She takes it in her hand and they both look at it.

                                  ADAM
                    You might not have liked it but 
                    there was no need to just throw it 
                    away.

                                  FIONA
                    I didn t, Adam.

                                  ADAM
                    I know, sweetheart. I know.

      She turns the brooch around. 

                                  FIONA
                    I broke it.  

                                  ADAM
                    Picking locks. You were always good 
                    at that.

                                  FIONA
                    But I broke the brooch you gave me. 
                    Look, it s broken, it s broken, 
                    Adam.

      She starts to weep - obvious displacement grieving for Danny.

                                  ADAM
                    Shhh, darling.  The brooch will 
                    mend.

      And he holds her in his arms.  The helicopter takes off.  
                                                                                              **
      Harry is back with Ruth, we re on his face as he looks at 
      her.  His grief is tangible.  

      Then he puts his arm around her and we close on them 
      embracing while her hand still holds that of her fallen 
      colleague.
