SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA
Wearing only underwear, a bathrobe and clogs, MILES RAYMOND
comes out of his unit and heads toward the street. He passes
some SIX MEXICANS waiting to work.
He climbs into his twelve-year-old CONVERTIBLE SAAB, parked
far from the curb and blocking part of the driveway. The car
starts fitfully.
As he pulls away, the guys begin backing up the truck.
Miles rounds the corner and finds a new parking spot.
Miles's Saab chugs up the ramp and merges.
INSERT - NEW YORK TIMES CROSSWORD PUZZLE --
-- pressed against the STEERING WHEEL. The puzzle is about
1/3 finished.
As though from an adjacent car, we see Miles driving while
carefully filling in an answer.
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --
A SIGN reads:
RANCHO PALOS VERDES
PALOS VERDES ESTATES
1/4 MILE
PAN TO MILES as he signals to change lanes. The finished
puzzle lies on the passenger seat.
The houses on this block are blandly palatial as in so many
affluent Southern California suburbs.
Miles's car pull into the driveway behind an older BMW and
two LEXI. He gets out and trots toward the front door.
The Saab heads north.
The Saab heads north -- now passing through LOS ANGELES.
Miles signals and begins to head for an EXIT.
JACK
Whoa, why are we getting off?
MILES
I've just got to make one quick stop.
Won't take a second.
JACK
What?
MILES
I thought we could just say a quick
hello to my mother.
JACK
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were
supposed to be up there hours ago.
MILES
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I
don't feel right driving by her house
and not stopping in, okay? It'll
just take a second. She's right off
the freeway.
The Saab takes an EXIT.
JACK (O.S.)
How old's she going to be?
MILES (O.S.)
Um... seventy... something.
JACK (O.S.)
That's a good age.
OMIT.
OMIT.
The Saab rounds a corner and parks in front of a modest CONDO.
SUPERIMPOSE:
OXNARD, CALIFORNIA
Approaching the front door, Miles pulls a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS
out of a plastic grocery store bag. Jack carries a bottle of
CHAMPAGNE.
Miles pulls a BIRTHDAY CARD out of the bag too.
MILES
Wait a second.
He pulls a PEN from his pocket and signs it. As he licks the
envelope, Jack rings the bell.
Moments later PHYLLIS comes to the door. She is a matronly
older woman in a nightgown and housecoat.
MILES AND JACK
Surprise! Happy Birthday!
The boys offer up the flowers and champagne. Phyllis slurs
slightly as she speaks -- she's been doing some celebrating
of her own.
PHYLLIS
My God. Miles. And Jack! What a
surprise. I can't remember the last
time you brought me flowers.
They hug.
JACK
They're from both of us.
PHYLLIS
A famous actor bringing me flowers
on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
MILES
A famous actor who's getting married
next week.
PHYLLIS
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I
hope that girls knows how lucky she
is, marrying no less than Derek
Summersby.
The boys follow her inside.
Miles and Jack are seated in webbed chairs around a circular
glass table. They are mid-meal.
Everyone is more than a little lubricated, especially the
birthday girl as she returns from the kitchen with another
plate of food.
JACK
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious.
Absolutely delicious.
PHYLLIS
(sitting)
They're just leftovers.
JACK
Is it chicken?
PHYLLIS
I could have made something fancier
if a certain someone had let me know
that a certain someone was coming
for a visit with a certain special
friend. Could have made a pork roast.
MILES
It was a surprise, Mom.
PHYLLIS
And I could have already put clean
sheets on the other bed and the fold-
out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and
the twins are picking us up at 11:30
to go to brunch at the Sheraton.
They do a magnificent job there.
Wendy is so excited you're coming.
Silence. Jack freezes, his fork halfway to his mouth.
MILES
You talked to Wendy?
PHYLLIS
Just now. She's thrilled. And the
kids.
MILES
(trying to be chipper)
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty
eager to get up to... you know, but,
uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
PHYLLIS
Well, you boys do what you want. I
just think it would be nice for us
to be together as a family on my
birthday.
MILES
Uh-huh.
(wiping his mouth)
I'll be right back.
He gets up and heads into the house.
As Miles slides open the door and takes his seat again, Jack
is pouring Phyllis another glass.
PHYLLIS
And what was that other one you did,
the one where you're the jogger?
JACK
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That
was for Spray and Wash.
PHYLLIS
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
JACK
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in
it with me. She was something.
PHYLLIS
I just remember you jogging. So when's
the wedding?
MILES
(irritated)
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We
told you.
JACK
And Miles is my best man, Mrs.
Raymond. My main man.
PHYLLIS
(another drink of
wine)
Miles, when are you going to get
married again?
MILES
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
JACK
Two years ago, buddy.
PHYLLIS
You should get back together with
Victoria. She was good for you.
Embarrassed for his friend, Jack just stares at his food.
PHYLLIS
She was good for you.
(turning to Jack)
And so beautiful and intelligent.
You knew her, right?
JACK
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
PHYLLIS
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you
need some money?
MILES
I'm fine.
Miles takes another drink of wine.
CUT TO BLACK:
UNDER BLACK, a CARD --
SUNDAY
MILES (O.S.)
Jack. Jack.
In a series of shots, the Saab -- now with its TOP DOWN --
makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that
those familiar with the Santa Barbara area might recognize.
MUSIC accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the
rhythm of a road trip.
The car now descends the Santa Ynez Mountains and heads toward
Buellton. Miles and Jack must SHOUT to be heard in the open
car.
MILES
You know what? Let's take the Santa
Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
JACK
Whatever's closest, man. I need a
glass.
MILES
These guys make top-notch Pinot and
Chardonnay. One of the best producers
in Santa Barbara county.
(looking out the window)
Look how beautiful this view is.
What a day!
JACK
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
MILES
I like all varietals. I just don't
generally like the way they manipulate
Chardonnay in California -- too much
oak and secondary malolactic
fermentation.
The Saab passes over the 101 and turns onto SANTA ROSA road.
The boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines.
MILES
Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous?
And the ocean's just right over that
ridge. See, the reason this region's
great for Pinot is that the cold air
off the Pacific flows in at night
through these transverse valleys and
cools down the berries. Pinot's a
very thin-skinned grape and doesn't
like heat or humidity.
Jack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and
articulateness.
The Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long
gravel DRIVEWAY.
JACK
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel
sells.
MILES
Thanks, Jack. So do I.
(noticing)
Here we are.
Miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot. As they
get out and walk --
MILES
So what'd you guys finally decide on
for the menu?
JACK
I told you. Filet and salmon.
MILES
Yeah, but how are they making the
salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill
sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
JACK
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always
have white wine with fish?
MILES
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we
have to find out because it's going
to make a big difference.
JACK
(taking out his phone)
Let me call Christine.
MILES
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go
taste.
JACK
I owe her a call anyway.
Miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room
as Jack SPEED DIALS.
JACK
Hey, honey. So we're up here about
to taste some whites, and we need to
know how the caterers are going to
make the salmon.
Jack listens, then grows suddenly impatient.
JACK
No, I know, I didn't forget, but we
wound up at Miles's mom's house, and
it got really late, and it was hard
to call, so I'm calling you now. I
said I was sorry. Yes, I did.
(to Miles)
You heard me say I was sorry, right?
Miles just shrugs.
JACK
Miles heard me say I was sorry.
As Jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he
wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of
earshot.
JACK
Give me a break, will you? I just
called to find out about the salmon --
for our wedding -- to be more
involved, like you said -- and all
you want to do is get into it about
last night and, okay, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry I didn't call. You're totally
right. I know, but I'm trying to
make this the best wedding I can
with the best wine we can find. Don't
I get any credit for that? Okay.
Look, I've got to go. I'm out here
in the parking lot, and Miles is
waiting for me...
And so it goes, Jack's voice rising and falling. Miles decides
to head inside.
The Saab passes through this Danish-themed tourist town.
SUPERIMPOSE --
SOLVANG
The Saab makes its way into this very average-looking Central
coast town right off the freeway.
SUPERIMPOSE --
BUELLTON
The Saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel. And look --
there's the WINDMILL itself, its decorative blades motionless.
Freshly showered and dressed for dinner, Miles and Jack amble
along the shoulder of this busy local two-lane highway. They
pass a mall and a car dealership.
JACK
I thought you said it was close. Now
I'm all pitted out.
MILES
It's not even a mile.
JACK
We should have driven.
MILES
Not with the wine list these people
have. We don't want to hold back.
JACK
You think I'm making a mistake
marrying Christine?
MILES
Whoa.
JACK
Come on, do you think I'm doing the
right thing? Tell the truth. You've
been through it.
MILES
Well, you waited for good reason,
and you proposed to Christine for
some good reason. So I think it's
great. It's time. You've got to have
your eyes open, that's all. I mean,
look at me. I thought Victoria and I
were set for life.
JACK
Christine's dad -- he's been talking
about bringing me into his property
business. Showing me the ropes. And
that's something, considering how
long it took him to get over I'm not
Armenian. So I'm thinking about it.
But I don't know, might get a little
incestuous. But Mike does pretty
well. A lot of high-end commercial
stuff.
MILES
So you're going to stop acting?
JACK
No way. This would just provide some
stability is what I'm saying. I can
always squeeze in an audition or a
commercial here and there, you know,
keep myself in the game in case
something big comes along.
MILES
Uh-huh.
JACK
We're not getting any younger, right?
And my career, well, it's gotten
pretty, you know, frustrating. Even
with my new manager. Maybe it's time
to settle down.
MILES
If that's what feels right.
JACK
(convincing himself)
It does. Feels right.
MILES
Then it's a good thing.
JACK
(nodding, feeling
better)
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Miles leads them away from the road and across a parking
lot. The camera PANS to reveal --
THE HITCHING POST, a local institution.
The guys walk drunkenly along the shoulder as CARS WHIZ BY.
JACK
The girl is looking to party, and
you tell her we're going to go back
to our motel room and crash? Jesus,
Miles!
MILES
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
JACK
The chick digs you. She lit up like
a pinball machine when she heard
your novel was getting published.
MILES
Now I've got another lie to live
down. Thanks, Jack.
JACK
I'm trying to get you some action,
but you've got to help me out just a
little bit.
MILES
Didn't seem to me like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.
JACK
Somebody had to do the talking. And
by the way, I was right. She's not
married.
MILES
How do you know?
JACK
No rock. When she came to the bar,
sans rock.
Establishing.
The Saab winds along this beautiful road that meanders through
large open vineyards.
DISSOLVE TO:

A MAP and a MOVING LINE show the boys' route.

GRAPES growing on the vine.
DISSOLVE TO:
Framed by foreground grapevines, the Saab passes in the
distance.
DISSOLVE TO:
Miles brings the Saab to a stop, and the guys get out. Before
them lies an incredible view of endless vineyards.
MILES
Nice, huh?
JACK
Beautiful.
MILES
Victoria and I used to like this
view.
(lost in nostalgia)
Once we had a picnic here and drank
a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon
and artichokes, but we didn't care.
JACK
Miles.
MILES
She has the best palate of any woman
I've ever known. She could even
differentiate Italian wines.
JACK
Miles, I gotta tell you something.
Victoria's coming to the wedding.
MILES
I know. You told me. I'm okay with
it.
JACK
Yeah, but that's not the whole story.
She got remarried.
MILES
She what?
(long pause)
When?
JACK
About a month ago. Six weeks.
MILES
To that guy? That guy with the
restaurant...
Jack nods. Miles looks down at his shoes and draws a long
breath. Then he stiffly gets back in the open car and closes
the door.
JACK
Miles... MILES...
Miles continues to stare straight ahead.
JACK
(exploding)
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
MILES
I want to go home now.
JACK
You've been divorced for two years
already. People move on. She has!
It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes
you feel special or something.
MILES
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
JACK
What do you think?
MILES
You drop this bombshell on me. Why
didn't you tell me before?
JACK
Because I knew you'd freak out and
probably get so depressed you wouldn't
even come on this trip. But then I
figured here would be the best place
to tell you. We're here to forget
about all that shit. We're here to
party!
MILES
(undeterred)
I'm going to be a fucking pariah.
Everyone's just going to be holding
their breath to see if I'm going to
get drunk and make a scene. Plus
Tony fucking Levin?
JACK
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to
Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's
cool.
MILES
(horrified)
You've all been talking about it?
Behind my back? Talking about it?
Miles turns and locates an open BOTTLE of wine in the back
seat. He uncorks it and begins to swig.
JACK
Hey, hey, hey. No, you don't!
Jack tries unsuccessfully to grab the bottle from Miles, but
Miles bolts out of the car.
A VERY WIDE SHOT --
Pursued by Jack, Miles dashes down the hill, all the while
taking huge swigs from the bottle.
OMIT.
Miles slows to walk between rows of GRAPEVINES. He polishes
off the bottle and tosses it. A painting Jack catches up
with him in the adjacent grapevine corridor.
Miles's face crumbles as though he were about to cry. Then
he collapses to the ground and closes his eyes tight.
Jack looks around impatiently for a moment. Then he squats
down so he can see Miles underneath the vines.
JACK
Miles?
Miles ignores Jack and focuses on the beautiful RIPE GRAPES
that surround him. They seem to distract him from his pain.
JACK
You going to be okay?
Miles looks up and shakes his head a definitive NO. Jack
can't help but LAUGH.
DISSOLVE TO:
The sun hangs low as the Saab pulls into the parking lot,
Jack at the wheel.
Miles is killing time by the car staring at his shoes. He
looks over and sees Jack waddling over from the tasting room
with TWO CASES OF WINE.
JACK
Get the trunk.
MILES
You have the keys.
Jack puts the cases down and glances back at the building.
JACK
We're on.
MILES
What?
JACK
She called Maya, who's not working
tonight, so we're all going out.
MILES
With Maya?
JACK
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
Jack puts the wine in the trunk, and they get in the car.
JACK
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it
all going on.
MILES
Well, she is cute.
JACK
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And
you almost tell her I'm getting
married. What's the matter with you?
(drumming on the
steering wheel)
Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
The boys get out of the car and walk along a timbered sidewalk
in this tourist town with wine tasting rooms and gourmet
restaurants.
JACK
Please just try to be your normal
humorous self, okay? Like who you
were before the tailspin. Do you
remember that guy? People love that
guy. And don't forget -- your novel
is coming out in the fall.
MILES
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it
called?
JACK
Do not sabotage me. If you want to
be a lightweight, that's your call.
But do not sabotage me.
MILES
Aye-aye, captain.
JACK
And if they want to drink Merlot,
we're drinking Merlot.
MILES
(dead serious)
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving.
I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
JACK
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No
Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
Miles takes a SMALL BOTTLE from his pocket and rattles it.
JACK
And don't drink too much. I don't
want you going to the dark side or
passing out. Do you hear me? No going
to the dark side.
MILES
Okay! Fuck!
Miles quickly POPS A XANAX. Jack gives him a final look in
the eye.
JACK
We're going in.
For a flash, Miles is walking an unstable, narrow ROPE BRIDGE
extending vertiginously across a great CHASM.
The Saab pulls into a gravel DRIVEWAY and comes to a stop
outside this wood-framed cottage.
Jack and Miles get out and head for the front door. On the
way, Jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string
of FOUR CONDOMS.
JACK
(tearing)
Here. One for you, three for me.
Miles wordlessly takes his. Just before they climb the porch
steps --
MILES
You sure you want to do this?
Jack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile
incredulity.
THE FRONT DOOR is open. Jack knocks twice on the SCREEN DOOR
before going in.
Miles wanders in to find Maya squatting in front of a little
temperature-controlled WINE STORAGE UNIT.
MILES
Hi.
MAYA
Hey.
MILES
She got anything good?
MAYA
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots
and Syrahs.
(calling out)
Hey, Steph? You sure we can open
anything? Anything we want?
STEPHANIE (V.O.)
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
MILES
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I
have completely underestimated
Stephanie.
MAYA
Who do you think you're dealing with
here?
Maya slips out a bottle of ESCHEVAUX.
MAYA
How about this?
Miles nods vigorously. Maya looks back and forth between
Miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed. Then she slides it
back in.
MAYA
Nope. I don't think we know each
other well enough.
(picking out another
bottle)
I'd say this guy's more our speed.
They rise, and Miles glances at the ANDREW MURRAY SYRAH and,
raising his eyebrows, agrees. Maya begins opening it.
MAYA
So what gems do you have in your
collection?
MILES
Not much of a collection really. I
haven't had the wallet for that, so
I sort of live bottle to bottle. But
I've got a couple things I'm saving.
I guess the star would be a 1961
Cheval Blanc.
MAYA
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's
just sitting there? Go get it.
(pushing him, playfully
stern)
Right now. Hurry up...
Miles laughs, fights back a bit.
MAYA
Seriously, the '61s are peaking,
aren't they? At least that's what
I've read.
MILES
Yeah, I know.
MAYA
It might be too late already. What
are you waiting for?
MILES
I don't know. Special occasion. With
the right person. It was supposed to
be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
Understanding, Maya considers her response.
MAYA
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc,
that's the special occasion.
MILES
How long have you been into wine?
MAYA
I started to get serious about seven
years ago.
MILES
What was the bottle that did it?
MAYA
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
Miles whistles and raises his eyebrows. Maya pours, and they
clink their glasses together before savoring the wine.
MILES
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but
this is tasty. Really good. How about
you?
MAYA
(tastes again)
I think they overdid it a bit. Too
much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
MILES
(tasting again,
impressed)
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the
money.
Then Miles absently scans the REFRIGERATOR DOOR and spots a
PHOTO of Stephanie holding a LITTLE GIRL.
MILES
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is
cute.
MAYA
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
MILES
Is she sleeping or...?
MAYA
She's with her grandmother. She's
with Steph's mom. She spends a lot
of time over there. Steph's... well,
she's Stephanie.
Jack's voice-over voice from the other room...
JACK (O.S.)
"And now for a low, low 4.8% APR..."
...is followed by PEALS OF LAUGHTER.
MAYA
You got kids?
MILES
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up.
That was the one unpolluted part of
my divorce -- no kids.
MAYA
Yeah, same here.
Maya nods as she sips again, looking distant for a moment,
thinking about something else.
MAYA
Let's go in there.
Maya takes the bottle, and they wander into --
Maya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab. She puts
it in PARK and gets out.
AT THE SAAB --
Miles rolls down his window as Maya leans over.
MAYA
You know how to get back to the
Windmill, right?
MILES
Got it.
MAYA
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I
really did.
MILES
Good. So did I.
MAYA
Okay. See you around.
MILES
Um... did you still want to read my
novel?
MAYA
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Miles turns to the backseat, locates a large MANUSCRIPT BOX,
and hands it to Maya.
MAYA
Wow. Great.
He turns around again, produces a SECOND BOX, and hands it
over as well.
MILES
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop
reading at any time. I'll take no
offense.
MAYA
Goodnight, Miles.
She gives him a friendly peck on the cheek.
After she gets back in her car, she heads in one direction
while Miles heads in the opposite.
OMIT.
UNDER BLACK --
TUESDAY
Jack's cellphone RINGS.
Miles wanders out and looks down at Stephanie.
STEPHANIE
That was fun last night.
MILES
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a
wine collection. Very impressive.
STEPHANIE
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this
morning. She said she had a good
time too. You should call her.
Miles says nothing.
STEPHANIE
Where's Jack?
MILES
He had to make a phone call.
Stephanie cuts her bike's engine and climbs off, propping it
up on the kickstand.
STEPHANIE
So what are you up to today, Miles?
MILES
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't
know. Jack and I were supposed to go
golfing.
STEPHANIE
Huh.
MILES
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about
a month ago.
STEPHANIE
Oops. Sorry.
MILES
You golf?
STEPHANIE
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid
game. I mean, at least, I could never
get into it. I tried it once.
MILES
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about
it.
Just then Jack cracks open the motel room door.
JACK
(hushed)
Hey Miles. Miles.
Miles ducks back inside.
Jack bounds out of the room and down the stairs like a child
on Christmas morning.
Miles watches Jack climb on the bike behind Stephanie,
grasping her waist.
Stephanie and Jack PEEL OUT, leaving Miles alone on the
balcony.
CLOSE ON MILES --
As we begin to hear a SNIPPING sound which carries us to --
Miles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails. SNIP,
SNIP, SNIP. MUSIC BEGINS for this mournful montage of
solitude.
Amid turbulent water, Miles corrects his students' papers.
He is alone in the tub, but at the nearby pool STOCKY KIDS
play noisily with SUPER-SOAKERS.
OVER MILES'S SHOULDER --
The PAPER he's reading is marked up with circled spelling
errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out. Finding
a new error, Miles writes "NO!!!"
CAMERA PANS to reveal a STACK of papers already heavily marked
with corrections, some of them mottled with water stains.
A small Buellton eatery.
Miles DRIVES ball after ball, unsuccessfully trying to release
his frustration.
The Saab roars past us, perhaps going a little too fast.
Miles gets out of his car just in time to see --
A DOG
scampering into the nearby woods. Miles looks around -- has
anyone seen him? Is there a nearby residence? Finding nothing,
Miles momentarily weighs his options before finally GIVING
CHASE.
He follows the path of the dog into --
Still hearing occasional distant barking, Miles finds his
way among the trees and bushes, looking in vain for the ill-
fated cur.
After a frenetic search, Miles reluctantly gives up and heads
back.
OMIT.
Miles has returned to where he hit the dog. Just then, Miles
notices TWO MEXICAN CHILDREN watching him from just down the
road. They disappear into the bushes.
Looking like a criminal, Miles trots back to the Saab climbs
behind the wheel and speeds away.
The Saab pulls into the parking lot.
Miles trudges up the stops to the room. He opens the door
and sees --
JACK
atop Stephanie, plowing her fertile fields. Despite the
interruption, their pace does not alter.
JACK
Not now! Not now!
Miles quickly shuts the door.
Miles walks across the parking lot. He pauses before entering,
then forces himself to take the leap.
It's closing time. The front door flies open, and Miles
staggers out sideways. Gary follows him out, concerned.
GARY
You okay, Miles?
MILES
I'm good.
Miles heads in the wrong direction at first, then realizes
his mistake and steers himself back toward the Windmill.
FADE OUT.
UNDER BLACK, A CARD --
WEDNESDAY
WHACK! Jack TEES OFF with a manly athletic swing and shades
his eyes to watch the ball's trajectory.
JACK
Crap.
Miles, disheveled and sullen, approaches the teebox, sticks
a tee in the ground and sets his ball.
JACK
Did you ever got ahold of Maya
yesterday?
MILES
Nope.
JACK
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll
tell you.
MILES
(preparing to swing)
Can you give me some room here?
JACK
(stepping back)
Oh yeah. Sure.
Miles lifts his club.
JACK
You know, in life you gotta strike
when the iron's hot.
MILES
Thanks, Jack.
Miles refocuses and SWINGS just as Jack offers more helpful
advice.
JACK
Don't whiff it.
WHACK! Despite the distraction, Miles manages to make a good,
long drive.
JACK
Nice shot.
MILES
You're an asshole.
NOW ON THE FAIRWAY --
Jack is pouring two Dixie cups of wine as Miles prepares to
take his next swing.
JACK
What about your agent? Hear anything
yet?
MILES
Nope.
JACK
What do you think's going on?
MILES
Could be anything.
JACK
Been checking your messages?
MILES
Obsessively.
JACK
Huh.
MILES
They probably think my book is such
a piece of shit that it's not even
worthy of a response. I guess I'll
just have to learn how to kiss off
three years of my life.
JACK
But you don't know yet, so your
negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't
you say?
Miles says nothing.
JACK
Or fuck those New York publishers.
Publish it yourself. I'll chip in.
Just get it out there, get it
reviewed, get it in libraries. Let
the public decide.
Giving Jack a look that says Jack has no idea what he's
talking about, Miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses.
JACK
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
MILES
Shut up.
JACK
Just trying to be helpful.
(a moment later)
It's all about stillness, Miles.
Inner quiet.
Miles drops his club and turns to Jack.
MILES
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's
the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
JACK
Why are you so hostile? I know you're
frustrated with your life right now,
but you can choose not to be so
hostile.
(holding out a cup of
wine)
Here.
Still fuming, Miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a
taste. He's immediately distracted from his woes.
MILES
What is it?
JACK
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Miles downs the rest and is intrigued by the taste.
MILES
Huh. Let me see the label.
Suddenly a golfball THUDS against the hard fairway directly
behind them.
JACK
(whirling around)
What the fuck?
Way back on the tee box, some 200 yards away, are a FOURSOME
of two couples. One of the MEN is waving his driver.
HUSBAND #1
(shouting, barely
audible)
Hurry it up, will you?
Jack looks at Miles, the two incredulous.
MILES
Fucker hit into us.
JACK
(yelling)
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
MILES
Throw me his ball.
Jack walks over, picks up the offending ball and tosses it
to Miles. Miles gets out his 3-wood and -- THWOCK! -- cuts
it back low and hard.
JACK
Nice shot.
THE COUPLES
duck for cover as the ball whistles over their heads.
JACK AND MILES
laugh hard.
THE TWO HUSBANDS
climb in their CART and hasten down the fairway toward Jack
and Miles.
JACK
watches their approach, grinning.
JACK
Oh, this is going to be fun.
(jerking a driver
from his bag)
This is going to be fun.
Jack heads in their direction, brandishing the club like a
medieval knight with a mace.
As the husbands get a look at this sight, they turn their
cart around and speed back toward their wives.
JACK
Hit into us again, motherfuckers,
and I'll ass-rape all four of you!
Jack and Miles are turning in their cart and hoisting their
clubs over their shoulders.
JACK
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool
smart chicks like that --they like
persistence.
MILES
I don't want to talk about it.
JACK
All I know is she's beautiful. Lots
of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not
going to feel good about this trip
until you guys hook up. Don't you
just want to feel that cozy little
box grip down on your Johnson?
Nearby a GOLFER is with his YOUNG SON.
GOLFER
Hey, you mind keeping it down, buddy?
Miles and Jack walk toward their car.
JACK
Is it the money thing?
MILES
Is what the money thing?
JACK
With Maya.
MILES
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman
finds out how I live, that I'm not a
published author, that I'm a liar
essentially, then yeah, any interest
is gonna evaporate real quick. If
you don't have money at my age, you're
not even in the game. You're just a
pasture animal waiting for the
abattoir.
JACK
Is an abattoir like a... like a...
what is that?
MILES
Slaughterhouse.
JACK
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to
get the good news this week about
your book. I know you are. I can
feel it.
Jack's CELLPHONE rings, and he checks the caller ID.
JACK
It's Steph.
(picking up)
Hey, baby. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yesssss. I
mean I would, but let me see. Hey,
Miles... Oh fuck it, we're going.
We'll be right there. Me too.
He snaps his phone shut and turns to Miles.
JACK
We're on.
MILES
What's happening?
JACK
We're going to have some fun. Remember
fun? We're going to have some of it.
Okay?
MILES
What exactly are we going to do?
JACK
I said okay?
MILES
You have to tell me --
JACK
I SAID OKAY?
Miles finally smiles.
MILES
Okay.
OMITTED
BIG FUN MUSIC BEGINS OVER:
A HIGH WIDE SHOT --
The Saab pulls up where Stephanie and Maya await with bottles
of wine and a PICNIC BASKET. The girls climb into the back
seat, and the car speeds away.
They're going FAST, hair whipping around.
MAYA
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the
restaurant last night looking for
me.
MILES
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped
by for a drink. Didn't see you.
MAYA
I had class.
MILES
Well, nice to see you now.
MAYA
You too.
WHOOSH! That car's going a little too FAST!
The two couples wander around this historic site.
The girls have led them to a beautiful spot.
IN A SERIES OF SHOTS --
we see the progress of their picnic. We don't hear them, but
there is a growing intimacy about their interaction. Even
Maya and Miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness
from the other night. Jack and Stephanie lean on each other
as they eat and sip wine.
Finally, the two couples are SILHOUETTED against the SUNSET.
The parking lot is crowded. The foursome join others headed
toward the main building.
The Saab pulls away from the house.
Maya leads Miles up her back stairway. They're both a little
woozy from the hours of drinking.
AT THE DOOR --
Maya searches through her purse for her keys while Miles
hovers directly behind her, staring at her ear. Her ear?
Just as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans
forward to kiss the nape of her neck. Maya's reaction is
immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long
KISS. Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes
the door in our face.
The camera PANS to the nearby ROOFTOPS.
MUSIC ENDS AND SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
THE SAME VIEW BY DAY, SUPERIMPOSED WITH --
THURSDAY
The CAMERA PANS back to Maya's door, tilting down to find a
blue-wrapped NEW YORK TIMES. The door opens, and Maya's hand
picks up the newspaper. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Maya inside to --
This is a weekly event in a big PARKING LOT -- organic
produce, candles and incense, honey and cider.
Maya and Miles are shopping. Miles carries the bags.
Across from each other at a PICNIC TABLE, and surrounded by
the remnants of BREAKFAST, Miles and Maya read the NEWSPAPER.
Miles is doing the CROSSWORD PUZZLE.
MAYA
You guys should stop by the restaurant
for lunch today.
MILES
Great. What's the latest we can get
there?
MAYA
About two-thirty.
MILES
Okay.
MAYA
(noticing)
Did you hear about this Bordeaux
tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara
Saturday night? It's a little pricey,
but if you wanted to go, I'd be into
it. Why don't you stay through the
weekend?
Miles has just figured out a difficult clue. As he writes it
down --
MILES
No, we've got to get back Friday for
the rehearsal dinner.
MAYA
What rehearsal dinner?
Miles stops writing.
MAYA
Who's getting married?
Maya leads the way toward the Saab.
MAYA
Were you ever going to say anything?
MILES
Of course I was. I mean, just now I
could have made up some story, but I
didn't. I told you the truth.
Maya turns to confront Miles with a look of "Give me a break."
Miles reaches out to touch her.
MILES
Maya.
MAYA
(jerking away)
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
Miles brings the car to a stop. Maya opens the door and begins
to get out.
MAYA
You know, I just spent three years
trying to extricate myself from a
relationship that turned out to be
full of deception. And I've been
doing just fine.
MILES
And I haven't been with anyone since
my divorce. This has been a big deal
for me, Maya -- hanging out with
you, and last night. I really like
you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm
just his... his freshman roommate
from San Diego State.
Maya wants to let Miles's words reach her, but she can't
just yet.
MAYA
Could I have my paper, please?
Unsure what she wants at first, Miles reaches into the back
seat for the New York Times. He hands it to her and watches
until she goes inside.
Miles pulls up and parks.
Miles is slumped in the passenger seat as Jack drives. They
pass a BIG COMMERCIAL WINERY. Jack slows down, preparing to
turn in.
JACK
How about this one? We didn't hit
this one.
MILES
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
JACK
You ever actually been in there,
Miles?
MILES
I don't have to.
JACK
(turning the wheel)
I say we check it out. You never
know.
The Saab finds a place in the large parking lot. A TOUR BUS,
whose flank reads "Solvang Wine Tours," is in the process of
letting out WINE TOURISTS, many of them elderly.
Walking across the lawn outside, Miles holds the cellphone
to his ear.
ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE)
Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.
MILES
Hi, it's Miles.
ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE)
Oh, hi, Miles. Let me see if I can
get her.
(a moment later)
You're in luck. I'll put you through.
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
Miles.
MILES
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite
client.
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
How's the trip?
MILES
Good, good. Drinking some good wines
and kicking back, you know. So what's
happening? Still no word?
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
Actually there is word. I spoke to
Keith Kurtzman this morning.
MILES
And?
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
And... they're passing. Conundrum's
passing. He said they really liked
it. They really wanted to do it, but
they just couldn't figure out how to
market it. He said it was a tough
call.
MILES
Huh.
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
I'm sorry, Miles.
(off his silence)
So I don't know where that leaves
us. I'm not sure how much more mileage
I can get out of continuing to submit
it. I think it's one of those
unfortunate cases in the business
right now -- a fabulous book with no
home. The whole industry's gotten
gutless. It's not about the quality
of the books. It's about the
marketing.
Miles is at a loss for words. A distant RUMBLE begins to
sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack.
Once again we see the narrow ROPE BRIDGE extending
vertiginously across a great CHASM.
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
Are you there? Miles?
MILES
Yeah, I'm here.
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could.
You've been a real trooper.
(loudly, to her
assistant)
Tell him I'll call back.
MILES
So I guess that's it.
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
You're a wonderful writer, Miles.
Don't be discouraged.
MOMENTS LATER --
Miles STAGGERS toward the tasting room, unpocketing his Xanax
and downing a couple, as Evelyn's clichs of consolation
continue in his head.
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
Just hang in there, and who knows?
After you get something else
published, we can revisit this one.
And next time we can try a different
title.
Once back at the tent, he leans against it in a vain attempt
to steady himself. The RUMBLE grows deafening.
Two PELICANS soar low over the water. One of the DIVES,
crashing into the water and disappearing from view.
Jack and Miles sit on the hood of the Saab, gazing at the
ocean, sharing a bottle of wine.
JACK
Just write another one. You have
lots of ideas, right?
MILES
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer.
I'm a middle-school English teacher.
I'm going to spend the rest of my
life grading essays and reading the
works of others. It's okay. I like
books. The world doesn't give a shit
what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.
(a dark laugh)
I'm so insignificant, I can't even
kill myself.
JACK
What's that supposed to mean?
MILES
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf,
Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't
kill yourself before you've even
been published.
JACK
What about that guy who wrote
Confederacy of Dunces? He committed
suicide before he got published, and
look how famous he is.
MILES
Thanks.
JACK
Don't give up. You're going to make
it.
MILES
Half my life is over, and I have
nothing to show for it. I'm a
thumbprint on the window of a
skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement
on a tissue surging out to sea with
a million tons of raw sewage.
JACK
See? Right there. Just what you just
said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint
on a skyscraper. I couldn't write
that.
MILES
Neither could I. I think it's
Bukowski.
Unable to respond, Jack looks up and down the beach.
ZOOM! There goes the Saab.
The CAMERA lingers behind and PANS to reveal THE DEAD DOG,
now covered with FLIES AND MAGGOTS.
Jack and Miles pull into the parking lot.
JACK
(lighting up)
Oh, look. There's Steph!
He smiles broadly and honks his horn. Miles turns to see --
STEPHANIE
seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her HELMET in her
lap, watching patiently as --
THE SAAB
pulls to a stop in a parking space.
Miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches
in the backseat for his Sears bag.
JACK
(calling out)
Hey, baby.
Stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as Jack
reaches into the trunk and pulls out a BIG CUDDLY LION DOLL.
JACK
Look what I got for our favorite
girl.
Stephanie walks toward Jack as he waddles toward her hugging
the lion. When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms
with rage.
STEPHANIE
YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
She swings her helmet and HITS JACK FULL IN THE FACE.
Jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. Stephanie stands
over him and continues to BEAT HIM with her helmet as he
rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed
lion.
Miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out
of range.
MILES
Stephanie! Stop!
STEPHANIE
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of
shit! You're getting married on
Saturday? What was all that shit you
said to me?
JACK
I can explain.
STEPHANIE
You said you loved me! You fuck! I
hope you die!
With that she backs away. Glancing at her bloodied helmet,
she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike.
STEPHANIE
Fuckface!
(to Miles)
You too!
As she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded
friend. The lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky.
Seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses
a BLOOD-SOAKED TOWEL against his face.
MILES
Aren't you glad you didn't move up
here and marry her?
JACK
Don't need a lecture. You fucking
told Maya, didn't you?
MILES
No, I did not. Must have been Gary
at the Hitching Post. I think we
mentioned it to him the first night.
JACK
You told him. I'm fucking hurting
here.
MILES
Keep it elevated.
Jack sits in the Saab's passenger side with the seat almost
fully reclined. When his agony allows him to open his eyes,
he glares at the DANISH THEMED STORES lining the street. An
ABELSKIVER MAKER plies his lofty trade in a nearby window.
He hears a strange CLOMPING NOISE and turns his head to see
a MAN IN WOODEN CLOGS walking noisily down the street, dressed
in a TRADITIONAL DANISH COSTUME and carrying a TUBA. Jack
takes a slug of wine.
Just then Miles gets back in the car.
JACK
I hate this place.
Miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills.
A closer angle reveals them as VICODIN.
MILES
Take a couple of these, and you'll
learn to love it.
Miles opens the bottle and hands Jack two PILLS.
MILES
Two for you. And two for me.
Jack washes down the pills and passes the bottle to Miles,
who follows suit.
Jack and Miles sit across from each other. For the first
time we see LARGE PURPLE BRUISES on Jack's arms and chest.
JACK
So how did Stephanie know it was
Saturday? We didn't get into that
with Gary.
MILES
Huh. Let me think.
JACK
You sure you didn't say anything to
Maya?
MILES
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you
implying? I'm really pissed off at
you about all this, if you want to
know the truth. What's Maya going to
think of me now just for associating
with you? You're the one who's
sabotaging me, not the other way
around, pal. Not by a longshot.
Jack takes a long lie-detecting look at Miles.
JACK
I don't know. Just seems fishy.
Establishing. Thursday night is Cajun Wings Night.
Miles drives in the early-morning light. Jack is now subdued,
quieted by his pain and exhaustion.
MILES
She tell you she was married?
JACK
Yeah.
MILES
So what the fuck were you thinking?
JACK
Wasn't supposed to be back till six.
Fucker rolls in at five.
MILES
Cutting it a little close, don't you
think?
(off Jack's silence)
So how was she? Compared to Stephanie,
say.
JACK
Horny as shit. Flopping around like
a landed trout.
The Saab creeps around a corner.
Jack scans the street.
JACK
Yeah, this is the block. Just keep
going...
(spotting an AMC Pacer)
Yeah! This is it. There's her car.
Miles pulls over and cuts the engine.
MILES
So what's the plan?
JACK
The plan is... you go.
MILES
Me?
JACK
My ankle. Just go explain the
situation.
MILES
(sarcastic, clearing
his throat)
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend
was the one balling your wife a couple
hours ago, and he seems to have left
his wallet behind, and we were
wondering...
JACK
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like
that.
Miles gives Jack a withering look. Jack reaches for the DOOR
HANDLE.
JACK
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
MILES
(grabbing Jack's shirt)
Hold on.
Miles crosses the street and approaches --
Miles presses his ear against the front door. Nothing. Then
he notices --
A SLIDING GLASS DOOR a few feet away, just barely cracked
open.
MILES creeps over, sticks his hand into the open space and
pulls back the curtain to reveal --
A LIVING ROOM the is hideously MESSY. Draped over a deformed
beanbag chair are JACK'S LEVI'S.
Miles gathers his courage, carefully slides open the glass
door, and creeps inside.
Miles comes flying out of the sliding glass door, followed
swiftly by the man, who is of course STARK NAKED. And he's
fast for a man his size.
CAMMI (O.S.)
Get him!
The Saab enters the freeway and heads south.
Miles drives while Jack stares out the window, WATCHING THE
LANDSCAPE CHANGE as they leave wine country.
MILES
Hey, Jack. Jack.
JACK
Hrnrnrn?
MILES
That was quite a day yesterday.
Jack's eyes close, but his lips spread into a smile.
JACK
Yep. Quite a day.
MILES
Quite a week.
A driving shot.
Miles pumps the gas, while nearby Jack stretches his legs.
As Miles puts the nozzle back in place --
JACK
Want me to drive?
MILES
No, I'm okay.
JACK
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to
the wedding?
MILES
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya
to your wedding is the right move.
In fact, after your bullshit, it's
going to be hard for me to even go
to the Hitching Post again.
JACK
You're so negative.
Miles replaces the hose and screws on the gas cap.
JACK
Come on, let me drive.
MILES
I'm fine. You rest.
JACK
I feel like driving.
The Saab plows INTO A TREE.
They get out to inspect the damage. The hood is slightly
crumpled, and the front fender is bent.
MILES
Look at this!
JACK
I don't know. Doesn't look like
anybody got hurt in this one.
MILES
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
JACK
You need a new car anyway.
Miles looks at his friend, incredulous.
JACK
I said I'd pay for it.
MOMENTS LATER --
The trunk is open, and the guys are unloading their cases of
wine. Miles notices that one box is DRIPPING.
MILES
You broke some.
JACK
Whatever. Sorry.
MILES
No, not whatever. You fucking
derelict.
MOMENTS LATER --
Miles looks on as Jack hoists a FOUNDATION BLOCK toward the
open driver's door of the Saab.
JACK
You ready?
Miles waves his hand in a gesture of "Get it over with."
Grunting with effort, Jack leans inside the car and drops
the foundation block onto the GAS PEDAL.
Direct hit! Jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in
time.
Miles and Jack watch the driverless Saab race toward the
tree, its speed increasing. But just before hitting it, the
car drifts to one side and SAILS RIGHT PAST.
MILES
Oh, fuck!
The car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the
tree, continues on until CRASHING THROUGH A FENCE and finally
toppling headlong into a CEMENT TRENCH. Only the back of the
car remains visible.
The whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds. Still
frozen in place, Miles and Jack turn slowly to each other.
JACK
It's okay. I've got Triple A.
From in front of the Saab, we see its now CRUMPLED HOOD and
FENDER, a couple of BUNGEE CORDS holding the whole thing
together.
The Saab approaches the end of the line.
AT THE FRONT PORCH --
Miles has helped Jack carry his bags and the wine. He plops
the last case down.
MILES
Well. That about does it.
JACK
Why don't you come in?
MILES
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
JACK
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
MILES
Yeah.
They give each other a brief manly back-slappy hug.
JACK
Love you, man.
MILES
Back at you.
Miles heads toward the curb.
JACK
Hey, don't pull away till they see
the car.
MILES
(over his shoulder)
Yeah.
(turning around)
Hey, why wasn't I injured?
JACK
(big smile)
You were wearing your belt.
BACK AT HIS CAR --
Miles gets in and watches through the side window as Mrs.
Erganian opens the front door and welcomes Jack with shock
and dismay. Jack points back at --
MILES raising one hand in a feeble wave. The camera slowly
MOVES CLOSER as he continues to watch --
JACK --
weaving his story of woe. He's a great actor when he wants
to be. Mr. Erganian and a mortified Christine come to the
door too. Mr. Erganian takes a few steps toward the car to
get a better look.
VERY CLOSE ON MILES --
watching the drama play out. Then his eyes drop as he
momentarily loses himself in melancholy. This reverie is
interrupted by --
THE VOICE OF AN ARMENIAN PRIEST
Startled, Miles turns to look at --
A PRIEST
who is singing the BLESSING OF THE RINGS.
We are now in --
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS --
The WEDDING FAMILIES greet the exiting guests in a RECEIVING
LINE. Smiling and exuberant, Jack seems utterly at home as
the new groom.
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS --
Miles watches the scene, not without melancholy. Then --
VICTORIA (O.S.)
Hey, Miles.
Miles turns and looks up to see Victoria, standing one step
above him. Just behind her is her NEW HUSBAND. He exudes the
quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played
college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing
vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school.
MILES
Hi, Vicki.
(taking her in)
You look beautiful.
VICTORIA
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my
husband.
From his spot hovering over Miles, Ken leans down and offers
his hand.
KEN
How are you?
MILES
Hi. How you doing? You're a lucky
guy.
KEN
Thanks.
(to Victoria)
I'll wait for you at the car.
(to Miles)
Nice to meet you, Miles.
MILES
Ken.
Exit Ken.
MILES
That was big of him.
VICTORIA
Yeah, he's good that way. Very
considerate.
MILES
That's great.
VICTORIA
So how're you doing?
MILES
Since the last time we spoke? I don't
know. Could be better. Could be worse.
VICTORIA
So what's happening with your book?
MILES
Universally rejected. Strike three.
VICTORIA
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are
you going to do?
MILES
Back to the drawing board, I guess.
Or not. So... you're married.
Congratulations. You look happy.
VICTORIA
I am.
MILES
Seems like everyone's getting married.
A year ago it was all divorces. Now
it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
VICTORIA
I guess.
Just then a BLACK LINCOLN NAVIGATOR pulls up alongside the
curb. The passenger side window is halfway down, and the
sounds of Adult Contemporary Jazz waft out. Victoria gives
Ken a little wave.
MILES
(shifting gears)
Well, let's go have some champagne,
shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
VICTORIA
Not me. I'm not drinking.
MILES
You quit drinking?
VICTORIA
I'm pregnant.
MILES
(hit in the solar
plexus)
Oh. Huh. Well...
(rallying)
Congratulations again, Vicki. That's
wonderful news.
VICTORIA
(going to the car)
See you over there, Miles.
MILES
Yeah.
As she gets in the car and cruises away, Miles glances back
at --
THE RECEIVING LINE
-- where Mike Erganian is introducing Jack to some dear old
FRIENDS. Mike throws a loving arm around his new son-in-law,
and Jack is drawn into Mike's bosom.
A HAND-PAINTED SIGN, attached to a STOP SIGH and decorated
with balloons, reads: "RECEPTION THIS WAY!" with an arrow
pointing RIGHT.
One by one, CARS are making a right turn. But when his turn
comes, Miles turns LEFT.
The Saab pull up outside. Miles leaves the car idling as he
sprints inside. Moments later he sprints back to his car,
this time carrying SOMETHING.
OMIT
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --
We see ourselves taking the BUELLTON EXIT.
MAYA'S VOICE
Anyway, it's turned cold and rainy
here lately. But I like winter. So
listen, if you ever do decide to
come up here again, you should let
me know. I would say stop by the
Hitching Post, but to tell you the
truth I'm not sure how much longer
I'm going to be working there. I'm
going to graduate soon so I'll
probably relocate. We'll see.
Miles climbs the wooden steps and approaches Maya's back
door.
MAYA'S VOICE
Anyway, like I said, I really loved
your novel. Don't give up, Miles.
Keep writing. You're really good.
Hope you're well. Bye.
Miles takes a breath. Finally he KNOCKS.
FADE OUT.
THE END
