      COLD OPEN

      A COMPUTER SCREEN.    

      FF shot of the homepage of Gush, a fictional website modeled 
      on The Huffington Post. The banner headline reads  This Is 
      Our Youth? . The subheadline reads  Unpaid Interns Launch 
      Uncertain Future at Gush . Between these two are photos of 
      the people we ll soon know as KATE, JOSH, GABE and PRUDENCE. 

      An iMac-style cursor clicks on the headline. After a second 
      the  article  page of the story appears with a video box. The 
      cursor clicks on the  play  button, then the  full frame  
        corner-box. Video fills the screen:

      EXT. ASTORIA, QUEENS - MORNING

        ESTABLISHING SHOTS OF AN ORDINARY SEPTEMBER MONDAY MORNING. 
      KATE, 22, ATTRACTIVE, NEUROTIC, CASUALLY DRESSED, WALKS OUT 
      OF HER APARTMENT BUILDING DOOR ONTO THE STREET, WEARING 
      EARPHONES. DISNEYESQUE MUSIC BEGINS WHEN SHE CLOSES THE DOOR; 
      THOUGH LOUD, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT S COMING FROM HER EARPHONES. 
      SHE SINGS TO THE CAMERA, MUSICAL-THEATERY OVER-THE-TOP CHEERY 
      AT FIRST, BUT QUICKLY LOSING CONFIDENCE.

                                    KATE
                      Hello, Monday morning!
                    Oh, how wonderful you feel!
                      You re just like me: you re breezy, 
                      bright, and sunny!
                    And although I may be slightly stressed, 
                    And my heart is pounding in my chest,
                    And I got four hours of sleep at best, 
                    And I'm either manic or depressed,
                    And I'm overwhelmed and underdressed...
                          (The music ends awkwardly. 
                            She looks at herself)
                        Under-underdressed, actually. Like, 
                    slut.
                          (Looks at her chest)
                      Aaaand I m nippin  out. So dumb 
                    slut.
                          (Turns around, walks away)
                      Headlights on and nobody home.
                          (Keeps walking away)
                      I should not be trusted with me.

      SHE KEEPS WALKING FOR AN AWKWARD SECOND.    BROWSERS - 10/25/122

      THE EXACT SAME ESTABLISHING SHOTS. ONCE AGAIN KATE EMERGES, 
      THIS TIME IN DRESSIER CLOTHES, AND TO LESS DISNEYESQUE, 
       REALER  MUSIC THAT SOUNDS MUCH FULLER. NO ONE ELSE NOTICES 
      HER OR EXPRESSES AWARENESS THAT SHE S SINGING AS SHE WALKS.

                                    KATE
                      Hello, Monday morning.

                    But for now, I'm gonna fake it after all!    BROWSERS - 10/25/123


      Excited, she takes off her earphones and flips them into the

                      I think that s how I got hired.

                                    JOSH
                      Right.

      KATE LOOKS EMBARRASSED.

                    She s one of my culture heroes. So 
                    cool, so no-bullshit, and so pro-
                    gay. 

                                    KATE
                      Didn t she marry a gay guy once?

                                    GABE
                      Soooo pro-gay. 

                                    JOSH
                      Although she s been married like, 
                    ten times, so the odds are that one 
                    of them would be, right?

      INT. - CONFERENCE ROOM

      JUSTIN TALKS. THE INTERNS SIT AROUND A COFFEE TABLE.

                                    JUSTIN
                    Less than a year ago, I was sitting 
                      exactly where you re sitting, 
                      although we ve since replaced the 
                      chairs. I started out as an intern. 
                    Today I am among the five highest-
                      ranking of Julianna s six executive 
                      assistants. I m proof that here at 
                    Gush, talent at any level is 
                      noticed and rewarded. Having said 
                    that, I now need to discuss 
                       Winnowing Week.  

                                    GABE
                      Winnowing week?

                                    JUSTIN
                            (Uncomfortably)
                    So what we do, it s kind of a 
                      hallowed tradition,  Winnowing 
                      Week , each new crop of interns, by 
                    the end of the first week, so, 
                      whichever one is not working out 
                    the most, gets fired. Basically.

                                    GABE
                      Fired?

                                    JUSTIN
                    Well, I guess  fired  is when you 
                    get rid of someone you re actually 
                      paying.  Let go.  But um... yeah. 

                                    GABE
                    No.

                                    JUSTIN
                    Look, Julianna believes the 
                      business world can be profoundly 
                      unfair, and her management style, 
                    you know, reflects that. 

                                    JOSH
                    On what basis are we judged?

                                    JUSTIN
                    Just your overall performance this 
                    week in the things we ask you to 
                    do. It s fair. In that regard.

                                    JUSTIN
                    Yes I did. We had six interns. They 
                    fired a guy named Evan. Last I 
                    heard he was working at a Quizno s.

                    don t know what the hell that is. 
                    It s a beast, and feeding that 
                    beast takes a lot of material, and 
                    that takes a lot of coffee runs and 
                    a lot of browsing...

                    And both of those are where you 
                    come in. A lot of what we'll be 
                      asking you to do is search the web 
                    for stuff we can repurpose.

                    No, repurpose. In fact around here 
                    we like to think of the stuff we 
                    find as pre-purposed. By the end of 
                    the day I want a list of forty 
                    links we would have never found 
                      without you. Quirky, heartbreaking, 
                      scandalous, heroic, tragic... all 
                    that good stuff.

                      something to think about for the

                    last week at Occupy Tahiti.

                    Isn t that old news?

                    Not on Tahiti, I guess. Check it

                    Yes. Congratulations, you three.
                          (To AMY)
                    So. Do you want to reschedule, or 
                    can you talk wet?

                                  AMY
                    Can we reschedule? I m a little 
                      flustered by all the incivility 
                    right now.

                    Of course. Justin will work it out. 
                    Let me walk you out, darling.

                    Gabe, sorry. Usually it s not  til

                                    GABE
                    No! I just said I disagreed with 
                    her views.

                                    KATE

      KATE PITIES GABE. SHE LOOKS UP AT JULIANNA S CLOSED DOOR. 
      IT S 50 FEET AWAY BUT SEEMS LIKE A MILE. SHE SIGHS IN 
        RESIGNATION AND STANDS UP. SHE BEGINS SINGING, AND MOVING 
      SMOOTHLY TOWARD THE DOOR. WE SOON SEE WHY: ANOTHER KATE IS 
      PUSHING HER TOWARDS IT, ONE WHO LOOKS THE SAME AS KATE BUT 
      FUNCTIONS AS HER CONSCIENCE. THEIR SONG IS A  DUET.

                    Right now, I just want out of life,  
                      period.

                                    JULIANNA
                    When I was 22 I had no idea who I 
                    was or what I wanted. I was adrift 
                    on the tides of life. One day I was 
                      laying out tanning on a beach in 
                    the Cypriot village of Geriskipou
                    when I saw a man - a very big, 
                    scary man - hitting his wife. 
                      Hitting her very hard. She was 
                      weeping. There was no one else 
                      there, no one to stop him. And at a 
                      certain pointed turned and looked 
                    at me and... grimaced. "What are 
                    you going to do about it, little 
                      lady?" Now, I am not equating 
                      domestic abuse with winnowing new 
                      employees, a successful team-
                      building technique that dates all 
                    the way back to The Art of War. 
                    Have you read that?
                          (KATE shakes her head)
                    I'll send you the app. Nor am I 
                      saying that coming into my office 
                    and speaking up for a friend is the 
                    same as having your uncle throttle 
                    a man and then drown him in a 
                      fishing net.

                                    KATE
                      That's what you did?

                    I'm not saying that either. My 
                    point is your action, while 
                      betraying both na vet  and 
                      stupidity, is not dissimilar to the

                    No. Because it makes me realize I'm 
                    old enough to have young woman 
                      remind me of myself at their age.

                    Yeah.

      THEY EXCHANGE A GLANCE. IT'S CLEARLY A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT.

      INT. - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

      JULIANNA IS COVERTLY WATCHING JUSTIN AND KATE THROUGH HER 
      SHADES. SHE SMILES TO HERSELF AND WALKS OVER TO A PICTURE OF 
      HERSELF A BEGINS TO WRITE SOMETHING, THEN STOPS, THOUGHTFUL. 
      SHE BEGINS TO SING.

                                    JULIANNA 
                    When I'm asked how I got so 
                      successful,
                      I just smile and say "Hard work and 
                      luck".
                    But that's not what it was; it was 
                      really because
                    I am someone with whom not to fuck.

      THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS FROM HER TO HER WALL, WHICH IS LINED 
      WITH PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER WITH CELEBRITIES.

                                    JULIANNA (V.O.)
                    I am smart, but I'm hardly a 
                      genius.
                    And I can't say I'm good with a 
                    buck.
                    But throughout my career it's been 
                      painfully clear
                    That I'm someone with whom not to 
                    fuck.

      WE DISSOLVE INTO VARIOUS SHOTS OF JULIANNA DEBATING PUNDITS 
      ON TV. WE DON T HEAR WHAT SHE S SAYING, BUT HER ADVERSARIES 
      APPEAR HUMILIATED.

                                    JULIANNA (V.O.)
                    I'm someone who makes up new rules 
                    every day,
                    Rules everyone else is then stuck 
                    with.
                    For instance, the rule that it 
                      sounds d class 
                    To say "I'm someone not to fuck
                      with."    BROWSERS - 10/25/1235


      SHOTS OF JULIANNA AROUND THE OFFICE. SHE IS CHARMING AND 
      SMILING IN ONE SCENE, SCREAMING AND YELLING THE NEXT. SHE 
      APPEARS TO HAVE THE ENTIRE GAMUT OF HUMAN EMOTIONS ARE HER 
      DISPOSAL.

                                    JULIANNA (V.O.)
                    It's a huge operation I'm running,
                    And I keep it from running amok
                    By making it known to both bigwig 
                    and drone
                    That I'm someone with whom not to 
                    fuck.

      AN INSTRUMENTAL BREAK IN WHICH WE SEE GABE RETURNING TO THE 
      BULLPEN AREA WITH JUSTIN. HE IS GREETED BY PRUDENCE AND JOSH 
      AND GIVES KATE A BIG HUG. WE CUT AWAY TO A SHOT OF CASSIE RE-
      WATCHING THE CLIP THAT JOSH SUBMITTED. SHE SIGHS AND GIVES A 
       MAYBE IT S NOT SO BAD  GESTURE.

                                    VICKY
                            (Loudly)
                    Hey, um... Josh?

      CUT TO A VERY, VERY SLOW CLOSE-UP OF AN UNHAPPY 23-YEAR-OLD 
      WORKING BEHIND THE COUNTER AT QUIZNO S. HE HAS A NAMETAG THAT 
      SAYS  EVAN . HE STARES FORLORNLY AT THE CAMERA.

                                    JULIANNA (V.O.)
                    It's nothing I want people 
                      stressing about.
                    In fact, people's stress level 
                    falls off
                    As soon as they're free of the 
                      burden of doubt
                    As to whether I might cut their 
                    balls off.

      WE FINALLY COME BACK  LIVE  TO JULIANNA, WHO IS DOING YOGA ON 
      A MAT IN HER OFFICE. HER EYES ARE CLOSED. SHE IS IN AN 
      IMPRESSIVE STRETCH POSITION. SHE SINGS.

                    But for now, I'm content to do yoga
                    And serenely await the next schmuck
                    Who walks in my room
                    And brings on his doom
                    By being naive enough not to assume
                    I'm someone with whom...
                          (Opens her eyes, looks at 
                            camera)
                    Not to fuck.

      SHE SMILES. THE SONG ENDS.     BROWSERS - 10/25/1236


      AS THE MUSIC OF THE OPENING SONG BEGINS WE DISSOLVE TO THE 
      FOUR NEW INTERNS TALKING TO EACH OTHER ON THE ELEVATOR AT THE 
      END OF THE DAY. THEY HAVE CLEARLY BONDED. THEY WALK OUT THE 
      DOOR; EVERYONE BUT GABE GOES ONE WAY; GABE WAVES GOODBYE AND 
      BEGINS WALKING DOWN THE STREET; HE SINGS.

                                    GABE
                    This is my life
                    And I very nearly blew it.

      PRUDENCE SITS AT A TABLE AT QUIZNO S EATING A SANDWICH. 

                                    PRUDENCE
                    This is my life,
                    And I'm glad I'm passing through it.

      JOSH IS IN BACK IN HIS BEDROOM ON HIS COMPUTER, WATCHING THE 
      BARE MINIMUM VIDEO ON GUSH, SMILING. HE  THINK-SINGS .

                                    JOSH
                    That is my life!
                      That s it right there
                    On the site - there,
                      That s my link!

      FINALLY, KATE RETURNS TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE APARTMENT 
      BUILDING WE SAW HER LEAVE AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW. 

                                    KATE
                    For a first day...

      SHE THINKS FOR A MOMENT. WE SEE A VERY BRIEF MEMORY SHOT OF 
      JUSTIN FROM HIS LAST CONVERSATION WITH HER. SHE SMILES.

                                    KATE
                      There s potential, I think.

      SHE TURNS THE KEY AND WALKS IN. HER IMAGE STOPS, AS AT THE 
      END OF A MOVIE PLAYED BACK ON YOUTUBE. THE CURSOR OF GOD 
      REAPPEARS AND CLICKS THE  X  BUTTON IN THE TOP RIGHT. THE 
      IMAGE DISAPPEARS.
