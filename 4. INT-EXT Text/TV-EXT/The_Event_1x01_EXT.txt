      Mark and Sean load the bags into the trunk of Mark s BMW 
      while Leila kisses her mother and sister good-bye.

                                  LEILA
                          (to Samantha)
                    I m counting on you to keep an eye 
                    on mom and dad until I get back, 
                    okay, Shorty?

                                  SAMANTHA
                    I ll do what I can.  Bye!
                          (getting into Karen s SUV)
                    Mom, we re gonna be late for school.

                                  KAREN
                    Leila, honey, you be careful, okay?

                                  LEILA
                    Mom, we re just going on a cruise.

                                  KAREN
                    I know, but you kids always go do 
                    all these crazy things, the scuba 
                    diving, and the rock climbing...  I 
                    just don t want you to go break 
                    your neck.  Or anything, actually.  
                    Just don t break anything!

                                  LEILA
                      I promise.

                                  MARK
                          (slams the trunk shut)
                    Okay, kids, we re off!

      Mark, Leila and Sean get into the BMW, Karen and Samantha get 
      into the SUV.  Ad-lib good-byes.  The SUV is first to pull 
      out of the parking lot.  Samantha waves good-bye.  Leila 
      waves back from the front seat of the BMW.

      INSIDE THE BMW

                                  MARK (CONT D)
                    Okay, sure you have everything?

      He adjusts the rear-view mirror, peeks at Sean in the back.                                                                                      7.

                                  MARK (CONT D)
                          (smirking, with a wink)
                    Sean?

      Sean realizes Mark is hinting at the engagement ring. 

                                  SEAN
                    Yes, sir!

                                  MARK
                    Okay, then... Cleared for departure!

      ON THE BMW

      -- as it pulls out of the parking lot and drives past a BLACK 
      VAN parked across the street.  Tinted windows.  Ominous.

      The van s engine comes on.  It merges into traffic like a 
      shark tailing its prey.  The SOUND OF TRAFFIC grows LOUDER as 
      the van DRIVES BY and FILLS THE SCREEN as we--

                                                  END FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT TO:


      TIGHT ON A RED LIGHT

      We PAN/TILT TO REVEAL several cars waiting for the light to 
      turn green.  Palm trees, bright Art Deco buildings, glass 
      skyscrapers slashing through the bright blue sky.

      The DRIVER of an old Volvo taps his steering wheel to the 
      beat of his blaring radio.  The light finally turns green.  
      The man moves into first gear, starts pulling forward when--

      A BLACK SUV

      -- careens through the intersection, ignoring the red light  
      and BLASTING ITS HORN.  The stunned Volvo driver smashes on 
      his brakes.  THE SUV swerves to avoid the collision and 
      speeds down the street.

      INSIDE THE SUV

      SIMON LEE, mid-30 s, athletic, rugged.  Hasn t shaved in a 
      couple of days.  Hasn t had time.  He s a man on a mission 
      and he s running out of time.  

                                  SIMON
                          (into his cell phone)
                    There is no time.  You need to 
                    ground that plane right now, you 
                      understand?

                OPERATOR (V.O.)SIMON*
        (on the phone)And do not put me on hold 
      I m gonna have to put you on again.
      hold.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Hello?

       The Girl from Ipanema  starts playing on the other end.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Oh, come on!

      He SMACKS his phone against the steering wheel.  Then takes a 
      deep breath, glances at the dashboard clock.

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:                                                                                      9.


      Simon, still on the phone with the control tower, is now 
      SWERVING through freeway traffic.  Cars move out of his way, 
      honking angrily.

                                  SIMON
                    For god s sake, Fred, just do it!

      INTERCUT WITH CONTROL TOWER

                                  DAVIS
                    Okay, fine.  Stay on the line.

      Davis looks up at the controllers in the room.

                                  DAVIS (CONT'D)
                          (calling out)
                    Who s got SkyAir 514?

                                  KRAMER
                    Right here, boss.  I have SkyAir 
                    514 taxiing onto Charlie Five.                                                                                    14.

                                  DAVIS
                    Bring her back to the gate.

                                  KRAMER
                    Yes, sir.
                          (into headset)
                    SkyAir 514, your take off clearance 
                    is canceled. Taxi off runway Charlie

                    Okay, they re grounded.  Now who 
                    are you and what do you want?

      ON KRAMER

      -- still waiting for an answer from flight 514.

                                  KRAMER
                    SkyAir 514, take off clearance 
                      cancelled.  Taxi off runway Charlie

      ON DAVIS

                                  DAVIS
                          (into phone)
                    We re tracing your call right now, 
                    so if you don t--

                                  SIMON
                    No, you re not.

                                  KRAMER
                          (calling out Davis)
                    Sir, SkyAir 514 has gone norco.  
                    I m getting no response.

                                  DAVIS
                    What?

      Davis walks to the window, looks down at the runway.  RACK 
      FOCUS TO THE BOEING maneuvering into take off position. 

                                  DAVIS (CONT D)
                          (tensing up, to Simon)
                    We lost radio contact.  What s 
                    going on?                                                                                    15.


                                  SIMON
                    Dammit!  It s too late.

      He hangs up his cell phone, throws it on the passenger seat.

      He SWERVES through two lanes and barely makes it to the exit 
      ramp, causing three cars behind him to fishtail and CRASH 
      into each other.

      The SUV speeds down the ramp and blazes through the red 
      light, shooting onto a surface street.

                                  KRAMER (PRE-LAP)
                    They switched off their 
                      transponder!


      The Boeing barrels down the runway.


      Simon s SUV skids off the road, CRASHES through a chain-link 
      fence, and ends up on a service road parallel to the runway.                                                                                    16.

      We catch a SHORT GLIMPSE OF SEAN behind one of the aircraft 
      windows, watching the SUV.


      Simon cringes as he swerves his SUV onto the runway and into 
      a collision course with the speeding airliner.  

      The plane LIFTS OFF with a DEAFENING ROAR.  The SUV RATTLES 
      and SHAKES as the Boeing flies over it.  The LANDING GEAR 
      misses the car by just a few inches. 

      The SUV screeches to a halt.  Simon looks up at the rising 
      plane, defeated yet glad to still be alive.

      He taps the tiny high-tech COMM-LINK that we didn t know was 
      hidden in his ear. It activates with a beep.  Simon addresses 
      someone -- we don t know who.

                                  SIMON
                          (into comm-link)
                    I failed.  They re airborne.  It s 
                    all in your hands now...  I hope 
                    you know what you re doing.

      He puts the car back into gear, steps on the gas, and PEELS 
      OFF in a cloud of dust as we--

                                                              SHOCK CUT TO BLACK.

      Sean and Leila are having drinks with Greg and Vicky.  Vicky 
      has a bandage on her arm and a few scratches on her face.  
      Empty beer bottles and shot glasses sitting on the table.

                                  LEILA
                    You were in shock, after that fall.

                                  GREG
                    I m not letting her anywhere near 
                    the edge of anything any time soon.

                                  VICKY
                    I just leaned over to take a photo, 
                    next thing I know, wham!  It was 
                    like getting hit by a truck.

                                  GREG
                    Sean, buddy, Vicky s still here 
                    because of you. It was all you, man.

                                  VICKY
                    Yeah, I totally owe you one...

                                  SEAN
                    There were a lot of other people 
                    coming to help you.  I just 
                    happened to be faster.

                                  LEILA
                          (proud of Sean)
                    Captain of the swim team back in 
                    college.  He almost made it to the 
                    Olympics.

                                  GREG
                    No way!  All right, man!  Awesome!

                                  VICKY
                    Okay, you know what?  You guys are 
                    not going to that stupid beach 
                    barbecue.  Some celebrity who lives 
                    on the island is having a big party 
                    tonight.  We re not sure who yet, 
                    but we re totally crashing it.  And 
                    you guys are coming with us!                                                                                    23.

      You know, Vicky, you should I don t know...  It s not 
      really take it easy...really our thing.

      Off a grinning Vicky, downing another shot...

      JET-SETTERs and BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE all around.  Giant beds 
      flank each side of the pool, tiki-torches and fire pits.

      Camera snakes through the crowd and finds Sean, Leila, Greg 
      and Vicky entering the party.

                                  VICKY
                    I told you we would get in.  These 
                    babies never let me down.  

      She looks down at her revealing blouse and grins.

      leads the way DEEPER INTO THE CROWD...

      AT THE BAR - A FEW DRINKS LATER

      The BARTENDER pours another round while Greg explains the 
      cast on his arm to Sean.

                                  GREG
                    First day in Miami, we were roller-
                    blading, I took a dive, Bam!, broken.

                                  SEAN
                    I m sorry.  That sucks.

                                  GREG
                    Yeah.  So your girlfriend, she s 
                    cool.  You re a lucky guy.  How 
                    long you guys been together?                                                                                    24.

                    Seven years. With a couple of years 
                    off in the middle. We met at MIT.

                    Oh, excuse me, MIT.  So you re like 
                    Aquaman and Brainiac all in one.

                                  SEAN
                    Where s Vicky?

                                  LEILA
                    Chasing a tray of mini-quiches, I 
                    think.

                                  GREG
                    Oh!  She loves mini-quiches.
                          (then)
                    Hey, you know, we were talking 
                    earlier.  The four of us should 
                    totally hang for the rest of the 
                    cruise.  Like, if you want to do 
                    some of the excursions and 
                      activities together.  It ll be more 
                    fun, right?  What do you think?

      Leila s cell I-Phone starts RINGING.

                                  LEILA
                          (less than thrilled)
                    Uh, yeah, sure.
                          (checks caller ID, then)
                    Guys, I ll be right back.

      She steps into a QUIET CORNER behind a cabana and answers.

                                  LEILA (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?                                                                                    25.


      Sean holds Leila in his arms as they take in the AMAZING VIEW 
      of the moonlit ocean, lulled by the sound of the waves.                                                                                    28.

                                  LEILA
                    It s amazing how clear the sky is 
                    out here.  Look at all the stars.

                                  SEAN
                          (cute and corny)
                    I got them just for you.  That s 
                    right, I know how to treat my lady.

                                  LEILA
                    Yes, you do.  And you re a dork.

                                  SEAN
                    I know.  But you love it.

      They kiss.  Sean ponders his next move, hesitates... then...

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    Okay, you know what?  Let s make a 
                    deal.  After the snorkeling thing 
                    we have tomorrow, let s go out for 
                      a romantic dinner.  No Greg, no 
                    Vicky.  Just the two of us.  I ll 
                    ask the concierge to find us a nice 
                    little restaurant in Grand Cayman.

                                  LEILA
                    I would love that.

      She smiles.  Another kiss.

      BACK INSIDE THE SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

      -- as they get ready for bed.  Leila steps into the bathroom.

                                  LEILA (O.S.)
                    Oh, my dad called.  He says hi.

                                  SEAN
                    Hi, dad!

      Keeping his eyes on the bathroom door, Sean surreptitiously 
      pulls a SMALL VELVET BOX out of his pocket.  He slides open 
      the closet door and quickly dials a code on the small ROOM 
      SAFE S CODE PAD.  He opens the velvet box and takes a quick 
      peek inside.  A BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND RING.

      Today didn t work out, but tomorrow will be the big day.  He 
      smiles, puts the box inside the safe and CLOSES IT as we--

                                                  END FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT TO:


      Quick ESTABLISHING MONTAGE.  Shiny glass high-rises cutting 
      through the postcard-perfect blue sky.  JET SKIERS zipping 
      through the azure water near the McArthur causeway.  The 
      Miami sun shines bright, giving everything a WARM GLOW.


      The marina.  Rows of expensive yachts.  QUICK SHOTS of water-
      front mansions with lush landscaping.

      PRE-LAP the DRONING SOUND OF PARTY GUESTS talking... Kids 
      laughing... before WE SETTLE ON...


      A beautiful two-storey MANSION nestled on 6 acres of land at 
      the end of a small peninsula in an exclusive gated community.

                                            SUPER:
                                President s Vacation Retreat
                                    Coral Gables, Florida

      We MOVE PAST THE HOUSE to REVEAL...  A large, perfectly 
      groomed backyard jutting into Biscayne Bay, decorated for the 
      first twins  birthday party.  Balloons, garlands, food 
      stations, tables and chairs, a couple of CLOWNS, PARENTS 
      milling about, KIDS running around.

      Half a dozen SECRET SERVICE AGENTS patrol the grounds, trying 
      to stay inconspicuous as they keep an eye on the celebration.  

                                  CHRISTINA (O.S.)
                    On your dad s mark...

      We MOVE to REVEAL the FIRST FAMILY at the cake table, 
      surrounded by a CROWD OF GUESTS.

      President ELIAS MARTINEZ, late 40 s, Benjamin Bratt meets 
      JFK.  Smart, confident, accessible, a family man and loving 
      father.

      His wife CHRISTINA, early 40 s, beautiful, understanding and 
      supportive, her spirited temper occasionally goes unchecked.  
      Her children SANDRA and DAVID (aka the twins) are her number 
      one priority.                                                                                    31.

      The twins are turning 8.  They stand in front of their 
      respective cakes.  David starts blowing his candles before--

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Go!

                                  SANDRA
                          (offended, blowing her 
                            candles)
                    You were supposed to wait!

      Everyone cracks up and claps.  Ad-lib happy birthdays.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Happy birthday, guys!  I love you 
                    both so much.

                                  DAVID
                    Now can we open presents?

      VICE PRESIDENT MASON JARVIS (60 s, dignified, steely but 
      tactful) approaches.  The President walks over to meet him.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Mason!

                                  JARVIS
                    Mr. President.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    I m glad you could make it.  Just 
                    in time for cake.

                                  JARVIS
                    Thanks but I ll need to pass.

      ON CHRISTINA

      -- cutting the cake.  She looks up just in time to see Jarvis  
      mumble something to her husband.  Martinez s smile quickly 
      fades as he turns towards the house.  She follows his gaze.

      Standing by the house are General Mullendore and CIA DIRECTOR  
      BLAKE STERLING (early 50 s, fervid and brash), staring 
      sternly at him.

      Martinez realizes Christina has been watching them.  He 
      mouths  Sorry.   She nods and smiles understandingly, mouths 
       it s okay.   She s learned to hide her disappointment...


      We MOVE past a couple of news vans and over to the press area 
      on the opposite side of the property.  A lectern adorned with 
      the White House logo sits on a small terrace.  REPORTERS and 
      their CREWS are setting up for the upcoming press conference.                                                                                    32.

      Accompanied by a CAMERAMAN and a SOUND ENGINEER, MSNBC 
      REPORTER PAULA DIXON (late 20 s, petite and unassuming, 
      driven, can charm or bulldoze her way into anything) walks up 
      to the TWO AGENTS guarding the entrance.

                                  PAULA
                    Paula Dixon.  This is my crew.

      The agents start checking their clearance.


      SIMON opens the back door of a limo.  We QUICKLY MOVE PAST 
      HIM to REVEAL President Martinez and Christina in evening 
      attires, making their way back to the limo as the secret 
      service part the sea of cheering ONLOOKERS.                                                                                    35.

                                            SUPER:

                                  Thirteen months earlier

      They wave and smile as camera flashes illuminate the night.  
      We again catch a GLIMPSE OF SIMON holding the car door as the 
      first couple steps into the limo. 


      TIGHT ON A RED FOLDER

      -- marked  TOP SECRET: INOSTRANKA , as it lands heavily on a 
      coffee table.

      WIDE to REVEAL President Martinez, visibly angry, pacing 
      behind the Resolute desk.  Sterling stands in the middle of 
      the room.                                                                                    36.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Did it just slip your mind?  For 
                    god s sake, Blake, when were you 
                    planning to tell me about this?

      Sterling stares, doesn t answer, but his silence says it all.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ (CONT D)
                          (fuming)
                    You were just gonna keep running 
                    this without my knowledge?

                                  STERLING
                    Plausible deniability, sir.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    That s your excuse?!

                                  STERLING
                      Information regarding the Mount 
                      Inostranka Facility has always been 
                    on a need-to-know basis.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    I m the President of the United 
                    States.  I need to know.

                                  STERLING
                      I determined The Facility to be an 
                      unnecessary distraction that would 
                    pull you away from more pressing 
                    issues.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Oh, just... Blake, just cut the 
                    crap, all right?
                          (beat)
                    Did the previous administration 
                    know about this?

                                  STERLING
                    Only the Vice President.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Of course.  It figures.
                          (then)
                    So it s true?  It s all true?

      Sterling nods silently.  A slew of emotions hits Martinez.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ (CONT D)
                    This is... unbelievable.
                          (grabs the file)
                    How many of them are there?  How 
                    many prisoners?                                                                                    37.

                                  STERLING
                      Detainees.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                          (reading the file)
                    Whatever.   Detainees.   Who get 
                    tortured.  How many?

                                  STERLING
                      Ninety-seven.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                          (reading off the file)
                    And eighteen fugitives...

                                  STERLING
                    ... Seventeen.

      Martinez stares, waiting for an explanation that Sterling 
      would rather not give.  But he clearly has no choice...

                                  STERLING (CONT D)
                    We recaptured one of them last week, 
                    but she tried to escape again, 
                    assaulted one of our agents...  The 
                    agent acted in self-defense...

      We assume he is referring to Kathryn and something that led 
      to her demise after her return to the base.  Martinez shakes 
      his head... and lets out a TENSE SIGH, puts on his glasses 
      and starts flipping through the pages of the thick file.  

                                  STERLING (CONT D)
                    May I ask how you obtained this file?

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    No, you may not.
                          (then, stern, bewildered)
                    This is... I mean, I don t even 
                    know how to feel.

                                  STERLING
                    The CIA has overseen this program 
                    for many years and I can assure you 
                    that everything is under control.  
                    There s no need for you to--

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    I want to go there.  I want to meet 
                    them.  And this guy...

      Martinez pulls a PHOTOGRAPH OF NEIL out of the folder.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ (CONT D)
                    Neil McMann.  He s their leader?                                                                                    38.

                                  STERLING
                    Leader, spokesperson, something 
                    like that.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    I want to meet him.

      Off Sterling as he reluctantly acquiesces...

      PRE-LAP sound of slow motion helicopter blades...


      The sound of the blades catches up to full speed as a 
      WHITEHAWK HELICOPTER flies into frame.  A breathtaking view 
      of the snow-covered Alaskan Brooks Range.

                                            SUPER:
                                  Brooks Mountain Range
                                            Alaska


      The helicopter reaches the mountain range... and hidden 
      behind it...  an expansive valley.  And nestled at the bottom 
      of the Inostranka mountain is a high-tech research and 
      military facility nicknamed THE FACILITY.  

      Pods of buildings connected by long corridors.  And next to 
      the complex, barely visible under the snow, a gigantic, 
      triangular structure. 

      The base is buzzing with activity -- snow mobiles, ATVs, snow 
      plows, and a few BUNDLED-UP PEOPLE.  Glints of sunlight 
      reflect against the glass buildings.


      The small group bursts out of the house onto a paved path.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Where?  Here?                                                                                    42.

                                  AGENT #1
                    The whole Eastern seaboard, sir.  
                    We think an attack is already under 
                    way and you may be the target.

      Martinez LOOKS UP and SEES...

      CHRISTINA AND THE TWINS

      ... waiting for him aboard MARINE ONE on the water-front 
      helipad at the end of the paved pathway.  Christina, holding 
      the twins, waves with a calm smile.  He waves back.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Where are we evacuat--

      The ground starts SHAKING.  Something in the sky over the 
      water catches the President s attention.  And sends chills 
      down his spine.  The others LOOK UP and FREEZE as the 
      DEAFENING ROAR of the approaching jet drowns out everything.  

      Martinez looks at his family aboard Marine One, realizing the 
      chopper lies directly in the jetliner s trajectory.  He 
      notices the sudden confusion on his wife s face as she picks 
      up on the vibrations... and she turns back towards him with a 
      puzzled look, still unaware of her impending doom.

      One of the agents takes off, runs back towards the house.  
      The others try to pull the President back.  But he resists, 
      locking eyes with Christina.

                                  AGENT #1
                    Sir!

      ON CHRISTINA

      -- staring at him, confused by the commotion and by her 
      husband s last words...  She TURNS AROUND and looks out 
      through the helicopter window.  AND WE FINALLY SEE...

      THE AIRLINER DIVING FULL SPEED TOWARDS THEM, seconds from 
      impact.  Seconds from turning the entire neighborhood into a 
      giant ball of fire.

      Christina turns back to look at her husband, terrified and 
      fully aware that there s nowhere to run. 

                                                              SHOCK CUT TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    43.

                                        ACT FIVE

      SUPER OVER BLACK...

                                      MARK GASIOROWSKI

                                                                  WHITE FLASH TO:


      Samantha walks out of the house through the open garage door.  
      The night is dark and quiet.  Which doesn t seem to bother 
      her in the least.  She walks over to her bike, picks it up 
      and puts it away in the garage.

      A SHUFFLING NOISE, somewhere near.  Samantha hears it, 
      FREEZES.  She stares into the night past the open garage 
      door.  She waits and listens... when suddenly--

      A GLOVED HAND

      -- appears from behind her, MUFFLES HER SCREAMS.


      Vicky hauls herself up onto the boat.  Sean gives her a hand 
      and finds himself a little too close to her body.  Although 
      she doesn t seem to mind.

                                  VICKY
                    In spite of my bitter half s 
                    protests.

                                  SEAN
                    Well, I doubt his cast is 
                      waterproof, so he had a point.  
                    What did he end up doing?

                                  VICKY
                    Some jungle excursion.  I don t 
                    know.  Sounded lame.

      Sean is reviewing the PHOTOS on his digital camera.

                                  SEAN
                    Leila s gonna be so bummed.  She 
                    would have loved this.

                                  VICKY
                    Yeah, she picked the wrong day to 
                    get sick.

                                  VICKY (CONT D)
                    Well, at least we had fun, right?

      She smiles a naughty smile, making Sean feel awkward...


      Tourists walking back to the parking lot and the beach.  The 
      crew is still unloading the boat in the b.g.  Sean and Vicky 
      walk back to the shuttle bus.  Sean is on his cell. 

                                  VICKY
                    It s probably just food poisoning 
                    and she ll be fine tomorrow.  
                    Unless it s that new swine flu.                                                                                    53.

                                  SEAN
                    No, she was vaccinated.  I think 
                    maybe she drank a little too much 
                    last night.
                          (then)
                    She s not picking up.

                                  VICKY
                    She s probably sleeping.

                                  SEAN
                          (listening)
                    Voice mail...
                          (then, into phone)
                    Hey, Leila, baby, it s me.  Hope 
                    you re feeling better.  If you need 
                    anything, just give me a call, 
                    okay?  We re heading back now. I ll 
                    see you in a little bit.  Love you.

      He hangs up just as they reach the bus.
