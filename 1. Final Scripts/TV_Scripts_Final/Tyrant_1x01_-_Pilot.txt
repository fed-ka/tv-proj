      FIVE GUNSHOTS: BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! SMASH CUT TO --


      INT. AL-FAHED RESIDENCE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

      BARRY: CLOSE: he s 40, beaded with sweat, wide awake in his 
      bed, lying motionless on his back, staring up at the ceiling. 

      His wife, MOLLY, sleeps peacefully by his side with one arm 
      laying across him affectionately. Barry, finally having had 
      enough of being awake, sighs, gently sets her arm aside, and 
      reaches over to the end table and grabs his GLASSES -- as he 
      does so, we notice a SCAR on his hand. He sits up on the side 
      of the bed, puts the glasses on and checks the time - 4:32 -- 
      and reaches for A WEDDING INVITATION on the bedside table. 

      ON THE WEDDING INVITATION

      It s decorated in gold and green. Tacky but expensive. Those 
      of us who can t read the elaborate ARABIC cursive on one side 
      of the invitation can read the ENGLISH on the mirror side: 
       The Honorable General Jamal Al-Fahed requests your presence 
      at the wedding of his son, Major Ahmed...   

      ON BARRY

      As he sighs at the infernal invitation and gets out of bed. 


      INT. AL-FAHED RESIDENCE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Barry, now dressed for a jog, quietly closes the bedroom door 
      behind him. He holds running shoes in his hands. 

      He walks past a door with a POSTER OF NICKI MINAJ on it, and 
      a homemade stenciled-spray-painted sign that reads: A WOMAN 
      WITHOUT A MAN IS LIKE A FISH WITHOUT A BICYCLE. He smiles.

      He cracks the door slightly and peeks in and sees: 


      INT. EMMA S ROOM - NIGHT

      Books everywhere. A poster of LADY GAGA and under it, on the 
      bed, EMMA, 17, zaftig but cute, wrapped in a blanket, asleep. 
      A copy of  VAGINA  by Naomi Wolf on her pillow, her hipster 
      glasses half off her face. Barry walks over, gently takes off 
      her glasses, sets the book aside, covers her; takes a moment 
      to look at her with appreciation for her willful spirit --                                                                     11-27-12     2.


      INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Barry quietly shuts the door: and walks over to a door on the 
      other side. He opens the door and looks in and sees --


      INT. SAMMY S ROOM - NIGHT

      A total jock s room. Posters of athletes, and evidence of an 
      athletic life strewn everywhere. A single sized bed against 
      the wall. On it, SAMMY, 15, handsome, well-built, with his 
      father s olive skin, sleeps naked under the sheets. Barry 
      walks to the bed and squats down close to Sammy s face.

                                  BARRY
                    Sammy. Wanna go for a run?

      Sammy opens his eyes: like his Mom s: blue. A heartbreaker.

                                  SAMMY
                    ...huh?

                                  BARRY
                    I m going out for a run. Wondered 
                    if maybe you wanted to come with.

                                  SAMMY
                    ...what TIME is it?

                                  BARRY
                    A little after five.

                                  SAMMY
                    Are you crazy?

      Sammy turns onto his other side. OFF BARRY: AH WELL.


      INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Barry sits on a chair and finishes lacing up his sneakers. He 
      gets up to leave and as he does he magnets the INVITATION to 
      the fridge. He stares at it balefully, as if it s trapping 
      him, crushing him, and WE PUSH IN ON BARRY -- SMASH CUT TO --


      EXT. ASIMA STREET - DAY [FLASHBACK, 1979]

      A brown Mercedes Benz parked at the entrance to a three story 
      building. Two military jeeps park on either side of it. It s 
      a convoy. SIX ARMED GUARDS stand by the vehicles.                                                                      11-27-12     3.


      Across the street TWO MEN are busy painting a 50 foot 
      portrait of President Hassan Al-Fahed on the entire side of a 
      building. They ve completed his strong featured face, his 
      wise narrow eyes, his mustache -- his hair is JET BLACK. 

      SUPER: ASIMA, 1979.


      INT. EYE DOCTOR CLINIC, ASIMA - DAY [FLASHBACK]

      BASSAM (11) is slightly chubby, nerdy, squints out the 3rd 
      floor window. SUPER: ASIMA, 1979. Then, we see what he sees --

      HIS POV

      Across the street TWO MEN are are busy painting a 50 foot 
      portrait of President Hassan Al-Fahed on the entire side of a 
      building. Bassam s slightly blurred vision resolves the 
      image: the men have completed the leader s strong-featured 
      face, wide narrow eyes, mustache - and JET BLACK hair. 

      ON BASSAM as he looks up at his father, HASSAN AL-FAHED, 40, 
      who is also looking out the window, studying his portrait. 
      He s handsome enough, but that portrait across the street is 
      clearly a glamour shot. He turns to the mirror and looks -- 
      his hair is GREY. 

                                  DOCTOR (O.S.)
                    Second row from the bottom. 

      Hassan turns to see what s going on which brings us into -- A 
      WIDE ANGLE revealing we are in an optometrist's office. The 
      doctor covers the eye of Bassam s older brother, JAMAL (13), 
      who wears a military uniform; in contrast to Bassam, he is 
      athletic, confident.   

                                  JAMAL
                    Nine, three, two, five, six.

                                  DOCTOR
                    Great. Now the bottom...? 

                                  JAMAL
                    Three, one, nine, eight, seven.

                                  HASSAN
                    Perfect. 

                                  DOCTOR
                          (after a smile at Jamal)
                    And now Bassam...                                                                    11-27-12     4.


      As Jamal takes a lollipop from a jar, Bassam ambles toward 
      the doctor. Sits before the chart. The doctor covers Bassam s 
      left eye. 

                                  DOCTOR (CONT D)
                    Top row. 

      Bassam s POV: every single number is blurry. EVERYTHING. 

      ON BASSAM: squinting. Really, he s just guessing. 

                                  BASSAM
                    Three?

      Hassan stares at the chart with scorn. It s the wrong number. 

                                  HASSAN
                    Five.

                                  BASSAM
                    Sorry.

      Hassan sighs in disappointment. Bassam starts to tear up. 

                                  DOCTOR
                    That s fine. Take your time. 

                                  HASSAN
                    Sit up straight. 

      Bassam straightens up. He wipes a tear from his eye. He 
      stares at the chart. The doctor points at a number. 

                                  BASSAM
                    Eight...? 

      Hassan sighs again. OFF BASSAM: SCARED AND ASHAMED. 


      INT. EYE DOCTOR CLINIC, WAITING ROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]

      The door opens. Hassan leads the way, followed by Jamal, 
      sucking a lollipop. Bassam is next, wearing thick glasses, 
      eyes red from crying, and the Doctor follows them out.

                                  DOCTOR
                    Bassam! You forgot yours! 

      The doctor plucks a red lollipop from a bowl. Bassam smiles, 
      runs back and retrieves it, hurries back to Hassan s side.  

                                  HASSAN
                    You think you deserve a reward?                                                                     11-27-12     5.


      Bassam looks up at his father -- and then slowly shakes his 
      head. He hands the lollipop to Jamal who takes it willingly, 
      and gives Bassam a cruel teasing smile. OFF BASSAM: SAD/MAD. 


      EXT. ASIMA STREET - DAY [FLASHBACK]

      Hassan, the boys and the bodyguards exit toward the brown 
      Mercedes Benz parked out front, a pair of military jeeps 
      parked on either side of it. A column of ARMED SOLDIERS stand 
      by the vehicles, keeping the gathering crowd at a distance. 

      Hassan waves and smiles at the curious crowd gathered. Jamal 
      imitates his father and waves as well. The crowd cheers. 
      Bassam seems a little ill at ease with the attention. He 
      tries the tiniest wave, not even lifting his arm above his 
      waist; walks on. 

      A 35-year-old SHIITE with a beard and no mustache jumps out 
      of the crowd, runs towards Hassan -- the guards yell --

                                  GUARDS
                    STOP! STOP HIM! 

      -- but he raises his hand which we now see, is attached to a 
      WIRE. The bodyguards scramble for their weapons --


                GUARDS (CONT D)*SHIITE
      STOP HIM!*Death to the tyrant! 

      He presses the button -- EXPLOSION. Blinding light. Falling 
      clouds of debris -- blood in the air -- dust. Then SILENCE. 
      Then: CRIES OF AGONY: and we gradually FADE IN ON --

      SHATTERED GLASS AND DEBRIS everywhere. Body parts. Mayhem. 
      All of it slightly slow, as if happening in a dream...  

      Bassam lies on the ground. HIS NEW GLASSES: a few feet away.  
      He drags himself towards them. The ringing in his ear muffles 
      the screams. AN OFFICIAL CAR in his POV FLAMES AND EXPLODES. 

      With pained effort, he reaches for the glasses; puts them on; 
      and the scene now resolves into full volume and speed. 

      Bassam s POV: the wounded lay on the ground, CRYING for help. 
      People shouting and running. Fire. He turns and looks at - 

      BASSAM S POV

      Hassan is wrapped around Jamal, shielding him from attack. He 
      then looks down at his hand, it s covered in blood; there s a 
      deep, painful cut -- MUSCLE visible through the torn skin. 
      OFF BASSAM: LOOKING DOWN AT HIS INJURED HAND. SMASH TO --                                                                    11-27-12     6.


      INT. ORLANDO OPTOMETRY- DAY

      A SCARRED HAND reaches into a lollipop jar and grabs a 
      lollipop. REVEAL THAT IT S BARRY S HAND as he hands it to a 
      YOUNG KID in his clinic. The kid s MOM stands behind him.

                                  MOM
                    Thank Dr. Barry for the candy. 

                                  KID
                    Thank you, Dr. Barry. 

                                  BARRY
                    My pleasure. 

      The MOM nervously clutches her handbag with both hands. 

                                  MOM
                    Dr. Barry... I feel awful asking... 
                    but if just this one time... 

                                  BARRY
                    It s fine. 

      MOLLY, AT THE DESK, clocks this with FOND IMPATIENCE.

                                  MOM
                    With the divorce and all -- 

                                  BARRY
                    It s fine, I understand... 

      Barry leads her toward the front door as Molly rises.

                                  BARRY (CONT D)
                    ...just take good care of Chris, 
                    Mrs. Russell, and we re even. 

                                  MOLLY
                    Or pay half now and half later?

      The Mom looks to Barry for help: gets just a polite smile. He 
      feels her pain but he s not going to argue with Molly.

                                  MOM
                          (defeated a bit)
                    Yeah. That s probably better. 

      She walks back to the counter and takes out her checkbook.

                                  MOM (CONT D)
                          (to Molly)
                    Sorry for asking.                                                                    11-27-12     7.


      Barry looks over the Mom s shoulder at Molly as the Mom  
      writes the check. Molly s look:  This is right.  OFF BARRY.


      EXT. ORLANDO OPTOMETRY - CONTINUOUS

      Barry waves from the door, smiles to the Mom and Kid as they 
      leave. We see now that this office is in a strip mall between 
      a Kinko s and a Subway.  


      INT. ORLANDO OPTOMETRY - CONTINUOUS

      Barry walks back in and goes to the reception window, where 
      Molly is tidying things up as if she s about to leave.

                                  BARRY
                    Why did you do that?

                                  MOLLY
                    Barry. You re a good man -- 

                                  BARRY
                    -- she doesn t have the money --

                                  MOLLY
                    -- neither do we. 

      She stands up, grabs ONE FILE, and heads toward the back. 

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    If you weren t such a soft touch -- 
                    which is part of why I love you, 
                    you know that -- we d be paying for 
                    this expansion in cash instead of 
                    begging the bank for a construction 
                    loan.   

      Barry watches with appreciation as Molly grabs her jacket --

                                  MOLLY (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    There s room in the world for you, 
                    too, Barry. Not just everyone else.

       -- and steps out into the waiting room and passes him.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    Ready to go...?

      OFF BARRY: as he follows her out. He loves her.                                                                    11-27-12     8.


      EXT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK - DAY

      Establishing.


      INT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK CUBICLE - DAY

      Barry and Molly sit expectantly opposite a BANKER, who has 
      the loan application documents laid out before him. A FAKE 
      PALM TREE looms over the little room from the back corner.

                                  BANKER
                    So your loan application looks like 
                    it s all in order, thanks for that. 

                                  BARRY
                          (re: Molly)
                    She s a pro.

      The BANKER closes the file and gets CIRCUMSPECT.

                                  BANKER
                    But in all likelihood, we re 
                    probably not going to be able to 
                    help you. Just being honest, based 
                    on what I m seeing here. 

                                  BARRY
                    It s a realistic business plan.

                                  BANKER
                    I m sure it is, but...
                          (after a beat)
                    There s no way you could have 
                    SOMEONE co-sign, someone with some 
                    assets -- friends, or family --

                                  BARRY
                    No.

      Molly gives Barry a quick look.

                                  BANKER
                    Because that would help...

                                  BARRY
                    There s no one like that in our 
                    lives. Sorry. There s just not.

                                  BANKER
                    Then I m afraid submitting this to 
                    the credit committee is a waste of 
                    time.                                                                    11-27-12     9.


      BEAT. Barry accepts this, grimaces fatefully, rises --

                                  BARRY
                    Alright then. Thanks for your help.

      -- but Molly stops him. 

                                  MOLLY
                    Wait.

      Molly turns back to the Banker.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    We re booked up solid every day. We 
                    can meet those numbers, we can.

                                  BANKER
                    I m sure you can, Mrs. Al-Fahed. 
                    But I m not the one who decides. 
                    And the economy, as you know, is 
                    not what it was. I m sorry.

                                  MOLLY
                    Just submit the application. If you 
                    would. We ll take our chances with 
                    the committee. 

      The Banker adopts an official smile, a patient tone --

                                  BANKER
                    Okay. We ll be in touch.

                                  MOLLY
                    Thank you.

      Molly exits past Barry. The Banker gives Barry a smile that s 
      PITYING and heads off the other way. OFF BARRY: UNMANNED. 


      EXT. AL-FAHED HOUSE - NIGHT

      Establishing.

                                  EMMA (O.S.)
                    Listen to this... 


      INT. AL-FAHED RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Sammy is eating cold pizza from a take-out box as Emma reads 
      from an iPad, horrified.                                                                    11-27-12     10.


                                  EMMA
                    ...they blew up grandpa s limo last 
                    year. Twice!

                                  SAMMY
                    Yeah, they blew up the limo but 
                    they didn t blow up Grandpa. The 
                    backseat of that thing is, like, 
                      armor-clad. We ll be fine. 
                          (after a bite)
                    We re like royalty there, Emma. 
                    You re like a fat Kate Middleton.

                                  EMMA
                    Which makes you what... a gay 
                    Prince Harry? 

                                  SAMMY
                    How do you know he isn t gay? He 
                    seems totally closeted to me.

                                  EMMA
                    You do realize they hang gays, 
                    right? And not hang out WITH. HANG.

      They hear the front door open. Sammy lowers his voice.

                                  SAMMY
                    If you can keep your mouth shut for 
                    once, I should be fine.

      Sammy gets up, washes his hands, as Molly enters, frowning.  

                                  MOLLY
                    I asked you to wait for your father 
                    and me. We brought in Chinese.

                                  SAMMY
                    I have homework. 

                                  EMMA
                    Do I really have to go? 

                                  SAMMY 
                    She s been doing this all night. 
                    Tell her for once in her life, she 
                    won t be the fattest girl at the 
                    wedding. 

                                  MOLLY
                    Sammy, don t talk like that.                                                                  11-27-12     11.


                                  SAMMY
                    I m just saying, this is your 
                    moment, Em! Seize that shit! 

      Sammy exits, passing Barry as he enters, bearing Chinese. 

                                  BARRY
                    I thought we were having a family 
                    dinner. Where are you going?

                                  SAMMY
                    Homework.

                                  EMMA
                          (to Molly)
                    Don t take my word for it, read 
                    what Dad s friend s been writing. 

      She slides the iPad toward Molly as Barry sets the bags down.

                                  EMMA (CONT D)
                    I can t believe we re CHOOSING to 
                    go to number THREE on Amnesty 
                      International s list of top human 
                    rights offenders --

      Emma heads for the hallway.

                                  EMMA (CONT D)
                    I m not going.

                                  MOLLY
                    You re going.

                                  EMMA
                    -- AND THIS HOUSE IS NUMBER FOUR!

      Emma exits, stranding her parents. 

                                  MOLLY
                    I guess it s just us.

      Ever the pragmatist, Molly sets the table for two. Barry  
      looks at the iPad -- a photo of violence in the street under 
      the headline:  WEDDING IGNITES VIOLENT PROTESTS.  

                                  BARRY
                    Fauzi s really going after my 
                    family for this wedding.

                                  MOLLY
                    Did he call you back?                                                                  11-27-12     12.


                                  BARRY
                    Not yet. I left a message. Maybe he 
                    doesn t want to hear from me.

                                  MOLLY
                    He s your friend. Try again. 

      Barry purses his lower lip a bit: OK. He ll do it. 


      INT. AL-FAHED HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Molly stands in front of a mirror, trying out a BLACK EVENING 
      DRESS as Barry half-enters from the master bath in BOXERS.

                                  MOLLY
                    What do you think? This is the only 
                    thing I have in my closet that 
                    looks even remotely good on me. 

      Barry stands in the bathroom doorway and looks at her.

                                  BARRY
                    It s sleeveless. 

                                  MOLLY
                    I know, it s scandalous -- but what 
                    if I accessorize it thusly? 

      She grabs a scarf and ties it around her head, over her face. 

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    ...this help?

                                  BARRY
                    Yeah. Now it s perfect.

      She tosses the scarf aside.

                                  MOLLY
                    I want to look good for your family. 

                                  BARRY
                    YOU RE my family. You and the kids. 
                          (after a beat)
                    Maybe Emma s right. Maybe we 
                    shouldn t go. 

      She pulls off the dress; now she s in a bra and panties. 

                                  MOLLY
                    Barry...                                                                  11-27-12     13.


                                  BARRY
                    We ve been trying to expand the 
                    store for years, and the credit 
                    committee may want to talk to us. 
                    How would it look if they know 
                    we re spending money we don t have?

                                  MOLLY
                    If you wanted to save money, you 
                    could have saved us what we blew on 
                    those plane tickets. 

                                  BARRY
                    I don t want his private jet --

                                  MOLLY
                    Sammy would have enjoyed it. 

                                  BARRY
                    All the more reason. 

                                  MOLLY
                    Honey. In all the years we ve been 
                    together, your father has never 
                    asked you to visit. Not once. 

                                  BARRY
                    Because he knows what the answer 
                    will be. And it s the right answer.

                                  MOLLY
                    Neither of you are getting any 
                    younger. This could be the last 
                    time you see him. Have you thought 
                    about that?

      She sits on the bed and pats the spot next to her. He smiles 
      a little, required to join her; so he sits beside her. BEAT. 

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    It s not just your Dad who s 
                    asking; it s your whole family. I 
                    know you LOVE to live like you 
                    hatched from some sort of space 
                    egg, totally on your own, but these 
                    people are your family. That 
                    matters. We re going.

      Barry gives Molly a look. He s about to say they re not. But 
      her look back tells him, with love: that s not an option.

                                  BARRY
                          (after a beat, quieter)
                    Just promise me we ll come home.                                                                  11-27-12     14.


                                  MOLLY
                    Why wouldn t we come home? Crazy.

                                  BARRY
                    Just promise.

                                  MOLLY
                      I promise.

      She kisses him. It starts as a sweet consolation, but turns 
      into something sexual as his hand goes to her breast -- and 
      then between her legs. And then she pulls away --

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    Get us some wine and let me get 
                    ready for bed and then -- we ll 
                    finish that.

      She kisses him quickly, rises, and heads for the bathroom. 
      OFF BARRY: smiling a bit at this pre-sex tradition of theirs.


      INT. AL-FAHED RESIDENCE, KITCHEN

      Barry pours WINE into a pair of GLASSES, picks up his CELL. 


      INT. MA'AN, FAUZI S APARTMENT - DAY

      CLOSE ON FAUZI NADAL, 40, wearing a galabiya (Muslim garb), 
      staring out a window with AMJAD NADAL, 17, his handsome son.  

                                  FAUZI  
                    They re bringing elephants.

                                  AMJAD
                    Hmm...?

                                  FAUZI
                    From India. For Ahmed s wedding. 
                    Fucking elephants...

      Fauzi s POV: A war torn city. TEENAGERS in ski masks drag two 
      tires to the middle of the main road and set them on fire. 

                                  FAUZI (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    ...while the people go hungry.

      BACK ON THIS ACTIVIST FATHER AND SON

                                  AMJAD
                    You should write about that, father.                                                                  11-27-12     15.


                                  FAUZI
                    I m going to.

      Fauzi, in no hurry, grabs a camera and takes some snapshots. 

                                  FAUZI (CONT D)
                    I m going to write about all of it.

      A cellphone VIBRATES on a table in a plain apartment. The TV 
      sits on old phone books. Amjad goes to it.  

                                  AMJAD
                    It s him again. Bassam.

      Father and son exchange a look. It looks as if Amjad wishes 
      his father would accept this overture -- but Fauzi won t.

                                  FAUZI
                    No.

      Fauzi turns and looks out the window at the streets of Ma'an. 

      OFF FAUZI: as the phone keeps ringing and he looks mournfully 
      out at his struggling country. It finally stops and BEEPS.


      INT. AL-FAHED RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Barry, having gotten no answer, leaves a message --

                                  BARRY
                    Fauzi, it s me again. I hope you 
                    got my messages. I just wanted you 
                    to know... we re coming tomorrow. 
                    So call me when you get this. 

      -- and hangs up and stares at THE INVITATION ON THE FRIDGE. 
      OFF BARRY: LOOKING AT IT. HE TAKES A DRINK. SIGHS. FUCK.


      EXT. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

      Barry, Molly, Sammy and Emma rush with their LUGGAGE. 

                                  SAMMY
                    I told you not to take the 436, 
                    Dad! You re SO special needs!

                                  MOLLY
                    Don t talk to your father that way, 
                    Sammy. The construction on the 528 
                    would have been just as bad --                                                                  11-27-12     16.


                                  SAMMY
                    Can we just run?

      Sammy leads the family s mad dash into the terminal. 


      INT. ORLANDO AIRPORT, SECURITY - DAY

      ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE SECURITY LINES

      Molly s next to Sammy and Emma, waiting impatiently for -- 

      BARRY

      With his hands in the air, getting frisked vigorously by a 
      big CUSTOMS OFFICER who eyes him suspiciously. 

      Finally, Barry s let through! He grabs his suitcase, joins 
      his family with a SMILE that says  We all know I have to go 
      through this when we fly  -- and they all HAUL ASS -- 


      INT. ORLANDO AIRPORT, GATE - DAY

      The Al-Faheds reach the gate, breathless. The gate is EMPTY.

                                  SAMMY
                    We missed it! Fuck! 
                          (to Barry)
                    I told you to drive faster.  

                                  MOLLY
                    Sammy, that s enough!
                          (to Barry)
                    I m sure there s another flight.

                                  EMMA
                    Or maybe it s a sign that we should 
                    just stay home.

                                  MOLLY
                    We re all going --

                                  STEWARDESS (O.S.)
                    Mr. Al-Fahed?

      -- they turn to see a BEAUTIFUL ARAB STEWARDESS standing next 
      to them, wearing a green suit and a head scarf. 

                                  BARRY
                    Uhh, yeah?                                                                  11-27-12     17.


                                  STEWARDESS
                    My name is Hira. It s an honor to 
                    meet you. Are you ready to board? 

                                  MOLLY
                    The plane s still here? 

                                  SAMMY
                    Yes, thank God, the plane s here!

                                  BARRY
                    I don t understand, where are all 
                    the other passengers? 

                                  HIRA
                    You re the only passengers. Your 
                    family bought the other tickets. 

                                  BARRY
                    All of them...?

      OFF BARRY: already caught too tightly in his father s web.


      INT. PLANE - DAY

      Sammy is the first to enter the empty plane -- LOVING IT!

                                  SAMMY
                    THIS is what I m talking about! 

      He drops his stuff on a wide, leather first class seat. Molly 
      and Emma enter and are equally impressed. But Barry walks 
      past the first class cabin, reading his plane ticket... 

                                  EMMA
                    Dad...?

                                  MOLLY
                    Barry, where are you going?

                                  BARRY
                    18-C...

      He finds his middle seat in the economy class and sits. The 
      family all walks back to find him sitting there.

                                  SAMMY
                    Dad, stop being retarded.

                                  MOLLY
                    Come sit with us.                                                                    11-27-12     18.


                                  BARRY
                    This is the ticket I bought. This 
                    is where I am going to sit.

      Molly gives Barry a look and she and the kids go back up to 
      first class. OFF BARRY: standing his ground in economy. 


      INT. PLAIN APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

      ...LOUD CRY. 

      A GIRL WEARING A FULL BURQA stands in the middle of a large 
      bedroom. She looks up to the ceiling. 

      Four armed scary looking GOONS stand against the walls 
      watching her. They re huge, pumped on steroids.

      At first it looks like some kind of weird religious ritual, 
      but suddenly... She is lifted from the ground and we see that 
      someone is under the burqa with her.  

      Then someone throws her on the bed and pulls up her burqa 
      revealing long bronzed, fit legs. He lifts them and shoves 
      his head further in, eating her out. More CRIES. 

      JAMAL AL-FAHED, 42, comes up for air, his face wet. He climbs 
      up her, pulling her burqa further up revealing her breasts -- 
      squeezes them hard, she YELLS, her face still veiled. Her 
      body is small and looks troublingly young. 

      He pulls his shirt off and pants down; he has a tight body 
      and a strong, handsome face -- an Arab stallion. In an 
      instant he s inside her. He pumps hard. Too hard. The bed 
      CREAKS and the GIRL CRIES.

      An ANALOG CLOCK crashes from the end table to the floor. He 
      glances over her shoulder down at it and - 

                                  JAMAL
                    Fuck! I m late. Fuck! 

      He pumps a few more times, quickly, and comes -- we stay on 
      his face as he does so -- it s a mean look; more like relief 
      than pleasure. He pulls out, pulls his pants up, looking down 
      at her laying there, crying; he smiles a little -- 


      INT. PLAIN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Jamal walks into the shabby room. Throws a few bills toward 
      the THREE YOUNG CHILDREN huddled on dirty mattresses on the 
      floor. They look at him, terrified, as he leaves.                                                                   11-27-12     19.


      The eldest SON picks up a bill, which bears an engraved 
      portrait of HASSAN striking an heroic pose. He looks from the 
      bill toward the bedroom, where he hears his mother crying.


      EXT. SLUMS - DAY

      A CURIOUS CROWD OF TRADITIONALLY DRESSED MEN AND WOMEN watch 
      as Jamal exits the building, looks at the crowd and waves. 
      They don t wave back. They stare with fearful, hateful eyes 
      as he gets into his FERRARI SUV, so obviously out of place in 
      this rotten neighborhood. 

      IN THE BACK OF THE CROWD

      HAMID, 28, the woman s husband, eyes Jamal, his anger visible 
      through his tears. Beside him stands Fauzi holding a SMALL 
      BOX with one hand, his other hand on Hamid s elbow, at once 
      offering comfort and urging restraint as they wait for Jamal 
      and his goons to drive off before rushing into the building.  


      INT. BEDROOM - DAY

      The woman is deep in prayer, kneeling back and forth, in a 
      trance. Hamid enters the room, she is with her back to him. 

                                  HAMID
                    Fatma... 

      Fatma turns. She s very young. And very beautiful. Her face 
      is stained with thick, runny mascara. 

                                  FATMA
                    Hamid...
                          (getting no look)
                    Hamid, look at me, please...?

      Hamid looks away, unable to look at his wife right now.

                                  HAMID
                          (re: Fauzi)
                    This is the man I told you about. 

      Fatma stares at Fauzi, standing behind her husband. 

                                  FATMA
                    Are you here to kill me? 

                                  FAUZI 
                            (compassionate)
                    No. I m not here to kill you.                                                                  11-27-12     20.


      Fauzi kneels down before Fatma and hands her a SMALL PEN BOX 
      he takes from his pocket. ON FATMA S FACE -- What is in that 
      box? OFF FAUZI: INTENT.


      INT. PLANE - DAY

      PUSHING DOWN THE AISLE, we see everyone in first class is 
      asleep; the remnants of huge meals and personal DVD players 
      strewn here and there -- but then we come to economy --

      Barry is wide awake. Nervous. He gets out of his seat and 
      walks to the back and looks out the window. SEES: the low-
      slung buildings crowded together in an orange dusty haze. 
      They ll be landing soon. PUSH IN ON BARRY S FACE AS HE 
      REMEMBERS --


      INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, ROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK 1979]

      Bassam s hand is being bandaged by a NURSE. His mother, HIAM, 
      35, looks at him, worried. She paces back and forth. 

      All around - Mayhem. Officers, soldiers, political figures, 
      guards everywhere. Running up and down the corridor. 

      Hassan barks orders at the officers as they rush this way and 
      that. Livid. Everyone is in panic, afraid of Hassan s rage. 
      He pulls one officer to his side -- this is RAMZI --

                                  HASSAN
                          (quietly)
                    Put together a squad. We re going 
                    to Ma an. They ll pay for this.

      Ramzi nods and heads away. Hassan turns to Hiam. 

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                          (to Hiam)
                    Get Jamal ready. 

                                  BASSAM
                    I want to come too.

                                  JAMAL
                          (teasing incredulousness)
                    ...you? Give me a break. 

      Hiam gives Hassan a look, imploring him to take Bassam.

                                  HASSAN
                          (to Bassam)
                    Fine. Just stay out of the way.                                                                  11-27-12     21.


      Hassan exits. As Bassam watches him go --  

                                  GIRL (O.S.)
                    Did you get new glasses?  

      Bassam turns and sees LEILA, a beautiful 10 year old girl 
      with EMERALD EYES has just come in through the back door. 

                                  HIAM
                    Leila. So beautiful.

                                  LEILA
                          (to Bassam)
                    Show me. 

      Bassam puts on the glasses. One of the handles is broken. It 
      sits crooked on his face. She laughs. Bassam smiles. She 
      looks down at his hand and takes it in hers gently.

                                  LEILA (CONT D)
                    Does it hurt? 


      INT. PLANE - DAY

      Barry s still at the window, touching the hand Leila touched.

                                  HIRA
                    You should take your seat, sir.

                                  BARRY
                    Excuse me...?

                                  HIRA
                    We re starting our descent.

      He takes a deep breath. This isn t going to be easy. 


      EXT. ASIMA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, TARMAC - DAY

        A procession of state and military vehicles. Dignitaries wait 
      in line on a red carpet. Flags all around. The airplane door 
      opens. Sammy is the first one out, a backwards Bruins 
      baseball cap on his head. Emma deplanes after him, holding 
      her bag and a copy of The New Yorker magazine. Molly is next 
      to join her kids at the bottom of the stairs. Finally, Barry 
      appears at the top of the stairs and looks out at his native 
      country, squinting in the sun. He walks down the stairs and 
      joins his family. RAMZI, now 65, Hassan s advisor and closest 
      confidant, walks over and embraces him. 

                                  RAMZI
                    Salam Aleikum.                                                                   11-27-12     22.


                                  BARRY
                          (a tad uncomfortably)
                    Aleikum Ha Salam.

                                  RAMZI
                    It s good to see you, Bassam. How 
                    was your flight?

                                  BARRY
                    It was fine. I specifically asked --

                                  RAMZI
                            (apologetically)
                    I know, but your father disagreed. 
                    You are an Al-Fahed, after all --
                    there are security considerations.

      Right then a SCREECHING SOUND. They all look up and see 
      Jamal s Ferrari speeding towards them. It s followed by the 
      Goons  car. Both cars screech to a halt. 

      Jamal jumps out, followed by his wife, LEILA AL FAHED, 38, 
      STUNNING. Leila s thick black hair framing a strong featured 
      face with deep EMERALD EYES: the girl from the flashback. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Little brother! 

      He rushes over and hugs Barry with almost aggressive force. 

                                  BARRY
                    Jamal... 

      Jamal pulls away and looks at Barry and smiles.

                                  JAMAL
                    You look good. A bit pale, though, 
                    huh? No sun in America? 

      Jamal laughs, turn to - 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    Molly... Beautiful as ever. 

      He grabs her and lifts her off the ground. She laughs. Sammy 
      clocks Jamal s joie de vivre with admiration. Leila and Barry 
      exchange a freighted look. There s history there. 

                                  LEILA
                    Hello, Bassam. 

      Molly reaches out to Leila and initiates an embrace.                                                                  11-27-12     23.


                                  MOLLY
                    Leila, congratulations on the 
                    wedding. You must be so proud.

                                  LEILA
                    We are very proud and happy, yes.

                                  BARRY
                          (to Leila, proud)
                    You remember Sammy and Emma. 

                                  LEILA
                          (big smile)
                    I do! You guys are so big! 

      She shakes their hands. Barry watches her do this, weighing 
      in his mind a past he never lived. Then he turns to Ramzi.

                                  BARRY
                    So -- to the hotel? 

                                  RAMZI
                    Yes. But first, the palace.   

                                  JAMAL
                    My brother just said -- 

                                  RAMZI
                    Your father asked to see him right 
                    away, the moment he arrived. 

                                  JAMAL
                          (forces a smile)
                    Oh. Well. In that case... 

      Jamal BARKS an order in Arabic. The GOONS grab the luggage. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                          (an uneasy laugh)
                    ...we ll go to the palace. Perfect.

      Jamal smiles tightly at Barry with a searching uneasy energy.


      INT. RAMZI S LIMOUSINE - DAY

      Ramzi s LIMO speeds down the empty highway, part of a 
      motorcade. Jamal s along for the ride. Molly and the kids 
      stare at the beautiful city. Its domes and minarets gleaming 
      in the sunlight, next to newer more modern skyscrapers.   

                                  MOLLY
                    So many new buildings...                                                                    11-27-12     24.


                                  EMMA
                    How come there s no traffic? 

                                  SAMMY
                    They re holding it, stupid. See? 

      He points to a side street where men in uniform stand in 
      front of a long line of cars. HONKING. A SENSE OF UNREST.

                                  SAMMY (CONT D)
                    Because of us... 
                          (to Jamal)
                    ...right?

                                  JAMAL
                    That s right.

                                  SAMMY
                    Royalty, Emma. Royalty.

      Jamal and Sammy exchange a smile. They both like power.

      AS BARRY looks out the window, we go into HIS POV and see the 
      country the way he sees it: covered women huddling together; 
      poor people begging; children playing barefoot in a sewer.   

                                  SAMMY (CONT D)
                    Look, there s Grandpa. 

      A huge portrait of Hassan on the side of a building, staring 
      down at the people, like the most powerful man in the world -- 
      but its colors are faded from the strong Middle Eastern sun. 
      Off Barry, staring at the portrait as they pass...


      EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, GARDENS - DAY

        A beautiful, oriental palace on the outskirts of the city. 
      Surrounded by gorgeous gardens and lakes, the palace itself 
      is a sprawling complex adorned with domes, arches, mosaics. 

      HASSAN, now 71 and frail but still fierce, stands at the edge 
      of the garden overlooking the city, clutching a cane. His 
      wise, old eyes look out at his country. He hears VOICES --

                                  RAMZI (O.C.)
                    Mr. President, look who s here.

      -- and his face lights up. He turns to see Barry --

                                  HASSAN
                    Bassam!                                                                  11-27-12     25.


      -- Ramzi and Jamal approach. Barry walks over to his father. 
      Jamal watches with veiled jealous paranoia as they embrace.

                                  BARRY
                    Hello, father. You look well.  

                                  HASSAN
                    It s been so long. Too long. 

                                  BARRY
                    Between my business and the kids  
                      schedules, it s hard to manage --

                                  HASSAN
                    Is that what you ve been telling 
                    yourself? That you don t visit me 
                    because you re too busy? 

      As Barry takes that hit, a UNIFORMED GENERAL in his 50 s 
      walks over. Hassan bristles -- 

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    Are you blind, Ziad? Do you see I m 
                    in the middle of someting? 

                                  ZIAD
                    I m sorry to interrupt, Mr. 
                      President, but we ve just received 
                    new intelligence. From Ma an. It s 
                      time-sensitive. 

      Ziad restrains himself, awkward to reveal any more in front 
      of Barry. Hassan nods, realizes this requires his attention. 
      He looks at Barry who --

                                  BARRY
                    Go. I ll make sure the kids and 
                    Molly are settling in and we ll -- 

                                  HASSAN
                    No. Come. You should see this. 

                                  JAMAL
                    They re tired from the trip.

      Hassan doesn t look at Jamal; he just stays trained on Barry.

                                  HASSAN
                    No. I need both my sons with me 
                    now. Both of them. Come.  

      Hassan turns and goes without waiting for an answer, leaving 
      Jamal to give Barry a tight smile and they walk off together.                                                                   11-27-12     26.


                                  JAMAL
                          (not meaning it)
                    It s good you re here.

                                  BARRY
                          (not meaning it)
                    It s good to be here.


      INT. PRESIDENTIAL, OFFICE - DAY

      Hassan sits at the head of the table. He stares at the TV set 
      which is on but muted, playing IMAGES OF THE DEMONSTRATION we 
      saw from Fauzi s window: tires on fire; masked teenagers 
      throwing rocks. 

      WIDE SHOT: The room is packed with men. Some in uniform, some 
      in suits and some in Muslim garb, all of them smoke. Jamal 
      stands beside his father. Barry sits on the outer circle. 
      Hassan shakes his head wearily.

                                  HASSAN
                    Ma an. It s always Ma an...

                                  RAMZI
                          (to Ziad)
                    You said this was under control.

                                  ZIAD
                    It was. But several of our 
                      informants have reported the 
                      insurgents are planning an attack 
                    during the wedding. 

      Jamal is seething. 

                                  ZIAD (CONT D)
                      Apparently it was the elephants.

                                  JAMAL
                    These troublemakers think they can 
                    hold us hostage. I ll go in myself, 
                    with the Shabiha -- 

                                  RAMZI
                    Your thugs can t solve ALL the 
                    problems in this country --

                                  JAMAL
                    It s MY son s wedding! 

                                  RAMZI
                    Precisely their point.                                                                  11-27-12     27.


      Hassan looks at Barry to make sure he s clocking all this. 

                                  JAMAL
                    What do YOU propose we do? 

                                  RAMZI
                    Make a gesture. Free some prisoners 
                    as a gift to the people of Ma an-- 

                                  JAMAL
                    Bullshit. I say we impose a curfew, 
                    let the Shabiha go door to door -- 

                                  RAMZI
                    That s exactly what the Brotherhood 
                    wants. Exactly the excuse they need 
                    to start rioting. Do you want us to 
                    end up like Egypt, or Libya...?

                                  JAMAL
                    This is not like other countries, 
                    the people adore my father!  

                                  HASSAN
                          (sharply dismissive)
                    They don t adore me, they fear me.

      Hassan shakes off his distaste for Jamal s unctuousness, and 
      then falls into deeper thoughts, which he voices for Barry.

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    Or they used to. They barely fear 
                    me anymore. Now all they want is 
                    their precious  freedom  and 
                       democracy,  even though they have 
                    NO idea what those words mean... 
                    and no idea what it would cost 
                    them. 
                          (after a beat)
                    Nothing is simple anymore.  

                                  RAMZI
                    Your father is right. The people are 
                    calling this wedding corrupt, decadent. 
                    We need to show them we are at least 
                      listening. 

      Hassan rises, walks to the window. An expectant silence falls 
      over the room. When Hassan finally speaks, his voice is soft, 
      his demeanor commanding respect. His speech is mostly aimed 
      at explicating his dilemma for Barry.                                                                  11-27-12     28.


                                  HASSAN
                    If we make concessions, we appear 
                    weak and the Brotherhood wins. If 
                    we come down hard, we appear 
                    ruthless and the Brotherhood 
                    wins... Either way, we lose. 

                                  RAMZI
                    But if we do nothing... this call 
                    for democracy keeps spreading, like 
                    a cancer. If we don t stay ahead of 
                    it, it will consume us.

      Hassan sighs. He seems genuinely mournful. He turns to Barry.

                                  HASSAN
                    What do you think...?  

                                  BARRY
                    Me? 

                                  HASSAN
                    Yes. You. Tell me what you would 
                    do.

      Barry looks around and realizes he, oddly, has the floor.

                                  BARRY
                    I don t know.

                                  HASSAN
                    But what does common sense tell you 
                    I should do?
                          (off Barry s reticence)
                    Answer the question.

                                  BARRY
                      I suppose... I don t see the harm 
                    in meeting with the Brotherhood. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Yes, there s the American way! Hug 
                    it out!  It s all good!  Right...? 

      Jamal LAUGHS, looking around for support. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    Just like Obama!  It s all good! 

      Hassan raises his hand. Jamal shuts it. Hassan keeps looking 
      at Barry, unblinking.                                                                    11-27-12     29.


                                  HASSAN
                    And tell me what meeting them would  
                      accomplish.

      Again, Barry hesitates, but Hassan s look bids him continue -- 
      and everyone s watching -- Barry has to say SOMETHING.

                                  BARRY
                    It might take away their incentive 
                    to riot. At least until the wedding 
                    is over...? 

      A tense beat. Hassan turns to Jamal, who is OBVIOUSLY LIVID.

                                  HASSAN
                    Set up a meeting. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Father --

                                  HASSAN
                    And take your brother.

                                  JAMAL
                    As you wish.

      Jamal glares at Barry. OFF BARRY: HATING ALL THIS A LOT.


      INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

      Barry exits the office. He rubs his eyes as the door slams 
      behind him. He turns to see Jamal charging at him. 

                                  JAMAL
                    You think I don t know what you did 
                    in there? You want to play games?  

      Jamal grabs him hard and slams him against the wall.

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    You made a fool out of me! 

                                  BARRY
                    I didn t mean -- 

                                  JAMAL
                    Bullshit!

                                  BARRY
                    He asked me a question! I answered!                                                                  11-27-12     30.


                                  JAMAL
                    But you have no idea what s going 
                    on here, Bassam! No idea! 

                                  BARRY
                    I know! I m sorry. 

      Jamal loosens his grip and lets Barry slide down the wall. He 
      smiles. Warm. Creepy. He pats Barry on the shoulder.   

                                  JAMAL
                    Good. Welcome home.  

      And with that Jamal walks back into the office and slams the 
      door behind him. OFF BARRY: SHAKEN.


      EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - POOL - DAY

      Barry walks out of the palace, STILL SHAKEN, out to the 
      extravagant round pool overlooking the dusty, busy city. 

      Sammy stands under AN ORNATE FAKE WATERFALL in a BATHING 
      SUIT. OTHER WHITE KIDS, younger, play in the pool near him. 

                                  SAMMY
                    Why did you ever leave this place?
                          (after a dunk)
                    It s paradise!

      Barry goes to Molly, who sits with her legs in the water, 
      sipping iced tea beside another white woman -- DANA, 35, 
      blond, English. Emma sits on a chaise lounge behind her, 
      reading a book, sitting beside her chubby COUSIN RANYA, 13. 

                                  BARRY
                    We should go check in.

                                  SAMMY
                    Dad, we just got here! 

                                  MOLLY
                          (having fun)
                    We can stay a little bit, can t we? 
                          (re: Dana)
                    This is Dana, she s a cultural  
                    attache at the American Embassy.
                          (checking with Dana)
                    ...right?

                                  DANA
                    I mostly plan parties, but my 
                    husband and I are big supporters of 
                    your father.                                                                  11-27-12     31.


                                  BARRY
                    Nice to meet you.
                          (to Sammy)
                    Out of the pool! 

                                  MOLLY
                    Barry --

                                  BARRY
                          (to Dana)
                    SAMMY! LET S GO! NOW!

      OFF MOLLY: smiling a wifely smile at Dana. It s all good.  


      INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, OFFICE - DAY

      POV FROM ABOVE: Barry ushers his family from the pool area. 

      IN A WINDOW, HASSAN

      Watches Barry as the junta of men behind him keep arguing. 

      OFF HASSAN, CLOSE: he obviously has something in mind.


      INT. EMMA AND SAMMY S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

      A standard hotel room. Nothing fancy about it. Molly and 
      Barry dump the kids  bags onto the beds. 

                                  MOLLY
                    You guys ll be in here.

                                  BARRY
                    And we ll be right next door.

      Sammy flops onto the bad and looks at the room, GROSSED OUT.

                                  SAMMY
                          (sarcastic)
                    Yay! This is SO much better than 
                    the palace. Look, Em! A mini bar!  

                                  EMMA
                    Do I have to go to this thing?  

                                  MOLLY
                    It s a henna ceremony. We ll get 
                    our hands and feet painted. It s 
                    kind of a bachelorette party.                                                                  11-27-12     32.


                                  SAMMY
                    So the thing we re going to is like 
                      a bachelor party?

                                  BARRY
                    Yeah. Without the strippers. 

      Hearing this, Sammy gives Emma a mischievous, salacious look.  

                                  SAMMY
                    Bummer.

                                  MOLLY
                    We ll meet you guys in the lobby, 
                     kay? Half an hour. 

      Barry and Molly exit. Emma turns to Sammy, who s looking sly.

                                  EMMA
                          (a sincere warning)
                    Sammy, this isn t America. 

                                  SAMMY
                    Don t worry, I m not gonna sit on 
                    anyone s COCK. Not an purpose, 
                    anyway.

      OFF EMMA, as she starts to unpack. She worries about Sammy.


      INT. CELEBRATION HALL - NIGHT

      An ARAB WOMAN seductively sings the famous  Inta Omri  (You 
      are my love) a cappella. It s hypnotizing. 

      AN OLD SCARY VEILED WOMAN looks directly into camera. 

                                  OLD SCARY WOMAN
                    Give me your hand. 

      WIDE ANGLE: a beautifully arched hall lit by thousands of 
      candles. Emma and Molly, both dressed in ornate caftans sit 
      on the floor in front of the OLD WOMAN in a traditional dress 
      and a golden hijab. The woman is asking for Emma s hand.  

                                  EMMA
                          (to Molly, very unsure)
                    Show me yours again...?

      Molly displays her painted palms. Emma decides to endure it. 

                                  EMMA (CONT D)
                    Okay.                                                                  11-27-12     33.


      The old woman moves over and starts to work on Emma. Molly 
      looks over at Hiam who is talking to Leila. Leila wears a 
      simple black dress. Emma clocks Molly looking at Leila. 

                                  EMMA (CONT D)
                    You re as pretty as her.

                                  MOLLY
                          (piqued)
                    Why would you say that? 

                                  EMMA
                    Because. She and Dad were a thing.

                                  MOLLY
                    Who told you that? 

                                  EMMA
                    Ranya. At the pool. When they were 
                      teenagers. You didn t know that...?

      Molly smiles at her daughter -- and looks back at Leila. HUH. 


      INT. TURKISH BATH - NIGHT

      The hot room in a Turkish bath is... Hot. Really hot. 
      Unrelenting steam pours into the room. The dome decorated 
      with small glass windows creates a beautiful half light. 

      AHMED AL-FAHED, 18, the groom, is seated on the  Gbek , the 
      circular marble stone at the center of the room. Thick 
      shaving cream on his face. All the dozen men in the room have 
      nothing on but white towels. Barry holds Ahmed s head back 
      and brings a razor up to the bottom of his neck. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Are you sure you can see okay 
                    without your glasses? It would be 
                      unfortunate if my brother killed my 
                    son right before his wedding. 

      Everyone LAUGHS. Barry smiles, sheepishly. 

                                  BARRY
                    I see fine. Now -- where is he? 

      This gets a BIGGER LAUGH, which Jamal jealously clocks. Barry 
      wraps Ahmed s face in a HOT TOWEL. Sammy s gaze moves from 
      Barry to the beautiful DARK YOUNG MAN who is standing nearby. 
      The Dark Young Man notices Sammy s look and stares back.                                                                    11-27-12     34.


                                  JAMAL
                          (to Sammy)
                    You okay in this heat? You re not 
                    going to faint or anything?   

      Sammy realizes that Jamal is talking to him and quickly -

                                  SAMMY
                    No, I m great. Thanks.   

      Jamal smiles, playing the good uncle, and looks away. Sammy 
      looks back at the man who is still looking at him. Hmmm.  

                                  JAMAL
                    Bassam! Come with me. 

      Sammy clocks Jamal s authoritarian tone with Barry with 
      admiration as Jamal walks away from the group. Barry follows. 
      The two walk through a corridor towards an adjacent hot room.  

                                  BARRY
                    Where are we going? 

                                  JAMAL
                          (with an edge)
                    The meeting you wanted to have. 

                                  BARRY
                    With the Brotherhood?

                                  JAMAL
                    Yes.

                                  BARRY
                    Here? Now? 

                                  JAMAL
                    Yes. And try not to speak this 
                    time. Listen.


      INT. TURKISH BATH, HOT ROOM #2 - NIGHT

      This room is even hotter than the other one. It s hard to see 
      through the thick steam. Barry and Jamal walk through steam 
      until they are standing in front of - 

      A very dressed Ramzi, standing next to six very dressed 
      people in the steam room. WALID ABU WAEL, 55, the leader, 
      addresses Jamal with tightly-performed obeisance.

                                  WALID
                    Salam aleikum.                                                                  11-27-12     35.


                                  JAMAL
                    Salam aleikum.
                          (after a beat)
                    My apologies, Walid, but I m in the 
                    process of getting my son ready for 
                    his wedding day. It s a busy time.

                                  WALID
                    Of course. We understand. 

      Walid s face is already red from the heat. Jamal raises his 
      hand. Walid leans in and kisses it. 

                                  JAMAL
                    My brother, Bassam.... 

                                  BASSAM
                    ...salam aleikum. 

                                  WALID
                    Salam aleikum.

      The other men profusely sweat in their suits. Jamal loves it.

                                  JAMAL
                    My father is worried, very worried, 
                    about the unrest in Ma an. These 
                    recent demonstrations -- 

                                  WALID
                    -- were not my doing. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Don t bullshit me. We know you re 
                    behind these attacks. 

                                  WALID
                    I have nothing to do with the 
                    violence, Jamal, you have my word.  
                    You can t blame me if the people 
                    are angry. They re poor, hungry -- 

      Jamal drops his towel. Naked, he stands in front of them --

                                  JAMAL
                    You have a son, don t you? 
                          (getting no answer)
                    Don t you, Walid?

      He walks to the fountain. He fills a pot with ice cold water 
      and pours it over his body. Walid wipes sweat off his brow. 

                                  WALID
                    Three.                                                                   11-27-12     36.


                                  JAMAL
                    And you love them? You love them?

      Walid stares at him: IT S A VERY TENSE MOMENT. 

                                  WALID
                    Are you threatening me?

                                  JAMAL
                    No. Of course not. I m asking about 
                    your family. It s so important. 

      Jamal turns his back. Walid looks to Ramzi, who gives Walid a 
      look back: he didn t know this was coming, either. The 
      meeting is over. Walid and the six men, drenched in sweat, 
      storm out. Jamal walks back over to Ramzi and Barry.

                                  RAMZI
                    I m not sure upsetting the 
                      Brotherhood was wise. Your father 
                      specifically asked that -- 

      And then we hear a SOUND. Ramzi looks down. Jamal, with a 
      dead look on his face, is pissing on the floor.

      ON RAMZI S SHOES

      As the pool of piss grows nearby, and the last drip drops.

      ON RAMZI

      Accepting this with vicious equanimity. He nods and exits.

      ON BARRY

      Looking past Jamal to the window into the adjoining room.

      BARRY S POV

      Where SAMMY is watching this go down, AWED AND IMPRESSED.

      IN A WIDER SHOT

      Jamal takes a deep breath, pushes his hair backwards with his 
      hand. He looks at Barry and suddenly laughs a little. 

                                  JAMAL
                          (to Barry)
                    ...what?

      OFF BARRY: the trip is going like he thought it would. Badly.                                                                  11-27-12     37.


      INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

      Barry and Sammy ride the elevator in silence.


      INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      The silence continues as Barry and Sammy walk to their rooms. 
      Sammy reaches his door, fishes out his key. Barry finally 
      manages to say what he s wanted to say -- 

                                  BARRY
                    I m sorry you had to see that.

                                  SAMMY
                    I m not. 

      Sammy opens the door. 

                                  SAMMY (CONT D)
                    If you saw the shit that goes down 
                    in the locker room at school...? 
                    That was NOTHING.

      Sammy enters his room, closes the door. Leaving Barry alone 
      in the corridor. He stands there for a long beat. 


      INT. BARRY AND MOLLY S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

      Without turning on the light, Barry enters, sees Molly 
      apparently asleep in bed. He sits on the chair near the bed, 
      unties his shoes and slips them off. 

                                  MOLLY
                    How was it? 

                                  BARRY
                    Fine. My brother s insane. 

      BEAT. Barry unties his shoes and slips them off. Barry 
      continues undressing, pulls out his wallet and cellphone, 
      which he checks for a message. Nothing. Molly is watching him 
      from her pillow.

                                  MOLLY
                    Any word from the bank?

                                  BARRY
                    Not yet.

                                  MOLLY
                    Huh. And Fauzi still hasn t called?                                                                  11-27-12     38.


                                  BARRY
                    No.

                                  MOLLY
                    You should just go see him 
                    tomorrow. We have the whole day 
                    free before the wedding. 

                                  BARRY
                    Maybe.

      Finally, Molly says what s really on her mind.

                                  MOLLY
                    If you want, you can also catch up 
                    with Leila.

      WTF? Barry stops what he was doing.

                                  BARRY
                    What?

                                  MOLLY
                    You and Leila. You were a couple, 
                    right?

                                  BARRY
                    We were never a couple. We were -- 
                          (after a beat)
                    Why are you asking me this?

                                  MOLLY
                    Were you a couple or not?

                                  BARRY
                          (after a beat, fumbling)
                    Yes. But it was a long time ago and 
                    it never became a -- thing --

                                  MOLLY
                    Why didn t you ever tell me?

                                  BARRY
                    I didn t think it mattered.

      Barry rises and goes to the bed, sits down by Molly. He 
      touches her face, runs his hand through her hair. 

                                  MOLLY
                          (sweetly vulnerable)
                    Is she why you didn t want to come?

      Barry feels a wave of affection for his wife.                                                                  11-27-12     39.


                                  BARRY
                    I didn t want to come because this part 
                    of my life is over. My life is with you 
                    and the kids. All I m doing, Molly, the 
                    whole time we re here, is waiting to 
                    get back home. 

                                  MOLLY
                    Promise? 

                                  BARRY
                    Promise.

      Barry leans in and kisses her softly and pulls away. They 
      look at each other. She reaches out and pulls him down to her 
      again and they kiss more passionately. 


      INT. BARRY AND MOLLY S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

      Molly sleeps soundly, but Barry remains wide awake. He turns 
      his head, puts on his glasses -- sees it s 4:35. He takes off 
      his glasses, closes his eyes... trying to fall asleep... then 
      opens them. No good. He slips quietly out of bed.


      EXT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - NIGHT

      Barry, his face somewhat obscured by a HOODIE sweatshirt, 
      climbs into a cab. As the cab pulls onto the mostly empty 
      streets of the commercial district, the first ribbon of light 
      is visible on the horizon. Dawn is breaking.


      INT. BARRY S TAXI - DAY

      We are no longer in the fancy part of town. Barry stares 
      through the window, sees the poverty here. People live in 
      shameful crowded conditions. The sewer runs in the street 
      where barefoot kids are kicking an old bottle of Coke. 
      PUSHING IN on Barry -- SMASH CUT TO -- 


      INT. PRESIDENTIAL CAR - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]

      Hassan, in full uniform, is driving the car. Ramzi by his 
      side. They speed down the bumpy, unpaved road. Jamal and 
      Bassam are in the back seat. They look frightened. 

      Bassam s POV: A pickup speeds in front of the Mercedes. It s 
      packed with armed Shabiha, holding BIG GUNS and MACHETES.

      Bassam looks back to see the MILITARY CARS behind them. Same 
      thing. Trigger happy men hang from the sides of the cars.                                                                   11-27-12     40.


                                  HASSAN
                    See that light...? 

                                  RAMZI
                    We re almost there.

      Bassam looks out the window at the DIM LIGHT shining from the 
      other side of the hill. OFF BASSAM --


      EXT. STREETS OF ASIMA - DAY (PRESENT)

      The taxi has pulled up before a mosque. Barry gets out. Pays 
      the driver. The taxi pulls away. ON BARRY: looking up at the 
      mosque with apprehension. Struck by the stark beauty of the 
      minaret reaching toward the morning sky...


      INT. MOSQUE - DAY

      The murmur of many voices united in prayer precedes Barry as 
      he enters the hall where rows and rows of men are praying. 
      It s very crowded. They all have their back to him.

      ON BARRY: as the beauty and communality of this humility 
      before God settles on him. He s missed this depth.

      And then his reverie is broken by WHISPERS. He looks to see 
      the scandalized stares of a few men who have spotted him. 

      Ignoring them uneasily, he takes a few steps forward. More 
      people stop praying and stare. The WHISPER spreads like fire. 

      He bravely makes his way towards the first row where Fauzi is 
      deep in prayer, his eyes shut, leaning back and forth. 

      It now seems like EVERYONE in the room is staring at him. No 
      one moves but it feels dangerous. It feels pre-lynch. 

      Sensing the energy change in the room, Fauzi opens his eyes. 
      He looks back and sees Barry. Their eyes meet. Fauzi gets up 
      abruptly, grabs Barry by the elbow and walks out the back. 


      EXT. MOSQUE, BACKYARD - DAY

      Fauzi and Barry step out to a small backyard. 

                                  FAUZI
                    What the hell are you doing here?

                                  BARRY
                    You ve been ignoring my calls.                                                                   11-27-12     41.


                                  FAUZI
                    So you walk into a mosque filled 
                    with people who hate your family?
                          (after a beat)
                    You crazy? You want to get killed? 

                                  BARRY
                      I wouldn t mind some tea.  

      Despite himself, Fauzi smiles, shakes his head. 

                                  FAUZI
                    Come.


      INT. FAUZI S HOUSE - DAY

      Fauzi pours Moroccan tea into a glass as Barry stands at the 
      window, looking out at the city, feeling NOSTALGIC. 

                                  BARRY
                    The smell of the air here...
                    I dream about it sometimes. I miss 
                    it.

      Fauzi smiles mordantly at such innocence and walks over and 
      hands Barry his teacup and stands by him, looking out.

                                  BARRY (CONT D)
                    Remember we climbed that tree, when 
                    we were boys?

                                  FAUZI
                    To see your father s motorcade pass 
                    through town, when he took power.  

      ACROSS THE STREET

      There s a tall tree.

                                  FAUZI (CONT D)
                    Your family was from here. We were 
                    all so proud.
                          (after a beat)
                    We re not so proud anymore.

                                  BARRY
                    Fauzi. You have to --

                                  FAUZI
                    What?                                                                  11-27-12     42.


                                  BARRY
                    You have to temper your criticism of 
                    my father. For a while, at least. 

                                  FAUZI
                    They sent you here to tell me this? 
                    Is this the government talking?

                                  BARRY
                    No, this is me. Your friend.

                                  FAUZI
                    Who comes here to threaten me?

                                  BARRY
                    No, to warn you. My father and his 
                    people... they re losing patience. 

                                  FAUZI
                    But I am the only one, Bassam, 
                    speaking the truth about this 
                    regime. Your father is a murderer; 
                    your brother is worse -- 

                                  BARRY
                    Fauzi, I m not going to debate the 
                    behavior of a family I ve done 
                      everything to get away from. I m 
                    just here to tell you: stop.

                                  FAUZI
                    Jamal breaks into people s homes 
                    and does whatever he wants. To the 
                    men. Women. Children. He s obsessed 
                    with this woman from Abu Romana 
                    now. I know her husband --

                                  BARRY
                    Why are you telling me this...?!  

                                  FAUZI
                    Because they re your family, you 
                    idiot! You bear a moral 
                      responsibility for their actions.

                                  BARRY
                    Fauzi. I am an eye doctor. I live 
                    in Orlando, Florida. 

                                  FAUZI
                    AND you are an Al-Fahed.

                                  BARRY
                    Who s here for his nephew s wedding.                                                                   11-27-12     43.


                                  FAUZI
                    You think it s that simple? By 
                    running away -- by staying away as 
                    long as you have -- you become just 
                    as guilty as them.

      Barry is a bit astounded at his old friend s vehemence.

                                  BARRY
                    Really?

                                  FAUZI
                    Really.

      Pinned by Fauzi, Barry searches for a way through this.

                                  BARRY
                    What do you expect me to do?

                                  FAUZI
                    Accept your responsibility to this 
                    country. And to me.

                                  BARRY
                    Why do you think I came here? As 
                    for the country...this isn t my 
                    country anymore.

                                  FAUZI
                    Isn t it? Your family is swimming 
                    in the pool at the palace. You re 
                    traveling to Ma an to deliver a 
                    gentle warning to one of the 
                    leaders of the democracy movement. 
                    You dream at night about the air.
                          (after a beat)
                    This is your home, Bassam. It s where 
                    you re from. It s who you are. You 
                    can t run from you who you are.

      OFF BARRY: UNNERVED BY FAUZI S WORDS. He looks out the window 
      to avoid the continued look from Fauzi. Shakes off a shiver.


      EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - COURTYARD - NIGHT

      2,000 GUESTS mill in the tree-lined grounds of the palace to 
      The Royal Philharmonic playing traditional Muslim music. 

      Hassan stands at the head of the receiving line, talking 
      amiably with Dana and her husband, whom we ll meet in a few 
      moments, a vaguely debonair bureaucrat, JOHN TUCKER.                                                                  11-27-12     44.


      There are MANY WHITE AMERICANS AND EUROPEANS present, all of 
      them tied to various oil-related or military-industrial work.

      IN ANOTHER AREA, Jamal, Leila, and Ahmed joke around with the 
      Crown Prince of Morocco and Spain s Queen Sofia.  

      AT A TABLE, Emma sits between Molly and Barry. Molly is 
      wearing the sleeveless black dress she tried on earlier. 
      Barry notices the henna patterns on Emma s hand.

                                  BARRY
                    Pretty.

                                  EMMA
                    Yeah. I love my little temporary 
                    cattle brand. Moo.

      A WOMAN walks over to Molly and hands her A DARK SHAWL. 

                                  MOLLY
                          (smiles)
                    What s this? 

      The Woman points across the way to Hiam. Hiam smiles at Molly 
      and animates covering the shoulders with the shawl. 

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    Of course. 
                          (to the Woman)
                    Shukran. 

      She dons it. The Woman goes. Molly turns to look at Barry. 

                                  BARRY
                          (with a smile)
                    Toldja.


      ON THE DANCE FLOOR

      Sammy, with a few of his cousins, is learning a traditional 
      dance when he spots the DARK YOUNG MAN sitting by himself. 

      Sammy separates himself from the group and walks over. 

                                  SAMMY
                    Anyone sitting here? 

      The man is about to answer but Sammy already sits down.

                                  SAMMY (CONT D)
                    I m Sammy. Bassam s --                                                                  11-27-12     45.


                                  YOUNG MAN
                    I know who you are.
                          (points at himself)
                    Abdul.

      Sammy looks out at the festivities, then back to Abdul.

                                  SAMMY
                    What s your connection..?

                                  ABDUL
                    My father is your grandfather s 
                    head of security. My grandfather 
                    was the head of security to your 
                      great-grandfather and my great-
                      grandfather was head of security to 
                    your great-great --

                                  SAMMY
                    I get it. I was just making sure 
                    we re not related. 

                                  ABDUL
                    We re not. But we are -- involved.

                                  SAMMY
                          (flirtatious)
                    Go on.

                                  ABDUL
                    I ve been assigned to keep you out 
                    of trouble. My father had a feeling 
                    that if you were allowed to wander 
                    freely, you might end up dead.

      BEAT. It settles on Sammy that he might be identified by the 
      powers that be as gay. But he opts for bravado and moves on; 
      after all, Abdul is adorable and the night is young.

                                  SAMMY
                          (making light of it)
                    Well. Now I feel very safe.

      Abdul smiles at that. OFF SAMMY: WONDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT. 


      LATER

      The BRIDE enters, covered in white, with FOUR BRIDESMAIDS, 
      also in white. The women yell, the men clap and whistle. 

      GUN SHOTS! The guards and the guests shoot pistols into the 
      air, aiming up and pulling the trigger. A SENSE OF CHAOS.                                                                  11-27-12     46.


      LATER STILL, ON THE DANCE FLOOR

      Rows of men, hugging each other s shoulders, dance the 
      traditional Debka dance. It s loud, celebratory, festive. 

      Barry hugs Ramzi who hugs Hassan who hugs Jamal etc... Ramzi 
      switches positions with Barry. Now, Hassan is hugging both 
      his sons on either side of him. He seems happy. 

      The dancing speeds up... Leg up, leg down, left.. Right.. And 
      turn and again... Laughter. Noise. Left. Right. 

      Random GUNSHOTS. Women YELL from the sides. 

      The bride is in midair, on someone s shoulders. SCREAMS of 
      joy. Faster dancing. It s a claustrophobic scene. Jamal lifts 
      Ahmed up on his shoulders. The musicians POUND the darbuka 
      (goblet) drums faster and faster. 

      ON BARRY, CLOSE, as he dances in the midst of the dizzy mess. 
      Pale. Sweaty. Out of breath. As MORE GUNSHOTS GO OFF --


      EXT. MA'AN STREET - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]

      The boys are alone in the car, looking out the window at 
      ABSOLUTE CHAOS. As we PUSH IN ON THEM, we see FIRE REFLECTED 
      IN THE WINDOW, and their frozen blank expressions hint at the 
      horror they are witnessing. The noise is unbearable: SCREAMS. 

      BARRY S POV

      FIRE. Women and children running from the carnage. The 
      Shabiha chase people up and down the streets. Some are gunned 
      down from behind; some children are slashed with machetes.   

      A DOZEN MEN, some of them as young as 10 and as old as 70 are 
      lined up against a wall across from the Mercedes. Frightened, 
      crying, some with their pants showing fresh urine stains, too 
      scared to move. MILITARY MEN have guns trained on them. 

      A YOUNG BOY runs, ROCK IN HAND, hysterically toward Bassam in 
      the car window. GUNSHOT. Blood squirts from his eye onto the 
      window as he falls right in front of Bassam s little face.  

      Hassan walks into frame, PISTOL IN HAND. He stands between 
      the car and the frightened men. He raises his hand towards 
      Jamal. His fingers curl backwards. He s waving him to join 
      him. Bassam looks at Jamal. We hear: A TELEPHONE RING.                                                                   11-27-12     47.


      EXT. ROYAL PALACE - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

      Barry, with Emma standing beside him looking bored, takes the 
      ringing phone out of his pocket, holds up a finger -- be 
      right back! -- and slips away to a - 

      QUIETER SPOT, overlooking the city, and covers one ear. 

                                  BARRY
                    Hello? 

                                  BANKER (O.S.)
                    Mr. Al-Fahed? Barry? 

                                  BARRY
                    Yes, this is he...?

                                  BANKER (O.S.)
                    Barry, it s Fred. From First 
                    National. Is this a good time? 

      BACK WHERE EMMA S STANDING  

      She sees Sammy and Abdul enter the main house. She s WORRIED. 

      BACK ON BARRY, PHONE TO ONE EAR, COVERING THE OTHER 

      Barry looks over at his father, Hassan, dancing now with a 6 
      year old grandchild, amidst cheering family members.

                                  BANKER (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    ...hello? Is this a good time?

                                  BARRY
                    Oh hi! Yes. It s a great time.

      Barry takes a few more steps away from the dancers.

                                  BANKER (O.S.)
                    Well... The good news is the 
                    committee approved your loan.

                                  BARRY
                    All of it? The $80,000? 

                                  BANKER (O.S.)
                    Yes. That wife of yours put the 
                    fear of God in me. I wasn t about 
                    to let her down. But before we can 
                    release the funds, I need you to 
                    come in and sign some paperwork. 

      Barry sees Emma head off after Sammy, but he doesn t know 
      where she s going. She distracts him from the call.                                                                  11-27-12     48.


                                  BANKER (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    ...Barry?

                                  BARRY 
                      Anything... yes, of course!  

      OFF BARRY, watching Emma head toward the main house.


      INT. PALACE HALLWAY TO THE BATHROOMS - NIGHT

      Emma comes around the corner --

                                  EMMA
                      ...Sammy...?

      -- just as she sees Sammy and Abdul enter the men s room. 
      SHIT. She shakes her head with fatalistic consternation and 
      goes into the women s bathroom and the door shuts behind her.


      INT. BATHROOM STALLS - NIGHT

      BIRD S EYE VIEW on Sammy and Abdul locked in a kiss, they 
      make out, quickly pulling each other s shirts off. 

      The CAMERA TRACKS RIGHT, crossing into THE LADIES ROOM, 
      settling over a stall where Emma is sitting on a golden 
      toilet bowl, grudgingly admiring her henna-ed hands.

      Then SHE HEARS: the DOOR to the room slam open; Jamal s 
      LAUGHTER, followed by a soft WHIMPERING. Emma stands, pulls 
      up her underwear, looks through the crack in the stall -- 

      EMMA S STALL-CRACK POV

      Jamal is pushing the BRIDE, NUSRAT against the sink.

                                  JAMAL
                          (in Arabic)
                    He s a good boy, Ahmed. You love him? 

      She nods frantically, SCARED. He leans against her.  

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                          (in Arabic)
                    That s good. 
                          (into the mirror, at her)
                    Ahmed chose wisely. You re beautiful. 

      He roughly slaps one big palm over her face. His other hand 
      moves down onto her breasts, scoops them out of her dress and 
      bra. She squints in pain, tears filling her eyes.                                                                     11-27-12     49.


      ON EMMA S FACE

      Through the crack in the stall door: TERRIFIED. Emma stares, 
      trying not to make a sound.  

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                          (in Arabic)
                    The wedding night is very special. 

      Jamal lifts Nusrat s dress exposing her legs. She s wearing 
      white underwear. Tears now streaming down her face. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    It s important to be pure. 

      He holds his other hand up, shows her three middle fingers. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    Don t worry, we re all family here. 

      Jamal shoves his hand down into Nusrat s underwear. She 
      YELPS. Jamal covers her mouth with his free hand and pushes 
      up against her, obviously pressing his cock against her too. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    Yeah... There it is... 

                                  NUSRAT
                          (in pain)
                    AHHH!

      Jamal pulls his hand out and holds it up: it s BLOODY. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Good girl. 

      He wipes the tears off her face with the bloody hand.  

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    Very good girl.

      He exits. Nusrat leans over the sink and sobs. Emma blanches.

      EMMA S POV

      Nusrat s hand, painted with henna patterns, just like hers. 

      ON EMMA

      She looks down at her own hand again and feels revulsion. A 
      SOB from Nusrat draws her sympathetic attention back again. 

      OFF EMMA: MARKED FOR LIFE BY WHAT SHE JUST SAW.                                                                  11-27-12     50.


      EXT. ROYAL PALACE - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

      Barry is finishing his phone conversation.  

                                  BARRY
                    Yes! Yes, look, I really appreciate 
                    this, Fred, and I will personally 
                    invite you and your wife to the 
                    opening of the new store! 

      Barry notices JOHN TUCKER, Dana s husband, approaching.  

                                  BARRY (CONT D)
                    Yes, new glasses for all the kids!  
                          (after a beat)
                    I will! Bye!

      He hangs up and pockets the phone as the man arrives.

                                  JOHN TUCKER
                    Mr. Al-Fahed?

                                  BARRY
                    Yes...?

                                  JOHN TUCKER
                    John Tucker. American Embassy. I 
                    think you met my wife, Dana...

                                  BARRY
                    Oh, yeah. At the pool. Yeah.

      They shake hands and gaze out at the opulence.

                                  JOHN TUCKER
                    The stability of our relationship 
                    with your father over the years -- 
                    it s been a great relief during 
                    these turbulent times. Huge. 

                                  BARRY
                          (with some awareness)
                    I can imagine.

                                  JOHN TUCKER
                    I mean, we all want democracy. But 
                    there s a time for everything. And 
                    when it comes to making the 
                      transition, some people are better 
                    at managing it than others. 

      Tucker subtly pulls a CARD from his jacket pocket.                                                                  11-27-12     51.


                                  JOHN TUCKER (CONT D)
                    When you get back to the states, 
                    give me a call. We should talk.

                                  BARRY
                    About what...?

                                  JOHN TUCKER
                    Whatever. Your family. The future.

      Barry takes the card and he and Tucker exchange a look. As 
      Tucker clears, Molly walks up, looking VERY DISTRAUGHT.

                                  BARRY
                    What? What s the matter?

                                  MOLLY
                    Your father.

      ON THE DANCE FLOOR

      Barry pushes through the thick crowd and sees --

      Hassan lies on the floor. His eyes open. Foam coming out of 
      his mouth, convulsing. A DOZEN BODYGUARDS surround him. Ramzi 
      kneels next to him, BARKING orders. The bodyguards lift 
      Hassan and rush him away to a car near by. 

      Everyone runs around Barry, but he s completely frozen. He 
      raises his gaze. Jamal is standing across from him. They 
      stare at each other for a long beat.  


      INT. AL-FAHED HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      The wide corridor is full of people and nervous MUMBLING. 
      Barry sits by his family, still in their wedding attire. He s 
      holding Hiam s hand, and looking down the hall at --  

      BARRY S POV OF JAMAL AND RAMZI, FROM A DISTANCE

      Talking intensely. Jamal is SMOKING. 

                                  RAMZI
                    We need to prepare a statement. 

                                  JAMAL
                    No! No one can know about this. 

                                  RAMZI
                    Everyone already knows. We need to 
                    control the rumors. We ll release 
                    something vague. Food poisoning. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                  11-27-12     52.

                                  RAMZI (CONT'D)
                    The president is hospitalized but 
                    is expected to fully recover.

      ON MOLLY AND BARRY, TURNING BACK TO EACH OTHER

                                  MOLLY
                    Is he allowed to smoke in here?

      She looks at Barry who shakes his head, saying  leave it . 

      EMMA AND SAMMY

      Emma s WITHDRAWN; poking at her CELL PHONE.

                                  SAMMY
                          (whispers to Emma)
                    What s up with you? 

                                  EMMA
                    Nothing. My coverage is for shit.

                                  SAMMY
                          (as if it s cool)
                    They blocked it out, I bet. When 
                    Grandpa had the stroke.

      She looks across the hallway at Nusrat, the bride, sitting in 
      front of her, still in her white dress, looking miserable. 

                                  EMMA
                    I want to go home.  

      Just then, the door to Hassan s room opens. The doctor walks 
      out to the corridor. All but Barry rise and gather round him.  

                                  MOLLY
                          (whispers)
                    Go. 

      Barry gets up and joins them. Hiam follows. 

                        JAMAL*HIAM*
      How is he?*When can I talk to him? *

                                  DOCTOR
                    The president has suffered a 
                    massive cerebrovascular injury. 

                                  HIAM
                    Another stroke...?

                                  DOCTOR
                    Yes. And a very serious one.                                                                  11-27-12     53.


                                  JAMAL
                    So what are you going to do? 

      The Doctor looks at him, scared. 

                                  DOCTOR
                    Uh, there s really nothing more we 
                    can do at this point, we have to --

      Jamal pounces on the doctor, grabbing him by the neck, 
      throwing him against the wall. Everyone pulls him off. 

                                  HIAM
                    Jamal! Stop it!

      Jamal steps back, tears filling his eyes -- 

                                  JAMAL
                    Such bullshit!

                                  DOCTOR
                            (breathless)
                    I m sorry. 

      The Doctor swallows; regains his composure; looks at Barry.

                                  DOCTOR (CONT D)
                    He wants to see you.

                                  BARRY
                    Me?

                                  DOCTOR
                    Yes. He s asking for you. 

      Jamal looks with RAGE at Barry. OFF BARRY: NOT WANTING THIS.


      INT. HASSAN S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

      The room is dark. Somber. A single hospital bed. Barry walks 
      in and approaches the bed slowly, hesitantly. 

      Barry s POV: his father, weaker than we ve ever seen, looks 
      small and fragile in the wide hospital bed. He s attached to 
      IVs and hospital devices monitoring him. 

      Hassan slowly moves his head and sees Barry. He tries to say 
      something but barely manages an inaudible mumble.

                                  BARRY
                    It s okay. Don t try to talk.                                                                     11-27-12     54.


      Hassan swallows hard, saliva on his chin. He gestures for 
      Barry to come closer. Barry does. Hassan grabs Barry s hand. 

                                  HASSAN
                          (weak)
                    I made... I made a mistake. 

                                  BARRY
                    Dad, rest. We can talk later. 

                                  HASSAN
                    No. We must -- there s no time.
                          (looking in Barry s eyes)
                    It s you, Bassam. You.

                                  BARRY
                    No.

                                  HASSAN
                    Yes...

      Hassan, with the last of his strength, squeezes Barry s hand.

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    Your... destiny is here. You can t 
                    keep... running... You... It s you. 
                    Not Jamal. You. My big... Mistake. 

      Hassan falls back onto the pillow. A NOISE makes Barry turn 
      back and it s only then that he sees that Jamal has been 
      standing in the doorway -- stunned -- he heard it all -- 

                                  BARRY
                    Jamal --

      Jamal rushes out of the room. Barry runs after him as NURSES 
      and the DOCTOR rush past him into the room.


      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Barry rushes into the corridor and sees Jamal down the hall, 
      in the opposite direction from the family. Barry catches up.

                                  BARRY
                    Jamal --

      Jamal spins and grabs Barry by the collar, his eyes filled 
      with tears, slams him against the wall. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Why did you come here?                                                                  11-27-12     55.


                                  BARRY
                    What do you mean? 

                                  JAMAL
                    Answer me! Why did you come? Did he 
                    ask you to come? Did Ramzi?

                                  BARRY
                    I came for Ahmed s wedding!

                                  JAMAL
                    Bullshit! You don t give a shit 
                    about my son! I know why you came. 
                    But it s not going to work. It s 
                    me, little brother. It doesn t 
                    matter what that old man thought. 
                    It s me. I m the one.  

      Jamal slams Barry against the wall VERY HARD. Both brothers 
      look down the hall and see the family and Ramzi watching. 

      ON JAMAL AND BARRY

      As Jamal suddenly shifts in his insane way.

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    I love you. 

      Jamal suddenly hugs him. Strong. Violent. Without softening: 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    You know that right? I love you.

      He gives Barry a kiss on the lips, squeezing his head in. 
      Barry pulls back but his strength is nothing compared to 
      Jamal s. It lasts a few sick moments and then Jamal pushes 
      him back against the wall and walks off, down the hall --

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    OUT OF MY WAY!

      -- through the family -- and away. Ramzi takes a few steps 
      down the hall and looks at Barry, who s still SHAKEN. Then 
      Leila steps out of Hassan s room, walks past Ramzi to Barry.

                                  LEILA
                    He s gone. 

      Hiam cries out and turns and rushes into the room, where the 
      Doctor is now standing in the doorway to lead her in. Leila, 
      her eyes dry but still shaken by the gravity of what s in 
      play, walks into Barry s arms. OFF BARRY: looking over her 
      shoulder, uneasily, at Molly.                                                                   11-27-12     56.


      INT. BARRY AND MOLLY S HOTEL ROOM  - NIGHT

      As Barry tears open the closet, Molly and the kids watch TV, 
      sitting like disaster victims on the edge of the bed. 

                                  MOLLY
                    It s on CNN. Everyone s guessing 
                    Jamal is going to become president.

                                  SAMMY
                    Is he...?

                                  BARRY
                    I don t know and I don t care.

      Barry tosses the SUITCASE violently onto the bed.

                                  MOLLY
                    What are you doing?

                                  BARRY
                    We re leaving. Pack your bags. Now. 

                                  EMMA
                    Yes!

                                  MOLLY
                    What are you talking about? 

      She mutes the TV as Emma heads for the door.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    Emma, wait. 

                                  EMMA
                    What?

                                  MOLLY
                    Barry. Your family needs you now. 

                                  BARRY
                    They aren t my family. You are my 
                    family. How many times do I have to 
                    say it?
                          (to Emma and Sammy)
                    Go to your room and pack.

                                  SAMMY
                    I want to stay. 

                                  EMMA
                    Sammy, do what Dad says!                                                                  11-27-12     57.


                                  SAMMY
                    Shut the fuck up, Emma, you re not 
                    my fucking mother!

                                  BARRY
                    Go! Go to your room and pack! NOW!

                                  SAMMY
                    NO! I ll stay with Jamal -- if you 
                    were half the man that he is --  

      WHACK! Barry SLAPS Sammy s face. HARD. The SLAP surprises 
      even Barry, even though he gave it. Sammy grabs his red 
      cheek. Tears fill his eyes. For a long moment, no one moves. 

                                  BARRY
                    Go pack your bags. Now. 

      Sammy runs out of the room and Emma follows. Molly looks at 
      Barry with a combination of wifely indignation and FEAR.  

                                  MOLLY
                    What is the MATTER with you? 

                                  BARRY
                    It s this place. Trust me. We need 
                    to get out of here. 

                                  MOLLY
                    So we re not even staying for the 
                    funeral? Your father s funeral?

                                  BARRY
                    No. We re going. 

      RACK FOCUS TO MOLLY as Barry piles clothes into his suitcase.


      INT. INTERCONTINENTAL - LOBBY - NIGHT

      BING! The elevator doors open. Barry is the first one out, 
      carrying two bags on his shoulders. Molly, Emma and Sammy 
      hurry behind, trying to keep up. As he passes the front desk:

                                  CLERK
                    Mr. Al-Fahed...?

      But Barry just keeps walking to the door, family in tow.


      EXT. INTERCONTINENTAL, LOBBY - NIGHT

      Barry walks to a TAXI DRIVER, smoking outside his taxi. He 
      drops the bags at his feet.                                                                   11-27-12     58.


                                  BARRY
                          (to the driver)
                    The trunk. There are four of us.

      The driver opens the trunk and helps with the luggage. THREE 
      ARMED BODYGUARDS (one of whom is ABDUL) hurry over as Molly 
      and the kids give their bags to the taxi driver.

                                  BODYGUARD
                    Sir, if you need to go somewhere, 
                    we can take you, this is our job --

                                  BARRY
                    We re fine. Thank you very much for 
                    all your help. Thank you.
                          (to his family)
                    Get in.

      They do. He gets in the front seat and slams the front door. 
      The BODYGUARDS are outside Barry s window. One of them is 
      talking on his cell phone, obviously about Barry leaving.   

                                  BARRY (CONT D)
                          (to driver)
                    Airport, please. 

      THROUGH THE CLOSED WINDOW, Sammy and Abdul trade looks -- 
      neither one is happy about this, but only Sammy shows it.

                                  BARRY (O.C.) (CONT D) 
                    AIRPORT! NOW! GO!

      The driver nods; pulls out. OFF BARRY: DESPERATE TO ESCAPE. 


      EXT. SLUMS - NIGHT

      Jamal s Ferrari comes to a screeching halt in front of the 
      dilapidated two-story building.  


      INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

      The kids huddle together on mattresses, to keep warm. The 
      noise from the outside has woken Hamid who jumps to his feet. 
      He runs to the window and looks down -- 

      HAMID S POV

      Jamal stumbles out of the car with TWO GOONS.

                                  HAMID
                    It s him.                                                                  11-27-12     59.


      He turns to see Fatma, in a t-shirt and underwear, standing 
      in the doorway. SOUNDS in the stairway. She looks at Hamid, 
      frightened. He grabs her and pulls her into the bathroom. He 
      opens the cupboard, and pulls out the SMALL BOX. He opens it 
      and takes out a SYRINGE. 

                                  HAMID (CONT D)
                    Empty this anywhere in his body. It 
                    doesn t matter where. 

      She nods. They rush out to the --

      BEDROOM

      -- where Fatma hides the syringe under the pillow.  

                                  FATMA
                    They ll kill you. You know that. 

                                  HAMID
                    Knowing what he s done to you -- 
                    I m already dead. Just do it.  

      LIVING ROOM

      The door BREAKS open. Jamal stands there. Hamid lowers his 
      gaze and walks into the kitchen. Jamal, ignoring him, walks 
      straight to Fatma, standing in the doorway that leads to the 
      bedroom. He looks at her. His eyes red from crying.  

      Jamal grabs her. Kisses her. He s CRYING. He pushes her into 
      the bedroom and onto the bed. He gets on her. Spreads her 
      legs. Her hand makes its way under the pillow when suddenly, 
      unable to stop crying, Jamal pulls off --

                                  JAMAL
                    No! Not here!

      He gets up and wipes his eyes. On his way out --

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                          (to the goons)
                    Bring her! 

      Jamal exits. The goons grab her and exit. Once they re gone, 
      Hamid runs to the bed, he lifts the pillow and sees: nothing. 
      He runs to the window and sees the Ferrari zoom away. 


      EXT. ASIMA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

      The taxi stops in front of the airport. Barry is the first 
      one out, he opens the backseat door. While Molly, Sammy and 
      Emma get out, Barry unloads luggage from the trunk.                                                                   11-27-12     60.


      INT. ASIMA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

      Barry makes his way straight to the ticketing booth. A few 
      people stop and stare, recognizing the presidential family.

                                  BARRY
                    I need four plane tickets for 
                    tonight to Orlando. Coach.  

      The agent looks at Barry, knowing who he is.

                                  BARRY (CONT D)
                    Did you hear what I said? 

                                  AGENT
                          (snapping out of it)
                    Of course, Mr. Al-Fahed. Do you 
                    have a preferred airline?

                                  BARRY
                    No. I also don t care if it s 
                    direct or not. And if you can t 
                    find Orlando, then Miami or New 
                    York. Just get us out of here. 

      She nods and checks her computer. Barry turns to his family.

                                  BARRY (CONT D)
                      Passports. Now! 

      They silently give him the passports, he hands it to her. 

                                  AGENT
                    I have something to New York -- 

                                  BARRY
                    -- perfect.  
                          (to the family)
                    We re going home.

      She nods and works on the tickets. Barry looks at Molly. He s 
      out of breath. Starting to relax. It s all going to be fine. 


      EXT. COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT

      The road is dark and curvy on the rocky sea cliffs. Jamal 
      drives badly while drinking from a bottle of whiskey. 

      Fatma is by his side, afraid. She holds on to the side of the 
      car, as he takes another turn way, way too fast. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Why are you looking at me?                                                                   11-27-12     61.


                                  FATMA
                    I wasn t looking! I m sorry! 

      He slaps her and then wipes tears from his face. 

                                  JAMAL
                      Everyone s always looking at me.

      Fatma slowly pulls the syringe from her night gown. She holds 
      it, like a knife in her right palm.  

      Jamal unbuckles his belt. Fatma watches him. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    If you re good --

      He pulls his pants down. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    -- once I m president, you can do 
                    this every day.

      He takes his eyes off the road for a second and crosses to 
      the opposite lane. A turn is coming, the side of the cliff 
      hiding on-coming traffic. 

      He takes the turn, in the wrong lane.  And - 

      FUCK! A truck is RIGHT THERE. HUGE. Heading straight for 
      them. LOUD HONK. Fatma yells. Both vehicles hit the breaks. 

      The car misses the truck by a hair but flies off the road to 
      the shoulder, dangerously close to the edge of the cliff. 
      Jamal turns the wheel, hits the brakes... they glide forward, 
      spinning... Fatma s thrust to the left, then to the right. 

      Her hand bumps on the side of the car and ... 

      The syringe flies from her hand. Swiftly making its way to 
      the roaring waters below. The car settles in a cloud of dust. 


      INT. ASIMA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, GATE - NIGHT

      Barry sits on a bench. His leg jumping up and down, anxious. 
      The plane tickets in his hands. He checks his watch. He can t 
      wait to get out of there. 

      Molly, Sammy and Emma sit across from him: ALL A BIT SCARED.

                                  PAGE
                    Good evening, passengers. In a few 
                    minutes we will start pre-boarding 
                    flight 065 --                                                                   11-27-12     62.


      Barry is already on his feet, grabbing his carry-on. He looks 
      at his family, still seated. Without a word, they get up. 


      EXT. COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT

      LAUGHTER. A SICK TWISTED LAUGH. Jamal looks at Fatma. He 
      suddenly SCREAMS. Adrenalin washing over his body. 

                                  JAMAL
                    What?! 

      He grabs her face. She looks at him, defiant. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    STOP FUCKING LOOKING AT ME!  

      With one hand, he pulls down his underwear, and with the 
      other he grabs her by the back of the head and shoves her 
      face into his crotch. He looks down, moves her head a few 
      times: she gags and then settles her mouth onto him. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    Yeah. That s it.

      He rolls the car back on to the street and away. 


      INT. PLANE - NIGHT

      Molly, Sammy, Emma and Barry are cramped in the four middle 
      seats at the back of the plane as the RECORDING plays. 

                                  RECORDING (O.S.)
                    In the unlikely event of a water 
                    landing, your seat cushion can be 
                    used as a flotation device. 

      The family s TENSE, but Barry is staying positive. He just 
      wants to get the fuck out of the country. NOW.


      EXT. COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT

      The car is rocketing down the narrow road. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Yeah. Yeah. Don t stop! Don t you 
                    fucking stop, you little bitch! 

      AND THEN HE SCREAMS IN PAIN -- AND LOOKS DOWN --

      JAMAL S POV                                                                  11-27-12     63.


      As Fatma looks up at him, her face covered in BLOOD, and we 
      hear her spit what must be his cock on the floor of the car.

      ON THE NARROW ROAD

      The car spins out of control, doing full 360 s down the road. 


      INT. PLANE - DAY

      The plane pulls away from the gate. 

                                  RECORDING (V.O.)
                    Once we reach an altitude of ten 
                    thousand feet, you ll be able to 
                    use approved electronic devices.

      Barry looks out the window at the airport getting farther and 
      farther away. He looks at his family and smiles. They re out.  


      EXT. COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT

      The car is spinning out of control. Jamal YELLS. Fatma leans 
      back, and wipes the blood from her mouth with her hand. 

      The car spins to the shoulder, breaks the barrier and flies 
      off the cliff straight into mid air.... And drops to...  

      CRASH! -- it lands on its roof on the rocks below. STILLNESS. 


      EXT. ON THE ROCKS - CONTINUOUS

      PANNING SLOWLY, FIND Jamal hanging upside down in the car, 
      his head bloodied. Fatma s lifeless body hangs behind him. 

      CLOSER: he opens his eyes. His hands clutch at his crotch.  
      HE S ALIVE. He looks over at Fatma --

      JAMAL S POV

      Her open mouth is wet with blood. And there, near her head, 
      on the roof of the car, is laying -- HIS SEVERED PENIS. 

      OFF JAMAL: as he lets loose A STRANGLED SHRIEK OF PAIN.


      INT. PLANE - NIGHT

      Barry s eyes are closed as the plane suddenly slows. Barry 
      opens his eyes and fumblingly puts his glasses on. The 
      CAPTAIN S VOICE is heard coming over the loudspeaker.                                                                   11-27-12     64.


                                    CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                    Hello, this is the Captain 
                    speaking. We apologize for the 
                    delay, but the tower has asked us 
                    to wait here for a few minutes.
                          (after a beat)
                    Please remain in your seats.  

      Barry looks left. Something catches his eye. He gets up.  

                                  MOLLY
                    Barry...? Honey... 

      He crosses the aisle and leans over TWO SEATS WITH PASSENGERS 
      IN THEM to look out the window. His heart is pounding.

                                  BARRY
                    Shit.

      BARRY S POV

      A convoy heads towards the plane: a few limos and police cars 
      with their lights glaring. 


      INT. PLANE - NIGHT

      BARRY, looking with DREAD out the window, his face lit by the 
      lights from the police cars, as Molly and the kids push in 
      around and under him, all looking out the window.

                                  MOLLY
                    What is it?

                                  SAMMY
                    What s happening?

                                  EMMA
                    What s happening, Daddy?

                                  BARRY
                    I don t know.

                                  MOLLY
                          (looking out)
                      Ramzi...Leila...

      Sammy and Emma exchange a look. He s psyched they might be 
      staying; she s horrified at the prospect. She looks outside.

      THE FAMILY S POV OUT THE WINDOW

      The convoy has stopped. The sirens are wailing, their red and 
      blue lights filling the tarmac with ghostly light.                                                                  11-27-12     65.


      RAMZI AND LEILA get out of the lead car. Leila hangs back on 
      the tarmac but Ramzi and some GUARDS head for the plane as 
      the STAIRCASE is being rolled up by FLIGHT WORKERS.

      IN THE PLANE, MOMENTS LATER

      Ramzi and A GUARD walk onto the plane. Barry walks past Molly 
      to meet them in the aisle. 

                                  BARRY
                    What are you doing here?  

                                  RAMZI
                    Your brother s been in an accident. 
                    It would be best if you stayed.  

      Again, the siblings exchange looks behind Barry, who, feeling 
      the vise tightening around him, gets resolute.

                                  BARRY
                    No. We can t. We have to get home.

                                  RAMZI
                    At least stay until we ve buried 
                    your father, and your brother is 
                    out of the hospital --  

                                  BARRY
                    I can t. 
                          (quiet vehemence)
                    I can t stay here, Ramzi. And you know 
                    why. You were THERE.

      PUSHING IN ON BARRY: DOOMED -- 


      EXT. MA'AN STREET - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]

      We re back in the same moment from the last flashback. The 
      noise is almost unbearable... SCREAMS. FIRE everywhere. Women 
      and children running from the carnage. The men are lined up 
      against a wall, right across from Hassan s Mercedes. 

      A boy runs hysterically towards the car. GUNSHOT. His blood 
      squirts on the window.  

      Hassan walks into frame, PISTOL IN HAND. He stands between 
      the car and the frightened men. He raises his hand towards 
      Jamal. His fingers curl backwards. Bassam looks at Jamal. 

      The door opens and Jamal steps outside. Bassam waits in the 
      car, obedient, scared. He watches as Hassan stoops down and 
      talks to Jamal. Fire all around. GUNSHOTS. Screams of agony.                                                                   11-27-12     66.


                                  HASSAN
                          (yelling over the din)
                    The assassination was planned in 
                    this town. By these people. 
                      Understand...? 

      Jamal nods. Bassam watches.

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    The hardest thing about being a 
                    leader is that sometimes you have to 
                    do difficult things to your own 
                    people to save them from themselves. 

      Hassan beckons with one hand and a SOLDIER drags one of the 
      men from the wall over to Hassan and Jamal and pushes him 
      down to his knees in front of them. Bassam watches all this.

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                          (to Jamal)
                    It s like cancer. Sometimes you 
                    have to cut off a limb in order to 
                    save the body. 

                                  MAN
                    Please... It s not us. Please. 

      Hassan hands the gun to Jamal.  

                                  HASSAN
                    You do it.   

      Jamal takes the gun from his father. He takes a step forward. 
      Bassam, through his crooked glasses, watches from the car.   

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    Aim. 

      Jamal raises the gun at the MAN, who s now crying.

                                  MAN
                    Please. I have a family. I have a 
                    son. Like you. Please, don t! 

                                  HASSAN
                    Shoot him.  

      Bassam looks at Jamal and sees: a puddle of piss is forming 
      around his right shoe. Jamal takes a deep breath. His hand 
      shakes. 

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    Do it. For your country. For your 
                    people. For your father.                                                                   11-27-12     67.


      Jamal shakes. His small finger on the trigger. Then -- 

      The gun falls to the ground. Jamal, in tears, turns and runs 
      back to the car, crawls in past Bassam and hides, CRYING.

      Hassan cusses in Arabic and walks around to the other side of 
      the car and opens the door. Ramzi gets out and rushes to the 
      other side of the car to manage the mayhem while Hassan 
      struggles with Jamal in the backseat.

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    Get out there!

                                  JAMAL
                    No!

                                  HASSAN
                    Yes, get out and do as you re told!

      Bassam huddles on his side of the backseat as Hassan 
      struggles with Jamal, who s kicking and screaming --

                                  JAMAL
                    NO! NO! LEAVE ME ALONE!

      Bassam turns and looks where the SOLDIER is still holding the 
      MAN on his knees there in the middle of the chaos.

      IN THE BACKSEAT

      Hassan and Jamal are struggling as they hear FIVE GUNSHOTS --

      BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

      -- and they stop fighting and look up to see --

      HASSAN S POV

      Bassam, holding the smoking gun in two hands, his whole body 
      trembling and the MAN lays dead at his feet, his face blown 
      apart by bullets. 

      Ramzi stands nearby, observing with an almost clinical 
      interest what young Bassam has done. Watching as he turns 
      toward his father, looking at Hassan for approval -- which he 
      finally gets. 

                                  RAMZI (O.S.) (PRELAP)
                    Bassam... 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:                                                                  11-27-12     68.


      INT. PLANE - NIGHT

      ON RAMZI AND BARRY, IN A CLOSE TWO

                                  RAMZI
                    ...in that moment your father knew 
                    he d made a mistake. That you were 
                    the one he should have chosen. He 
                    also knew why you ran away. What 
                    you were afraid of... within 
                    yourself.

      ON BARRY: shivering almost imperceptibly from the memory.

                                  RAMZI (CONT D)
                    But all the years you stayed away -- 
                    they broke his heart. Now your 
                    family needs you. Stay.
                          (off Barry s hesitation)
                    You re not evil, Bassam. You simply 
                    have the wisdom to know what needs 
                    to be done, and the strength to do 
                    it. Don t run away again. Stay.

      BEAT. Barry looks out the window, onto the tarmac, where he 
      sees Leila standing. He looks back to Ramzi. He can t say no. 
      We see the doom settle on him: the destiny he s so scared of.

                                  RAMZI (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

      Barry turns and walks back to Molly. Sweat beads on his 
      forehead. Terror in his heart. And: A NEW HARDNESS.

                                  BARRY
                    I told you we shouldn t have come.

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.
