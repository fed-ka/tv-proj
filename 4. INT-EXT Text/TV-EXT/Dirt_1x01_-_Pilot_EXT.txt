  A HUMMER pulls up.  Tyreese s ride.


  LUCY SPILLER is looking into the mirror in her office, 
  changing her clothes while talking on the phone.  Behind her 
  are blown-up tabloid covers, documenting the rise and 
  (mostly) fall of the rich and infamous.

  Lucy is Executive Editor of NOW Magazine (like PEOPLE), THE 
  BOMB (like an even trashier ENQUIRER), and has a decent-sized 
  media empire at her fingertips. She s good-looking, late 30s-
  early 40s, and has maximized her assets.  She is in the 
  process of putting on a Dries Van Noten suit, a fair amount 
  of her Pilates-ripped body showing.  She moves with the 
    voracious, muscled efficiency of a tiger shark.

  She smiles, looks like they got this guy.

                              LUCY
                Okay.  Call me if anything changes.

                                                                        CUT TO:

  DON KONKEY S POV 

  Back in his  grave.   We see Prince Tyreese and the Hottie 
  cavorting into frame.  Devouring each other.  

  They stumble into the hot tub, and in a flash she is topless 
  and riding the all-time high scorer...

  Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce...

  She reaches the top of her bounce and we --

  FREEZE FRAME

  On the hot model/hooker, perched in ecstasis, one arm in the 
  air like a bronc rider, her full lips wet and parted, caught 
  for eternity at the height of sexual bliss.

  DON S POV

  Tyreese and the Hooker, from the dirt and leaves.  We hear 
  his labored, rhythmic breathing, hear the whisper-quiet 
  shutter of the camera as--                                                                                  3.



  MUSIC COMES UP

  The Out Crowd s  Son Of A Bitch (Plastic Ear Infection Mix) 

  And now we see the scene before us --

  UN-FREEZE

  And FREEZE again, over and over, as he captures the scene 
  before him; the rapturous, whimpering Hottie, the grim and 
    determined Tyreese, unaware his fate is about to change 
  forever.

  A SERIES OF STILLS

  These include: 

  --Tyreese spanks her.

  --She spanks him.

  --He  chokes  her.

  --She fastens on a strap-on, grins wickedly...

                                                                        CUT TO:


  A crowd gathered around the red carpet.  A caste system of 
  (from lowest to highest) fans, paparazzi,  legit  press, and 
  the be-jewelled actors and above-the-liners walking the 
  carpet.

  Working the press area with deep intensity is Lucy Spiller. 
  We MOVE with her as she tells photographers and videographers 
  what to get/do/look for...

                              LUCY
                      (to a videographer)
                Just get anything unflattering.  
                  Back-fat, asses, saddlebags, bra 
                straps, bellies...

  She moves to a photographer.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                Full body fashion shots only, 
                Damon.

  She moves to an ON-CAMERA TABLOID REPORTER.                                                                                  4.



                              LUCY (CONT D)
                Ask Carlo about the thing with the 
                  nanny...see if you can catch him 
                off guard, he ll be expecting 
                  softballs.

  She sees Don off to the side, trying to eat some chili-cheese 
  fries while standing up.  Loaded down with all his gear.  
  Still filthy from his earlier assignment, still with the MILF 
  HUNTER t-shirt, but now with a deeply rumpled old sport coat 
  over it.  Lucy looks annoyed.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                Don.

                              DON
                Hey, Lucy.  Want some chili-fries?

                              LUCY
                God, no.  
                      (sotto)
                Did you get Prince Tyreese?

                              DON
                      (regular voice)
                Yes. 

                              LUCY
                      (sotto)
                You got everything?

                              DON
                      (regular voice)
                I got them having sex for two 
                hours.  And the coke.  And he 
                choked her.  And the strap-on.

  Lucy puts up her hands to silence him.

                              LUCY
                  Don...not so loud.

                              DON
                 Kay.  

                              LUCY
                And remember, this one s between 
                you and me.  I don t want Alex to 
                see this footage until I figure out 
                how to break it.

                              DON
                 Kay.

  Don stares at her legs.  He puts a handful of chili fries in 
  his mouth.  Like he s watching a movie.                                                                                  5.



                              LUCY 
                Don?

                              DON
                Yeah.

                              LUCY
                Get candids of Holt and Julia, all 
                right?

                              DON
                 Kay.


  Ground Zero for unassigned paparazzi.  Don stands off to the 
  side of the other paparazzi, who schmooze and jockey for 
  position, photographing B-Listers who actually want to be 
    photographed. 

  Lucy leaves her car with the valet and starts to go in.

                              DON
                Hey, Lucy.

  She smiles perfunctorily and nods.  Pam Anderson gets out of 
  a car at the valet and the paparazzi swarm her.

  Don ignores the activity on the ground.  He s staring instead 
  at the SKY:

  DON S POV

  SFX: A mass of clouds swirling into a black vortex...SOUND of 
  STATIC, of HORSES GALLOPING.,.

  Don gapes at the sky, wind whips his hair.  A few raindrops 
  of blood fall on his face.  He wipes his face and looks at 
  the blood.

  AT THE OUTDOOR TABLES

  Lucy sits with her brother, LEO.  He s in his 30s, bi, 
  working the whole urban neo-Mr. Clean look; worked bod, 
  shaved head, earrings in both ears, neck tat.

                              LEO
                I don t understand...you blacked 
                out and woke up with some stallion 
                in your bed?

                              LUCY
                Yeah.  Naked.  Both of us.

                              LEO
                I gotta start tagging along.

                              LUCY
                Don t be an asshole, Leo.  
                  I...screwed this guy or something, 
                and I don t remember. 

                              LEO
                How many drinks did you have?                                                                                20.



                              LUCY
                You know me...drinking and bars 
                don t really mix.  I had one 
                martini.  

                              LEO
                You don t remember anything?

                              LUCY
                I guess I remember him sitting next 
                to me...then nothing.  Is there 
                such a thing as blackout sex?

                              LEO
                Nothing?

                              LUCY
                Nothing.  Until I woke up.

                              LEO
                Sis.  You got roofied.

                              LUCY
                What?

                              LEO
                Rocker boy roofied you.

  It dawns on Lucy...of course.

                              LUCY
                Son of a bitch.  Sonofabitch!

  OFF LUCY, we TRACK a few tables down, where Holt sits with 
  his manager, CHERYL STEEN, short and cute with a huge rack 
  and an even bigger crush on Holt.

                                CHERYL
                  Baby...baby...I m so sorry.

                              HOLT
                  I mean...what the--

                                CHERYL 
                I know sweetie...they suck.  
                They re idiots.  If you could get a 
                little press, or even like, do Will 
                & Grace or something... 

                              HOLT
                I m not doing fuckin  Will & Grace. 
                What did Sydney Pollack say 
                exactly?                                                                                21.



                                CHERYL
                  I couldn t get him on the phone.  
                JJ went on this whole rant about 
                how you re not  bankable  or  hot  
                or whatever--

                              HOLT
                Awright, awright...I get it.  

  Holt stares into his grilled vegetable salad.  Looks up to 
  see LUCY staring at him.  She smiles and waves.  He waves 
  back.

  ON LUCY AND LEO

                              LUCY
                Oh Christ, here she comes.

                              LEO
                Look at her, like she could eat us 
                both.

  An older woman, DOROTHY SPILLER, wild-eyed but very put-
  together, heads toward them, pissed off, a Belizean NURSE on 
  her arm.

                              LUCY
                Hi, mom.

                              DOROTHY
                Batida tried to poison me this 
                morning.

  Batida, the nurse, rolls her eyes.  These two loathe each 
  other.

                              LEO
                And yet, here you stand.

                              DOROTHY
                Tried to give me a mango.  
                      (to Batida, furious)
                What s wrong with you?

                                BATIDA
                What s wrong is you re still alive.

                              LUCY
                I m sure she didn t know about your 
                allergy.

                              DOROTHY
                My tongue puffs up like a blowfish.                                                                                 22.



                              LUCY
                Well, looks like you made it.  Do 
                you want your Cobb Salad?

                              DOROTHY
                Yes, I want my Cobb Salad...my mind 
                is like an old sponge and even I 
                know I always have the Cobb Salad.

  Leo nods to a waiter...the Cobb Salad.

                              DOROTHY (CONT D)
                Did you read Maureen Dowd this 
                morning in the Times?  Made a real 
                case for Syria.

  Leo glances at Lucy...here we go.

                              DOROTHY (CONT D)
                Now there s a journalist.  

  Lucy grits her teeth.

                              LUCY
                Yeah, she s great.

                              DOROTHY
                She didn t squander her journalism 
                degree.

                              LUCY
                      (for the millionth time)
                Not like some people.

                              DOROTHY
                Well, as long as you re 
                  happy...maybe if you had a 
                  family...

                              LUCY
                Then I could pass this glorious 
                  mother/daughter legacy on to her.

                              DOROTHY
                  Well...more likely you than Mr. 
                Clean here...out homo-ing every 
                night...

                              LEO
                I m bi, mom--

                              DOROTHY
                Ahh!!  Don t say it!  God!  

                              LUCY
                Hey, Dorothy.  That s your son.                                                                                23.



                              DOROTHY
                  Bi...what is that?  Faggotry for 
                cowards.

                              LUCY 
                Hey mom, let s get back on what a 
                  disappointment I am...I feel that 
                one s really got legs.

  Leo looks at her with gratitude, but still says:

                              LEO
                I can take care of myself, Lu.

                              LUCY
                      (smiling)
                  Actually, no, you can t.

  They share a moment of conspiracy in the misery of their 
  mother.

  The Cobb Salad is deposited in front of Dorothy.

                              DOROTHY 
                What s this?  Where s my breakfast?

  OVER THE IVY

  The giant mass of clouds swirls.  Don stares up at it while 
  the world moves around him.


  KAI, the hair farmer who roofied Lucy, walks into the Tomkat.  
  The marquis proclaims,  NOW PLAYING, SCHINDLER S FIST 

  CLICK CLICK CLICK

  Pick up Don taking photos from his pap ride.

  Don gets out and enters the theatre.


  Hot valet parking girls sprint for cars.  Beemers, rice 
  rockets, vintage muscle cars, all manner of tight rides pull 
  up.  Beefy security guys chase away paparazzi.  


  Holt pulls up outside the Ivy, where Don sits in his blacked-
  out paparazzi-mobile with his camera rig.  Holt s window 
  opens just a crack.

                              HOLT
                Follow me.                                                                                36.



                              DON
                 Kay.

  Don pulls into traffic to follow Holt.  Holt s car leaves a 
  luminous rainbow trail behind it.


  The two cars are pulled up alongside one another, like 
  they re making a drug deal.  Holt looks pained and hung over.  
  Don is looking a little panicky, trying to stay focused.

                              HOLT
                ...and no matter what, my name can 
                never be used.

                              DON
                Your name means nothing.  

                              HOLT
                Thanks.

                              DON
                They wouldn t want to use your name 
                for something like this.  

                              HOLT 
                Well, they can t.  No matter what.

                              DON
                 Kay.

                              HOLT
                      (from some deep, terrible 
                        place)
                                (MORE)                                                                                37.

                              HOLT (CONT'D)
                And I want some cash and I 
                  want...some kind of good press.  I 
                want stories in your magazines.  I 
                want stories...that make it seem 
                like I m getting offers...

                              DON
                I need to have some idea how big a 
                story you have...

                              HOLT
                Big.

                              DON
                Whether we get it exclusively...  

                              HOLT
                You do.

                              DON
                And I have to talk to Lucy.  For 
                all I know we already know all 
                about it.

                              HOLT 
                You don t.  Nobody does.  

                              DON
                They ll want more than just the one 
                story.

                              HOLT
                      (cold)
                I ve got as much as they can 
                handle.

  Holt starts to raise his window.  Don appears to want to hang 
  out.

                              DON 
                How s your big project?

  Holt just keeps the window going until Don is staring at 
  blacked-out glass.  

                              DON (CONT D)
                I ll call you.

  Holt speeds off.


  Don is pressed up against the side of the building, breathing 
  deeply, sweating.


  Don climbs out of his rig; today it s a black Mercedes SUV 
  with dealer plates.                                                                                  42.


  He appears to be somewhat back on his game, handling his 
  equipment deftly.  He shoulders his Canon and carries a 
  Starbucks cup.  He walks toward an estate wall.

  Don leans against the estate wall and sips his coffee.  A 
  look of consternation crosses his face.

  IN THE SHRUBS

  Don pulls down his trousers and squats.

  DON S FACE

  As he squeezes one out.

  OFFSCREEN

  The sound of an IDLING VEHICLE.  Don holds his breath.

  DON S POV

  Through the shrubs, a beat-up  58 Chevy pickup.  

  The driver is not visible.  Just a hand on the steering 
    wheel...well, a large paw.  

  The Sad Cat Man GUNS the old pickup and it drives off with 
  its signature throaty purr.

  DON

  Pulls up his pants and walks over to the estate wall.  Climbs 
  it.

  He hops down and begins scaling a eucalyptus tree with a view 
  of the house below.

  IN THE TREE

  Don, perched like a schizophrenic Koala bear, struggles to 
  get a shot lined up.

  IN THE HOUSE

  We ve been here before.  It s Kira Klay s house.  She paces 
  in and out of frame, back and forth, eyes puffy, in her 
  sweats.   

  Suddenly, into frame walks JEFF STAGLIANO, an indie film 
    actor/director a la Vince Gallo.  Grungy.

                              JEFF STAGLIANO
                I think babies are beautiful.

                              KIRA
                Shut up.                                                                                43.



                              JEFF STAGLIANO
                I m cool with just bein  the baby 
                daddy.

                              KIRA
                I m not.  I slept with you once.

                              JEFF STAGLIANO
                So?  I sleep with a lot of people 
                once.

                              KIRA
                That s my point, Jeff.

                              JEFF STAGLIANO
                Okay, so just say someone else is 
                the baby daddy.

                              KIRA
                Please don t say it like that.

                              JEFF STAGLIANO
                Like what?

                              KIRA
                Like you re P Diddy or something.  
                God!  I cannot believe I ever threw 
                you a bang.  And I am trying to 
                tell you that The Bomb already 
                knows you re the father because 
                that whore Julia Myers told them.

  Jeff comes up behind her and rests both hands on her belly.

                              JEFF STAGLIANO
                Well, whatever s going on, you 
                should take it easy and not get so 
                tweaked.

  She closes her eyes for a second, enjoying the touch.

  IN THE HOUSE

  Kira begins to emerge from her reverie.                                                                                44.



                              KIRA
                You need to take your hands off me 
                now, Jeff.

  magazine, complete with all the tabloid graphics...

   SHE S HAVING HIS BABY!! 


  Julia and Holt look through the news stand.  Julia spots the 
  magazine.

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                Here it is!

  She pulls out the magazine.  Holt looks at it with her.  We 
  catch a look at it; Holt and Julia at a premiere, Holt 
  tutoring an inner-city youth, the usual drivel.

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                Baby, it s awesome!  I can t 
                believe they just did a nice little 
                piece on you. 
                        (insinuating)
                Maybe they know something I don t.                                                                                45.



  Holt s eyes flash.

                              HOLT
                What would they know?

                              JULIA
                Maybe they know a certain sexy 
                young leading man is about to get a 
                big movie or something...

                              HOLT
                Yeah, stranger things have 
                  happened.

                              JULIA
                Hey, look at this!
                    (reading)
                 Wagging tongues in the rumor-mill 
                say that Holt has several big movie 
                deals in the works. 

                              HOLT
                Wish they d let me know about them.

                              JULIA
                Doesn t matter.  If they think 
                you re hot, you ll be hot.

                              HOLT
                If you say so.

                              JULIA 
                Babe...I am so proud of you.

  She puts her arms around him.  She squeezes him innocently.  
  She starts to let go and he holds her tighter.

  He looks out at the sea of magazines plastered with famous 
  faces and hangs on to Julia with everything he has.


  The group stumbles out of the club.  

  Julia s cell phone rings.

                              JULIA
                  Hello...what?  What...slow down.  
                  Okay....okay, thanks.

  She looks at Holt.

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                It s Kira.  She OD d.

  Holt stands there, Sunset swirling around him.


                              END OF ACT THREE                                                                                53.


                                    ACT FOUR


  Holt speeds through Hollywood in his old Carera.


  Don walks toward camera.  We see--but Don doesn t--Holt 
  charging into frame...

  HOLT SMASHES DON

    A roundhouse sucker punch to the ear.  Don goes down hard 
  onto the concrete.  We pick up the RINGING and IMPAIRED 
  HEARING of Holt s punch on DON S POV...

                              DON
                Oh--

                              HOLT
                You piece a shit!  Scumbag!

  Holt kicks him.

  DON S POV

  Looking up at Holt.  The sun backlighting Holt, causing an 
  angelic silhouette.

                              DON
                It s okay...

  Several FIGURES now;  Holt, the Sad Cat Man, and other 
  strangely powerful ANIMISTIC TOTEMIC FIGURES (think 
    Miyazaki).  They stand around in a circle, as if in some 
  bizarre druidic meeting.  SOUND of HORSES GALLOPING.

  The Figures talk in a strange, almost-identifiable language, 
  ancient and low.  They seem to be conferring over Don s very 
  soul.

                              DON (CONT D)
                It s okay, buddy.  It s okay, 
                Tristan.  That s my buddy.

  Holt kicks him again.                                                                                59.



                              HOLT
                Fucking nutball.

  Holt stands over Don, ready to kick him again, then sees that 
  he s completely out of it.  A brief moment of regret, then he 
  turns and walks away.

  The Totem Figures begin to gather in an ever-tightening 
  circle around Don, laying their hands on him.  From one of 
  the figures, GIANT WINGS EMERGE.

  END DON POV 

  Just Holt now, walking across the parking lot, leaving Don 
  curled up on the ground.


  Don approaches his apartment.  His face is bruised and he 
  limps.  Don opens his door.                                                                                61.




  CLOSE ON--

  A HAIRY PAW/HAND KNOCKING.
