      EXT. AIRPORT.  DAY 1  08.0111

      A busy airport. Huge passenger jets land and take off with 
      shattering blasts from their powerful engines. The airport 
    is bursting with life and energy, a familiar yet powerful 
      vision of the noisy, far-reaching triumph of modern 
      technology.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL. DAY 1  08.0422

      Passengers pour in all directions as the departure boards 
      indicate destinations in virtually every country in the 
      world. The terminal is heaving with people, shopping, 
      eating, laughing, talking, coughing, sneezing, kissing, 
      embracing, touching. We linger on their faces for a second 
      until the sheer number of them becomes a blur; we have an 
      overwhelming sense of the closenessof modern life. 
      Everyone is intimately connected.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL. PASSPORT CONTROL. DAY 1  08.2533

      DAVID and ABBY GRANT hurry towards the passport desks. The 
      queue ahead is slow, with only one weary IMMIGRATION 
      OFFICIAL handling the busy flow of people. DAVID and ABBY 
    are in their early 30s, pleasant looking and attractive. 
      ABBY fumbles in her bag, holding up the queue behind her. 

                                  ABBY
                    David! I ve lost my passport...

    He looks at her in exasperation. She roots through the 
      contents of her bag.

                                  ABBY
                    I can t find it... Oh, God. I 
                    left it on the plane. I can see 
                    it on the seat...

                                  DAVID
                    You alwaysdo this. (Pause) Have 
                    you checked your pockets?

                                  ABBY
                    Of course I ve checked my...

    She stops in relief as she finds her passport inside her 
      jacket. He rolls his eyes and she digs him affectionately 
    in the back as they shuffle forward.

                                  ABBY
                    I do not alwaysdo that.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      They finally make it to the front and show their passports 
    to the OFFICIAL. She glances routinely at their photos, 
      blinking and rubbing her eyes, momentarily disoriented. 
      ABBY notices she is sweating.

                                  ABBY
                    You re busy today.

                                    IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL
                    We ve got a lot of staff off with 
                    this flu bug. Sorry for any 
                    delay. 

                                  ABBY
                    It s not your fault.

    She gives them their passports back. DAVID and ABBY move 
      towards the baggage area. 

                                  DAVID
                    Of course it s their bloody 
                    fault. They don t employ enough 
                    people.

                                  ABBY
                    They can t help being ill, can 
                    they?

      ABBY s mobile rings. She listens eagerly as they walk.

                                  ABBY
                    It s a message from Peter...

    Her expression grows anxious as she listens.

                                  ABBY
                    They went white water rafting 
                    this morning... his canoe 
                    capsized and he had to be 
                      rescued....

    She quickly presses a number.

                                  DAVID
                    What are you doing?

                                  ABBY
                    Calling him...

                    What if he s cut himself on a 
                    rock? It could get infected.

      There is a hint of panic in her response. 

                                  DAVID
                    Abby, you promised you wouldn t 
                    make a fuss.

    She hesitates and looks at him uncertainly.

                                  DAVID
                    We ll call him this evening, like 
                    we said.

    She gives in reluctantly. DAVID puts an arm around her 
      shoulders as they head towards the exit. HOLD on them as 
      they walk out of the terminal past the thousands of other 
      travellers, then -

      There is a faintly neglected back garden with a covered 
      trampoline in one corner and a football left amongst the

      DAVID opens a can of lager and slides it across the table 
    to JOE POPE while ABBY pours crisps into a bowl and chats 
    to Joe s wife LINDA. Joe and Linda, the next door 
      neighbours, are an amiable couple in their late 30s.A TV 
      plays silently in the corner. 

                                  LINDA
                    Tell us about Cyprus, then. Was 
                    it dead romantic?

                                  DAVID
                    Oh, sexy as hell. Abby spent the 
                    whole time in the hotel texting
                    Peter.

                                  ABBY
                    I was worried about him. It s 
                    only been a few months...

                                  LINDA
                    But he s fine now, isn t he? He 
                    looks so well.

      ABBY hesitates but DAVID steps in, smiling briskly.

                                  DAVID
                    He s in total remission. A 
                    hundred per cent well. He s a 
                    normal, healthy little boy. 

    He says this forcefully, as much for Abby s benefit, we 
      feel, as Joe and Linda s. ABBY glances at him.

                                  ABBY
                    We ll always have to be careful.

                                  DAVID
                    That doesn t mean we treat him 
                    like an invalid.

                    I m sick of talking about 
                    Leukemia.

      ABBY looks at him, resenting the unfairness of this. JOE 
    and LINDA look awkward at the sudden atmosphere. JOE smiles 
      affably. 

                                  JOE
                    Our Michael did that adventure 
                    holiday thing last year. He loved 
                    it. (Pause) Cheers!

      They clink cans and glasses. JOE glances at the TV, which 
      shows a long line of people queuing at a doctor s surgery 
      under the banner  Flu Crisis Worsens . 

                                  JOE
                          (Looking at the TV)
                    It s mad. A few weeks ago no one 
                    had even heard of European Flu. 
                    Now half the country s off sick.

                    closing the school for a few 
                    days. The kids are ecstatic.

      ABBY looks at DAVID uneasily.

                                  ABBY
                    I should have taken Peter for a 
                    jab before he went.

                                  DAVID
                    He ll be fine up where he is. 

                                  JOE
                    Miles away from anywhere. Best 
                    place to be.

    As he smiles Abby glances uncertainly at the silent images 
    of queues of people waiting for their flu jabs.

                                  DAVID
                    You have to let go of the fear 
                    now, Abby. Not just for my sake. 
                    For all of us. 

    She looks at him, close to tears. He takes her in his arms 
    and she finally lets him hold her, her mood softening.

                                  ABBY
                    I get so frightened. If something 
                    happened to him and I wasn t 
                    there...

                                  DAVID
                    Nothing s going to happen.

    He sounds so certain she laughs and brushes the tears from 
    her eyes.

                                  ABBY
                    You re right. He s fine.

                                  DAVID
                    So we re not going to get him?

                                  ABBY
                          (Shakes her head)
                    Let him have fun.

    He smiles. She thinks for a second.

                                  ABBY
                    And I m going to see Helen about 
                    getting my old job back.

                                  DAVID
                    Great idea.

                                  ABBY
                    It s time for a fresh start. 

    She smiles bravely. He kisses her and the kiss quickly 
      becomes passionate. There is a huge release of emotion in 
    the way they hold each other, months of anguish and fear 
      pent up in their sudden desperate affection. 

                                  ABBY
                    I love you.

    He smiles. She nudges him sharply.

                    It only counts when you re not 
                    expecting it. 

    He grins and grabs her hand to lead her upstairs. She 
      pauses to reach behind her for her mobile. He looks at her 
      wryly.

    He gazes at her. She sighs and puts the mobile back on the 
      table, then follows him out, grabbing his hand as they go. 
    We hear them laughing as they tumble up the stairs.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. DR. THOMPSON S OFFICE. DAY 1 14.411212

    TOM PRICE (30s) sits staring at the floor, his hands 
      clasped in front of him. He wears jeans and a blue shirt. 
    The room is bare except for a few shelves of books, a faded 
    art print on the wall, a desk and a computer. There are no 
      windows. Opposite PRICE sits DR. COLIN THOMPSON (40s). 

                                  PRICE
                    The first thing I remember is 
                    sitting in the kitchen while mum 
                    was ironing. She was laughing at 
                    something on the radio. I used to 
                    like it best when I was alone 
                    with her.

                                  THOMPSON
                    Did you resent it when your 
                    brother was born? 

                                  PRICE
                    Why would I? 

                                  THOMPSON
                    Because his arrival shattered 
                    that special bond you had with 
                    your mother.

      PRICE looks up, smiling.

                                  PRICE
                    I know where this is going. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  THOMPSON
                    You talk about your mother a lot.

                                  PRICE
                    She s a strong woman. I respect 
                    her. 

                                  THOMPSON
                    Do you love her?

                                  PRICE
                          (Grins)
                    Not in the way you mean.

      PRICE is lean and handsome, with a charming smile. There is 
      a focused strength about him that is both attractive and 
      unsettling. 

                                  THOMPSON
                    Has she been to see you recently?

                                  PRICE
                          (Shakes his head)
                    She doesn t approve of me 
                    anymore. 

                                  THOMPSON
                    Is that surprising? Most people 
                    would describe what you did as 
                    evil.

                                  PRICE
                    Most people don t interest me. 

    He smiles, fixing THOMPSON with his laconic gaze.

                                  THOMPSON
                    She said in the newspapers that 
                    you re no longer her son. How 
                    does that make you feel?

                                  PRICE
                    Angry. Very angry. It makes me 
                    want to pick up a hammer and 
                    smash someone s head in.

    He stares at THOMPSON, then bursts out laughing. 

                                  PRICE
                    I m sad about it. But what can I 
                    do? (Pause) Are you all right, 
                    doc?

      THOMPSON massages his temples as he listens.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    Just a headache. (Pause) Have you 
                    written to her..?

      A piercing alarm rings and the door opens. Prison Officer 
      GARY WILSON, paunchy and middle-aged, comes in. Only now do 
    we fully realisethat Thompson s office is inside a high 
      security prison. 

                                  WILSON
                    Back to your cell, Price. 

                                  PRICE
                    Not now, Mr. Wilson. We re just 
                    on the verge of a breakthrough.

      THOMPSON smiles tolerantly and glances at WILSON. 

                                  THOMPSON
                    What s going on?

                                  WILSON
                    Governor s orders. All prisoners 
                    to be isolated to prevent the 
                    spread of European flu.

      PRICE stands up, looking at WILSON with teasing concern. 

                                  PRICE
                    You re looking a bit peaky
                    yourself, Mr. Wilson.

      INT. PRISON. DAY 1  14.431313

      PRICE walks ahead of WILSON along the gangway. All along 
    the corridor PRISONERS are being locked in their cells amid 
      angry cries of protest. 

                                  PRICE
                    How long is this going to last?

                                  WILSON
                    As long as it takes. 

      PRICE looks back at him, deadpan.

                                  PRICE
                    You can t just lock us all up. 
                    It s a breach of our human

      INT. PRISON. PRICE S CELL. DAY 1  14.431414

      PRICE enters his cell, glancing briefly at TONY COYNE (19) 
    his cell mate, who sits on his bed, reading a dog-eared 
      graphic novel. COYNE is little more than a child - 
      gangling, eager to please and not too bright. 

                                  COYNE
                    All right, Tom? Weird stuff this,

                    Locked up all day with you? It s 
                    a bloody nightmare. Nelson 
                    Mandelahad it easy.

      COYNE giggles as WILSON locks the door. 

                                  COYNE
                    Most of the screws are off sick.

                    I had flu once. Sweats and shakes

                    You re an idiot, Coyne. 

      COYNE laughs. PRICE paces restlessly around the cell. 

                                  COYNE
                    You reckon they ll send us home,

                    You too.. Peter?

    But the line is already dead. ABBY puts her phone away, 
      feeling uneasy but angry with herself for fretting. 

                                                                        CUT TO: 


      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE. STAFF CAFE. DAY 2  15.431616

      ABBY and HELEN CRAWLEYchief women s clothes buyer, sit 
      down at a table with coffee and sandwiches.

                                  HELEN
                    I can t stay long. I ve got to 
                    get Frank to the doctors. 

                                  ABBY
                    Is it the bug?

                                  HELEN
                          (Laughs)
                    Of course it s worse for him than 
                    anyone else. You know what men 
                    are like. 

      They share a smile of complicity, but Helen frowns.

                                  HELEN
                    It s the old folks you worry 
                    about. It always hits them 
                    hardest.

      ABBY smiles vaguely but is already planning her next 
      speech. She takes a (mental) deep breath. 

                                  ABBY
                    Helen, I was wondering about me 
                    coming back to work. I know it s 
                    been a while...

    She pauses. Helen looks at her kindly. 

                                  HELEN
                    How is your Peter now?

                                  ABBY
                            (Determined)
                    Fine. He s absolutely fine.

                                  HELEN
                    We were all rooting for him.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    I know that.

      HELEN smiles encouragingly.

                                  HELEN
                    I never wanted you to go. Not 
                    many of my girls handled the 
                    salesmen so well. They all asked 
                    for you.

                                  ABBY
                    They were all trying to get into 
                    my knickers. You know what 
                    salesmen are like.

      HELEN laughs, but looks thoughtful.

                                  HELEN
                    You re sure you re ready to come 
                    back?

                                  ABBY
                      Absolutely.

                                  HELEN
                          (Smiles)
                    I ll put in a word... 

    She stops, her attention distracted by events outside the 
      window. ABBY follows her gaze. A middle-aged woman has 
      collapsed in the street. People crowd around her to help. 
      HELEN and ABBY watch.

                                  ABBY
                    Do you think she s all right?

                                  HELEN
                    It must be the flu.

      Outside, the woman is lifted to her feet. Someone gives her 
      back her handbag and she is helped away to a seat.

                                  HELEN
                    She needs to be home in bed, poor 
                    love.

                    I am sorry to announce that owing

    As the frustrated crowd jostles around her she scratches at 
      a persistent itch in her armpit, hardly even aware she s 
      doing it.  

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. BRIDEWELL PRIMARY SCHOOL. GATES/PLAYGROUND. DAY216.151818

    The school is a typical inner city mixture of single storey 
      pre-fabricated buildings. Standing in the playground is 
      JENNY WALSH, 24. She is very pretty, with a sweet, 
      sympathetic manner. At her side is TINA STYLES, 7, who 
      carries her rucksack on her back. 

                                  JENNY
                    Don t worry, Tina. She ll be here 
                    in a minute. 

                                  TINA
                    Mummy s ill.

                                  JENNY
                    A lot of people are ill.

                                  TINA
                    You re not.

                                  JENNY
                    Neither are you. We re lucky, 
                    aren t we?

      Suddenly JENNY sees a man running towards them. 

                                  TINA
                    Daddy!

                                  MR. STYLES
                    Sorry... I couldn t get a bus.

    He scoops his daughter up in his arms. She feels his face.

                                  TINA
                    You re hot!

                                  MR. STYLES
                    I ve been running, sweetheart.

      JENNY can see he is ill. He avoids her gaze.

                                  MR. STYLES
                    I ve got to get back. Her mum s 
                    in bed...

                                  JENNY
                    There s no school tomorrow. We 
                    think it s best if the children 
                    stay at home for a few days.

      TINA waves goodbye and JENNY waves back. MARION STURGES 
      (50) the Head Teacher, comes to stand at Jenny s side.

                                  MARION
                    Half the children off yesterday, 
                    two thirds today. It s very 
                    upsetting.

    She looks exhausted. JENNY looks at her with concern.

                                  JENNY
                    Are you all right Mrs. Sturges?

                                  MARION
                    Fine. I just haven t eaten all 
                    day.

      INT. TRAIN. DAY 2  17.302020

      ABBY is wedged into the carriage. The train grinds along 
      reluctantly, hot, airless and miserable. Passengers stand 
    in stupefied silence. The MAN next to her sneezes violently 
      while a WOMAN nearby looks hot and unwell. ABBY takes out 
    her mobile and tries Peter s number but only gets a 
      recorded message. 

                                  ABBY
                    Peter? It s mum. Call me.

    She gazes out of the window, longing to be home. Suddenly 
    the woman faints, falling back against the window. ABBY is 
      only inches away. She is shocked by how ill the woman 
      looks. A MAN stands up reluctantly to give her his seat.

                                  ABBY
                    Are you all right, love?

    The woman only looks at her vaguely. The passengers 
      exchange uneasy glances.

      INT. GRANT HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY 2 19.452121

      DAVID watches the TV as he lays the table. Images of jam 
      packed health centres and A&E departments fill the screen.

                          (Over)
                    The flu crisis deepened today 
                    with much of the UK s population 
                    now affected by the virulent 
                    strain. In a statement the Prime 
                    Minister said everything possible 
                    was being done to confront the 
                    emergency. Updated medical advice 
                    this evening is that anyone who 
                    fears they may have contracted 
                    the flu should stay at home, 
                    drink plenty of fluids and avoid 
                    contacting a health professional 
                    except in an emergency...

    He turns the sound down as he hears the front door slam and 
      ABBY comes in. She smiles in relief as she sees him.

                                  ABBY
                    Three hours for a twenty minute 
                    journey.

                    It s crazy. The whole country s 
                    grinding to a halt. 

    She kisses him quickly, preoccupied.

                                  ABBY
                    Have you heard from Peter? I 
                    spoke to him earlier and he was a 
                    bit strange.

                                  DAVID
                    Strange how?

                    He probably wanted to go out and 
                    play.

    She smiles, trying to convince herself he must be right.

    She grins. DAVID is thrilled.

                    That s great.

      Abby smiles but can t control her bubbling anxiety.

                    Look, don t be angry with me, but 
                    I think something was wrong with 
                    him. 

      DAVID looks at her patiently. She sighs and finally gives 
    in as cheerfully as she can.

                                  ABBY
                    Okay, I ll stop worrying now. I m

      GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS and CIVIL SERVANTS mill about setting 
    up laptopsand plasma screens and talking urgently into 
      mobiles. SAMANTHA WILLIS (late 30s/40s) walks through the 
      milling crowd of her staff with MARK CARTER, (20s) her 
      chief aide, at her elbow. They move towards her office, 
      which is semi-partitioned off from the rest of the office. 
      WILLIS, the junior Minister for Health, is attractive and 
      elegant.

                    The State of Emergency is still

                    The Prime Minister is reluctant 
                    to put troops on the streets. He 
                    feels that should be a last 
                    resort.

                                  WILLIS
                    What stage does he think we re at 
                    now?

    He shrugs helplessly. She smiles in exasperation.

                                  WILLIS
                    I have to give the media more 
                    information. 

                                  CARTER
                    We should stress the problems are 
                      unprecedented. There hasn t been 
                    an outbreak of this severity 
                    since 1918, that kind of thing. 

                                  WILLIS
                    Can I at least announce that the 
                    army is on stand-by? 

    She looks at CARTER but his expression makes her pause. 

                                  WILLIS
                    What is it, Mark?

    He takes a piece of paper from his inside pocket.

                      confidential. I m still trying to

    She glances at it, then looks up.

                                  WILLIS
                    The impact of the virus is 
                    thought to be more severe than 
                    early tests indicated. What does 
                    that mean?

                          (After a second)
                    No one seems to know. All they 
                    said was that the implications 
                    are very serious.

                                  WILLIS
                    How serious?

    He shrugs helplessly. END on the nervous uncertainty on his

      INT. GRANT HOUSE. BATHROOM. DAY 2.  20.052424

    It is a light summer s evening. ABBY lies soaking in a hot 
      bath, letting the warm water soothe her aching body. A 
      glass of red wine stands on the side. She reaches up for it 
    but her hand brushes the glass and sends it tumbling. It 
      smashes on the floor and a red stain leaks across the 
      tiles. ABBY attempts to get out of the bath but suddenly 
      feels woozy. She closes her eyes to clear her head as she 
      scratches at her armpit. Only now does she think to look 
    for the cause of the irritation. She raises her arm. There 
    is a small pink lump under her armpit. She stares at it in 
      surprise but is then distracted as she hears her mobile 
      ringing downstairs.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                                  DAVID
                    When was this? 

    His expression grows more serious as he listens.  

                                  DAVID
                    You should have phoned us 
                    straight away. You knew his 
                    medical history...

      ABBY comes in at the end of this in jeans and a T-shirt, 
    her hair still wet from the bath. She knows immediately 
      something is wrong.

                                  ABBY
                    David? What is it? 

    She tries to take the phone but he holds it away from her 
    as he finishes his conversation. 

                                  DAVID
                    We ll be there as soon as we can.

    He hangs up. ABBY looks at him frantically as he tries to 
      reassure her. 

                                  DAVID
                    It s nothing serious. He s just a 
                    little unwell.

                                  ABBY
                    Oh, God. I knew it. I knew 
                    something was wrong. We have to 
                    get him to the hospital, check 
                    his white blood cell count...

                                  DAVID
                    It s nothing to do with the 
                    cancer. It  s flu. He s got the 
                    flu and gone to bed, that s 
                    all...

                                  ABBY
                    How do they know? The symptoms 
                    aren t that different...

    Her panic turns rapidly to anger.

                                  ABBY
                    He shouldn t even be there. We 
                    should have brought him home.

    She wrenches the phone furiously from his hand. 

                                  ABBY
                    Why did I ever listen to you? Why 
                    was I so stupid?

    She spits the words out bitterly. DAVID looks at her, 
      feeling both angry and guilty.

                                  DAVID
                    Well, do you want to stand here 
                    arguing about it or do you want 
                    to get going?

    out to touch her face.

    and ABBY sit in the queue in tense silence. DAVID looks at 
    the cars in front.

      DAVID wedges his car in front of the next in line and jumps 
      out. The driver already waiting looks at him in outraged 
      protest. DAVID holds out his hands in apology.

    He lands a clumsy punch on DAVID, who pushes him away. 
      Other DRIVERS rush over to intervene.

                    He s a bloody queue jumper...

    The other drivers, exasperated by the long wait, also turn 
    on David. He lashes out angrily, still clinging to the 
      pump, and gets thumped for his trouble.

    The confrontation turns into a full on scrap, though with

      ABBY watches in horror. Then, from her POV, we see the 
      whole scene go briefly out of focus. She staggers, 
      clutching at her head, sweat pouring down her face. 

                                  ABBY
                    David? David!

    He looks across as she suddenly collapses against the car. 
      Horrified, he drags himself away from the fight and rushes 
      across to her. The other drivers stand and watch, not sure 
    how to respond. Abby is conscious but very woozy. 

                                  DAVID

                    We ll go home, get you a doctor. 
                    Then I ll come back for Peter...

      ABBY is too weak and groggy to argue. He picks her up and 
      puts her back as gently as he can in the car, then runs 
      around to the other side. The other drivers look on in 
      silence.

                    him. I ll catch it as well.

    The spy hole slides closed. PRICE controls his anger and 
      goes back to COYNE, who is clutching his armpit.

                                  COYNE
                    My arm really hurts.

    He looks like a frightened child. PRICE reluctantly opens 
    his shirt to look under his arm. He stares at something in 
      shock then quickly buttons up his shirt again. COYNE sees 
    his expression.

                                  COYNE
                    What is it, Tom? 

                                  PRICE
                    Nothing. (Pause) You re fine. Try 
                    to get some sleep.

    END on PRICE s face as he looks around uneasily at the 
      shouting and crying coming from the other cells.

      INT. CLUB. NIGHT 2.    23.353030

    The cries and shouts of the prisoners bleed into the 
      clatter and thump of a brutally loud sound system. Lights 
      swirl as we move through the dancers and finally come to 
      AALIMSADIQ.AL is slim, dark skinned and very handsome. He 
      dances well. A pretty redhead nearby smiles as they lock 
      eyes. The DJ s voice booms out as he fades down a record.

                                  DJ
                    Okay, people, here s an official 
                    message. I ve just been told the 
                    club has to close early...

      There is a roar of disapproval amongst the clubbers.

                                  DJ
                    Sorry, government orders. Blame 
                    the flu. (Pause) But we ve still 
                    got time to party!

    The revellers cheer. AL grabs the redhead s hand and shouts 
    in her ear.

                                  AL
                    Drink?

    She nods and he leads her to a roped off VIP section. The 
      BOUNCER lifts the rope to let them through. A WAITRESS 
      comes over.

                                  AL
                    Champagne. Cristal.

    He tips her generously and turns to the girl. 

                                  AL
                    What s your name?

                                  SIMONE
                    Simone.

                                  AL
                    Cute name. I m Al.

    She smiles drunkenly and kisses him. As they kiss we CHANGE 
      ANGLE to the dance floor. In the heat of the club everyone 
      looks sweaty and feverish. In half-glimpsed fragments we 
    see a GIRL collapsed on the floor surrounded by her friends 
      while A MAN drifts through the crowd, his face silvered 
      with sweat, lurching into people who push him away angrily. 
    AL takes no notice. It s just another drug and booze 
      fuelled night in club land.

                                                                          CUT TO:

    As DAVID helps ABBY back in through the door the lights 
      flicker and go out. ABBY looks up vaguely.

                                  ABBY
                    What s going on?

      DAVID looks around.

                                  DAVID
                    Must be a power cut... 

      ABBY is half-delirious now, her words emerging in a slurred 
      ramble.

                                  ABBY
                    There are candles in the hall 
                      cupboard... how long does the 
                    food in the freezer last? Is it 
                    24 hours or 48? Don t open the

                                  DAVID
                    The power will be back on soon.

    He helps her up the stairs.

      INT. GRANT HOUSE. BEDROOM. NIGHT 2.  23.393232

      DAVID steers ABBY towards the bed and sits her down on the 
      side, helping her take off her jacket. She looks at him, a 
      little frightened.

                                  ABBY
                    There s a lump under my arm.

    She lifts her arm. By the light of the moon we see the pink 
      lump has now swollen and hardened. DAVID recoils in horror. 
    She curls up on the pillow. DAVID looks at her in panic, 
      then grabs his mobile.

                                  ABBY
                    What are you doing?

                                  DAVID
                    Calling you a doctor.

    He tries the line but it is engaged. He thinks desperately, 
      then tries to lift her again but she cries out in protest.

    He pushes him away. COYNE slips to the floor and is too 
      weak to get up again. PRICE rushes to the door.

                    Help! Help, someone! 

    His pleas are met only by the delirious cries of the other 
      sick prisoners. PRICE looks round at COYNE and sees the 
      boy s feverish eyes gleaming in the darkness.

    One WOMAN lies on a row of chairs with a concerned

      a quiet corner.

                    We re getting reports of 
                    localised power outages and the

                      standstill. The picture s the 
                    same all over the country.

                                  WILLIS
                    Well, what are we doing? No 
                    matter how serious the flu might

                    None of our contingency plans 
                    allowed for the virus spreading 
                    so quickly. 

                                  WILLIS
                    We have to isolate people with 
                    the infection. Quarantine them if 
                    necessary...

      CARTER shakes his head in frustration and leads her to a 
      quieter part of the office where they won t be overheard.

                                  CARTER
                    It s already too late for that.

                    Virtually the entire population 
                    has already been exposed.

    She stares at him in shock as he continues as calmly as he 
      can.

                    The virus is much more aggressive

    She takes her drink and goes off down the hall. AL calls 
    out after her.

    AL grins and SIMONE heads off to the bathroom. He hurls 
      himself down on the sofa, turning on the big TV with the 
      remote as he looks at his emails. He glances up as SAMANTHA 
      WILLIS appears on the screen, chairing a panel of MEDICAL 
    and MILITARY experts. She looks cool and composed.

                    I think we have to treat internet 
                      speculation with a degree of 
                    suspicion at this point.

                    Try to get this down, Pat. It ll 
                    make you feel better.

    PAT gags and most of it goes down her T-shirt. She grips 
      Jenny s arm with a pleading look.

    is in chaos, with cars bumper to bumper. There is shouting 
    and confusion everywhere. The traffic lights have failed 
    and many of the drivers are out of their cars. A police car 
      pulls out of a junction, its siren blaring and immediately 
      grinds to a halt in the logjam. A POLICEMAN jumps out and 
      tries to direct the passenger traffic to the side of the 
      road but there is nowhere for anyone to go.

    the windows of a shop and reach in to help themselves to 
      plasma TVs, and other electronic goods. The kids scatter, 
      expensive hardware smashing to the ground as they run. 

      JENNY drags PAT to the station but a temporary sign reads: 
       Trams suspended until further notice.  JENNY nearly cries 
    in dismay, but looks at PAT desperately.

                    Jenny..?

      JENNY looks up to see ANYA RACZYNSKI (25) gazing at her. 
    The pretty young doctor is hollow-eyed with exhaustion. 
      JENNY looks at her desperately.

                                  JENNY
                    I didn t know what else to do.

                                  ANYA
                          (After a second)
                    Wait here.

    She rushes off. JENNY smiles encouragingly but PAT is 
      unresponsive. A moment later ANYA comes hurrying back with 
      a wheelchair. Between them they manage to get PAT into it. 

                                  JENNY
                    Will she be all right?

      ANYA doesn t reply. JENNY follows her down the hall. 


      INT. HOSPITAL. CORRIDORS. NIGHT 2.  00.364444

      A long queue of people snakes away down the corridor. A 
      NURSE goes down the line giving people flu jabs. ANYA leads 
      JENNY past, pushing the chair. She finds a trolley in an 
      alcove and they transfer PAT onto it. ANYA gazes at Pat, 
      then wipes the sweat tenderly from her forehead. She 
      glances at JENNY.

                                  ANYA
                    Give me a minute.

      JENNY nods and wanders away, looking back at the long line 
    of frightened people waiting for their jabs. She finds 
      herself by the half-closed door of a ward. As she passes 
    she glances inside, then stops. She goes closer and looks 
      inside, glancing back at ANYA, who is busy with Pat. 

      From JENNY s POV through the half-open door we see a 
      terrible sight. 

                                                                            (CONTINUED)

    The ward is overflowing with dead patients, some covered in 
      sheets, some in body bags. They are on beds, on the floor, 
    on trolleys. It is like something from a nightmare.

      JENNY reels back, trembling with shock. As she stands, 
      shaking, she sees ANYA bending to kiss PAT briefly on the 
      forehead. The young doctor looks across and realiseswhat 
    has happened. She rushes over, grabs Jenny s arm and yanks 
    her away angrily.

                                  ANYA
                    You re not allowed in there...

      JENNY stares at her wide-eyed with shock. 

                                  JENNY
                    How many..?

                                  ANYA
                    Hundreds in the last few hours 
                    alone. It s the same everywhere.

      JENNY holds her hands to her mouth as she tries not to 
      scream.  

                                  JENNY
                    But some people recover. You must 
                    have some who get through it...

    She reads her answer in Anya s face.

                                  JENNY
                    No one..?

                                  ANYA
                    Not yet.

      JENNY looks back at the queue of people waiting for a jab.

                                  JENNY
                    What about the jab? 

                                  JENNY
                    It s useless, just a fiction to 
                    keep the panic under control.

      JENNY slumps back against the wall, trembling with shock. 

                                  JENNY
                    Pat?

                    There must be some kind of 
                    treatment.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)

    The two young women look at each other, one disbelieving,

      EXT. STREET. NIGHT 2. 00.404646

      NAJID, 11, a young boy of Pakistani extraction, stands in 
    the road looking around in wonder as a crowd of neighbours
    and friends from the Muslim community walk past. There are 
      a few murmured greetings but the mood is sombre; many 
      people are supported by their friends and family, while one 
    man is carried on an improvised stretcher. They move 
      forward with a common purpose, their torches glimmering in 
    the darkness.

      NAJID has never seen anything like this. The strangeness of 
    it is overwhelming; he bumps into someone in the darkness, 
      earning an angry rebuke.

                                  MAN
                    Watch where you re going! 

      NAJID turns in the crowd, lost for a second, then sees his 
      father up ahead. He runs to catch up. His MOTHER leans on 
    his FATHER s shoulder, wiping her forehead with the sleeve 
    of her dress. His FATHER turns to him with a tired smile.

                                  FATHER
                    Keep up, Najid. We must stick 
                    together.

                    What are we doing, dad?

                    terrible sickness. 

    He touches his son s face affectionately.

                                  FATHER
                    There s nothing to be scared of.

    His father gives NAJID his copy of the Koran and places a 
      hand on his shoulder.

                                  FATHER
                    If anything happens... if you 
                    somehow find yourself alone, tell 
                    the authorities you have cousins 
                    in Blackburn. 

    He closes his eyes as a sharp pain stabs through his head. 

                                  NAJID
                    Are you all right, dad?

                    Come on. Your mother s waiting 
                    for us.

      NAJID hurries to catch up with his mother, who has moved 
      ahead.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. MOSQUE. PRAYER HALL. NIGHT 2.  00.454747

      NAJID follows his father into the candlelit prayer hall, 
      taking off his shoes as the women go upstairs. He finds a 
      spot on the crowded carpet. Muttered sounds of worship echo 
      around him. NAJID bows his head and begins to recite the 
      comforting words of the Koran, his hands cupped in front of 
    him in prayer. He notices that his father s face is shiny 
      with sweat in the candlelight.

    As the sounds of prayer echo quietly and the candle smoke 
      curls up to the ceiling -

                                                                          CUT TO:

      DAVID leans over the bed. The room is lit by the moon; the 
      power has long since gone off again. ABBY s eyes flicker 
      open and she stares at him. He smiles in relief.

                                  ABBY
                    I was having a strange dream. 

                                  DAVID
                    You re awake now. Does it hurt 
                    anywhere?

                                  ABBY
                    I feel like I m floating. It s 
                    quite nice. 

    He smiles. In the moonlight we see he has been crying. She 
      touches his face.

                                  ABBY
                    Are you crying?

                                  DAVID
                    Of course not.

    He bends quickly and kisses her head. She looks desperately 
      pale but smiles.

                                  ABBY
                    I love you.

                    I thought it didn t count when I 
                    was expecting it?

    She tries to smile but then a flicker of fear comes over 
    her face. She grabs his arm fiercely.

                                  ABBY
                    David? I m falling...

    Her head suddenly rolls to one side as she lapses into a 
      coma. DAVID looks at her frantically.

                                  DAVID
                    Abby..?

    He wraps her in the duvet and tries to lift her. Her head 
      lolls back and her eyes stare lifelessly. He puts her down 
    and feels frantically for a pulse in her neck. He finds 
      nothing. He cries out in horror.

      INT. MINISTRY OF HEALTH. OPEN PLAN OFFICE. NIGHT 2. 00.525151

    The place is now littered with coffee cups, sandwiches and 
      documents. Television screens relay a constant stream of 
      images of the crisis. There are many fewer people present. 
      SAMANTHA WILLIS sits drinking a cup of coffee. MARK CARTER 
      hands her a document. She reads it and is visibly shocked.

                                  WILLIS
                    This is it? This is what I m 
                    supposed to tell them?

                                  CARTER
                    I think that s up to you now. The 
                    Prime Minister died a few minutes 
                    ago.

      SAMANTHA stares, then looks back down at the document.

                                  WILLIS
                    How many millions?

                                  CARTER
                    If the infection carries on 
                      progressing at the current rate 
                    we re talking more than 90 per 
                    cent of the population.

      WILLIS stares at him, then glances around at the remaining 
      staff struggling to coordinate the crisis response.

                                  WILLIS
                    Tell everyone to go home as soon 
                    as the press conference is 
                    finished. They should be with 
                    their families. You too.

      A mobile rings and he takes it out of his pocket.

                                  CARTER
                    Of course, Jack. She s right 
                    here. (Pause) It s your husband. 
                    Better hurry. They don t think 
                    the mobile networks will last 
                    much longer.

      WILLIS takes the phone, covering the mouthpiece briefly as 
    she looks up at her young aide. 

                                  WILLIS
                    Thank you, Mark. You ve done a 
                    remarkable job.

                                  CARTER
                    It s been a privilege working 
                    with you, minister. 

      They gaze at each other in numbed silence before she 
      answers the phone, her manner bright and cheerful.

                                  WILLIS
                          (On Phone)
                    Jack? I m sorry. I couldn t phone 
                    earlier... (Pause, listens) All 
                    of you? The boys too? 

      Tears spring to her eyes but she speaks briskly.

                                  WILLIS
                    Are they in bed? Good. (Pause) 
                    No, I m fine. I ll be home soon. 
                    (Pause) Of course everything s 
                    going to be all right. It s just 
                    a nasty bug. (Pause) Jack? I love 
                    you.

    She hangs up, straightens her jacket and walks out.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. MINISTRY OF HEALTH. PRESS ROOM. NIGHT 2. 00.535252

    In a cramped and functional press room in the same building 
      SAMANTHA is on her own; the experts have gone and so have 
      most of the journalists. Only a few camera crews are left. 
    The mood is sombre. WILLIS stares directly into the camera.

                                  WILLIS
                    I can no longer disguise from you 
                    the fact that we are facing a 
                    very grave crisis. During this 
                    period of uncertainty it is 
                    possible there will be temporary 
                    losses of power and water. I urge 
                    you all to behave responsibly, to 
                    be good neighbours and to avoid 
                    panic....

                    possible your government will 
                    restore services and normalise 
                    the situation. 

    She pauses, then carries on calmly.

                                  WILLIS
                    Rest assured we continue to work 
                    on your behalf. In the meantime, 
                    good luck and God bless you all.

    We go CLOSER and CLOSER on her and then abruptly, the

      little by little power fails all over London.

      EXT. CITY STREETS. NIGHT 2.  01.005454

    The streets are now hauntingly still. Nothing moves and 
      there is no sound beyond a whining car alarm.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      A huge housing estate in an inner city area. Suddenly the 
      lights go out from block to block as though someone is 
      snuffing candles. The area is plunged into darkness. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

    The city viewed from the air, its lights illuminating the

    the power fails in area after area. In a few seconds the 
      whole city disappears as though someone has thrown a 
      blanket over it. 

    As the lights go out below, the moon seems to glow ever 
      brighter and the stars appear for the first time, shining 
      with indifferent prettiness.

      A poignantlylovely sunrise. Golden light filters over a 
      series of images of the desolate new reality of the disease 
      ravaged country -

      - roads stand silent, blocked with cars. Nothing moves.

      - houses stand quiet. There is little visible sign of the 
      horror, but we know that within each home lies the same 
      terrible story. 

      - cows stand in a field, lowing plaintively to be milked.

    - a shopping mall is eerily deserted.

    - a huge football stadium stands empty.

    - a dog sits in the back of a locked car, barking 
      frantically for an owner who will never come.

                                                                        FADE TO:

      Dawn light filters in through the windows. The prison is 
      ominously quiet. TOM PRICE sits by his bunk, fiercely 
      alert. Across the cell TONY COYNE lies on the floor, his 
      eyes staring. He is dead. 

    TOM looks up as he hears footsteps. He rushes to the door.

                                  PRICE
                    In here! Hey! 

      Keys rattle in the lock. WILSON walks in. He looks grey, 
    not with illness but a deep and terrible shock. He stares 
    at Coyne s body, then at PRICE.

                                  WILSON
                    There was nothing I could do. 

    As he looks at PRICE we see a sudden spasm of anger in his 
      eyes.

                                  WILSON
                    You re not even ill?

      PRICE shakes his head.

                                  WILSON
                    You know how many people are

                    They re all either dead or dying.

                    Just you and me.

      WILSON hits him. PRICE spins back against the wall, his 
      mouth bleeding. WILSON stares at him with hatred.

                                  WILSON
                    You should have been the first to 
                    go. Scum like you don t deserve 
                    to live.

      PRICE wipes the blood from his lip. 

                                  PRICE
                    So, what happens now?

      WILSON only stares at him then goes out, slamming the door. 
      PRICE reacts furiously.

                                  PRICE
                    You can t just leave me here...

    But he can already hear Wilson s footsteps moving away. 
      PRICE stares around the cell, facing the very real prospect 
    of dying of thirst or starvation.

      time. The digital display on his clock is blank. He sits up 
    and reaches instinctively for his BlackBerry, but there is 
    no signal. He sits up, confused. SIMONE lies beside him, 
      half-covered by the sheet. He shakes her shoulder.

      limbs stiffening with rigor mortis. AL yells in shock and

      blocking the road. It is freakishly silent. No cars, no 
      trains, no planes, none of the normal, comforting chaos of 
    the rush hour. AL opens his door and stares around.

      Seeing someone in the van he hurries over and bangs on the

      There is no response. Fear prickles at AL s skin. He flings

      more terrible. Most of the congregation are already dead; 
      some are still alive but are firmly in the grip of the

      open but unseeing.

      Najid s father has a protective arm slung around him but is

      suddenly the young boy blinks and sits up. He looks around,

                                                                          CUT TO:

      NAJID takes the stairs to the women s gallery two at a 
      time, shouting as he runs.

                                  NAJID
                    Mum! Mum!

    We STAY on the stairs rather than follow him any further. 
      There is no need to see the horror that awaits him. After a 
      moment he comes back down slowly, looking dazed and lost. 

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. MOSQUE. STREET. DAY 3. 11.386565

      NAJID emerges into the sunlight. He is used to the vibrant 
      urgency of a busy working class area, the crush of people, 
    the laughter and shouting, the everyday life he takes for 
      granted. But that is all gone now, vanished as though swept 
      away in a conjurer s trick. Empty of people, completely 
      silent, the street looks like an alien world. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. HOSPITAL. STAFF ROOM. DAY 3.  11.396666

      ANYA sits in a chair letting the early rays of the sun play 
    on her face. She looks tired to the point of collapse but 
      finally drags herself to her feet. 

      Then, as she stands up, we see JENNY lies next to her, a 
      tartan blanket up to her chin. She looks like a child, 
      peacefully asleep. ANYA gently draws the blanket up over 
    her face. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      NAJID walks along the balcony towards his flat. He stops to 
      stare out. The normally busy estate is completely silent.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      NAJID s bedroom is a typical boy s room, complete with 
      football posters, school books and clothes tossed all over 
    the floor. He sits on the edge of his bed and after a 
      moment simply gets in and pulls the duvet over his head.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. PRISON. PRICE S CELL. DAY 3.  11.416868

      PRICE roots through Coyne s things, ignoring the young 
      man s body, which he has covered with a blanket. He finds a 
      bottle of water. It is virtually empty but he unscrews the 
    cap and drains the last few drops. He throws the bottle 
      away, then goes back to crouching against the wall, his 
      pent-up fury contained in a powerful stillness. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      earphones clamped into his ears. He taps his feet nervously 
    and stares at the blank screen of his now useless Hi-Def 
    TV.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. HOSPITAL. CORRIDORS. DAY 3.  11.437070

      ANYA walks down the corridor, her footsteps echoing in the 
      silence. After the chaos of the previous day the silence is 
      harrowing. Somewhere close many hundreds of people lie 
      dead, but we do not need to see them. Anya s face tells us 
      everything we need to know about the suffering she has 
      witnessed.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. HOSPITAL. PHARMACY. DAY 3.  11.447171

      ANYA goes through the shelves quickly and methodically. She 
      reads a label and finds what she wants. She empties out a 
      handful of pills then adds another dozen to be certain. She 
      takes a bottle of water. She stares at the pills for a long 
      second. We understand immediately that she is planning to 
      commit suicide. A tear rolls down her cheek but she brushes 
    it away angrily and takes one pill, then another. A third 
    and a fourth follow...

    ... and then she suddenly stops. She stares at the pills, 
      waits another beat, then releases a terrible, inarticulate 
    cry of rage and pain and throws them away. She howls like a 
      wounded animal, sweeping the medicines off the shelves, 
      smashing bottles, sending flasks clattering, lashing out at 
      anything she can find in her terrible despair and fury, 
      exorcising her piercing grief for lost lovers and friends, 
      grief for a tragedy she could do nothing to prevent, a 
      grief beyond imagining or consolation. 

      Finally, all her energy spent, she slides down to the 
      floor, crying bitterly, like a lost child.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. HOSPITAL. COURTYARD. DAY 3. 12.007272

      ANYA walks out into the empty forecourt. It is a pleasant 
      afternoon, a gentle breeze blowing. She takes off her 
      doctor s white coat and lets it flutter to the ground. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      There is no one to be seen and nothing moves. The silence 
    and emptiness of the once busy city are haunting. In a 
      brief series of shots we see the sun sink and then rise 
      again. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. PRISON. PRICE S CELL. DAY 4.  14.027575

      PRICE paces the cell like a rat in a cage. He suddenly 
      hears footsteps and hurls himself to the door.

                                  PRICE
                    Hey! In here!

    The door is unlocked and WILSON comes in. He throws a 
      bottle of water and Price catches it, drinking greedily and 
      spilling the water down his shirt. 

                                  WILSON
                    I was going to leave you to die. 
                    But I couldn t do it. I m not an 
                    animal like you. 

    He is nearly blacking out with exhaustion, but as PRICE 
      moves he snaps awake, taking a tazergun from his belt. He 
      gestures that PRICE should go ahead of him out of the cell.

                                  WILSON
                    Keep where I can see you.

      locked but a few doors stand open. He sees glimpses of 
      bodies in bunks. 

                                  PRICE
                    Is it as bad as this outside?

      INT. WANDSWORTH PRISON. STORAGE ROOM. DAY 4. 14.047777

      WILSON stops PRICE in front of a storage cupboard. The 
      small room is stuffed with blankets and prison uniforms 
      piled on shelves. There is a small barred window high up on 
    one wall. On the floor is a pack of bottled water, a few 
      chocolate bars and a loaf of bread. 

                                  PRICE
                    You can t be serious.

                    Someone will come for you.

                    I m not going in there... 

      WILSON jabs the tazer in his chest and he goes down, 
      yelling and writhing in shock. WILSON stands over him.

                                  WILSON
                    You re a prisoner of Her 
                    Majesty s Government. You ll do 
                    what you re bloody told.

                    You enjoyed that, didn t you?

    He staggers to his feet, struggling to catch his breath. 
      WILSON stares at him with hatred.

                                  WILSON
                    You ve got twenty years left to 
                    serve, Price. And no matter what 
                    happens, I intend to see you do 
                    every last one of them. Now get 
                    in.

    He finds the store room key on his ring. As he looks down 
    we GO CLOSE on the sleeve of PRICE s shirt as he works 
      something out of it - a screwdriver sharpened to a point 
    and taped to a wooden handle. He palms it as he looks at  
      WILSON, his tone calm and reasonable.

                                  PRICE
                    You know, you don t have to do 
                    this, Mr. Wilson. 

                                  WILSON
                    What are you talking about?

                                  PRICE
                    You could just look the other way 
                    while I walk out that door. 
                    Nothing s the same now. The old 
                    rules don t apply.

                    Get in there.

                                  PRICE
                    I m giving you a chance. Let me 
                    go and I ll just disappear. We ll 
                    never bother each other again.

      WILSON raises the tazerthreateningly but PRICE is ready 
    for him this time. He ducks away, grabs his arm and stabs 
      upwards with his other hand. WILSON gasps, drops the tazer
    to the floor and looks in surprise at the wound in his 
      stomach. 

      PRICE stabs him again, plunging the blade calmly and 
      precisely between his ribs into his heart. WILSON sinks to 
    the floor, fatally injured. PRICE looks down at him.

                                  PRICE
                    Now that s what I call ironic.

                    and get yourself killed over 
                    something stupid like this. 

    He throws the blade away, steps over the dying WILSON and 
      walks towards the door.

                                  PRICE
                    I offered you a fair deal. You 
                    should have taken it.

      ANYA walks down the street, her bag slung over her

      turns to look behind her. A car is speeding towards her on 
    the wrong side of the road. It is a Police patrol car, its 
      blue light flashing and siren wailing. She stops and leaps

      There is a mad grin on his face and he gives ANYA the 
      finger as he goes past. ANYA stares after him in disbelief. 
    Is this what the world is going to be like now?

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. CITY. CANAL. DAY 4.  20.018181

      ANYA walks down by the canal as the light begins to fade. 
      Barges are moored to the side. ANYA suddenly knows she 
      doesn t want to go any further tonight; in any case, she 
    has nowhere particular to go. She sees a gaily painted 
      barge and hops onto it. Out of habit she knocks on the 
      door, which is open. Inside, it is mercifully free of 
      bodies. ANYA looks around, then slips inside.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      ANYA sits on the deck, enjoying the last of the sunlight. 
    It is peaceful, even beautiful in the warm evening. She 
      eats a tin of peaches, glancing up as a seabird glides low 
      over the canal before wheeling away gracefully. Although 
      nothing can soften the deadening despair in her heart, for 
      a moment at least she is at peace. She opens her bag and 
      takes out a creased photograph of her, Jenny and Pat in a 
      club somewhere raising their glasses to the camera. She 
      stares at it for a second, then lets it slip from her 
      fingers into the canal.

      Once more the city sinks into darkness. There is something 
      sinister in the total blackness that sinks over the once 
      brightly illuminated landscape. Night is like a curtain 
      being drawn across the day. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      ABBY GRANT lies in bed. Her eyes are open and staring; the 
      horrible aura of death hangs heavily over the room. 

    But ABBY is not dead. Suddenly her eyelids flutter and her 
      throat contracts in a rasping cough. She gags as she 
      struggles to suck in oxygen. It is as though she is being 
      born again, wrenched from death and trust back into life.

      With a huge effort of will she swings her legs out of the 
      bed. She collapses and sits on the floor panting with 
      shock.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. GRANT HOUSE. BATHROOM. DAY 5. 08.068585

      ABBY staggers to the tap and puts her mouth to it. The cold 
      water runs over her face. She drinks desperately, then 
      reels back feeling sick. She leans against the wall and 
      sees her own reflection in the mirror. She stares in shock 
    at her gaunt, muck stained face, soiled T-shirt and 
      pyjamas. She looks like a filthy shadow of her normal self.

    She strips off her pyjamas and drags herself to the shower. 
    She turns on the hot water but nothing emerges. She turns 
    to the cold and gasps in shock as the water hits her. She 
      forces herself to stay under the chilly stream of water, 
      desperate to scrub off the stink of her illness. But after 
      a moment the water slows to a trickle as the tank empties. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      ABBY, now dressed in a fresh T-shirt and jeans, walks down 
    the stairs, leaning heavily on the bannister. She tries the 
      light switch.

                    David?

    The silence is oppressive. She looks around fearfully.

    The fridge is surrounded by a pool of water. ABBY flinches 
    at the smell. She looks in the bread bin but the loaf is 
      mouldy. Glancing in the cupboards she finds some cheese 
      biscuits and a bottle of water. She eats and drinks 
      greedily, messily, feeling stronger all the time.

                                                                          CUT TO:

    The room is in semi-darkness. ABBY goes over to the window 
    and opens the curtains. For a second the view is 
      reassuring. Everything looks so normal she almost smiles. 

      Suddenly it feels wonderful to be alive. 

      Then, we see (but Abby doesn t yet) that DAVID is lying on 
    the sofa, his mobile near his outstretched hand. His eyes 
    are open. He has been dead for some time. 

      Only a moment later does ABBY turn and see him. 

    Her wrenching cry of horror echoes through the silent 
      house.

      ABBY dashes back out into the street, overwhelmed by panic. 
    She rushes from house to house, shouting frantically.

                                  ABBY
                    Hello! Please, is anyone there. 
                    Someone please help me.

    She sees an open door and goes into another house, but 
      emerges only seconds later, pale and shocked. She stumbles 
      into the middle of the street, a terrible fear clutching 
      violently at her heart. A desperate plea springs to her 
      lips.

                                  ABBY
                    Oh, God. Please don t let me be

      Rubbish blows along the deserted street. TOM PRICE walks 
      casually around the corner, looking for all the world like 
      a man enjoying a simple trip down to the newsagent.He 
      wears new jeans and trainers and a smart jacket. He carries 
      a sports bag. He drinks from a bottle of water as he goes. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      A key turns in the lock. PRICE walks in. He stands in the 
      hall. The flat is neat and quiet, a small two bedroom place 
    on the ground floor. 

                                  PRICE
                    Mum?

    He walks down the hall and looks in through the bedroom 
      door. We change angle to a WOMAN in her 60slying in the 
      bed. She is dead, sprawled out of the covers. A broken 
      glass lies on the floor. PRICE touches her face gently.

    The patio is only a few yards square and covered with 
      potted plants. PRICE clears the pots out of the way so that 
    he can see the paving underneath. He gets down on his knees 
      holding a hammer and chisel. He begins to chip away at the 
      cement until he can move the heavy paving stone to one 
      side. The space underneath it is hollow. He reaches down 
    and brings out a rucksack wrapped in plastic. He throws the 
      protective covering to one side and opens the bag. Inside 
    we see many thousands of pounds.

      PRICE gazes at the money, then opens a side pocket and 
      brings out a handgun.

      comes out. Frustrated and desperate he goes to the already 
      open cupboards, frantic for anything he can eat or drink. 
    But he was never the kind of man to keep much in - he 
      always ate out or had takeaways. Now, all he can find in 
    the spotlessly neat cupboards is a single tin of caviar and 
      a few bottles of champagne. 

    He opens the caviar, wolfing it down greedily with a 
      dessert spoon. He washes it down with gulps of vintage 
      champagne.

      covering his face falls away and the blankness of his 
      expression nearly overwhelms her. She half slips to the 
      ground as a wrenching sob racks her body. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      voice cracking.

                    I have to find Peter now. I ll 
                    look after him. I promise.

    Her hands shake so violently she can barely strike the 
      match on the side of the packet. It flares for a second 
      then fizzles out. ABBY cries in despair, then tries again, 
      striking match after match until finally the fire bursts 
      into life. She has to turn away quickly as she is scorched 
    by the sudden ferocity of the blaze.

    bag in one hand and her mobile in the other. She pauses, 
      glancing back once at the column of smoke rising from the 
      garden. She hesitates, her heart breaking, but then forces 
      herself to leave behind everything she has ever known and 
      loved.

      urban landmarks, serene and haunting in their emptiness.

      After a moment AL s powerful sports car surges down the 
      road. He drives fast, looking around for signs of life, the 
      champagne bottle still in one hand.

                    south.

                                  NAJID
                    I m not allowed to accept lifts 
                    from strange men.

                                  AL
                    Fair enough. 

      NAJID shrugs, determined not to show his terror and 
      vulnerability. AL looks at him awkwardly.

                                  AL
                    You ll be all right. In a few 
                    days everything will be back to 
                    normal. 

                                  NAJID
                    You reckon?

    AL looks out over the deserted city with as much optimism 
    as he can muster.

                                  AL
                    Yeah, probably. (Pause) I d take 
                    you with me but it s complicated.

                                  NAJID
                    I wasn t asking.

    He picks up his bag and turns away. AL looks after him 
      guiltily.

                                  AL
                    I wouldn t know how to look after 
                    a little boy. I m not really the 
                    parental type.

                    I m not little. I m eleven. 

    AL shrugs then goes back to his car. He drives away. NAJID 
      watches him, his little face blank.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. AL S CAR. DAY 5. 14.09106106

      NAJID stands forlornly in the road, as the engine noise 
      fades. But then after a second it grows louder again and 
      Al s car reappears around the corner. It stops in front of 
      him. AL opens the passenger door.

                                  AL
                    Get in.

                                  NAJID
                    I told you. I don t need looking 
                    after.

                                  AL
                    Just bloody get in. 

      NAJID shrugs and finally slings his bag on the back seat.

                                  NAJID
                    No funny stuff, okay?

                                  AL
                    What?

                                  NAJID
                    You re not a paedophile, are you?

                                  AL
                    No, I am not a bloody paedophile.
                    Now get in.

      NAJID gets in the front seat and straps himself in 
      carefully. He looks at AL.

                                  NAJID
                    Belt.

                    What?

                                  NAJID
                    You should put your belt on.

    AL looks at him, then at his belt.

                                  AL
                    Oh, yeah. Right. 

    He does it, then puts the car into gear and drives away.

                                  AL
                    Have you got your cousins  
                    address? 

      NAJID shakes his head. AL looks at him in exasperation.

      NAJID nods solemnly.

                    So where are we going?

    AL stares back at him. He has no idea. He puts the car in 
      gear, swigs from the champagne bottle and then gives it to 
      NAJID to hold. The boy promptly opens the window and chucks 
    it out into the road.

      ANYA leaves the barge almost reluctantly. She knows she 
      must move on but the peaceful canal was a momentary respite 
      from the uncertain horror of the future. She steps down 
      onto the embankment, slings her bag back over her shoulder 
    and moves on.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      majestic beauty of the countryside comes as a breath of 
      fresh air. A car makes its way through the countryside, 
      winding up a solitary road through the Peak district. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

    The pub stands in a scenic spot overlooking the valley. A 
      single car sits in the car park. ABBY drives in and gets 
      out. She stares at the other car. A WOMAN DRIVER sits at 
    the wheel. ABBY hurries across to her.

                                  ABBY
                    Can you help me, please? I ve run 
                    out of petrol.

      Only now does she realisethat the woman is dead.

      ABBY gazes at her, then forcing herself to open the door, 
    she puts her hands under her arms and drags her out, laying 
    her gently on the gravel. She gazes at the young woman s 
      body sadly.

                                  ABBY
                    I m sorry.

    She walks quickly back to her own car, taking out her bag 
    and a few other essentials.

      during the current flu epidemic the centre is now closed.

                    Hello?

    She walks along the hall towards the dormitories. She says 
      a silent prayer, then opens a door. She reels back, the 
      smell of decomposing bodies making her retch. She finds a 
      handkerchief and puts it over her mouth and nose. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      There are six beds in each dormitory. ABBY walks past each 
    of them, overwhelmed with sadness and fear. Each bed has 
    the outline of a small body under the covers. Someone has 
      covered them all with a blanket. We see nothing of the 
      wretched sight beneath but ABBY has no option. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

    She looks under every blanket. Her eyes fill with tears as 
    she does it.

    We can tell from her anguished relief that none of the boys 
    is Peter. As she leaves the room she catches sight of a 
      pathetic pile of rucksacks in the corner. Only now does she 
      nearly give way to the horror welling inside her but she 
      quickly closes the door and moves on to the next room. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

    As ABBY comes to the last room she finds three or four beds 
    are empty. She has only one body left to check. She lifts 
    the blanket. We can tell from her reaction it is not Peter. 
    She half-laughs, then feels terrible for her own feeling of 
      overwhelming relief. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      ABBY comes into the office. A MAN (BROWN) in a sweater and 
      heavy boots lies with his head slumped on the desk in front 
    of his computer. ABBY stops in the doorway, knowing he is 
      dead. She looks away wearily and turns to go...

    ... then feels a touch on her arm and spins back with a 
      scream of shock. BROWN stands looking at her, very much 
      alive.

                                  BROWN
                    I m sorry. I didn t mean to 
                    frighten you. 

      ABBY gazes at him, stupefied. 

                                  BROWN
                    I should have said something...

                    I recovered.

    He looks at her in surprise, but then rallies quickly.

    He smiles, a glint of excitement in his eye. NEIL looks at 
    him uncertainly and PRICE quickly changes the subject.

                                  PRICE
                    Did you lose anyone?

                    within an hour of each other. 

    He lies with easy fluency, taking Prison Officer Wilson s 
      story as his own. NEIL smiles sympathetically, then follows 
      PRICE S glance at Cathy.

                                  NEIL
                    She doesn t say much. I found her 
                    in a kids playground, just 
                    sitting on a swing. 

    He thinks for a second, then, then suddenly decides.

                                  NEIL
                    You re welcome to ride along with 
                    us, if you want.

      PRICE glances down. CATHY s coat has fallen open and her 
      short skirt reveals a lot of leg. PRICE takes in the sight, 
      then looks up at NEIL with a charming smile.

                                  PRICE
                    Why not? 

                                  NEIL
                    Great. You can share the driving. 
                    (Pause) Sling your bag in the 
                    back.

      PRICE glances at his bag and smiles casually.

                                  PRICE
                    I ll keep it with me.

      BROWN emerges from the centre carrying coffee and biscuits 
    on a tray.

                                  ABBY
                    Oh, bourbons for me, every time. 
                    Fig rolls are too chewy. 

    She has a brief moment of confusion as she looks at him. He 
      notices her expression. 

                                  BROWN
                    Are you okay?

                                  ABBY
                    Everything just seems so normal. 
                    It s hard to believe all those 
                    children are upstairs...

    She stops. BROWN looks at her sympathetically. 

                                  BROWN
                    I pretend it s morning and 
                    they re all still asleep. I was 
                    always an early riser. I m used 
                    to being the only one around.

    He smiles sadly. He is a shaggy sort of man in early middle 
      age, with long hair and windblown features. It is easy to 
      guess that he has lived much of his life outdoors. 

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. CASTLE CRAG ADVENTURE CENTRE. DAY 5.  16.30120120

      ABBY and BROWN walk together. ABBY gazes out but doesn t 
      really see anything. BROWN s voice is gentle as they talk 
      about the terrible events of the last few days.

                                  BROWN
                    Peter was one of the first boys 
                    to fall ill. At that point we 
                    didn t know what was coming, of 
                    course. 

                                  ABBY
                    I spoke to him in the morning. I 
                    knew something wasn t right.

                                  BROWN
                          (Nods)
                    In the end Phil Emerson decided 
                    to drive him down to the 
                    hospital. I stayed behind with 
                    the other kids.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      ABBY looks at him desperately.

                                  ABBY
                    But he was still alive when he 
                    left?

                                  BROWN
                    He was very sick, Mrs. Grant. And 
                    no one else recovered.

                                  ABBY
                    I did!

                          (Fiercely)
                    But you don t know. You don t 
                    know for certain he s dead.

                                  BROWN
                          (After a second)
                    No, I don t.

      ABBY looks at him, suddenly frantic to be away.

                                  ABBY
                    I have to go. He could be looking 
                    for me right now...

      BROWN gets up and stops her urgently.

                                  BROWN
                    You can t drive now. You re 
                    exhausted...

                                  ABBY
                    I m fine...

                                  BROWN
                    It s dangerous at night now. 
                    There are no lights. How would 
                    you find your way around the 
                    city?

      ABBY doesn t want to listen but has to concede the wisdom 
    of this.

                                  BROWN
                    Stay for tonight. Rest.

    She stares at him, hating it but knowing he s right.

                                                                          CUT TO:

    The room is lit by oil lamps and candles. BROWN heats soup 
    on the gas ring. ABBY stands by a notice board staring at 
      pictures of the boys abseiling, climbing etc. 

    She looks frantically from picture to picture until she 
      finds what she is looking for - PETER. 

    He is seated in or near a canoe, a helmet obscuring part of 
    his face. He smiles at the camera. One of the adventure 
      centre supervisors stands behind him, his face turned away 
    in profile. He is tall, in his mid 20s.

      BROWN looks up.

                                  BROWN
                    That s Phil with Peter.
                          (pause)
                    Take it.

      ABBY smiles gratefully. She takes the picture back to the 
      table and gazes at it for a second before putting it in her 
      pocket.

                                  ABBY
                    What will you do now?

                                  BROWN
                    I ll have to bury the boys. Then 
                    I ll walk in the Peaks, climb a 
                    little. Life won t be so very 
                    different.

                                  ABBY
                    Not many of us can say that.

    He serves the soup. Out of habit she checks her mobile. 
      BROWN smiles as he glances at it.

                                  BROWN
                    That way of life is finished. 
                    Mobile phones, computers, the 
                      electricity that powers them. All 
                    gone for good.

                    the last time you did anything

                    a pig. Or grew a vegetable. Do 
                    you know which mushrooms are okay 
                    to eat and which ones will kill 
                    you? That s the kind of knowledge

                                  ABBY
                    We still have books. We can learn 
                    what we need from them.

                    civilisation for ever. We have to 
                    start all over again, relearn all 
                    the skills we ve forgotten. 

    He goes on, warming passionately to his theme.

                                  BROWN
                    We ve become like helpless

                    what it actually means to be 
                    human.

      ABBY looks shaken but refuses to give in to his pessimism.

                    Perhaps I have more faith in

                    right. But the work starts now. 
                    And mobile phones won t help.

      ABBY glances at her mobile with a self-deprecating smile.

                    I ll hang onto it for now. Just 
                    in case.

      comfort in its faint glow. The battery is running down but 
    she is reluctant to turn it off. Allowing the screen to go

    AL wakes up in the car with a jolt. He looks completely 
      wrecked, his eyes bleary and his chin covered in stubble. 
    He blinks as he feels the pain of his hangover. He jumps as 
      NAJID appears suddenly at the window. He winds it down.

                                  AL
                    God, my  head... what happened?

                    You were drunk. You fell asleep. 

    AL looks at him, then rubs his eyes.

                                  NAJID
                    I m hungry.

    He looks at NAJID incredulously. The little boy takes no

      NAJID takes a clean sweater out of his bag and places it on 
    the ground, then kneels down on it. 

                                  NAJID
                    Which way s east?

                    How do I know?

      NAJID chooses a direction at random and kneels down. AL 
      takes pity on him.

                                  AL
                    That s north. East is that way. 

    He points. NAJID bows his head, his hands cupped in front 
    of him. AL watches him. NAJID looks up at him.

                    You still believe in God after 
                    all this?

    He sweeps an arm in the direction of the silent houses.

                                  NAJID
                    Of course I do.

    AL ambles back to his car.


      INT. AL S CAR. DAY 6. 10.06124A124A

    AL gets in the car and switches on the ignition. He takes 
      some comfort in the powerful roar of the engine and then 
      frowns as it promptly dies. He looks at the petrol gauge 
      which stands at empty.

                                  AL
                    Oh, great.

    He looks away petulantly.

                                  NAJID

      ANYA walks through the deserted streets. She hardly seems 
    to know where she s going, but just moves forward at a 
      steady pace staring straight ahead.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. CORNER SHOP. DAY 6.  12.20127127

    TOM PRICE and CATHY wait by the car outside the shop. NEIL 
      emerges carrying a box full of groceries. He dumps it in 
    the back of the car. CATHY looks at everything anxiously.

                                  CATHY
                    There s such a lot. Can we afford 
                    all this, Neil?

    He exchanges a quick glance with PRICE then looks back at 
      her, his voice gentle.

                                  NEIL
                    Course we can. 

    She nods, her pretty face clouding with the struggle of 
      understanding what has happened to them. NEIL smiles 
      encouragingly.

                                  NEIL
                    Just a couple more things.

      NEIL goes back inside the shop. CATHY leans into the car 
      trying to push the heavy box to one side to make more room. 
    Her skirt stretches up her legs as she does it. TOM PRICE 
      watches her. She looks round and he smiles.

                                  PRICE
                    I ve got it.

    He leans in next to her and pushes the box into place, they 
    are only a few inches apart. He smiles.

                                  PRICE
                    You look nice in that dress. It 
                    suits you. You ve got good legs. 

    She bites her lip but says nothing. 

                                  PRICE
                    Who did you lose? Husband? Kids? 
                    (Pause) Did you hear what I said?

    She nods.

                                  PRICE
                    Good. I was beginning to think 
                    you were a bit simple. (Pause) I 
                    know it seems bad now but you ll 
                    be okay. We ve all got to look 
                    after each other.

    He strokes her cheek gently with his finger. It is barely 
      more than a touch but the effect is electrifying. CATHY 
      screams as though she has been stabbed. PRICE stares in 
      disbelief.

                                  PRICE
                    For God s sake, shut up...

    He grabs her roughly, which only makes her scream more. 
      NEIL comes running out of the shop.

                                  NEIL
                    What happened? 

                                  PRICE
                    She just started screaming. 

      CATHY is crying and shaking. NEIL takes her in his arms and 
    she lets him hold her. 

                                  NEIL
                    It s okay. You re all right. 

    He looks accusingly at PRICE, who shrugs innocently.

    At the same moment ABBY drives aggressively through the 
      empty streets. Nothing is going to stop her finding her 
      son. She drives into the hospital entrance, picking a way 
      through the litter of abandoned cars and ambulances. She 
      stops near A&E and jumps out. The sliding doors are closed. 
    She pushes and pulls at them but with no result. They are 
      firmly locked, clamped in place when the power went off. 
    She scrabbles her fingers into the gap between the doors 
    but with no result. 

    She shouts in frustration and beats on the doors furiously. 
    But she will not be stopped, not now.

      ABBY sits in the car. She can hardly believe what she is 
      about to do. For a moment she feels like the old Abby 
      standing outside her body and staring at herself in wonder; 
    but that woman, the happy, unassuming home-maker and 
      mother, is gone forever. 

    She takes a deep breath, then stamps on the accelerator and 
      drives the car straight at the entrance.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      From inside we see the car approaching at speed. The impact 
    as it hits the glass doors is like a bomb going off. Glass 
      explodes everywhere as the doors give way and the car 
      smashes into the foyer. It comes to a judderinghalt, 
      brakes screeching and engine whining.  

      ABBY switches off the engine and gets out. The car is 
      battered and crumpled but basically okay. ABBY stands for a 
      second, shaking but strangely exhilarated, as though the 
      shock has woken her to the reality of the new world. She 
      runs off down the hall, shouting.

                                  ABBY
                    Peter! Peter?

    But her adrenaline fuelled optimism doesn t last long in 
    the face of grim reality. We have only the briefest 
      glimpses of the bodies piled on beds and trolleys but the 
      impact is terrible. ABBY reels back, dazed. She tries to 
      force herself on but can t do it. She has seen too much 
      death already. She stumbles back out into the corridor and 
      leans against the wall, closing her eyes against the 
      horror, her shout now a wail of despair.

                                  ABBY
                    Peter!

      Only now does she fully understand the hopelessness of the 
      task. The thought that there is a living soul in this place 
    is unimaginable. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

    She sits down on a bench and puts her hands to her head. 
    The hope of finding Peter alive has kept her going so far 
    but now she has no idea what to do or where to go. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

    But elsewhere in the city other people are adjusting more 
      readily to the new world. 

    The shop s glass door gives way under a series of blows 
      from a baseball bat. A hand reaches in and opens the latch. 

      GREG PRESTON (30s) opens the door and walks in. He is 
      handsome, tall and fit. He looks around, his manner alert 
    and watchful, as any looter s might be. The shop is well 
      stocked. Greg goes around the shelves picking up tents, 
      sleeping bags, calor gas stoves and so on. Satisfied with 
    his haul he goes to the door, but then pauses and turns 
      back to the counter. We wonder what he is thinking. 

      Then, surprisingly, he reaches inside his jacket, finds his 
      wallet and takes out a couple of notes. Smiling wryly at 
      himself, he leaves them on the counter. 

      Greg Preston is clearly no ordinary looter. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

    car is a big four wheel drive already well stocked with 
      provisions - canned food, water, matches and tools. Every 
      square inch of luggage space is stuffed with vital 
      commodities. He slides his baseball bat across the 
      passenger seat and gets in. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      ABBY drives fast away from the hospital. She sees a speed 
      camera ahead and instinctively slows, then gives a hollow 
      laugh at the absurdity of it. She accelerates instead, 
      racing past the camera in a blur. She hardly cares now what 
    she does, but the speed and recklessness of the driving is 
      strangely comforting. She tears through junctions without 
      even looking, smiling grimly at traffic lights that will 
      never turn red again. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

    As she comes to a roundabout she hurtles across it without 
      bothering to slow down. There is nothing coming and there 
      never will be, so why bother?

    The last thing in the world she is expecting is another car 
    to emerge on her left. She spins the wheel frantically as 
    she suddenly sees it looming in her windscreen. 

      There is a screeching of brakes as they skid trying to 
      avoid each other but Abby can t prevent her already 
      battered car ramming the other one with a judderingimpact.

                    I ve said, I m sorry. Is your car 
                    badly damaged?

    He inspects the scrape on the side of his car. 

                                  GREG
                    It s okay. 

    He looks at her in disbelief but by now she has had enough.

                                  ABBY
                    Well, you didn t stop either.

                                  GREG
                    I had right of way. You do know 
                    how to drive, don t you?

                                  ABBY
                    Fine. It was my fault. Do you 
                    want my insurance details?

                                  GREG
                    Is that supposed to be funny?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                          (After a moment)
                    I thought so.

      Suddenly a laugh bubbles up unstoppably in her throat. She 
      can t help it.

                                  ABBY
                    Your face. You look so pompous. 
                     You do know how to drive, don t 
                    you . Men...

    She gulps again, a sound as much like a sob as a laugh and 
    in truth something of both. GREG gazes at her for a second, 
      then he too finally relaxes and begins to laugh as well.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. ROAD. ROUNDABOUT. DAY 6. 12.35136136

      ABBY and GREG sit together in the middle of the roundabout. 
    He pours her hot tea from a thermos and adds long life 
      milk. She drinks it gratefully. 

                                  ABBY
                    I never really appreciated how 
                    wonderful tea is before. 

                                  GREG
                    The milk won t last long. I ll 
                    have to get hold of a cow before 
                    long. Or a goat.

                                  ABBY
                    Is that what you re going to do? 
                    Find a farm?

                                  GREG
                          (Nods)
                    Just a small place where I can 
                    grow a few things, keep a few 
                    animals.

                                  ABBY
                    You make it sound quite nice. 

                                  GREG
                    It won t be. It ll be hard work. 

                                  ABBY
                    You ll have other people to help.

                                  GREG
                    I don t need other people. 
                    (Pause) What about you?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  ABBY
                    I was looking for my son... now I 
                    don t know what to do. 

    She shrugs uncertainly. He gazes at her.

                                  GREG
                    You can t stay in the city. It s 
                    too dangerous.

                                  ABBY
                    I ve had the virus.

                                  GREG
                    I m talking about cholera, 
                    typhoid, all the diseases that 
                    come with millions of unburied 
                    bodies. In a few months these 
                    places will be hell.

    She looks at him. She had barely even thought about it. He 
      stands up and throws away the remains of his tea. 

                                  GREG
                    I better get going. 

                                  ABBY
                    You re on a tight schedule, then?

    He smiles, taking her teasing in good part. 

                                  GREG
                    I want to keep moving.

    He gets up, then hesitates, looking back at her dazed and 
      uncertain expression.

                                  GREG
                    You have to live, you know. 
                    (Pause) You owe it to the people 
                    you loved to keep going. That s 
                    what they d want. 

    She stares at him and nods slowly. 

                                  ABBY
                    If I recovered, maybe my son did 
                    too. Maybe he s out there 
                    somewhere. 

                                  GREG
                    All the more reason to keep 
                    yourself fit and well. Then if 
                    you do find him, you can be ready 
                    to make a fresh start. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

    She smiles gratefully.

                                  ABBY
                    You really think he might be 
                    alive?

                                  GREG
                          (Smiles)
                    Miracles happen. Even now. 

    As he walks to his car she looks after him wistfully, 
      suddenly appalled at the thought of being alone. He senses 
    it and looks back. 

                                  GREG
                          (After a second)
                    You can travel with me for a 
                    while, if you want. (Pause) 
                    You re obviously not safe driving 
                    yourself.

                          (Smiles)
                    I m actually a very good driver. 

    He glances at the ruin of her car and smiles.

                                  GREG
                    Yeah. So I see.

                                  ABBY
                    It s a long story. (Pause) I d 
                    like that. 

                                  GREG
                    It s just for now though. I ve 
                    got plans of my own. 

    She nods in acknowledgement of this. 

                                  GREG
                    I m Greg Preston, by the way.

    She smiles, more relieved than she will admit to have some 
      company at the start of the long, strange journey that lies 
      ahead.

      INT. NEIL S CAR. MOTORWAY. DAY 6. 12.35137137

      NEIL drives while TOM sits in the front passenger seat and 
      CATHY is behind. The car bulges with provisions. 

                                  NEIL
                    We just need somewhere decent to 
                    stay until things get sorted out. 
                    Once everything s back to normal 
                    we can hook up with someone else, 
                    put down a few roots. 

    He smiles, glancing back at CATHY.

                                  NEIL
                    It won t be so bad, will it, 
                    Cath?

    She smiles nervously. 

                                  NEIL
                    I m starving. See what you can 
                    find for us, love. I put the 
                    biscuits down somewhere.

      CATHY picks up the nearest bag, without realisingit is 
      Price s hold-all. She unzips it, then stares down in 
      puzzlement at the gun sitting on top of wads of bank notes. 
    She pulls it out. 

                                  CATHY
                    Neil..?

      PRICE looks up in the mirror. He sees the gun. 

                                  PRICE
                    Put that back.

      NEIL turns to look. His face falls. He stares at PRICE.

                                  NEIL
                    Who the hell are you? 

      PRICE reaches over to Cathy for his bag.

                                  PRICE
                    Give me that.

    He tries to wrench the bag from her grasp and she screams.

                                  NEIL
                    Leave her alone.

                                  PRICE
                    Just drive.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

        CONTINUED:137137

      NEIL tries to pull him back but PRICE knocks him away. They 
      spin wildly across the road. PRICE grabs his bag. Money 
      falls out all over the front seats. NEIL stares at it.

                                  NEIL
                    Get out of the car...

    He tries to slow down but PRICE grabs the wheel with one 
      hand while gripping his throat with the other. The car 
      veers dangerously but PRICE is icy calm.

                                  PRICE
                    Just drive the car and we ll 
                    pretend this never happened. 

                                  NEIL
                    Okay... okay...

      PRICE increases the pressure on Neil s throat for a second 
      before finally letting him go. But as he relaxes his grip 
    he turns to see that the terrified CATHY is now holding a 
    can of de-icer.She squirts it full in his face. 

    He yells in agony and puts his hand over his eyes. NEIL 
      sees his chance. He springs the seat belt then leans across 
    and flings open the passenger door. As the car swings 
      crazily across the lanes, he pushes hard at the temporarily 
      blinded PRICE, sending him flying out of the door.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. ROAD. DAY 6. 12.37138138

      PRICE hurtles out of the speeding car and hits the tarmac 
      with a sickening thump. He rolls over and over and finally 
      lies still. He tries to pull himself up but then falls 
      back, unconscious or dead, as Neil speeds away. 

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. ROAD/PETROL STATION. DAY 6.  12.37139139

      GREG and ABBY see a petrol station ahead. GREG points to 
    it. 

                                  GREG
                    There might be something we can 
                    use...

    As he gets nearer he sees there is a van parked up by the 
      pumps with a man nearby. He smiles wryly.

                                  GREG
                    There s always a bloody queue.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      ABBY smiles in excitement and is already opening the door 
    and  hurrying towards the forecourtwaving at the VAN 
      DRIVER. 

                                  ABBY
                    Hi...

    We STAY ON GREG. Only now does he see the MAN is using a 
      battery powered pump to extract petrol from the storage 
      tanks 30 feet below the surface. The doors of his van are 
      open, and he is storing huge plastic bottles of fuel in the 
      back. He instantly hurls open his door to follow Abby.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. ROAD/PETROL STATION. DAY 6. 12.38140140

      ABBY hurries onto the forecourt.The MAN backs away, 
      looking protectively at his van.

                                  MAN
                    Back off. This is my petrol.

                                  ABBY
                    Where have you come from? Have 
                    you met anyone else?

    She goes towards him, open and friendly. But the man 
      shrinks back. 

                                  MAN
                    You can have your turn later.

                                  ABBY
                    What?

                                  MAN
                    I was here first...

                                  ABBY
                    You don t understand... 

                                  MAN
                    Get lost.

      ABBY stops in confusion.

                                  ABBY
                    Why are you being like this..?

      Before the man can reply GREG barrels onto the forecourt, 
      shouting desperately.

                    The pump... turn off the pump.

    He points at the pump, which chugs noisily, blue smoke 
      rising from its motor. Petrol leaks where the hose isn t 
      tightly screwed on. 

                                  GREG
                    It s sparking! For God s sake 
                    turn it off! 

    The MAN glances at it but is clearly more suspicious of 
      Greg. 

                                  MAN
                    Keep away...

                                  GREG
                    I don t want your bloody 
                    petrol...

      GREG crashes into ABBY, pushing her to the ground. She 
      cries out in shock but then seconds later a spark catches 
    and a sheet of flame engulfs the van. The man disappears in 
      a billowing wall of fire. GREG shields Abby and covers his 
      head as the ferocious heat sucks the oxygen from the air 
    all around him. 

    As the initial explosion dies down GREG looks up 
      cautiously. Fire sweeps across the forecourtand the van is 
      a charred wreck. The MAN has disappeared completely, 
      evaporated in an instant. GREG realisesit is only a matter 
    of seconds before the blaze reaches the storage tanks. He 
      gets to his feet, grabs ABBY and runs.

                                  GREG
                    It s going to blow.

      Reeling with shock and confusion she rushes after him 
      towards the car.

      INT. GREG S CAR. DAY 6.  12.38141141

      GREG hurls the car around the corner. Suddenly there is a 
      percussive whoosh and a sound like thunder. ABBY looks 
      behind them in shock. A huge black cloud of oily smoke 
      rises as the petrol station disappears in the massive 
      explosion.

      GREG stops the car, breathing heavily, well aware of how 
      close they came to disaster. They stare at each other in 
      shock. ABBY is distraught.

                                  ABBY
                    Why would he behave like that? 

      GREG looks at her, but has no easy answer.

                                  ABBY
                    We were only trying to help him.

                                  GREG
                    Welcome to the new world.

    AL drives the most boring, small car imaginable up to the 
      entrance of a service station. The doors stand open.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      emerges from the cafe carrying a tray loaded with muffins, 
      crisps and sweets. 

                                  NAJID
                    There s loads of stuff here.

                    You can t live on crisps. You 
                    need fruit and vegetables. Stuff 
                    like that.

                                  NAJID
                    Some of the fruit s still okay. 
                    (Pause) We can hang out here for 
                    a while then go to Blackburn to 
                    look for my cousins.

    AL ignores him as he takes a muffin from his tray.

                                  AL
                    I ll go across to the travel inn 
                    and get us some blankets. You 
                    stay here. There might be bodies. 

                                  NAJID
                    I ve seen bodies. Loads of them.

                    Then you don t need to see 
                    anymore.

      NAJID shrugs and wedges half a muffin in his mouth.

                                  NAJID
                    I m going down to the road to see 
                    if anyone is coming.

                                  AL
                    Don t get run over.

    He grins as he heads for the travel lodge.

      a hill she sees a body in the road. She hesitates, but then 
      sees him move. She rushes down the verge and into the road 
      towards him.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      PRICE is still conscious. He is badly knocked about, he 
      tries to say something but only groans. He lifts his hand 
      towards her but she stops him quickly.

                                  ANYA
                    Don t try to move.

    She feels his neck and head.

                    Breathe for me, try to relax.

    He does as he is told. She nods approvingly, brisk and 
      professional. She touches his foot.

                    Can you feel this?

      PRICE comes round slowly. He is lying on a sleeping bag at 
    the side of the road. ANYA is cleaning the cuts on his 
      face, using cotton wool and a half bottle of vodka. He 
      flinches as the alcohol stings his cuts. She smiles then 
      sits back and takes a cigarette from the packet in her bag.

                                  PRICE
                    You shouldn t smoke. It s bad for

                    So I m told. 

    She smiles, more glad than she knew to have company. She 
      lights the cigarette. She offers it to him but he shakes 
    his head. 

                                  ANYA
                    You ve cracked a couple of ribs

                    are no internal injuries. (Pause)

    She guesses there is more to it than this, but then shrugs 
    and goes back to her cigarette.

      ANYA looks up as a car appears in the distance. As it draws 
      closer it slows and then swings into the lay-by. GREG and 
      ABBY get out. They nod, a little wary. GREG looks at PRICE. 

                                  GREG
                    What s wrong with him?

                                  ANYA
                    He had an accident. I can t move 
                    him on my own. 

      GREG looks at ABBY and she nods her agreement instantly.

                                  GREG
                    You re welcome to travel with us

                    You ll be okay now. 

      PRICE stares at her. His face is badly swollen but his eyes 
      glint with their customary sharp intelligence.

    She offers him her hand and he sits up painfully. With her 
    and Greg helping, he hauls himself to his feet.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. MOTORWAY. DAY 6.  13.35148148

      NAJID stands in the fast lane playing football. He flicks 
    the ball up and juggles it. The sight of the little boy 
      playing in the motorway is strange and unsettling. AL 
      appears.

                                  AL
                    What did I tell you about playing 
                    football in the road.

      NAJID grins and kicks the ball towards him. AL traps it and 
      smiles.

                                  AL
                    Oh, what the hell.

    He kicks it back. NAJID rushes after it, then stops as they 
      suddenly hear cars in the distance.

                                  NAJID
                    Al!

    He points at the approaching vehicles. AL gestures to him.

                                  AL
                    Come here. 

      NAJID does as he is told. They look on uncertainly as the 
    car gets nearer. When they stop, GREG, ABBY and ANYA get 
      out. PRICE sits in the back seat.

      There is a second as they all look at each other. ABBY 
      smiles at NAJID.

                                  ABBY
                    Hello.

    He shrugs, suddenly shy.

                    Hi.

      There is an awkward moment. She smiles warmly. 

                                  ABBY
                    It s so good to see you.

                                  ABBY
                          (Shakes her head)
                    There are so few of us left, 
                    every new person feels like a 
                    gift.

    For a second NAJID hesitates but then suddenly all his pent-
    up loneliness and misery overwhelm him. He runs to her and 
      flings his arms around her neck, holding her desperately. 
    She hugs him back, tightly. 

      When she looks up at GREG there are tears in her eyes. 
      There is a moment, then GREG looks at AL.

                                  GREG
                    Where are you headed?

                    I thought I d check out what s 
                    happening in London.

                                  GREG
                    I wouldn t if I were you.

    AL looks at him inquiringly. GREG jerks his head over his 
      shoulder back towards the city.

                                  GREG
                    You think back there was bad? 
                    Wait until you see London. 
                    (Pause) If someone was still in 
                    control we d know by now.

                                  AL
                    There must be something left.

                                  GREG
                    Just a few people like us. 

      Everyone looks at him soberly. They know he is right. 

                                  AL
                    So what do we do?

      GREG shrugs. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  GREG
                    That s up to you. (Pause, to 
                    Abby) I reckon this is the end of 
                    the line for me. 

                                  ABBY
                    What do you mean?

                                  GREG
                    I ve got things to do. You ll be 
                    okay now.

      ABBY looks at him in shock.

                                  ABBY
                    You re just going to walk out?

                                  GREG
                    I told you. I m going to find a 
                    place of my own. 

      ANYA nods her head in agreement.

                                  ANYA
                    Me too. Once Tom s okay.

    She gestures at Price. AL shrugs.

                                  AL
                    I might as well push off as well. 
                    I can t play nanny for much 
                    longer.

      NAJID looks at him bitterly. 

                                  NAJID
                    I didn t want you lurking around 
                    me anyway.

      ABBY stares at them all in angry dismay.

                                  ABBY
                    Are you all completely crazy?

      They gaze at her in surprise.

                                  ABBY
                    You can t just... go.

                                  GREG
                    Why not?

                                  ABBY
                    Because we ve only just found 
                    each other. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  GREG
                    We don t know each other. We ve 
                    got nothing in common.

                                  ABBY
                    We survived! Isn t that 
                    something? 

      GREG looks at her uncertainly. The others glance at each 
      other, startled by her clarity. TOM PRICE climbs awkwardly 
      from his seat and leans against the car as ABBY stares 
      bitterly at GREG.

                                  ABBY
                    You told me I should make a fresh 
                    start. How can any of us do that 
                    on our own? 

                                  GREG
                    I also told you I had plans...

                                  ABBY
                    Well they can bloody well wait! 
                    This is more important. (Pause) 
                    Everything we ever knew has been 
                    ripped away from us. Our old life 
                    is dead. Now we have to build a 
                    new one. And we can t do it 
                    alone. (Pause, to  Greg) You 
                    can t go. None of us can.

    No one is more surprised by her passion than Abby herself, 
    but the more she talks the more certain she is. She looks 
      around at them, finding an inner strength and will she 
      never knew she possessed.

                                  ABBY
                    There s only one choice. We stand 
                    together or die. 

      There is a long silence, then AL whistles in appreciation.

                                  AL
                    I m going where she s going. 

                                  PRICE
                          (After a second)
                    I m in. 

      They all look at him in surprise. He smiles through cracked 
      lips.

                                  PRICE
                    What else have we got going?

      NAJID looks at ABBY uncertainly.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    I m going to find my cousins. But 
                    I don t mind hanging around for a 
                    bit.

      ABBY smiles at him and he looks down shyly. ANYA shrugs.

                                  ANYA
                    Why not?

    All eyes turn to GREG. ABBY looks at him fiercely.

                                  GREG
                          (Finally)
                    All right. Just until you get 
                    settled. Then I m away. 

      Abby smiles. The others smile too, optimism spreading 
      amongst them like an unfamiliar and welcome guest. They are 
    an odd, mismatched crowd, but at least they are not alone. 
      GREG smiles and looks at ABBY.

                                  GREG
                    All right, boss. What do we do 
                    now?

      ABBY stares at him in surprise, suddenly aware that all of 
      them are looking at her expectantly. She gazes out 
      uncertainly at the empty landscape. HOLD on a last image of 
      this isolated beauty, then -

      INT. WHITAKER S ROOM. DAY 6.  15.01150150

    The room is warmly lit and well appointed. There are prints 
    on the wall, a TV screen in one corner, a working computer 
    and comfortable chairs. There are no windows. WHITAKER sits 
      listening to music on his headphones. He is in his 40s, a 
      good-looking man with greying hair. He hums placidly. 

      There is a knock at the half-open door but only when the 
      visitor comes in does WHITAKER see him. He takes off his 
      headphones apologetically.

                                  WHITAKER
                    I m sorry, James. I didn t hear 
                    you.

    His visitor, JAMES HUTCHINGS, is in his 20s.He wears a 
      white lab coat over his jeans and sweater. 

                                  WHITAKER
                    Is everyone waiting?

                                  HUTCHINGS
                    It s quite all right, sir. 
                    There s no rush.

      WHITAKER takes his own white coat off the back of a chair.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. CORRIDOR. DAY 6.  15.02151151

    The corridor has a sterile feel. WHITAKER and HUTCHINGS 
      walk side by side.

                                  WHITAKER
                    Strange to imagine what s been 
                    happening out there. Hard to 
                    grasp the enormity of it.

                                  HUTCHINGS
                    I don t like to think about it.

      WHITAKER glances at him.

                                  WHITAKER
                    Who did you have on the outside? 
                    Parents, wasn t it?

                                  HUTCHINGS
                    And my sister. 

                                  WHITAKER
                    I m sorry. (Pause) We ve all 
                    sacrificed so much. You never 
                    told them anything?

                                  HUTCHINGS
                    No, sir. 

                                  WHITAKER
                    That must have been hard.

      HUTCHINGS nods uneasily, then leads the way into a room.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. LAB. DAY 6.  15.03152152

      They turn into a big room, fully equipped with the latest 
      hi-tech laboratory equipment. A few WORKERS, also in white 
      coats, pore over computers. There is the same sterile glow 
      from the harsh white lighting. There is something oddly 
      normal about the this hermetically sealed environment and 
    at the same time jarringly strange. 

      WHITAKER looks around, then turns to HUTCHINGS with a 
      smile.

                                  WHITAKER
                    Well, James. (Pause) I think it s 
                    time to begin.

      HOLD on his face for a second, then -
