A neat, well-appointed flat, tastefully decorated. Framed
against a large window which looks out over the city, an
elegant woman in her 70's: EVELYN GREENSLADE. She's on the
phone, on hold.
On the desk in front of her is a brand new laptop computer;
the screen reads 'Getting Started ...'
AUTOMATED VOICE
(ON PHONE)
Thank you for your patience.
Your call is important to us. We
will be with you shortly.
Evelyn's patience is strained nonetheless. She taps her
fingers on the desk.
AUTOMATED VOICE (cont'd)
(ON PHONE)
Thank you for your patience.
Your call is -
A slightly-accented voice finally interrupts.
FEMALE VOICE
Mrs Greenslade, thank you for
WAITING -
EVELYN
(OVERLAPPING)
Yes, now if you could stay on the
phone for a moment and talk to
me, just talk to me. I'm not
even clear, I don't actually
understand what it is I'm trying
to order. Is wireless the same
as wi-fi? And what do either of
them have to do with broadband?
FEMALE VOICE
Mrs Greenslade, since the account
is not in your name, before we
can make any changes we need to
speak to the account holder. Can
I please talk to the account
holder?
EVELYN
What?
FEMALE VOICE
I'm asking if I can speak to the
account holder. Before we can
make any changes -
EVELYN
You can't talk to him, no.
(BEAT)
He's dead. He died. There's
only me.
GILES, a judge in full wig and robes, moves quickly down a
corridor. He passes other judges, going the opposite way.
He arrives at the office of GRAHAM DASHWOOD, goes in.
GRAHAM is at his desk. His robes are on a hanger, his wig
is on a stand beside him.
GILES
We're late.
Moments later. Graham and Giles walk down the corridor.
GRAHAM
Bloody retirement parties. Hard
cheese, soft wine, and endless
speeches. Why do people do that?
No one ever said about any kind
of party: it was a wonderful
occasion, just a shame that the
speeches were so short.
GILES
it'll be you one day.
GRAHAM
One day very soon.
GILES
You've been saying that for
years.
They walk into a large room, full of lawyers.
At one end of the hall, a very old JUDGE is giving a very
dull speech.
3.
JUDGE
An occasion such as this leads
one to cast ones mind back to the
days when I first entered my
pupillage. I had the very good
fortune of serving as a junior to
Mr Justice Stancombe
Graham's not listening any more. He's looking around the
room. At the old, tired faces.
JUDGE (CONT'D)
. the unwelcome news that I
would transfer Chambers, bringing
to mind the old adage a fronte
praecipitium, a tergo 1upi
Everything seems to slow down, the judge's mouth moving
more and more sluggishly, though his voice remains the
same. The effect is strange .. then the sound of laughter.
GRAHAM
This is the day.
Everyone looks round at him. He's almost as surprised as
they are that he's spoken out loud.
GILES
Graham?
GRAHAM
This is the day.
He turns and walks out.
Staff bustle around a busy A & E ward. MURIEL lies on a
bed in the corridor.
The Head Nurse, KAREN, rushes past.
MURIEL
Listen, young lady. I want a cup
of tea, and I want it now.
KAREN
The trolley will be along
shortly.
MURIEL
How hard d'you have to fall down
before you get some proper
attention? Hours I've been lying
here, and not a single doctor has
come to see me.
3A.
KAREN
Now that's not quite true, is it
Mrs Donnelly?
(MORE)
4.
KAREN (CONT'D)
A doctor did try and examine you,
and you sent him away.
MURIEL
That one?
She looks up to the far end of the ward, where a doctor is
washing his hands. He's black.
MURIEL
He can wash all he likes, that
colour's not coming out. I want
an English doctor.
KAREN
An English doctor? Why didn't
you say so? I'll get one right
away.
She goes away, comes back moments later with a tall,
handsome doctor. The bad news for Muriel is
KAREN (CONT'D)
This is Dr Ghujarapartidar. And
this is Mrs Donnelly.
A young estate agent, EVAN, is showing DOUGLAS and JEAN
around a very small, and very beige bungalow.
EVAN
So as I say, what you're looking
at here is very competitively
priced, you can't get better
value for your grey pound.
Another little feature, not
necessary right now, but give it
a couple of years
(POINTS)
. rails on the walls to help
you get around, and down here, a
panic button in case of a sudden
fall, brings the Warden running.
4A.
JEAN
What if we fell somewhere else?
EVAN
Sorry?
JEAN
It's just that we might not
manage to plan our sudden fall in
the exact corner where the button
is.
EVAN
Yeah. As I say -
5.
JEAN
And would it be possible to get
the rail to go through the middle
of the room as well?
DOUGLAS
DARLING
JEAN
To help us get across, not just
around?
DOUGLAS
(TO EVAN)
Could we have a moment, please?
Thanks. Thanks so much.
Evan goes.
JEAN
Thirty years in the Civil Service
and this is all we can afford?
DOUGLAS
Would it help if I apologized
again?
JEAN
No. But try it anyway.
JUDITH (40ish) is sitting opposite someone. We don't see
whom.
JUDITH
And then after that I worked as a
systems analyst for a few years
but I just found it so dull, what
I really wanted was to do
something that was more creative,
that matched my ...
(BEAT)
I'm sorry. On the form they
asked for our age bracket, and
the age we wanted to meet . and
in both cases I ticked 35-45.
Now we see the man she's talking to. It's NORMAN. He's
dapper, nice looking. And at least 70.
NORMAN
That's right, yes. So did I.
They're at a speed dating evening. Numbered tables, etc.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Anyway, don't stop. Something
MORE CREATIVE
6.
JUDITH
How old are you?
NORMAN
Early 40's.
JUDITH
D'you mean you were born in the
early 40's?
NORMAN
Judy, I know what you're asking -
JUDITH
It's Judith.
NORMAN
Judith. And trust me, I've still
got it.
The bell goes; the signal for the women to get up and move
along to the next table. Judith leaves without looking
back.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
I just can't find anyone that
wants it.
Another hopeful candidate arrives opposite Norman. And
looks crestfallen at what's on offer.
MADGE is in her bedroom. She's arguing with her son-in-law
CRAIG. Madge's suitcases are by the door.
CRAIG
This is crazy. You're crazy.
You can't just up and leave like
this.
MADGE
And yet if you watch me, that's
exactly what you'll see happen.
She picks up her suitcases, heads out of the room. Madge's
daughter JESSICA is on the landing.
JESSICA
What's going on?
CRAIG
Your mother's lost it.
JESSICA
My mother never had it.
7.
CRAIG
Talk to her. She doesn't listen
to me.
MADGE
Nobody listens to you.
She heads down the stairs. Craig and Jessica follow.
MADGE (CONT'D)
(TO JESSICA)
It's one of the great mysteries
of life that someone so vibrant
and fascinating as my daughter
should choose to spend her life
with this fraction of a man.
JESSICA
I still don't understand what's
going on.
CRAIG
I just asked her to babysit. And
now she says she's leaving.
They're at the bottom of the stairs. Jessica's children,
LIAM and KATIE, are watching.
JESSICA
But you love babysitting.
MADGE
I loved it last night.
LIAM
We had pizza and stayed up late.
MADGE
And the night before.
KATIE
We had Chinese and stayed up
late.
LIAM
If you don't go, tonight we could
do a curry.
MADGE
It's tempting, my darlings, but
you know why I must leave.
LIAM
We know.
KATIE
(to her parents)
Being here is stopping her
finding a husband.
8.
CRAIG
Another one?
LIAM AND KATIE
Bye Granny.
MADGE
Don't let the buggers get you
down.
Madge turns to go.
CRAIG
How many husbands have you had,
anyway?
She turns back, smiles.
MADGE
Including my own?
Then she's out of the front door, and heading for the taxi.
JESSICA
Mother? Mother!
Moments later. Madge climbs into the back of the cab.
TAXI DRIVER
Name the place, darling. Where
are you going?
Madge smiles.
MADGE
I have absolutely no idea.
Evelyn, whom we saw earlier on the phone, is in the living
room. Her son CHRISTOPHER is there. And her lawyer
HAROLD.
CHRISTOPHER
There's no other way There
just isn't. Harold told us this
three months ago.
HAROLD
And I'm afraid matters have only
got worse.
8A.
CHRISTOPHER
We can't wait any longer. We
need to put this flat on the
market, and at least make a start
at paying off Dad's debts.
9.
Christopher turns to Harold.
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)
I've talked it through with Polly
and the boys, and of course we
all agreed. Ma will move in with
us.
HAROLD
I think that's best, Evelyn.
It's what Hugh would've wanted.
They wait for confirmation from Evelyn. None comes.
CHRISTOPHER
Good. Settled. End of
discussion.
EVELYN
That's what your father used to
say.
CHRISTOPHER
MA -
EVELYN
When there'd never really been
any discussion at all.
CHRISTOPHER
I want to look after things for
you.
EVELYN
Like he did for forty years
CHRISTOPHER
Yes.
EVELYN
And look how that turned out.
She turns to Harold
EVELYN (CONT'D)
How can any of us know what Hugh
would've wanted? And would he
have seen fit to tell us anyway?
(BEST)
Obviously the flat has to be
sold.
(Best, then to Christopher)
And you're very kind. And dear
Polly. But no, I won't be coming
to live with you.
9A.
Muriel has now been transferred to a ward. She is
listening to DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR.
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
You need a new hip, Mrs Donnelly.
It's not a difficult operation.
MURIEL
Easy for you to say, you're not
having it.
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
Regardless. You do need a new
hip.
MURIEL
I'm not getting it from you.
2nd Green Revisions I0/01/11 10.
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
Not me personally, no.
MURIEL
Not any of your lot.
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
I see.
MURIEL
So when do I have the operation?
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
I'm afraid you'll be on a waiting
list for at least six months.
MURIEL
At my age, I can't plan that far
ahead. I don't even buy green
bananas.
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
There is another way. Our
hospital trust is funding a new
pilot scheme, that will enable us
to out-source you to another
hospital, where they can perform
the procedure almost immediately,
and at a fraction of the cost.
MURIEL
Is it local?
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
That depends how you define
local.
Evelyn is on the phone to her son Christopher. They're
both sitting at computers. Evelyn's new-found dexterity is
impressive.
Around Evelyn's room are packing boxes, some already full.
CHRISTOPHER
(ON PHONE)
When did you get a computer?
EVELYN
How far along is the progress
bar? The strip at the bottom
that tells you -
CHRISTOPHER
I know what it is. What are you
showing me anyway?
11.
The webpage has come up. It's a picture of a beautiful old
building. And underneath is written 'THE BEST EXOTIC
MARIGOLD HOTEL'.
As Christopher gapes in horror, he hears a mellifluous
Indian voice.
INDIAN VOICE
'Come and spend your autumn years
in an Indian palace with the
sophistication of an English
country manor. Steeped in the
tradition of the Raj, tucked away
on the outskirts of Jaipur .'
The mellifluous tones continue. Madge mouths the words to
herself as she scans the same web-page.
INDIAN VOICE
it exudes historical
ambience and is graced with
breathtaking surroundings .'
Jean whom we earlier saw looking at the bungalow, is at
the hairdressers. Her stylist ABI listens to her reading a
computer printout for the same hotel. Which looks classy,
elegant, and welcoming.
Madge's voice bleeds into Jean's.
JEAN
(READING)
'Lofty terraces, open courtyards,
domes, arches and canopied
balconies transport one back in
time.'
ABI
I wouldn't mind going there
myself.
Graham, the judge, is in his office. It's nearly empty;
his entire life is being packed away.
His friend Giles watches him put more things in boxes.
GILES
How long have we known each
other? And you've never once
talked about India.
GRAHAM
D'you want these books?
GILES
You might need them again.
Graham smiles at him, calls out.
GRAHAM
Mrs Megson!
His cleaner, MRS MEGSON, comes in.
MRS MEGSON
Sir?
Graham takes a beautiful vase off the shelf, gives it to
her.
GRAHAM
I want you to have this.
MRS MEGSON
Are you sure?
13.
GRAHAM
Absolutely. There's a slight
crack on the bottom. But I think
you might know something about
that already.
Mrs Megson goes.
GRAHAM (CONT'D)
I used to live there. A long
time ago.
A bedsit. Slightly down at heel, and sparsely furnished.
Norman, whom we met speed dating, is talking to someone.
We don't see who.
Quietly, in the background, Radio 2 music from an old
battery radio.
NORMAN
I have to go. I do. And I could
say I wish you'd come, but I've
never lied to you. We both know
I need more than you can offer.
We know that. Don't we?
We see who's sitting in front of him. An ancient
dachshund.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
(to the dog)
Don't make that face at me.
Norman's Polish landlady, MRS JELLINEK, is at the door.
MRS JELLINEK
(to her dog)
You. Upstairs.
The dog hops off the chair, and leaves. Norman watches him
go.
MRS JELLINEK (cont'd)
Any warm clothes you have use for
no more, I take them. And not
forget to leave keys when you go.
She leaves. Norman is left alone.
NORMAN
I'll miss you too.
14.
Madge is at the First Class Check-In desk.
MADGE
And the connecting flight to
Jaipur is first class too?
The check-in girl nods, hands Madge back her passport.
MADGE (CONT'D)
I tell you, it's tough to get
upgraded nowadays. I had to
flirt so hard with the travel
agent, it was practically phone
sex.
The light is fading.
15A.
Norman appears to be relishing a detailed search from a
female Security Guard.
NORMAN
Come on. Thorough as you like
Muriel is waiting to collect her bag from the belt.
SECURITY GUARD
We'd like to take a look in this
bag, Madam, if you don't mind.
He lifts the bag onto a table. It's heavier than he
thought.
16.
SECURITY GUARD (cont'd)
What you got in here anyway?
He opens the bag, stares in astonishment.
MURIEL
PG Tips. Brown sauce. Ten jars
of Marmite. Thirty one packets
of Chocolate Hobnobs. Pickled
onions. Pickled eggs. And
pickle.
SECURITY GUARD
No liquids on the plane.
MURIEL
What does that mean?
SECURITY GUARD
It means you can't take the
pickled onions. Or the pickled
eggs.
(BEAT)
The pickle's fine.
The passengers from Flight 1045 to Delhi are seated at the
gate, waiting to board.
Muriel is wheeled up by an attendant and parked at the end
of the only remaining row of empty chairs. Douglas and
Jean are already sitting there.
Jean smiles politely as Graham sits down a couple of seats
away.
Norman arrives, carrying his battery radio, sees an empty
place between Jean and Madge, who is sitting at the end.
He smiles knowingly at Madge as he sits.
Finally Evelyn takes the only available space, between
Graham and Douglas.
And there the seven passengers wait patiently, unaware of
their common fate.
The sound of a jet engine, quiet at first, finally engulfs
them.
Evelyn, Douglas, Jean and Graham are descending on an
escalator. Madge is a few steps up.
JEAN
Obviously one's read one's
Kipling, but we view this as an
opportunity to explore another
culture, as well as making new
friends. And a retired judge is
just the class of guest one was
hoping for, isn't it Douglas?
DOUGLAS
I'm sorry?
GRAHAM
(TO EVELYN)
And is this your first time in
India?
JEAN
You don't seem like an
experienced traveller.
EVELYN
I'm not. Although one has read
one's guidebooks.
Jean blinks. Evelyn and Graham share a smile. Douglas
hides his. And Madge sees it all.
As they head towards the baggage carousel, they're met by
Muriel and Norman, emerging from the elevator. Norman is
pushing Muriel's wheelchair.
NORMAN
Norman Cousins.
MADGE
Madge Hardcastle. A pleasure.
NORMAN
Play your cards right, it could
be.
Madge stares at him. A voice comes over the tannoy.
AIRPORT ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, we regret
to inform you that owing to bad
weather, Flight 105 to Jaipur has
been cancelled. The airline is
happy to arrange
CUT TO:
18.
Hours later. The airport is deserted, except for the
Marigold Hotel party, who sit slumped and exhausted on
another row of seats, with Muriel's wheelchair at the other
end.
After a moment, Graham says
GRAHAM
Alright. Plan B.
Moments later. They're all moving briskly through the hi-
tech, ultra-modern, beautifully air-conditioned building.
JEAN
Of course it's a good idea. Who
can you trust if not a High Court
Judge?
DOUGLAS
And this way we see more of the
country.
Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair.
NORMAN
(leaning down, to
MURIEL)
If anyone asks, say you're my
mother. I don't want people to
think we're together.
MURIEL
In your dirty dreams.
JEAN
Douglas, these are not words that
often pass my lips, but you may
actually be right. The country
seems to be rather more civilised
than one originally thought.
Norman is grinning from ear to ear.
20.
NORMAN
I'm loving this!
Evelyn is sitting next to Madge.
EVELYN
A few months ago I was organising
the church flowers.
MADGE
Are you struggling with the
feeling you're not in control of
your circumstances?
EVELYN
A little.
MADGE
You know what the shortest prayer
in the world is?
EVELYN
No.
MADGE
Fuck it.
Evelyn laughs.
MADGE (CONT'D)
You're not doing the church
flowers any more. May as well
enjoy the ride.
Douglas is watching a nice Indian family. They're having a
picnic. The father notices Douglas looking, offers him
some food.
Douglas makes the namaste gesture, takes some happily.
JEAN
Are you insane? "Avoid all food
not from a reputable vendor, it
will have been washed with impure
water."
Douglas keeps eating, with great enjoyment.
DOUGLAS
It's just a sandwich.
JEAN
Marvellous. Then I'll have the
ham, cheese, and streptococcus,
please. Or perhaps the bacteria,
lettuce and tomato.
Douglas turns to Muriel.
21.
DOUGLAS
Would you like some of this? I
believe it's aloo ka paratha.
MURIEL
If I can't pronounce it, I'm not
eating it.
The cacophony of horns continues. Jean screams, as another
collision looms.
Everyone is asleep, or trying to sleep.
Except Muriel. She reaches into her bag, and carefully
removes a biscuit. She surreptitiously lifts it to her
mouth, and starts to chew.
Madge has fallen asleep on Evelyn's shoulder. But Evelyn
is still awake, as is Graham.
EVELYN
How long since you were here?
GRAHAM
Forty years.
EVELYN
As long as I was married.
(BEAT)
He died recently. My husband.
GRAHAM
I'm sorry.
EVELYN
D'you think we're going to be
alright?
GRAHAM
God, don't ask me. I'm more
scared than you are.
They both smile, sit in silence for a bit.
GRAHAM (CONT'D)
Yes. I think it's going to be
extraordinary.
22.
The courtyard is not without charm, although somewhat
delapidated. A fountain at the centre does not look as if
it has seen water in years, and faded awnings are strung up
haphazardly.
Sonny is leading Madge into the darkness of the building,
towards her room.
SONNY
This is a building of the utmost
character, which means that
perhaps not everything will
function in the way you expect it
to. But as the manager and chief
executive supervising officer of
the Marigold Hotel, I can tell
you with great pride that the
building has stood for centuries,
and will stand for many more, in
100% shipshape condition. Please
follow me, carefully avoiding
that naughty stone there
round this corner, leading us
most successfully all the way to
. your bedroom!
The room is very small, comfortable, and tastefully
decorated. But there's no door.
MADGE
Where?
SONNY
Here. In here.
MADGE
My dear man. Rooms have doors.
What you're showing me here is an
alcove.
SONNY
The door is coming soon, most
definitely.
MADGE
How soon?
24.
SONNY
Let us not concern ourselves with
details, Mrs Hardcastle. Rather
than speaking of doors, we should
instead take pleasure in the
freedom to roam.
MADGE
Does your room have a door?
SONNY
Oh yes.
MADGE
Then that's where I'll be
staying.
Evelyn arrives at her room, goes on in.
The room is light and airy. And rather nice. But all the
furniture is covered in sheets.
As Evelyn stands there, Sonny comes rushing in, yanks all
the sheets off, and runs out again.
Muriel wheels herself towards her room. Standing inside is
a male nurse, AJIT.
Muriel swivels her chair around. Graham is just going into
his room.
MURIEL
There's an Indian in there!
Graham smiles, goes on into his room. Which is dusty, but
comfortable and pleasant.
He looks around with satisfaction.
25.
Jean is confronting Sonny.
JEAN
I want to stay at the other
hotel, the one in the brochure.
SONNY
Mrs Ainslie, prepare to be
amazed. This is that very
building!
JEAN
You've Photoshopped it!
SONNY
I have offered a vision of the
future.
(MORE)
26.
SONNY (CONT'D)
Of course I had hoped that by now
it would be the present. But in
India we have a saying:
everything will be alright in the
end. So if it is not alright,
then it is not yet the end.
JEAN
What will start to make this
alright is for you to give us a
refund.
SONNY
Of course if that is what you
desire, you must have it.
Absolutely no problem, I will
refund you completely.
JEAN
You will? Straight away?
SONNY
Without question, Mrs Ainslie, I
most definitely will. Straight
away in three months.
Graham is taking some things out of his bag: an old map of
Jaipur, sepia-tinted photographs of a British family during
the Raj, official documents yellowing with age.
He picks up a photograph, looks at it.
From outside, we can hear Ajit, the physiotherapist
AJIT (O.S.)
a stay of five days and it is
done under general anaesthesia.
A hip replacement usually takes
only two hours
Douglas picks up the very old-style phone. Evelyn is
watching.
DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
Now, did you try jiggling it a
bit?
EVELYN
Yes, did that.
DOUGLAS
Did you kind of bang it lightly
on the desk a few times?
EVELYN
That too.
DOUGLAS
Hmm.
He twists off the mouthpiece of the receiver, lifts the
receiver carefully. And blows on it.
28.
EVELYN
How did you come to be here? In
India.
DOUGLAS
I invested our - well, my -
retirement money in our
daughter's internet company. She
assured me that as soon as the
start-up actually started up, and
the conversion from virtual to
actual proved sufficiently
viable, then she would be able to
pay it all back.
EVELYN
I'm not sure I understand what
most of those words mean.
DOUGLAS
It turns out neither did she.
Douglas has put the mouthpiece back on, holds the receiver
to his ear.
DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
There you are. Good as new.
EVELYN
Really?
DOUGLAS
No, of course not. I've got no
idea what I'm doing.
Evelyn bursts out laughing.
DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
Now, would you like me to not fix
that chair? Because I can do
that too.
Evelyn is typing - hunt and peck - at her computer. Beside
her, the classified pages of the local newspaper.
EVELYN (V.0.)
No longer do I reach out in the
morning for Radio 4. My news
comes instead from the Jaipur
HERALD
An office out of a Kafka novel; cloth bags containing files
are piled all around the room, floor to ceiling.
Graham is seated at a desk, in front of a sober official.
He is filling in a form.
EVELYN (V.0.)
Those who know the country of old
just go about their business.
But nothing can prepare the
uninitiated for this riot of
noise and colour ...
32.
The guests look on with trepidation, as another meal is
laid before them.
EVELYN (V.0.)
with the flow of exotic
dishes he demands daily from the
kitchen. Mooli Moong Dal.
Baghara Baingan. Banjari Gosht.
Paneer Methi Chaman ...
As the list unfolds, the guests, one by one, enter their
bathrooms; a litany of doors closing
Until Norman.
EVELYN (V.0.) (cont'd)
Mutton Vindaloo ...
Norman lies on his bed, reading the Kama Sutra.
He spins the book round, in order to study an illustration
more intently.
The hospital puts the NHS to shame. It's hi-tech, bright,
and spanking clean.
33.
Sonny pushes Muriel through the doors of the lobby. The
reception area is a forest of dark skin. Muriel is rigid
with fear.
EVELYN (V.0.)
Initially you're overwhelmed.
But gradually you realise: it's
like a wave. Resist, and you'll
be knocked over ...
Sonny is in discussion with some doctors.
Then he turns to see that Muriel has vanished. Through the
window Muriel can be seen frantically wheeling herself away
down the path...
EVELYN (V.0.) (cont'd)
Dive into it, and you'll swim out
the other side.
Madge is exchanging some coins with a street trader in
return for a mobile phone.
In her room, Madge scans a phone directory, and dials a
number.
EVELYN (V.0.)
This is a new and different
world.
Evelyn is finishing her blog. She picks up the paper,
checks something.
EVELYN (V.0.)
The challenge is to cope with it.
Douglas is getting ready to go out. Jean clearly isn't.
DOUGLAS
Graham was talking about this
marvellous temple. I thought you
might want to come with me.
JEAN
I'm your wife. Have we met?
DOUGLAS
You'd really rather stay here all
day?
JEAN
Given the alternative, yes.
DOUGLAS
When I walk out in the morning,
the street kids all smile at me.
JEAN
Because you give them money.
DOUGLAS
One does this trick where he
holds his hands out in front of
himself, and then swings through
his own arms. Got to be worth a
rupee or two.

DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
I'll go on my own then.
35.
Ajit is wheeling Muriel through the hospital.
MURIEL
When can I go back to England?
AJIT
As soon as you can walk onto the
plane. How does the hip feel?
MURIEL
They must have got lucky.
AJIT
It's strange. I think the more
operations they perform, the
luckier they get.
He glances down at Muriel, who betrays no signof getting
Ajit's joke.
A brightly-lit open plan office on a high floor of the
building. The city sprawls magnificently below.
Partitions divide off the cubicles. Within them sit rows
of workers, all early 20's, all with headsets clamped to
their ears. As chaotic as the streets of Jaipur are, this
place is immaculate, controlled and efficient.
We hear snatches of what they're saying.
TELEMARKETERS
Thank you for talking to us today
We do appreciate your call
while I have you on the
phone, can I talk to you about
our special offers . your call
is important to us . now is
there anything else I can help
you with ... shouldn't take more
than five minutes . your custom
is valuable to us
(MORE)
39A.
TELEMARRETERS (CONT'D)
I'm afraid I'll have to refer
that to my supervisor just a
routine security check before we
start . Thank you for talking
to us today
Through a glass partition, Evelyn can be seen sitting at a
desk, talking to someone.
40.
JAY (late 20's) is talking to Evelyn.
JAY
You're sure I can't offer you
something? We have English
Breakfast Tea. Building Tea, as
you call it.
EVELYN
Builder's tea. It's called
builder's tea. And no, I'm fine.
Thank you.
JAY
Tell me then. How can I help
you?
Beat.
EVELYN
I don't think you can. I'm
sorry, I shouldn't have come.
She stands.
JAY
WAIT -
EVELYN
I saw your advertisement in the
local paper, and it specifically
mentioned the ability to talk to
older people. But this is not
what I imagined ...
JAY
You came for a job?
EVELYN
I've wasted your time.
JAY
Mrs Greenslade. Everyone working
here is a graduate of a good
university. This is a place for
ambitious people. Young people.
EVELYN
I see that. Good day.
JAY
Please. One second.
Evelyn stops.
JAY (CONT'D)
It is really builder's tea?
41.
EVELYN
Yes. We dunk biscuits into it.
JAY
You dunk?
EVELYN
It means lowering a biscuit into
your tea, letting it soak in
there, then trying to calculate
the exact moment just before it
dissolves to whip it up to the
mouth, and enjoy the blissful
union of biscuit and tea
combined.
(BEAT)
It's more relaxing than it
sounds.
JAY
Perhaps you can help us after
all.
A few minutes later. From the open-plan office Evelyn can
be seen talking to Jay.
One person watching is SUNAINA (20's). She's talking on
the phone.
SUNAINA
We do appreciate your custom,
which is very important to us.
And can I draw your attention to
our special -
But the person at the other end has hung up. Sunaina
starts to dial another number.
Then the clock hits 11, and a buzzer sounds. Sunaina gets
up, heads for the door.
Moments later. Evelyn is sitting in front of Graham's
collage.
GRAHAM
I grew up here. Just a short
drive away. It was a big house,
and we had servants, everyone
did. We knew their wives, their
children. One boy, Manoj, became
my friend. We played a lot of
cricket together, played anything
we could. And that's how it
stayed for years. Until one
night, he became something more.
(BEAT)
We had a few months, we had that.
There was a weekend in Udaipur,
we sat by a lake and watched the
sun go down, and I remember
thinking . I will never be this
happy again. And I was right.
Because quite suddenly it was
over. We'd fallen asleep, and
they found us.
(MORE)
47.
GRAHAM (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
For me it was bad enough. But I
already knew who I was, and I
think my family had guessed. For
Manoj, the disgrace was absolute;
a double taboo. His father was
fired, they were sent away, all
of them. I don't know what I
could've done, but it should've
been more than nothing. I put up
no fight. I let it happen.
(BEAT)
Soon afterwards I went to
England, to University. I always
told myself I'd come back. But I
never did.
EVELYN
Until now.
GRAHAM
And now I think .. what if I am
the last person on earth he wants
to see?
Evelyn says nothing.
GRAHAM (CONT'D)
I don't think I can go through
with it.
EVELYN
Do you want to see him again?
GRAHAM
Yes. Yes. Oh yes.
EVELYN
Then you must.
From her wheelchair, Muriel is re-making her bed. She
tucks in a perfect hospital corner.
48.
She looks up. Anokhi is on the verandah, replacing her
untouched supper tray with breakfast. Anokhi is about to
leave, but stops.
Then she goes to fetch Muriel's jar of pickle from the
windowsill, and places it on the table.
Muriel watches, then wheels herself outside, looks at the
tray.
From outside, Sonny's voicecan be heard.
SONNY (O.S.)
And so now that we are fully
operational, Mr Maruthi, it is
clear that with a small injection
of funds for the Phase Two
Development ...
Moments later. Sonny closes the door behind him.
His mother starts going through the contents of his desk.
MRS KAPOOR
Who was that man out there?
SONNY
The contents of this desk are
mine. Don't open the drawers. I
must insist you don't open the
drawer.
Mrs Kapoor opens the drawer.
50.
SONNY (CONT'D)
Tell me why you have come.
MRS KAPOOR
Do I need a reason to visit my
favourite son?
SONNY
No. He is in his mansion in
Delhi.
MRS KAPOOR
My second favourite.
SONNY
He went to Kerala to make his
fortune.
MRS KAPOOR
But make it, he did.
SONNY
As I will make mine. I have a
dream, Mummyji. A most brilliant
one: to out-source old age. And
not just for the British. There
are many other countries where
they don't like old people too.
MRS KAPOOR
Your brothers own a third of the
hotel each, they are entitled to
a third of the profits.
SONNY
Success does not happen
overnight, Mummyji. This is blue
sky thinking, and it requires
long-term strategy and patience.
MRS KAPOOR
How is your girlfriend?
SONNY
I look forward to you meeting
her.
MRS KAPOOR
And I look forward to you meeting
the woman you will marry. She is
from a good family in Delhi.
SONNY
I can marry as I choose, Mummyji.
I need no permission.
MRS KAPOOR
I presume it is your girlfriend
who teaches you such nonsense.
One reason not to marry her.
51.
SONNY
What if I love her?
MRS KAPOOR
An even better reason. Now send
Young Wasim to the car for my
luggage.
SONNY
He cannot carry, he has a dicky
back ... wait, your luggage? How
long are you staying?
MRS KAPOOR
As long as it takes.
DAY
Jean is looking out of her bathroom window, down into the
courtyard.
She sees Graham come out of his room. She turns back to
the mirror, looks at herself.
Graham comes into the chaotic office.
The bookish official, MR CHIDAMBRAM, is behind the desk.
GRAHAM
Good morning.
MR CHIDAMBRAM
Good morning, Sir. Did I not say
that we will contact you when
there is information regarding
your inquiry?
GRAHAM
Yes, you did say that. You did.
54.
MR CHIDAMBRAM
While it is most pleasant to see
you, your presence does not
actually accelerate our
investigation.
GRAHAM
I'll try not to come in tomorrow.
MR CHIDAMBRAM
I expect I will see you then.
None of the operators are on the phone. Instead they are
sitting in a semi-circle, looking curiously at Evelyn. Who
is sitting next to Jay, a little daunted by the attention.
EVELYN
.You ring in the morning.
Let's assume the person answering
will be a woman. She will have
had her breakfast. Tea or
coffee. Semi-skimmed milk,
always. If she's under 50 she'll
be contemplating yet another
diet, over 50 she'll have more or
less given up, and be eating
toast. The radio may be playing,
or more likely daytime TV. A
chat show, or a programme with a
moderator speaking to a panel of
young women whose boyfriends have
all slept with their mothers.
The girlfriends' mothers, I mean,
not their own. Although
Anyway, then the boyfriends
usually come out, and everybody
fights.
Sunaina is in the audience. She calls out.
SUNAINA
I'm not surprised people hang up
on us.
Laughter.
EVELYN
That's the point. When the phone
rings and it's this robot
nobody wants a machine, but it's
almost worse when it's a person
behaving like one. All these
sales cliches just strung
together. 'Your call is
important to us'. Is it? Well
then sound like it.
55.
SUNAINA
'Your custom is valuable'.
EVELYN
Right. That one. Don't ever say
that.
SUNAINA
'Service is our middle name'.
EVELYN
Yes, when your middle name is
ACTUALLY
SUNAINA
Shantanu.
EVELYN
Which is beautiful. You people
are young, vibrant, real. I'm
sure the typical housewife would
enjoy talking to each and every
one of you.
SUNAINA
Her morning sounds like fun.
What are you doing here?
Beat.
EVELYN
I suppose I'm not typical
anymore.
(TO JAY)
Is that the sort of thing?
Madge is at her mirror, doing her make-up with great care.
She looks beautiful.
Madge and Norman are sitting together. Norman is looking
across at the bar, where an attractive older ex-pat lady is
sitting, thus far resisting Norman's attempts to catch her
eye.
NORMAN
I still think you're cramping my
style.
MADGE
Please. You have no style to
cramp.
58A.
NORMAN
That lady at the bar keeps
looking at me.
MADGE
As one would something in a
museum.
NORMAN
Why must you mock? I just want
to feel young again, to be needed
as much as I need, if only for
one night, one wonderful night.
Tell me you don't know how that
feels.
59.
Silence for a bit.
MADGE
Give me a minute. Then join us.
She gets up, heads towards the bar. Where she sits a
couple of seats away from the woman. Who is called CAROL.
She sits there a moment, then sighs, and starts to talk to
the barman.
MADGE (CONT'D)
Rejected again. Many years ago,
that man over there gave me the
most extraordinary night of my
life. He may seem coarse and
uncouth, but that only disguises
a tenderness and an exquisite
sensitivity to a woman's needs
Norman arrives at the bar.
NORMAN
Those drinks not ready yet?
Madge turns to Carol.
MADGE
They say patience is passion
tamed.
Carol smiles.
MADGE (CONT'D)
I'm Madge.
CAROL
Carol.
MADGE
And this . is Norman.
CAROL
How do you do?
NORMAN
Carol? As in Christmas?
Madge winces.
CAROL
I suppose.
NORMAN
Great.
Silence.
60.
MADGE
So what brings you to Jaipur,
Carol?
NORMAN
Yes, Carol. What brings you to
Jaipur?
CAROL
I run a small boutique travel
agency. But I've actually lived
here all my life. My father
worked in the Foreign Office.
Another silence.
NORMAN
You're very fit.
CAROL
I beg your pardon?
MADGE
Oh god.
NORMAN
I mean you look like you keep
yourself in shape. Physically.
CAROL
Well, I did join a gym last year.
It cost a fortune, and I didn't
get any fitter. Apparently you
have to actually go.
Madge laughs. Norman doesn't. Then realizes that it was a
joke, lets out a too-loud bray of laughter.
CAROL (CONT'D)
And so what do you do, Norman?
NORMAN
Me?
CAROL
Yes.
NORMAN
Oh. I'm
MADGE
Norman's in business.
CAROL
Really?
NORMAN
Yes.
61.
CAROL
What business?
NORMAN
(TO MADGE)
You tell her.
MADGE
Import-Export.
NORMAN
Although these days there's
rather more Ex- than Im-, if you
see what I mean.
CAROL
I'm afraid I don't.
Madge gets up.
MADGE
I have to splash some water on my
face. Please God I drown in it.
She heads for the bathroom.
Norman and Carol share another silence.
CAROL
Well look, it's been lovely
chatting.
NORMAN
No it hasn't.
CAROL
No. It hasn't. But I really
MUST -
NORMAN
Carol?
She was about to go, stops.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Can we drop all this pretence?
And start again? I'm not
charming. I'm not good at
repartee. And I'm not a
plutocrat with the sexual
capacity of a rutting rhino. My
name is Norman. And I'm lonely.
CAROL
My name is Carol. So am I.
Minutes later. Madge comes out of the bathroom.
62.
EVELYN (V.0.)
Day 22. Like Darwin's finches,
we are slowly adapting to our
environment. And when one does
adapt, my god, the riches that
are available.
Madge looks across the bar. And is startled to see Norman
and Carol chatting up a storm, laughing together.
As she watches, Norman orders more drinks, then turns
smiling back to his new friend.
Madge walks slowly out of the bar, and into the night.
Evelyn is at her computer, typing.
EVELYN (V.0.)
There is no past that we can
bring back by longing for it
Jay is counting out cash into Evelyn's hand; her first
paycheck.
EVELYN
And India, like so many things in
life, like life itself I suppose,
is about what you bring to it.
Jean is sitting, reading a book.
JEAN
Will you check in at the bank?
Douglas emerges from the bathroom.
DOUGLAS
I checked yesterday. And the day
before. As requested.
(BEAT)
Will you be staying in again?
JEAN
Why do you ask that every
morning?
DOUGLAS
Because I hope for a different
answer. Because I think you'll
be hurt if I don't. And because
it's not healthy for you to spend
all day and every day in the
confines of the hotel.
He goes back into the bathroom. Jean changes the subject.
JEAN
I didn't sleep a wink. The tap
in there never stops dripping.
DOUGLAS (O.S.)
I talked to Young Wasim about it.
JEAN
What did he say?
DOUGLAS (O.S.)
No idea. It was in Hindi.
Douglas comes out of the bathroom, holding the tap.
DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
I thought I might get it fixed
myself.
63A.
64.
DOUGLAS
No time like the present.
Actually I say that, but I
enjoyed yesterday, and I'm
optimistic about tomorrow too.
JEAN
I wish I could say the same.
DOUGLAS
So do I.
He goes.
Jean sits for a while, looking utterly disconsolate and
lost. Then she gets up, goes over to the balcony.
Down below she can see Graham leaving.
Jean gives up on the sentence she has already read a
hundred times, and snaps her book shut. She stands, then
sits again.
Then stands.
Muriel sits on the only chair.
Opposite - squashed together as if posing for a photograph -
are all the generations of Anokhi's family: Anokhi herself,
her husband, mother, grandmother, and several children.
They all smile at Muriel.
A long pause. Then Muriel turns to Ajit.
MURIEL
How soon can I leave?
Douglas is talking to JAMSHED, who works behind the
counter. Evelyn sits outside.
DOUGLAS
You see what I think, and of
course I'm no expert, is that the
valve seat has eroded, so we'll
need the washer changed and a new
seat re-ground.
Douglas glances back at Evelyn. Who betrays not the
slightest scepticism.
Jamshed studies the tap.
JAMSHED
The gland nut has come away from
the spindle.
DOUGLAS
Well of course, it could be that
too. Can you fix it?
JAMSHED
Not cheaply. Not cheaply. Most
expensively indeed.
Jamshed takes the tap to a workstation at the back, starts
to fiddle with it. Douglas joins Evelyn.
DOUGLAS
I was in a tuk-tuk the other day,
didn't seem to be taking the
usual route back to the hotel.
It turned out that the driver had
decided to take me to another
hotel, that he was sure I would
prefer. And of course one wants
to believe that he genuinely had
my welfare at heart, and that it
wasn't run bg his brother-in-law.
(MORE)
69.
DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
One wants to trust, in general,
don't you think? But you never
really know, do you?
Jamshed stops fiddling with the tap. And takes a hammer to
it.
EVELYN
The day I met my husband was the
day the fair came to town. My
girlfriend and I went on the
carousel. Her horse was fine.
But when the ride began I felt
mine give a little, like it might
collapse. Then these strong arms
were around me, holding the horse
together. And a voice in my ear
said "Just trust me". And I did.
Without question. Until the day
he died.
DOUGLAS
How wonderful.
EVELYN
The sale of our flat went through
last week. I had to sell it to
pay off Hugh's debts.
(BEAT)
I've been forced to get a job out
here. Which, in fact, I love.
But even at Sonny's rates, I
still couldn't make ends meet.
After what my own husband did to
our life savings.
(BEAT)
So no. You're right. You never
know.
Jamshed holds up the tap. Which is now in several parts.
JAMSHED
No good. You must be buying
another.
Muriel is still at the tea party.
Anokhi speaks. Ajit translates.
AJIT
She wants to thank you for your
kindness.
MURIEL
I haven't been kind.
AJIT
You're the only one that
acknowledges her.
Anokhi brings out a plate of food.
ANOKHI
Tarkha dhal. Chapati.
MURIEL
I'm not eating that.
AJIT
You will insult her very deeply
if you do not.
Muriel looks up. They're all still watching, waiting
smiling.
She looks at Anokhi's grandmother, as dignified as she is
old.
Muriel reaches out, takes something off the tray. And has
a bite. It's not too bad.
MURIEL
I'd still rather a Scotch Egg.
Then she sees something through the open doorway: the
children have turned her wheelchair on its side and are
spinning the wheels.
She's on her feet in a flash.
MURIEL (CONT'D)
Get off! Get off it, you dirty
thieving bastards!
Several terrified faces turn.
One little girl starts to cry.
Everyone is staring at Muriel.
MURIEL (CONT'D)
I didn't see. They were playing.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
71.
JAIPUR - DAY
The corridors are full of people patiently waiting their
turn to grapple with a vast bureaucracy.
Reaching the top of the staircase, Jean takes it all in.
She walks down another corridor. Then stops.
Through a doorway, she sees Graham at the desk, talking to
Mr Chidambram.
CUT TO:
In the office.
GRAHAM
But I've filled out that form.
I've given it to you. Many
times.
MR CHIDAMBRAM
There is a process. You are
making an enquiry. For each
enquiry a form must be filled in.
GRAHAM
But it's the same enquiry I make
every day.
MR CHIDAMBRAM
And therefore the same form you
must fill in.
Graham glances towards the doorway, catches sight of Jean.
Their eyes lock, then Jean pulls back out of sight,
panicked.
Jean is hurrying down a corridor. Behind her, Graham
emerges from a doorway, and calls to her
GRAHAM
Mrs Ainslie... .?
105 OMITTED 105
72.
Later. Jean and Graham are sitting in an elegant tea room.
Jean is still very shaken.
JEAN
I don't know how you can bear
this country. What do you see
that I don't?
GRAHAM
Unutterable beauty. Everywhere.
In the light, the colours, the
smiles, the people who see life
as a privilege not a right, and
so teach me something every day.
The waiter brings their tea.
JEAN
Is this milk pasteurized?
WAITER
Yes madam.
JEAN
But that's not true, is it?
You're just lying to me right now
GRAHAM
It'll be fine.
The waiter goes.
GRAHAM (CONT'D)
It's a pleasant surprise to see
you out and about.
JEAN
Is it?
She looks at him.
GRAHAM
Yes. That's progress. Where
were you going?
73.
JEAN
To the bank. I . was going to
the bank. Not that there's any
reason to think something has
changed. But our daughter, you
see, she did promise, and one
does try to remain optimistic.
One has to. Otherwise
OTHERWISE
Graham worries she might be about to break down. He
reaches across the table, puts his hand on hers.
She leans forward, puts her other hand over his, holds on
tightly.
Graham is startled. He tries gently to pull back, but she
holds on.
GRAHAM
JEAN -
JEAN
Oh god. Is it possible you feel
the same?
She brings his hand to her mouth, kisses it.
JEAN (CONT'D)
The way you talk to me. Your
compassion, your understanding
.. the wonderful, tender
consideration, it had to be more
than just -
GRAHAM
I'm gay.
She stares at him. Beat.
JEAN
As in ... happy?
Graham says nothing. Jean lets go of his hand.
JEAN (CONT'D)
Yes. I see. Of course I see.
The ghastly inappropriateness of it all settles on them
both.
JEAN (CONT'D)
I appear to have humiliated
myself. And embarrassed you.
GRAHAM
I'm not embarrassed.
Jean smiles wanly, grateful for his lie.
74.
JEAN
Like I said. This country is
driving me mad.
(BEAT)
Shall we go?
Evelyn is outside in the courtyard. We don't see Douglas.
EVELYN
Anything?
DOUGLAS (O.S.)
Not yet.
Evelyn waits a moment.
EVELYN
How about now?
DOUGLAS (O.S.)
One second.
Another pause.
DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd)
Oh good lord.
EVELYN
What?
DOUGLAS (O.S.)
Listen.
The sound of a flowing tap.
DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd)
And now ...
The tap stops.
DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd)
No drip.
He appears in the doorway, triumphant.
DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
No drip!
He walks towards her, hand in the air.
DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
Hi-five !
Evelyn just looks at him. She's never hi-fived anyone in
her life.
After a moment Douglas puts his hand down.
75.
DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
I've never done that before. It
just seemed appropriate.
Jean has appeared at the other side of the courtyard.
Douglas senses her mood, moves towards her.
DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
Darling!
EVELYN
Mrs Ainslie, how are you? Did
you have a good day?
Jean doesn't answer. She's staring at Douglas. Who looks
so happy.
DOUGLAS
Let me tell you about ours. Your
husband of many a year, who has
never even known which end of a
hammer to use, has actually
managed to -
JEAN
(SUDDENLY INTERRUPTING)
We have to get out of here.
DOUGLAS
What did you say?
JEAN
I can't stay in this country a
moment longer.
DOUGLAS
Why ...?
EVELYN
Do excuse me.
She makes a tactful exit. Jean is going past Douglas into
their room.
DOUGLAS
I don't understand
JEAN
(INTERRUPTING)
Pick a reason. Pick ten. The
climate, the squalor, the poverty
She goes past him into their room.
76.
JEAN
. we should never have come.
This whole trip is a grotesque
fantasy. It's time to go home.
Jean starts to pack. Irrationally, compulsively.
DOUGLAS
Who's paying for the tickets?
JEAN
(not hearing him)
Look at us. A group of self-
deluding old fossils traipsing
around as if it's our bloody gap
year. Humiliating ourselves
DOUGLAS
Not us, we can't pay. And I
don't see you asking our friends
BACK HOME
JEAN
(OVERLAPPING)
.. We should just face up to the
truth. That we're all old, we're
all past it. That's the real
truth, the raw, unvarnished fact
of the matter. All we're good
for now is the beige bloody
bungalow with the sodding panic
button in the sodding corner ...
She stops packing, and subsides onto the bed, crying
quietly.
Nobody speaks for a while.
DOUGLAS
(GENTLY)
We just have to make the best of
it, darling. I really think
that's the best thing to do.
JEAN
Yes, well. When I want your
opinion, I'll give it to you.
An impossibly small roadside clinic.
Norman is sitting there, the only man in three rows of
brightly dressed women.
DR RAMA comes out of the consulting area.
77.
DR RAMA
Mr John Smith.
No response. The doctor looks at Norman, who has forgotten
his own alias.
DR RAMA (cont'd)
Mr John Smith?
Norman jumps up.
NORMAN
That's right! Me!
Sonny is at the flower market, sitting on his motor bike,
waiting for the flower vendor to tie up his bundle of
marigolds. He's on his phone.
SONNY
Come on. Pick up pick up pick
up.
The phone is answered at the other end.
SONNY (CONT'D)
(INTO PHONE)
Sunaina, I must see you. I must.
If I cannot hold your body
against mine, I swear I will go
mad.
We cut to the call centre. It's not Sunaina on the phone,
but Jay, who is standing next to her.
SONNY'S VOICE
(ON PHONE)
I yearn for you, I burn for you,
I -
JAY
I think it's my sister you're
burning for there, Sonny boy.
SONNY
Thank you, Jay. Thank you.
Jay hands the phone to Sunaina.
SUNAINA
Hey.
SONNY
Private line, Sunaina. Do those
words mean nothing to you?
78.
SUNAINA
He took the phone. What could I
do?
SONNY
I miss you. I miss you every
moment. Come and see me.
Tonight.
SUNAINA
I cannot tonight. It is my
parents 25th wedding anniversary.
Tell your mother that.
SONNY
Come after. Come late
SUNANINA
You'll be asleep.
SONNY
I'll be waiting.
SUNANINA
You'll be asleep. But i can wake
you in that special way...
SONNY
You will sneak in?
SUNAINA
I'm not ashamed.
SONNY
Neither am I. Absolutely not.
There is no shame. You do not
have to sneak.
(BEAT)
All the same, if you did want to
be very quiet, and not let anyone
see you, it couldn't hurt.
Norman is talking to DR RAMA.
NORMAN
I'm worried there's no lead in my
pencil.
DR RAMA
OK. I don't know what that
means.
NORMAN
No snap in my celery.
DR RAMA
I'm still not quite with you.
78A.
NORMAN
I plan to party hearty tonight,
but I can't guarantee that my
love gun will fire.
DR RAMA
Mr Smith -
NORMAN
Will the lance dance, and the
trouser lion roar?
DR RAMA
What is your problem?
79.
NORMAN
I don't know if I can still have
sex.
DR RAMA
Ah.
NORMAN
I'm not a young man anymore,
doctor. And I'm a little bit
scared. Truth be told, I'm a lot
scared.
DR RAMA
How long since you've been with a
woman?
NORMAN
What's today?
DR RAMA
Monday.
NORMAN
Six years.
DR RAMA
I've got some pills that'll help.
Sonny is in his office, going through the accounts.
There's a strange ringing somewhere nearby. He pays no
attention, then stops and thinks for a moment. Then
realises what it is.
He sweeps the pile of papers off the desk, starts
frantically looking for the telephone.
Sonny is sleeping peacefully.
Sonny sleeps on.
Sunaina is definitely sneaking now. She aims down the
passage towards Sonny's room.
Sonny stirs, but doesn't wake up.
Sunaina comith esno te bedroom.
She takes off her clothes. And climbs, naked, into bed
beside the sleeping figure.
A loud scream.
In a different bed, in a different room, Sonny wakes up.
And remembers.
87.
It's Sunaina that's screamed. Because she's in bed with
Madge.
Who couldn't be happier.
MADGE
A midnight booty call. How
utterly marvellous.
Sonny hares out of his temporary bedroom, and races down
the corridor, towards Madge's room.
Sunaina has jumped out of the bed and across the room,
grabbing one of Madge's generous scarves to cover her
nakedness.
SUNAINA
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry . I
don't know what your name is, but
I'm incredibly sorry.
MADGE
Don't be. Most action I've had
in weeks.
SUNAINA
If you could just please not
MENTION -
Sonny bursts in.
SONNY
Do not worry, Mrs Hardcastle! I
can explain each and every thing!
Hesees Sunaina.
SONNY (CONT'D)
Oh my god you are naked.
He turns to Madge.
SONNY (CONT'D)
Mrs Hardcastle, I must apologise
with deep and profound sincerity -
SUNAINA
How could you not tell me you
weren't in your room!
88.
SONNY
Yes, Sunaina, to you too I must
apologise with equally deep and
profound sincerity. Now go. Get
out. Quickly.
SUNAINA
I'm going. Just let me get
dressed, and -
SONNY
No no, quicker than that. You
must leave, before -
MrsKapoor flings open the door.
MRS KAPOOR
What is going on here? Who
screamed?
She sees the nearly-naked Sunaina.
MRS KAPOOR (cont'd)
No no no no no. No! This is a
respectable hotel, not a brothel.
(TO SUNAINA)
You, get out.
(TO MADGE)
And Mrs Hardcastle, I expected
better of you. Actually, this is
exactly what I expected of you,
but nevertheless -
SUNAINA
Mrs Kapoor, I'm Sunaina.
MRS KAPOOR
Since I will not be paying for
your services, your name is of no
interest to me.
(BEAT)
How do you know mine?
Sunaina is shocked to realise that Mrs Kapoor doesn't know
her name. Sonny steps forward reluctantly.
SONNY
Because this . is my Sunaina.
MRS KAPOOR
The girl who my son described as
not too modern.
MADGE
This is getting interesting.
MRS KAPOOR
(TO SUNAINA)
Tell me, please.
(MORE)
89.
MRS KAPOOR (cont'd)
Is there anyone in this building
you haven't slept with?
SONNY
Mummyji, do not get the wrong
idea. Sunaina was not here to be
with Mrs Hardcastle. She was
here to have sex with me!
Mrs Kapoor turns to Sunaina. Who is speechless.
MRS KAPOOR
This is the sort of woman you
are. OK. Each to her own. But
do not ever try and tell me that
you are suitable wife for my son.
(BEAT)
Find your clothes and go. I
don't expect to see you again.
Evelyn stares out of the window. Madge, Norman, Douglas
and Jean are behind her. Opposite sits Manoj. Evelyn
turns to look at him, and at Gaurika, Manoj's wife, who
sits beside him.
EVELYN (V.0.)
We all know it'll happen, but few
of us know when. Graham died of
a heart attack, evidently not his
first. So he had a better idea
than most what was coming, he
just neglected to tell us. His
prerogative.
Douglas closes the door.
DOUGLAS
She was upset.
JEAN
Spare me your explanations.
D'you think I'm jealous?
DOUGLAS
I don't see why else you would
have embarrassed me. And Evelyn.
JEAN
You were already doing a
perfectly good job of
embarrassing yourself. Can you
imagine how ghastly it's been for
everyone to watch you mooning
around after that simpering doe-
eyed ex-housewife, taking
advantage of her loneliness and -
DOUGLAS
God, can you hear yourself? Can
you? Do you have any idea what a
terrible person you've become?
Jean is stunned into silence.
DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
All you give out is this endless
negativity, a refusal to see any
kind of light and joy even when
it's right in your face, and a
desperate need to squash any sign
of happiness in me or anyone else
.. it's a wonder I don't fling
myself at the first kind word or
gesture that comes my way. But I
don't. Out of some dried-out
notion of loyalty and respect,
neither of which I ever bloody
get in return.
97.
There's a long silence.
JEAN
I checked my emails. This came.
She hands him a piece of paper.
Mrs Kapoor is at the desk, going through the accounts.
Sonny stands opposite her.
SONNY
Mummyji, please -
MRS KAPOOR
These figures do not support your
argument.
SONNY
There is still time to turn
things around. With a small
injection of funds, we can -
MRS KAPOOR
Who is trusting you with that
money? Eh? You, who cannot run
a chai stand. Just like your
father.
100.
Beat. Then Sonny speaks quietly.
SONNY
Do I remind you of him so much?
Is that why you must be cruel to
me?
MRS KAPOOR
You think I am cruel?
SONNY
You loved my father. And he
loved this hotel.
MRS KAPOOR
(FIERCELY)
Two mistakes. There will not be
a third.
(BEAT)
Say goodbye to all this, Sonny.
And come with me to Delhi. Your
life will become easier.
SONNY
Not easier, Mummyji. Smaller.
He leaves.
Mrs Kapoor comes back to the desk, fiddling with some
paperwork, discomfited.
She turns to the doorway. Muriel is there, in her chair.
MRS KAPOOR
Mrs Donnelly. Can I help you?
MURIEL
Depends. Do you know how to use
a computer?
MRS KAPOOR
I assume you are joking.
MURIEL
Mrs Ainslie said she had an
address where I could get some
things I need. Some biscuits.
She said I could get them on the
line.
MRS KAPOOR
I wish you luck.
Mrs Kapoor smiles, and leaves.
Muriel watches her go, then turns to the computer.
Her fingers fly across the keyboard.
101.
The train rattles its way through the night. Jean is
chatting away, in a better mood than we've seen her for
some time. Evelyn listens in silence.
JEAN
The whole thing is actually
tremendously exciting. Not just
getting on a plane, but getting
on a plane and turning left.
NORMAN
Turning left?
JEAN
First class. And home in time
for our 40th wedding anniversary.
We haven't yet decided how to
mark the occasion.
MADGE
Perhaps a minute's silence?
Ajit keeps watch, while Muriel is at the printer. Waiting
as it disgorges pages.
155 OMITTED 155
Douglas and Jean are in the tuk-tuk with Madge and Norman.
There is a sombre atmosphere.
A motor-bike hurtles past them, going the other way.
DOUGLAS
Was that Sonny?
A phone is ringing. Christopher is still in bed, his wife
Polly asleep next to him.
He answers.
CHRISTOPHER
YES
(can't believe his ears)
Ma?
Douglas is checking they haven't left anything. Jean is at
the door. She's impatient.
JEAN
DOUGLAS
Sunaina picks up her mobile, looks at the message.
Jean is sitting in the taxi, which is driven by BARUM.
Douglas climbs in.
A beat.
DOUGLAS
My wallet, I forgot my wallet.
One second.
Before Jean has a chance to say anything, he goes back in.
108.
She watches him go.
Evelyn is at her window, listening. She turns to watch him
leave.
Sonny keeps going up, floor after floor.
109.
SONNY
(YELLING)
Sunaina! Sunaina!
He reaches the seventh floor.
Jay appears on the landing above him.
JAY
What's going on?
Sonny is doubled over, totally out of breath. Holds up a
finger.
JAY (CONT'D)
Sonny?
SONNY
I need to see Sunaina!
JAY
Her shift's not over. And when
it is, she doesn't want to see
you.
Beat.
SONNY
Jay, you are the son my mother
wished I was; an intelligent man,
with a strong head for business.
You see things as they are, not
as you wish them to be. So fuck
off out of my way.
Jaydoesn't move.
SONNY (CONT'D)
Or you can give her a message.
Sunaina is standing against the wall, unseen by Sonny,
listening.
SONNY (CONT'D)
Tell her from me what I should
have told her the day we met.
What I will announce to anyone
who asks. And many who do not.
Sunaina speaks to Jay.
SUNAINA
Including your mother?
JAY
(TO SONNY)
Including my mother?
SUNAINA
His mother.
110.
JAY
(TO SONNY)
Your mother.
SONNY
I will tell every mother in the
land.
SUNAINA
(TO JAY)
What will you tell them?
JAY
(TO SONNY)
What will you tell them?
SONNY
The only thing that matters in
this world. That I love you.
And always will.
(BEAT)
And by you, I mean Sunaina, Jay,
not you. Although if you are to
be my brother-in-law, I hope we
can become better friends.
SUNAINA
Why is he only saying this now?
JAY
(TO SUNAINA)
You ask him.
SUNAINA
Why are you only saying this now?
SONNY
Because, Sunaina, love of my
life, no more will I believe that
I am not worthy, for only by
loving you as you deserve will I
become so.
On Sunaina's face as she hears this.
Douglas and Jean are sitting in the traffic jam.
DOUGLAS
It's funny. They call it rush
hour, but nothing actually moves.
(BEAT)
It's not that funny.
(BEAT)
Although I suppose it's all about
context, isn't it? I mean -
JEAN
Douglas?
DOUGLAS
Yes?
JEAN
If you say one more word, I'll
kill you with my thumbs.
Evelyn is at her computer typing.
119.
EVELYN (V.0.)
And the measure of success is how
we cope with disappointment. As
we always must.
Evelyn is still sitting, fully dressed in her room. She's
been up all night.
Her alarm clock buzzes. She turns it off.
