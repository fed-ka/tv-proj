      CLOSE ON a picture of JULIA  JULES  COBB IN HER TWENTIES, 
      stunning in a bikini.  Jules has no filter, and if she 
      weren t so aggressively friendly, you d say she was pushy, 
      sarcastic -- even relentless.  CUT WIDE TO REVEAL JULES AT 
      40, NAKED (post shower), comparing the old picture to her 
      current self in the mirror.  She pokes at her body, tugs at 
      her arm skin, pulls her belly tight so there s no wrinkles, 
      etc.  Then, re: her reflection, pissed:

                                  JULES
                    Fuck!  

      SHE DIMS THE BRIGHT LIGHTS, THEN TAKES ANOTHER LOOK:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Much better.

      As she checks out her butt and shrugs, pleased:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules dials the phone.  When it s answered she holds the 
      receiver out as she pours a glass of wine.  Then, into phone:

                                  JULES
                    Elle, that s your wine being 
                    poured.  Get over here.


      ELLE KELLER, 42 and attractive, is on her phone.  An upper-
      east side type, Elle is mean, scary, and fiercely loyal to 
      Jules.  She s wearing a CLEAVAGE REVEALING NIGHTGOWN.

                                  ELLE 
                    I can t, I promised my husband that 
                    we d start having sex once a month 
                    without it having to be a quickie 
                    and the fucker actually called me 
                    on it.  Andy s in the shower 
                    shaving his beard because if he 
                    doesn t, forty minutes from now my 
                    inner thighs will look like someone 
                    took a disk sander to them.                                                                                      4.


                                  JULES
                    Graphic.  Why so pissy?

                                  ELLE
                    I m fat.

                                  JULES
                    You re not.

                                  ELLE
                    I am.  I woke up fat.

                                  JULES
                    Yeah, I m not buying it. 

      Jules goes to her window and pulls up the shade REVEALING 
      ELLE IN THE HER WINDOW TEN YARDS AWAY (they re neighbors).

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Wow, you look slutty. 

                                  ELLE
                          (touched)
                    Really?

                                  JULES
                    Total riverboat whore.

                                  ELLE
                    Love you.  I thought you had a date 
                    tonight with Larry the lawyer.

                                  JULES
                    Yeah, I had to cancel it. 

                                  ELLE
                    Why?

                                  JULES
                    Because he s ugly and sixty.  
                    Fucking Florida.

                                  ELLE
                    Hey, if you re bored and want to 
                    hate yourself, do what I did and 
                    try on all your old lingerie.

                                  JULES
                    Yeah, I only model lingerie by 
                    myself on Saturday nights.  On 
                    Friday nights I look up old high 
                    school boyfriends on the internet.

                                  ANDY (O.C.)
                    Let s do this, woman.                                                                                      5.


                                  ELLE
                    Ugh, I have to go.

      Elle hangs up.  ANDY KELLER is 40, sweet, not as hot as Elle 
      and is unaffected by her edge.  Though she d never admit it, 
      she LOVES HIM DEEPLY.  Currently Andy s thumb is fairly deep 
      INSIDE HIS NOSTRIL, PICKING.  HE DOESN T STOP:

                                  ANDY
                    I have a little scab up there.

                                  ELLE
                    You are so sexy.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules (in sweats) looks through her old lingerie.  She grabs 
      the two glasses of wine (hers and Elle s) as Tad comes down.

                                  JULES 
                    If you don t have plans tonight we 
                    could hang out on the couch and 
                    watch a movie.

                                  TAD
                          (re: two wines)
                    Are you hitting on me?

                                  JULES
                    Huh?  Oh, no, this wine is for 
                    Elle.  That s why I have my 
                    lingerie out.  She s coming over 
                    later and we re going to experiment 
                    a little.  
                          (off Tad s stare)
                    Okay, that was supposed to be a 
                    joke but you seem really 
                      uncomfortable.  

      THIS IS HOW SHE TALKS TO HIM SOMETIMES.  IT MAKES HIM CRAZY.

                                  TAD
                    Ryan s picking me up.  Where s my 
                    jacket?

      Tad EXITS, looking.  Jules picks up a RED BRA/PANTIE combo: 

                                  JULES
                    I wonder if I could still pull this 
                    off?  Honestly, the whole ensemble 
                    creeps me out.  But that might be 
                    because it was a Christmas gift 
                    from your shithead Dad s shithead 
                    brother.  Lovely family.                                                                                      6.


                                  TAD 
                          (returns wearing jacket)
                    Ryan s mom just says  good night .

                                  JULES
                    Love you.  And remember, home by 
                    twelve, and if I ever catch you or 
                    Ryan drinking and driving I ll show 
                    everyone that baby picture of you 
                    two holding each other s penises.

                                  TAD
                    Bye, Mom.

      And he s gone.  Bored, Jules looks at the phone.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The room is black, the phone rings and an OLDER, ODD-LOOKING 
      MAN (60ish), wakes, turns on the light and answers the phone.

                                  LARRY
                    This is Larry.


      Jules talks to Larry the lawyer.  From now on we INTERCUT:

                                  JULES
                    It s eight-thirty on a Friday 
                    night, why are you already asleep?  
                    I guess I m no better, I m just 
                    sitting in my den, all by myself... 
                          (beat, then, tersely)
                    Larry!

      REVEAL Larry is asleep on the phone.  Startled, he wakes.

                                  LARRY
                    This is Larry.

      Jules hangs up and sits back on the couch.  She sighs, and 
      looks around, lonely.  Fed up, she grabs her keys and exits.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules is in line at the counter holding various junk treats 
      and magazines.  She looks down the aisle and sees an 
      incredibly HANDSOME YOUNG MAN (20s) DRINKING FROM A MILK 
      CARTON.  Lost in his looks, Jules reacts.  TIGHTER ON THE 
      YOUNG MAN S FACE as rivulets of milk run down his cheek and 
      neck.  Flushed, Jules turns back to the counter.                                                                                        7.


      The young man, NOW SHIRTLESS, ENTERS THE FRAME BEHIND HER AND 
      KISSES HER NECK.  Jules moans:

                                  JULES
                    Holy crap.

      Jules is snapped out of her fantasy by the cashier, who waits 
      to ring her up.  He knows she s ogling the handsome guy.

                                    CASHIER
                    Ma'am, whenever you re done.

                                  JULES
                          (flustered)
                    Sorry.  He is a cutie.

      The MARRIED COUPLE in line behind Jules shake their heads 
      judgmentally.  Mortified, Jules addresses them calmly:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Please don t shake your heads at 
                    me.  It makes me want to cry.
                          (they stop)
                    Thank you.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Elle HOLDS her baby and talks on the phone.

                                  ELLE
                    Stan.  My baby s name is Stan.  How 
                      ridiculous is that?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    11.

                    He d be Spencer if my husband s 
                    stupid father hadn t gone and died, 
                    like, a week before he was born.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      It s a modest office.  Laurie sits at her desk as Jules talks 
      on the phone and gathers her things.  WE INTERCUT:

                                  JULES
                    Honey, is this call about anything?  
                    I have to go sell a house.

                                  ELLE
                    That means your little, baby 
                    assistant is there with you.  Say 
                    out loud that you re better friends 
                    with me than with her.

                                  JULES
                    Why are you in your crazy place?

                                  ELLE 
                    I haven t seen you in person for 
                    weeks and we live next door to each 
                    other!  You re coming over tonight 
                    to play Scrabble after I put this 
                    thing to bed.

                                  JULES
                    Fine.  And don t call Stan a thing.

      Jules hangs up and they head out the door.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules drives through Seahaven, an odd mixture of old Florida 
      and a new town trying to be trendy.  Laurie sits next to her.   

                                  LAURIE 
                    This town has changed so much since 
                    I was a kid--

      Jules SLAMS ON the brakes.  Laurie lurches forward:

                                  LAURIE (CONT D)
                    Give a girl a warning.  My uterus 
                    almost shot out.


      BARBARA (50s), a conservative realtor, shows her clients (MAN 
      60, WOMAN 24) the home.  Jules speaks to the woman.

                                  JULES
                    Take as much time as you need.  The 
                    master bedroom is upstairs...
                          (under her breath)
                    If you want to see where your 
                    husband will eventually croak on 
                    top of you.

      Laurie laughs.  Barb approaches demurely. 

                                    BARBARA
                    Good morning, girls.  How is 
                      everything?

                                  LAURIE
                    Awesome, Barb.  I finally got Jules 
                    off her ass and tonight we re going 
                    to get us some--

                                  JULES
                    Excuse us.

      Jules pulls Laurie outside. 


      Jules enters and starts filling out a check, annoyed.

                                  BOBBY 
                    You know, Oprah said that when a 
                    marriage falls apart, both people 
                    need to take responsibility for 
                    their roles.

                                  JULES
                    I dropped out of college to support 
                    you and raise our kid while you 
                    spent twenty years trying to make 
                    it on the tour and drilling 
                    anything that moved.  

                                  BOBBY
                    Right.  And maybe you should ask 
                    yourself what you did to make me do 
                    that.

                    Kidding.  I know I was an ass.                                                                                     15.


                                  JULES
                          (smiles, hands over check)
                    Hey, for old time s sake, you want 
                    to go upstairs and have sex?

                                  BOBBY
                    Uh, yeah.

                                  JULES
                    I don t.

                                  BOBBY
                    That must have felt good.

                                  JULES
                    It did. 

      He smiles and exits.  Jules reacts casually (this is normal).

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Tad and Jules enter the home office waiting room.

                                  JULES
                    Plus, I list Dr. Ellis  house for 
                    him, so you get free sessions.  

      GRAYSON EMERGES (He s the Shrink! Yay!) escorting out a 
      SOBBING TEEN.  Jules and Tad AWKWARDLY LOOK AWAY.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I ll call later to check on you.

      The second the sobbing girl exits, Jules sighs with relief:

                                  JULES
                    Wooo!  What s wrong with her?                                                                                    16.


                                    GRAYSON
                    I don t know.  She wasn t crying 
                    when she came in.  You re up, Tad.  
                          (as Tad heads in)
                    And do not take your shoes off 
                    again if you aren t wearing socks.  
                    It s disgusting.

                                  JULES
                    I figured out how to get you back 
                    for yesterday.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Please God, let it be the silent 
                      treatment. 

                                  JULES
                    I decided that we re friends.
                          (off his reaction)
                    When we see each other we ll talk 
                    about your life, whether you re 
                    happy or sad - we re friends.

                                    GRAYSON
                    You can t just decide that we re 
                    friends.

                                  JULES
                    Uh, I just did.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I don t like this.

                                  JULES
                    That s okay.  Sometimes friends are 
                    mad at each other but they always 
                    go back to being friends.  

                                    GRAYSON
                    Stop it.

                                  JULES
                    Bye, call you later.

      As she leaves, we stay on Grayson s reaction.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Laurie sits in an armchair.  She calls out.

                                  LAURIE
                    Why aren t you ready yet?

      Jules pokes her head out of the bathroom, still in a towel.                                                                                    17.


                                  JULES
                    Well, I can t find my favorite 
                    base.  Also, I m old and saggy and 
                      disgusting and I never really had 
                    my twenties so I have no idea how 
                    I m supposed to act or look, and 
                    even though I made fun of stupid 
                    Larry for going to bed early, if 
                    I m out after ten o clock, I get 
                    sleepy, and I hate you.

                                  LAURIE
                    Wow, that came out all at once.

                                  JULES
                    I m not doing this.  I m happy the 
                    way things are. 

      Laurie grabs the long pillow placed vertically on Jules  bed.

                                  LAURIE 
                    Twenty bucks says you sleep wrapped 
                    around this thing like it s some 
                    kind of pillow-man.

                                  JULES
                    His name is Jonathan.  What am I 
                    wearing?

      As Laurie tosses her an outfit:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Grayson sits angrily in thought.  Tad slumps on a chair.

                                    GRAYSON
                    We may have to talk about me 
                    killing your mother.

                                  TAD
                    Why was that girl crying?

                                    GRAYSON
                    She snapped and cut off her dog s 
                    feet.

                                  TAD
                    Really?

                                    GRAYSON
                    No, I m not allowed to tell you.  
                    How s your dad?                                                                                    18.


                                  TAD
                    Still talking about how he knows 
                    Tiger Woods.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Does he?

                                  TAD
                    He knows who Tiger Woods is.
                          (then)
                    At least with my mom, I always come 
                    first, you know?

                                    GRAYSON
                    And you need that?     

      The following line bridges the cut as VOICE OVER:

                                  TAD
                    Yeah, maybe I do.  Mom s okay.  I 
                    mean, I wish she didn t have to say 
                    exactly what s she s thinking the 
                    second she thinks it...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules enters to see Florida s idea of a Manhattan bar.  Young 
      people interact with older men and cougars.  MS. PRITCHETT 
      NOW PROUDLY FLAUNTS HER NEW BOOBS IN A TANK TOP.

                                  LAURIE
                    Look, she s getting used to them.
                          (re: Jules)
                    You seem nervous.  Say something 
                      judgmental about me, that always 
                    loosens you up.

                                  JULES 
                    You can t wear fake nails on just 
                    one hand.  It looks insane.    

                                  LAURIE
                    I only had four left.  And this is 
                    the hand I smoke with.  Better?
                          (Jules nods)
                    First round s on me.

      Laurie goes to the bar.  Barb approaches looking different; 
      tight dress, heels, make-up -- She is Barb, QUEEN COUGAR. 

                                  JULES 
                    Barb?  What are you doing here?

                                    BARBARA
                    Having a glass of Pinot with my 
                    sister, trying to score some dick.  

                                  JULES
                    Oh, well... Good luck with that.  I 
                    have to go over here.

      Jules turns away KNOCKING INTO MATT (26, attractive).  His 
      drink explodes all over his shirt.  He looks at Jules.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Hi, I m Jules.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:

      LAURIE LOOKS OVER AT Jules and Matt now in mid-conversation.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    ... I can t believe you went to 
                    college in London.  I always wanted 
                    to do stuff like that.

                                  MATT
                    Why didn t you?                                                                                    20.


                                  JULES
                    You know how it goes.  I was 
                    nineteen, met a guy, started 
                    thinking with my hoo-hoo, and boom-- 
                    I jammed out a kid.
                          (finishes drink)
                    Boy, you are hot as balls.  Sorry, 
                    this is my second drink and all 
                    I ve eaten today is finger skin.

                                  MATT
                    Gross.  Want me to get you a water? 

                                  JULES
                    Yeah, but have them put it in a 
                    drink glass with a lime so I still 
                    look cool.

      Matt exits, REVEALING BARB, who mouths  hit that .  Jules 
      turns to see Ms. Pritchett all over a young man.  Jules looks 
      at a MIRROR and sees herself surrounded by youth (guys in 
      baseball hats, young girls, etc.).  HORRIFIED, JULES LEAVES.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules enters to a ringing phone.  She answers it.


      Elle sits on the phone, by a Scrabble board.  WE INTERCUT.

                                  ELLE
                    I can t believe you stood me up.  
                    I m so pissed at you--

                                  JULES
                    Sorry, sorry, I totally forgot.  
                    I ll be right over.

      Jules hangs up and rushes upstairs, then:

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:                                                                                    21.


      Jules (hair up, wearing sweats) rushes downstairs and opens 
      her front door.  MATT S there,  STARTLING HER.  Laurie leans 
      out the window of A RANDOM GUY S car:

                                  LAURIE
                    You left that at the bar!  I m 
                    either going home with this nice 
                    gentleman or I m having him drop me  
                    at Dale s.  I haven t decided yet.

                                  JULES
                    Not Dale s!

      They DRIVE OFF.  Jules looks at Matt for a beat, then:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    This is so awkward I feel like my 
                    face might explode.

                                  MATT
                    May I come in?

                                  JULES
                    Uh... sure, okay, yeah.

      As he enters, she frantically lets her hair down and shakes 
      it out, sexy.  It doesn t work.  Then, re: her hair:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    That didn t work.  Can I get you a 
                    snack?  That s what I do for my 
                    son s friends, I get them snacks.  
                    Do you like crackers with peanut 
                    butter on them?

                                  MATT
                    I m okay.  I hope it s not too 
                    forward - coming over here.

                                  JULES
                          (turns away)
                    Look, Matt, you re a good kid, but 
                    this isn t really how I roll--
                          (he kisses her neck)
                    Oh my god, that s a neck kiss.

      The phone rings, snapping Jules out of her bliss:

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Should I call the police?

                                  JULES
                    No.  I went to a bar, and-- just go 
                    look at him.

      Elle puts the phone down and runs out of the room.


      Elle enters and flicks on the lights even though Andy is 
      sleeping.  He momentarily stirs.

                                  ANDY
                    What...?

      Elle goes to the window, LOOKS OVER AT MATT in Jules  window, 
      reacts and runs out without shutting off the lights.

                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                    Come on!!


      Elle runs back in and picks up the phone.

                                  ELLE
                    Go do horrible things to that young 
                    boy right now.

                                  JULES
                    No, I need time to prepare.  I have 
                    to go buy candles, I look good in 
                      flickering light.  Oh my God, what 
                    if he wants to keep the lights on?? 

                                  ELLE
                    Alright, deep breath.  You re good 
                    at sex, right?  

                                  JULES
                    I m like a seven.

                                  ELLE
                    I m a nine.  Now look...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      As Jules frantically gets ready we hear Elle s speech:                                                                                    23.


                                  ELLE (V.O.)
                    ...No matter how hot he is, he s 
                    still a man, so he s less confident 
                    than you, sexually.  Just take 
                    charge of the situation the second 
                    you enter the room.  

      Ready, Jules turns confidently to enter the bedroom.


      Matt lies on the bed.  The room is BRIGHT.  The bathroom door 
      opens a crack, and ONLY JULES  ARM COMES OUT, BLINDLY 
      SEARCHING FOR THE DIMMER.  She finds it, turns the lights 
      down, then ENTERS THE ROOM, POSING CONFIDENTLY.  From the 
      bed, MATT TURNS THE LIGHTS BACK UP.

                                  MATT
                    I want to see you.

                                  JULES
                    Here I am.

                                  MATT
                    What s that scar from?

                                  JULES
                    I got knifed when I was a kid.

                                  MATT
                    Really?

                                  JULES
                    No, it s from my C-section.
                          (re: armpit)
                    And this little fella here is a 
                    skin tag -- What am I doing?

      Moment of truth.  Jules TAKES CONTROL:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Okay, listen up.  Lights off, 
                    condom on, and put Jonathan under 
                    your hips.

                                  MATT
                    Who?

                                  JULES
                    The big pillow.  No more talking.

      As Jules hits the lights:

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    24.



      The lights are dim.  ANGLE ON Jules, on the couch, in heaven.

                                  JULES
                    I feel like I can see colors again.  
                    That was amazing.  

      REVEAL Matt next to her eating crackers with peanut butter.

                                  MATT
                    Yeah.  And thanks for making these.  
                    After you offered before I couldn t 
                    get them out of my head.

                                  JULES
                    Three times.  We had sex three 
                    times without you needing a nap, or 
                    pills or anything.  How fun is 
                    that?

                                  MATT
                    Pretty fun.

                                  JULES 
                    Would it be okay if I did something 
                    I haven t done in years?  I always 
                    told my husband that I hated it, 
                    but I don t hate it, I love it.

                                  MATT
                    You can do anything you want to me.

                                  JULES
                    Fun!

                                  MATT
                    So what are you going to--

                                  JULES
                    Again, no talking.
                          (she slides down)
                    Just watch.

      Jules undoes his jeans (suggesting oral-sex).  ANGLE ON door.  
      Tad enters and reacts.  Then, Jules badly covers to Tad:

                                  JULES (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    There he is!

      REVEAL Bobby is at the door, too.  He calmly addresses Jules:

                                  BOBBY
                    You said you hated that.

                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    25.


                                          ACT THREE


      Jules sits, the weight of last night on her shoulders.  She 
      casually prepares to eat a banana.  Tad enters, snatches it 
      from her hand and throws it away.

                                  TAD
                    You re not allowed to eat those 
                    anymore.

                                  JULES
                    Look, Tad, I hope you know what you 
                    saw is very natural.  You re 
                      seventeen, of course you know that.  
                    It s probably been done to you a 
                    number of times.  Has it?  You know 
                    what, that s probably off topic. 
                          (Tad leaves)
                    We ll talk later.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules enters to see Laurie.

                                  JULES
                    Well, I may have to kill myself--

      Jules stops when she sees Elle (with stroller).

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Why are you here?

                                  ELLE
                    You never called and told me what 
                    happened.  See, I used to be your 
                    best friend.  But now that I m 
                    stuck at home and you blow me off 
                    to go to bars and chase men, my 
                    only option is to come here and 
                    listen to you share everything 
                    about your life with this dummy. 

                                  LAURIE
                    She s been here forty minutes and 
                    that s the nicest thing she s said.                                                                                    26.


                                  ELLE
                    Go push Stan around the block, 
                    we re having grown-up talk.

                                  LAURIE
                    Stan?  Is your baby sixty?

                                  JULES
                    Laurie, please?  For me.

      As Laurie reacts and pushes Stan out, Jules turns to Elle:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    You d like her if you gave her a 
                    chance.

                                  ELLE
                    Pass.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules and Elle now sit and talk.

                                  ELLE 
                    You know why I really came here?  
                    Remember how Andy drinks coffee 
                    like every sip is sooo delicious?  
                    He was doing it this morning and it 
                    made me want to murder him so I 
                    need you to say your thing.                                                                                    27.


                                  JULES
                    No one in the world is meant for 
                    you more than Andy and you love him  
                    with all your heart.

                                  ELLE 
                    I know, it s so annoying.  Look, I 
                    know you have your own problems...

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      We rejoin their conversation.

                                  ELLE 
                    ... But we had a plan.  We were 
                    going to have stupid cookouts with 
                    our stupid husbands, take awful 
                    vacations together.  Now I m always 
                    busy with the baby and you re back 
                    out there in the world, which I 
                    don t like at all by the way...  I 
                    just want us to still have time for 
                    each other.  I love you.

                                  JULES
                    I love you back, but twice as much, 
                    and in a more vulnerable way.  And  
                    Elle... I always have time for you.

      As Jules  phone rings:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Through glass we see THE PRINCIPAL explain what happened to 
      Jules (Tad next to her).  He MIMES BEATING SOMEONE with a 
      sign.  Jules and Tad exit the office.  Then, all business:

                                  JULES
                    Go get your stuff.

      As Tad moves off, Jules turns to see Bobby.                                                                                    28.


                                  BOBBY
                    He does not look happy.

                                  JULES
                    The school called you?

                                  BOBBY
                    What?  No, I m here on an unrelated 
                    matter.  Apparently they have a 
                      landscaping position that I might 
                      potentially be interested in.  

                                  TAD
                          (returning)
                    Please, Dad, cut the lawns at my 
                    school, that s exactly what I need!

      Tad storms off, then Jules gets in Bobby s face.

                                  JULES
                    He was supposed to sleep at your 
                    apartment last night.  Couldn t you 
                    come through for me, just once?!!

      Jules storms off.  An ADMINISTRATOR approaches Bobby:

                                    ADMINISTRATOR
                    Ready, Mr. Cobb?

                                  BOBBY
                          (unconcerned)
                    Let s do this.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Barbara (dressed conservative) stands with Laurie and Jules  
      as the same clients from before walk around.  Then, sotto:

                                  JULES
                    I think they re going to buy.  
                    Thank God waterfront property is 
                    recession proof.

                                    BARBARA
                    No shit.  I need the cash to get my 
                    face done.
                          (pulls back face)
                    How does this look?

                                  JULES
                    Like you re sky diving.

                                  LAURIE
                    You know, it was easy pushing your 
                    scary friend s baby around.  Maybe 
                    if Dale and I squirted out a kid, 
                    we d get along better.

                          (Jules pulls her outside)
                    How come we always have to go 
                    outside when I m in trouble?


      The doorbell rings over and over.  A MOM opens the door to 
      REVEAL a very dishevelled Jules and Laurie.

                                  JULES
                    May I talk to your son?

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    32.



      As the Mom opens the door:

                                  MOM
                    Robbie, someone wants to talk to 
                    you.

      The door opens to REVEAL Robbie, in his boxers, his room 
      covered with Jules  signs like an adolescent whack palace.  

                                  JULES
                    Hi, Robbie.  You obviously know my 
                    name, this is my co-worker, Laurie.

                                  LAURIE
                    Hey, Robbie.  You re fast.

                                  ROBBIE
                    This is seriously not cool.

                                  MOM
                    He s never stolen things before.  
                    You know boys, his body s going 
                    through a lot of changes.

                                  ROBBIE
                    MOM!

                                  JULES
                    It s okay, I have a son of my own.

                                  ROBBIE 
                    Do you embarrass him like this? 

      Jules looks at this mortified kid and it hits her.  Hard.

                                  JULES
                    Yeah, I guess I do.  Sorry, Robbie.

      As Jules walks out with the Mom, Laurie gathers the signs 
      then looks at the sad kid.  She checks the door, then:

                                  LAURIE
                    Give me your e-mail address, I ll 
                    send you some pictures I took of 
                    her at the beach last summer.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules sits, thinking.  Tad comes downstairs, heading out.                                                                                    33.


                                  JULES 
                    Hey, before you go, I want you to 
                    know the other night was a one time 
                    deal.  The last thing I want to do 
                    is have my life make your life any 
                    more difficult.  I promise.  

                                  TAD
                          (relieved)
                    Thank you.
                        (a beat, then)
                    Ryan s picking me up. 

                                  JULES
                          (as he kisses her)
                    Remember, if there s any drinking 
                    and driving--

                                  TAD
                    Penis picture, I got it, Mom.

      And he s gone.  Jules pours two glasses of wine again.  She 
      looks out the side window to see Elle and Andy dancing in 
      their living room, a living image of what she doesn t have.  
      Jules sits down on her couch, again alone in her den. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules casually looks out the window to see that Tad is gone.

                                  JULES
                    He s gone.

      MATT STEPS OUT.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Take the wine upstairs and get 
                      undressed.  I ll make sure the door 
                    is locked.  

      Matt starts off, then stops.

                                  MATT
                    Do you want the lights on or off?

                                  JULES
                    No lights, I bought candles.  And 
                    Matthew, no more talking.

      As WE GO CLOSE ON Jules  hand locking the front door:

                                        END OF SHOW
