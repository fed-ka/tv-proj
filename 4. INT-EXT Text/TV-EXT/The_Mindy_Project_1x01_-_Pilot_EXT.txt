      We pan up the side of a brick dorm at Princeton University, 
      seeing young couples hooking up in different rooms. We land 
      on the window of a now 20-year-old Mira, sitting on her dorm 
      room bed, with piles of biology textbooks in front of her, 
      studying. She s also watching You ve Got Mail.

      Mira s roommate and best friend GWEN, walks into the room and 
      tosses her a box of Pop Tarts which Mira catches without 
      looking. 

                                  GWEN
                    Have you showered this week?

      Mira shakes her head solemnly, transfixed by the movie.  

                                  MIRA (V.O.)
                    And then, eventually, I had no time 
                    at all. 


      We now see Serbian girl smiling under a tent at a posh post-
      wedding dinner reception. She smiles. Perfect teeth.  

                                  MIRA (V.O.)
                    He dumped me, she moved in, he 
                    fixed her teeth. They got married 
                    last night. I don t think they 
                    thought I would actually go, so 
                    they invited me. But I did go. 

      We now see Mira, in her dress, sitting at a table with 
      various old people and foreigners. 

                                  MIRA (V.O.)
                    I was at the worst table - the 
                    Randoms. You know, where the old 
                      babysitters and childhood pen pals 
                    sit?

      Mira and an OLD HIPPIE LADY get wasted and are laughing 
      loudly.

                                  MIRA (V.O.)
                    So, me and Tom s old babysitter 
                    Bernice got wasted together. 

                                    BERNICE
                    Why would Tom break up with a 
                      thoughtful girl like you?

                                  MIRA
                    He wanted kids. 

                                    BERNICE
                    You don t want kids?

                                  MIRA
                    No, he wanted kids. Six of  em. He 
                    thought I was too old for that. 

                                    BERNICE
                    Six kids? What is he, in a cult?
                          (confiding)
                    He wet the bed until he was 10. 

                                  MIRA (V.O.)
                    And then, I felt like making a 
                    speech. 

      Mira is now at the microphone.    Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot1/9/12  6.


                                  MIRA
                    Some of you may know Tom and I used 
                    to date. So I have some pretty good 
                    stories of everyone s favorite 
                    glorified dentist.  

      People laugh with anticipation, including Tom and the bride. 
      We see Clayton, Dr. Shulman and his wife, and Jeremy are 
      there. 

                                  MIRA (CONT D)
                    Like the time he thought he had 
                    Lyme disease but it turned out to 
                    be a patch of dry skin on his 
                    stomach. 

      People laugh. 

                                  MIRA (CONT D)
                    Or how he always says  Oh, Larry  
                    when we watch Curb Your Enthusiasm, 
                    like he has a personal relationship 
                    with Larry David. 

      People love this. Brooks whispers to Dr. Shulman. 

                                  BROOKS
                    What s Curb Your Enthusiasm?

                                  DR. SHULMAN
                    Oy vey. 

                                  MIRA
                    Or the time he told me during sex 
                    that he wanted to marry me and make 
                    me pregnant with six babies. 

      People stop smiling. Brooks covers his eyes. Jeremy loves 
      this.

                                  MIRA (CONT D)
                    Which I really wanted too. But, 
                    well, that didn t end up happening. 
                      Obviously. Cuz here I am, sitting 
                    with a bunch of randoms at his 
                    wedding to the Serbian bagel girl. 
                            (whispering)
                    By the way, are we a hundred 
                    percent sure she s not a war 
                    criminal? 
                          (then, off their reaction)
                    Oh, get over yourselves. Like the 
                    thought didn t cross your mind.

                    So: to Tom and Bagel Girl. May you 
                    never run out of bagels.  

      Mira throws her wine glass down, shattering it. 

                                  MIRA (CONT D)
                    L Chaim! Peace. I m out. Tom wet 
                    the bed until he was ten!
                          (Mr. T.)
                    Huhn! 

      Mira leaves the stage, grabs a bottle of champagne from a 
      waiter s tray, walks out of the tent past the caterers, grabs 
      a bike, and begins to pedal and drink at the same time. She 
      bikes off.


      Mira is biking, wasted, and drinking in a residential area. 

                                  MIRA
                    I m Kate Hudson. I m Kate Hudson.

      She runs a red light, and narrowly misses a car.

                    Racist! 

      Mira careens into the driveway of a house. She looks at it. 

                                  MIRA (CONT D)
                    Tudor. Nice. 

      She speeds through the driveway and does not notice the bike 
      is riding straight toward a swimming pool. 

                                  MIRA (CONT D)
                    Oh shi--

      She can t stop and falls into the pool. Underwater, Mira 
      opens her eyes. She notices a Minnie Mouse toy at the bottom 
      of the pool. It is frowning at her.

                                  MINNIE MOUSE
                          (with contempt)

                    And when Minnie Mouse pointed out 
                    that even she had a long-term 
                      boyfriend, I just started to cry. 

      Mira is now crying underwater somehow. It s pitiful. 

                                  MIRA (V.O.)
                    This is not where I thought I d be.

                                            ACT ONE


      Mira is booking it down the street in her cocktail dress and 
      heels. She stops, yanks off her heels, and continues to run. 


      Mira runs in past people. They stare at her. *

                                  MIRA*
                    Excuse me! I m saving a life! Get *
                    out of my way!*


      Mira sits inside the backseat of a running cab. She is *
      praying aloud. *

                                  MIRA*
                    Dear Lord, please let this date be *
                    good. May he have the wealth of

                    The penis of Michael Fassbender.  

      The cab driver clicks the meter back on, impatiently. *

                                  MIRA (CONT D)*
                    I m going, I m going. *


      Mira runs out in her cocktail dress. 

                                  MIRA
                    Taxi!

      There are no taxis. 

                                  MIRA (CONT D)*
                    Dammit!*


      Mira books it down the street. She stops and takes off her 
      heels, sprinting. 

                                  MIRA*
                    Dammit!*


      Mira races in. She slides into the elevator. She hits her *
      shoes against the wall, annoyed. *


      Mira is operating. We see Brooks watching from the window of 
      the operation room.  Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot1/9/12  36.
