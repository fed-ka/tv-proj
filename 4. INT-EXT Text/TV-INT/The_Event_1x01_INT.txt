      TIGHT on the  FASTEN SEAT BELT  sign as it lights up.  
      Welcome to SkyAir Flight 514.  MOVE TO REVEAL Flight 
      Attendant MAUREEN DONOVAN (23, perky) standing near the 
      cockpit, speaking into the P.A. system.

                                    MAUREEN
                    At this time, please make sure your 
                    seat belts are fastened, your seats 
                    and tray tables are in the upright 
                      position...

      She continues the announcement O.S. as we start making our 
      way down the aisle towards the back of the plane.

      The cabin is half-full.  Nothing unusual about the 
      passengers.  People chatting, pulling out books or casually 
      flipping through worn-out copies of  Sky Mall  magazine.

      Two other FLIGHT ATTENDANTS (JAMES and CARRIE) make the last 
      cabin check, securing overhead bins and checking seat belts.

                                    MAUREEN (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    If you d like to get some shut-eye 
                    during our 5 hour and 7 minute 
                    flight to Los Angeles, please make 
                    sure you fasten your seat belt over 
                    your blanket so we don t have to 
                    wake you up during the flight...

      James reaches the back of the cabin.  He opens one of the 
      bathroom doors -- just a cursory part of the take-off safety 
      procedure.  Bathroom s empty.  He turns to the other 
      bathroom, flings the door open, and finds...

      SEAN WALKER, 26, handsome all-American guy, swimmer s build, 
      outgoing and charming.  Well, usually charming.  Right now, 
      not so much.                                                                                      2.

                                  JAMES
                    Sir, we re about to take off.

                                  SEAN
                    I m sorry.  I wasn t feeling well.

                      JAMESSEAN
      Can I get you any--No, I m fine now, thanks.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                          (walking away)
                    I m gonna go back to my seat.

      Sean walks down the aisle and SCANS THE CABIN, trying to pick 
      an empty seat.  As the plane taxies away from the gate, he 
      takes a quick glance at the terminal they re leaving.

      SEAN S POV, THROUGH WINDOW 

      Inside the terminal, FOUR OUT-OF-BREATH MEN regroup after an 
      intense but fruitless pursuit.  We can t hear them, but we 
      get a clear sense Sean is the one they re after.

      BACK TO SEAN

      -- as he continues down the aisle.  He passes a MAN in a 
      leather jacket reading Newsweek magazine.  The cover reads: 
       H1N1 Strikes Back.  Sean picks an aisle seat near the front.

      ON JAMES

      -- as he secures the bathroom door and straps himself into 
      his seat in the back galley. Camera slowly PANS OVER and 
      moves in on the bathroom door... and WOOSHES THROUGH IT.

      INSIDE THE AIRPLANE BATHROOM

      Camera SETTLES on a piece of BLUE FABRIC protruding from the 
      trash compartment.  A maintenance uniform.

      TIGHT ON SEAN IN THE CABIN

      He fastens his seat belt.  Click.  A bead of sweat rolls down 
      his forehead as the plane starts picking up speed.  He looks 
      out the window.

      SEAN S POV:

      A BLACK EXPLORER barrels down the service road parallel to 
      the runway, leaving a cloud of dust in its wake.

      BACK TO SEAN

      He doesn t flinch, seems to know what s happening.                                                                                      3.

      The overhead bin above him POPS OPEN.  Maureen swiftly 
      unstraps herself and takes the few steps to Sean s seat.  He 
      quickly adjusts his shirt, but not before we catch a flash of 
      the GUN concealed underneath it. 

      Maureen CLOSES THE OVERHEAD BIN just as we--

                                                              FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT
                                                            (11 DAYS EARLIER) TO:  

      TIGHT ON A SUITCASE

      -- as someone SMASHES IT SHUT, using their entire weight.

                                  LEILA
                    Done!  I knew I could make it fit.

      We PULL BACK to REVEAL LEILA GASIOROWSKI, 26, long brown 
      hair, tanned skin, beautiful smile.  She s hot.  Model hot.  
      And an MIT graduate.  Yes, some people do have it all.

      The suitcase sits on the bed.  Large, modern bedroom.

                                            SUPER:
                                          Atlanta, GA
                                      Eleven days earlier

      She locks the suitcase just as her mother KAREN (49, a former 
      fashion model who never made it big) emerges from the 
      bathroom with a small, empty travel bag.

                                  KAREN
                    (RE: bag)  So you don t need this?

                                  LEILA
                    No, I m good.

                                  KAREN
                    Leila, honey, you re not supposed 
                    to lock your suitcase.

                                  LEILA
                    Mom, if they really think my hair 
                    dryer is a bomb, I m sure they ll 
                    figure out a way to pick the locks.

      Leila s sister SAMANTHA (7, way too smart for her age) rushes 
      in and starts using Leila s bed as a trampoline. 

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Can I be your new roommate when you 
                    get back?                                                                                      4.

                                  LEILA
                    I don t know.  Can you pay half the 
                    rent?

                                  SAMANTHA
                    No, but I m nicer than Lexi was.

                                  KAREN
                    (RE: Lexi)  I still can t believe 
                    that girl just took off and left 
                    you hanging like that.
                          (to Samantha)
                    Sam, stop, you re gonna fall and 
                    hurt yourself.
                          (back to Leila)
                    If you need help with the rent...

      Samantha continues jumping on the bed, ignoring her mother.

                                  LEILA
                    Thanks, mom, but I ll be fine.  I 
                    can find someone else when we get 
                    back from the cruise.

                                  KAREN
                    I ll ask around at the office--
                          (snaps at Samantha)
                    Samantha, off, now!

      Off Samantha s indignant look as she steps off the bed...


      Modern, spacious upper-scale loft.  A couple of travel bags 
      sit by the front door.  Sean stands at the living room table, 
      jotting something down on a piece of paper.  Next to him is 
      MARK GASIOROWSKI, Leila s father, (50 s, affable, Marlboro 
      Man good looks.)  Sean hands the piece of paper over to Mark.

                                  SEAN
                    And this is the main line for the 
                    ship, just in case.  But they said 
                    we should have a cell signal most 
                    of the time.

                                  MARK
                    Great.  Don t worry, we ll try to 
                    leave you love birds alone this time.
                          (calling out to Leila)
                    You re gonna miss your flight!

                                  LEILA (O.S.)
                          (from upstairs)
                    Almost ready!

      Sean seems nervous.  Mark notices.                                                                                      5.

                                  MARK
                    Relax, I m kidding.  You guys have 
                    plenty of time. But you know her...

                                  SEAN
                    Oh, no, yeah, I know.  I... 
                      There s...  I was just thinking...

      Sean looks over his shoulder to make sure the girls aren t 
      coming down the staircase yet.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    I know that this is probably not 
                    the best time to do this.  I kept 
                    delaying it and, well, now, it s... 
                    now and...  This whole surprise 
                    trip, the reason is...  And I know 
                    this is completely old-fashioned, 
                    but I know how much you love your 
                    daughter -- obviously -- and I know 
                    how much she means to you and--

                                  MARK
                    Sean.

                                  SEAN
                    Yes?

                                  MARK
                    You have my blessings.

                                  SEAN
                    I do?

                                  MARK
                    You ll take good care of her, love 
                    her, cherish her, all that good 
                    stuff, right?

                                  SEAN
                    Yes.  Yes, of course.

                                  MARK
                    Okay.  Then you have my blessings.

      Sean reaches out to shake his hand but Mark goes for a hug.

                                  SEAN
                          (stunned)
                    Okay, that was easier than I thought.

                                  MARK
                    Of course if you hurt her in any 
                    way, I will have to kill you.                                                                                      6.

                                  SEAN
                      I understand.

      Leila hurries down the stairs with her suitcase.

                                  LEILA
                    I m coming, I m coming!


      The PLANE S ENGINES ROAR LOUDLY as the aircraft lifts off.  
      Sean, on edge, still looking out the window.

      SEAN S POV

      The Explorer gets ahead of the plane, then SWERVES ONTO THE 
      RUNWAY into an intercept course before driving out of view.  
      Sean BRACES FOR IMPACT... but nothing happens.  No collision, 
      no shock. And no one else seems to have noticed the Explorer.

      He lets out a deep breath.  No more dithering.  He has to 
      act.  He slips the gun out from under his shirt.  Cocks it.

      He unbuckles his seat belt and rushes towards the cockpit.  
      Camera STAYS ON HIS SEAT. The REST OF THE SCENE PLAYS OUT OS. 

                                    MAUREEN (O.S.)
                    Sir, please return to--

      Loud BANGING against a door.

                                  PASSENGER (O.S.)
                    He has a gun!

      SCREAMS... then we...

                                                              SHOCK CUT TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                      8.

                                        ACT TWO

      SUPER OVER BLACK...

                                          SIMON LEE

                                                                  WHITE FLASH TO:


      TIGHT ON A RED LIGHT

      We PAN/TILT TO REVEAL several cars waiting for the light to 
      turn green.  Palm trees, bright Art Deco buildings, glass 
      skyscrapers slashing through the bright blue sky.

      The DRIVER of an old Volvo taps his steering wheel to the 
      beat of his blaring radio.  The light finally turns green.  
      The man moves into first gear, starts pulling forward when--

      A BLACK SUV

      -- careens through the intersection, ignoring the red light  
      and BLASTING ITS HORN.  The stunned Volvo driver smashes on 
      his brakes.  THE SUV swerves to avoid the collision and 
      speeds down the street.

      INSIDE THE SUV

      SIMON LEE, mid-30 s, athletic, rugged.  Hasn t shaved in a 
      couple of days.  Hasn t had time.  He s a man on a mission 
      and he s running out of time.  

                                  SIMON
                          (into his cell phone)
                    There is no time.  You need to 
                    ground that plane right now, you 
                      understand?

                OPERATOR (V.O.)SIMON*
        (on the phone)And do not put me on hold 
      I m gonna have to put you on again.
      hold.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Hello?

       The Girl from Ipanema  starts playing on the other end.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Oh, come on!

      He SMACKS his phone against the steering wheel.  Then takes a 
      deep breath, glances at the dashboard clock.

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:                                                                                      9.


      CU on a DIGITAL CLOCK.  4:50pm.  We PULL BACK TO REVEAL we 
      are in the Miami International control tower.  Rows of AIR 
      CONTROLLERS at their consoles.  FRED DAVIS, a plump fifty-
      year old with thick glasses, PICKS UP THE PHONE.

                                  DAVIS
                    Hello, this is Fred Davis.

                                  SIMON
                    Are you the man in charge?

                                  DAVIS
                    That s me.

                                  SIMON
                    Okay, listen to me carefully, Fred.  
                    I need you to ground SkyAir 514.  
                    Do not let it take off.

                                  DAVIS
                    What?  On what basis?  Who is this?

                                  SIMON
                    Who I am doesn t matter.  Just stop 
                    that plane or many people will die.

      Davis looks out the window, down at a Boeing 737 maneuvering 
      onto the runway.

      BACK TO DAVIS

                                  DAVIS
                    If this is a joke, you re--

                                  SIMON
                    Okay, Fred, we don t have time for 
                    this.  What would it take for you 
                    to stop the plane?  Just tell me.

                        DAVISSIMON*
      Sir--A bomb threat?  Would that do 
                                                  it?                                                                                    10.

                                  DAVIS
                    I can t just--

                                  SIMON
                    Okay, fine!  There s a bomb on 
                    flight 514.

      Davis knows it s probably not true and clearly doesn t want 
      to have to deal with it.  But now he has no choice.

                                  DAVIS
                    Dammit.

                                  SIMON
                    Did you hear me?

                                  DAVIS
                    Yes, yes.  I heard you.

                                                                      END INTERCUT.

      ON THE SUV 

      -- as it guns through another red light.  Another car comes 
      zipping from the other direction.

      Simon notices it at the last second, LEANS ON HIS HORN as we--

                                                              FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT
                                                            (13 MONTHS EARLIER) TO:


      The CAR HORN turns into the BUZZER of a security door.  The 
      heavy double-door slides open.  A gust of freezing air whirls 
      into the large corridor of what appears to be a military 
      facility.  Steel, bare walls.

      Simon and a FEMALE AGENT (EVA, 29) quickly usher in their 
      handcuffed prisoner (KATHRYN, 40 s, harsh).  Eva motions the 
      TWO ARMED SOLDIERS flanking the entrance to reseal the hatch.

                                  EVA
                    Close it!  Close it!

      The door closes behind them with a woosh at is seals shut.

                                            SUPER:
                            Mount Inostranka Facility, Alaska
                                  Thirteen months earlier

                                  EVA (CONT D)
                    Don t wanna have to freeze my ass 
                    longer than I have to.                                                                                    11.

                                    KATHRYN
                    At least you don t have to live 
                    here.

      GENERAL MULLENDORE (50 s, stately) steps in to greet them.

                                    GENERAL MULLENDORE
                      Kathryn...  I knew we d find you 
                    sooner or later.

                                    KATHRYN
                            (determined)
                    Don t get excited, General.  I won t 
                    be here long.  I want to work out a 
                    deal.

      Mullendore shoots Simon and Eva a questioning look.

                                  SIMON
                    She says she has  information. 

                                    GENERAL MULLENDORE
                      Really?...  Okay.  Get her to 
                    medical for a full check up, then 
                    get her ready for a debriefing.

      Off an intrigued Mullendore...


      Large room.  White brick walls, bare.  One side is a floor to 
      ceiling bullet-proof window beyond which is a NONDESCRIPT 
      SNOWY LANDSCAPE.  We will later discover that the Facility s 
      windows are like two-way mirrors.  No one can look in from 
      the outside.

      NEIL McMANN (mid-40 s, subdued charisma, calm and controlled) 
      sits at the table in the center of the otherwise empty 
      interview room.  Simon enters.  A SOLDIER starts following 
      him inside but Simon turns him away.

                                  SIMON
                    I ll be fine.

      The soldier nods, steps back out into the hallway.  Neil and 
      Simon stare silently at each other as the door slides shut.

                                  NEIL
                    It s been a while.  I d say I m 
                    happy to see you, but you seem to 
                    always be the bearer of bad news.

      Simon lifts a finger to his lips, signaling Neil to stay 
      silent.  He pulls out a pen-shaped device, flips it on.  The 
      device comes on with a LOW BUZZ.  Simon sits down with Neil.                                                                                    12.

                                  SIMON
                    Never know if they re listening.
                          (now speaking freely)
                    We recaptured Kathryn. Just dropping 
                    her off.  That s why I m here.

                                  NEIL
                    Kathryn?  After all this time...    

                                  SIMON
                    Yeah.  She s not exactly thrilled 
                    about being back.  And we may have 
                      a problem.  She s gonna talk to 
                    General Mullendore.  She thinks she 
                    can buy her freedom back, trade it 
                    for information.

                                  NEIL
                    What kind of information?

      Heavy beat as Simon stares at Neil intently.  Neil already 
      knows the answer to his question.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    She can t.

                                  SIMON
                    She s going to.

                                  NEIL
                          (stern)
                    You have to convince her to change 
                    her mind...  Whatever it takes.

      Simon looks down, awkward.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    What is it?

                                  SIMON
                          (tentative)
                    Sir, some of us think that maybe... 
                    they should know.  Or that maybe we 
                    should be prepared to abort.

                                  NEIL
                      Extremists.  No, absolutely not.

                                  SIMON
                    Don t you think we should at least 
                    warn them?  So they can prepare?  
                    There s a new president in the 
                    White House. Martinez.  He s a good 
                    man.  I think he would help us.                                                                                    13.

                                  NEIL
                      Presidents haven t helped us 
                    before.  And if he is a good man, 
                      Mullendore and the others won t let 
                    him find out about this place.

                                  SIMON
                    I ll make sure he finds out.

                                  NEIL
                          (scrutinizing stare)
                    You still have faith in them.  After 
                      everything you ve seen, you still 
                    have faith in them.
                          (then, firm)
                    Simon, we have to protect ourselves 
                    if we want to survive.  That s what 
                    they would do if they found out 
                    about what s coming.  You are my 
                    conduit to the outside.  I need you 
                    to reason with the others on my 
                    behalf...  Can I count on you?

      Simon dithers for a moment, then, like a good soldier...

                                  SIMON
                    Yes, sir.

      PRE-LAP TRAFFIC NOISE and HONKING HORNS.

                                                  END FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT TO:


      Simon, still on the phone with the control tower, is now 
      SWERVING through freeway traffic.  Cars move out of his way, 
      honking angrily.

                                  SIMON
                    For god s sake, Fred, just do it!

      INTERCUT WITH CONTROL TOWER

                                  DAVIS
                    Okay, fine.  Stay on the line.

      Davis looks up at the controllers in the room.

                                  DAVIS (CONT'D)
                          (calling out)
                    Who s got SkyAir 514?

                                  KRAMER
                    Right here, boss.  I have SkyAir

                                  DAVIS
                    Bring her back to the gate.

                                  KRAMER
                    Yes, sir.
                          (into headset)

                    so if you don t--

                                  SIMON
                    No, you re not.

                                  KRAMER
                          (calling out Davis)
                    Sir, SkyAir 514 has gone norco.  
                    I m getting no response.

                                  DAVIS
                    What?

      Davis walks to the window, looks down at the runway.  RACK 
      FOCUS TO THE BOEING maneuvering into take off position. 

                                  DAVIS (CONT D)
                          (tensing up, to Simon)
                    We lost radio contact.  What s 
                    going on?                                                                                    15.


                                  SIMON
                    Dammit!  It s too late.

      He hangs up his cell phone, throws it on the passenger seat.

      He SWERVES through two lanes and barely makes it to the exit 
      ramp, causing three cars behind him to fishtail and CRASH 
      into each other.

      The SUV speeds down the ramp and blazes through the red 
      light, shooting onto a surface street.

                                  KRAMER (PRE-LAP)
                    They switched off their 
                      transponder!


      Davis checks Kramer s radar screen. The flight s tag is gone.

                                  DAVIS
                    What the hell are they doing?  Try 
                    calling them on guard.

                                  OTHER AIR CONTROLLER (O.S.)
                    Sir!  They re taking off!

      Filled with dread, Davis looks up...

      DAVIS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW

      The aircraft is on the move, SPEEDING DOWN THE RUNWAY.

                                  DAVIS
                    Oh fu--

      ALL radar screens in the tower suddenly FLICKER in unison, 
      then start flashing a  REBOOT  message.  Instant pandemonium.

                                  KRAMER
                    Radars are down!  They re all down!

                                  DAVIS
                    Get the FAA on the phone and start 
                    the emergency protocol.


      Simon s SUV skids off the road, CRASHES through a chain-link 
      fence, and ends up on a service road parallel to the runway.                                                                                    16.

      We catch a SHORT GLIMPSE OF SEAN behind one of the aircraft 
      windows, watching the SUV.


      TIGHT ON SEAN

      A bead of sweat rolls down his temple.  He takes a deep 
      breath... then gets up and rushes up towards the cockpit.

      Passengers are perplexed.  What is this man doing???

      He reaches the cockpit door and starts POUNDING on it.  
      Without flinching, Maureen unstraps herself and approaches 
      him cautiously.

                                    MAUREEN
                    Sir, please return to--

      Sean USES HIS GUN to bang against the cockpit door.

                                  PASSENGER
                    He has a gun!

      PANIC and SCREAMS immediately fill the cabin.  The other two 
      flight attendants rush to Maureen s rescue from the tail.

                      MAUREENSEAN
      Sir, please!(yelling, to pilot)
                                                  Open the door!  We need to 
                                                  talk.  You don t have to do 
                                                  this!

      Sean slams the gun against the cockpit door again -- bam! 
      bam! bam!  Some of the passengers start sobbing... praying...

                                  SEAN
                          (yelling, to pilot)
                    You and I, together, we can figure 
                    this out... Answer me!!!

                                    MAUREEN
                    They can t hear you through the 
                    door.

      TWO MALE PASSENGERS get up and join the two flight attendants 
      rushing towards the cockpit.  Sean points his gun at them.  
      They freeze.                                                                                    18.

                                  SEAN
                    Stay back.  Back!  I don t wanna 
                    use this gun but I will if I have 
                    to, so... back up!  And sit down!

      No choice.  They comply and retreat back to their seats.  

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                          (to Maureen)
                    Can you open it?

      She shakes her head apologetically and lies.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    How do I talk to the pilot?

      She points at the phone on the wall.

                                    MAUREEN
                    The interphone.  Green button.

      Sean grabs the phone and presses the green button.

                                  SEAN
                          (into phone)
                    Listen, I know what you re doing.  
                    Just let me in and we ll figure out 
                    something else.  Another way...  I 
                    can t let you do this!

                                  TAYLOR (O.S.)
                    You read my thoughts.  Drop the gun 
                    and put your hands up.

      Standing in the aisle, just a few feet away is DAN TAYLOR, 
      the man in the leather jacket from Act One, who has traded 
      his Newsweek for a gun now pointed at Sean.  COLLECTIVE GASP.

                                  TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                    Kid, I m an air marshal, and I m 
                    not gonna tell you twice.  You drop 
                    the gun and put your hands up now 
                    or I will shoot you.

                                  SEAN
                    Listen, I know how this looks but--

      Taylor means business.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Do it!

      Sean starts kneeling down to drop his gun... reaching his arm 
      down just as we--                                                                                    19.



                                                              FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT 
                                                            (8 DAYS EARLIER) TO:   

      TIGHT ON SEAN S ARM

      ... as he reaches down towards Leila, trying to help her up 
      to the next grip of the tall outdoor climbing wall.

                                  SEAN
                    Do it!  Come on, I know you can.

      The climbing wall sits on the top deck of a CRUISE SHIP 
      anchored near an exotic island.

                                            SUPER:
                                  Freeport, Grand Bahama
                                      Eight days earlier

      Clear, turquoise water.  Sun.  Tourists everywhere.  Good 
      times all around.

                                  LEILA
                    I can t.  My fingers are hurting.  
                    Sean, I can t.

                                  SEAN
                    Yes, you can, Leila, just grab my 
                    hand.

      She reaches her hand up... pushing herself up with all her 
      strength... almost touches Sean s fingers... then...

      She suddenly SLIPS, lets out a STARTLED SCREAM as she drops 
      down a few feet.  Sean chuckles as he watches her dangling at 
      the end of the safety rope.  She sighs.

                                  LEILA
                    I told you I couldn t.  My hands 
                    are too sweaty.

                                  SEAN
                    Okay, well, try again!  C mon.

      With the agility of a cat, he quickly climbs up the few feet 
      that separate him from the top.

                                  LEILA
                    I don t think so.

                                  SEAN
                    I m not coming down til you get up 
                    here.                                                                                    20.

      Leila rolls her eyes.  She sighs.  She knows he means it.  

                                  LEILA
                    Okay, all right.  Fine.

      She nods at the SPOTTER below and is about to resume her 
      climb when Sean notices a commotion on a lower deck.

      SEAN S POV

      A GROUP OF PANICKED PASSENGERS gathers around the railing, 
      looking down at the water below.  GREG (mid-20 s, frat-boy 
      looks, and a CAST on his left arm) throws a lifesaver over 
      the railing, screaming for help.

                                  GREG
                    Somebody help!

      BACK ON SEAN

      -- as he instinctively KICKS INTO HIGH GEAR.  He rappels down 
      the climbing wall, passing Leila on the way down.

                                  LEILA
                    What s going on?

      He reaches the bottom of the wall, unhooks his safety line 
      and sprints towards the lower deck.

      LOWER DECK 

      Greg is begging the SHIP SECURITY OFFICER who just arrived.

                                  GREG
                    My girlfriend fell.  She s 
                    drowning!  Do something!

      POV SHOT ON THE GIRLFRIEND (VICKY)

      -- FLAILING her arms around, trying to keep her head above 
      water.  The life jacket landed too far away to be helpful.

      BACK ON DECK

                SECURITY OFFICERGREG
          (into his radio)Do something!  She s 
      Man overboard, deck 2B, aft.drowning!

                                  SECURITY OFFICER (CONT D)
                    We re radioing the Coast Guard.

                                  GREG
                    She s not gonna make it that long!                                                                                    21.

                                  SECURITY OFFICER
                    Sir, I m sorry, but there s nothing 
                    we can do from up here.

      Sean RUSHES DOWN THE STAIRS from the upper deck, pushes his 
      way through the crowd, reaches the railing and looks down.

      SEAN S POV

      -- as Vicky struggles to stay afloat.

      BACK ON SEAN

      -- quickly removing his shoes.  The security officer notices.

                                  SECURITY OFFICER (CONT D)
                    You can t jump.  She s lucky she s 
                    alive.  Do you know how high we--

      Sean has already climbed over the railing, and before the 
      security officer can finish his sentence...  Sean DIVES 
      gracefully towards the turquoise water below.

      SPLASH!

      -- as he enters the water.

      ON VICKY

      -- fighting to stay above water.  

      FROM HER POV

      -- we see Sean approaching, still far but getting closer...  
      before we are pulled under water. Waves, bubbles, confusion.

      Then a GASP OF AIR as Vicky resurfaces once again, running 
      out of air and out of time. Sean is SWIMMING FAST toward her.

      ON GREG

      -- watching from behind the railing.  Leila joins him and the 
      growing crowd of ONLOOKERS.

      ON SEAN

      -- as he finally reaches Vicky.  She GRABS ON to him but 
      continues THRASHING around, dragging him down with her.

                                  SEAN
                    You re gonna be fine, just...  Stay 
                    still or we re both gonna drown.

      She finally stops fighting back, lets Sean hold her.                                                                                    22.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    Okay.  You re gonna be okay....

      A beat.  He starts swimming back, pulling her gently...

                                  VICKY (PRE-LAP)
                    I swear I can swim.  I don t know 
                    what happened.  I just freaked.


      Mark is on the cordless.  Karen and Samantha clear the table. 
      A SMALL TV on the kitchen counter, tuned in to MSNBC.

                                  MARK
                    Hey, Pumpkin!

                                  LEILA
                          (loud)
                    Hey, Dad.

      Hard to hear with the music and the crowd, and the TV.

                                  MARK
                    Where are you?

                                  LEILA
                    Oh, we re at this club in Nassau.

                                  MARK
                    Are you guys having a good time?

                                  LEILA
                    We re having a great time.
                          (noticing a VOICE in b.g.)
                    Who else is there?

      Mark looks around, settles on THE TELEVISION, showing B-ROLL 
      of PRESIDENT ELIAS MARTINEZ (Hispanic, late 40 s, poised) 
      giving a speech at the White House.

                                  REPORTER (O.S., ON TV)
                    -- and President Martinez announced 
                    the expansion of the free clinic 
                    program [audio drifts off...]

                                  MARK
                    Oh, no one, it s just the TV.  
                          (to Samantha)
                    Shorty, can you turn it down?

      Samantha grabs the remote and MUTES THE TV.

                                  MARK (CONT D)
                          (to Leila)
                    We haven t heard from you in a 
                    couple of days, so...  your mom and 
                    I just wanted to check in.

                                  KAREN
                          (in b.g.)
                    Hi, Sweetie!

                                  MARK
                    Your mom says hi.  How s Sean?                                                                                    26.

      Leila SPOTS a distraught SEAN who s been dragged to the other 
      side of the pool.  Vicky waves at her excitedly, oblivious as 
      she almost bumps a tray out of the hands of a passing 
      WAITRESS.  Sean mouths  help. 

                                  LEILA
                          (muffling a laugh)
                    He s good. Everything s really 
                    good.  Dad, it s really hard to 
                    hear with the music.  Can I call 
                    you back tomorrow?

                                  MARK
                    Sure.  Let s do that.

                                  LEILA
                    Tell Mom and Shorty I said good hi.

                                  MARK
                    I will.  Love you, Pumpkin.

                                  LEILA
                    Love you too, dad.

                                                                      END INTERCUT.


      Suddenly all SILENT AND QUIET.  Sean and Leila stroll out of 
      the elevator and down the corridor towards their cabin.  Very 
      tipsy, holding hands.

                                  LEILA
                    Were they beginning to get on your 
                    nerves too, or was it just me?

                                  SEAN
                    Yeah, they re a little bit 
                    annoying.  In a fun kind of way.

                                  LEILA
                    And oh my god, they can drink!

      Leila accidentally bumps into a MAN whose face we don t see.

                LEILA (CONT D)SEAN
      I m so sorry!Woah, careful, babe!

                                  MAN
                    No problem.

                                  SEAN
                    Leil , how many drinks did you have?                                                                                    27.

                                  LEILA
                    A few...  Speaking of which, I m 
                    not convinced Vicky was totally 
                    sober when you fished her out.  
                    It s all beginning to make sense.

      She looks up at the room numbers... counting...

                LEILA (CONT D)SEAN
          (tipsy loud)Baby, not so loud!  People 
      Okay, 5311...  5312are sleeping.

                                  LEILA (CONT D)
                            (whispering)
                    Sorry...  5313...

      They reach the last door at the end of the corridor.

                                  LEILA (CONT'D)
                    5314!  This is us, right?

                                  SEAN
                          (amused)
                    Yes, this is us.

      She pulls the KEY CARD out of her pocket and slides it into 
      the electronic lock.  Beep.  Red light.

      She tries it again... and... again.  Beep.  Denied.

                                  LEILA
                    It s not working.

                                  SEAN
                    Let me try.

      Sean takes the card out of her hand, flips it, and slides it 
      into the lock.  Beep beep.  Green light.  The door unlocks.


      Sean and Leila STUMBLE into the large suite, kissing 
      passionately.  They almost knock one of their matching 
      MacBooks off a small desk.  Leila LOSES HER BALANCE, but Sean 
      catches her.  She CRACKS UP, clearly drunk.  Then realizes...

                                  LEILA
                    Yeah, I think I need a little air.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      Taylor COCKS HIS GUN, aiming at Sean.                                                                                    29.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Drop the gun.  Now!

      Sean realizes the air marshal won t ask twice.

                                  TAYLOR (CONT D)
                    Slowly.

      Sean drops the gun down on the floor, puts his hands up.  
      Taylor pulls flexicuffs out of his jacket pocket.

                                  SEAN
                    Listen, man, you can arrest me all 
                    you want when this is over, but 
                    right now we have to get into the 
                    cockpit.  Me, or you, I don t care!

                                  TAYLOR
                          (to Maureen)
                    Tell the captain to turn around.

      Maureen nods and goes for the interphone.

                                  TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                          (to Sean)
                    Now turn around and slowly bring 
                    your hands down behind your back.

      BANG!

      Gunshot.  A few stunned SCREAMS.  Then an unsettling SILENCE 
      of CONFUSED REALIZATION takes over the cabin.  Everyone 
      stares puzzlingly at the cockpit door.

      The shot came from inside the cockpit.

                                  TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                          (lowering his gun)
                    What the hell?

      The plane suddenly DROPS AND BANKS, throwing everyone who is 
      standing to the ground.  More screams as we--

                                                            SHOCK CUT TO BLACK. 


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    30.

                                        ACT FOUR

      SUPER OVER BLACK...

                                PRESIDENT ELIAS MARTINEZ

                                                                  WHITE FLASH TO:


      Paula and her crew walk by the conference room where the 
      President and his advisors are gathered just as an AGENT 
      shuts the door.


      Paula is chatting with FOUR PEOPLE (THREE MEN, ONE WOMAN, 
      whose faces we don t see) dressed in suits, sitting in the 
      leather sofa and chairs across from her, as her crew sets up 
      for the interview.

                                  PAULA
                    We ll run this during the special 
                    after the press conference.  This 
                    is a historic moment!  For all of 
                    us.  
                          (then, to one of the men)
                    Can you believe this is actually 
                      happening, after all this time?

      We MOVE to REVEAL the man she s talking to is NEIL McMANN.

                                  NEIL
                    Well, we re not free yet.

      He looks up at the TWO AGENTS guarding the door.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    But thank you, Paula.  Your 
                      persistence has definitely helped 
                    our cause.


      President Martinez sits at the end of a large oak table in a 
      large dining room turned conference room.  Also at the table 
      are General Mullendore, Director Sterling, Vice President 
      Jarvis, and a few other OFFICIALS.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    So, this is...  What?  An 
                      intervention?                                                                                    33.

      Uncomfortable shifting and throat clearing.  Sterling finally 
      breaks the silence with inappropriate aplomb.

                                  STERLING
                    Mr. President, with all due respect, 
                    we don t have time for niceties 
                    anymore.  You re making a mistake.  
                    Everyone here agrees.

                                  JARVIS
                    Eli, we just want to... strongly 
                    urge you to reconsider.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                      Gentlemen, we ve already had this 
                      discussion.  This is bigger than 
                    us.  These people will be released 
                    and granted asylum if they want it.  
                    We are closing The Facility.  And I 
                    am not changing my mind.  In two 
                    hours, I am gonna go out there and 
                    I m going to tell the American 
                    people the truth.

                                  STERLING
                    Sir, this is all fine and noble, 
                    but we need to be realistic.  It s 
                    your duty to protect this country.  
                    If you let them out, you ll be 
                    putting the American people in 
                    danger.  Look at the latest 
                    reports, for god s sake.  

                                  JARVIS
                          (cuts in, disapprovingly)
                    Sterling!

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Those reports are nothing but 
                      conjectures and speculations.  The 
                    things you ve done to these 
                    people...  And they may not be 
                      Americans, but we are, god dammit.  
                    We re the ones who abused them and 
                    who ve been detaining them 
                      illegally, and that s not what this 
                    country is about.  Not anymore.

                                  STERLING
                    Then at least give us more time to 
                    analyze all this new information.  
                    How can we reassure the public if 
                    we don t have answers?

      A beat.  Martinez is still listening...  and pondering...                                                                                    34.

                                  JARVIS
                    There s still time to cancel the 
                    press conference.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Paula Dixon threatened to expose 
                    all of it three months ago, and we 
                    were lucky she agreed to wait until 
                    now in exchange for exclusive 
                    access.  But I know her, and she s 
                    gonna go public today, with or 
                    without us.

                                  STERLING
                    I m sure we can figure out a way to  
                    convince her.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    What?  You re gonna ship her off to 
                    Alaska too?  Guys, wake up.  The 
                      information is already out there.  
                    Even if I agreed, it s too late.

                                  STERLING
                    Fine, let the public find out.  But 
                    don t let them out.  It s too risky.

                                    GENERAL MULLENDORE
                    Sir, I agree with Director Sterling.  
                    We should keep them at The Facility 
                    at least for a while longer.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Those people have suffered enough.  
                    No.  This ends today.

      Clearly not the answer the others wanted to hear.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ (CONT D)
                          (getting up)
                    Now if you ll excuse me.  My kids 
                    are having a birthday.  I ll see 
                    you at the press conference.

      He OPENS THE DOOR as we--

                                                              FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT
                                                            (13 MONTHS EARLIER) TO:


      Martinez slides into the limo next to Christina.  The door 
      closes, sealing out the crowd noise.  The car drives away.

                                  CHRISTINA
                          (kicks off her shoes)
                    Ugh, these shoes are killing me!

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    What did you think of the show?  I 
                    thought it was pretty good.

      A phone suddenly starts RINGING.  Martinez pulls a small 
      phone out of his pocket.  It s off.  He looks up at Christina 
      questioningly as she pulls her own phone out of her purse.

                                  CHRISTINA
                    It s not mine either.

      Puzzled, President Martinez listens to the ring... and tracks 
      it down to an I-Phone, hidden in one of the storage 
        compartments in the side of the door.  The phone goes silent 
      just as he grabs it.  Martinez frowns as he discovers the 
      MESSAGE displayed on the screen:  From: Unknown User.  
      Request Top Secret Highest Clearance Dossier: INOSTRANKA.  

                                                                              CUT TO:

      -- where Simon puts away his own phone, looks up as the 
        Presidential limo drives away...


      TIGHT ON A RED FOLDER

      -- marked  TOP SECRET: INOSTRANKA , as it lands heavily on a 
      coffee table.

      WIDE to REVEAL President Martinez, visibly angry, pacing 
      behind the Resolute desk.  Sterling stands in the middle of 
      the room.                                                                                    36.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Did it just slip your mind?  For 
                    god s sake, Blake, when were you 
                    planning to tell me about this?

      Sterling stares, doesn t answer, but his silence says it all.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ (CONT D)
                          (fuming)
                    You were just gonna keep running 
                    this without my knowledge?

                                  STERLING
                    Plausible deniability, sir.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    That s your excuse?!

                                  STERLING
                      Information regarding the Mount 
                      Inostranka Facility has always been 
                    on a need-to-know basis.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    I m the President of the United 
                    States.  I need to know.

                                  STERLING
                      I determined The Facility to be an 
                      unnecessary distraction that would 
                    pull you away from more pressing 
                    issues.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Oh, just... Blake, just cut the 
                    crap, all right?
                          (beat)
                    Did the previous administration 
                    know about this?

                                  STERLING
                    Only the Vice President.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Of course.  It figures.
                          (then)
                    So it s true?  It s all true?

      Sterling nods silently.  A slew of emotions hits Martinez.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ (CONT D)
                    This is... unbelievable.
                          (grabs the file)
                    How many of them are there?  How 
                    many prisoners?                                                                                    37.

                          (reading the file)
                    Whatever.   Detainees.   Who get 
                    tortured.  How many?

                                  STERLING
                      Ninety-seven.

                                  STERLING
                    ... Seventeen.

      Martinez stares, waiting for an explanation that Sterling 
      would rather not give.  But he clearly has no choice...

                                  STERLING (CONT D)
                    We recaptured one of them last week, 
                    but she tried to escape again, 
                    assaulted one of our agents...  The 
                    agent acted in self-defense...

      We assume he is referring to Kathryn and something that led 
      to her demise after her return to the base.  Martinez shakes 
      his head... and lets out a TENSE SIGH, puts on his glasses

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    No, you may not.
                          (then, stern, bewildered)
                    This is... I mean, I don t even 
                    know how to feel.

                    I want to go there.  I want to meet 
                    them.  And this guy...

      Martinez pulls a PHOTOGRAPH OF NEIL out of the folder.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ (CONT D)
                    Neil McMann.  He s their leader?                                                                                    38.

      Off Sterling as he reluctantly acquiesces...

      PRE-LAP sound of slow motion helicopter blades...

                                  STERLING
                    Welcome to Mount Inostranka...  
                     The Facility. 

      Off President Martinez, genuinely stunned and excited...                                                                                    39.

                                    GENERAL MULLENDORE (PRE-LAP)
                    I ve assembled all the detainees in 
                    the mess hall...


      Mullendore leads President Martinez and his entourage 
      (Sterling, Simon and Eva) into the bowels of the facility.  
      They pass a variety of people -- MILITARY PERSONNEL 
      (including a couple of ARMED GUARDS on patrol), SCIENTISTS in 
      lab coats, and a handful of CIVILIANS. 

                                    GENERAL MULLENDORE
                    ... as you said you wanted to 
                    address them as a group.  And I ve 
                    set up a meeting room for you to 
                    sit down with McMann.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    I want a tour of the entire 
                    facility.


      They reach the end of a corridor that opens up on a gangway 
      overlooking the large mess hall.  Several ARMED SOLDIERS 
      guard the hallway, gangway, and stairs.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    And I want to see their living 
                    quarters.

                                    GENERAL MULLENDORE
                      Absolutely, Mr. President.

      Sterling and Mullendore trade a concerned look.

      They reach the edge of the gangway.  Martinez looks down at 
      the CROWD gathered below.  ADULT MEN AND WOMEN, most of them 
      look to be in their mid-30 s, some younger, some older, of 
      all races.

      We only get a GLIMPSE AT THE CROWD -- just enough for us to 
      register that they look like regular people.  Who are they?

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    You ve kept these people locked in 
                    here all these years?

      Guilty silence from Mullendore and Sterling.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    40.

      BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS

      -- as Martinez approaches the group.  Conversations stop as 
      the detainees notice his presence.  Neil emerges from the 
      crowd, steps up to Martinez, and reaches his hand out.

                                  NEIL
                    Mr. President, my name is Neil 
                    McMann.

      ON SIMON

      -- standing a few feet away, watching intently.

      Martinez starts EXTENDING HIS HAND towards Neil as we--

                                                  END FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT TO:


      MARTINEZ is SHAKING HANDS with Neil in the lounge.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    You sure you re ready to do this?

                                  NEIL
                    We ve been ready for a long time.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                          (nods, reassuringly)
                    Well, your time has come, my friend.
                          (then, turns to his aide)
                    So, are we ready?  We re ready 
                    here.  Rachel?

                                  RACHEL
                    Almost.  We re getting the Vice 
                      President.

      Paula walks up to Neil and President Martinez.

                                  PAULA
                    Mr. President, how was the birthday 
                    party?

                                  RACHEL
                          (into her comm-link)
                    I need a lock on the Vice 
                      President.

                                  VOICE
                          (filtered, on comm-link)
                    The Vice President left an hour ago 
                    with Director Sterling and General 
                      Mullendore.                                                                                    41.

                                  RACHEL
                    What?  No!  We need him at the 
                    press conference.  Right now.

                                  VOICE
                    Do you want me to patch you through 
                    to his security detail?

      An ALARM suddenly starts BLARING throughout the building, 
        interrupting Rachel s conversation.  The lounge doors fly 
      open and FOUR SECRET SERVICE AGENTS burst in.

                                  AGENT #1
                    Mr. President, we have to evacuate.

      The agents grab him and start ushering him out of the lounge

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    What s going on?

                                  AGENT #1
                    We have to go now.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Neil!  You re coming with us.
                          (to Agent #1)
                    He s coming or I m not leaving.

      Agent #1 nods at ANOTHER AGENT, who immediately grabs Neil s 
      arm and forces him to join them before he can protest.  
      CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as they leave Rachel and Paula behind.


      The agents lead Martinez and Neil through the CROWDED 
      HALLWAYS and the CHAOS of the ongoing evacuation.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    Where is Christina?  And the twins?

                                  AGENT #1
                    They re boarding Marine One.

                                  PRESIDENT MARTINEZ
                    What is going on?

                                  AGENT #1
                    We ve lost radar capability.  Our 
                    whole radar system is down.


      TIGHT ON A MIRROR

      -- as we hear WATER RUNNING.

      Mark stands up, comes into frame.  He just splashed water on 
      his face.  Mark is always all smiles.  But not today.  Today 
      he looks pale.  Tired.  It s been a very long week.

      He stands in front of the sink as the water keeps running.  
      Stares at himself in the mirror for a moment, alone in the 
      large, echoey room.  No windows.  No way to tell time.

      He finally reaches out and TURNS OFF THE FAUCET as we--

                                                              FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT

      Karen TURNS OFF THE KITCHEN FAUCET.  Samantha and Mark are 
      clearing the dinner table.  A SMALL TV sits on the kitchen 
      counter, tuned in to MSNBC.

                                  MARK
                    I m sure she s fine, just having a 
                    good time somewhere. You know, maybe 
                    we need to give her more space.

                                  KAREN
                    That s a new one, coming from you.  
                    You worry about her even more than I 
                    do. You re just better at hiding it.

                                  MARK
                    Okay, yes, true.  But seriously, I 
                    really think it s time for us to 
                    make an effort, give her her space.  
                    She s not seven anymore.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    What s wrong with seven?                                                                                    44.

                                  MARK
                    Nothing s wrong with seven, Shorty.

                                  KAREN
                    She hasn t called since they left 
                    Miami.

                                  MARK
                    Okay, then, why don t you call her?

                                  KAREN
                    Because she ll get annoyed if I 
                    call.  Not if you call.  Please.

      A beat before he caves in... and grabs the cordless.

                                  MARK
                    All right, okay, fine!  Manipulator.

      WHAT WE SEE ON THE TV SCREEN:

      B-ROLL of the THE VACCINE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, followed by 
      a WIDE SHOT of a LARGE MODERN BUILDING.  The logo hanging 
      over the main entrance reads DEMPSEY PHARMACEUTICALS.

                    of Elivir, which at this time 
                    remains the only drug effective 
                    against the new H1N1 strain.

      ON TV SCREEN: Reporter PAULA DIXON talking TO CAMERA. She 
      stands in a parking lot, as PEOPLE line up to get vaccinated.                                                                                    45.

                    lining up, often for several hours, 
                    to receive the vaccine, which has 
                    been available for the past week, but 
                    so far only through government-run 
                    clinics like this one.

      Samantha grabs the remote and MUTES THE TV.

                          (into phone, to Leila)
                    We haven t heard from you in a 
                    couple of days, so...  your mom and 
                    I just wanted to check in.

                                  KAREN

                    Hi, Sweetie!

                                  MARK
                    Your mom says hi.  How s Sean?

                                  LEILA (O.S.)
                    He s good.  Everything s good.

      ON KAREN AND SAMANTHA

      As Karen pours two glasses of red wine, she takes a quick 
      peek out the window and notices...

                                  KAREN
                    Sam, you left your bike in the 
                    driveway again.  Go get it, put it 
                    in the garage.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    But I m gonna use it tomorrow.

                                  KAREN
                    Not a good excuse, Sam.  Do it.

                                  SAMANTHA
                          (sigh, resigned)
                    Fine.

      BACK ON MARK

                                  MARK
                    Sure, let s do that.

                                  LEILA (O.S.)
                    Tell Mom and Shorty I said hi.

                                  MARK
                    I will.  Love you, Pumpkin.

      He hangs up.                                                                                    47.

                                  KAREN
                    That was quick.  Everything all 
                    right?

                                  MARK
                    Yeah, they re just out partying 
                      somewhere.  She couldn t hear with 
                    the music.  She ll call back 
                    tomorrow.


      Samantha walks out of the house through the open garage door.  
      The night is dark and quiet.  Which doesn t seem to bother 
      her in the least.  She walks over to her bike, picks it up 
      and puts it away in the garage.

      A SHUFFLING NOISE, somewhere near.  Samantha hears it, 
      FREEZES.  She stares into the night past the open garage 
      door.  She waits and listens... when suddenly--

      A GLOVED HAND

      -- appears from behind her, MUFFLES HER SCREAMS.


      Karen just poured two glasses of red wine.

                                  MARK
                    I m just saying, she s in good 
                    hands.  You re gonna have to start 
                    trusting Sean a little more.

                                  KAREN
                    What is that supposed to mean?

                                  MARK
                    Nothing.  Just that we have to be--

                                  KAREN
                    No, no, the way you said that.

                                  MARK
                    What way?

                                  KAREN
                    What do you know?  You know 
                      something.

                                  MARK
                          (amused)
                    No, I don t.                                                                                    48.

      The kitchen door suddenly FLIES OPEN.  TWO MASKED FIGURES 
      burst in from the driveway.  Adrenaline hits Mark and Karen 
      LIKE A BRICK WALL.  

                  MARK (CONT D)KAREN
      What is--Oh my god.

      Karen RUSHES towards the phone on the kitchen counter.  One 
      of the dark figures (a woman?) swiftly LEVELS HER GUN towards 
      Karen.  Woosh, woosh.  TWO SHOTS fired through a silencer.

      Karen KNOCKS HER WINE GLASS off the counter as she collapses.

                                                  END FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT TO:

      A CAN OF HAWAIIAN PUNCH (BACK TO PRESENT DAY)

      -- SPILLS all over white floor tiles.  We PULL BACK to REVEAL 
      the KID who just dropped his drink and his MOTHER ready to 
      scold him.  We re in an AIRPORT.  We SWISH PAN TO...

      FOUR MEN

      -- marching hurriedly together down the concourse, all of 
      them tall, imposing, and on a mission.  These are the four 
      men Sean looked at in Act One.

                                  MAN #1 
                            (instructing the others)
                    You two take the south concourse.  
                    Check stores, restaurants, 
                      bathrooms, everything.  Go!

      As they quickly disperse, camera PANS to LAND ON an OTS SHOT 
      of a MAN IN A DARK BLAZER walking up to a nearby gate.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INSIDE JETWAY

      -- still OTS on the man as he reaches the CABIN of the plane  
      where Maureen greets him with a smile.

                                    MAUREEN
                    Captain, hi!  Maureen Langley.

      We realize the dark jacket we ve been following is actually a 
      PILOT UNIFORM, just as we finally PAN TO REVEAL...

                                  MARK
                    Mark Gasiorowski.  How are you?

      Mark walks INTO THE COCKPIT.  First Officer JERRY BOERSMA is 
      already in his seat.                                                                                    49.

                                  JERRY
                    Mark?  I thought I was flying with 
                    Jeffries.

                                  MARK
                    Yeah, sorry, last minute change.  
                    They just reassigned me.  I think 
                    Jeffries was in car accident on his 
                    way here, something like that.

                                  JERRY
                    I hope he s all right.

                                  MARK
                    Me too.

      Jerry turns back to the controls, flips a few switches.

                                  JERRY
                    Okay, Captain.  We ve got clear 
                    skies all the way to L.A.  Should 
                    be a smooth ride.

      ON MARK

      -- as he FACES CAMERA to close the door, pauses for a short 
      but somber beat.  A resigned sigh.  Then...

      He seals his fate and closes the cockpit door.

                                                              SHOCK CUT TO BLACK.

                                                                  WHITE FLASH TO:


      The plane banks sharply, throwing everyone who is standing to 
      the ground.  Passengers SCREAM.

      Sean, Taylor and Maureen scramble back up to their feet.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Kid, you better tell me what s 
                    going on.  Who s in there?

                                  SEAN
                    I ll explain once we re on the 
                    ground, but right now, unless you 
                    want to be used as a live bomb, you 
                    need to get us in there.

                                  TAYLOR
                          (then to Maureen)
                    Okay.  Open it.

      Maureen dials a code on the electronic padlock.  An orange 
      light starts flashing.

                                  SEAN
                    What s orange?

                                    MAUREEN
                    There s a 30 second delay. The 
                    pilots can override it from inside.

      Beep.  The RED LIGHT COMES ON and stays on.

                                    MAUREEN (CONT D)
                    And they just did.

                                  SEAN
                    Try it again.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Once the override is on, there s no 
                    way to open it from this side.

      Sean kicks the door.  It doesn t budge.

                                  SEAN
                    God dammit!                                                                                    51.

      The engines ROAR LOUDER.  The plane picks up speed.  It s 
      going fast.  Too fast.

                                  PASSENGER
                          (looking out the window)
                    Look!

      ON WINDOWS

      As an F-35 FIGHTER JET GLIDES INTO VIEW, flying parallel to 
      the Boeing.

                                  TAYLOR
                    They re gonna shoot us down.

                                  SEAN
                    Use your gun.  Shoot the lock.

                                  TAYLOR
                    It s kevlar, it s bulletproof.

                                  SEAN
                    The door is bulletproof.  Try 
                    shooting the lock.

                                  TAYLOR
                    It s not gonna work.

                                  SEAN
                    Have you actually ever tried it?

                      TAYLORSEAN
      No, but--Then do it!  Do it now!

      Taylor takes two steps back, aims his gun at the lock and 
      PULLS THE TRIGGER just as we--

                                                              FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT
                                                            (7 DAYS EARLIER) TO:  

      UNDER WATER

      Sean DIVES into the clear water with a MUFFLED SPLASH.  We re 
      back in the Caribbean and in vacation mode.

      A DOZEN TOURISTS, including Sean and Vicky, snorkel around 
      the beautiful corals, petting some of the twenty or so docile 
      stingrays and admiring the colorful fish of  Stingray City. 

                                            SUPER:
                                Georgetown, Grand Cayman
                                      Seven days earlier                                                                                    52.

      Vicky and Sean venture down to the bottom and explore the 
      awesome coral formations.  It s a symphony of colors.  Fun, 
      relaxing.  Almost looks like a postcard.

      We can t help but notice Vicky s amazing body.  Think Jessica 
      Alba.  At least that s what Sean is thinking, and Vicky knows 
      it.  She waves at him.  He aims his underwater camera and 
      takes a picture as a small shark nonchalantly swims by.

                                  VICKY (PRE-LAP)
                    I m so glad we decided to do this.


      Sean and Vicky split up in the lobby.

                                  VICKY
                    I m gonna go see if Greg is back, 
                    tell him how much fun he would have 
                    had if he hadn t fallen off that 
                    stupid ladder.

      Sean flinches, remembering Greg s conflicting story.  He 
      shrugs it off, decides not to say anything.

                                  SEAN
                    Right...  I ll see you at dinner.

                                  VICKY
                    Tell her to feel better.


      Sean strolls down the corridor and reaches his room.  He 
      slides the card into the electronic lock.

      Beep.  Red light.

      He sighs, checks the card, and reinserts it.

      Beep.  Red light.  Again.

                                  SEAN
                    Dammit.                                                                                    54.

      He once again checks the card to make sure it s facing the 
      right way, then reinserts it.  No luck.

      He hesitates for a moment, then starts knocking on the door.  
      No response.  He knocks again.

                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
                    Leila, it s me...  My card is not 
                    working.

      He waits... and waits... but no one comes to the door.  
      Something s not right.  He knocks again.

                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
                    Leil.  Open up.  Are you okay?

      Off his worried look...


      Sean hands the card over to the DESK CLERK.

                                  DESK CLERK
                    Sometimes the magnetic strip gets 
                    damaged.  Let me get you a new one.

                                  SEAN
                    Thanks.

      Sean is growing more concerned by the minute.  The desk clerk 
      hits a few keys on his computer.

                                  DESK CLERK
                    What was the name again, sir?

                                  SEAN
                    Walker.  Sean.

      He hits a few more keys...  then...

                                  DESK CLERK
                    Hmm. Could it be under another name?

                                  SEAN
                    Should be under mine.  You can try 
                    my girlfriend s name, Leila 
                      Gasiorowski.

      The clerk starts typing, hesitates after two letters.

                      G-A-S-I-O-R-O-W-S-K-I.                                                                                    55.

                                  DESK CLERK
                          (typing)
                    Thanks...  Hmm, no, I m not finding 
                    it either.  What s your room number?

                                  SEAN
                    5314.

      The clerk hits a few more keys.

                                  DESK CLERK
                    We don t have a room 5314.

                                  SEAN
                    What do you mean?

                                  DESK CLERK
                    There s no 5314.

                                  SEAN
                    Of course there s a 5314.

                                  DESK CLERK
                    Could it be maybe you have the 
                    wrong room number?

      Could it?

                                  SEAN
                    No.  No, I m sure it s 5314.

                                  DESK CLERK
                    I m sorry.

                                  SEAN
                    What do you mean, you re sorry?  My 
                      girlfriend is in there right now, 
                    and she s not answering, and she 
                    wasn t feeling well this morning, so 
                    if you could just give me a new key.

                                  DESK CLERK
                    Sir, without knowing your room 
                    number, I can t--

                                  SEAN
                    5314!!!

                  DESK CLERKSEAN
      Mr. Walker, we don t--Yes, you do.  I was just up 
                                                  there a minute ago.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    Okay, can you just-- Can someone 
                    just let me into my room?                                                                                    56.


      A wary Sean leads Ship Security Chief JACK MARSH towards his 
      room.  They pass 5309... 5310...

                                  SEAN
                    I know I m in room 5314.

                                  MARSH
                          (skeptical)
                    I guess we re about to find out.

                                  SEAN
                    It s a suite.  My girlfriend and I 
                    have been staying in there since we 
                    left Miami.

      He points at the room numbers as they pass them.

                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
                    See... 5312... 5313...  and...

      They reach the end of the corridor and Sean s cabin.  Sean 
      realizes there is no actual number on his door.

                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
                          (confused)
                      ...5314...

      Marsh looks at him, as if to ask  where do you see 5314? 

                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
                    This is it.  That s my room.

                                  MARSH
                    Sir, that s the janitorial closet.

                                  SEAN
                    What?  No, that s my cabin.
                          (getting angry, pointing 
                          at the other rooms)
                    Okay, that s 5313... and that one 
                    is 5315, so obviously this is 5314.

                                  MARSH
                          (total asshole)
                    I can do math, but we use this room 
                    as a closet.  Are you sure you re 
                    on the right ship?

                                  SEAN
                    I m not crazy, I m not on drugs.  
                    My girlfriend is in there and she s 
                    sick. So...  Can you open it?  Open 
                    the door.                                                                                    57.

      Marsh shoots Sean a dubious look.

                                  MARSH
                    All right.  Fine.

      Marsh slides his key card into the lock.  The door unlocks.

                                  MARSH (CONT D)
                    Here s your suite...

      Sean pushes the door open and rushes into--


      The same layout as Sean s suite.  And filled with cleaning 
      supplies, stacks of clean sheets and towels, a few janitorial 
      carts, a table and a couple of chairs, a coffee machine.

                                  MARSH
                      Satisfied?

      Sean is stunned.  Speechless.


      Sean and Marsh stand at the front desk as the clerk checks 
      information on his computer.

                                  DESK CLERK
                    Sir, we have no record of you or 
                    your girlfriend ever boarding this 
                    ship.  Or even having a reservation.

                                  SEAN
                    That s not possible!  That s crazy!  
                    How do you think I got on?

                                  MARSH
                            (suspicious)
                    You tell us.

                                  SEAN
                    Listen, my girlfriend is in my room--

                                  MARSH
                    Yeah, sir, we re gonna have to check 
                    your passport, see some documents.

                                  SEAN
                          (getting pissed)
                    I would love to show you my passport, 
                    but, see, it happens to be with the 
                    rest of my stuff in my cabin!                                                                                    58.

                                  MARSH
                    I m gonna have to ask you to come up 
                    to the security office with me so we 
                    can clear this up.

                                  SEAN
                    Wait, okay.  This is crazy.  Just-- 
                    Let me make a call.  Okay?

      Marsh reluctantly agrees.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    Okay.  Great.

      Sean pulls out his I-Phone and speed-dials Leila... but...

                                  RECORDED MESSAGE
                    Sorry, this number is not in 
                    service.  Message four-six.

      Sean is starting to panic.  He dials again.

                                  RECORDED MESSAGE (CONT D)
                    Sorry, this number is not in 
                    service. Messa--

      He hangs up.  What is happening???  He turns around and finds 
      the desk clerk and Marsh waiting and staring at him.  He 
      turns away and dials another number.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      TIGHT ON A PHONE

      -- sitting next to an answering machine on a kitchen counter.  
      The phone starts RINGING, as we slowly PAN across the kitchen 
      counter...  and find a RED DROPLET on the white tiles...  
      then a few more... then a lot more...

      Fourth ring.  The answering machine picks up.  The MESSAGE 
      PLAYS as we TILT DOWN to the kitchen floor.

                                  SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                          (recorded on machine)
                    Hi, you have reached Mark, Karen and 
                    Samantha.  We can t come to the 
                    phone right now so leave us a 
                    message!  Byyye!

      Beep.  Camera reaches the kitchen floor and finds A HAND IN A 
      POOL OF DRIED BLOOD.

                                  SEAN (V.O.)
                          (on the phone, filtered)
                    Guys, it s Sean.  Are you there?                                                                                      59.

      BACK TO SEAN

      -- in the LOBBY of the cruise ship.

                                  SEAN
                    Can you give me a call back as soon 
                    as possible on my cell? 678-555-3242.

      He hangs up his cell phone and turns to face Marsh.

                                  MARSH
                    Okay, now follow me upstairs.

      Sean sighs, resigned.  Except he s not.  He TAKES OFF 
      sprinting towards the stairs.

                                  MARSH (CONT D)
                    Hey!  What are you doing?  Stop!

      Marsh and the desk clerk chase after him.  Sean reaches the 
      top of the lobby stairs, darts down a corridor and as he 
      SLAMS HIS BODY INTO A SWING DOOR we-- 

                                                  END FLASHBACK/MATCH CUT TO:


      BANG!

      The loud gun shot resonates through the cabin, along with a 
      COLLECTIVE GASP.  Passengers instinctively duck or look down.

      The bullet destroyed the lock.  A few SPARKS.  Sean rushes to 
      the door, tries to open it.  Still locked.

                                  TAYLOR
                    I told you.

      The plane suddenly ACCELERATES AGAIN, jolting the entire 
      cabin...  then DROPS INTO A RAPID DIVE.  SCREAMS.

      Sean grabs the interphone once more.

                                  SEAN
                    Mark, stop!  Whatever they promised 
                    you, you can t trust them.  You and 
                    I, together, we ll find her.

      Maureen LOOKS THROUGH THE WINDOW, sees the azure waters of 
      Biscayne Bay and its expensive water-front properties 
      APPROACHING FAST as the plane continues its infernal descent.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    Mark, I love Leila too but think 
                    about what you re doing.  She would 
                    never want you to do this.  Mark?                                                                                    60.

      Still no response.  Sean SLAMS THE PHONE against the wall.  
      Camera WOOSHES THROUGH THE WALL and INTO THE COCKPIT, settles  
      on a CU OF MARK.  For a moment, the DEAFENING SOUND of the 
      engines BECOMES MUFFLED.  Tears are rolling down Mark s face. 

                                  F-35 PILOT (V.O.)
                          (on radio)
                    SkyAir 514, final warning.  We are 
                      authorized to fire if you do not 
                    comply.  Squawk 7700 and ident for 
                      acknowledgement.

      Mark closes his eyes.  Camera WOOSHES OUT OF THE COCKPIT, 
      past the plane, and towards the F-35, settles on a CU OF THE 
      F-35 PILOT.  Tense, staring intensely at his target.

                                  F-35 PILOT
                    Air Com, this is Delta-6, I have 
                    missile lock.  Request final 
                      confirmation of orders, over.

      He switches the trigger mechanism to missile, his gloved 
      finger shaking over trigger.

      We WOOOSH OUT OF THE F-35 and down towards the ground, past  
      the Boeing, all the way DOWN TO THE GABLES and settle on...

      PRESIDENT MARTINEZ

      -- on his way to the helipad with his security detail, just 
      as he and Neil catch sight of the diving airliner.  Then...

      IN THE DRIVEWAY

      -- on the other side of the mansion.  Total PANDEMONIUM as 
      REPORTERS, TECH CREWS and PRESIDENTIAL STAFF run for their 
      lives.  Among them, Paula and Rachel, trying to make their 
      way off the property through the maze of news vans.  Paula 
      looks over her shoulder, terrified.

      WIDE

      -- as the airliner slashes through the clear Miami sky, 
      barrelling down towards the Gables.


      Simon speeds down the causeway.  Clear view of the Boeing 
      through his passenger window, seconds from impact.

                                  SIMON
                          (into comm-link)
                    If you re gonna do it, you better 
                    do it now.

      WIDE                                                                                    61.

      -- as THE AIRLINER PLUNGES TOWARDS THE GROUND.

      SERIES OF QUICK REACTION CUTS:

      MARK

      -- in the cockpit, closes his tear-soaked eyes, preparing for 
      death.

      SEAN

      -- inside the cabin.  Passengers hanging on for dear life as 
      luggage starts flying out of the overhead bins and a drink 
      cart CAREENS DOWN THE AISLE and CRASHES inches away from 
      Sean.

      PRESIDENT MARTINEZ

      -- watching from the ground, paralyzed by fear.

      NEIL

      -- a few steps behind him, calm and accepting.

      When suddenly...

      WIDE

      A SPIRAL OF WHITE LIGHT spins out of thin air ahead of the  
      Boeing, creating a PORTAL OF LIGHT.  The plane DISAPPEARS AS 
      IT FLIES THROUGH IT.  The portal explodes into a RING OF 
      WHITE FIRE that is immediately and literally sucked out of 
      the air with a loud WOOOOSH.  The whole thing lasted no more 
      than a second.

      ON PRESIDENT MARTINEZ AND NEIL

      -- as they DROP TO THEIR KNEES and protect themselves just 
      before a POWERFUL BLAST OF AIR blows through the property, 
      sending garden furniture flying, ripping off a few palm tree 
      branches, shattering a couple of windows.  

      Then everything is SUDDENLY QUIET.  Eerily quiet.  Like 
      normal.  Except nothing will ever be normal again.

      Martinez looks up incredulously into the sky where the 
      airliner was just a couple of seconds earlier.  It s gone.  

      ON F-35 AND F-35 PILOT

      -- as he pulls up and flies over the Gables.

                                  F-35 PILOT
                          (shocked, confused)
                    Target is... Gone.  They re gone.                                                                                    62.

      BACK ON PRESIDENT MARTINEZ AND NEIL

      Martinez takes a quick glance over at CHRISTINA AND THE KIDS 
      in Marine One.  Shaken but unharmed, Christina nods at him 
        reassuringly as she hugs her children.

      Wide-eyed, trying to comprehend the impossible phenomenon he 
      just witnessed, Martinez turns his attention back to the
