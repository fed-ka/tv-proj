      CHO and RIGSBY sit at their desks sorting through dozens of 
      files.  LISBON carries over another stack of folders.  Jane 
      enters, greeted by grumpy growls and grunts.  He's followed 
      shortly by Van Pelt with coffee and a spring in her step.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Good morning, everybody.

                                  CHO
                    What's so good about it?

                                  LISBON
                    Here, have some more files.  
                    They're auditing the division 
                    again.

                    No problem.  Let me just get some 
                    milk for this and I'll dig in.  

      Coffee in hand, she heads for the kitchen. 

                                  CHO
                    No problem?  What's with her?

      THEIR POV: Van Pelt cheerfully says hi to some co-workers.

                                  JANE
                    Notice the relaxed body language 
                    and general sense of emotional 
                      satisfaction.     

                                  RIGSBY
                    Yes.  

                                  JANE
                    Someone has engaged her romantic 
                    interest.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Who?

                                  JANE
                    Couldn't say.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Nah.  Can't be.  She's focused on 
                    her work right now.  Nah.

                                  JANE
                    Well then I must assume the man 
                    that kissed her outside was making 
                    an embarrassing mistake.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Who?  Who kissed her?

                                  JANE
                    I didn't get his name.

                                  RIGSBY
                    It's probably that knucklehead in 
                    payroll.  He's been stalking her 
                    like a chicken.  What did this man 
                    look like?

      Lisbon starts back toward her office.  Suddenly Jane's CELL 
      PHONE BEEPS.  He checks a text message.

                                  CHO
                    How d'you stalk a chicken?

                    Lisbon...

      She turns back.

                                  LISBON 
                    What?

      Jane crosses toward her office and hands her his phone. 

      QUICK INSERT -- Jane's phone screen.

      She reads...

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                    There's a very large bomb nearby.  
                    Are you smart enough to find it?

      PRELAP - EVACUATION ALARM SIREN over... 


      Jane is in bed, bandages taped over his eyes.  Lisbon stands 
      by his side with DR. FULLER, female, 40's, as she examines an 
      x-ray of Jane's skull.  

                                  DR. FULLER
                    You're a lucky man, Mr. Jane.  This 
                    could have been much worse.

                                  JANE
                    That's what people keep telling me.  
                    Why can't I see?

      Fuller flips though Jane's chart. 

                                  DR. FULLER
                    There's a moderate concussion with 
                    some short term memory loss. 
                      Disorientation, headache, and of 
                    course, the fleeting blindness.  
                    This is most likely due to small 
                    floating blood clots in the vessels 
                    around the eyes demonstrating as 
                    CVI or cortical visual impairment.  

                                  LISBON
                    So how long will his vision be 
                    effected? 

                                  DR. FULLER
                    It's hard to say really.  The 
                    body's healing powers are 
                      unpredictable.  But forty-eight to 
                      seventy-two hours is the norm.  We 
                    must wait and see, so to speak.

                                  JANE
                    Humor, great.  Everybody loves a 
                    witty doctor in times of trouble.  
                    I've heard enough.  Can you guys 
                    take the discussion outside?  

                                  DR. FULLER
                    Mr. Jane, this is temporary.  Your 
                    sight will return and you'll be 
                    back to work.  But it's going to 
                    take time and patience.

                    while ago. 

                                  DR. FULLER
                    You're alive.  Appreciate it.

                                  JANE
                    Oh, I do.

                                  DR. FULLER
                    If you'll excuse me, I'll check in 
                    again later.

                                  LISBON
                    Thank you, doctor. 

      And as the doctor exits, she passes Cho in the doorway.  
      Lisbon pinches Jane's arm. 

                                  JANE
                    Ouch.

                    I'll do worse if you keep mouthing 
                    off to people who are trying to 
                    help you.

                    Who'd have thought? 

                                  JANE
                    I am not a bad patient.  She's a 
                    bad visitor.

                                  LISBON 
                    What did you find out?

                                  CHO
                    The vic is James Medina, forty-
                    four, stockbroker, out of 
                      Highlands.  The van wasn't his.    
                    It was reported stolen yesterday.  
                    We're digging up everything we can 
                    on Medina.  Question.  Is it 
                    possible he was on some bizarre 
                    suicide mission?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        9.

                                  JANE
                    No.  I looked in his eyes.  That 
                    was a man who very much didn't want 
                    to be where he was.  Whoever did 
                    this wanted me to watch James 
                    Medina die in terror.

                                  CHO
                    And they nearly killed you too. 

                                  JANE
                    That wasn't the intention though.

                    What then? 

                                  JANE
                    "You're next" was written on the 
                    man's forehead.  Whoever did this 
                    wanted me to be haunted by that and 
                    be afraid.  

                                  LISBON
                    Why?

                    Probably.

                                  LISBON
                    We'll find out who did this.

                    Good.

      Cho and Lisbon exchange glances again. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Don't keep looking at each other 
                    like that.

                                  LISBON
                    Like what?  You can't see.

                                  JANE
                    I can feel your pity.

                                  LISBON
                    Would you stop please.  We'll be

      And they exit, leaving Jane with a UNIFORMED GUARD outside 
      the door.  Jane leans back into his pillows and lets his 
      bravado down.  Alone, quiet, he shows us a glimmer of 
      vulnerability.


      Upscale, modern office space.  The company logo is on the

                    blue chip investors and novice day 
                    traders.  Granted, a few customers 
                    foolishly held us responsible for 
                    recent economic events, but that's 
                    to be expected.  

                                  CHO
                    We'll need names.

                    I'll make sure you get them.

      They stop in front of an open door.

                                  LYNCH
                    As a Vice President here, Jim

      Cho and Rigsby search through drawers, thumbing through

                    When you spend as much time 
                    together as we do, there are bound 
                    to be differences.  Now that you 
                    mention it, there was one employee 
                    about a year ago... Terry Andrews.

                    Mr. Andrews used to work here as a  *
                    junior trader -- until he got into  *
                      a shouting match with Medina and  *
                    Jimmy fired him.  Once or twice  *
                    Terry waited outside the gates for  *
                    Jim to drive past.  He was  *
                    menacing, that's for sure.  

      Cho and Rigsby exchange a glance.


      Eyes still taped, Jane lays in bed, frustrated.  Finally he 
      rips the blood pressure cuff off his arm and pulls the taped 
      pulse monitor from his fingertip.

      Jane gingerly gets up out of bed and starts feeling his way 
      toward the closet.  Finds the closet door and starts pulling 
      his clothes off hangers.  Suddenly -- 

                                  DR. FULLER
                    What are you doing?

      Dr. Fuller stands in the doorway.

                                  JANE
                    Leaving.  I have work to do.  

                                  DR. FULLER
                          (sternly)
                    So do I.  Back in bed.  

                                  JANE
                    Sign me out.

                                  DR. FULLER
                    Not yet.

      She takes his arm and, standing beside him, guides him back 
      toward the bed.  

                                  JANE
                    You have a lovely graceful curve to 
                    your hip, Doctor.  If you don't 
                    mind me saying so.

      Fuller smiles. 

                                  DR. FULLER
                    Thank you.  Now don't make me strap 
                    you to the bed. 

      She turns to go.

                                  JANE
                    Doctor, don't be long.  Maybe we 
                    can go for a walk later.

                                  DR. FULLER
                    Relax, Mr. Jane.

                                  JANE
                    This is relaxed.  

      The doctor exits, then turns back into the doorway.

                                  DR. FULLER
                    And leave my staff alone.  Do you 
                      understand?  

      Jane sniffs the air.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        14.

                    Your soap has lavender in it.  
                    Chamomile too.  Delightful.    

      The Doctor turns and goes.  Off Jane, grinning --


      The team works into the evening.  A pizza box and some soda 
      cans are strewn about.  Van Pelt sits at her computer.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Terence Carter Andrews, forty-six years 
                    old.  Worked two years at Lynch-Halstead 
                    in the junior trader program.  Tax files 
                    indicate he also worked as a guard for 
                    several of the security companies that 
                    cover the State Capitol system.     

                                  LISBON
                    He was a state house employee?  He 
                    worked here?

                                  VAN PELT
                    That's what it says.  He has a 
                    sheet on him.  Domestic abuse and 
                    two DUI's.  

                                  LISBON
                    Bring up his picture. 

      They all huddle around Van Pelt's desk.  A PHOTO of Andrews, 
      mid 40's, rock-solid, appears. 

                                  CHO
                    Where's he working now?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Guest relations manager for 
                    something called Hype.  


      Jane, dressed and using a red-and-white cane, cautiously 
      enters.  The UNIFORMED GUARD that was watching him at the 
      hospital helps him around the corner.  Dark glasses cover 
      Jane's bandages.  Van Pelt catches sight of him.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Hey, aren't you supposed to be in 
                    the hospital?

                                  JANE
                    No.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Yes you are.

                                  JANE
                    They had enough of me.  Can you 
                    blame them?  Officer Powell here 
                    was good enough to drive me back. 

                                  VAN PELT
                          (to Powell)
                    Thank you... I guess. 

      Powell exits.  Suddenly Van Pelt's CELL RINGS.  She checks 
      it, then ignores it, muting the ring tone.

                                  JANE
                    Go ahead, talk to your boyfriend.   
                    I don't mind.

                                  VAN PELT
                          (blushing)
                    Shush.

                                  JANE
                    What are you embarrassed about?

                                  VAN PELT
                    I'm not, I'm --

      Lisbon hurries over, silencing Van Pelt.

                                  LISBON
                    Jane.  What the hell?

                                  JANE
                    My doctor said it's okay if I go 
                    back to work.

                    She did not. She said you insulted 
                    the entire ward and you're a 
                    complete pain in the ass. 

                                  JANE
                    So?

                                  LISBON
                    So you can't do that.   

                                  JANE
                    What was I supposed to do -- listen 
                    to television?  Besides, the food 
                    was terrible.

                                  LISBON 
                    You need to rest.

                    I need to be back at work. 

                                  LISBON
                    You're blind. 

                                  JANE
                    Not a problem.  My other senses 
                    have all become super-heightened, 
                    like Daredevil.    

                                  LISBON
                    Okay.

                                  JANE
                    Now if you'll excuse me. 

      Using his cane, he moves forward but bumps into a bullpen 
      partition.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Oops.

      As Lisbon, not amused, watches him continue --


      Rigsby question Andrews.

                    I went back to my place,  watched a 
                    little TV and I went to bed.  I was 
                    asleep until eleven or so. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Anybody who can vouch for that time

                    Nope.  I live alone.  On account my 
                    lady walked out when I lost my job. 

      Suddenly, the door opens.  Cane in hand and still wearing his 
      glasses, Jane wanders in.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry.  Don't mind me.

                    What's this?  What's going on?

      Jane finds a folding chair and sits very close to Andrews.

                    could have, I wanted to, but I 
                    didn't.  

      Jane sniffs at Andrews, leaning in close.

                    I was a junior trader in the 
                    company program.  The guy had been 
                    picking on me for months.  I think 
                    I took a job his nephew wanted. 
                    Anyway, a freaking envelope falls 
                    off his desk.  Pick it up he says.  
                    Like that.  Pick it up.  I don't 
                    think so.  Pick it up your own damn 
                    self is what I said.  Big deal.  
                    But he figures, "Hey, let me just 
                    snap my fingers and totally screw 
                    up this dude's life." 

                                  JANE
                    Can I hold your hand?

      He reaches out, takes Andrews' hand.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Artistic fingers.  

      Andrews pulls his hand away.  Jane puts his fingers gently to 
      Andrews' face.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Soft.

                                    ANDREWS
                    Don't do that.

      Jane stands up abruptly.

                                  JANE
                    Nice meeting you, Terry.  Be well.
                          (to Rigsby)
                    You can let him go.

      Unfolding his cane, he starts back toward the door.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Uh, that's not your call.   

                                  JANE
                    I didn't say you must let him go, I 
                    said you can.  If you want.  Being 
                    as he's innocent.

                                    ANDREWS
                    Thank you.

      Lisbon enters.

      Rigsby emerges from the interrogation room, reacts 
      quizzically to Jane and Lisbon, who steps away from Jane, a 
      tad self-conscious.

                                  RIGSBY
                    So what's the deal, boss?

                    Will do.

                    I'm still convinced there's a

                    Before you make my costume, will 
                    you take me to visit his widow? 

      Lisbon sighs, and surrenders to the Jane of it all.

                                  LISBON
                    Maybe.

      drifts to the right where he finds a small pitcher of milk. 
      He pours.

                    Mrs. Medina, we don't want to keep 
                    you from your family.  We just have 
                    a few more questions. 

                                  LAURI
                      I understand.  I'm happy to help.

                                  JANE
                    I can feel what a warm, caring home 
                    this is.  I'm very sorry for your

                                  JANE
                    I think whoever did this was 
                    targeting your husband and me, 
                    also.  I don't know why.  But 
                    something links us.  I have to ask, 
                    have we ever met before?

                                  LAURI
                    Not that I know of.

                                  JANE
                    Would it be a terrible 
                      inconvenience to show me some of 
                    your husband's personal things?  
                    Jewelry, anything he used a lot. *

                                  LAURI

                    Holding something of James' will

      Lauri goes to get the stuff.  Once she's out of earshot, 
      Lisbon leans in and whispers.

                    Just go with it.  I've got to

                    No, right, because bad stuff like 
                    this doesn't happen nearly as often 
                    as people think.  


      Jane sits on the sofa, feeling his way through a bunch of 
      stuff on the coffee table.  Lisbon stands beside him.  Lauri 
      Medina watches as well. 

      Jane holds a pair of glasses.

                    Jim couldn't read without them.  He 
                    was considering surgery, but I

      FLASHBACK


      MOS -- A YOUNGER JANE (before the Red John incident), eight 
      years ago, slick, flashy, sits in a modern but comfortable 
      office overlooking the ocean with a WOMAN, 30's (who he'll 
      later remember as JILL LAMONT).  She's handing Jane an 
      identical watch to the one that was Jimmy's.  We never see 
      her face.  Jane's memory denying him all but oblique views of 
      her.  What he remembers clearly is the watch...  

      Jane turns the watch in his hand, feeling it, closes his 
      eyes.

      ANGLE -- Jane rubs his thumb over the ENGRAVED LYNCH-HALSTEAD 
      FIGHTING BULL on the back.  Pauses.  Squints as if he's 
      feeling something.

      He reaches out for her hands.  As all four hands come 
      together squeezing the watch simultaneously, we --

      Jane puts down the watch.  Troubled.

                    Jane, do me a favor.  Find out from 
                    Van Pelt who this guy is that she's 
                    dating.  Like, what's the score?

                                  JANE
                    The score.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Are they serious.  Have they, you 
                    know.  

                                  JANE
                    Ask her yourself.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Yeah right.  No.  Come on.  You 
                    know what the situation is.  It's 
                    against the rules.  Relationships 
                    between co-workers. 

                                  JANE
                    What are you, a man or a mouse?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Well, a man, obviously. 

                                  JANE *
                    Could have fooled me. *

                                    RIGSBY *
                    We'd be slipping around.  That's if  *
                    she wanted to.  Which she doesn't  *
                    as far as I can see.  
                          (beat)
                    And if it is that guy in payroll,  *
                    I'll kill him.   *

                                  JANE *
                    Well, that would be a strong 
                    romantic statement.  Women like a 
                    man that will kill for them. 
                          (loud)
                    Hey, Van Pelt? 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Don't.

                                  JANE
                    What?  Trust me.  Honesty is best.

                                  RIGSBY
                    No.  No.

      Van Pelt enters.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What's up?

                                  JANE
                    Grace, a personal question.  Rigsby 
                    and I were wondering who this man 
                    is that you were kissing by the 
                    coffee cart?

      Van Pelt and Rigsby are both angry and embarrassed.

                                  VAN PELT
                    That, that's none of your business.

                                  JANE
                    He's not from payroll?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Payroll?  No.  He doesn't work 
                    here, he's, none of your business.

      Van Pelt stalks away.  Jane smiles innocently at Rigsby. 

                                  JANE
                    Well, thank heavens for that 
                    anyway.  No killing needed. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Don't be so sure.

                                  JANE
                    You'll see, honesty is best. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Honestly, if you weren't blind, I 
                    would kick your butt.

                                  JANE 
                    I know it.  Would you guide me to 
                    my couch?

      Rigsby helps Jane to his sofa, and exits quickly without 
      looking at Van Pelt, who is looking through SHOEBOXES under 
      Jane's desk.  On the side of each box, he's scribbled the 
      contents.  As they talk, she lifts the lids, thumbing through 
      one after another.

                                  VAN PELT
                    That was cruel.  Why did you do 
                    that?  

                                  JANE
                    Yes it was.  This blindness 
                    nuisance is making me mean.  
                    I'm sorry.

                                  VAN PELT
                    There's nothing to talk about.  
                    Is this it?

      She's holding up a scratched old disk, then realizes her 
      mistake.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  Is it a silver CD with RPB

                                  JANE
                    Could be.

      Van Pelt loads it into her computer.  She starts opening 
      windows and clicking through files.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    You have a lot to talk about.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Like what.

                    Is it serious, you and coffee cart

                                  VAN PELT
                    Too early to tell.

                    I'd like to meet him.  What floor 
                    does he work on? 

                                  VAN PELT
                    He doesn't.  He's a lawyer.  He was 
                    visiting.  No offense, but why is 
                    my private life your business, or 
                    Rigsby's?

                    Me, I'm nosy.  But Rigsby loves 
                    you.  Only he's scared of emotional 
                      commitment.  You're attracted to 
                    him, but you're deeply repressed 
                    and emotionally shut down.

                    yourself.

      Van Pelt sits very still for a moment, as if hiding from 
      something terrible.  Jane's hit home.  He hears her silence.

      Jane motionless, pale, lost in reverie.

      FADE IN:


      Jane lies on his sofa looking pale and wan.  A MEDIC puts 
      bandages back over his eyes as Minelli and Lisbon gaze down 
      at him. 

                                    MINELLI
                    Is he alright?

      The Medic nods yes.

                                  JANE
                    I'm one hundred percent okay.   
                    There's no need to send me back.

      The Medic grabs his kit and steps away.

                                  LISBON

                    it an order.

      Minelli takes pity on Jane.

                                    MINELLI
                    I could, but someone did try to 
                    kill him remember.  We can protect 
                    him better here.  At less expense. 

                                  JANE
                    Thank you, Virgil.

                                    MINELLI 
                    Okay.  But this is a favor. 
                    If you die in this department, I'm 
                      responsible.  I do all the 
                      paperwork.  
                          (to Lisbon)
                    In fact, if he does die for 
                    whatever reason, move him to a 
                    public area, would you?  I'd be 
                    very grateful.

                                  JANE
                    I hope he's smiling.

      Minelli walks away.  Jane slowly sits up, preparing to stand, 
      looking very weak.

                    A little help here?


      Jane sits with Lisbon, Cho, Rigsby and Van Pelt; getting a 
      briefing.

                    So we've started checking out your

                      Lynch-Halstead was her broker for a 
                    while, but --

                    -- It's a coincidence.  She's not a 
                    suspect.

                    How can you be so sure?

                                  JANE
                    Carol Gentry killed herself five 
                    years ago.  Left no family.

      Everybody's quiet as they consider this and the burden of 
      guilt that Jane must be carrying. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    What happened?  Did everybody

                    Not quite.  Van Pelt did a deeper search.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    We cross-checked spouse's names and 
                    came up with a second hit.  You had 
                    a client, name of Jill Lamont.  Her 
                    husband was Paul Krager, and he 
                    used to work for Lynch-Halstead.   

                                  JANE
                    Jill Lamont?  Yes...

      ON JANE --

      FLASHBACK


      The first flashback we saw in Scene 17.  A younger Jane sits 
      with the WOMAN we now see clearly -- JILL LAMONT.  She hands 
      him the engraved watch.

                                  JANE
                    Mrs. Krager, tell me more about 
                    your husband.  Anything.

                                  JILL LAMONT
                    He loves me.  Loves our son.  
                    Family's everything to him.  But 
                    I've noticed a change lately.  

                                  JANE
                    What kind of change?

                                  JILL LAMONT
                    He seems preoccupied.  I asked the 
                    other wives if anything was 
                    happening at work, but they said 
                    no.

                                  JANE
                    And that's when you began to wonder 
                    if he's being unfaithful?

                                  JILL LAMONT
                    That's right. 

      ANGLE -- Jane rubs his thumb over the engraving of a fighting 
      bull on the back.  Pauses.  Squints as if he's feeling 
      something.

                    Wait, something's coming through.  
                    Feel it with me...

      He quickly reaches out for Jill's hands.  All four hands are 
      clasped together squeezing the watch simultaneously.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I'm feeling Paul hasn't been one 
                    hundred percent honest with you.  
                    He hasn't been happy.  You know 
                    that.  Do you sense someone else in 
                    his life?  Your senses never lie.

      Jill start to cry.

                                  JILL LAMONT
                    Yes, yes I do.  There's someone 
                    else.  Is he leaving me?

                                  JANE
                    Talk to him, Jill.  Don't let Paul 
                    ruin what you have together. 

      And as he continues to rub Paul Krager's Rolex in his hand, 
      we:

      Cho and Lisbon exit the elevators, walking Robert Lynch out 
      of the building. 

                                  LYNCH
                      Interesting.  Paul Krager's a name 
                    I haven't heard in a while.  He 
                    never even entered my mind.  

                                  LISBON
                    What can you tell us about his 
                    personal life? 

                                  LYNCH
                    Well, we've all made our mistakes 
                    over the years.  Fat wallets and 
                    good wine can do that to a man.  

                                  CHO
                    You're referring to his divorce?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        38.

                                  LYNCH
                    That was no divorce... that was a 
                    massacre.  His wife remarried, I 
                    think.  But Krager's whole world 
                    fell apart.  Work-wise, he never 
                      recovered.  Went off the rails to 
                    be frank.  We had to let him go. 

      They push through the outside doors to the busy street and 
      walk toward a waiting TOWN CAR.  

                                  LISBON
                    Who actually did the firing?

                                  LYNCH
                    Now that you mention it, Jimmy 
                    Medina did.  Jim did a lot of the 
                    axe-work here.  Unfortunate part of 
                    the job. 

      This understandably resonates with Lisbon and Cho.

                                  CHO
                    Any idea where we could find Krager 
                    now?

      Lynch is about to climb into the waiting car, hesitates.

                                  LYNCH
                    Last I heard, someone saw him at a 
                    church soup kitchen during the 
                    holidays.  There but for the grace 
                    of God... if you know what I mean. 

      Lynch slips into the car and closes the door.  As Cho and 
      Lisbon watch him pull away --


      Lisbon, Cho and Rigsby look through files on the Krager 
      family.  Jane leans on Van Pelt's desk. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Lynch was right.  The legal fees 
                    alone nearly bankrupted Krager.  
                    His wife took their son, moved East 
                    and remarried.   

                                  CHO
                    So where's Krager now?

                    Based on what we can find out, he 
                    was so devastated losing his 
                    family, his whole world collapsed.

                                  LISBON
                    No current address.  He hasn't 
                    filed a tax return in years.  And 
                    his last known employer was Lynch-
                    Halstead -- in 2001.  

                                  CHO 
                    Boy, you really did a number on 
                    him.

                                  JANE 
                    Thanks.  Yes I did.

                                  LISBON
                    No.  You simply confirmed what she 
                    knew in her heart anyhow.  

      Jane starts to move toward his sofa.

                    Has anybody contacted her?  Jill

                    Hi, can I help you? 

      This to a young man -- Dan Hollenbeck, who we remember from 
      the coffee cart.  Van Pelt turns and sees who it is.

                    I don't know you, Dan.  Maybe 
                    you're a nice guy, I don't know.    
                    I hope so.  If you ever hurt Grace 
                    Van Pelt, in any way, I will find 
                    you and cause you pain.  Because 
                    she means a lot to, to this unit.     
                    You treat her right, okay? 

      Dan is maybe just a little intimidated...




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        43.
      CONTINUED:3131

                                  DAN
                    I hear you.  I appreciate your 
                    concern.  You care for Grace.  
                    Don't worry.  I'm a nice guy. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Okay then.  Sorry to get heavy with 
                    you.  I had to say it.  Just so 
                    long as we understand each other.

                                  DAN
                    Sure thing.  I understand.  I do. 

      Rigsby turns back toward the door as Dan rushes up behind him 
      and RABBIT PUNCHES him hard in the neck.  Rigsby falls, and 
      as he does Dan pulls his 9MM handgun from its holster.  He 
      then bashes Rigsby over the head with the butt of the gun as 
      hard as he can.  Rigsby goes down, and Dan keeps hitting him. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                  END OF ACT THREE    THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        44.


                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Dan exits the men's room, adjusting his tie.


      In a closed toilet stall, Rigsby -- unconscious and bleeding -- 
      is cuffed (with his own handcuffs) to a metal pipe.


      Dan rejoins an anxious Van Pelt, drinking coffee.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I'm so embarrassed.  What did 
                    Rigsby say?

                                  DAN
                    No call for embarrassment.  He's a 
                      good-hearted person.  I like him.   
                    He wants you to be happy, or else.  

      Van Pelt summons a smile.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What did you say?

                                  DAN
                    I said I would do my best.

                                  VAN PELT
                          (smiles a little)
                    You did?

                                  DAN
                    I did.  
                          (then)
                    Where's this psychic character you 
                    told me about?  I'm dying to meet 
                    him.   

                                  VAN PELT
                    He wanted to meet you too.


      ON JANE -- very still, with the glasses, it's hard to say if 
      he's awake or asleep.  Van Pelt and Dan come over. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    Jane?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        45.
      CONTINUED:3535

      Jane starts up from sleep, looks around, only to clutch at 
      his eyes and realize all over again that he's blind. 

                                  JANE
                    Damn.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Sorry, I wasn't sure whether to 
                    wake you or not. 

                                  JANE
                    I'm awake.

                                  VAN PELT
                    You said you wanted to meet the man 
                    I've been dating.

      Jane sits up.

                                  JANE
                    Yes I did.  Is he coming? 

                                  VAN PELT
                    He's here.

      Jane's fully alert now.  

                                  JANE
                    Here?  Here now?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Yes.  

      Dan touches Jane's arm.

                                  DAN
                    Right here.  Dan Hollenbeck, sir. 
                    It's a real pleasure to meet you.  
                    Grace has told me so much about 
                    you.  

      Dan's looking around surreptitiously, waiting on the last few 
      people to exit the office, leaving him alone with Van Pelt 
      and Jane. 

                                  JANE
                    Hello, Dan.  Great to meet you.

      Jane puts out his hand to shake, Dan takes it.  Jane puts his 
      other hand on Dan's shoulder.

                                  DAN
                    Excuse my asking, but are you, uh...

                                  JANE
                    Blind.  Yes.  

                                  VAN PELT
                      Temporarily blind.  Think positive.

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Positive.  Right.
                    I wonder, Van Pelt, where is Rigsby 
                    exactly?

                                  VAN PELT 
                    I don't know.  In the kitchen if I 
                    know Rigsby.  You need him for 
                      something?  I can go look for him 
                    if you want.

                                  JANE
                    Lisbon?  Cho?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Still out chasing down Paul Krager.  
                    Nobody here but us.

                                  JANE
                    Of course.  
                          (beat)
                    So, Dan, nice hard grip you have 
                    there.  Working man's hands.         
                    And a faint scent of chemicals. 
                    But an expensive Italian suit. 
                      Interesting.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Dan's a lawyer.

                                  DAN
                    A very junior lawyer.  I lobby the 
                    state senate. 

                                  JANE 
                    But you're good with your hands.  
                    Good at building things.  Maybe as 
                    a hobby.  

                                  DAN 
                    I guess. 

                                  JANE
                    What sort of things do you build?  
                    As a hobby?

                                  DAN
                    You know, stuff.

                    And your parents?  Where are they?

      Beat.

                                  DAN
                          (without affect)
                    They're dead.

                                  JANE 
                    Sorry to be a busybody.  Just want to 
                    be sure Grace finds the right young 
                    man.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Hush.

      Van Pelt hasn't caught on that the tension in the air isn't 
      romantic.  There's a real sense of cat-and-mouse going on 
      between Hollenbeck and Jane.

                                  JANE
                    Well, I'm hungry.  Guess I'll go 
                    find something to eat...

      He stands up.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Don't be silly.  I'll get you something. 

                                  JANE
                    That's okay.  I can manage.

      Dan gets right up close to Jane, his back to Van Pelt.  He 
      rests his hand on the gun tucked in his waistband.

                                  DAN
                          (whispers in his ear)
                    Think I'm dumb?  Make the wrong move 
                    and I'll shoot her in the head. 

                                  JANE
                    I hear you.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What are you guys whispering about?

                                  JANE
                    Nothing.  Some chips would be nice.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What kind?

                                  JANE 
                    I'm easy.

      Van Pelt's walking away when the PHONE RINGS, and she checks 
      the caller ID.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    It's the boss.

      She picks up the phone.


      Garbage strewn about.  Clearly a squat.  In one corner, 
      someone's makeshift home.  Paul Krager's fall from greatness. 
      On the walls, PHOTOS and clippings of Krager's pre-
      occupations -- Jane, Medina, Jill LaMont and their teenage 
      son.  And a more current photo of KRAGER'S SON -- who we 
      recognize as Dan Hollenbeck.  As we see this, Lisbon's 
      talking.  Cho is studying the photos, and an elderly PAUL 
      KRAGER sits on an old ripped mattress in handcuffs.  

                                  LISBON
                    Looks like we've cracked it.
                          (on phone)
                    We found Paul Krager.  He has an 
                    obsession with Jane and Medina.  
                    Remember he has a son?  Krager says he 
                    lives here in the city now.    Goes by 
                    Dan Hollenbeck -- six-foot-one, 
                      one-seventy, dark hair...


      Van Pelt listening to this on the phone, looks right at Dan.  
      She turns pale.  Dan reveals he has a gun, which he now keeps 
      low, hidden and pointed at her.

                                  VAN PELT
                          (unnaturally)
                    Oh.  Thank you Agent Lisbon.  Okay. 
                    Good.  We're here.  See you soon.

      She hangs up.  


      Lisbon looks at Cho, curious.  Then back to the phone.

                                  LISBON
                    That was weird.


      Dan with a gun on Van Pelt and Jane.  He whispers --

                                  DAN
                    Sorry about this.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        49.

      Van Pelt's gaze goes to her own GUN AND HOLSTER, lying on her 
      desk. 

                                  VAN PELT
                          (playing for time)
                    I don't understand.  

                                  JANE
                    He's the bomber.  He killed James 
                    Medina.  Now he's come to kill me.

      Van Pelt edges toward her gun, but Dan notices.

                                  DAN
                    Don't even think about it.

      Dan is quick to grab her gun and pocket it.  He's getting 
      more hyper as the situation develops.  Checks to make sure no 
      one's entering the bullpen.

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    I'm sorry I had to lie to you, 
                    Grace.  Truly.  But I needed you.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Why?

                                  JANE
                    To get access to the statehouse 
                    lot.  He needed your ID badge.

                    Be cool, Van Pelt.

      Van Pelt looks around for help.  The office is deserted.

                                  DAN 
                    Grace, relax.  I have no desire to 
                    hurt you.  Just do as I say.

                    I'm in too deep.  Can't stop now.
                    Don't make me hurt you.

                                  JANE
                    Do as he says.

                                  DAN 
                    Oh you're a nice guy now, aren't you?  
                    You destroyed my life.  For what?  
                    Because my dad cheated on my mom.  
                    Big deal!  He wasn't perfect. Hello?  
                    For that, he's on the street?  He 
                    loses everything?  One day I'm at the 
                    best, the best private school in Los 
                    Angeles.  Okay?  Playing soccer with 
                    movie star's kids.  Next minute I'm 
                    in Dogpatch New Jersey with my 
                    weeping mom, getting my ass whipped 
                    by thugs that don't even speak 
                    freakin' English.  Why?  Because you, 
                    you had to be the man who knows.  You 
                    had tell my mom the "truth."  

                                  JANE 
                    I'm sorry.

                                  DAN
                    Sure you are.  With a gun at your head.  
                          (to Van Pelt)
                    Take out your handcuffs.  You can 
                    help me get him out of here.

                                  JANE
                    Where are we going?

                                  DAN
                    Somewhere quiet and private.  You 
                    won't like it.  Stand up.

      Jane obeys.  

                                  DAN (CONT'D)
                    Time to go. Come on. *

      Dan quickly cuffs Van Pelt's hands behind her back and drapes  *
      her coat over them to conceal what he's done.  Jane puts one  *
      hand on Van Pelt's shoulder for guidance as Dan stands behind  *
      them, gun ready. *

                                  DAN (CONT D) *
                    Okay... where's your car, Grace? *

      He pokes the gun in her back.

                                  VAN PELT
                    In the side parking lot.  A Jeep.  *
                    Iowa plates.

                                  DAN
                    I didn't know you were from Iowa.  
                    Famous potatoes, huh? 

                                  VAN PELT
                    That's Idaho, you ignorant jerk.

                                  DAN
                    Yeah?  So what's Iowa famous for?

                                  JANE
                    Gullible women.

      Van Pelt glares at Jane, irked by the insult. *

                                  VAN PELT 
                    That's not fair.  

                                  DAN
                    Get moving. *

      And as they exit the bullpen -- *

      OMITTED4040


      A bullet strikes the window.  Another sparks and careens off 
      the hood.  Jane's in the driver's seat, Van Pelt in the 
      passenger seat.  Jane fumbles the key into the ignition, 
      starts the car.  Dan's nearly on them.  Jane puts the car 
      into gear.  It lurches backward -- CRUNCH -- into the car 
      behind.  Dan steadies himself to shoot, but Jane throws the 
      car into gear and floors it.  The car darts forward.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Turn!  Turn right. 

      CRUNCH!  The Jeep side-swipes another parked vehicle. 

                                  JANE
                    Which way?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Floor it!  Go.

      Jane nails his foot down again blindly and they drive away.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        53.
      CONTINUED:4242

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                      Straighten up!  Left!  Go!  Stop! 

      CRASH! Another car.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Go back!  Reverse!  Yes!  No!    

      CRUNCH!

      By this method, Jane and Van Pelt dodge their way across the 
      lot, with Dan in hot pursuit.

      But finally, Jane gets the bumper caught against another car 
      and they're immobilized.  Dan approaches, raises his gun to 
      shoot Jane through the windshield when -- CLICK.  The 9MM 
      jams.  He recocks it and -- BAM!

      A gunshot hits Dan in the torso and drops him to the ground, 
      DEAD.  We RACK-FOCUS to Lisbon, gun raised.  Lisbon runs up 
      close behind.  Kneels to check Dan.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    Oh thank God.  Thank God. 

                                  JANE
                    Can I assume something good happened? 
                    Lisbon?  

                                  LISBON
                    Didn't I say no excitement of any 
                    kind?

      Then Jane remembers --

                                  JANE
                    Rigsby...


      Two UNI OFFICERS have uncuffed Rigsby.  He holds a towel to a 
      wound on his head as the door swings open and Van Pelt 
      appears, out of breath.   *

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Oh.  Oh.  You're alive.  Are you 
                    okay?   

      He moves toward her, woozy, fumbling a bit.  She embraces him  *
      in a hug.  The Officers exit. *

                    I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (barely conscious, but 
                            happy)
                      S'alright.

      They realize they're still holding each other.  The  *
      awkwardness is palatable.  Suddenly a JANITOR walks in and  *
      they quickly separate.  A beat as the janitor realizes what  *
      he's walked into.  On sight of them he immediately turns and  *
      leaves.    *

      As Rigsby and Van Pelt stand there silently - *


      Jane sitting on his own in the early morning.  Glasses and 
      bandages still on.  He takes off the dark glasses, and slowly 
      starts to remove the bandages.    

      ANGLE -- Lisbon is watching Jane furtively from across the 
      room.  She starts to move closer, not on tiptoes exactly, but 
      she doesn't want him to hear her.    

      Once the bandages are off, Jane keeps his eyes closed for a 
      moment, scared to find out the truth.  Then, slowly, he opens 
      his eyes... and smiles joyously.  

      Jane's POV -- a blur and then the first thing he sees is 
      Lisbon's look of concern turning into a big smile.

                                  JANE
                    You have no notion how good it is 
                    to see your face, Rigsby.

      Lisbon's face drops.

                                  LISBON
                    Rigsby? 

      Jane laughs.  Gotcha.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
