  screw attached by tiny magnet to the + terminal.  As he 
  touches the - terminal with a copper wire, the screw spins.

                This is the perfect way to show 
                that electric and magnetic forces 
                are two sides of the same coin. 

                              DON (O.S.)
                ...You know they ve already 
                invented a tool for that.

  They turn to see Don walking up, carrying a binder.

                              CHARLIE
                Yeah, but this is cooler.  See, the 
                screw is attached to the battery by 
                  a magnet.  The current running 
                through the wire causes it to spin.

                              DON
                This for a classroom show-and-tell?

                Charlie and I are giving a joint

                              CHARLIE
                The magnet s movement is governed 
                by Fleming s Left Hand Rule.

                my father used to pretend we were 
                the people in the painting.  He 
                promised me one day when I was old 
                enough, we d go there, to Paris...

                I hate to disappoint you, but you ve

                wouldn t be thrilled to actually 
                have the painting... You see, the 
                Nazis took everything.  I don t have 
                a single photograph of my family.  
                But when I saw that Pissarro -- it

                What my grandson means is we didn t 
                lose the painting on the merits.  We 
                lost because my memory s failing.

                before.  I never had the courage to 
                  challenge him.  A mistake, perhaps.  

                              CHARLIE
                You re saying I should challenge my 
                father?

                              LARRY
                I m saying that fathers and sons 
                are born at odds.  Literally.  Like 
                staring through a telescope, 
                there s no way you both can see the 
                same object in the same light... 
                All one can do is adjust one s 
                vision.   

  As Charlie considers, Larry spies Charlie s stack of papers.

                              LARRY (cont'd)
                What s with all the red marginalia?

                              CHARLIE
                Our network analysis came up empty.  
                I found all these leads to China, 
                but still there s no sign of the 
                  Pissarro.  I must ve miscalculated.    

                              LARRY 
                Some of the greatest errors in 
                  cosmology have come not from poor 
                math but from poor assumptions.

                              CHARLIE
                What poor assumption?

                              LARRY
                Current wisdom holds that the Nazi 
                  associations have greatly 
                  compromised the prospects for sale 
                of the painting on the blackmarket.

                              CHARLIE
                  Compromised yes, but eliminated no. 

                              LARRY
                But yet you can find no market to 
                which you can trace a sale.

                              CHARLIE
                Right.  China seemed the best bet, 
                but Don s come up empty.

                              LARRY 
                Then perhaps the Pissarro isn t for 
                sale anywhere because for some 
                reason it s just not...  saleable. 

                              CHARLIE
                Even with the taint, the painting s 
                still worth millions -- why 
                wouldn t it be  saleable ?

  Charlie catches sight of one of Larry s copies of a famous 
  masterwork.  This sparks a thought -- his eyes land on the 
    weather-crackled painted table top...

  FLASH CHARLIE VISION

  The table transforms into the Pissarro canvas. The spider-web 
  cracks in the table top mirror cracks in the painting.

  BACK TO SCENE

                              CHARLIE (cont'd)
                ...I ve gotta go.

  Charlie rushes off, leaving his lunch.  Off Larry, taking a 
  pencil and beginning to sketch on a notepad he was carrying.


  Megan and David talk to the museum curator, Arthur Ruiz.  
  WORKERS set up tables, etc. for the upcoming black-tie event.  
  A banner is hoisted:  FRIENDS OF THE MUSEUM GALA. 

                              ARTHUR RUIZ
                ...The Pissarro?  A forgery?  It s 
                not possible. 

                              MEGAN
                Our math consultant did an 
                  extensive analysis, Mr. Ruiz --

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                -- From a photograph.  

                              DAVID
                -- With a computer s enhancement.

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                I m sorry, but whatever consultant 
                you used is mistaken.  

                              MEGAN
                I m afraid there s not much chance 
                of that.

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                There has to be.  This painting 
                underwent an extensive 
                  authentication process when it 
                arrived here a year and a half ago. 

                              MEGAN
                Then what about a switch?  Is it 
                possible someone could ve made a 
                change since the painting s 
                  authentication?

                              ARTHUR RUIZ
                How?  When?  

                              MEGAN
                Well, I m sure the Pissarro s 
                  undergone a cleaning in the last 
                year and a half...

                Under the strict supervision of our 
                  Conservator.  Who by the way also  
                  performed the authentication.

                              DAVID
                And that would have been done on 
                the premises?  

                                ARTHUR RUIZ 
                Yes.  In the restoration department. 

  Megan looks at Ruiz,  let s go. 


  Megan and Tollner.

                              TOLLNER
                Won t be easy finding this guy.  
                I ve met any number of forgers out 
                there capable of work this good.

                              MEGAN
                Could be he s been caught before,  
                maybe even has a file.

                              TOLLNER
                A lot of names to run down.

                              MEGAN
                ...So maybe we don t run down the 
                names, we run down the paintings. 
                      (off his look)
                We have the photo of the forged 
                  Pissarro, right?

                              TOLLNER
                ...And the Bureau maintains a 
                  photographic database of other 
                  forgeries seized over the years.

                              MEGAN 
                So Charlie can run his analysis of 
                our forged Pissarro against other 
                  forgeries in the database.

                              TOLLNER
                If he can tell us Pissarro didn t 
                paint the fake, maybe he can tell 
                us who did.


  ARTHUR RUIZ makes his way through the black-tie fundraiser 
  gala.  Megan and Tollner approach.  He sees them coming.

  Ruiz then notices Holden handcuffed in a doorway, David 
  standing behind him.  Beat.  He looks at Megan and Tollner.

                              MEGAN
                Holden gave you up.

                              ARTHUR RUIZ
                I spent my life devoted to the 
                reputation of this museum... 

                              MEGAN
                Killing a man can t do much for 
                that... 

                              ARTHUR RUIZ
                Wheeler was a charlatan.

                              TOLLNER
                He figured out the painting was a 
                forgery.  Blackmailed you.  That s 
                why you had to kill him.  

  Beat.  Ruiz sees the writing on the wall, tries to explain --

                                ARTHUR RUIZ 
                Do you know how difficult it is for 
                a museum like ours to actually 
                acquire a Pissarro?  

                              MEGAN
                Only you didn t actually acquire a 
                  Pissarro, did you?

                              ARTHUR RUIZ
                The exhibit sold out in a matter of 
                days.  By the time Patrick alerted 
                me to the forgery, it was already 
                too late... The Pissarro had put us 
                on the map.  

                              TOLLNER
                Only the tour next month would have 
                exposed you...

                              ARTHUR RUIZ
                I thought if the painting just... 
                  disappeared; what would be the 
                harm?  Shoemaker had his insurance 
                and the museum had its future.

                              MEGAN
                Not much of a future now.

                Is this really necessary?

  Mrs. Hellman with Joel by her side.  And Don beside a

                              DON
                We contacted the Hungarian police.  
                They delivered the painting to us 
                under guard.

  Don hands her the painting.  She slides it out of the canvas 
  bag.

  Mrs. Hellman gazes intently at the painting, tears welling.
