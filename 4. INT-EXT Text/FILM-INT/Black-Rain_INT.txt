BROWNSTONE APARTMENT
... a miniature Las Vegas, complete with music, drinks,
tuxedoed dealers and croupiers:
roulette, craps, Black
Jack.
Wall to wall people.
The fact that casino gambling
happens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these
Connecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior
wiseguys from having a good time.
AT THE CARD TABLE
NICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a
winning hand.
In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of
quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate.
His Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled
shirt, out of date; Nick could care less.
Two other players are still in the game.
One of them is a
lithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling
friends and tuxedoed men.
The pot is huge.
Nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot.
NICK
One, and one on top.
DEALER
House sees.
PLAYER ONE
(hesitates)
I'm out.
Disgusted, he throws down his cards.
It's down to Nick and the debutante.
The cocky deb gives
Nick a long look, confident she can win.
DEBUTANTE
(her eyes still on
Nick)
I see the deuce, and one to chase
them home.
She throws her chips on the pot.
Nick hesitates, then
decides to match it.
NICK
Call.
DEBUTANTE
(showing her hand)
Ladies, aces wired.
Sorry sport.
Nick turns over his cards, Jacks and tens, not good enough
to win.
Elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins
her giggling friends.
Nick walks over to her.
NICK
Very nice, Barbie.
(pointing toward her
boyfriend)
Now, I'd take Ken over there and go
home.
DEBUTANTE
Why's that?
NICK
It's time.
That's all.
BOYFRIEND
The lady wants to play.
Someone
should teach you to be a better
loser, loser.
NICK
Listen, Ken --
BOYFRIEND
My name is not Ken --
NICK
-- I'm offering you the benefit of
my experience.
DEBUTANTE
Looks like you have a lot of
experience in places like this.
It
was nice of them to relax the dress
code for you.
That draws a laugh from her friends.
The entourage heads
for the bar.
CHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the
debutante, blocking her path.
She steps to the side.
Charlie steps with her.
Charlie's
pushing it, he's always pushing it.
She's not amused.
Finally, Charlie lets her pass.
He comes up to Nick.
CHARLIE
Typical New York woman, big
attitude, small apartment, no tits.
Only two things count to Charlie:
his job and his women,
but not necessarily in that order.
CHARLIE
I think she got to you, pappy.
NICK
(checking his watch)
You want a popsicle, go to Good
Humor.
And don't call me 'pappy.'
CHARLIE
(glancing at the
door)
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd
look in handcuffs.
Nick, wary, eyes this kid.
Charlie shrugs, spreads his
arms defensively.
The SOUND of pounding on the front
door.
THE DOOR
splinters.
The bouncer steps back as four helmeted
emergency service officers -- the first members of the
raiding party -- rush in.
Pandemonium.
People rush for the exit -- any exit.
AT THE BAR
Nick and Charlie hold up their glasses.
NICK
(calmly)
Alley oop.
They down their drinks, then set them down.
Charlie pulls out the Binaca, offering Nick a spritz, but
Nick is already pulling out his POLICE BADGE and hanging
it around his neck.
Charlie quickly follows suit.
A HALF DOZEN COPS
line the patrons up against the wall.
The Asst. D.A.,
PATTY ZACHARA, climbs onto the crap table.
A petite,
nervous woman, Patty has dressed in a Channel suit for the
occasion.
ZACHARA
Settle down.
Hey, quiet... Please.
Not a prayer.
NICK
SHUT THE HELL UP, GODDAMNIT!
That quiets them.
NICK
My name is Conklin.
Let's do this
fast so I can go home.
Zachara, annoyed, looks at Nick.
NICK
(softer)
It's all yours.
ZACHARA
(reads)
Under section 216 of the New York
State Penal code, I serve notice
that this premise and it's
occupants...
NICK
catches the Debutante's eye across the room.
She smiles
at him, he was right.
He shrugs, spreads his hands.
That's life.
A well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as
CAVELLO, suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against
the wall.
Charlie spins around to stop him --
CHARLIE
Whoa -- where do you think you're
going, hotdog.
Cavello butts him with his head, sending Charlie to the
floor.
Then, crosses his arms in front of his face and
plunges through the WINDOW.
Nick, not missing a beat, gives a small sigh as he
follows.
NICK
(sighs)
Fabulous...
He takes off after him.
LOCKER ROOM - TWO EIGHT PRECINCT - NIGHT
Now in their street clothes, Charlie and Nick stand in
front of the mirrors.
Charlie is working his brush and
hair dryer as if his life depended on it.
Nick, in
contrast, shoves his hair back with his fingers and
glowers at himself in the mirror.
CHARLIE
(over the dryer)
... It's not like you were slow or
anything... I think you did just
fine.
I think you did great.
NICK
Thanks.
Nick turns to leave.
CHARLIE
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
NICK
Home.
EL GRECO DINER - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT
A hanger sized roadhouse, wall to wall red velvet.
Nick's the sole figure at the counter, coffee and the
Daily News in front of him.
A NURSE walks in and sits
down a half dozen seats away.
Nick look up.
NICK
Short shift?
CONNIE
Yeah... I came to save you.
If
you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
CUT TO:
CONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Nick and Connie are in bed.
They're both looking up at
the ceiling.
They've just made love.
CONNIE
It's getting too cold even for me,
Nick.
NICK
Connie...
CONNIE
All right, how's the new partner?
NICK
High spirits, desire, commitment.
CONNIE
You'll take care of that.
NICK
Give me a break, would you?
CONNIE
If you give me one.
Nick kisses her.
The first suggestion of real affection.
The SOUND of someone KNOCKING on the door.
Reluctantly,
they stop.
Connie gets up and puts on her robe.
NICK
Are you expecting anyone?
CONNIE
I wasn't expecting you.
She disappears down the hallway.
We HEAR the door open,
then telling someone to wait.
CONNIE
(poking her head in
the room)
Imagine a small, greasy Boy Scout.
CUT TO:
CONNIE'S APARTMENT
Nick, wearing only his pants, is doing a slow burn.
Charlie is holding his hands up defensively.
CHARLIE
... I found the goombah... Cavello.
He's --
NICK
-- I should tear your head off.
CHARLIE
Whoa, I knew you were going to say
that.
I absolutely anticipated
that, Nick.
But I said to myself,
Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on
this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll
be pissed for a moment, but then
it'll dawn on him --
NICK
-- Hey, I got a better chance of
being hit by a bus then moving up.
Charlie looks away momentarily, letting it slide.
He
knows he's on sensitive ground.
CHARLIE
... Look... they told me at the
Greek's you were here.
I'm sorry, I
never imagined...
CHARLIE
(buddy buddy)
I like her.
She's nice.
(lowering his voice)
For her age.
The bedroom door opens.
Connie enters, dumps Nick's
clothes on the couch, tosses his gun on top of the pile.
Without a word, she goes back inside and slams the door
behind her.
Nick, pissed, slowly turns to face Charlie.
Charlie
shrugs.
Nick's got nothing better to do than go.
CUT TO:
LIME HOUSE - CHINATOWN - NIGHT
The Lime House is a little piece of Italy in the heart of
Chinatown, and tonight, it's packed.
Any selection on the
jukebox that isn't Frank Sinatra is Jerry Vale.
Behind
the bar are two fat BROTHERS.
One pours drinks, the other
dishes out Scungilli.
It's three a.m.
It's always three
a.m. at the Lime House.
AT THE BACK TABLE
Our man CAVELLO is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an
already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking
JAPANESE MAN.
The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears
a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out
of place.
A Japanese TRANSLATOR, doing his best to translate
Cavello's heavily accented English, sits between them.
AT THE BAR
Charlie is looking straight ahead, afraid Cavello might
peg him.
Nick is at ease.
CHARLIE
What are they doing now?
NICK
Eating Scungilli, just like the last
time you asked.
CHARLIE
Who do you think the Jap is?
NICK
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru.
How would I know?
CHARLIE
I don't blame you for being sore.
It'll pass when we bag him.
Charlie, trying to relax, gestures toward his foot.
CHARLIE
Whatdaya think?
'Bostonians'.
Eighty-five bucks.
(lowering his voice)
Girls go for shoes.
Second place
they look.
(off Nick's
reaction)
Hey, I read it in a magazine.
Nick's attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door.
NICK
(dead serious)
Charlie, don't do anything.
Promise
me?
CHARLIE
What?
WHAT THEY SEE:
TWO BODYGUARDS are making a quick sweep of
the bar.
FRANK ABOLOFIA, s stocky man with silver grey
hair, sweeps in behind them.
Abolofia has mitts like a
meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure.
A heavyweight
Mafioso.
NICK
Frank Abolofia.
CHARLIE
The Wolf?
Abolofia walks to Cavello's table.
All rise and shake
hands.
The two hitters take seats at the bar.
The two
brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests.
NICK
(in a whisper)
Some party.
CHARLIE
Maybe we should do something?
NICK
Charlie, take your gum, stick it
under your ass and keep it warm.
Nick turns away, resumes his drink.
NICK'S POV IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR:
two new Japanese
men step in the door.
Early twenties, spiky hair, dark
Versace suits.
NUMBER ONE
wears tortoise shell shades.
He coolly checks out the
room then nods to --
NUMBER TWO
who pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his
coat, and spits out three rounds.
A window shatters.
Everyone hits the floor.
NUMBER ONE
slowly walks toward Cavello's table.
NUMBER TWO
covers the floor.
Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty
hands.
NICK AND CHARLIE
on the floor.
They don't have the artillery for this guy
either.
AT THE TABLE
Our Japanese businessman knows these people.
He eyes them
contemptuously.
Abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be
philosophical about it.
He stops chewing.
A tiny
hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any
precipitous action.
NUMBER ONE
(in Japanese)
Give it to me.
The Japanese businessman looking straight ahead.
A long,
silent pause... Then, still not facing him:
BUSINESSMAN
(in Japanese)
Go to hell.
Number One slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging
his eyes.
IN A FLASH, he pulls a shuto from under his
coat.
The 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube.
He presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's
throat.
CHARLIE
his hand close around the grip of the Beretta.
He unsnaps
the ankle holster.
The SNAP can be heard across the room.
Nick's hand closes around Charlie's and squeezes till the
knuckles turn white.
CHARLIE
(in a whisper)
What are you doing?
NICK
Saving your life.
NUMBER TWO
levels the scattergun at Nick and Charlie.
AT THE TABLE - NUMBER ONE
calmly holds the blade at the man's throat as he reaches
into the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular,
plastic-wrapped parcel.
He feels its weight, then flips it to NUMBER TWO.
Abolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't
affect him or his, resumes eating.
ABOLOFIA
You people are wild... Wild.
NUMBER ONE backs the blade off.
The man raises his napkin
to the small wound.
A droplet of blood has stained his
shirt collar.
NUMBER ONE turns around as if to leave.
What happens next could be a whim, an after thought.
Number One spins around and THRUSTS the blade deep into
the man's chest.
He withdraws it with a half twist, and
in the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat
before the old man's body hits the floor.
Blood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his
Scungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the
floor.
CAVELLO
reaches for a gun under his coat.
But NUMBER TWO pumps
two rounds into his face.
At this range, there's not much
left.
The killers slowly back out the door, covering the room
with the scattergun.
The minute the door shuts, Nick
leaps up, pulling his shield and revolver.
NICK
(shouting)
Police officers.
Everybody stay
put.
(to Charlie)
Get back up.
Abolofia's eyebrows rise at this development.
Nick bolts out the door leaving Charlie in charge.
He's
never been in charge before.
CHARLIE
(nervously showing
shield)
Police.
THE LIME HOUSE
Everyone's frozen on the floor.
CHARLIE
Call 911.
Tell them an officer
needs assistance.
Say ten thirteen.
Nothing from the owner who looks at Abolofia.
Charlie
grabs the owner by his collar and shoves him toward the
phone.
CHARLIE
Do it, you dumb bastard!
Suddenly Charlie feels something wet at his feet.
He
looks down to see that he's standing in a pool of blood
from the massacre.
So much for his new shoes.
He wheels around, then quickly backs out the door.
EIGHT - THREE PRECINCT - DAY
CAPT. OLIVER, early forties, walks between Charlie and
Nick as they head toward the Medical Examiner's room.
Oliver doesn't face Nick as he speaks; no love lost
between these two.
OLIVER
How big a package we talking about?
NICK
(holding up his
hands)
This by this...
OLIVER
Dope?
NICK
Not in that company.
OLIVER
The old man was a Japanese paper
manufacturer.
Hotel room and rental
car were full of it.
CHARLIE
Full of what?
OLIVER
(annoyed)
Art and stationary paper.
Cavello
had five hundred thousand in his
attache case.
Nick rubs the back of his neck in obvious pain.
OLIVER
One guy do all the damage?
NICK
Yeah.
OLIVER
Thought you knew your way around
dark alleys, detective.
Oliver goes through the swinging doors into the Examiner's
room.
Charlie shoots Nick a look.
Nick let's it slide.
MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM
A TECHIE is showing the night's harvest to Charlie, Nick
and Oliver.
They're standing over the body of the middle-
aged Japanese man.
TECHIE
... The old man's suit was Japanese.
The hitter's was Saville row.
No
I.D.
We're doing a peel now.
AT ANOTHER TABLE
Another techie is carefully removing the skin from Number
Two's fingertips.
Charlie shuts his eyes and turns away, trying not to throw
up.
TECHIE
There's something you got to see.
He whips back the sheet, the body is nude.
A towel covers
the genitals.
Except for the feet, hands, neck, and face,
the body is covered with elaborate tattoos:
flowers and
blood, dragons and snakes.
TECHIE
What's wrong with this picture?
CHARLIE
(nervously)
I got a tattoo.
Birdie on the ball.
We all got them when we finished
basic at Camp Lejune.
NICK
Charlie.
TECHIE
I thought you guys were trained
observers?
They look up surprised.
The techie picks up a hand.
The
third and forth fingers have been neatly amputated.
TECHIE
Eight fingers.
(ironically)
Hey, it was a trick question.
CUT TO:
INTERROGATION ROOM
ABOLOFIA is seated in chair next to his LAWYER.
Nick,
Oliver, and a third detective are grilling him.
ABOLOFIA
He was with a friend, sure.
I shake
hands with the guy and a minute
later he's bleeding all over my
socks.
ATTORNEY
Will that do officers?
My client
has had a terrible shock.
NICK
Yeah, he's not used to seeing other
people do the killing.
ATTORNEY
I won't tolerate harassment!
OLIVER
What about the package?
ATTORNEY
We know nothing about it.
Silence.
Abolofia looks at Nick, then at Oliver.
ABOLOFIA
Hard to believe a trained police
officer could let this kind of thing
happen right in front of his face.
NICK
I did make a mistake.
I let the
wrong guy get hit.
Abolofia doesn't blink an eye, goes for the jugular.
ABOLOFIA
Cheer up, Nick.
I'm sure it's
easier to pick a dead man's pocket.
Nick springs from his feet.
Oliver grabs Nick before he
can get close to Abolofia.
ATTORNEY
That's it, we're through!
CUT TO:
KOBO
the Japanese killer who smashed in Nick's face last night.
He's sitting in an interrogation room an hour later with a
DETECTIVE and a JAPANESE TRANSLATOR.
He won't talk.
OBSERVATION ROOM
Nick and Oliver watching through the glass.
OLIVER
Doesn't speak a word of English.
And he won't speak Japanese either.
No papers.
The Japanese embassy is
very interested.
NICK
Why?
OLIVER
He's wanted in Japan.
They want him
first.
Then we can have him.
NICK
What?
Oliver nods.
That's the way it is.
ON KOBO
he turns and looks at Nick.
He can't possibly see him
through the one way glass but he knows Nick's there.
ON NICK
looking at him.
ON KOBO
making a cutting mark across his forehead, right where
Nick's bandage is.
It's uncanny.
CUT TO:
OLIVER'S OFFICE - LATER
Nick is sitting in front of Oliver's desk.
The sunlight
makes him wince; wincing makes his face hurt.
OLIVER
Japanese embassy talks to state
department.
State talks to police
plaza.
They to me and me to you.
Shit rolls down hill.
Oliver drops a file folder on the desk.
Nick opens it:
petty cash, vouchers and plane tickets.
OLIVER
You and Charlie are taking the Jap
home, tonight.
NICK
What...?
What if I say no?
OLIVER
Check your gun before you leave.
They're not allowed in Japan.
It's
a nice, safe country.
NICK
Why me?
OLIVER
They said send a detective if I
could spare one.
(then)
I can always spare you.
Nick bridles at the insult.
Oliver's had a hard-on for
Nick for years, and Nick's tired of it.
NICK
(soft)
You got something to say to me,
Captain?
Oliver doesn't want to get into it.
OLIVER
Yeah.
Have a wonderful flight.
CUT TO:
THE ORANGE SUN
on the tail of a Japan Airlines 747.
A driving rain
storm.
The plane taxies down the runway and disappears
into the black rain.
AIRLINER
Kobo, handcuffed and shackled, is in the center seat.
Nick and Charlie sit on either side.
Charlie is holding
"Bachelors Japan" in one hand.
Nick's in a sour mood.
CHARLIE
... Nick, you're the one that's
always saying you never go anywhere.
NICK
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie.
Maybe Vegas.
CHARLIE
What are you missing?
Riding your
motorcycle to the nurse's house.
That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
NICK
Beats forty hours on a plane.
CHARLIE
They say we got to turn around and
come right back.
That's what they
say.
I got a plan.
The last thing Nick wants to hear -- too late.
CHARLIE
I call, right?
I say I got the
dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits
from some raw clam and we stretch it
into three days.
You and I become a
driving force on the local Geisha
scene.
NICK
Not a prayer.
CHARLIE
(grinning)
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop
from New York.
You're gonna be the
biggest thing to hit town since
Godzilla.
Nick can't help but smile at this kid.
Charlie looks down
at the guide book.
CHARLIE
Says here, it's very impolite to
touch someone while you're talking
to them...
(nudges Kobo)
Guess that means you can't talk and
screw at the same time, huh, hotdog?
What's the matter, no -- speaky-the-
language?
Understand this:
You
will never ever fuck with my partner
again.
Nothing from Kobo who is looking straight ahead.
He
doesn't understand.
NICK
Shut-up, Charlie.
A beat, then Charlie reads a Japanese phrase from the
book.
A slight facial response from Kobo.
Charlie tries
it again.
This time Kobo laughs openly.
NICK
What'd you say?
CHARLIE
Where is the subway station, please.
Kobo keeps laughing; it's obviously not what Charlie said.
NICK
Get a new book.
CUT TO:
AIRLINER - LATER
The cabin is now darkened.
Kobo and Nick are asleep.
Not
Charlie, he's still at his book, and listening to U2 on
his Walkman.
Nick rolls over and opens his eyes to see
Charlie watching him.
He shuts them hoping to avoid talk.
Too late.
CHARLIE
Nick... You up?
NICK
No.
Charlie removes his headphones.
CHARLIE
Nick, have I been a good partner?
NICK
Number five with a bullet.
Nick shuts his eyes.
CHARLIE
I just want you to know... I mean
anybody who says you ever took has
got to deal with me.
NICK
Go to sleep, Charlie.
CHARLIE
You didn't take, did you...?
You
hear things.
Nick opens his eyes.
NICK
I worked the three nine in Queens,
Charlie.
CHARLIE
(surprised)
I didn't know.
NICK
The lieutenant was on the pad along
with the rest of the squad.
I was
new, didn't know shit.
When the
feathers flew, I got called in front
of the special prosecutor.
It's on
the top of my personnel file.
They
think I'm dirty or I cut a deal.
Doesn't leave you with a lot of
friends either way.
Nick shuts his eyes.
NICK
I might as well have done something.
I've been paying for it every
goddamn day since I got
transferred...
HOLD on Nick then...
CUT TO:
NARITA AIRPORT - JAPAN - DAY
Nick and Charlie, with Kobo between them, are a strange
sight in a sea of Japanese faces.
Kobo's hands are cuffed
behind his back.
Nick also has Kobo cuffed to his wrist.
The cops are rumpled, exhausted, showing two days of
stubble.
Kobo looks sharp and wide awake.
A pair of attractive teenage girls walks past them.
CHARLIE
Whoa.
Nick, we're in paradise.
A PAIR
of white gloved hands belonging to a Tokyo police officer
holds up a small, hand letter sign that says:
CONKLIN/SKLOARIS.
The man holding the sign is NAGASHIMA.
Two other police officers in spotless tan uniforms stand
at his side.
Nick, holding Kobo by his arm, steps up to the police and
show his I.D.
Nagashima bows.
NAGASHIMA
Officers Conklin and -- and...
(he can't say
Charlie's name)
... gentlemen, welcome.
I am
assistant inspector Nagashima.
They show their I.D.
NICK
You going to take this crap off our
hands?
NAGASHIMA
(confused)
Crap...?
Oh, the prisoner.
Yes.
He barks some orders to the officers who immediately take
Kobo by the arms and put cuffs on him.
Nick unfastens
his cuff when they're through.
In contrast to Nagashima's gentility, the cops are rough
with the prisoner.
CHARLIE
(extends his hand)
Charlie.
Kon-ich-iwa.
Nagashima shakes his hand.
Bows.
Charlie bows back.
Nick wouldn't bow if his life depended on it.
Nagashima
hands Nick an official looking document.
NAGASHIMA
If you will please give this to the
customs inspector he will expidate
-- expedite you.
We have a car and
a driver outside.
NICK
Right.
CHARLIE
(bows)
Arigato.
Nick grabs Charlie by the arm and starts for the customs
line.
NICK
Givin' you a book is like givin' a
baby a gun.
CHARLIE
Hey, when in Rome --
NICK
In Rome, I'll bow.
CUT TO:
CUSTOMS BOOTH - DAY
NICK and CHARLIE make their way through the crowd toward
the head of a long line.
They dump their bags on the
counter.
The INSPECTOR, furious that they have taken cuts
in line, barks at them in Japanese.
NICK
Inspector Nagashima told me to give
you this.
He hands the Inspector the official looking document.
The
Inspector scans the paper.
Hands it back to them.
INSPECTOR
(broken English)
You must get in line behind the
rest.
NICK
We're cops.
Pol-ice-men.
The Inspector signals a nearby POLICEMAN.
The Inspector
says something in Japanese.
Hands the policeman the
document.
The policeman shakes his head, amused, points
to the end of the line.
NICK
Fellas, get serious.
From off screen someone CALLS OUT:
MAN (O.S.)
Nick!
Nick and Charlie turn to see KOBO, their prisoner,
standing on the other side of the thick plastic divider.
The handcuffs are off.
The three alleged 'policemen' are
heading out the door behind him.
It was a set-up:
Nick
and Charlie have been had.
KOBO
(perfect English)
Thanks for the ride, detective.
He slowly backs away from the glass as if he had all the
time in the world, finally disappearing in the crowd.
CUT TO:
NICK AND CHARLIE
trying to shove past the customs inspectors who are
wrestling them aside.
NICK
Cops!
He's our prisoner!
Two more policemen arrive.
Nick and Charlie are thrown up
against the wall.
Out come the cuffs.
SNAP!
NICK
What's going on?
We're the good
guys!
CUT TO:
TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY
Fifty identical desks.
Fifty identical phones.
Fifty
identically dressed men in white shirts and ties working
under the fluorescent lights of this large open room.
We GLIDE PAST the rows of desk to find INSPECTOR OHASHI,
mid forties, sitting behind a perfectly arranged desk.
Ohashi prides himself on order.
Nick and Charlie are standing in front of him.
NICK
Get me something like an Identi-Kit
and I'll give you a description.
Ohashi remains poker faced.
He continues to arrange
papers and apply his hanko (personal seal) to the bottom
of a stack of official papers.
CHARLIE
There must be some witnesses from
the airport?
Still nothing from the good inspector.
NICK
What is it, tea time?
Still nothing from Ohashi.
Finally:
OHASHI
(quiet rage)
You lost a man we wanted for some
time.
It was very incompetent on
your part, officer.
NICK
Incompetent is letting people waltz
through a secure area wearing your
uniforms, carrying official
documents.
Ohashi bows slightly, we're not sure why.
NICK
I want a gun.
OHASHI
It is not allowed.
NICK
We're police officers.
OHASHI
You're foreigners.
NICK
Work with me.
I want your best
detective.
Pause.
Ohashi returns to his papers.
Nick can't believe
it.
NICK
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to
take the rap for this.
OHASHI
(not looking up)
Do you know what this is?
Ohashi holds up the document that was handed to Nick at
the airport.
OHASHI
It's a laundry list.
Go home,
detective.
Nick studies him for a beat, then turns away.
To Charlie:
NICK
Let's go.
CHARLIE
Nick, we can't just --
NICK
I said let's go, Charlie.
Reluctantly they head towards the door, passing long rows
of bureaucrats, telephones ringing off the hook.
Nick
stops at the door, spots a fuse box nearby.
He glances
back to make sure no one is looking.
Nick pulls out his handcuffs.
Charlie can't figure out
what the hell he's doing.
Nick attaches one cuff to the
main lever then yanks it down.
The lights go out.
The fan's stop; so do the typewriters;
so does the air conditioning.
Dead silence.
Nick attaches the other cuff to a pipe, snaps it shut.
Now it's impossible to left the main lever.
From the far end of the room:
OHASHI
What are you doing?!
Nick drops the key down the water fountain drain.
NICK
Your best detective, Ohashi.
CUT TO:
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY
The boys are knocking on a door.
Nick turns the handle.
It's unlocked.
THE APARTMENT
A four tatami room.
An unholy mess:
Food packages, beer
bottles, stacks of papers and file folders.
Framed
pictures of long dead relatives hang on the wall.
CHARLIE
This the right place?
NICK
I hope not.
A WOMAN now appears at the door.
Middle aged, wizened
face, in a full traditional Kimono.
CHARLIE
Konichiwa.
Ichiro Matsumoto?
The woman babbles bird-like in rapid Japanese.
She bows.
They're in the right place.
CUT TO:
ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - KABUKI CHO - NIGHT
Imagine an ultra modern indoor shopping mall, except there
aren't any stores.
The only product sold here is
pleasure:
Bars, hostess clubs, Turkish baths.
A post-
modern red light district with music piped in and
automated doormen.
LAS VEGAS WELCOME CLUB
Hip, younger Japanese are wedged together at the long
chrome bar.
The GUYS sport leather jackets and Raybans.
The GIRLS are decked out in fifties American party dresses
and short cropped hair.
Jerry Lee Lewis wails in the
background.
Nick, Ich and Charlie are at one end of the long bar.
Ich
is drinking them both under the table.
ICH
(singing)
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of
fire."
(raising glass for
toast)
To the killer.
Jerry Lee Lewis.
NICK
(checking his watch)
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo
And The Don't's.
Let's book,
Charlie.
If he starts on Motown,
we'll be here all night.
ICH
No, this is the place for the young
Yakuza.
NICK
That's what you said in the last
three piss pots.
Ich sets down his drink, pours more sake for Nick and
Charlie then for himself.
He's having a great time.
ICH
I love you people.
The music, the
clothes, the movies... Japanese
respect only what is Japanese.
Nick glances at Charlie.
NICK
It's incredible.
Hit him or
something.
CHARLIE
I don't think he'd feel it.
ICH
(beginning to slur
his words)
Americans change everything.
When I
was young the city was wood and
paper... I was ten when the bombers
came.
I lived underground for three
days.
When I came up, the city was
gone... A ball of fire.
Nick gets to his feet.
Ich grabs him by the arm, stopping
him.
ICH
It began to rain, Nick.
You know
what color the rain was?
Ich doesn't give him a chance to answer.
ICH
Black... It was black from the ash.
Very impressive.
You Americans, you
could make black rain.
Ich polishes off his drink.
An awkward silence.
Charlie,
wanting to lighten the mood --
CHARLIE
(leaning close)
Say Ich, between friends, where can
I grab some squish around here?
Nick sighs, digs in his pocket for some yen for the bill.
ICH
Squid?
CHARLIE
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Ich looks up to see a picturesque, blood-haired American
WOMEN in a tight silk blouse and skirt.
She works here
and has obviously heard Charlie.
ICH
Ah, Joyce...
(in Japanese)
How are you tonight?
JOYCE
(in Japanese)
Hello, Ich.
Johnny Walker?
Ich nods.
Joyce's Japanese is impeccable.
She's a part-
time bartender, translator, model.
One of Japan's western
wanderers.
She's sliding past thirty, but only her weary
eyes give it away.
She is about to pour Ich another
drink.
NICK
Don't give him any more.
JOYCE
He gets as much as he wants.
Charlie extends his hand to Joyce.
She ignores it.
CHARLIE
Hello hello, Charlie Skloaris.
New
York City.
She refills Ich's glass.
CHARLIE
My partner and I are cops.
(lowering his voice)
We're on a very big assignment here.
(nothing from Joyce)
When do you get off?
JOYCE
Right when you're being tucked into
bed.
Cold.
ICH
You should be nicer to my American
friends, Joyce.
JOYCE
They wouldn't appreciate it, Ich.
Trust me.
She says something in Japanese to Ich as she eyes the
cops.
Then, she walks off.
ICH
Joyce can be nice.
CHARLIE
(brightening)
What'd she say?
ICH
(big smile)
That I should let you pay for the
drinks.
(raising his glass)
Kampai.
CUT TO:
HOTEL ROOM
Nick and Charlie are sacked out.
They never bothered to
pull the curtains.
THE SOUND OF KNOCKING at the door.
ICH (O.S.)
Nick!
NICK
Give us a break...
ICH (O.S.)
It's Ichiro.
Ich.
NICK
Leave the rice cake outside and go
home!
But Ich persists.
AT THE DOOR
As Nick opens up.
Ich bows.
He's now clean shaven and
has put on a clean shirt.
ICH
There's been a murder.
Yakuza.
You
should come.
CUT TO:
PRINTING PLANT - DAY
The murder scene.
NO SOUND.
A SERIES OF SHOTS:
A BODY FROM THE WAIST DOWN in the claws of six foot
working robotic.
The tattooed covered legs swing back and
forth like a pendulum.
THE TORSO is wedged in between two enormous printing
rollers.
THE HEAD is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt.
It's been drenched in black printer's ink which has begun
to congeal.
WE SLOWLY TRACK PAST Ich, Charlie, and Nick, watching.
Charlie has the dry heaves.
REAL SOUND as we reveal the full crime scene.
Instead of
the usual cigar smoke, camera flashes and radio chatter,
there is order and quiet.
A slow underwater dance.
INSPECTOR OHASHI
quietly gives an order.
Someone turns off the robotic.
The severed legs stop swinging.
Nick, Charlie and Ich walk over to Ohashi.
Ich bows
deeply.
Ohashi doesn't acknowledge any of them, talks to
a man holding a tape measurer.
NICK
Could you fill me in?
OHASHI
Why don't you ask your chief
detective?
Ich looks down at the floor.
NICK
Because I want you to tell me.
OHASHI
The young are eating the old,
something that usually doesn't
happen here.
NICK
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
Ohashi pauses.
Ich looks at Nick as if to warn him he
can't speak to Ohashi that way.
OHASHI
There's a war, detective, between
two rival groups.
The man who
escaped, Kobo, leads the younger
group.
They did this.
ICH
Kobo's a wild boy.
He was a
lieutenant in the Sammaguchi-gummi.
OHASHI
(in Japanese)
Excellent, Officer Matsumoto.
How
is your investigation going?
ICH
(in Japanese)
Well, sir.
Thank you for giving me
the opportunity to work with these
distinguished gentlemen.
He bows.
It's pathetic.
POLICE LIEUTENANT
Looking for clues in the bottom of a
sake bottle, Matsumoto?
Laughter all around.
OHASHI
He's an officer of great
distinction.
Another sarcastic dig.
Ich stoically stands and takes it.
CHARLIE
Hey, Ich has been helpful.
OHASHI
(ignoring him, to
Nick)
Have you changed your mind and
decided to go home, detective?
NICK
Not until one of us bags Kobo.
(looking at the
corpse)
And it doesn't look like you're
doing so hot.
Ohashi coolly flicks the ashes of his cigarette and we --
CUT TO:
SUBWAY STATION
Nick, Ich and Charlie are riding the people mover that
stretches the length of this endless tunnel.
They're
sandwiched between the legions of SALARYMEN (white collar
workers) who all wear identical blue suits and white
shirts.
Nick looks over at Ich, who is still suffering in silence
from the recent humiliation.
NICK
You know, Inspector, you take shit
once, you take shit forever.
ICH
(beat)
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
NICK
Why the hell not?
ICH
I don't, that's all.
Ich looks away, obviously uncomfortable.
CHARLIE
You cool, Ich?
ICH
Cool?
CHARLIE
You all right?
You okay?
Ich nods.
CHARLIE
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
ICH
(smiling)
What does Charlie mean?
CHARLIE
Hey, all right.
Charlie slaps Ich on the back.
NICK smiles at Charlie's remark.
He can't help but like
this wide-eyed goofy kid.
Something makes Nick's smile fade.
NICK'S POV
KOBO, their escaped prisoner, hurrying in the opposite
direction.
His Kamali suit looks like it just came from
the cleaners.
NICK
Charlie!
Charlie spots him.
In a flash, the two men jump the
railing and charge after him, leaving Ich in their wake.
Ich can't possibly make it over the side.
He furiously
shoves his way through the Salarymen, trying to get to the
end of the walkway.
CHASE SEQUENCE
-- Nick barreling through the mass of faceless Salarymen.
-- Kobo, hurrying ahead, occasionally glancing back.
-- Charlie catching up to Nick.
They've lost him.
They
spin around.
A half dozen tunnels spin out in all
directions.
-- Nick and Charlie spotting Kobo.
He's waiting for them
near the turnstile.
Nick suddenly realizes it's a set-up.
Before he can say
anything, Charlie sprints ahead, recklessly shoving
people out of the way.
NICK
(calling after him)
It's a set-up...!
Charlie!
Charlie hasn't heard him.
AT THE TURNSTILE
Kobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears
onto the platform.
Charlie doesn't have a ticket.
The
guard points to the automatic ticket machine.
Screw it.
Charlie leaps over the turnstile.
The GUARD blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway
police.
THE PLATFORM
Charlie pushes through the crowd -- a wall of blank faces.
Kobo is gone.
NICK
shoving through the crowd.
He spots Charlie.
Shouts at
him to wait.
Charlie can't hear his partner.
THE SUBWAY
pulls in.
An immaculately uniformed CONDUCTOR blows his
whistle and waves his white-gloved hands to keep the crowd
back.
A LEATHER JACKETED BOY shoves Charlie from behind; he
stumbles forward toward the track.
Someone catches him at
the last moment.
Charlie turns around to see it's Kobo.
Kobo smiles, it's all a big joke.
What follows happens in a flash:
ON NICK
NICK
Charlie!
Nick is close enough to see, too far to do anything.
He's
blocked by TWO MORE LEATHER BOYS.
He tries to shove past,
but they grab him.
KOBO
holding Charlie by his coat lapels.
An express train
tears into the station.
Kobo casually glances at
NICK
trying to struggle free.
KOBO
his eyes still on Nick, drops Charlie in front of the
speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry.
NICK
NICK
NO!!
A woman SCREAMS.
The train barrels through the station.
Kobo starts toward Nick.
He's next.
A pair of SUBWAY POLICEMEN burst through the crowd
searching for Charlie because he vaulted the turnstile.
NICK
manages to break free of the leatherboys holding him.
They flee into the crowd as the police close in.
ACROSS THE PLATFORM - KOBO
slips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a
train by white-gloved MEN.
It's their job to shove
commuters into the already packed cars.
Nick goes for Kobo, but the crowd closes in front of him.
He can't get through.
THE SUBWAY DOORS
slam shut.
The train pulls out leaving Nick standing on
the empty platform.
THE LAST CAR
streaks past him.
Kobo stands in the rear window, getting
smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the
tracks.
ICH
Nick!
Ich, out of breath, is standing on the platform.
Nick
looks at him with disgust -- where the hell was he.
STAY on Nick, his head bowed, being surrounded by the sea
of blue-suited commuters.
FADE TO WHITE.
FADE IN:
NICK'S FACE against a white wall.
That's all we see.
Ohashi's voice OFF SCREEN.
OHASHI (O.S.)
... You ignored me.
I don't care
about what you want.
Get on a
plane, detective Conklin.
Go home.
We HEAR a door open and SLAM shut off screen.
Hold on
Nick, frozen in place, then:
CUT TO:
CENTRAL SECTION - TOKYO POLICE H.Q. - DAY
Again, the fifty desks, fifty faceless men working.
Typewriters CLACKING, phones RINGING.
We MOVE down the
rows to find Nick sitting behind one of the desks.
He's
on the phone to New York.
OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
It's not your job.
NICK
He was my partner.
OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
They're blaming it on you.
Christ,
Conklin, you didn't even tell me you
lost the prisoner!
NICK
I planned on catching him, Captain.
OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
How?
You don't know the place.
You
don't know the language.
Get on the
plane.
NICK
He killed a police officer.
OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
Your plane's at nine a.m.
Be on it.
That's orders.
Period.
Oliver hangs up.
A moment of long distance hum cross
talk.
Nick doesn't move.
Pull back through the rows of
cops busily working... SOUND FADES.
Charlie Parker's alto sax FADE UP as we --
CUT TO:
PUBLIC BATH - DAY
The neighborhood bathhouse.
Thick with steam and
neighborhood kids.
Nick walks toward the huge pool of water.
Ich is beside
him.
Nick's about to climb in when Ich stops him, hands
him a pail and a washcloth and points to the faucets along
the wall where a dozen men squat on small stools as they
wash themselves.
CUT TO:
NICK
as he pours a pail of water over his head, it runs down
his face in slow motion.
CUT TO:
THE POOL
Nick soaking, on one side.
Ich is soaking nearby.
ICH
You must leave?
NICK
Yeah...
ICH
I'll get him for you, Nick.
Nick looks at this thick bellied, alcoholic cop.
Not a
very reassuring thought.
TWO MEN carrying plastic pails cross in front of the tub.
Young, muscular Yakuza, their bodies covered with
exquisite tattoos.
They stare openly at Nick.
One makes
a joke.
Both laugh obscenely as they slip into the hot
tub.
NICK
Yakuza?
Ich nods.
Nick eyes them for a long beat, then climbs out
of the tub.
CUT TO:
NICK
Nick tossing two bags into a taxi in front of Ich's
apartment building.
ICH
Ich watching Nick through the window from inside his
apartment.
He glances back and sees Charlie's "Members
Only" coat hanging on a hook.
When he turns back, Nick's taxi has disappeared.
LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - AFTERNOON
Only a handful of patrons.
Joyce is straightening bottles
behind the bar.
NICK (O.S.)
What's tricks?
She looks up, surprised to see Nick standing in front of
her.
JOYCE
Ich said you left.
NICK
There was a change in plans.
Beat.
JOYCE
I'm sorry about your friend.
Nick's surprised at how fast she heard.
JOYCE
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
NICK
Gaiijin?
JOYCE
An outside person.
A foreigner.
A
barbarian.
You, me.
(beat)
More you.
NICK
I could use some help.
Show me
around.
I'll pay you for your time.
JOYCE
I don't give tours.
Nick smiles.
NICK
You can count on the truth from
people who don't like you.
JOYCE
You have a helluva way of asking for
help.
NICK
You have a helluva way of answering.
Draw.
JOYCE
Look, you need Ich.
I've been here
five years and I still can't read
all the street signs.
NICK
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
JOYCE
I don't think so.
From OFF SCREEN:
ICH (O.S.)
Nicklaus-san.
Nick turns to see Ich, leaning against the door frame.
He's already had a few drinks too many.
He's delighted to
see Nick.
ICH
I've continued working on the case!
NICK
I can see that.
Ich ambles into the room, slips down into a chair.
He
spills the contents of the large manila envelope he's been
carrying onto the table:
a wallet, a set of keys, playing
cards, etc.
ICH
(signaling to Joyce)
Joyce... A drink please.
(to Nick)
Kobo has disappeared.
My superiors
don't trust me.
Nick walks over to the table and looks at the items.
ICH
Kobo's.
Taken off him when he was
arrested in New York.
Nick sits down.
Joyce gives Ich his scotch.
ICH
I knew you'd come back.
You feel
you have a debt you can never pay.
But you will, even if it costs you
your life.
Giri.
Honor.
Nick picks up various items off the table.
NICK
How'd you get this?
ICH
I stole them.
Ich drapes his arm over Nick's shoulder.
ICH
Partners, Nicklaus-san?
Ich reaches for his drink.
Nick gets there first.
He
holds it up as if he were proposing a toast, then
purposefully spills his drink out.
NICK
Partners.
Ich has just had his last drink on duty.
CUT TO:
THE TABLE - LATER
All the contents of the envelope are spread out on the
table:
credit cards, matchbooks from New York City,
choice clipping from Screw magazine, sugarless gum, cuff
links...
Nick's holding up a series of photos.
CLOSE ON PHOTO
of a naked women and Kobo screwing on a Tatami mat.
Another photo.
Then another.
Each photo is more
pornographic than the next.
Joyce picks them up as Nick sets them down.
JOYCE
Busy man.
Nick holds out several of the same girl in various poses.
NICK
Know her?
ICH
(shaking his head)
We can ask someone I used to work
with.
A criminal.
Someone I pay
money to...
NICK
A snitch?
CUT TO:
PACHINKO PARLOR - DAY
The largest in Tokyo.
Endless rows of men sitting in
front of the machines (horizontal pinball games) furiously
punching the flippers.
The NOISE from the metal balls is
deafening.
A MAN
in a Hawaiian shirt, his arms covered with tattoos, is
starting a new game.
Ich moves up to the vacant machine beside him, puts in his
change.
Ich doesn't face the man as they speak in
Japanese.
The man in the Hawaiian shirt walks off.
ON NICK
as the man in the Hawaiian shirt walks past him.
This is
the snitch.
Nick glances back at Ich.
Ich nods --
they're in business.
CUT TO:
A CRAMPED ROOM - REAR OF PACHINKO PARLOR
We HEAR the clattering of the machines outside.
The man
in the Hawaiian shirt, mid-fifties and badly in need of a
shower, is sitting on the floor studying the photos.
Ich
and Nick tower above him.
The man says something to Nick in Japanese, then continues
to study the photos.
NICK
What's he saying?
ICH
(looking up)
He says they're very nice.
He wants
to know if you have anymore.
Nick sighs.
ICH
I'll ask him again.
Ich asks in Japanese.
The man shrugs.
NICK
My turn.
He grabs the man by his shirt collar and shoves him
against the wall.
The photos spill to the floor.
NICK
Who is she?
He bangs the man's head back against the wall.
The man
starts babbling in Japanese.
Ich, horrified, tries to pull Nick off him.
ICH
Nick, stop.
Nick bangs the snitches head against the wall again.
Ich
gets Nick away.
The man is terrified.
ICH
This man must be treated with
respect.
Ich bows to the man, apologizes in Japanese.
NICK
Aw, for Christ's sake.
They continue speaking in Japanese.
They bow to one
another again.
Ich gives the man a glass of water, then
motions for him to sit down.
Nick, impatient, starts for the guy again.
Ich stops him.
The snitch holds up one of the photos, and starts
babbling.
NICK
(to Ich)
Now we're making progress.
CUT TO:
SEIBU DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
CLOSE ON A SALESGIRL behind the cosmetic counter.
She is
wearing the store uniform:
blue and white dress and white
gloves.
A doll.
We shouldn't recognize her at first.
Then --
INSERT A PHOTO
one of Kobo's porno pics.
It's the same face.
REVEAL NICK
holding the photo, standing in the crowded store.
Ich is
beside him.
NICK
That's Kobo's girl?
He's sure?
Ich glances back at the man in the Hawaiian shirt standing
by the door.
The man nods.
ICH
He's sure.
They watch the girl help a customer choose an eyeliner.
ICH
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three
days.
He might not even be in
Tokyo.
NICK
Only one way to find out... Get her
up in the morning and put her to bed
at night.
CUT TO:
SOBA RESTAURANT - DAY
NICK
is struggling with his chopsticks and bowl of noodles.
From O.S. A LOUD SLURPING SOUND.
The sound stops, then
starts again.
Nick can't eat.
He sets his bowl down and
looks over at
ICH
slurping his noodles.
It is considered polite to slurp
soba noodles as loud as possible.
Ich stops.
Looks at Nick, then resumes his slurping.
NICK
Think you could keep it to a dull
roar?
They're sitting by the window across from the Seibu
department store watching the entrance.
ICH
It's good manners.
Nick nods.
Picks up his bowl.
Again the LOUD slurping
off screen.
Nick starts to eat the noodles.
He can't
continue with Ich slurping.
He sets the bowl down.
Ich grins, resumes slurping and we --
CUT TO:
HALLWAY - GIRL'S APARTMENT BUILDING
Ich, tucking in his shirt, comes down the hall to see --
Nick, on his knees, examining the lock on the girl's
apartment door.
He slides his NYPD card into the jam and
lightly raps the knob plate.
ICH
You can't do this.
Nick uses his sleeve to wipe prints off the knob and jam.
NICK
Call a cop.
The door swings open.
Nick walks in.
CUT TO:
GIRL'S APARTMENT
A cheesebox with a few vintage pieces of American deco
furniture.
Ich, very uptight, stands at the door while Nick goes over
the place.
Nick opens the closet.
It's packed with expensive
dresses, pants, sweaters...
ICH
Nick...
NICK
(facing him)
If you're gonna give me a hard time,
wait outside.
Nick goes through her chest of drawers:
on the top, a lot
of high quality lingerie.
INSERT PHOTO:
The girl and Kobo posing in a vintage
Corvette.
Nick replaces the picture, and carefully rearranges the
drawer so it appears untouched.
He pulls open another
drawer.
Then another.
Under the jeans and Mickey Mouse
T-shirts, he finds:
A BANK STACK OF U.S. CURRENCY
in hundreds.
The bottom of the drawer is lined with
stacks.
Nick holds them up for Ich to see.
NICK
Not too shabby for a perfume pusher.
Ich, shocked, tries to play it cool.
ICH
Too bad it's not in yen.
Nick shoves the drawer shut.
CUT TO:
THE GIRL - DUSK - TWO DAYS LATER
The GIRL buys fruit from a stand as NICK watches from one
end of the block; ICH, listening to his transistor radio,
waits at the other.
THE GIRL
suddenly turns and finds herself facing
NICK
a few yards away.
Nick smiles, then walks into the
store, hoping he hasn't been made.
DISSOLVE TO:
STOREROOM - NIGHT
Nick, leaning against the wall, watches the girl's
apartment across the street.
The girl walks in, turns on
her light, then disappears into the bathroom.
Ich walks in, exhausted, soaked to the skin.
He tosses
his cap in the corner.
Struck out again.
ICH
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry...
Fabulous...
NICK
(looking back out
the window)
Four goddamn days.
This is going
nowhere...
A KNOCK at the door.
JOYCE (O.S.)
It's me.
Ich opens the door.
Joyce, dressed for work, is carrying
two odons (box dinners).
Joyce and Ich exchange greetings
in Japanese.
JOYCE
What's the latest?
Nick shrugs.
ICH
We'll get him, Joyce.
Joyce peeks out the window.
The girl is getting
undressed.
JOYCE
She ever pull down her shades?
NICK
(right back at her)
Sure, but then I just pull out the
photos.
Ich opens one of the box dinners and sets it on the ledge
in front of Nick.
ICH
(enthusiastically)
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku,
Ganmodoki --
NICK
Ichiro --
ICH
(realizing)
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll,
soybean curd, devils tongue --
NICK
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Joyce hands Ich a flask of hot sake in tinfoil.
NICK
Whoa whoa...
Nick grabs the flask.
Dumps it out the window.
JOYCE
Don't be an ass.
NICK
He's on duty.
JOYCE
I paid for that.
Nick tosses a few thousand yen on the table.
Then,
spotting something out the window.
NICK
Alley oop!
Nick grabs his coat and goes out the door.
Joyce slips
Ich another flask of sake.
CUT TO:
HOSTESS CLUB
Packed with Salarymen from the nearby brewery and
hostesses in silk dresses selling cheap champagne at
expensive prices.
NICK AND ICH
Walk in.
Everything seems normal.
The BOUNCER in a white tux, stops them.
This is not a
place frequented by Gaiijin.
Ich beseeches the Bouncer to let his good friend in,
promising that his friend will spend lots of money.
Nick, thinking he's in, takes a step forward.
The Bouncer
shoves him back.
NICK
Hey, no hands, huh?
He bats his hands away.
Ich grabs Nick by the shoulders,
preventing a fight.
ICH
You can't come in.
They don't
want --
NICK
Gaiijin.
ICH
I'll check it out.
Nick, unsure, turns to go, but before he does:
NICK
If I smell one drop of Scotch on
your breath, my friend --
ICH
You can trust me.
Nick hesitates, he's not so sure, then shoves the door
open.
HOSTESS CLUB - LATER
Ich is sitting at the crowded bar.
A HOSTESS has her arm
around his neck.
He checks out the room, searching for
the girl.
He notices two THUGS standing outside a sliding
door.
Ich finishes his drink.
ICH
(in Japanese)
Let me up.
HOSTESS
(shoving him down)
Sit, sweetie.
(to bartender)
Another Seagrams!
Ich relents.
Then, spotting something across the room:
WHAT HE SEES:
A rice paper door slides open, momentarily
revealing a DOZEN men with close cropped hair sitting on
tatami mats, playing poker.
Some have their coats off,
revealing arms covered with tattoos.
Yakuza.
A hostess, serving drinks, steps but leaving the door
partially open.
The hostess slides the door open to the adjacent room, but
Ich CANNOT see inside.
She slides it shut.
Ich's hostess wants him to buy another drink, but Ich
shakes his head, gets to his feet, and pretending to be
drunk, stumbles toward the sliding doors.
Ich bumps into a table; slaps a stranger on the shoulder;
then starts singing along with Frank Sinatra on the
stereo.
He's a little too loud, a little off key.
The bodyguards eye Ich suspiciously.
He stumbles past
them, then grabs the sliding door and yanks it open.
INSIDE THE ROOM
A low table.
Kobo is at one end.
An older,
distinguished, sliver-haired man in his seventies whom we
will come to know as SUGAI is at the other.
Ich can't
believe his eyes:
Sugai is the head of the largest Yakuza
syndicate in Japan.
A half dozen LIEUTENANTS sit on either side of the table.
Half are older, dressed in conservative suits; the other
half are younger wearing $700 Issy Miyake jackets.
SUGAI AND KOBO
are having a heated discussion.
The GIRL Ich and Nick
have been following walks over to Kobo and sits beside
him.
This makes Sugai even more irate.
He's on his feet,
red faced and screaming.
FOUR GUARDS
seeing Ich, pull out their Beretta's.
Two more grab him
and fling him head first against the wall.
ICH
(drunken, in Japanese)
I have to piss, gentlemen... I'm so
sorry but I have to --
The bodyguards hurry him towards the door.
HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT
Ich hurries in, but Nick's long gone.
ICH'S BATHROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER
Nick, standing beside the tub, dumps a pail of hot water
over his head, rinsing himself off.
He grabs a towel and
walks out of the room.
ICH'S APARTMENT
Ich, holding an ice pack to his face, is lying on a tatami
mat against the wall looking up at the ceiling.
An open
bottle of Seagrams beside him.
Nick stretches out on another tatami on the opposite side
of the room and looks up at the ceiling, too.
NICK
The ice help?
Nothing from Ich.
NICK
Where does this Sugai live?
ICH
(cold)
A resort city, Beppu.
NICK
I want to go talk to him.
ICH
What...?
Why?
NICK
Because he knows how to get to our
man.
ICH
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
NICK
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Nick gets up and goes to the closet.
He slides open the
door.
All of his and Charlie's clothes have been neatly
hung up.
He shoves Charlie's jacket aside.
Something's wrong with
the way it hangs.
He pulls the jacket out, runs his hand
over the coat, feeling something heavy in the lining.
Nick rips the lining open.
Charlie's .32 Beretta and a
spare clip tumble out.
NICK
The little bastard.
God bless him.
Ich takes a drink from his bottle.
ICH
It's very small.
NICK
Big enough.
ICH
It's illegal, Nick.
NICK
It's a new deal.
(putting it in his
waist band)
... coming with me tomorrow?
ICH
Sugai's not going to be impressed
with your gun, Nick.
(beat)
No.
I won't put myself in danger
for you anymore.
Nick picks up the liquor cap which rolled across the
floor.
He tosses it to Ich.
Ich reaches for it, but
misses.
NICK
Sure, pal.
You've got better things
to do.
Nick walks out shutting the door behind him.
Stay on Ich
watching the door, then --
CUT TO:
KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
On the stage, a young professional looking man is singing
along to "SUMMERTIME" blasting from the stereo.
The
Japanese way of letting it all hang out.
We find Joyce and Nick at a corner table having a drink.
JOYCE
I've heard of Sugai.
I've also
heard of the emperor.
They're both
national treasures.
One's a hood.
NICK
I need someone to translate for me.
JOYCE
My Japanese isn't that hot...
Besides, you'll never get in.
NICK
It's my last shot.
I have to be on
a plane home tomorrow night.
JOYCE
And I'm supposed to care?
NICK
You could fake it.
Joyce finishes her drink, sets it down.
CUT TO:
ICH'S APARTMENT - DAWN
Ich is sleeping.
Nick slips into his leather motorcycle jacket.
He drops
Charlie's gun into his pocket.
He glances down at Ich,
seeing if he's awake.
He's not.
Nick walks out.
Ich opens his eyes.
He's been awake the whole time.
CUT TO:
THE YANAKA CEMETERY - DAY
Ich, wearing a blue suit, is pouring water over a simple
stone with a wooden dipper.
Next, he places incense in a
holder and folds his hands in prayer.
The photo on the stone is of a young man wearing a school
uniform.
Ich's son.
DISSOLVE TO:
A BULLET TRAIN - DAY
It's bull's-eye nose cone scuds across the endless rice
paddies west of Tokyo.
Women in straw hats stand in the
knee deep water pruning the rice by hand.
Old Japan
rubbing shoulders with the new.
TRAIN - DAY
CLOSE ON NICK looking out the window as the countryside
shoots past at 140 mph.
From O.S. several children
chanting:
"Harrow, Harrow."
Nick looks over to see three uniformed school children
thrusting their notebooks and pens at him.
JOYCE
is sitting across from Nick.
JOYCE
They want your autograph.
NICK
Who am I supposed to be?
JOYCE
This little guy thinks you're Robert
Redford... the other one thinks
you're Charles Bronson...
NICK
Tell them I'm not.
She does, but the kids insist.
JOYCE
They'll never go away.
Nick, reluctantly signs.
Joyce takes one of the kid's
notebooks before passing it back.
JOYCE
Mick Jagger?
Joyce smiles, surprised at his choice.
Then, she looks up
shocked to see --
ICH
carrying a gift wrapped package under his arm.
He's
wearing his hat, blue suit and tie.
Ich sits ACROSS the aisle from Nick and Joyce.
He doesn't
say a word.
Faces straight ahead.
Nick looks at Joyce, then back at Ich.
NICK
I'm sorry, Ichiro.
I lost it last
night.
I shouldn't have hit you.
Still nothing from Ich.
NICK
What's in the box?
ICH
(still not facing
him)
For Sugai.
Caviar, French cheese,
ham... If you come to apologize for
interrupting his meeting, Sugai may
feel obligated to see you.
NICK
So I bring some cheese?
JOYCE
Gifts are expected here.
Nick nods, looks back out the window.
He'll never
understand this country.
He looks back to see --
Joyce looking annoyed at him.
Nick gets the message.
NICK
Hey, Ich... Thanks.
I'm glad you're
here.
I mean it.
Ich still won't acknowledge Nick.
A ROOM IN SUGAI'S HOUSE
A vast, austere, traditional room with sliding rice paper
doors and tatami mats on the floor.
Ich and Joyce, drinking tea, are sitting with their feet
beneath them in the traditional manor.
Nick, smoking, is in a semi-sprawl; using his tea cup as
an ashtray.
A LIEUTENANT enters.
He says something and beckons.
They
all rise.
He says something else.
JOYCE
(to Nick)
Just you.
ANOTHER ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE
Nick enters, ducking his head in the low doorway.
the
shoji slides shut behind him.
The furnishings are minimal but elegant.
There's a
butsudan, a tokonoma, and a low, long table in the middle
of the room.
No chairs.
Nick sits on the floor.
A door slides open at the far end of the room.
Sugai,
wearing a kimono over western style suit, walks in.
Nick
stands up to shake his hand.
Sugai ignores it, and sits
in the traditional position:
feet tucked beneath him.
SUGAI
I'll spare you the ritual.
He tosses him a palm sized bundle.
Nick catches it.
Inside, are brand new greenbacks:
hundreds.
NICK
This supposed to impress me?
He sets it down.
SUGAI
Pick it up.
Look at it.
Nick hesitates, then picks it up again.
He runs his
fingers over the face of the bill and snaps the paper.
SUGAI
Seven years work by the finest
engraver.
Mass produced,
sequentially numbered.
The best
there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
NICK
I'm impressed.
But let's use the
short form.
I'm looking for --
SUGAI
-- Kobo... I know.
He killed two of
my partners.
One in New York, one
at the printing plant.
Sugai fills a cup of tea for Nick and hands it to him.
NICK
I don't drink tea.
Sugai hands it to him anyway.
SUGAI
I took Kobo from the street.
I gave
him a home, a future... But my ways
were too slow for him... I served
seven years in prison for my boss
when I was a young man.
Kobo
wouldn't serve seven minutes for his
Oyabun.
(sipping his tea)
He was supposed to take over this
syndicate when I retired.
NICK
I want him.
SUGAI
He'll be dealt with.
Sugai sets a plastic wrapped object on a table before
Nick.
Nick recognizes it from the restaurant massacre in
New York.
CLOSE UP:
Nick's fingers tear at the plastic.
A block of
black iridescent polymer.
The negative image of a $100.00
bill.
A printing plate.
SUGAI
Our associates in New York were
close to closing a deal with us.
NICK
The families who control the
casinos?
SUGAI
Yes.
Unlike our syndicates, your
criminals don't understand the words
'honor' and 'duty'... We can't
afford not to deal with them.
Sugai takes the plate back.
SUGAI
Imagine if your families could pay
their gambling and drug debts with
perfect counterfeit bought for cents
on the dollar.
NICK
The Feds would be onto you in a
month.
SUGAI
Not with these bills.
And even if
it only took them six months, do you
know what our profit margin would
be?
Nick looks at a child playing near one of the hot pools in
Sugai's garden.
NICK
Why tell me this?
SUGAI
The other plate is currently in New
York, in the hands of Kobo's man.
Find it for me.
NICK
You trust me?
SUGAI
I'll pay you.
Nick laughs at Sugai's audaciousness.
NICK
(indicating the
counterfeit bills)
With these?
SUGAI
Swiss bank deposit.
Gold bullion.
Whatever you want.
You know the
city and the police.
NICK
If I say no?
SUGAI
You're smarter than Kobo.
You know
the price of deceit.
Think about
it.
NICK
I don't have to.
Sugai cools.
Without a word he gets to his feet and
starts toward the door.
NICK
I have ten hours to grab my man.
ON SUGAI
still walking with his back to Nick.
NICK (O.S.)
You won't get hurt.
Sugai turns to see Nick, across the room, pointing the
Beretta at his head.
CUT TO:
ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
The room where Ich and Joyce are waiting.
Sugai enters.
Their surprise turns to shock when they see Nick behind
him holding a gun to the old man's head.
ICH
No...
NICK
Let's go.
Him first.
ICH
Nick, you can't do this.
NICK
It's done.
(to Joyce)
You don't have to come.
She hasn't moved a muscle.
INT SUGAI'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE WAY
Sugai watches calmly as Nick, Ich, and Joyce put their
shoes on.
Nick keeps the gun on him.
CUT TO:
HOTEL ROOM
Western style.
Plastic five foot cacti in front of the
western vista on the walls.
A hitching post at the head
of the bed.
Cowboy hats and boots at the other end.
Sugai hangs up the phone and turns to Nick and Joyce who
are sitting nearby.
Ich hangs up the extension.
SUGAI
Kobo will meet me here tomorrow.
Ten a.m.
Ich nods, confirming that what Sugai says is true.
NICK
Good.
SUGAI
He'll find out you took me.
I'm
unprotected.
He'll kill us.
All of
us.
You don't stand a chance.
Ich, knowing Sugai is right, looks at Nick.
Nick flips
Ich the gun.
NICK
Not if we're careful.
Ich checks to make sure the gun is loaded, then watches as
Nick escorts Joyce out of the room.
CUT TO:
A HOTEL ROOM ACROSS THE HALL
Fifties theme.
The front end of a pink chevy curves
around the bed.
A "Drive-In" movie screen along one wall.
Nick is dropping change into the vintage Wurlitzer.
Joyce
steps in, leaving the door open.
JOYCE
You're out of your mind.
I'm
leaving.
Nick doesn't respond.
JOYCE
You'll get Ich killed.
NICK
No one's keeping him here.
JOYCE
Bullshit, Nick.
And don't tell me
this is all just about Charlie.
It's not.
NICK
Why would you care?
That pushes her over the line.
JOYCE
Bastard...
She moves toward him, enraged.
Nick grabs her arm.
JOYCE
Let go.
He won't.
JOYCE
You're out of your mind.
He grips her tighter.
CUT TO:
THE ROOM - LATER
Nick and Joyce, only partially undressed, are making love
on the floor.
The Drifters singing "Under The Boardwalk"
can be heard on the Wurlitzer.
The fifties decor, the
music, it's all pretty incongruous.
CUT TO:
SUGAI'S ROOM
Sugai, wearing his hat, is slumped down on the couch which
has been splintered by the bullets from below.
OUTSIDE THE ROOM
Kobo signals the men.
All six open-up through the door.
INSIDE THE ROOM
The door, what's left of it, is kicked open.
The six men
step in, shooting in all directions:
into the bathroom
door, into the closet... Windows shatter, mirrors fall,
total destruction.
They stop.
SILENCE.
Kobo walks up to Sugai who is slumped on the couch.
He
lifts up his hat.
It's a cowboy mannequin wearing Sugai's
clothes.
THE ELEVATOR DOOR
opens.
A DOZEN of Sugai's men carrying machine pistols
come out.
THE OUTSIDE BALCONY
Nick and Ich lie on their bellies, guns out.
INSIDE THE ROOM
Kobo's men turn.
Sugai's men open-up.
Three of Kobo's
hitters go down.
The others try to flee into the
adjoining room.
Kobo goes for the balcony.
THE BALCONY
as Kobo steps out.
He steps right into --
NICK
who slams the side of Kobo's head with the butt of his
gun.
THE ROOM
Nick and Ich drag Kobo in by his jacket collar.
Sugai,
very much alive, walks in from the hallway.
Nothing is
said.
Sugai looks at Kobo for a long beat, then walks
out.
CUT TO:
SUGAI'S HOUSE - DAY
KOBO
standing alone in the middle of a tatami room.
His face
is badly beaten.
His hands are bound.
Two guards stand
near the wall.
Nick and Ich stand across the room.
SUGAI
wearing a western suit, is asking Kobo questions in
Japanese.
Sugai barks at him again.
Kobo refuses to
answer.
Sugai pulls up a shuto -- an 18 inch knife --
from it's scabbard.
SUGAI
(in Japanese)
Contact your associate in New York
and tell him to hand my plate over
to Abolofia.
Nothing from Kobo.
SUGAI
You have betrayed the syndicate and
personally dishonored me.
I would
rather the deal fell through than...
The guards walk over and turn Kobo around.
His back is to
Sugai.
Sugai runs the sword across the nape of Kobo's
neck drawing blood.
The guards tighten their grip on
Kobo's arms.
NICK
can't believe Sugai's going to kill him.
Nick starts to
get up, Ich stops him.
Kobo realizes Sugai isn't just threatening him.
KOBO
No... I'll arrange it.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE ROOM - LATER
Kobo is led back into the room by two guards.
The guards
shove him down to the floor.
His hands are still bound.
Nick walks over and stands above him.
He doesn't say a
word.
Just stands above him.
Then, Nick pulls spare
change from his pocket and slowly drops the coins, one by
one, in front of Kobo's face, like Kobo did to him.
He
walks away.
Sugai steps in.
SUGAI
Abolofia's person has received the
plate.
It's done.
A door opens at the far end of the room.
It's Kobo's
girlfriend, the one Nick and Ich had been following.
She starts toward Kobo; a lieutenant intercepts her.
SUGAI
(in Japanese)
I wanted you to see him like this.
GIRL
(in Japanese)
Let him go, father.
ON ICH
realizing she's Sugai's daughter.
GIRL
(in Japanese)
You're too old...
SUGAI
(in Japanese)
That's enough.
Sugai turns away and picks up the sword.
The guards
clutch Kobo.
Sugai's going to kill Kobo after all.
The girl screams at him to stop.
Sugai's oblivious.
NICK (O.S.)
That wasn't our deal.
SUGAI
You want him dead too.
NICK
After a court convicts him.
He
belongs to me.
There's a long pause.
Then, something unusual happens.
Sugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten Kobo's wrist.
When
he does, Sugai hands Kobo the sword and demands that he
cut off his finger.
This is Yubitsume:
the ritual act within the Yakuza of
slicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a
mistake.
Kobo, not believing in this ancient tradition, refuses.
Sugai nods to a guard who places Kobo's finger on the
table.
KOBO
stares defiantly at Sugai.
He doesn't even wince as the
blade slices off his finger.
The guard hands Sugai the
finger in a handkerchief.
SUGAI
(looking at Nick)
If anything happens to Abolofia or
my plate, detective...
HOLD on Nick then --
CUT TO:
TRAIN - DAY
Kobo is sitting by the window, his hands cuffed in front
of him.
Another pair of cuffs chain him to the arm rest.
Nick pours a drink from an airline-sized bottle of Scotch.
He holds it out to... Ich.
It's his first drink in a
week.
NICK
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
ICH
Kampai.
They clink glasses.
Ich drinks it down.
NICK
It took 12 years to make it, you
could take five minutes to drink it.
Ich slows down.
NICK
You did great, Ichiro.
ICH
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.
(smiling)
I like him waiting.
Ich gets up.
ICH
Needs ice.
He heads for the bar car, leaving Kobo and Nick alone.
Kobo looks out the window at the people working the rice
paddies, then back down the aisle at the Salarymen in
their identical suits, then at the women separated from
them.
KOBO
Ugly... A couple of thousand years
they've been bound by these little
rules.
Looking in.
Always afraid.
Ugly little lives...
NICK
Save it, I already took the tour.
KOBO
You are a lucky man.
Where you come
from a man can stand out.
It's
expected.
Here a man is made to
look a fool for standing out.
Nick isn't paying much attention.
KOBO
I like your friend, Joyce.
You're
lucky.
NICK
Guess I'm on a roll.
KOBO
She's such a long way home for you.
NICK
Time, I've got plenty of.
A raucous SALARYMAN comes down the aisle, singing an Enka,
swaying with the train, bumping into seats.
A common
enough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers.
The Salaryman stumbles and falls across Nick's lap.
NICK
(helping him up)
Hey, hey, come on, blow...
The Salaryman bows deep.
Nick ignores it.
The man moves
on.
Kobo looks out the window, the train begins to SLOW
as it approaches the next station.
KOBO
(matter-of-factly)
This is my stop.
NICK
I'm amused.
KOBO
Don't be.
Nick looks up to see Kobo calmly fingering a lock of blond
hair tied with black ribbon.
Joyce's ribbon.
Joyce's
hair.
KOBO
I have her.
Nick looks down the car.
The drunk Salaryman who stumbled
over Nick is quite sober.
He made the hand-off to Kobo.
Kobo holds out his wrists.
Nick hesitates.
KOBO
(matter-of-factly)
I'll kill her.
Nick, reluctantly, unlocks both sets of cuffs.
The train
pulls into the station.
KOBO
I want the plate from your pal,
Sugai.
When you get it, you get
her.
Kobo gets up, starts down the aisle.
NICK
Sugai won't give it to me, you know
that.
KOBO
Then take it from him.
Kobo gets off the train.
NICK
follows him to the door.
THE STATION
Kobo get into a waiting Jaguar.
Four guards nearby.
INSIDE THE TRAIN
Nick runs down the length of the car trying to keep the
Jaguar in sight as the train pulls out... the car is gone.
NICK
bursts into the packed bar car.
NICK
Ichiro?!
Everyone turns around.
No Ich.
CUT TO:
TRAIN
Nick shoves past the passengers lined up in the vestibule,
ignoring a conductor's angry shouts.
TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER
The train stops.
Nick flies out and starts running,
dodging the crowd.
Three uniformed policemen, including Ohashi's assistant,
hurry toward him; they're dismayed to find that Kobo is
gone.
NICK
Where's Ohashi?
Instead of offering him help, the policemen grab him and
slap a pair of handcuffs on Nick's wrists.
NICK
What the hell are you doing?!
CUT TO:
HOLDING CELL - TOKYO POLICE STATION
Nick, waiting alone in the cell.
It's been hours.
A door
at the end of the hall opens.
Ohashi stops in front of his cell.
OHASHI
Your plane leaves at six.
Two
officers will escort you.
NICK
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your
help.
Let me out of here!
OHASHI
You had my help, detective.
NICK
If anything happens to her while I'm
here --
OHASHI
-- Do you know where she is,
detective?
Do you know how to find
her?
Even where to start?
We will
find them.
NICK
I have to get to Sugai.
OHASHI
Goodbye, officer.
Ohashi keeps walking.
NICK
OHASHI!
The LOUD clank of metal on metal.
Ohashi's gone.
NICK
(yelling at the top
of his lungs)
OHASHI!!
HOLD on Nick, his fingers squeezing the bars in rage,
then --
CUT TO:
SUGAI'S HOUSE - AT THAT MOMENT
Kobo's girl, Sugai's daughter, hangs up the phone.
She's
been on the other end of the line.
SUGAI'S ROOM
The door swings open.
Sugai is sitting on the floor.
The
girl is carrying a tray of tea.
Beneath the tray, we spot
something else -- the butt of a short-bladed tanto.
CUT TO:
HOLDING ROOM - NARITA AIRPORT
A white room.
No chairs.
Jet engines can be HEARD
through the walls.
Nick is sitting on the floor,
defeated.
He doesn't look up when he hears someone enter.
ICH (O.S.)
I'll tell you one thing.
You can't
solve a thing sitting on your ass.
Nick looks up.
Ich is in uniform.
A revolver and batton
hang from his white web gear.
His undershirt bulges
through his khaki shirt.
He looks ridiculous.
Nick has
never seen a more beautiful sight.
CUT TO:
POLICE CAR
Ich is driving.
Nick is seated behind a cage in the back
seat.
His hands are cuffed.
Ich is driving through the
freight area towards a perimeter guard.
NICK
I was ready to have your ass for
taking off on me.
ICH
I followed them.
An hour from the
train station.
NICK
How many men?
ICH
I couldn't tell.
NICK
Joyce?
ICH
I don't know.
NICK
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Ich nods.
HOUSE
KOBO AND SUGAI'S DAUGHTER
are putting the last of their belongings into a suitcase.
She hands him the plate -- Sugai's plate.
Kobo kisses her as he slips it into his breast pocket.
The SOUND of a motorcycle approaching from outside.
TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Fifty identical desks.
Fifty identically dressed men in
white shirts and ties work under fluorescent lights.
OHASHI
is at his desk studying a report.
Suddenly, the lights go out.
The fan's stop, so do the
electric typewriters.
Ohashi looks up to see --
ICH
walking toward him down the long aisle, his left arm is
bandaged, his right hand handcuffed to Kobo on crutches.
Ich silently leads the captured man down the long aisle to
Ohashi's desk.
ICH
stops in front of the desk and snaps to attention.
ICH
Constable Ichiro Matsumoto presents
captured prisoner Kobo, Chief
Inspector Ohashi.
Ich salutes.
OHASHI
Inspector Ohashi will take charge of
the prisoner.
Ich uncuffs Kobo and steps aside to reveal --
NICK
standing at the far end of the room by the fuse box.
He's
also bandaged and on crutches.
Nick looks at Ohashi without saying a word, then flips the
main switch up.
The lights and fans start working.
He turns and walks out the door.
CUT TO:
JAPANESE RESTAURANT - TOKYO - DAY
Joyce and Nick are sitting alone at a table.
Nick's left
arm in in a sling.
NICK
Can't make you change your mind?
JOYCE
Last time you asked me to come along
I nearly got a hole in my head.
NICK
Might be different in New York.
JOYCE
Maybe.
If I come visit, we can find
out.
NICK
I'd like that.
Ich sits down with two fresh bowls of soba noodles.
Nick
hesitates.
ICH
You can do it.
Nick picks up his chopsticks with his good hand.
He
begins to slurp the noodles.
ICH
Louder, pal, louder.
NICK
Joyce, give the assistant Chief
Inspector a drink, would you?
As Joyce refills all their cups we...
SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:
POLICE STATION
Capt. Oliver is standing by the window watching the rain
pour down.
OLIVER
... Remember, counterfeiting is the
Feds.
They'll be all over
Abolofia's place.
Stick tight.
You I.D. the other plate, he does
real time.
NICK
Right.
Reveal Nick sitting in front of Oliver's desk, his one arm
is still in a sling.
Nick gets to his feet.
OLIVER
(still not facing
him)
You know, Nick, if you'd held on to
that plate, you could've been a very
rich man.
Oliver turns to face Nick.
Nick just looks at him, then:
NICK
Never crossed my mind.
Oliver nods; he believes him.
OLIVER
Be careful on the run.
CUT TO:
SQUAD BAY - NIGHT
In contrast to the Japanese police station -- it's chaos.
Cops are in every imaginable kind of dress, trash cans
over flow, a handcuffed prisoner screams abuse to anyone
who will listen.
THE RAIDING PARTY
a dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and
windbreakers with POLICE and TREASURY stenciled on the
back.
NICK
walks in with two heavy bullet proof vests slung over his
shoulder.
He squeezes past the raiding party to find
ICH
sitting at a desk, thumbing through a Frommer's guide to
New York City.
Nick drops one of the vests on the desk.
It lands like a ton of bricks.
Ich continues to read.
A Sergeant walks in.
SERGEANT
Saddle up.
Hard team in the first
unit.
Conklin, your RMP awaits.
The cops and treasury men, grabbing their gear, head for
the door.
Nick is struggling to get into his vest using one arm.
NICK
Sure you want to come?
Probably
better than the Greyline Tour.
Ich stands up, shoves the guidebook in his back pocket.
He helps Nick fasten the strap in back.
ICH
You wouldn't make it without me.
Nick smiles, takes the Frommer's out of Ich's pocket and
tosses it into the trash.
Nick hands him a shotgun, takes another one off the rack
for himself.
We watch from behind as the two men head down the long
hallway toward the exit.
ICH
Think we'll get him, Nick?
NICK
We can't lose.
ICH
How can you be so sure?
Nick opens the door at the far end of the hallway.
They
step out into the sunlit rain.
NICK
Cause you're the biggest thing to
hit this town since...
Before Nick can finish his line, the door SLAMS SHUT
behind them.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END
