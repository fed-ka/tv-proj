Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he
looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The
twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD
BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly
shows them to a shitty table.
HARRY (V.O.)
There you have it. The story in a
nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I?
(Harry TRIPS, his wife
looks disgusted)
Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at
me. I look like I'm about to die. God
help me. I do not want to die.
SMASH CUT TO:
3.
A LONG STRETCH OF PRISTINE COUNTRY ROAD - THE HAMPTONS - DAY
A Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry's
behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next
to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An "IT" Girl. Smart,
sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art.
Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year
age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS
along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD.
MARIN
( singing)
To all my thugs that be livin' it
up, we say, what I do. To all my...
(stops)
Oh! This is it. Make a right.
HARRY
(admiring the
neighborhood)
So baby, you're rich... .
MARIN
Well, my mother is, sort of. Not
really...
HARRY
If she lives within a mile of here, she's
rich.
MARIN
I guess a hit play will buy you a house
in The Hamptons.
HARRY
I'd like to meet your mother.
MARIN
No you wouldn't. I mean, she's
great. She's totally brilliant, but
she's not your type.
HARRY
You're overlooking one of the great
things about me. I don't have a type.
MARIN
(very directly)
She's over thirty.
Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt.
MARIN
Oh, what?! Like you don't know you
have a slight reputation for...
4.
Just then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin.
HARRY
-- For what?
Harry waits. RINGGG!
He doesn't look away.
MARIN
For never dating anyone over 30.
Don't look at me like that.
HARRY
It's just not true.
MARIN
Okay. Sorry. Over 31?
HARRY
Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The
Hamptons to let me know you're a wise
ass.
(answers phone)
Hold on. . .
(then to Marin)
It just so happens, my dear, that women
of a certain age, don't date me. You ever
think of it that way? No, it's always me.
You dames are all alike.
(then into phone)
Hey...
MARIN
(amused, to herself)
Dames...
Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry
confidently slips his hand onto her thigh.
BARRY
(into phone)
Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who
else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't
find me. Who?
(glances at Marin, she's
not listening)
I'll call her later. No, I have it.
Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if'
she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that
card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've
reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass
and the ocean stretch before them.
5.
MARIN
(all business)
Make a right, left at the second
fence.
Marin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just
came over her, looks out the window.
HARRY
Have I mentioned how gorgeous your
breasts look in this sweater?
MARIN
(blushing)
Yes you have actually.
HARRY
So it would be too much to mention it
again. . .
Marin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway,
driving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE.
HARRY
Wow. It's the perfect beach house.
MARIN
I know. My mother doesn't know how
to do things that aren't perfect.
HARRY
Which explains you.
That got her. Harry parks. She looks over at him but he's
grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at
her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say
such a lovely thought.
MARIN
(trying to keep up with
him)
Yeah, okay, right...
They both grab their H
overnight bags and step out of the car.
ARRY
So, what are we gonna do out here,
just the two of us, for two whole
days?
Marin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms
around his neck.
MARIN
Tell me the truth, are you at all
glad we waited?
6.
HARRY
I'm incredibly glad we're finally
going to do it.
(she's a bit disappointed)
If that's the same as being glad we
waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic.
Marin smiles then kisses him. He's one of those guys that
lets you kiss them.
HARRY
(slaps her tush)
Let's go for a swim, how long will
it take you to change?
MARIN
Two minutes.
Marin starts UNBUTTONING HER SWEATER as she dances
seductively toward the front door, then notices Harry's
cigars.
MARIN
Oh Har... No smoking in the house. My
Mom doesn't allow it.
HARRY
But she allows you to strip in the
front yard and bring men you're
dating here to...
MARIN
She doesn't know everything I do...Or
when I do it.. or where I do it.
She SLIPS OFF her sweater and DROPS IT ON HARRY'S HEAD.
It's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm
with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around
the rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight
pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to
undress.
MARIN
(TAKING OFF her belt)
The fabulous living room, perfect for
entertaining an intimate group of friends
or that special someone.
(DROPS her belt then
UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt)
Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck
complete with pool and ocean view.
7.
MARIN (CONT'D)
(UNBUCKLES Harry's belt)
Your pants, please...
HARRY
Ladies first.
Marin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of
them. She's now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES.
MARIN
Gourmet kitchen's to your left
where tonight I will whip you up a
culinary feast of Mac and Cheese.
Marin HEARS Harry's ZIPPER UNZIP. She turns, her EYES
WIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down
to his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile.
MARIN
(smiling)
.. O-kay, going quickly now...
Master bedroom is that away...
They arrive in a warmly decorated GUEST BEDROOM.
M
ARIN
And this as they say on 'Cribs',
your favorite show, is where the
magic happens. Do we like it? Going
once, going twice ...
HARRY
Sold.
Harry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO
THE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her
ass.
MARIN
You know when I first started
auctioneering someone told me if I was
nervous to just picture everyone in the
audience in their underwear. This sort of
gives that a whole new meaning.
HARRY
Why? You're not nervous now, are you?
MARIN
I'm always a little nervous.
HARRY
(removing his hands)
So put on your bathing suit. I brought
some champagne, I'll put it on ice.
8.
MARIN
Me like you, Harry Langer.
She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the
bathroom.
Harry lies there alone for a second. Catches his breath. He
sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his
throat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a
stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that
young man.
Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the
Living ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into
his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in
the mirror, sucks in his gut.
Well stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the
fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS
and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively
conversation.
One of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's
Younger Sister, ZOE.
ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old.
It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not
because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and
right. Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond
expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of
herself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she
just is.
Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She
wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, "BOYS LIE".
The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR
IS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking
E
out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.
RICA
Oh God. What is this?
Erica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife.
Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.
ERICA
(in control)
Okay, stay right where you are. We have a
knife.
9.
HARRY
(eyeing the knife)
Do you... live here?
ERICA
Okay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial
911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe,
hand me the phone.
(reaches out to Zoe
without looking at her)
HARRY
You don't understand. I'm a friend
of your daughter's.
With that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's
naked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe
FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly..
ERICA
Yeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in
the city and you what, wandered in
here,like high on Ecstasy..?.
(looks at phone)
Shit. I dialed 8-1-1.
(redials)
HARRY
(calmly starts to move)
Honestly, if you just...
ERICA
Back off. She was in the Israeli
army. She can break you in half.
Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it
whatsoever.
ERICA
(into phone)
Yes. I have an intruder in my
house. 29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack.
HARRY
I'm dating your daughter Marin. She
invited me here for the weekend.
She's in her room right now,
changing.
ERICA
(GASPS even louder, really
scared now)
You're dating my daughter?
10.
HARRY
(amused)
Now who would've thought that would
be worse news?
With that, Marin ENTERS, in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his
shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the
phone.
MARIN
Oh, fuck.
ERICA
Oh, God.
(into phone)
I'm sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no, I'm
sure. No, he's not a burglar
(with enormous difficulty)
He's dating my daughter.
MARIN
Mom, I had no idea you were coming out
this weekend, you said you had to write.
ERICA
I do. I thought I'd do it out here.
MARIN
Oh, man, this is really....
ERICA
Awkward.
MARIN
Totally.. .but....
(starts laughing)
You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought
he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts?
ERICA
Yeah, well, the world's nuts, I
don't know the man. . .
MARIN
(still laughing)
I'm sorry, it's not really funny.
I'm an idiot. I should've told you
I was bringing someone out.
E
RICA
No, no, I should've told you we
were coming. Well. Anyway, here we
are.
(waves to Harry)
Hello. I'm the mother.
11.
All three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster
shaped oven mitt over his "privates"...
HARRY
Harry Langer. How are ya?
MARIN
Yes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend,
Harry. Harry, my Mom, Erica... my Aunt,
Zoe.
(they all shake hands)
Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I
mentioned him in an e-mail. We just,
totally spur of the moment thought we'd
get out of the city for a few days.
ERICA AND ZOE
Of course...Right...Great...
ERICA
(can't look at him)
Honey, does Harry have a robe?
HARRY
(backing out)
You know what? Actually, I think I should
just take off. Let you gals enjoy your
weekend...
Marin shoots her Mom a look. Help!
ERICA
No, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look,
here's what we'll do. Zoe and I will
leave. We took a great walk on the beach,
we'll go into town for lunch. You two
stay. Harry, apologize about the near
arrest.
HARRY
No, you were impressive. Very strong,
very... "macho".
ERICA
(a little thrown)
I don't think I was exactly "macho"
...
HARRY
Trust me, if I ever catch a guy in
his underwear in my refrigerator I
hope I'm half the man you were, Mrs
uh...
12.
ERICA
(already hating him)
Yeah. Okay. Whatever...
Marin watches. Dying.
HARRY
All righty then...I'm definitely gonna
hit the road.
(salutes Erica and Zoe)
Ladies...sensational meeting you.
(then to Marin)
Doll, call me.
ZOE
Hold on. Hold on. Let's not get so
dramatic here. What are we four
teenagers? We're all sophisticated
people. Why can't we all stay, for the
weekend? Your mother's got work to do
I've got papers to grade. You'll do your
thing, whatever that is and if we want to
hang together, we'll hang together. If we
don't, we don't. There's no reason why
any of us should give up this spectacular
weekend.
MARIN
Seriously. I can handle it.
ZOE
I can totally handle it.
ERICA
(on the spot)
I mean, well, I can "handle" it...
The Women all look to Harry. He looks at Marin. She's hard to
resist.
HARRY
It can only go up from here.
CUT TO:
HARRY AND MARIN
Walking past SHOPS on the MAIN DRAG IN EAST HAMPTON. They are
both licking ice cream cones. CAMERA STAYS BEHIND THEM.
Z
OE (V.O.)
He's obviously a penis substitute.
13.
ERICA AND ZOE
Are paced 20 feet behind them, carrying groceries.
ZOE
I mean a father substitute.
ERICA
Except he's older than her father. I
can't even look at them. What is she
doing with a guy that age?
ZOE
Marin was how old when you guys broke up?
ERICA
Five years ago, so. ..twenty-three.
ZOE
Okay, so she was old enough not to
feel Dave was walking out on her.
ERICA
Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out
on me? Why do people assume when you
break up after twenty years that the
guy's the one who wanted out? Just
because once we broke up he shtupped
everything that moved...
ZOE
Easy cowgirl. I didn't mean it that way.
Just trying to figure out why such a
smart girl is always with the wrong guy.
CLOSE ON A YOUNG FRENCH GIRL IN AN APRON
YOUNG FRENCH GIRL
Mme. Barry, que je puis vous obtenir
aujourd'hui?
The Girl stands BEHIND THE CHEESE COUNTER in:
THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA
A Gourmet Market in East Hampton. The clientele in here is as
rich looking as the food. Erica stands on the other side of
the Cheese Counter.
ERICA
Bonjour je veux une partie de votre
pate merveilleux et de votre
meilleur fromage absolu de chevre.
14.
Harry and Marin shop near by. Harry listens to Erica out of
one ear.
HARRY
That's impressive.
MARIN
She started French lessons after she and
my Dad split up. Part of her "Keep Busy,
Don't Look Back" program. She's
practically fluent now.
ERICA
(turning back to Marin)
Marin, au cas ou nous prende un desset ou
devrions jefaire quelgue chose?
MARIN
(with an impeccable
accent)
Laissons quelque chose d'achat. Et
ce grand gateau de chocolat?
HARRY
Hey, not bad.. .
MARIN
(shrugs)
Yeah...well. ..I am fluent. Be right
back.
Marin crosses to the dessert counter. Erica turns back and
catches Harry checking out Marin's ass. He smiles as he licks
his ice cream. Erica rolls her eyes then spots another Older
Guy with a Leggy Girl twenty-five years his junior.
ERICA
It's an epidemic.
Then Erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter.
She sees her Sister, Zoe, reading a cheese label with her
glasses on and next to Zoe are two sad looking Old Women in
their Eighties with their arms linked. Almost woozy, Erica is
snapped out of it when she is handed her package.
Y
OUNG FRENCH GIRL
Merci madame.
Erica heads down the aisle, passing Harry whose back is to
her. Just as she passes, he turns and almost bumps into her.
ERICA
(backing off)
Woops. Sorry.
15.
HARRY
My fault.
They so very badly do not want to actually touch. Erica
hesitates. Harry gestures for her to go first then walks
alongside her.
ERICA
So, Harry... What do you do?
HARRY
I'm one of the owners of a record
company among other things...
ERICA
Oh, really? Which record company?
HARRY
Drive by Records.
ERICA
(appalled at the name)
"Drive By" Records??? Is that a
joke? What is that?
HARRY
It's a Hip Hop label.
ERICA
Hip Hop? Oh, rap? Oh, right. Well.
(with disdain)
Okay. That's... "interesting"...
HARRY
Let me see if I get where you're
headed here. . .
ERICA
I'm sorry, but, look, you know I hate
rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent
and crude for my taste, not to mention
just a tad misogynistic.
HARRY
Hey, a lot of people see rapping as
poetry.
ERICA
Yeah, but come on, how many words
can you rhyme with 'Bitch'?
Erica places her groceries on the check out counter.
MARIN
(joining Harry)
How we doin?
16.
HARRY
Should've left when she tried to arrest
me.
Marin serves plates of pasta with lobster. Zoe pours wine and
Erica tosses a salad. Harry is the only one sitting.
MARIN
So, Mom, how's the new play? You gettin'
happy with it?
Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger
along "the nape of his neck. They smile at each other as she
continues on. Erica notices, tries not to respond.
ERICA
Well, the thing with me is that I'm about
90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the
talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet.
ZOE
Yeah, right...
HARRY
What's your play about?
Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica.
She's hesitant to reveal this.
ERICA
About? Well, I'm not exactly sure which
is a bit of a problem, but so far it's
about a divorced woman, a writer, she's
this high strung, over-amped,
controlling, know it all neurotic. . .
(everyone stares at her)
Who's incredibly cute and lovable.
(more stares)
It's a comedy.
(takes a seat next to Zoe)
M
So, how did you two meet?
ARIN
At a Wine Auction at Sotheby's. Harry was
the big buyer of the night.
HARRY
I kept winking at Marin as she was
conducting the auction and apparently
every time I did that she misunderstood
and I ended up buying cases of
outrageously expensive wine.
17.
Zoe and Marin laugh.
ERICA
Ever been married, Harry?
HARRY
No. No, I haven't.
ERICA
Wow. Now why do you think that is?
HARRY
Some people just don't fit the mold. And
so far...
ERICA
Hey, if it ain't broke.
HARRY
Exactly.
Harry leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair. Erica
takes note.
ZOE
Wait a second, aren't you like a famous
bachelor?
HARRY
I wouldn't say I'm famous.
ZOE
No, I think I read a piece on you
in New York Magazine.
HARRY
I guess people find it interesting
that I've escaped the noose for so
long.
ZOE
Yeah, wasn't the name of the article,
"The Escape Artist"?
ERICA
Wait. I read that article. That was you?
You were once engaged to somebody big.
Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait.
..Carly Simon?
ZOE
Yeah, it was somebody cool like that.
(trying to remember)
Not Martha Stewart....
18.
MARIN
You could just ..'ask him.
HARRY
No, this is more fun. It's like I'm
not here.
MARIN
Harry was once engaged to Diane
Sawyer. Okay?
ZOE
Right. Diane Sawyer. I love her.
ERICA
(stunned)
I'm impressed.
HARRY
Yeah, women your age love that
about me.
Erica pauses on that one.
HARRY
(trying to get thru this)
You know what I mean.
ERICA
Yes I do.
HARRY
It's not a bad thing to say 'women
your age'.
ERICA
No...I'm sure it was a compliment.
HARRY
It was. ..just the truth.
ZOE
(stepping in)
So when was this engagement?
HARRY
Long time ago. She was just this
adorable lanky girl from Kentucky
with the greatest pair of legs I'd
ever seen... Never understood her
ending up with a job where she
never showed them.
(munches on his lobster)
19.
ERICA
You're not serious? She's Diane
Sawyer, she goes into caves in
Afghanistan with a shmahtah on her
head. Who cares about her legs?
HARRY
Just anyone who's ever had the
pleasure of... You know what? I
hate to eat and run but...
ZOE
No, wait. This is actually a very
fascinating dynamic - what's going
on at this table...
MARIN
(warning him)
Z
oe teaches Women's Studies at
Columbia. . .
HARRY
Oh, so this is gonna hurt.
ZOE
No, come on, listen, here's the rub
for women. Look at what we have
here with you and Erica. Harry,
you've been around the block a few
times, right? You're what? Around
60, never been married, which, we
all know, if you were a woman,
would be a curse, you'd be an old
maid, a spinster, blah, blah,
blah... Okay, so instead of pitying
you, they write articles about you,
celebrate your never marrying, it
makes you illusive and ungettable.
You're a real catch. Then, take my
gorgeous sister here...
ERICA
Any chance of you stopping here?
ZOE
Come on, this is interesting. I
mean, look at her, she's so
accomplished, the most successful
woman playwright since who? Lillian
Hellman? She's over fifty,
divorced and still sits in night
after night because the available
guys her age want
(to Marin)
20.
ZOE(cont'd)
--forgive me honey for saying this,
but they want girls that look like
Marin so the whole over fifty
dating scene is geared completely
towards men leaving older women out
and as a result that makes the
older women more and more
productive and more and more
interesting, which, in turn, makes
them even less desirable because as
we all know -- men, especially
older men, are threatened and
deathly afraid of interesting and
accomplished women. It's just so
clear. Single older women, as a
demographic, are as fucked a group
as can ever exist.
Erica and Harry's EYES CONNECT for a millisecond. HEAR THE
SOUND OF PLATES CRASHING.
OVER, we
Erica is cleaning up the broken plates, Zoe leans down to
help.
ERICA
What are you, possessed? How could
you say those things?
ZOE
It just seemed so obvious to me. The
injustice of it. Thank God men die
younger than us. It's the only break we
get.
ERICA
Then you know what? Write a dissertation
on it, don't announce to the world that I
stay in night after night after night and
by the way, one night after night would
have been enough. Did you ever realize, I
stay "in" as part of my job. Why do you
think I married the director of my plays?
He was the only man I ever saw. Anyway, I
like staying in and I like this time in
my life. Why do I have to defend myself?
M
I was married for 20 years. I'm done.
arin ENTERS carrying more dishes.
MARIN
What the hell was that?
21.
ZOE
I'm sorry, I thought I was onto
something.
ERICA
Honey, what are you doing with this
guy? He's old, he's chauvinistic...
MARIN
He's fun.
ERICA
He's fun? How is he fun? He's
like.. .wrong.
MARIN
Wrong can be fun, Mom.
ERICA
Not this wrong.
MARIN
Can we not do this now? He's
actually incredibly smart and
fascinating and if you had talked
to him about something other than
his marital status you would've
found out how smart he is. He owns
like 10 different companies...
ERICA
What does that mean he owns ten
different companies? He can't
commit, that's what that means. Not
that, God forbid, I want him to
commit.
MARIN
Yeah, that I get. Anyway, he said he
thought you two were very spontaneous and
nice and then said he's leaving as soon
as the sun comes up.
ERICA
What? His car doesn't have
headlights?
MARIN
Good night.
ERICA
Wait. I have no right to get this
nuts.
(hugs her)
He's your friend. Not mine. I love
you.
22.
MARIN
(hugs her back)
I love you more.
This is obviously a ritual between them. Erica kisses
Marin's cheek in a flutter of kisses, then Marin
EXITS.
ZOE
No chance he said we were nice.
ERICA
Please. None.
They HEAR MUSIC coming from Marin's bedroom.
ZOE
What are they listening to?
ERICA
I don't care...
(listens)
Oy. Marvin Gaye. . .
Erica turns on the garbage disposal. Zoe sings along,
"Let's get it on". .., Erica shoots her a look, turns
off the garbage disposal, doing the dishes with vigor.
ERICA
I know she'll never see him after
this weekend. She can't commit
either.
Then they hear Marin GIGGLING.
ZOE
He does sound fun.
Marin YELPS.
ZOE
Admit it, he's got something. You
felt it, right?
Then they hear Marin SCREAM.
ERICA
Oh, this is nuts...
Erica covers her ears with her hands. Then they hear
Marin SCREAM "MOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!"
ERICA
Did she say, Mom?
23.
Erica and Zoe bust into the room and find Harry .on the
floor, leaning against the bed, a clenched fist on his chest.
His shirt is open, he's sweating, his complexion is grey.
Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near him.
MARIN
We were fooling around and he said he
felt funny Hthen he just collapsed.
ARRY
(out of breath)
It's nothing. I'm okay maybe it was
the lobster...
ERICA
Does your chest hurt?
HARRY
Like an elephant's standing on it.
ERICA
(to Marin)
Call 911...tell them to send an
ambulance. . .
Marin hesitates.
ERICA
Marin! Now!
HARRY'S POV - THE ROOM
Spinning. When he shuts his eyes, it goes BLACK. Spinning.
BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. He sees Marin, soft in the
background, on the phone and Erica coming toward him. He
hears Zoe:
ZOE(O.S.)
What are you doing?
ERICA
(coming closer)
Mouth to mouth...
ON HARRY
Even in this state he gets that Erica is about to place her.
mouth on his. His eyes WIDEN IN HORROR, he reels back. Erica
catches this.
ERICA
You fucking guy...
24.
She does it anyway. Her-mouth on his, her breath into his
lungs, over and over. Harry's eyes roll back in hi-so head.
As. Erica pounds on his chest, we HEAR THE BLARE OF A
SIREN...
AND A LOUD CLANG
As the DOORS to SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL FLY OPEN. Paramedics
WHEEL Harry through the corridors and into the ER with
dizzying speed. Two Nurses jostle Harry OFF the gurney and
ONTO A BED.
DR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry's side. Julian is in his
early-thirties and has finally just graduated out of the 'you
look too young to be a doctor' syndrome. Julian is a man
whose goodness makes him sexy. He wears his hair shaggier
than you'd expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins
graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights.
The Nurses place oxygen in Harry's nose, .;hook him up to a
heart monitor and connect him to an IV.
JULIAN
How we doing here?
PARAMEDIC #1
He's had 30 minutes of chest pain,
nausea, shortness of breath, blood
pressure's 170 over 100, pulse 104,
respirations 18...
JULIAN
Let's get an EKG. Mr. Langer, I'm
Dr. Mercer. Are you in any pain
right now?
The Nurse wheels over an EKG machine, Julian helps hook it
up.
HARRY
Feel some pressure in my
chest...it's real tight.
JULIAN
Can you show me where the pain is?
Harry clenches his fist over his sternum.
JULIAN
What were you doing at the onset of
the pain?
HARRY
I was uh, kissing a beautiful...
25.
JULIAN
(watching the monitor)
Where you having intercourse?
HARRY
-- Unfortunately, no.
JULIAN
S
ense of humor in tact...
(checks EKG)
Hang a nitroglycerine drip. Mr.
Langer the EKG shows you have a
blocked artery which is not
allowing enough oxygen to get to
the heart muscle.. .
HARRY
I'm having a heart attack?
JULIAN
We're gonna stop it. But I need to
know what kind of medications you
take?
HARRY
(scared shitless)
I take uh... uh. . . Lipitor. . .
JULIAN
(reading the EKG tape)
Uh-huh... .Any thing else?
HARRY
-- and a white one for blood
pressure. . .
JULIAN
procardia?
HARRY
Yeah.
JULIAN
What about, Viagra?
Erica, Marin and Zoe ARRIVE in the DOORWAY of the ER. Harry
eyes them...stalls.
JULIAN
Mr. Langer? Did you take any Viagra
today? Mr. Langer?
HARRY
No. No Viagra.
26.
JULIAN
You're positive?
HARRY
I don't take Viagra. Don't need
Viagra.
The Women grab looks at each other, know they shouldn't be
there. They turn away.
JULIAN
Great. Just needed to be sure
because I put nitroglycerin into
your-drip and if you had taken
Viagra, the combo would make your
heart leap right out of your
body...
CLOSE - HARRY'S EYES - PANICKED
As he watches the NITROGLYCERIN make it's way DOWN THE TUBE
and APPROACH HIS ARM. Just as the amber liquid is about to
enter his bloodstream he YANKS the IV out of his arm. The
drip is knocked onto the ground. The Women shriek as the
Nurses scurry to clean up. Erica and Zoe rush out, Marin
hangs back. Harry catches the look on her face.
JULIAN
Let's give him an aspirin and
Metoprolol 5mg...
HARRY
Sorry, had an audience...
(clutching his chest)
JULIAN
It's okay. ..it was a great save.
(to Nurse)
Let's start the thrombolytic protocol.
"4000 units of heparin. Mr. Langer, if
this works and I have every reason to
believe it will, it's going to reverse
what's going on so there will be little
or no damage to your heart. You with me?
(Harry nods. Julian places
his hand on Harry's)
Okay, here we go.
THE HALLWAY
Marin paces, smoking. Erica sits. Zoe leans against the wall.
MARIN
Oh, man, what if he doesn't make
it? I don't know who to contact.
27.
MARIN (CONT'D)
I don't know his family. I've gone
out to dinner with the guy three
times. I hardly know him.
ERICA
He's gonna make it. Don't worry.
M
He's like a bulldog. He'll make it.
ARIN
This is a nightmare. I go out with
a guy who's so old, he takes
Viagra.
ERICA
Are you nuts? You go out with a guy
who's so old he's having a heart
attack!
ZOE
All I can say is, thank God it didn't
happen when he was inside you. That could
be life altering.
Julian rounds the corner of the corridor. Marin rushes toward
him, her face begging for good news.
JULIAN
Your Dad's gonna be okay.
MARIN
Oh, he's not my Dad...
JULIAN
I'm sorry.
(then)
Your Grandad's gonna be okay.
MARIN
(throws her arms around
him)
Oh, thank you so much. But he's not my...
oh we're not related. He's just a friend.
JULIAN
Sorry.
His sweet apologetic smile is not lost on Marin. Zoe and
Erica join them.
JULIAN
I'm Dr. Mercer. Mr. Langer did have a
mild heart attack. I gave him something
to break up the clot in his artery and it
worked beautifully.
28.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
His EKG returned to normal almost
immediately which means I don't expect
any permanent damage. He's very lucky.
ERICA
(shoulders sagging)
Thank you. . .
JULIAN
No, whoever got him here so fast should
be thanked. Another half hour and I don't
know if this would've worked.
Marin pats her Mom on the back.
ERICA
Oh, man...
(realizing it all now)
This was...intense.
Erica wipes away a tear. Nothing could surprise her more.
JULIAN
We're out of the woods. I've given him
something to sleep, it might make him a
little loopy at first but then it should
knock him out.
(to Erica)
You're Mrs. Langer?
ERICA
No, no I'm just... No. I'm Erica Barry. .
He was having dinner at our house. I just
met him this afternoon.
JULIAN
You're Erica Barry?
ERICA
Yes.
JULIAN
The playwright?
ERICA
Yes...
JULIAN
What a pleasure. I'm a huge fan.
Huge fan.
ERICA
Really? Oh, thanks... This is my
daughter, Marin, my sister, Zoe...
29.
Julian says Hi to each then returns his attention fully and
devotedly to Erica. Takes her in.
JULIAN
Wow.
CLOSE - A JAPANESE TEA POT
Julian pours steaming hot tea into 3 paper cups.
MARIN - CLOSE
Sitting in the hospital corridor as JULIAN'S HAND ENTERS HER
FRAME and hands her a cup of tea. She looks up at him with
more adorableness than most men could handle. She blows on
M
the steam.
ARIN
Thanks.
Camera Pans to ZOE. Sitting next to Marin. She is also handed
a Cup of Tea. Even she softens as she looks up at Julian.
ZOE
Thank you Doctor.
This is all beginning to feel a little like the Step Sisters
trying on the Glass Slipper. Until we get to Erica, not
paying any attention at all as she is handed her Tea.
ERICA
Oh. . .Hey. . .Ew. . .Hot. Thanks.
JULIAN
(eyes on Erica)
You're welcome. May I join you?
ERICA
Yeah. Sure. This is very nice of
you.
JULIAN
First year of medical school you
learn what can keep you up all
night without making you nuts.
Green Tea beats everything plus
it's a great antioxidant. Cheers.
MARIN
(turning on the charm)
So, urn, do you always work nights?
30.
JULIAN
Usually two or-three a week, gives
me a chance for a real life during
the day. . .
(immediately turns back to
Erica)
You know, I heard you had a place
in the Hamptons. I really am a very
big fan. I honestly think I've seen
every play you've ever written.
ERICA
I think some were written before
your time. There are some Marin's
never even seen.
JULIAN
No, I'm pretty sure I've seen them
all and I saw the last one twice.
Zoe nudges Erica as a Nurse enters from the ER.
NURSE
Doctor, we've got a walk in, may
need stitches. . .
JULIAN
(rises)
I'll check on MI. Langer...if he's
asleep; you all might want to get
some shut eye and come back in the
morning. Great to meet you Erica.
Ladies. . .
The Women wave and watch him exit.
The second he's gone:
ERICA
(to Marin)
Okay, now that's a perfect a guy
for you. He's adorable.
MARIN
Mother! I've never seen a man less
interested in me.
ZOE
Or more interested in you.
ERICA
Me? He's thirty years old.
MARIN
No, he's older than that.
31.
ZOE
Who cares how old, he is. I mean,
he's not my type, he's like a
gorgeous wholesome doctor but, he's
perfect for you and hot for you,
which makes him really perfect.
ERICA
Stop it. He likes my work. Not me.
(they just stare at her)
It's insane. I would never.
(off Zoe's look)
Shut. Up.
Just then, Harry stumbles into the corridor in his Hospital
Z
Gown, pretty out of it.
OE
Yuh-oh.
MARIN
(rises)
Harry....
Confused, Harry turns around, a little lost, giving the Women
a FULL VIEW OF HIS BARE ASS. The Women muffle screams.
MARIN
Harry! Over here!
He faces them.
HARRY
Honey, I want to go home. Can you
call Lowell to pick me up?
MARIN
(confused)
Lowell?
Harry wobbles. Is he going to fall? Marin freezes, looks to
her Mom for help. Erica rushes to Harry.
ERICA
Harry, you have to get back in bed.
HARRY
Woman. And I say that as a
compliment... You saved my life.
(kisses her hand)
Soft.. .
( then)
I don't remember your name but I
thank you from the bottom of my...
32.
He falls on Erica, totally out of it, his head on her breast,
his mouth open.
ERICA
(afraid to breathe)
Ugh. Look at this, even
unconscious, he's a lech.
The Nurses rush out and peel Harry off Erica.
NURSE
Mr. Langer, you shouldn't be
standing.
HARRY
Got to take a whiz girls.
NURSE
We'll take care of that for you,
Mr. Langer.
Harry turns back to the Women, smiling. He likes that idea.
LOVES that idea.
HARRY
Okay. You take care of it for me,
sweetheart. I'd like to see that...
As he walks away, his bare ass shines like a full moon in a
desert sky.
MARIN
This is the most insane night of my
life.
ZOE
Yeah, but just admit that was one
great ass for a guy that age.
CLOSE - A LARGE VASE OF YELLOW ROSES - 36 HOURS LATER
A Nurse slides the Roses down the counter of her station.
NURSE
Now what can I do you for?
She looks across at a neat as a pin Man in his early forties,
Prada suit, crisp white shirt, dark tie. He's a Gershwin tune
of a man. A throwback to a kinder world. This is. LOWELL,
Harry's Houseman/Chef/all around Man Friday.
LOWELL
I'm here for Mr. Harry Langer.
Julian ENTERS the Nurse's station.
33.
NURSE
(to Julian)
Are we discharging Hurricane Harry?
JULIAN
Yes we are. Hi, I'm Dr. Mercer.
Come on, I'll take you to him.
Julian EXITS the Nurse's Station. Lowell, carrying the
flowers, follows. He nods to TWO TALL LEGGY MINI SKIRTED
ASSISTANT TYPES, KIM and LEXI who follow. Both pack cell
J
phones, note pads, carry balloons, flowers and shopping bags.
ULIAN
And you are. . ?
LOWELL
Lowell St. James'. Mr. Langer's
houseman, chef... general valet..
JULIAN
Well that sounds like a pretty,
interesting job.
LOWELL
Fifteen years. Never a dull moment.
They arrive at:
A PRIVATE ROOM
where Harry lies on the bed, dressed and ready to go. He
squints as he reads a pamphlet at arms's distance called,
"Heart Attack -- Bouncing Back".
JULIAN
Okay, Harry, looks like we're going
to have to let you go.
Harry sits up too fast, lies right back down. Lowell looks
like he might cry. The Girls hold back.
HARRY
Take it easy kids, I just sat up
too fast. Doc, tell them. Am I in
good shape? How were my tests this
morning?
JULIAN
He's doing extremely well.
LOWELL
(holding back tears)
Can I hug him?
34.
JULIAN
Absolutely.
Harry stands and indulges Lowell in a deep hug. Lowell's
shoulders shake as he sobs.
HARRY
Okay, Okay. Let's not get goofy. We
got no thin , but good news here.
LOWELL
I must say, you do look good...
considering. You have a little
extra baggage under your eyes, but
I know how to fix that.
HARRY
(to Julian)
See what good hands I'm in. Did you
meet my gorgeous assistants?
JULIAN
Not formally.
HARRY
Girls... .my Doctor, Julian Mercer.
(then)
Honey, did you bring the CDs?
Kim hands Harry a shopping bag full of CDs.
HARRY
(to Julian)
These are for you...
(to the Girls)
The man loves Hip Hop.
JULIAN
(checking out the bag)
Maybe not this much but...
HARRY
And did you bring the other thing?
Lexi hands Harry another bag. Harry reaches in and pulls out
a small leather box, hands it to Julian.
HARRY
This is just to thank you for your
brilliance the other night. I hope
it suits you.
JULIAN
(opening the box)
Wow. This is.. .Jesus, this is the
most gorgeous watch I've ever seen.
35.
HARRY
- Oh, good. It's a Piaget.
(to Girls)
He likes it.
JULIAN
No, I love it and this is incredibly
generous of you but I can't accept it.
HARRY
You save my life and you end up
with some CDs?
JULIAN
No, I end up seeing you walk out of
here and I do get paid you know -
MARIN (O.S.)
-- Knock, knock.
T
hey all turn, see Marin at the door. She waves to Harry,
more reserved than normal.
JULIAN
Harry, I'll see you on the way out.
LOWELL
(whispers)
We'll pull up the car.
Everyone EXITS leaving Marin and Harry alone. Harry sits on
the bed. Marin joins him. Harry places his hand on her thigh.
All she notices is his hospital bracelet.
HARRY
So, I'm some great date, huh?
MARIN
Yeah... Mr. Excitement.
HARRY
Tell me somethin', we haven't actually
had sex yet, have we?
MARIN
No we haven't. You're correct on
that one.
HARRY
Something to live for.
Marin smiles, kisses Harry on the cheek.
36.
HARRY
Down to the cheek.
(that's big, he digests
that one)
Come on, let's get outta here.
Erica puts away groceries, a little on edge. Her back is to a
Man in his fifties, who sits at the island, eating a
sandwich. He wears sweats and a baseball cap. His natural
expression is -- worried. This is DAVE.
DAVE
This is the best turkey sandwich I
ever had in my life. What kind of
mustard is this?
ERICA
(not turning around)
I don't know.
DAVE
All right, don't get pissy. It's
not Dijon, right?
ERICA
Don't get pissy. ..you say that 'cause
this, of course, would never happen to
you. .1 come out here for peace and quiet
and suddenly I'm a character in a Kaufman
and Hart play.
(the phone RINGS)
And the phone does not stop.
(phone STOPS RINGING)
And it's never for me!
Lowell ENTERS with the Bed Tray.
LOWELL
Sorry to interrupt.
ERICA
That's fine Lowell, I'll take that.
LOWELL
No, please, allow me.
ERICA
No, no, I'll take it. No problem.
Erica takes the bed tray as Lowell EXITS.
ERICA
The man does not know my name and
I'm doing his dishes.
Lexi ENTERS, all 5'10" of her. Dave suddenly looks alive. She
carries an empty water glass.
39.
LEX
Hi Erica. Um...where should I put
E
this?
RICA
Right here. I'll take it.
LEXI
And Harry has a headache. Do you
have any Tylenol?
ERICA
Tylenol yes. ..
(reaches in cabinet)
LEXI
(extends her hand to Dave)
Hi. I'm Lexi, Harry's second
assistant.
DAVE
Hey...Dave Klein. How ya doin'?
Erica hands Lexi the Tylenol, she thanks her and EXITS.
ERICA
(holding the water glass)
Where should I put this? It's an
empty water glass. What are the
choices?
DAVE
(rises)
I'm gettin' outta your hair.
ERICA
Thank you.
DAVE
So you're not ready to show me any
pages? I'm not putting pressure on
you, I'm just asking.
ERICA
I haven't written a word. I'm on
page twelve and the first eleven
pages stink.
DAVE
So you have one good page.
(then)
How tall do you think that girl
was?
Before Erica can respond, Marin ENTERS.
40.
MARIN
Dad! I didn't know you were here.
DAVE
I'm just on my way out, bubbee.
MARIN
Well, I was just gonna drive into the
city with Zoe but if you're driving back,
I'd much rather go with you.
DAVE
I have to meet someone before I go...
ERICA
(to Marin)
Wait wait wait wait. You're leaving, Zoe's
leaving, the entourage is leaving. And I'm
supposed to stay here with him alone?
MARIN
The doctor said" he's 'sending over
a Nurse in the morning...
ERICA
The morning? That's nineteen hours from
now...
(takes a deep breath)
Okay, I can handle this. I'm just going
to get into a zen' place, play music,
cook, write, focus...
DAVE
She never changes...
ERICA
(setting him straight)
Yes. Maybe that's a good thing.
Erica cooks, softly singing along in French.
HARRY (O.S.)
Smells great in here.
Surprised, Erica turns to find Harry leaning in the doorway
in his pajamas, robe and slippers. No one's ever had more
gorgeous clothes to sleep in. His presence disarms her.
41.
ERICA
Coq au Vin...
(he looks confused)
H
Chicken cooked in red wine...
ARRY
French Food... French music...
ERICA
Part of my play takes place in Paris so
I'm hoping this helps me think. I'm
hopin'...How you feeling?
HARRY
Well, I walked all the way in here,
only bumping into two chairs and an
ottoman.
ERICA
Everyone bumps into that ottoman.
Harry appreciates the thought. Before it has time to become
awkward, the Phone RINGS.
HARRY
Hey, thanks for letting me...
ERICA
Yeah, no...it's fine.
(answering the phone)
Hello. Yes, he is.
(hands the phone to Harry)
HARRY
(into phone)
Hello. Hey sweets...
(Erica hates this)
Oh, you got the flowers? Are they
pretty?
Erica can't stand this. She puts on her glasses and skims her
recipe.
HARRY
Hey, can I call you in a little
bit. What's your number doll?
(spots a pad and pencil)
Harry squints, can't see what he's writing...backs his head
away from the pad. Erica hands him her glasses.
HARRY
(slips them on, jots down
the number)
Okay... Call you in a little.
42.
Harry hangs up and hands the glasses back to Erica.
HARRY
Same prescription...
ERICA
Look, Harry, it's not like in any stretch
of the imagination, I think you're all
that right for my daughter but I don't
really appreciate hearing you on the
phone with other women. It's like I'm an
accomplice to you cheating, it's...
HARRY
Your daughter knows I see other women.
ERICA
She does? I mean, fine, it's none
of my business...but...
(struggles to open a
bottle of wine)
HARRY
She knows I'm not monogamous...We've
discussed it.
ERICA
Great? And that's what? Why are you
proud of that?
HARRY
Not proud. Just honest. Your daughter
said she likes that about me.
(takes the wine and opens
it with ease.)
ERICA
My daughter is confused when it comes to men.
HARRY
I don't blame her. We're confusing.
Harry hands her the open wine bottle.
Erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table. The CLOCK tells us
it's a little after ONE A.M. Annoyed by the ringing phone, she
points her remote at the CD Player and stops' the song. Harry
answers the phone in his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her
remote, starts the song again, starts typing again. Now the other
line RINGS. She looks over at the phone watching one RED LIGHT
"BLINK, while the other line is answered.
ERICA
What am I doing?
She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it.
She clicks on her AOL ICON and is told: AOL CANNOT CONNECT. LINE
BUSY. She's pissed. Then, worse, she SMELLS something.
Harry is on the phone, smoking a cigar. His pajama top is
unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place. His bed is a mess,
laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor. Erica stands
in the doorway. He quickly hides his cigar.
HARRY
(into phone)
Can you hold a see, doll?
(looks to Erica)
Hey.
ERICA
Okay, here's the thing. I really don't
want to play the part of the uptight
Nurse to your bad boy patient. If you
want to have another heart attack, go
ahead, it's your life but I have work to
do and I don't have time to make another
run to the hospital because you're
filling your already clogged arteries
with smoke but more importantly, I'd
rather not have my house smell like a
pool hall.
44.
Erica holds out a partially filled water glass for Harry to
deposit his cigar in.
HARRY
I have a question for you.
She waits. She doesn't say anything.
ERICA
What? Do I Hhave to say what?
ARRY
Have you always been like this or
do I bring this out in you?
She shakes the water glass, waiting for the deposit. He drops
the cigar in.
HARRY
I don't think I've ever had this
effect on a woman before.
ERICA
(picking up the
newspapers)
And what effect do you think you're
having on me?
HARRY
I don't quite recognize it, that's how I
know I've never had it before.
Erica rolls her eyes as she finishes cleaning up.
HARRY
So you don't sleep?
ERICA
I only need about four hours a night.
HARRY
Me too. Never slept eight hours in my
life.
ERICA
Me either. I wish I could. ..but...
(re: curtains)
Want me to shut these, sun comes in
pretty strong in the morning.
HARRY
Sure. . . thanks. . .
ERICA
(drawing the drapes)
Who you talking to at this hour?
45.
HARRY
A friend in L.A. It's only ten out there.
ERICA
And that's not past her bedtime?
HARRY
So you don't get more mellow as the hours
pass?
ERICA
(heading out)
Good night, Harry.
HARRY
Can I ask you one other thing?
(Erica turns)
What's with the turtlenecks? It's
the middle of summer.
ERICA
Now seriously, why do you care what I
wear?
HARRY
Just curious.
ERICA
I like them. I've always liked them. I'm
just a turtleneck kinda gal.
HARRY
You ever get hot?
ERICA
No.
HARRY
Never?
ERICA
Not lately.
Almost TWO. Erica is writing, her eyes go to the phone with
the typing paper over it. She LIFTS a corner of the paper,
takes a peek. The one lit line GOES OUT. Finally. "Erica
turns off her computer, sits for a second. No one has rattled
her cage like this in quite some time. And no, she doesn't
like it. She stands, starts to undress.
ANGLE - THE FLOOR
46.
As Erica's TURTLENECK lands on it. Then her BRA, then her
PANTS then her PANTIES.
ERICA - NAKED - TIGHT SHOT
She crosses through the room on her way to the Bathroom. She
passes by her partially open door, happens to look out INTO
THE HALLWAY AND SEES:
HARRY - PLANTED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER
Seeing it all.
ERICA - SCREAMS
and DROPS OUT OF FRAME.
HARRY
flustered, spins around, loses his balance, crashes into the
wall, covers his eyes.
HARRY
I'm sorry! Oh, God am I sorry.
ERICA (O.S.)
What are you doing?!?
HARRY
Trying to find the kitchen!
ERICA (O.S.)
Back here???
HARRY
I-I got confused..! It was dark. I didn't
really see anything. Just your tits and a
little of your-
Erica SLAMS HER DOOR. Photos on the wall shake.
HARRY
This is gonna be murder.
A very wide MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room
toward the Front Door. Just as she opens the door, Erica
ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. Pretty
much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few
packages.
NURSE
Good bye Mrs. Barry.
47.
ERICA
Good bye? You're leaving? That's
not good.
NURSE
Been fired.
ERICA
Fired?
You just started.
HARRY
Not fired darlin'. Just not needed.
Erica hardly looks at You Know Who who appears to be fresh
out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs.
ERICA
What do you mean, not needed? Of
course we need her. She's gonna
take care of you and feed you and...
HARRY
-- No, no, I'm actually feeling
pretty perky today. Making quite a
recovery. . .
(opening the screen door)
Sorry for the trouble Mrs.
Gimble... Take care, dear.
Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd. Mrs.
Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits. Erica, now
alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses.
Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest,
pats it.
HARRY
Listen, about last night.
ERICA
Yeah. How 'bout we never talk about that?
(hands him some pills)
I was at the drugstore. Your
prescriptions were ready. They said take
these two with food and this one without.
HARRY
Honestly, you were in silhouette.
ERICA
I think that's talkin' about it.
HARRY
I really didn't see all that much.
48.
ERICA
(heading toward her room)
Yip. There you go.
HARRY
Okay. Won't mention it again but...
ERICA
(almost out of the room)
Goin' to work, Harry.
HARRY
(yells)
You saw my ass, you don't see me
acting nuts, wearing hats and
glasses and weird get ups...
The Sound of a DOOR SLAM. - Harry flinches.
Harry and Julian sit on the bed. Julian takes Harry's blood
pressure.
HARRY
Yes or no. What's the deal, can I
go?
JULIAN
You still getting dizzy?
HARRY
Not as much.
JULIAN
Out of breath?
HARRY
Only sometimes.
JULIAN
(listens with stethoscope)
How's Erica treating you?
HARRY
Who?
JULIAN
(nods toward Living Room)
Erica. . .
HARRY
Her? Oh, she's a major piece of
work. The woman wears turtlenecks
in the middle of the summer.
49.
HARRY (CONT'D)
She's beyond uptight. Almost makes
her fun to be around.
JULIAN
Uptight? That's funny. I haven't
noticed that.
HARRY
Try livin' with her.
Julian takes Harry's pulse.
HARRY
(with secret glee)
I actually saw her naked last
night.
JULIAN
That doesn't sound so uptight.
HARRY
It was an accident. She thought I
was asleep, I thought her room was
the kitchen.
JULIAN
You know what Freud said - there
are no accidents.
HARRY
Trust me. This was an accident. Although,
why would she be walking around naked
when she knows I'm 20 feet away.
JULIAN
Why would you think her bedroom was
the kitchen?
HARRY
It was dark, it was two in the
morning.
JULIAN
That could explain why she was walking
around naked. Deep breath...
HARRY
You know I've never seen a woman
that age naked before.
JULIAN
You're kidding?
HARRY
Hey, we're not all doctors.
50.
JULIAN
Well, I think she's very beautiful
and she's a fantastic writer, you
know.
HARRY
No, I don't know...
JULIAN
Erica Barry? She's pretty major.
(writing a prescription)
So, you date her daughter?
HARRY
Okay, now she's a great chick. Must take
after the father. Which reminds me...Doc,
what (about Mr. Midnight here. . ?
indicates his dick)
When can I be up and running in
that department?
JULIAN
I think Mr. Midnight needs to stay
put for another couple of weeks.
HARRY
But it won't kill me when I do it, right?
JULIAN
It's exercise. It'll be good for you. And
just so you know, I'm told after a heart
attack, if you can climb a flight of
stairs, you can have sex.
CUT TO:
A LOW ANGLE OF A STAIRCASE
Which goes from the beach up to Erica's deck. Harry stands at
the bottom of the stairs in his robe, velvet slippers and
sunglasses.' He looks up to the top of the stairs as if it's
Mt. Everest. Bravely, he climbs the first few steps. Not bad.
After two more, he's out of breath. Determined, he holds onto
the railing and drags himself up to the next step. Happy with
himself, he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one
more...and then, he's so out of breath, he can barely move,
yet he reaches up the railing and tries to hike himself up
one more.
INT . KITCHEN - SAME TIME
The tea kettle WHISTLES as Erica and Julian stand on either
side of her island. Erica reaches for a tea bag.
51.
ERICA
So, you're saying, he's not ready
to travel at all? Not even by
plane? Train?
JULIAN
I don't think so...
(sees her disappointment)
It's been tough, huh?
ERICA
Well, he fired the Nurse after an
hour, now says he doesn't need one.
He's a bit of a workout.. .yeah.
JULIAN
How are you holding up?
ERICA
Oh, fine. .I'm fine, I'm...
JULIAN
One more fine and I won't believe you.
The Phone RINGS.
ERICA
Oh, shoot, hold on...
(into phone)
Hello. Hey...Oh, hi...
ANGLE - JULIAN
Smitten. Just something about her. Watching her.
ANGLE - ERICA
Not noticing, pouring water for her tea.
ERICA
(into phone)
No, I'm finally getting to it...
Erica sees Julian sliding a slip of paper over to her. Looks
over at it. It's a piece of paper from his prescription pad.
On it is written...Have dinner with me tonight? Erica looks
up at him. Stunned. J
ULIAN
(heading out)
Pick you up around seven?
ERICA
W-What about the patient?
52.
JULIAN
Like he said, he doesn't need a
nurse.
We begin to hear strains of another French song.
Erica at her desk, typing. The Music plays from the CD
player. As much as she doesn't want it to be true, this
attention from Julian has fueled her.
THE LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER
Harry, dressed for the first time, wearing khaki's and a
summer shirt, strolls through the Living Room a bit cautious.
HARRY
(yells, warning-like)
I'm Walking Around The house!
ERICA Laughs. Even she knows this is funny. Harry arrives at
her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in.
ERICA
Listen, I've decided to get over the
whole "you saw me naked" thing. So, we
don't have to deal with it anymore. Okay?
HARRY
Good, 'cause I've been hiding from
you all day.
ERICA
I know. You want to come in?
HARRY
I don't want to break your rhythm
or anything.
ERICA
That would be wishful thinking.
Harry ENTERS cautiously and curiously.
HARRY
Beautiful painting. So I'm gonna
venture out there and go for a
short walk...
ERICA
You up to that?
53.
HARRY
My doctor recommended it. I gotta
build up to stairs and stuff like
that. You wouldn't want to join me?
ERICA
That means you don't want me to?
HARRY
No, I was asking if you wanted to.
ERICA
Oh, well, I would but...I don't
usually like to break once I've
started writing so I probably
shouldn't, not that a little fresh
air would hurt but...
HARRY
It's just a walk Erica, not a
marriage proposal.
ERICA
You know my name.
HARRY
Erica Jane Barry. I looked you up
on the internet.
Harry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry's body, past
the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to
M
his face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR:
ARIN (O.S.)
Hi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave
a message and I'll call you back.
HARRY
Hey, it's me...just sitting around
looking at your baby pictures...
Thinking about you...
59.
He hangs up, dials another number.
ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hi and HI, you've reached Brooke and
Shannon. For Brooke push one, for -
Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as
funky as he wants.
HARRY
Everybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old
old old Har...
Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. He rummages
around, finds ERICA'S SCRAPBOOK, pulls it out, randomly opens
it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck.
Harry smiles.
Harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He
notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. Harry's brown
stone sits at the top of the pile.
HARRY
(complimented)
Top of the heap...
CLOSE ON JULIAN
Staring at Erica. He can't get enough of her. They're in a
ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica's blushing for the
first time in twenty-five years.
ERICA
-- So, when the land came up, I snatched it
and the house was built in record time and...
(blushing to death)
It's like a thousand degrees in here.
JULIAN
You know, they say doctors fall for
people who need rescuing, that we have a
need to take care of someone.
ERICA
Really? I never heard that one.
(starts fanning herself
with the menu)
Julian, how old are you, like...
JULIAN
-- Thirty-three.
60.
ERICA
Thirty-three.-Okay, so, I'm twenty years
older than you. More than twenty years
older than you.
JULIAN
You look fabulous.
ERICA
Thank you
but you know, I'm not sure
where you
were headed with that thing you
were just
saying, but in terms of us, you
just want
to be friends, right?
JULIAN
Honestly? No.
ERICA
Well, then, what is it that you...
want to be?
J
ULIAN
I think I'd embarrass you if I told
you.
ERICA
I was embarrassed just getting
dressed to see you.
JULIAN
This may surprise you but some
women consider me quite the guy.
I've never been married. I'm a
doctor. You wouldn't believe what
catnip that is for some women.
ERICA
Oh yes I would. But, you don't like
girls your own age?
JULIAN
I do very much. But I've never met one
I've taken to quite like this and when
something happens to you that's never
happened to you before, don't you have to
at least find out what it is?
ERICA
I suppose but, see, I don't date
all that much or all that well...
JULIAN
Oh, come on, you must beat them
away with a stick.
61.
ERICA
Now you're kidding, right? No, guys
my age, the ones I've met...well,
I'm not that regular a person and
they really like regular.
JULIAN
Men your age may be really stupid,
you ever think of that?
(takes her hand)
ERICA
Yes I have. Many times.
JULIAN
(looks from her hand to
her eyes)
There's something radically wrong with
the idea that no one loves you.
Ow. Right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck.
Julian kisses her palm, then her.
JULIAN
I knew you'd smell good.
ERICA
It's just...soap...
JULIAN
How much is soap that smells like this?
ERICA
I don't know. I got it at the market.
JULIAN
Erica, you're incredibly sexy.
ERICA
No, swear to God, I'm not...
MEANWHILE, HARRY IS SOUND ASLEEP ON ERICA'S BED
Her scrapbook open against his chest. We HEAR the SOUND OF
ACAR pulling up to the house. Harry wakes up. Oh shit.
He
leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days. A
bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for
other evidence then hightails it out of there.
Erica enters, letting out a huge sigh. She's brought back to
reality when she hears the TV in Harry's room. She heads his
way, then changes her mind and stops.
62.
ERICA
(yells)
I'm back...
HARRY (O.S.)
You have fun?
ERICA
It was interesting. So... Good night.
Harry's in bed, clearly disappointed that she didn't stop in.
HARRY
(yells)
'Night...
Erica, in pj's and glasses, sits at her laptop, writing. She
hears the CHIME of someone INSTANT MESSENGERING HER. It a
message from HARRYL37. It says: What R U doing?
W
e go BACK AND FORTH between their TWO ROOMS.
She answers: Writing. Hi. What R U doing?
He writes: Watching Joan Rivers sell jewelry.
Erica laughs when he adds: So was your date a date?
She types: I think so...
He types: I told ya. (then) You hungry?
Surprised, she types: I just had dinner.
He writes: Yeah, but women never eat on dates.
ERICA
(to herself)
How does he know everything!
She hesitates then types: Actually am a little hungry but,
I'm in my pjs.
He writes: Me too. Pajama party?
SHE stares at the screen biting her lip. HE does the same.
63.
Erica rises, LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, checks out her boobs in her
pajamas. They look so low. She opens a drawer, rifles through it,
takes out a bra, takes out a better bra.
IN HIS BATHROOM, Harry fixes his hair, tries to make more of it
than he has.
Erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas, checks out her boobs
again. Better. She adjusts the straps. Lifts them higher.
Erica and Harry ENTER FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM, both in
their pajamas.
HARRY
We are cute...
ERICA
This is pretty unusual for me.
I'm not
used to having sleepovers.
HARRY
Me either.
ERICA
Really? With your social life?
HARRY
My, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping.
Sleeping is something I prefer to do alone.
ERICA
Okay, good to know.
(heading for the kitchen)
So, what are you hungry for?
HARRY
(joining her)
What are my choices? I mean I know you
think I'm not very discriminating but...
She looks through the fridge.
ERICA
Oh, God, what's the difference what I
think. I can't imagine what you think of
me. Okay, so... Pasta, left over coq au
vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.
HARRY
Pancakes.
ERICA
Totally what I wanted. Blueberries?
64.
HARRY
You ever miss being married? I bet you
were great at it.
ERICA
Sometimes I miss it. At night.. But not
that much anymore. Was one of us just
saying something interesting?
HARRY
You said you can't imagine what I think
of you.
ERICA
Oh, right, but you don't have to answer
that.
HARRY
Okay.
ERICA
I mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be
curious but...'
HARRY
will you tell me first why you only
miss being married at night?
ERICA
(cracking eggs)
Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much
at night and the "alone" thing happens at
night and sleeping by myself took some
getting used to. But I got the hang of
it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the
bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have
a side when no one has the other side.
She starts mixing the batter.
HARRY
Okay, now I'm convinced what I
think of you is right.
(Erica waits. . . )
You are a tower of strength.
ERICA
(shoulders sagging)
Ughhhhhhhhhh... .
HARRY
Try not to rate my answer.
ERICA
I'm sorry. It's just...I'm sorry.
65.
HARRY
You're like a thoroughbred in a world of
mutts. No, you know what you are, you're
like a great portrait over a fireplace.
Words have been invented to describe
women like you.
ERICA
( fearful)
Such as?
HARRY
Flinty
and...Impervious.
ERICA
So you think I'm inhuman.
HARRY
No. I think you're formidable.
ERICA
But cold and distant. Like I'm
frozen in some painting...
HARRY
Not at all. I think you're strength
defines you.
(sees how sensitive she
is)
But it's thrilling when your defenses are
down arid you're not isolated. That, I
believe, is your winning combo. A killer
combo actually.
ERICA
... So I can't decide if you hate me or if
maybe you're the only person who ever got
me.
HARRY
I don't hate you.
The moment is broken when they HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN and
HIGH HEELS APPROACHING.
ERICA
Hello?
Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding
a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy.
MARIN
Room service!
ERICA
What are you doing here at this hour?
66.
Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one
of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths
down his hair. Erica catches all this.
MARIN
(enters, kisses Erica)
I
had this big photography auction
tonight, then I went out with a
bunch of people, I checked my
messages and got this so sad
message from Harry so bored out
here. I thought I should come out
and at least see how he was doing.
(kisses Harry on the
cheek)
Thank you for the gorgeous flowers
by the way. They were so huge...
Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers.
Harry notes Erica's reaction.
MARIN
So how are you guys?
(sets down the Zabar's
bag)
Oh, this is too sweet. You're making
pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your
pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting.
ERICA
Don't be silly. You know I never
sleep and this one doesn't sleep
either. It's... .What's in the
bag?
MARIN
(reaches into the bag)
A quart of matzoh ball soup for
Harry. I know it's not the remedy
for heart problems but it is low
cholesterol.
ERICA
(hating to correct her)
But high sodium.
MARIN
Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your
favorite raisin-bread. And for
me...
(reaches into the bag)
My favorite Vodka.
Marin's cell phone RINGS.
67.
MARIN
(into phone)
Hello? No I'm here, babe. Made record
time. Everyone's still there?
Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches
her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut
and tosses it in her purse.
ERICA
So, Mar, now that you're here, why
don't you finish the pancakes and
I'll get back to work...
MARIN
Mom! I just got here, hold on.
She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice.
MARIN
So your ex-husband stood me up
today. We were supposed to have
lunch at Barneys . He never showed
up. Was he always like this?
ERICA
Honey, I don't know...
MARIN
This is what happens after a couple
gets divorced, the kid inherits all
the problems. Not that I'm a kid.
(then to Harry, the flirt
in her coming back)
So how are you, how do you feel?
When can you go home?
Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She
picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her
bag.
ERICA
I really am gonna do a little work.
. . you two catch up. . . and just
flip these Hin like two seconds.
ARRY
You don't want pancakes anymore?
ERICA
I, uh, I don't think I...I...
(looks at Marin so)
gorgeous, next to him
No. I don't.
68.
Marin watches her mother EXIT then looks to Harry, his eyes
following her Mom out the door. She's sees a look on Harry's
face she never remotely saw when he looked at her. At first
she's shocked. He likes my mother??? Then a flash of
jealousy. He likes my mother!?! Then pure joy - realizing how
perfect it is.
Erica, back in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket.
Marin ENTERS HER FRAME, baseball cap, sunglasses, picking
cherries.
MARIN
I'm breaking up with Harry.
ERICA
Why? What do you mean?
MARIN
'Cause I met someone else.
ERICA
In the two days you've been gone?
MARIN
You know me, my life's crazy. I meet a
thousand people everyday. Also, let's
face it, the guy's insanely old for me.
I'd be nuts to keep this going.
ERICA
True, but you know he is....
MARIN
-- I know. He's soulful when you
don't expect it, right?
ERICA
It's unnerving.
MARIN
Now, Mom, if you could handle this,
I was thinking... you and Harry...
ERICA
I can't handle it. Wouldn't want to
handle it.
MARIN
But you're only saying that 'cause
you think he and I have had sex.
ERICA
Yes. Lower your voice. Haven't you?
69.
MARIN
(whispering)
Never even got close. Swear to God.
(Erica digests this)
Just puttin' that out there...'cause for
two people who are convinced they got
life beat, there's was somethin' cooking
in the kitchen last night other than
pancakes.
Erica looks out her KITCHEN WINDOW and SEES Marin and Harry
TALKING ON THE BEACH. She leans so far to see them, she's
about to lose her balance. The Phone RINGS, she reaches for
it and slips right Out Of Frame.
ERICA (O.S.)
(into phone)
Hello.
Julian, in his scrubs, walks quickly down a hallway of the
J
ER, on his CELL PHONE.
ULIAN
I've waited a reasonable amount of hours
before calling you, even though you've
been on my mind since I woke up at 5:15.
I'm wondering when we could have dinner
again? I have to work the next few nights
and if we wait 'til next week, I know
you'll chicken out so how's Friday? I
know it's like a date night but I think
that's good.
ERICA
Who is this?
Julian stops short.
ERICA
I'm kidding!
JULIAN
Can you meet me at The Grill at
eight?
ERICA
Okay. Yes. That's seems fine.
I
70.
JULIAN
I look forward to, seeing you too.
Erica smiles to herself.
ON JULIAN - AS HE LEANS AGAINST A WALL
turning off the phone and grabbing his heart
NT. ERICA'S KITCHEN
Marin ENTERS through the kitchen door, looking almost a
little dazed.
MARIN
Okay, he's all yours.
ERICA
Stop that. How'd he take it?
MARIN
He just took care of it for me; He
was an ace. Elegant. Said our fate
was to be friends. ...Oh my God.
(realizes something)
He was breaking up with me. He's a
genius.
ERICA
That's impossible, he wouldn't...
MARIN
It doesn't matter, we're done and
we both feel good about it.
(hugs her)
I gotta get back.
(as she exits)
Now Erica, try to think of this as
the smartest thing you've ever done
for yourself.
Marin EXITS and the PHONE RINGS.
ERICA
(into the phone)
Hello.
HARRY
(from the beach)
Thought you'd like to know your
daughter broke up with me.
Harry and Erica talk while looking at each other through the
Kitchen Window.
71.
ERICA
I heard.
HARRY
Made up a story about meeting another
guy. Guess I wasn't so cute with an IV in
my arm.
ERICA
No, I think she really did meet
someone else.
HARRY
Hey, it's alright. Her mother
didn't like me anyway.
ERICA
(smiles)
How 'bout I bring you out some
lunch and a couple of blood
H
pressure pills?
ARRY
You're a great woman, Erica.
(Erica relaxes)
Is this why my doctor is falling in
love with you?
THE BEACH - MUSIC OVER
Erica and Harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a
picnic lunch. Harry is telling Erica a story and she screams
with laughter.
BROWN STONES IN THE SAND - MUSIC CONTINUES
Erica picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water's
edge. They talk non-stop.
A LITTLE LATER - LIGHTNING STREAKS THE SKY
Out of nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their
picnic things. The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it
as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind.
Erica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the
doors and windows. Lightning crackles across the sky and THE
LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT.
A MATCH IS STRUCK
and a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica
turns and finds Harry just looking at her. Before either of
them has time to think, they kiss.
72.
ERICA
I'm sorry.
HARRY
(truly confused)
For what?
ERICA
I just kissed you.
HARRY
No, honey, I kissed you.
Relieyed, Erica kisses him.
ERICA
I know that one was me.
HARRY
Try not to keep score.
He kisses her again and again.
HARRY
Soft lips...
ERICA
I'm so glad they still work.
I haven't used them for kissing in so long. They've been more
like for wearing lipstick and whistling and...
He kisses her quiet. Relieved, she finally fully kisses him
back. A big gorgeo~s kiss.
HARRY
Well, well, now look who's got
something that works...
They both look down at Harry. Hello, Mr. Midnight.
ERICA
And you didn't even take Via-
HARRY
(puts his finger on her
lips)
Kiss me before you make it go away.
S
he kisses him long and sweet.
ERICA'S BED
They're kissing on it. The rain pelts against the windows as
the sun goes down.
73.
HARRY
This could be world class
interesting.
(Erica nods)
Having any doubts?
ERICA
(as they kiss)
Yes.
HARRY
Me too.
ERICA
But so far the kissing is
spectacular.
(He looks at her)
I'm not grading you, just
mentioning it. Brilliant.
He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way.
He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get
to her.
HARRY
Can't get past your damn
turtleneck. . .
He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he
doesn't want to be down there yet. He comes back up when
Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer,
takes out a SCISSORS and hands it to him.
ERICA
(breathless)
Cut it off... Please.
What a brilliant invitation. He takes the scissors and starts
cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso,
between her breasts. The turtleneck falls open from the
center. When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and
it easily rips apart and there she is. He takes her in.
HARRY
You're beautiful.
She shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes.
HARRY
Open your eyes so I know you can hear me.
(she opens her eyes)
Beautiful...
They kiss and she reaches down for his pants.
74.
HARRY
What about birth control?
ERICA
Menopause.
HARRY
(thrilled)
Who's the lucky boy...
He kisses between her breasts, her stomach, heads down and
OUT OF FRAME. Erica can't quite believe life held this twist
for her. Then:,
ERICA
I think we should take your blood
pressure.
His head POPS BACK INTO FRAME. What?????
ERICA
It's irresponsible not to.
H
ARRY -' A MINUTE LATER
sprawled out on the bed. Erica straddles him and whips the
blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard. Like a warm
Jewish Mother of a Dominatrix. He looks up at her, shaking
his head...
HARRY
Nobody but you would. . .
ERICA
Yeah...so you're lucky.
Erica grabs Harry's glasses, reads the results.
ERICA
(ecstatic)
One twenty over eighty!!! Baby!
THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF - IN SLOW MOTION
hurdles recklessly into the air.
Erica gets back in her bed. She lies there for a
second,securing her armor back in place. She routinely moves
to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her
eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in
the doorway.
HARRY
I'd like to try sleeping with you.
I
80.
Erica hesitates, then moves to one side of the bed and as
Harry climbs in next to her we:
FADE THRU TO:
Harry tosses his pills in a leather bag. .. Erica enters
doing the worst job she's ever done of being strong.
ERICA
(holding some cigars)
Here you go, you can have these back now.
(Harry looks confused)
I confiscated them your first night
here...
HARRY
(smells them)
Thank you darlin' ...
ERICA
Try not to smoke them...
(hands him a small bag)
And I packed you a sandwich, just
in case your blood sugar got low.
And some of that iced-tea you like,
and a nonfat, low cholesterol
cookie. And a peach.
HARRY
what a doll...
(notices)
Got something else?
From behind her back Erica pulls out a Mason Jar filled with
all dark beach stones with ONE WHITE STONE in the center.
ERICA
Something to remember me by.
Harry hugs her. Erica awkwardly throws her arms around him
and kisses him, then kisses him better. He's moved by her.
86.
HARRY
There is that...
ERICA
And hey, we'll always have Paris.
HARRY
Honey, no words can ever express my
gratitude for taking me in and taking care
of me and...
ERICA
Hey, your heart attack could be the best
thing that ever happened to me.
HARRY
(kisses her quickly, even
faster throws out)
I love ya.
ERICA
I love you too...if that's what you said. I
don't know if it ends in 'ya' if it's an
official I love you but...
Harry expression looks something like he's in pain. Then. . .
HARRY
You're not like anybody.
ERICA
Neither are you.
Lowell drives, rattling on about all the people who have been
calling about him. Harry, in the backseat, looks back at the
house, until it is finally out of view.
Harry then looks inside the bag with the sandwich and finds an
Envelope from Erica, pulls it out, doesn't open it, places it back
in the bag then takes out his cell phone and dials.
The room is empty. Erica rushes in, picks up the phone.
E
RICA
I knew you'd call.
MARIN - WALKING IN SOHO
on her cell phone, CRYING.
87.
MARIN
Who? It's me.
INTERCUT
ERICA
What's wrong?
MARIN
I had breakfast with Dad this morning and
we're talking and he starts looking all
weir~ and then he tells me he met someone
three weeks ago and it's "really
something and then he
(sobbing now)
He tells me he's getting married. Why am
I reacting this way? I'm almost thirty
years old...
(people stare at her)
Yes, I'm crying, leave me alone.
ERICA
Who's he marrying?
MARIN
I don't know. Some chick he met three
weeks ago. She's four years older than me
and she's an Ear, Nose and Throat Doctor.
Has he lost his mind? I have a huge
auction tonight... Why do I have to be
the one to deal with this? Can you please
come in? I'm rea:~y upset, my shrink'~
away for two weeks...I know you're
working but. . .please. . ?
AN UPPER EAST SIDE STREET - A LITTLE LATER
One of those gorgeous tree lined streets from a Woody Allen
movie that makes New York seem quaint. Harry's Town Car
pulls up in front of a GORGEOUS
PRISTINE TOWNHOUSE. Harry
steps out in shades, holding an
unlit cigar. Lowell joins him
as the Front Door opens and out
pours his Two Leggy
Assistants and thumping Hip Hop
Music.
LOWELL Good to be back?
HARRY Let's find out.
A tearful Marin is changing from jeans and a T-shirt to a
proper dress and heels. Erica leans on a table, listening.
MARIN
-- Look, I get that he has a right to get
remarried, but he doesn't even know her
and she's like my age. You know what
that's like? It's like beyond creepy. And
I know he's not replacing me so why does
it feel like he is? This is crazy, right?
Crying like this...
(
lights a cigarette)
ERICA
Honey, if he's replacing anyone, it's me.
And all the statistics say divorced men
almost always remarry. That's just the
way they're built.
MARIN
(slipping on her dress)
Mom, you want to know the answer to
the big mystery of my life? Why I'm
always with the wrong guy? This is
why. Because the wrong guy can't do
this to you. You have some control
with the wrong guy. This thing I'm
feeling right now. This is my big
fear...that some guy could get me
unglued like this, like nothing's
connected. And this is just my
father! I'm just not strong enough
to handle this kind of drama.
ERICA
The drama in life is what makes you
strong.
MARIN
No, it's what makes you strong.
You've never really understood
this,but we're not all like you.
89.
MARIN (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, if I were you and my ex
husband, the man who I still allow to
direct my plays.! was getting married to
some 33 year old Ear, Nose and Throat
Babe, I'd be bonkers. And look at you.
(realizes)
You've never looked better, by the way.
(sinks)
My anti-depressant is obviously not
working. It should cover events like this
shouldn't it?
ERICA
Since when do you take an antidepressant?
MARIN
Ugggh, mother, do you know anyone who
doesn't?
ERICA
Yes. Me.
MARIN
I rest my case.
A KNOCK on the door.
VOICE FROM OUTSIDE
Marin, we're all set.
MARIN
Mom, can you do one other really
big thing for me? Just say yes.
ERICA
(taking two Turns)
Anything bubee.
MARIN
Will you come out to dinner tonight
with me and Dad and the fiance?
ERICA
Absolutely not. No.
MARIN
Please. He wants me to meet her and I can
not go alone. I already asked him if you
could come and he said it was fine and
she said it was fine. Look, you're gonna
have to meet her too, so, we might as
well meet her together. Come on, you know
you can handle it.
90.
Erica pauses, thinks M
about it. She knows she can too.
ARIN
Okay. That's it. See that look on
your face. That's the gene I didn't
get.
Marin, now all pulled together, stands at the podium in front
of a packed house. If' you didn't know, you'd never guess.
MARIN
Good evening and welcome to Sotheby's and
this evening's sale of Impressionistic
and Modern Art. Bidders should know that
the auctioneer may open bidding on any
lot below the reserve by placing a bid on
behalf of the seller. Okay...Let's start
with Lot I, the Bonnard drawing. And
$5.000 starting with my bidders, $5000 is
bid, 5500, 6000, 6500 is mine, 7000
gentleman's bid, 7500 is here, 8000 on
the phone. . .
ON ERICA
in the back of the room, watching with pride and worry. She
slips out her cell, checks her messages. Her phone lights up
and tells her she has "0" Voice Mail.
A CLOCK ON THE WALL - IT'S 8:30
We are in ERICA'S EMPTY KITCHEN in The Hamptons and her phone
is RINGING.
ANGLE - A CELL PHONE
as A Man's HAND turns it off. We are:
Julian sits at a table, by himself, in a coat and tie,
tucking away his phone. The Waiter sympathetically approaches
the table.
JULIAN
Guess I got stood up.
WAITER
Would you like to order or...?
91.
JULIAN
Why not, I put. on the tie and
everything. And can you bring me
another. . .
(indicating his drink)
Julian takes a look at the menu, then looks away.
TWO DINNER PLATES ARE CARRIED THROUGH THE RESTAURANT
and as the CAMERA WIDENS we realize we are:
IN A CHIC CAFE IN MANHATTAN - LATER THAT NIGHT
Camera takes us to Erica, Marin, Dave and DAVE'S FIANCE, KRISTEN,
a combo of a hot tie and a young professional. Everyone has menus
and drinks. A Waiter delivers two new Martinis for Marin and
Erica. They both go right for them. Erica drinks too much too
fast.
D
AVE
(to Erica)
Thirsty?
ERICA
I've had a big week Dave, forgot how
these slip right down. I'm fine. So,
Kristen, where'd you go to...
(burps)
--medical school? Excuse me.
KRISTEN
University of Pennsylvania.
ERICA
I went to school in Philadelphia
too.
DAVE
Bryn Mawr girl.
KRISTEN
That's amazing. My Mom went to Bryn
Mawr . . .
MARIN
Wow. So not only are you marrying my father
but our mothers went to the same college.
Marin takes out a pack of cigarettes.
MARIN
Anyone mind?
KRISTEN
Actually I do.
92.
MARIN
Okay, I'll just..have one.
(lights up)
So, this isn't going badly so far
is it? I mean for a totally surreal
situation like this.
DAVE
Shall we order?
KRISTEN
Absolutely.
DAVE
(peruses menu)
Erica, do I like duck?
ERICA
Yes. It's rabbit you hate.
(to Kristen)
I'll give you a list of everything
he likes and dislikes.
DAVE
Let's let her figure some things
out on her own.
ERICA
I didn't mean those things, Dave.
She did go to medical school.
MARIN
(pointing to herself and
Kristen)
Hey, not in front of the kids.
ERICA
(polishing off her
Martini)
I will tell you this...Dave has one
truly great love in his life.
KRISTEN
Really? What's that?
ERICA
His balls.
DAVE
Okay, I forgot to mention she can't
drink hard liquor.
(to Marin)
Why did you order her a Martini?
E
93.
ERICA
What? It's not true? The man can not
watch TV or read without the hand down
the pants-- Here's my advice after 21
years I say who cares, they're his
balls,let him enjoy 'em.
MARIN
(chokes)
I think I swallowed my olive, whole.
Erica looks up and sees something that takes her breath away.
A COUPLE ZIGZAGGING AROUND TABLES
and headed in her direction. A sexy Young Thing followed by
her date -- no other than Harry. Harry stops to shake
someone's hand, holds his date around the waist. Suddenly,
the SOUND DROPS OUT of the restaurant as Harry and his Date
walk right by Erica's table in SLOW MOTION, not noticing her.
M
OVING IN ON ERICA
as the room comes alive again. Her eyes follow Harry as he is
seated only one table away, his back to Erica, his Date
facing her. Marin hasn't seen him. Erica tries her hardest to
act normal but apparently isn't.
MARIN
Mom, you okay?
ERICA
Yeah, fine.
Erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to Harry.
His Date is laughing at something Harry is saying. Harry
leans in to her, whispers something to her. She touches his
hand.
RICA
You know what? Maybe I need a little
air...
Erica rises; grabs her purse, almost bumps into a Waiter as
she passes Harry's table, knocks into someone's chair, a
glass breaks. Everyone turns to her, including Harry. She now
stands right at his table. He smiles up at her.
HARRY
Hey.
ERICA
Hello... Harry.
(to his Date)
Hello...
94.
Harry slowly climbs up the gorgeous staircase of his
Townhouse. Exhausted, he stops half way up, sits on a step,
takes out his cell.
HARRY
If you were my Dad...
He pulls his glasses out of his pocket, puts them on to dial.
Something feels odd, he takes off his glasses, looks at them,
they're not his -- they're Erica's. He puts them back on and
dials.
100.
ERICA'S VOICE
Hi. It's Erica. I'm not here so
leave a message.
He realizes he doesn't know what to say, hangs up, then looks
at her glasses.
HARRY
(grabbing his chest)
Ouch.
BLACK SCREEN
A LIGHT POPS ON and Erica ENTERS HER BEDROOM, crying. She
flops down on her bed, picks up her phone, grabs her glasses,
puts them on, doesn't realize they're Harry's. She dials.
Voice Mail tells her she has One Message. She sits up,
excited.
J
ULIAN'S VOICE
Erica, Hi, it's Julian. It's about
8:20, I'm in the restaurant...just
Wondering if you're...
Erica hangs up, starts crying again. She takes off her
glasses to wipe her eyes when she realizes she's holding
Harry's glasses. Just the sight of them makes her burst into
tears, the kind of tears that have been thirty years in the
making.
ERICA'S COMPUTER KEYBOARD - NIGHT
A tear lands on it. Erica, back in a turtleneck and wearing
Harry's glasses, starts writing at a breakneck pace, all the
while, tears flood her eyes.
MORNING - WAVES BREAKING ON THE SHORE
ERICA
wakes up. As soon as her eyes open, she bursts into tears.
While in the SHOWER, the crying never stops. While she EATS
BREAKFAST, a downpour. Running ON THE BEACH, she's wailing.
Back at the "COMPUTER, she's sobbing as her hands fly over
the keys. An actual boo hoo can be heard.
At NIGHT, laptop in bed, Erica writes, eating a
bagel, wearing
Harry's glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas,
FRENCH MUSIC plays
in the BG. At this point, she doesn't eVen" pay
attention to her
tears, just wipes and types when out of nowhere
she receives an
INSTANT MESSAGE from HARRY.
He writes: Do I hear French Music?
Shocked, she sits up, tries to fix her hair.
H
101.
Harry sits up in bed, staring at his laptop, wearing Erica's
glasses, a pair of pajamas and a three day growth. A
thermometer is propped in his mouth.
He writes: R U there?
She answers: Yes. Hello.
He writes: How are ya?
She writes: Great... as, she wipes her tears on her sleeve.
e writes:How's the writing going?
She answers: Pouring out of me now. Go figure.
E
He types: I miss y .. He stops, thinks before sending.
rica waits on her side. Nothing, is coming over.
Then, on his side, he receives: Actually just running out.
Take care...
Harry deletes the I miss y... and instead writes: U 2.
Erica slides down in her bed, wiped.
Harry takes out his thermometer. Feels lost. Looks at the
clock. It's 10:00 p.m.
Lowell lies in bed in pj's, WATCHING TV, smoking. Harry
arrives at his doorway in his pajamas. Lowell puts out his
cigarette, fans the smoke.
HARRY
Lowell, I'm goin' out.
LOWELL
(confused)
Okay. Don't forget to put some
clothes on.
HARRY
I mean, I should go out, shouldn't I?
Since .when don't I go out? Just cause
some Emergency Room Doctor tells me to
stay in bed, doesn't mean I have to turn
into a monk.
102.
LOWELL
Is there something you'd like me to
do for you, Mr. Langer?
HARRY
Well, no, just...well, what are you
doin'?
LOWELL
Watching Lucy.
HARRY
Would you hate making me something
to eat?
CLOSE - LUCY AND ETHEL ON TV
REVERSE - HARRY AND LOWELL
lying on top of the covers in Lowell's room, both eating
bowls of pasta, watching TV.
HARRY
Funny women are adorable, don't you
think?
LOWELL
I never really thought about it.
HARRY
Neither had I, but think about it.
Funny's a unique thing in a woman. It's
fun to be around.
LOWELL
There's some reason we've been
watching these two for 5O years.
HARRY
Exactly. It lasts. We're not
sittin' here watchin' Mamie Van
Doren reruns.
LOWELL
No we're not. You feeling okay?
HARRY
I don't think I've slept one night
since I've been home. Every little
ache and pain scares the shitout of
me...can't get a handle on my
emotional life, don't know what I
want, don't know if what I felt was
because I just had a heart attack
or was real. Plus, I feel needy. I
never used that word in my life.
103.
HARRY (CONT'D)
Lowell, have you ever seen me like
this? Be honest.
LOWELL
Nothing even close.
HARRY
That's right, buddy, I'm a mess.
And I'm no good at it.
(realizes something)
Those are very nice pajamas, by the
way. Did they used to be mine?
LOWELL
Yes but you gave them to me, you
said you never wore them.
HARRY
I know. But why would I do that?
They're so elegant. Nice piping...
LOWELL
Mr. Langer, you're always giving
away beautiful things.
HARRY
Awwwww... How did I get like this?
(eyes fluttering shut)
I'm gonna shut my eyes for a few
minutes. Keep Lucy on...
Harry nods off and Lowell TURNS OUT THE LIGHT.
A PARTY is in progress. It's loud. The place is crawling with
characters from the Hip Hop world. Harry winds his way down his
crowded STAIRCASE, Girls grabbing at him as he passes by. As hard
as he tries, he can't quite bring to life the guy he knew how to
be.
LOWELL
(as Harry passes)
H
aving fun?
HARRY
Not quite.
Harry makes his way down the stairs, through the crowded
entry and OUT THE FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE, Harry steps into the
QUIET STREET, looks up at his house and the party inside.
Erica sets the table for two. Zoe pokes her head in the door.
ZOE
I got you something great at the
farm stand.
J
106.
Zoe fully opens the door revealing Julian holding a bouquet
of fresh cut flowers.
JULIAN
These are for you to give me when
you apologize.
Candlelit. Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a
home cooked meal. The CAMERA does a 360 around the table,
their faces saying it all. The Women bask in Julian's warmth
as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks from Julian to
Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again.
Erica places coffee cups in the sink. Julian is next to her,
leaning against the counter, holding a glass of wine.
ERICA
Julian, I hope you know I'm
mortified by my behavior. I was
going to get in touch with you,
send you a note or something...
JULIAN
A note? That's a little chilly.
ERICA
I'm embarrassed. I just haven't
been myself lately. What can I say?
JULIAN
Just tell me you're sorry.
ERICA
I am sorry.
JULIAN
Then you could kiss me.
ERICA
Kiss you?
ulian nods.
ERICA
You'll forgive me if I kiss' you?
JULIAN
Think so.
Erica hesitates then gives him a peck of a kiss.
107.
JULIAN
No one on earth would forgive you
for that kiss
(places his wine glass on
the counter)
May I?
Erica nods as Julian takes her in his arms and gives her a
kiss that doesn't quit.
JULIAN
(still holding her,
whispers)
I forgive you.
Erica very distinctly begins to hear the BEATING of her own
heart.
DISSOLVE TO:
ERICA'S COMPUTER SCREEN - ANOTHER NIGHT
On it is written: The lights on the Eiffel Tower dim to black
as the music continues to play.
Erica sits back, still wearing Harry's glasses. Finished at
last. She notices an empty Kleenex box on her desk. She
tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right
in the trash can.
Julian sits on the sofa, shoes off, reading the first half of
the play. A fire burns in the fireplace. Erica approaches the
back of the sofa, holding the rest of the pages.
JULIAN
It's the best thing you've ever written.
ERICA
It is?
JULIAN
It's wonderful. It's sweet. It's smart.
It's funny.
Erica leans oyer the sofa, reading over his shoulder.
JULIAN
How great is it that I'm not
intimidated by your brilliance?
Erica gives him a small kiss of appreciation.
108.
JULIAN
Must we go through this every time?
Come here...
She leans into him and he kisses her fully and sweetly. She
holds onto the sofa for support.
CUT TO:
A PRETTY GIRL - WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE MARIN
eating lunch in Orso's, talking non-stop.
PRETTY GIRL
I'm totally excited about this audition.
It's such a great part. It's supporting
but she's a really funny character.
There's this totally hilarious scene
where she's dating this like chauvinist
older guy and just as they're about to do
it, the guy moans and she thinks he's
just really into her, right? Except he's
having a heart attack and she's like
creeped out and her mother, who basically
despises the guy, rushes in, gives him
CPR and saves his life.
REVERSE ON HARRY
choking on his lunch.
Auditions are in progress. On stage, AN ACTRESS reads for the
A
part of "The Sister".
CTRESS
Look, we're four sophisticated people.
Why can't we all stay for the weekend?
ON ERICA'S PROFILE
in the audience. She sits in a row by herself, listening.
Harry ENTERS HER FRAME, sitting directly behind her.
HARRY
I need to talk to you.
Erica freezes, horrified. Turns, sees him.
HARRY
Got a minute?
109.
BACKSTAGE
Erica and Harry stand in front of a BACKDROP OF THE BEACH.
HARRY
So your play's about us?
ERICA
No, it's about me.
HARRY
Am I in it?
ERICA
A guy like you is in it but he's
not you.
HARRY
What happens to this guy who's
..not me?
ERICA
Haven't totally decided. He can
live or he can die.
HARRY
What are you leaning towards?
ERICA
Death.
(Harry reacts)
It's funnier.
HARRY
He dies of a funny heart attack?
ERICA
He's sort of a schmuck who screwed
around with our heroine, so it
won't be too sad.
HARRY
Schmucks are people too you know. Death
doesn't seem a little harsh?
ERICA
I just went where the story took
me. It's a work of fiction, Harry.
Really...just stuff I made up.
STAGE MANAGER
(approaching)
Erica, we're ready to do the
hospital, 'Do You Take Viagra
scene... Should we wait for you?
110.
Erica nods, horrified.
HARRY
So I'm going to be the laughing stock of
Broadway.
ERICA
Harry, he's not you. He's a version
of the truth of you. So to speak.
STAGE MANAGER
Sorry to interrupt again but Dave wants
to know, when Henry says, "I love ya",
you want that to be 'Ya', not 'You',
right?
ERICA
Right.
We now HEAR Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose play throughout
the theater. The BEACH backing is 'raised and an EIFFEL TOWER
BACKING is lowered behind them. They both try to ignore the
music, but it's impossible.
E
RICA
Well, you look really nice. You
feeling all right?
As they stand in front of the Eiffel Tower backing, FAKE SNOW
FALLS from above...
HARRY
You know it isn't like I wanted to stop
seeing you. We could've carried on a fun
thing for awhile. Why is it you dames
want all or nothing?
ERICA
I don't know, we're just goofy when it
comes to love... Look, Harry, if it's all
right with you, I'd like to be friends
HARRY
I'm not ready to be your friend. How's
that?
ERICA
Fine. I understand.
HARRY
Anyway, do you actually buy that horse
shit.. .that men and women can be friends
once they've had sex?
111.
ERICA
I'm friends with my ex-husband, but then
again, we didn't just have sex.
HARRY
We didn't just have sex either.
ERICA
Then what was it? Love to know.
HARRY
Can I e-mail it to you when I figure it
out?
(laughs)
This is perfect. I have given the `Can't
We Be friends' speech for 40 years. I
think I invented the 'Can't We Be
Friends' speech. But you know what,now I
get why they never went for it. You dames
got one thing right. Sometimes sex does
change everything. Call me crazy, but I
just don't see us out on the town, being
pals, having dinner, 'cause I'd bet you
anything, at some point, one of us will
have very unfriend like thoughts about
the other then pass the bread becomes
anything but pass the bread. You get what
I'm saying?
ERICA
You don't want to be friends.
HARRY
Not "don't". Can't. Can't be friends.
Doesn't work that way.
(tries to calm down)
Okay, I'm moving into another phase of
this thing. I'm mad at you.
(realizes)
It almost feels good.
ERICA
I think I'm mad at you too.
HARRY
Excellent. 'Cause I don't like
thinking about you so much and
worrying about how you are and if I
ruined your life or...
ERICA
-- You've worried about me?
HARRY
Yes honey, the schmuck who deserves to
die, worries about you.
112.
HARRY(cont'd)
Sometimes worrying about you feels like a
full time job.
ERICA
Well, doll, I'm doing fine. So you don't
have to work that shift anymore.
Again, The Stage Manager...
STAGE MANAGER
Erica, they want you to take a look at
the costumes for the dancing Henry's.
These gonna work for you?
Harry and Erica TURN and SEE a CHORUS LINE of BALDING 60 YEAR
OLD MEN IN HOSPITAL GOWNS AND SOCKS.
Harry is wheeled through the ER with the gurney. Dr. Martinez
runs along with the gurney.
DR. MARTINEZ
Mr. Langer... Back so soon.
HARRY
This is it, I'm dyin', I've had 20
minutes of severe chest pain,
nausea, shortness of breath, blood
pressure's gotta be 170 over 100.
(sticks out his arm)
Give me the nitrate, I didn't take
viagra.
(rips open his shirt)
Plug me in to the EKG, I need an
aspirin, I'm taking 2 beta
blockers, blood thinner, Lipitor,
Procardia and if I were you, I'd be
pounding my chest. Ow!
MALE NURSE
You're a doctor, huh?
HARRY
Just a very sick man.
CLOSE - THE PAPER TAPE FROM HARRY'S EKG
Dr. Martinez reads it.
DR. MARTINEZ
Mr. Langer, your diagnosis although
fascinating, was entirely
incorrect.
HARRY
That's impossible.
DR. MARTINEZ
Your realize a severe anxiety attack can
masquerade as a heart attack.
HARRY
So I'm nuts? Perfect! The one thing
I'm not taking pills for.
115.
DR. MARTINEZ
If you don't want ,to end up in here
every week, I suggest you do whatever it
takes to decompress. Try something with
me, okay?
(takes his pulse)
Close your eyes...now give yourself a
visual image of something that gives you
a feeling of peace and serenity.
HARRY
I don't know. A hammock...
DR. MATINEZ
Okay, good...what else..?
HARRY
Palm trees...clear blue water...
We hear the SOUND OF LAPPING WATER, SEA GULLS. . . .
DR. MARTINEZ
Anybody there with you?
HARRY
Yes. Beautiful women...in thongs...
DR. MARTINEZ
(disgusted) Okay. What else do you
see, feel, taste...
HARRY
A margarita...a Cuban cigar.
..miles of soft beach.. .
DR. MARTINEZ
Keep going...you're doing great...
And as Harry keeps listing things, Camera MOVES IN ON HIM as
the STEEL BAND gets LOUDER AND LOUDER.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE WORDS. . .
SIX MONTHS LATER
FALLING SNOW FILLS THE FRAME
Boom down to see the THEATER MARQUEE of Erica's play on
Broadway. On the Marquee are raves from critics, "****", and
a banner that brags, "Sold Out!".
C
AMERA CONTINUES DOWN to street level. Couples walk by,
bundled up against the cold. Harry ENTERS FRAME.
116.
He looks different. He has a beard and has lost some weight:
And in his eyes, a calm we haven't seen before. He pauses in
front of the theater -- loo~s at the PUBLICITY PHOTOS. He
SEES Henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting
"Emily" and her Sister. He sees ANOTHER PHOTO of The Dancing
Henrys kicking up their legs like Rockettes. Then, finally, A
PHOTO of Henry and Emily in bed, both wearing glasses. Harry
OPENS THE DOOR TO THE THEATER, steps inside and listens,
hearing Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose, then, the audience
breaks out in LAUGHTER. Harry smiles to himself.
The elevator opens. Harry steps out, looks around for an
apartment number, finds it, rings the bell and clears his
throat. The door quickly OPENS and we see MARIN. She looks
relaxed and happy to see him.
MARIN
I couldn't believe you were calling from
downstairs.
(hugs him)
So great to see you.
HARRY
You couldn't look better.
MARIN
Thank you. Come on in.
HARRY
No, no, I just wanted to stop by and say
hi and tell you I'm sorry if I ever did
anything to you that wasn't on the up and
up or...
MARIN
What do you mean? You were great to me.
HARRY
I was?
MARIN
Always.
HARRY
That's refreshing. Good. Well, I don't
know what you've done to yourself but you
look absolutely radiant.
MARIN
I'm three months pregnant, that might
have something to do with it.
117.
HARRY,
Really? Who's ..the, lucky guy?
MARIN
My husband, hold on, he really wants to
meet you.
(calls)
Danny...
A Solid Citizen of a Guy joins Marin, loosened tie,
glasses...
MARIN
Harry Langer, my husband, Danny Yellin.
DANNY
(shaking Harry's hand)
I've heard so much about you...
HARRY
I bet.. .
DANNY
Yeah, with Hthe play and all...
ARRY
I'm famous,huh?
MARIN
Just to us. In every interview my
Mom does, she always says she made
you up.
HARRY
So the guy in the play, he doesn't
make it, does he?
DANNY
He basically dies at the end of the
second act, but it's very funny.
(as if that's some
consolation)
HARRY
Was hopin' she'd give me a
reprieve, but...
MARIN
Yeah, well...
HARRY
Yeah. Okay...Best of luck, kids...
Marin is stumped by this little visit. Harry heads toward the
elevator, pushes the button, then turns back.
118.
HARRY
How is she?
MARIN
She's. . .
(Harry waits)
Really good.
Up to her old
tricks.
Learning Italian, remodeling her apartment in the city.
HARRY
Now if I wanted to see her...how
would that go over?
MARIN
(encouragingly)
Only one way to find out, except
she's out of town right now.
HARRY
Oh yeah? Where is she?
MARIN
Paris. She left two days ago, for
her birthday. But she'll be back
next week...
The Elevator arrives. Harry salutes his goodbye and steps
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR. He turns, FACES CAMERA.
HARRY
Paris...
ANOTHER ELEVATOR.OPENS
And a clean shaven, dapper looking Harry steps off, cashmere
coat, gorgeous scarf. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM out of the elevator
and through a BEAUTIFUL LOBBY OF A HOTEL then right onto THE
STREET. CAMERA does a 360 and we catch glimpses of PARIS AT
NIGHT. CAMERA SETTLES ON HARRY just as the LIGHTS OF THE
EIFFEL TOWER POP ON, sending a flood of golden lights high
into the night sky directly behind him.
HARRY
Showtirne.
Erica sits alone at a table in the back of the room, drinking
a glass of wine. She looks vibrant. She glances up from her
drink and sees what looks like Harry making his way around
the tables. She leans to the side for a better look, to make
sure it's him. It is him and he's corning right toward her.
Her stomach sinks, her mind races... and before she can come
up with a single thought that makes any sense -- there he is.
119.
HARRY
(proud of himself)
I knew you'd be here.
ERICA
You did?
HARRY
I've come a long way to see you,
Erica.
ERICA
You mean we're not bumping into
each other..? You came here to see
me?
HARRY
Yes, I did.
(she seems to shiver)
I'm aware it was a bold move, one
of those impulses that grabs you,'
but...so far, we're okay; right?
ERICA
Well, uh, I mean, I'm just...
HARRY
I'll take that as a 'Yes'.
Harry takes off his coat and scarf, hangs them on a hook.
ERICA
You want a glass of wine or
something?
HARRY
I was just gonna give you a kiss
hello.
ERICA
Oh, Okay.
Neither is sure where to go. Cheek? Lips? He lands on her
chin. .Not what he wanted, but he takes a seat across from
her. She looks at him - utterly speechless.
HARRY
I remember you said if we still
know each other we should go to
Paris for our birthdays, well, we
still know each other..".
ERICA
That's true, but, Harry, I haven't
heard from you in six months.
120.
HARRY
I know but I've certainly been thinking
about you. There's a lot I have to say.
First thing is... I'm not mad at you
anymore.
ERICA
Good, 'cause I'm not mad at you
anymore either.
HARRY
That's a relief...since I did come all
the way to France and everything. And...
Happy Birthday.
ERICA
(afraid of everything he
could possibly say)
Thank you.
HARRY
And congratulations on your amazing
success...
ERICA
It's been quite a ride. Funny, I thought
maybe I'd hear from you when it opened.
Where've you been?
HARRY
After I saw you in the theater that
afternoon, I had another "episode...
ERICA
Oh, I'm sorry.
HARRY
I was actually okay, but I was sure I was
dying and the doctor in the ER said I needed
to decompress. So I did. I walked out of
there and changed my life, sold most of my
businesses, packed my bags and moved to an
island in the Caribbean.
E
RICA
That's where you've been all this
time? In the Caribbean?
HARRY
Actually...No.
HARRY
It took me six months to find them
all. I visited 18 different states
but I came the furthest to see you.
A HAND lands on his shoulder and he HEARS:
A MAN'S VOICE
I don't believe it.
Harry looks up and sees handsome young Julian in a beret.
Harry looks to Erica, instantly deflated..
HARRY
Me either.
Harry stands. The two Men hug, then Julian squeezes in next
to Erica. Harry slowly takes his seat across from them.
ERICA
I should have told you he was coming, but
I was so engrossed in your story.
JULIAN
What story..?
HARRY
Oh, maybe another time. ..So...
(looks from Erica to
Julian, it all dawns on
him)
I guess I should've seen your play, then
I would've Jknown how this ended.
ULIAN
Yeah, big twist, huh? So what are
you doing over here, man?
HARRY
Just a uh, vacation...never been to Paris
in January...
JULIAN
It's amazing to run into you. You look
wonderful.
124.
ERICA
You do.
HARRY
Haven't been on a gurney in six months so
that's somethin'...
JULIAN
Well, I've just been to every store
in the city, this woman is
impossible to buy for... But I
think I finally found the right
gift.
He puts what can only be a RING BOX on the table between
Erica and Harry.
JULIAN
Happy Birthday baby.
He kisses her. Harry watches, dying.
ERICA
(reaching for it)
I'll open it later...
Harry rises, reaches for his coat.
HARRY
No, no, you know what, I'll let you
two celebrate...
ERICA
Harry, stay.
HARRY
I can't really.
JULIAN
Why? You have somewhere to go?
DISSOLVE TO:
THE WAITER POURING THE END OF A WINE BOTTLE
Everyone at the table is laughing, mid-meal. Julian is doing
the talking as well as laughing. Harry laughs along, trying
to be an approving part of their romance but he's totally
faking it.
THREE GLASSES OF BRANDY ARE SERVED - A LITTLE LATER
JULIAN
-- To the forces of destiny that
brought us together tonight.
125.
Erica lights a cigarette.
JULIAN
What are you doing, you don't
smoke?
ERICA
I'm in Paris, the second hand smoke
will kill you anyway...
JULIAN
She's very brilliant, but the woman
can not hold her liquor.
Julian puts his arm around her, pulls her close.
ERICA
I like that about me.
BOTH GUYS
Me too.
The Guys exchange looks.
ERICA
Now, if I were writing this, this
is where I'd write, 'an awkward
moment' .
HARRY
Honey, if you were writing this,
I'd be dead.
Erica laughs.
HARRY
Never fails to amuse her.
The Waiter drops the check on the table. Harry takes it.
JULIAN
No, Harry, please, let us...
HARRY
No, no, I insist. I crashed your
party.
(to Erica)
At least let me buy you dinner on
your birthday...
(squints at his watch
shows it to Erica)
What time does that say?
ERICA
(squints)
I have no idea...
126.
HARRY
(feels around)
Wait,' I have my. . .
ERICA
(reaching into her purse)
Me too...
They each take out EACH OTHER'S GLASSES and put them on.
Erica points to Harry wearing her glasses and laughs.
HARRY
You think you look so handsome in
mine?
ERICA
You know how long I've been looking
for those?
HARRY
Yes I do.
Harry hands Erica her glasses. She hesitates. He snaps,
gesturing for his to be turned over. She hands them to him.
Julian watches all this, sobered by their chemistry.
H
ARRY
(tucking away his glasses)
Once again...closure.
(reads his watch)
So it's only 5 in the afternoon in
New York. What do they do around
here for fun?
Camera finds the three of them sitting at a small table. The
place is dark, loud, crowded and young. They're all drinking
champagne. The air is strained.
BOTH GUYS
(at the same time)
Want to dance?
Harry gestures for Julian to have the first dance. Julian
takes Erica's hand and leads her to the dance floor. Harry
watches them slip through the crowd. Erica turns back, Harry
waves. Julian takes Erica in his arms, it's clear she's
comfortable in his embrace. None of .this is lost on Harry
and as he watches, the smile on his face more than fades, it
evaporates and everything inside him begins to hurt.
ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR
Erica and Julian -- they're sexy together.
127.
ANGLE - THE TABLE
Harry is gone.
The same restaurant from the first scene of the film - One
Year Later. Harry ENTERS FRAME, just like he did before.
" HARRY
Langer, party of four.. .and a
half.
The Maitre'D snaps to attention and leads Harry, Erica,
Marin, holding her Baby Girl, and her husband Danny through
the crowded restaurant. The Baby fusses and reaches out to
Harry who takes her in his arms and proudly parades her
through this swanky crowd to a round table in the center of
the room. Harry beams at the prize in his arms as he sits
with his family for a Sunday dinner.
