      The kind of place that has happy hour from 6 to 10 a.m..  
      Find RAYLAN GIVENS, already in the bag, posted up at the near-
      empty bar.  He does not look good.

      At the far end, TWO DRUNKS both mid-30s, are drinking their 
        unemployment checks away and loving it.

                                  DRUNK #1
                    Here s to being laid off.

                                  DRUNK #2
                    Amen brother.  To the good life.

      They cheers, drink, laughing, just generally being loud and 
      obnoxious.

      Raylan, trying to ignore them, swallows the last of his neat 
      bourbon.  The BARTENDER notices, grabs the bottle.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Assumin  you re not gonna stop now.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Can t think of one good reason why 
                    I would.

      The Bartender grabs the bottle, pours Raylan a generous 
      measure into the same glass.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Don t believe I ve seen you in here 
                    before.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Taking time off of work.  Thought 
                    I d experience some local color.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Well, happy to have you.  Any man 
                    drinks bourbon neat is alright by 
                    me.

      Down the bar, one of the DRUNKS holds up his empty glass:


                                                                              (CONTINUED)            EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    2.

                                  DRUNK #1
                    Nurse?  Little help?

      Raylan and the Bartender both take them in.  The Bartender 
      good naturedly.  Raylan not so much.

      As the Bartender goes off to refill the DRUNKS, Raylan takes 
      a pull of the whiskey.  Extracts his PHONE.  Opens it, 
      scrolls through the numbers, stops on AVA S.  He s drunk, 
      hurt, wants nothing more than to crawl in bed with her, but 
      knows it s the last thing he should do.  He s staring, 
        considering, when he hears --

                                  DRUNK #1 (CONT D)
                     Cause she s a worthless whore!

      Raylan looks up.  Watches the Drunks laugh.  Maybe we start a 
      SLOW PUSH towards them for this dialogue.

                                  DRUNK #1 (CONT D)
                    All any of  em really are, you 
                    think about it.  I mean, my latest 
                    side dish ain t no more than a 
                    lonely house wife.  I show up, make 
                    her squeal, and she thinks I m 
                    Christ himself for it.

                                  DRUNK #2
                    This the one with them kids?

                                  DRUNK #1
                    Hell yeah... how do you think I 
                    knew she liked to screw?

      They re laughing pretty hard now...

                                  DRUNK #2
                    Not to mention, you get bored with 
                    her, you can always play with them!

      This sends them into hysterics, slapping the bar, dying 
      laughing.  Raylan s had it.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hey.  Jackals.
                          (the Drunks turn, look)
                    You mind keeping it down?

                                  DRUNK #1
                    Why would we do that?

                     Cause I didn t order assholes with 
                    my whiskey.

      The drunks take this in, then:

                                  DRUNK #1
                    What d you say?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Any woman that s merciful enough to 
                    take you into her bed deserves 
                    better than to be insulted behind 
                    her back.  So why don t you stop 
                    trying to impress your friend, 
                    drink your drink, and we ll be just 
                    fine.

                                  DRUNK #2
                    You seem to be harborin  a bit of 
                    hostility there, brother.

      Raylan stares, his eyes burning with anger and alcohol.

                                  RAYLAN
                    So I ve been told.

                                  DRUNK #1
                    Last I checked this a free country.  
                    You don t like what s bein  said, 
                    you can piss off.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m meeting someone here.

                                  DRUNK #1
                    I really don t give a shit.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Then I suppose we re at an impasse.

                                  DRUNK #1
                    Yes I suppose we are.

                                  BARTENDER
                          (amiably)
                    Hey, no need for this.  Why don t 
                    you all just take a calm breath, 
                    enjoy a round on the house?

      But as the Bartender goes to fetch the bottle, the Drunks and 
      Raylan haven t stopped staring each other down.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)            EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    4.

                    There s two of us, only one of you.  
                    You like those odds?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m good if you are.

      The Drunks almost smile, start to get off their chairs, same 
      as Raylan, and we CUT TO --


      Place is a mess.  Bed unmade.  Bottles and clothes strewn 
      about.  Trash overflowing.  Raylan enters, sits on the bed, 
      starts to undress.

                                  WINONA
                    Maid refusing to clean up after 
                    you?

                                  RAYLAN
                      Apparently.

                                  WINONA
                    Well I know how she feels.

      Winona moves to the BATHROOM, WETS A WASHCLOTH.  Clocks Ava s 
      HAIR CLIP sitting on the counter.  A pang of jealousy.

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    I ran into Art, at the courthouse.  
                    He told me what happened.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What happened is I m on vacation.

                    That s funny.  He said you were on 
                      indefinite suspension.

      Winona re-enters, washcloth in hand, goes to Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That why you wanted to meet?  So 
                    you could give me a hard time?

                    No, actually, it s not.

      Winona starts to clean Raylan up, dabbing his bloody face 
      with the washcloth.  It s painful.

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    Wynn Duffy came to see me.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Wynn Duffy?  How do I know that 
                    name?

                                  WINONA
                    It was on the list I pulled from 
                    Gary s email.
                          (Raylan takes this in)
                    I came home, found Duffy sitting at 
                    my kitchen table.

                                  RAYLAN
                    He broke in?

                                  WINONA
                    Well, he came in.  Can t say I saw 
                    anything broken.

                                  RAYLAN
                    He threaten you?

                                  WINONA
                    Not directly.  Said he was a 
                    security consultant, that Gary d 
                    hired him.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What d Gary say?

                                  WINONA
                    Played dumb, accused me of being a 
                    snoop.  Also mentioned that you 
                    went to see him, put some fear into 
                    him.

      Raylan stops.  Takes this in.

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    Why d you go to Gary if the names 
                    on that list came up clean?

                                  RAYLAN
                    We were married six years, Winona, 
                    and in that time your instinct 
                    wasn t often wrong.  Those names 
                    may have come up clean, but if you 
                    think something s up then I m 
                    inclined to believe you.  So whatta 
                    you think s going on with your 
                    husband?

      Winona considers it.  Then, she comes clean:

                                  WINONA
                    Gary has this development project.  
                    Some land he bought a while back.  
                    If he s in trouble, my guess is it 
                    has to do with that.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Tough time to be developing...

      Raylan s wheels are turning.  Definitely not good.

                                  WINONA
                    If you re thinking about going back 
                    to Gary, please don t.  My home 
                    life is strained enough without my 
                      ex-husband badgering my current 
                    husband.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Not gonna do that.  But I was 
                    thinking about stopping by Wynn 
                    Duffy s place for a chat.

                                  WINONA
                    A chat, huh?

                                  RAYLAN
                    On vacation, remember?  Means no 
                    badge, no gun.

                                  WINONA
                    And no hat.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (then, depressed)
                    Don t worry, I ll be good.







                                                                              (CONTINUED)            EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    9.

      Having finished cleaning his face up, Winona proceeds to help 
      Raylan out of his shirt.  He groans and grimaces, as we see 
      the BRUISING all over his chest and back.

                                  WINONA
                    Little old to be fighting aren t 
                    you?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Certainly too old to be losing.

      Raylan painfully lays down.  Winona rolls some covers over 
      him.  Is essentially putting him to bed.

                                  WINONA
                    Thank you, Raylan.  You re a good 
                    man.

      Raylan nods.  Winona now rises, grabs her purse, and heads 
      out.  Once she s gone:

                                  RAYLAN
                      Apparently not good enough.

      Off Raylan, alone in his dirty motel room...


      Toby extracts a couple of BEERS from the fridge, pops the 
      tops, hands one to Gary.

      Through the BACK WINDOWS Gary watches the GIRLS playing under 
      Amanda s watchful gaze.

                                  TOBY
                    Figured we d leave the cheese and 
                    wine for Amanda s book club.

      They smile, cheers, drink.

                                  GARY
                    Gotta admit, back at UK when you 
                    were T-Bone Griffin, I never 
                    thought I d see the day when you 
                    had the wife, the kids, the yard.

                                  TOBY
                    Well, it ain t all rainbows and 
                    stardust, but I come a long way 
                    from T-Bone, that s for sure.

      Gary takes this in.  He s thinking about Winona.  Their 
      future, if they even have one.  He snaps out of it.  Catches 
      sight of a LARGE RING on Toby s finger.

                                  GARY
                    Let me see that thing again...

      Toby takes off the ring, smiles.

                                  TOBY
                    Amanda gives me shit for wearing 
                    it... but I m not ready to stick 
                     er in a drawer just yet.

      Toby hands the ring to Gary.  He admires it, and we now 
      realize we re looking at a COWBOYS SUPER BOWL RING.

                                  TOBY (CONT D)
                    Most frustrating day of my life 
                    watching that game in street 
                    clothes.

                                  GARY
                    How is the knee?

      Gary hands Toby back the ring.  He puts it back on.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    12.

                    Fine for playing with the kids.
                          (clearly not over it)
                    Hey, I had a good run, got my ring.

                                  GARY
                          (teasing)
                    And now you got wine and cheese in 
                    the fridge.

                                  TOBY
                    Now I got wine and cheese in the 
                    fridge.  Ain t that some shit?

      They share a smile.  Toby just shakes his head, drinks.

                                  GARY
                    Listen, Toby, good as it is to see 
                    you, this isn t just a social call.

                                  TOBY
                    Uh oh.  You haven t gone all 
                    Jehovah s witness on me have you?

                                  GARY
                    Actually, I have an investment 
                      opportunity for you.  A shopping 
                    center we re gonna break ground on 
                    in the spring.  We re looking for 
                      additional financing, and if you 
                    haven t blown all that NFL money on 
                    strippers and blow, I ve got some 
                    stuff out in the car I d love to 
                    show you.

      Toby eyes Gary, this guy he knew before Gary even knew 
      himself.

                                  TOBY
                    Remember when you nailed Debbie 
                    Reynolds in my bed?
                          (Gary sheepishly does)
                    I came back to the dorm after 
                    practice, and you had this look on 
                    your face, and I knew right away 
                    you d messed up.
                          (then)
                    What s going on Gary?  You screw a 
                    girl in another man s bed or what?

      Gary quiets.  A beat.  Then:




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    13.

                                  GARY
                      Everything was booming.  Through 
                    the roof.  Couldn t sell houses 
                    fast enough.  This land came up, I 
                    did my homework, the numbers looked 
                    good...

                                  TOBY
                    And then the bottom dropped out.

                                  GARY
                    I got overextended.  Took money 
                    from people I shouldn t have.  I m 
                    in a tough spot, Toby.

                                  TOBY
                    How tough?  Six figures?

                                  GARY
                    Almost seven.

      Toby takes this in.  No joke.  He considers, then:

                                  TOBY
                    Look, straight up, I got nothing to 
                    give you.  I mean I can pay my 
                    mortgage, but between the first 
                    wife, the current wife, the two 
                    kids and this economy, I gotta look 
                    out for my own, know what I sayin ?

                                  GARY
                    Yeah, yeah, I hear you.  It s okay.  
                    I ll figure something out.

      But Toby knows Gary must be desperate if he s come to him.

                                  TOBY
                    The guys you owe, they pressuring 
                    you?

                                  GARY
                    Came to my house when I wasn t 
                    home, threatened my wife.  I 
                    just... I don t know what they re 
                    capable of.

                                  TOBY
                    Look, I m no heavy, you know that.  
                    But I can cut an imposing figure, 
                    still got my thousand yard stare. 
                    You need to push back a little, buy 
                    yourself some time, I got you.

                          (surprised but grateful)
                      I appreciate the offer, but that s 
                    not why I came over here --

                                  TOBY
                    I know that.  But the truth Gary, 
                    is I miss being the baddest dude on 
                    that field.  Be nice to go in, 
                    throw my weight around, get to be 
                    mean again.  When do I get a chance 
                    to be the T-Bone anymore?

                    Book club?

      Toby smiles.  Gary does too, for the moment, feeling better.


      Raylan enters.  TWO MEN are there.  One we recognize as WYNN 
      DUFFY, the  security expert  who approached Winona in Ep. 
      106.  He sits behind a desk.  The other is BILLY MAC, wiry 
      and tattooed, seated on a couch.  The two of them are 
      anything but physically intimidating, yet still mighty 
      creepy; cold, watchful eyes.

      They both stare at Raylan.  His beaten face.  Lots of sizing 
      up being done right now, not a word spoken.

                                  RAYLAN
                      Afternoon.

                                  DUFFY
                      Afternoon.  Can we help you?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I sure hope so.  I was told you 
                    gentlemen handle security, and as 
                    you can see, I m in need of some.

      Raylan gestures to his beaten face.  Duffy and Billy Mac 
      exchange a quick glance.  Consider it.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    15.

      CONTINUED:1111

                                  DUFFY
                    We can discuss that.  But first I 
                    need to know who you are, and who 
                    referred you.

      Raylan considers.  Looks to Billy, coiled and quiet.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Name s Ray.  I was referred by a 
                    friend of mine.  Gary Hawkins?

      This sets alarm bells ringing.  Duffy and Billy Mac aren t 
      sure what to make of this.  Duffy now recedes a bit.

                                  DUFFY
                     Fraid you ve been misinformed.  
                    Thank you for your interest.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Not much of a sales pitch...

      The joke dies.  Duffy just stares, cool as a Wisconsin 
      winter.  Billy s getting antsy.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    What is it you two really do here?  
                     Cause I don t see much in the way 
                    of a security business.  In fact, I 
                    don t see anything but lead paint 
                    and dust mites.*

      Billy Mac now gets up.*

                                  BILLY
                    Man asked you to leave.  Suggest 
                    that s what you do.

                                    RAYLAN*
                    I already took one beating, and I m *
                    not really looking to take another *
                    one.  All I want to know is how you *
                    two are involved with Gary Hawkins.*

                                  DUFFY*
                    If you re really that curious, why *
                    don t you just ask Gary?*

                                    RAYLAN*
                    I tried that.  He was reluctant to *
                    talk about it.*
                                                                                              *

                                  DUFFY*
                    Well then, maybe that s an answer *
                    in itself, huh Ray?*

                                    RAYLAN*
                    Maybe it is.*

                                  DUFFY*
                    Time to go now.*

                    I m going to leave, but I m going *
                    to say this first, and then *
                    hopefully none of us will ever have *
                    to see each other again.  Whatever *
                    issue the two of you have with Gary *
                    Hawkins, I can guarantee you his *
                    wife has nothing to do with it, and 
                    never has.  So from here on, either *
                    one of you approaches Winona 
                    Hawkins because of Gary s trouble, 
                    I will come back here and up-end 
                    your entire existence, that *
                      understood?*

                                  DUFFY*
                    Okay, Ray.  Your point is well *
                    stated.

      Raylan turns, and is out.  Billy and Duffy watch him go to 
      the Towncar through the front windows.

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    Follow him.  I want to know who he 
                    is, how he s connected to Gary and 
                    Winona, and then I want him put in 
                    the ground.

      Off Billy, nodding, heading OUT after Raylan...

                                                                              BLACK.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Duffy, at his desk, on SPEAKER PHONE.  As Duffy speaks, he 
      watches a CAR pull into the lot, park.  (We might recognize 
      it as GARY S.)

                                  ARNETT (V.O.)
                    These aren t the old days, Duffy.  
                    These contracts are legitimate.

                                  DUFFY
                      I understand that, and you know I 
                    have your best interests at heart, 
                    but a federal Marshal walked into 
                    this office and threatened me.

      Then over the speaker phone, hear what sounds like KNOCKING.

                                  ARNETT (V.O.)
                    Hold on, Duffy.
                          (then, to person knocking)
                    Yeah?

      Faint sound of a door opening.  Hear a FAINT WOMAN S VOICE.

                                  ARNETT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                          (muffled, to woman)
                    Baby, come on over here and we ll 
                    take care of it.
                          (rustling sounds, then)
                    Duffy, you still there?

                                  DUFFY
                    What would you like to do?

                                  ARNETT (V.O.)
                    Go to Gary.  Remind him clearly and 
                    simply of his obligations...
                          (then, not to Duffy)
                    Ah, Goddamn... Easy girl, ain t a 
                    contest, know what I mean?
                          (to Duffy)
                    Sorry Duffy, what was I saying?

                    Right.  Remind him and I m sure 
                    he ll see things our way.

      Arnett then BREATHES IN SHARPLY as, through the windows Duffy 
      watches Gary and Toby exit the car.

                                  DUFFY
                    Arnett, you on speaker?

                                  ARNETT (V.O.)
                    Nah.  Hate speaker.  Why?

                                  DUFFY
                    Can I ask you something?

                                  ARNETT (V.O.)
                    Shoot.

                                  DUFFY
                    You getting a blow job in your 
                    office right now?

                                  ARNETT (V.O.)
                          (hesitates, then)
                    It be weird if I was?

      Gary and Toby are now approaching Duffy s office door.

                                  DUFFY
                    I m gonna call you back.

      Duffy hangs up as Gary and Toby ENTER THE OFFICE.

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    Mr. Hawkins.  I was just talking 
                    about you.  And you ve brought a 
                    friend.

                                  GARY
                    Duffy.  How are you?

                                  DUFFY
                    I m okay.  Busy in here today.  An 
                      acquaintance of yours stopped by a 
                    bit ago.  Ray?  Didn t seem to care 
                    much about you, but was very 
                      protective of your lovely wife...

                                  GARY
                    Raylan came here?

                    Sure did.  Fancies himself kind of 
                    a tough guy, doesn t he?  I gotta 
                    tell you Gary, all I want is the 
                    money; these visits are growing 
                    pretty tiresome.

                                  GARY
                    Well that s what I came to discuss.  
                      I appreciate our arrangement, and 
                    have every intention of holding up 
                    my end, but it seems to me Arnett 
                    made an investment.

                    And an investment, I don t have to 
                    tell you, comes with certain risk.

                                  DUFFY
                            (nonplussed, to Toby)
                    Do we know each other?  You look 
                    awfully familiar...

                                  TOBY
                    Why don t you worry less about me, 
                    more about what my man is saying.

                                  DUFFY
                    Okay, sure.  Gary?  You were 
                    saying?

                                  GARY
                    Your boss s money is tied up in the 
                    property, and that property isn t 
                    worth half of what it once was.

                                  DUFFY
                    You think selling now would be a 
                    poor business decision.

                                  GARY
                    See, that s right.  The market is 
                    starting to come back.  We wait a 
                    few years, get this construction 
                    underway, we ll be rolling.

                                  DUFFY
                    Rolling, huh?
                          (then, to Toby)
                    This really is driving me crazy.  
                    Sure we haven t met?

                          (to Toby)
                    I don t think that s necessary --

                          (ignoring Gary)
                    You tell your boss his money is 
                      unavailable.  That simple.  He 
                    wants to talk to Gary about that he 
                    can pick up the phone and dial.  In 
                    the meantime, you will not harass 
                    this man or his wife again, you 
                      understand?

                    That hardly seems fair.  I was very 
                    nice to Gary s wife.

      Toby begins to start towards Duffy, but Gary intervenes, 
      trying to keep peace.

                                  GARY
                    All I m saying is, I could probably 
                    get your boss s money tomorrow if 
                    he really wants it --

                                  TOBY
                    No, he can t, and he ain t gonna --

                                  GARY
                    Or --
                          (cutting Toby off)
                    Or I can get him double his money 
                    in 24 months.

      Duffy acts is if he s considering it.  Then gets up, goes to 
      Toby, who stands his ground, eyes Singletary crazy.

                                  DUFFY
                    Listen, I don t know how you re 
                      associated with Mr. Hawkins, or 
                    why, but I m going to give you this 
                    chance to extricate yourself from 
                    his predicament before you go 
                    getting yourself involved in 
                    something that, frankly, you don t 
                    want to be involved in.

                                  TOBY
                    You don t back up right now and 
                    create some space, I m gonna paint 
                    these walls with your shit.

      Gary looks at Toby:  WTF does that even mean?  Duffy though, 
      backs off.  If that s how they want it, fine.

                                  DUFFY
                    I ll go to Arnett, tell him 
                      everything you just told me.

                                  TOBY
                    Damn right you will.  Make him 
                      understand.

      Toby turns to leave.  Gary, to Duffy, as if apologizing:




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    21.

                    Gary!  Nothing to consider.  We re 
                    leaving.

      Off Toby and Gary, heading out.  Toby feeling great; Gary 
      pretty sure things are now worse than when they started; and 
      Duffy, shaking his head, knowing Arnett isn t going to be 
      happy about this one bit...

      I/E. RAYLAN S TOWNCAR - OUTSIDE DIVE BAR - DAY1313

      Raylan parks his car in front of the dive bar.  In his 
      REARVIEW MIRROR he watches a CAR park on the far side of the 
      street, Billy Mac at the wheel.  Raylan clocks him.  
      Considers.  Extracts his phone.  Dials.  Two rings, then --


      TIM, at his desk, answers the call.

      Off Raylan, hanging up as he exits his car, approaching...


      Raylan enters.  Again, the bar is nearly empty.  The men who 
      beat him up are not there.  Raylan approaches the Bartender 
      who helped him out.  The bartender sees him coming, greets 
      him with friendly apprehension.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Glad to see you re up and around.  
                    Wasn t sure how bad they got to 
                    you.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Nothing that won t heal.

                                  BARTENDER
                    All the same, maybe it s best if 
                    you don t saddle up here today.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Listen, I don t want to cause 
                    trouble, don t even want to get 
                    back at those men, Lord knows I was 
                    asking for trouble.  But I had a 
                    hat on that I ve grown pretty fond 
                    of, and I d like to have it back.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Well, we don t have much of a lost 
                    and found, but I didn t find your 
                    hat.

      Raylan extracts his wallet, removes a 20 dollar bill and his 
      CARD, lays them down on the bar.

                                  RAYLAN
                    When those men come in again, or if 
                    my hat turns up, I d appreciate you 
                    giving me a call.

      The Bartender eyes the 20, takes the CARD, which we now see 
      is Raylan s U.S. Marshal card.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Mister, I don t wanna be rude, but 
                    wouldn t it just be easier to buy 
                    yourself another hat?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Probably, but easier isn t what I m 
                    after.  I appreciate it.

      And Raylan s out.  Off the Bartender, watching him go...


      Gary enters the kitchen, in a good mood after his chat with 
      Duffy.  Sitting at the table with a bottle of white wine, is 
      Winona.  Gary pulls FLOWERS from behind his back.

      Gary smiles.  Sets them down.  Sits.

                    I m sorry, Winona.  From the bottom 
                    of my heart.

                                  WINONA
                    For what exactly, Gary?  For lying 
                    to me?  For strange men showing up 
                    at our house?

                                  GARY
                    Listen, if I lied, it was only to 
                    protect you --

                                  WINONA
                    Protect me?  What an epic load of 
                    horse shit!  You accused me of 
                    being paranoid!

                          (trying to calm her)
                    I just didn t want you to worry 
                    because of my mistakes.

                                  WINONA
                    Gary, what mistakes?  What did you 
                    do?

                                  GARY
                    When the market tanked, I got a bit

                    It doesn t matter?  Is that why 
                    that man came to our house about 
                    security?  You worried about people

                    Listen, it s taken care of.  It s 
                    all going to be fine, but I know I 
                    screwed up.  I don t even blame you 
                    for telling Raylan something was 
                    going on.  I wouldn t have trusted

      that he s willing to take risks.  But still...

                    to be able to share the bad with me 
                    just the same as the good --

                                  WINONA
                    I can cope with bad news.  What I 
                    can t abide is you lying, then 
                    accusing me of being out of line.

                                  GARY
                    Honey, I promise, for here on in, 
                    you will know what s happening 
                    every step of the way.  I love you.  
                    I just want you to have everything 
                      I promised when I proposed.

      He takes her hand.  Winona s still not happy, but it s a 
      start.

                                  WINONA
                    I don t need all that, Gary.  I 
                    just need to feel that I can trust 
                    you.  Okay?

                                  GARY
                    Okay.

      Gary smiles.  Hesitantly, Winona does too.  He kisses her.  
      Off these two, finally sharing a nice moment...          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    26.



      We re on TOBY, in the kitchen, cooking dinner, apron and all.  
      He looks content, SINGING HORRIBLY along with some COUNTRY 
      MUSIC.  O.C. hear a DOOR OPEN, then, CLOSE.

                                  TOBY
                    That was quick.  The girls have 
                    fun?

      He goes on stirring his sauce, doesn t even turn as Billy Mac 
      and Duffy enter the kitchen.

                                  DUFFY
                    You should lock your doors, Toby.

      Toby turns.  Takes them in.  Duffy pulls a GUN.

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    It was driving me crazy trying to 
                    remember where I knew you from.  
                    Then, it hit me:  Toby Griffin.  
                    UK s all time leading tackler... a 
                    Super Bowl Champion!

                                  TOBY
                    Alright, look, I get it.  Truth is, 
                    Gary and I ain t even that close.  
                    You want me to back off I ll back 
                    off.  Just leave my family out of 
                    it.

      Duffy just shakes his head.  Those cold eyes.

                                  DUFFY
                    I gave you a chance to walk away, 
                    Toby.  You should ve taken it.

                                  TOBY
                    You gonna shoot me in my kitchen?

                                  DUFFY
                    Actually, Billy Mac here has been 
                    itching to have a go.

                                  TOBY
                    That right?  You want a piece of 
                    Toby Griffin?  Story to tell your 
                    friends?

      Billy starts to come at Toby, who relishes it.

                    Come on white boy, bring that shit.  
                    I ain t gotten to kick any ass in a 
                    long time.

      Toby takes a BIG SWING, which Billy easily ducks, counters 
      with TWO QUICK SHOTS to Toby s ear and jaw.  Toby goes down 
      to a knee, hazy and dazed.

                                  DUFFY
                    Rung your bell a bit did he?  See, 
                    Billy here was a promising feather-
                    weight in his day.  He got injured 
                    too, not unlike you did.  But 
                      apparently, he s still got it.

      Toby, incensed, gets up, stares Billy down.

                                  BILLY MAC
                    Know what my favorite part of 
                    boxing was?  Getting paid to beat 
                    up on colored boys.

      Toby, in a rage, CHARGES BILLY.  Who dodges, then lands TWO 
      QUICK JABS, side steps a SWING by Toby, then hits him flush 
      with a LEFT CROSS and BRINGS HIS BOOT DOWN ON Toby s KNEE.

      Toby goes down in a heap, holding his KNEE, in anguish.

                                  DUFFY
                    No pads here, Toby.  No referee to 
                    blow that whistle for you.

      Off Toby in pain, Billy Mac approaching him menacingly...

      Raylan enters, spots PINTER in a booth, dispatching a LARGE, 
      BLOODY steak.  Raylan approaches.  Pinter sees him coming.

                                  PINTER
                    I asked around about Wynn Duffy.  
                    Guy s crazy.  I mean, some serious 
                        motors-running-but-nobody s-behind-
                    the-wheel shit.  Too mercurial to 
                    run his own show, so generally ends 
                    up working as a middleman.

                                  RAYLAN
                      Mercurial, huh?  Someone been 
                    reading the dictionary?

                                  PINTER

                    Any idea who he s working for these

                                  PINTER
                    Word is he s backin  Emmitt Arnett.  
                    You know him?

                                  RAYLAN

                                  PINTER
                    As a Kentucky thoroughbred.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Arnett s a street hustler.  What s 
                    he doing handing out bridge loans?

                                  PINTER
                    When the economy turned he realized 
                    he could take people s money 
                      legitimately.  Cash loans, high 
                    interest, no questions.  These 
                    days, plenty of folks lookin  for a 
                    lifeboat.  In the end, when they 
                    can t pay it back, he takes all 
                    they got and more.

                                  RAYLAN

                                  PINTER
                    That s what I heard.

      This gets Raylan s mind going.  Gale comes back.  Sets down 
      the check.

                                  GALE
                    Here you go, boys.  No rush now.

                                  PINTER
                    Thank you so much, angel baby.

      Gale smiles, leaves.  Pinter eyes Raylan, then the check.  
      Raylan, taking the hint, scoffs, reaches for his wallet.

                                  PINTER (CONT D)
                    And tip her well, would ya?  No man 
                    ever got laid being stingy.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Best tip I could give her is to 
                    stay away from you.

                                  PINTER
                    Hater.  Through and through.

      Raylan leaves cash on the table.  Gets up to leave.

                                  PINTER (CONT D)
                    Hey, don t you usually wear an 
                    obnoxious hat of some sort?

      Raylan just shakes his head as he walks away from the table, 
      past us, leaving Pinter alone with his steak.


      GRABBED from behind, his GUN taken from his waistband, as 
      he s PUSHED stumbling forward into his DARK apartment.  Billy 
      turns, incensed, but stops dead as a LIGHT SWITCH IS FLIPPED--

      By Raylan, calm as dawn, entering Billy Mac s place, pointing 
      Billy s GUN right at him.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Evenin  Billy.  Mind if I come in?

                                  BILLY MAC
                    I do, as a matter of fact.

      Raylan ignores him, shuts the door.  Billy s apartment is 
      comprised of a small living room/kitchen/dining area.  
      Probably a bedroom in back.  Mismatched furniture.  Crap 
      everywhere.  Gross carpet.  The word depraved comes to mind.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Nice place.

                                  BILLY MAC
                    What the hell you want?

                                  RAYLAN
                    What in God s name is that smell?  
                    You got a dead cat in here or 
                      something?

                                  BILLY MAC
                    Man, gimme my gun back and get 
                    outta here!

                                  RAYLAN
                    Believe me, I can t wait to.

      With the gun Raylan gestures to the tattered couch.  Billy, 
      grudgingly, moves to it, sits.  Raylan drags over a CHAIR, 
      dusts it off, sits across from Billy.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    33.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Easy.  I asked anyone I saw where 
                    the dumbest redneck in all of 
                    Kentucky lives and each and every 
                    person told me to come here.

                                  BILLY MAC
                    You ain t gonna be smilin  when I 
                    knock your teeth out.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What are you and Duffy planning on 
                    doing to Gary Hawkins?

                                  BILLY MAC
                    Man, talk to Duffy.  I just take 
                    orders.

                                  RAYLAN
                    If I wanted to talk to Duffy, I d 
                    be holding his gun on him.

                                  BILLY MAC
                    You wanna know what we gonna do to 
                    Gary?  Or to your ex-wife?
                          (then)
                    Yeah, we s not so stupid as you 
                    thought, huh?  I know why you care 
                    about that dumb bitch.

                                  RAYLAN
                      Disrespect her again Billy Mac, 
                    I ll put a hole in your leg.

                                  BILLY MAC
                    From what I hear she s the one who 
                    filed to divorce, meaning she left 
                    you.  Someone wanted to whoop on my 
                    ex-wife I d probably thank  em.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That s mighty compassionate of you.

                                  BILLY MAC
                          (considers, then)
                    I used to be a fighter.  All I was 
                    ever really good at.  Then I got my 
                    eye hurt, couldn t fight no more.  
                    Wife left me like our house was on 
                    fire.  How s that for compassion?

                    Ah Billy, you re breaking my heart.

                                  BILLY MAC
                    Why d yours leave you, lawman?  
                    Sight of your gun not turn her on 
                    anymore?

                          (threatening)
                    Well just maybe I will.

      Without a word, Raylan FIRES THE GUN, putting a BULLET into 
      the couch inches from Billy Mac, who JUMPS.

                                  BILLY MAC (CONT D)
                    Jesus Christ!

                                  RAYLAN

                                  BILLY MAC
                    He didn t tell me nothing --

      Raylan, not buying it, puts another BULLET into the COUCH, 
      this time inches from Billy s other side.

                                  BILLY MAC (CONT D)
                    Ah, shit!

                                  RAYLAN
                    Next one s for you.

      A beat.  As Raylan aims --

                                  BILLY MAC
                    We were gonna take her!

                                  RAYLAN
                    What?

                                  BILLY MAC
                    We were gonna grab the Mrs..  Use 
                    her to force Gary s hand.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You were going to kidnap Winona?

                                  BILLY MAC

                    Where s Duffy now?

      Raylan aims the gun again, prompting Billy Mac --

                                  BILLY MAC
                    Man, I dunno!  Why ain t you 
                    talking to him?!  Why you bothering 
                    with me?

      Raylan now stands, preparing to leave.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Because you always go after the 
                    weaker link, Billy Mac.  Think you 
                    can remember that?

      Raylan DROPS the CLIP from Billy s GUN, tosses it aside.

                                  BILLY MAC
                    I ain t never gonna forget anything 
                    you just did in here.

      Raylan discharges the ROUND in the CHAMBER.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You go anywhere near Winona, I ll 
                    kill you, you understand?

      Raylan takes the GUN APART, leaves half in the apartment.

                                  BILLY MAC
                    Ain t you been listening?  It ain t 
                    up to me...

      As Raylan walks to the front door, he pockets the other half 
      of the gun and then is GONE, leaving Billy Mac alone and, for 
      the moment, gunless...


      Raylan, at the wheel.  He s got his cell phone to his ear, 
      looks impatient.

                    This isn t CSI: Miami.  And 
                      technically, I m on vacation.

                                  WINONA
                    These men really might kill him...

                                  RAYLAN
                    Not just him, Winona.  I ve gotta 
                    get you out of here.

      Winona now fully grasps the reality of this situation.

                                  WINONA
                    I m begging you, if you care about 
                    me at all, please, help him.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Winona, you ve known me a long 
                    time, you honestly think I m gonna 
                    let you stay in this house if I 
                    leave to go after Gary?

                                  WINONA
                    No, I guess not.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You let me take you somewhere safe.  
                    And I ll go look for Gary.  Deal?

      Off Winona, nodding...


      Raylan drives.  Winona rides.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Open the glove compartment.

      Winona does.  Inside is Raylan s GUN.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    You take that.  Keep it on you.

      Winona takes it.  Stares at it.  Then:





                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    40A.

                    screwing everything up like this.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I didn t come to gloat.

                                  WINONA
                    He was always a dreamer.  Gary.  
                    Had such grand plans...

                                  RAYLAN
                    Gary made his choice.  I can t do 
                    anything about that.  What I can do 
                    is make sure his bad choices don t 
                    get you hurt.

                                  WINONA
                    You always wanted to know why.  Why 
                    him.  That s why, Raylan.  It 
                    wasn t that I liked him more, or he 
                    was smarter, better looking... but 
                    he really wanted things.  He was 
                    genuinely excited about life, its 
                    prospects --

                                  RAYLAN
                          (almost involuntarily)
                    And how s that working out for you?

                                  WINONA
                    I thought you weren t going to 
                    gloat.

                                  RAYLAN
                    And I thought you were a smart, 
                    pragmatic woman.

                                  WINONA
                    Your grind, Raylan.  It s 
                      exhausting.  I don t know how you 
                    shoulder it.  And I... I just 
                    couldn t do it anymore.  I needed 
                    some hope in my life.

      Raylan, stung, processes this.  She s right.  And he knows 
      it.  But this is who he is, and he can t imagine the road 
      he d have to take to change it now.

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    I love him.  Ridiculous as it 
                    sounds now, I built a life with 
                    him, a life I want to continue.

      Off Raylan, who sympathizes with her, though it definitely 
      hurts him to hear those words.  They pull up in front of a 
      MOTEL.  Stop.

                                  RAYLAN
                    If Gary s not at Duffy s I ll call 
                    you.  I need you to think of 
                    anywhere else he might be, okay?
                          (on Winona, nodding)
                    Don t worry.  I ll bring him back.

      OMITTEDB28B28


      Duffy.  Billy Mac.  ARNETT, 40s, in a suit and tie, trying a 
      little too hard to look presentable, the unrefined posture of 
    a guy who grew up with nothing.  He s got a THUG with him, 
      20s, sport coat but no tie, also trying to look like 
      something he isn t.

                                  DUFFY
                          (to Arnett)
                    Right there in the office, huh?

                                  ARNETT
                    Only real upside to having no 
                    windows.

                                  DUFFY
                    And you pay her?

                                  ARNETT
                    Well, not for the head so much as 
                    to leave when she s done, ya know?

      Duffy takes this in.  Huh.  Arnett looks to the CLOCK.  8:52.  
      Turns to Duffy.

                                  ARNETT (CONT D)
                    You ever do any handicapping, 
                    Duffy?

                                  DUFFY
                    Put a guy in a wheelchair once.

                                  ARNETT
                    No.  I m talking about gambling.  
                    Making odds.

                                  DUFFY
                    I m not much of a gambler.

                                  ARNETT
                    It s an interesting thing.  The 
                    goal isn t to correctly predict the 
                    outcome of a game, but to make the 
                    odds appealing enough so you get 
                    equal bets on both sides.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    49.

      CONTINUED:3030

                                  DUFFY
                    And then you collect a percentage 
                    of each bet.

                                  ARNETT
                    That s right.  See, it s a common 
                      misconception that bookies make 
                    money on the outcome of the game, 
                    when they actually make their money 
                    on the volume of bets placed.
                          (then)
                    Now, if you had to make some odds 
                    on our boy Gary showing up here, 
                    what would you put them at?

                                  DUFFY
                    Odds he shows I d probably put at 3 
                    to 1.

                                  ARNETT
                    I think I d take that bet.

                                  DUFFY
                    Odds he shows up with that what you 
                    want... I d put that at 7 to 1.

                                  ARNETT
                      Disappointing odds.  Guy has his 
                    pride, huh?

                                  DUFFY
                    Not only that, he thinks he s 
                    smarter than we are.

                                  ARNETT
                    But he s not, is he?

                                  DUFFY
                    No.  He s not.

                                  THUG
                    How about the odds he shows alone?

      Then, Billy Mac, who s been watching the windows:

                                  BILLY MAC
                    Zero.

      They all turn, see Gary and Raylan approaching the front 
      door.  Everyone gets their game faces on.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    50.

                    That s Givens.  The Marshal I was 
                    telling you about.

      Arnett looks to Duffy: this going to be a problem?  Duffy 
      doesn t have time to answer before Raylan and Gary ENTER.  
      They re both battered and bruised, quite a sight.  They re 
      flanked by Billy Mac and the Thug.  Arnett and Duffy run 
      point.

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    Well, you two are quite the pair.  
                    Marshal Givens, wasn t expecting 
                    you.  You here on official duty of 
                    some sort?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Nah.  I m on vacation.

      Raylan smiles.  Duffy doesn t.

                                  ARNETT
                    Going to have to search you 
                      gentlemen, you don t mind.

      As the Thug and Billy Mac approach our boys:

                                  RAYLAN
                    You must be Emmitt Arnett.

                                  ARNETT
                    That s correct.  Nice to meet you, 
                    Marshal.

      The Thug frisks Gary.  Billy Mac frisks Raylan.

                    You owe me a gun, lawman.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You find one on me you re welcome 
                    to it.

      Billy is not amused.  Frisking is finished; our boys are 
      clean.

                                  ARNETT
                    I was hoping you d bring cash Gary, 
                    seeing as how that s what I gave 
                    you.  But I suppose a cashier s 
                    check will suffice.

                                  GARY
                    I don t have the money, Arnett.

      This sets everyone on edge.  A beat.

                                  ARNETT
                    We had an agreement --

                                  GARY
                    We had an agreement that you were 
                    going to invest in my project.

                                  ARNETT
                    Which I did.  With the 
                      understanding that if I needed to, 
                    I could pull my money at any time.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Which you always intended to do 
                    when Gary was most vulnerable.

                                  ARNETT
                    I really don t see how this is any 
                    of your business, Marshal Givens.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You made it my business when your 
                    men started running around 
                      assaulting people.

      Arnett takes this in, surprisingly, shooting a disapproving 
      look in Duffy s direction.  He then turns back to Raylan.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    52.

                    I m not sure what you re talking 
                    about, but I m a legitimate 
                      businessman --

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, you re not.  You re a parasite 
                    in a suit.  A no class, two bit, 
                      loan-shark who will never get the 
                      trailer-trash stink off of him no 
                    matter how much designer cologne he 
                    tries to cover it with.
                          (then)
                    It s just a shame Gary didn t know 
                    the kind of man you are when he 
                    shook your hand.

      Arnett is fuming.  Trying to contain himself.

                                  ARNETT
                    I came here to conduct a 
                      transaction.  You come here to 
                    insult me?

                                  RAYLAN
                    We ll honor your deal, soon as we 
                    figure out what to do about Duffy 
                    and Billy Mac.

                                  ARNETT
                    What s he talking about?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I ve got them on any number of 
                    counts.  Breaking and entering.  
                    Assault.  Attempted murder, I 
                    really push it.

      Arnett looks at Duffy, genuinely appalled.

                                  ARNETT
                    That true?

                                  DUFFY
                    Gary and his buddy walked into this 
                    office, threatened me first --

                                  ARNETT
                    What the hell did I tell you?  What 
                    was our arrangement?
                          (rage building)
                    How am I supposed to run a business 
                    if this is how you re conducting 
                    yourself on my behalf?!

                                  RAYLAN
                    Can t let this go.  Someone s gotta 
                    be held accountable.

                                  DUFFY
                    This is bullshit.  If he had any 
                    proof he d just arrest me.

                                  RAYLAN
                    These aren t federal crimes, and 
                    like I already told you, I m on 
                    vacation.

                                  ARNETT
                    So what exactly are we talking 
                    about here, Marshal Givens?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Gary will square things with you, 
                    provided Duffy and his mutt admit 
                    what they did, turn themselves in.

      Arnett looks to Duffy.  Is considering it.

                                  DUFFY
                    He s bluffing, can t you see that?  
                    Gary already said he doesn t have 
                    the money!

      Gary reaches into his jacket pocket, extracts an envelope.










                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    54.

      CONTINUED: (6)3030

                                  GARY
                          (this kills him)
                    Inside is a notary signed letter 
                      forfeiting the property to you, 
                    Arnett.  These days it s appraised 
                    right around what I owe you, but 
                    you wait a few years it ll be worth 
                    more.  Contact my broker, he ll set 
                    the escrow in motion.

      Arnett eyes the envelope.

                                  RAYLAN
                    It s yours if Duffy and Billy Mac 
                    give a sworn statement and let me 
                    escort them to County.

      Duffy looks to Arnett, thinking there s no way he s gonna do 
      this.  But Arnett knows this is how it has to be.

                                  ARNETT
                    This is the end of our association, 
                    Duffy.  I can t be a part of 
                    anything the Marshal has described.

                                  DUFFY
                    God damn you, Arnett.  This was 
                    what you wanted --

                                  ARNETT
                    Swear to the Marshal.  Then go.

      Duffy considers for a minute.  Looks like he s going to 
      acquiesce, but then, he PULLS HIS GUN, points it at Arnett!  

      Quickly, the Thug PULLS HIS GUN, puts it on Duffy!

      Then Billy Mac PULLS HIS GUN, PUTS IT ON THE THUG!

      Raylan watches unflinchingly.  Gary takes a step back, scared 
      shitless.  Arnett stands his ground.

                                  DUFFY
                    Why don t you swear?  Tell him you 
                    ordered me to do it?

                                  ARNETT
                    Because that s not the truth --

                                  DUFFY
                    I m not going to prison for you!




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    55.

      CONTINUED: (7)3030

      Duffy takes an aggressive step towards Arnett, which prompts 
      the THUG to SHOOT, hitting Duffy in the LEG, as he drops, his 
      GUN falling from his hand --

      As Raylan TACKLES GARY, as --

      ARNETT DROPS TO THE FLOOR, as --

      BILLY MAC SHOOTS the THUG, who SIMULTANEOUSLY WHEELS AND 
      SHOOTS BILLY MAC, both of them DROPPING, WOUNDED, as --

      RAYLAN quickly SCRAMBLES to GRAB DUFFY S GUN, as --

      DUFFY turns, tries to GRAB HIS GUN, but --

      GARY, in an adrenaline RUSH, launches himself at DUFFY, 
      KNOCKING THE GUN AWAY, as --

      Raylan comes up with Duffy s GUN pointed right at him.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I ve shot people I liked more for 
                    less, Duffy.

      Duffy, wounded, knowing he s screwed, STOPS STRUGGLING.  As 
      Gary gets to his feet, backing away --

      As Arnett also gets to his feet, unscathed --

      As the Thug nurses a WOUND in his gut --

      We now see BILLY MAC, who s DEAD, bullet hole in his 
      forehead.  The initial sequence happened so quickly maybe we 
      missed that this is where Billy got hit.  Either way, he s 
      dead, most noticeably taken in by --

      RAYLAN.  Who stares at Billy Mac as he gets out his phone, 
      DIALS --

      As Arnett takes the ENVELOPE which had fallen to the floor, 
      picks it up, addressing Gary:

                                  ARNETT
                    Sorry it had to be like this.

      On Gary, aghast at all that he s caused --

      To Raylan, phone to his ear, saying:

                                  RAYLAN
                    This is Marshal Raylan Givens.  I 
                    need squad cars and an ambulance 
                      immediately...



                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    55A.

      Off of this carnage, CUT TO --          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    56.



      Raylan (on his phone) and Gary off to the side.  In the B.G. 
      a BODY BAG containing BILLY MAC is ZIPPED CLOSED, prepared to 
      be wheeled out.  Duffy meanwhile is still being tended to, a 
      not too horrible wound in his THIGH.  Raylan hangs up his 
      phone, moves to Gary, who s in shock.

                                  GARY
                    I can t believe all that just 
                    happened.  Doesn t feel real.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Trust me, Gary.  It s real.

                                  GARY
                          (beat, then)
                    I just gave up everything I ve 
                    worked for my entire life.
                          (then)
                    She ll never stay with me.  Winona.  
                    But you must ve known that.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I think you re underestimating her.

                                  GARY
                    And I think you re underestimating 
                    how screwed I really am.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I never had any money.  She d have 
                    stayed with me if I hadn t messed 
                    it up.

                                  GARY
                    I shut her out.  Lied to her.  If 
                    I d been honest and lost everything 
                    maybe she d have gutted it out with 
                    me.  But this...

      A beat.  Then:

                                  RAYLAN
                    You have your life, Gary.  You have 
                    a good woman, a roof over your 
                    head, a career.  Make it work.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    57.

        CONTINUED:B31B31

      Off Gary, who knows that Raylan s right, but can t shake the 
      overall feeling of just how difficult and different his life 
      is about to become...


      Raylan is driving Gary home.  The mood is subdued.  Gary may 
      be free of it, but it doesn t feel that way to him.  A moment 
      later, Raylan pulls the car up in front of Gary s house.  
      Stops.  A beat.

      Gary regards Raylan.  Nods.  Then gets out of the car, starts 
      towards his house.  Raylan sits in the car, watching.  Stay 
      in RAYLAN S POV...

      As Gary nears the front door, it s opened by Winona, who was 
      watching for him.  Gary slows up as Winona comes towards him, 
      not knowing what to expect.  But seeing him there, exhausted 
      and broken, Winona takes pity and takes him into her arms.

      Raylan watches them, holding each other, whispering things he 
      cannot hear.  Then Gary and Winona separate, start towards 
      the house.  But Winona gives one look back to Raylan, just 
      the slightest smile and nod, all the thanks Raylan will get.

      And then Gary and Winona are gone, inside the home they ve 
      made together, as the front door closes and Raylan s still on 
      the outside, alone.

      Just then, his cell phone RINGS.  He checks the number, goes 
      to answer it as he pulls away from the house...


      At the bar, find the TWO DRUNKS whom Raylan fought, sitting 
      at the bar, rolling DICE for drinks.  Drunk #1 wears Raylan s 
      hat like a trophy.  Drunk #2 rolls.  Grins.  Whoops it up.

                                  DRUNK #1
                    Lucky prick.

                                  DRUNK #2
                          (to the Bartender)
                    Sir, you d better set us up again.  
                    My friend here will be paying.

      The same Bartender, obliging, refills their SHOT GLASSES.  As 
      Drunk #1 is reaching to take his, a HAND comes in and takes 
      it first.  Drunk #1, perturbed, looks over and we REVEAL 
      RAYLAN.  He downs the shot.  Places the glass back on the 
      bar.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    58.

      CONTINUED:3232

                                  RAYLAN
                    Remember me?

      Confronted with sober Raylan looking mean as hell, Drunk #1 
      all of a sudden isn t sure what to do.  He looks to his 
      buddy, gathers some liquid courage, then back to Raylan.

                                  DRUNK #1
                    Thought I told you not to come back 
                    in here.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Just came for my hat.

      Raylan, stone cold, just stares at him.

                                  DRUNK #1
                          (slightly wilted)
                    Well, I ve kinda taken a liking to 
                    it.  Fits pretty good.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m a little more sober now.  Sure 
                    you wanna make me ask again?

      Now the few people in the bar are watching this nervously, 
      including the Bartender.  Raylan does not look like a man you 
      want to fuck with.

                                  DRUNK #1
                    We were just trying to have a good 
                    time.  You were the one outta 
                    line...

      Raylan shifts his posture:  his patience is waning, and 
      everyone can feel it.

                                  DRUNK #1 (CONT D)
                    Hell man, I was always planning on 
                    giving you back the hat, why do you 
                    think I wore it in here?

      Raylan waits as Drunk #1 takes off the hat and hands it over.  
      Raylan examines it and, satisfied with its condition, places 
      it back on his head, and with the swagger he was missing at 
      the top of our show, walks his bad ass past us and out of the 
      bar.
