                I guess so.  With Rachel Lawton, 
                it's always something--                

                              ALAN
                She a little wacky, is she?

                              CHARLIE
                Maybe a little.  In grad school, 
                she was into odd ideas.  Like, she 
                said certain top scientists might 
                be  aliens sent to help mankind.   

                              ALAN
                She must've known Larry --

                              CHARLIE
                Very funny.  She actually wrote a 
                paper that said the Mars Rover has 
                been running longer than predicted 
                because Martians keep repairing it.

                              ALAN
                She was serious?

                              CHARLIE
                She claimed it was a joke, but it 
                was well reasoned.  That's the 
                thing about Rachel -- she's 
                actually a brilliant thinker.  And  
                fun to hang out with, usually. 

                              ALAN
                What's her field?

                              CHARLIE
                She's a statistician -- specializes 
                in demography.   

                              ALAN 
                There's been some crazy 
                  conspiracies.  Maybe it takes a 
                brilliant, nutty thinker to spot 
                them.  Trouble is -- that's just  
                the kind of person nobody believes.

  Charlie thinks about that, then looks at Rachel's list.

  CLOSE ON THE LIST:   Four names, three checked off.

                  absorption of acetaminophen, 
                  hydrocodone and alcohol.

  PULL BACK, REVEAL CHARLIE and DON.  

                              CORONER (CONT'D)
                My preliminary finding is Rachel 
                Lawton died from a non-accidental 
                overdose of prescription 
                  medication.

  The Coroner exits.  Charlie's thoughtful, his emotions 
    contained.  

                              CHARLIE
                Don, she was scared and upset, 
                maybe erratic.  But she didn't seem 
                  suicidal.   

                              DON
                I did a quick background before 
                coming down here.  She's been 
                seeing a therapist for two years.

                              CHARLIE
                For what?

                              DON
                  Depression.  Employment records 
                include comments about emotional 
                  outbursts, questionable stability. 

                              CHARLIE
                So -- is this the end of it? 

                              DON
                We'll do a basic followup.  Doubt 
                it'll go anywhere.   

  Charlie looks down at Rachel.  


  Charlie reads an FBI REPORT on the THREE DEAD PEOPLE on 
  Rachel's list.  On a chalkboard, he's written the names and 
  causes of death:  heart attack, asthma, accident.  He adds 
  Rachel's name and possible suicide.  Jots a fast calculation.    

  INSERT: He's written:  10 million to 1

  Charlie looks up to find OSWALD KITTNER. 

                              CHARLIE
                Oswald.  Thanks for coming by.

                              OSWALD
                  I wouldn't thank me yet. 'Cause I'm 
                guessing you want to talk to me 
                again about enrolling or whatever. 

                              CHARLIE
                Yes, in a special program.  For 
                people like yourself.

                                OSWALD
                Nice way of putting it.  But -- I'm 
                just not the CalSci type.  I'm 
                terrible at tests.  The worst.  And 
                I can't talk to college professors.  

                              CHARLIE
                You talk to me.

                              OSWALD
                We met over baseball stats.  That's 
                the one thing I know.  

                              CHARLIE
                With training, you could work in 
                any field you want.       

  Oswald's noticed Charlie's scribbled calculations.

                              OSWALD
                What's this?  Ten million to one?

                              CHARLIE

                people she worked with dying in a

                      (points to Rachel's name)
                I knew her.  I identified her body 
                at the morgue this morning.

                                OSWALD
                That's terrible.  I'm so sorry.

                              CHARLIE
                She claimed these people had been 
                killed over something they knew.  

                                OSWALD
                What about this one that's not 
                checked off?

                              CHARLIE
                Still alive, I guess.  

  But Charlie frowns, goes to his laptop, Googles the name.  An 
  entry for a political scientist comes up.  Charlie grabs his 
  cell.  As he makes the call, Oswald goes to the laptop.  

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                Hi, I'm trying to reach Dr. 
                  Reynolds.

  Oswald pulls Charlie's arm, turns him toward the computer -- 

                                RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                I'm sorry, Dr. Reynolds is no 
                longer with us.  Are you a friend -- 
                or family member?

                That's okay.  Thanks for your help.

  He hangs up.  Picks up a pencil, calculates quickly--

                              OSWALD
                What're the odds that these five 
                people died in a two week period?

                              CHARLIE
                About 700 million to one.  Rachel 
                was telling the truth.

                                    ACT ONE


  Don comes in to see Charlie at the chalk board -- same 
    calculations here as he had done with Oswald.

                              DON
                Charlie, you sure about this?

                              CHARLIE 
                More than sure.  It's 700 million 
                to one, the odds these five people 
                would be dead. No one of the deaths 
                seem suspicious, but do the math 
                and it becomes very suspicious.

                              DON
                You said "five?"  There were four.

                              CHARLIE
                Dr. Robert Reynolds.  Political 
                  scientist at Berkeley.  Car 
                accident two days ago. 

  Charlie hands him a print out of the article.

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                The FBI needs to look into this.    

                              DON
                You're sure this isn't one of those 
                  situations you warn about -- random 
                events linked without cause?

                              CHARLIE
                Don, I know how busy you are.  The 
                math here is solid -- investigating 
                Rachel Lawton's death will not be a 
                waste of time.  

  Don looks at his brother -- sees what this means to him.

                interest them in a good problem. 
                Get them obsessed, and they forget 
                to be afraid.  What's he into?

                We tore apart Rachel Lawton's 
                apartment and the hotel room where 
                she died.  Looked everywhere.  
                Didn't find the documentation she 
                told Charlie about.

                Well, this is everything.

                pens now with flash drives inside.

  Colby finds a couple pens -- quickly takes them apart.

                I've finished the forensic autopsy

                  Apparently her killer didn't have a 
                lot of patience.  Though she had a 
                  potentially lethal dose of alcohol 
                and painkillers in her, Rachel 
                Lawton died of asphyxiation.

                How?

                              MEDICAL EXAMINER
                She has traces of cotton fiber in 
                her lungs, likely suffocated with a 
                pillow or towel after she was  
                  unconscious.  Sort of thing that, 
                in the absence of suspicious 
                  circumstances, might be missed.

                So this isn't five random deaths -- 
                we've got at least one murder.

                              CHARLIE
                It s mathematically improbable 
                these deaths are coincidence.    

                              MEEKS
                To make a case, we need a motive.   
                And live witnesses.  You say three 
                of the dead did consulting work for 
                J. Everett Tuttle --

                He got a rep for playing dirty on 
                Wall Street.  The SEC made a run at 
                him, got nowhere.  The New York AG 
                indicted him on fraud but two 
                  witnesses disappeared, they 
                couldn't make a case.

                One was later found in Greece.  The 
                other one never turned up. 

                              CHARLIE
                You think he's capable of murder?  

                              MEEKS
                They think so in New York, but they 
                had no evidence.

                              MEGAN

                              DAVID
                Not at all.     

                              COLBY
                The only time he expressed the 
                  slightest interest was when -- 

                              MEGAN
                -- don t tell me.  When you asked 
                him about himself.

                and go to movies and concerts.  
                Rachel said we could spend the rest 
                of our lives studying, but we'd 
                only be young for a while.

                This is starting to make sense.   
                J. Everett Tuttle was Brasher s 
                largest contributor.  He's the 
                driving force behind the campaign.

                Here it is.  In the Brasher race, a 
                  preliminary audit indicated 
                  discrepancies.  But the final 
                report said the race was clean.

                Each reps over 2 million people --

                              CHARLIE
                I can try.  Every organization can 
                be analyzed mathematically.  In 
                this case there's the added 
                  parameter of secrecy, which is at 
                risk if the number of people 
                involved exceeds the number who can 
                be controlled.

                              COLBY 
                You could mathematically analyze

                              CHARLIE
                Sure.  JFK conspiracy theories 
                require the cooperation of the CIA, 
                FBI -- a number of people involved 
                that, mathematically, would make 
                keeping the secret impractical.

                Which is why we all know about it.

                              CHARLIE
                You see what I'm getting at.  A 
                small conspiracy is far more likely 
                to be successful than a larger one.

                              DAVID 
                But can this analysis pinpoint the 
                role of any remaining witnesses? 

                              CHARLIE
                Yes -- we'll look at employees from  
                  Brasher s campaign and Tuttle s 
                firm -- and match them against who 
                you'd need for an election fraud.

                These are the possible answers.  We 
                know the host got nine different

                the couple that both shook four 
                hands.

                that got looked into.  

  BRASHER S a big man who'd be at home on a used car lot. 
  Talking to Don and Colby.  A STAFFER nearby.  

                              BRASHER (CONT'D)
                The county conducted an audit of 
                the election, am I right?

  He looks to the Staffer, who nods.

                              BRASHER (CONT'D)
                Well, there you go.

                  Everett's my good friend, we go way 
                back.  He's the one that talked me 
                into running for public office, 
                told me I'd make a great 
                  supervisor.  Everybody else said no 
                way I could win, impossible.  They 
                sure look like idiots now.  

                              COLBY
                Sir, do you know this woman?

  He shows him a photo of Rachel Lawton. 

                              BRASHER
                Nope, never seen her.  Cute girl.

  Getting scared, suspicious --

  Megan, at a dining table with STACY ALIANO, Jane's sister.

                I take care of Pico, Jane's dog, 
                when she's out of town.  Please, do 
                you know what's happened to my 
                sister? 

                              MEGAN
                No, we're trying to locate her.

                              STACY 
                She does a lot of consulting -- 
                travels all the time.  But she's 
                never just not shown up like this--  

                              MEGAN
                How was she when you last spoke? 

                              STACY
                  Distracted, but that s Jane.  One 
                of those brilliant people always 
                  processing four things at once.

                              STACY
                She wanted to be sure I'd have time 
                for Pico -- feed him, walk him in 
                his favorite park.  I told her of 
                course.  I know what he means to 
                her.  

  She shows Megan a photo of Jane hugging the dog.

                She even made him a Christmas 
                stocking -- this dog's like a child 
                to her.  

                              MEGAN
                Has she spoken to anyone else that 
                you've heard from?  Friends, other

                No, not that I've heard.  And 
                that's what's really scaring me -- 
                she's never gone this long without 
                calling Mom and Dad.   

  Megan looks down at Pico -- who's watching her.

                  Including  voting equipment the

                And with LA County s huge 
                  population, rigged machines here

                named Paul Prescott.  Two years

                The voting machine makes illegal 
                  alterations, but since it happened 
                in the operating system, not the 
                software, there's no evidence.

                Mess with the operating system, you 
                can make the machine do anything?

                In this case, it was designed so 
                the machines only execute the bad 
                program on election day.  After 
                that, it erases itself.

                Jane Aliano can testify to this -- 
                long as Tuttle doesn't get to her.   

                              DON
                We need to move her somewhere safe.   


  Cliff Dawkins across from Don and Meeks.  His confidence 
  gone.  He's pale, distracted. 

                              MEEKS
                Mr. Dawkins, we just arrested three 
                men trying to assassinate Jane 
                Aliano.  They're Tru-Poll Security.  
                On your company payroll.

                We found the fraudulent coding on

                              MEEKS
                You conspired with J. Everett 
                Tuttle to tamper with the voting 
                machines and fix the election.

                              DON
                And kill six people. 

                              MEEKS 
                You will cooperate with our 
                  investigation.  Or you're looking 
                at the death penalty. 

  Dawkins looks up at them --

                              DON
                Maybe you don't know what you're up 
                against --

                              DAWKINS
                No, I do.  I know exactly what I'm 
                up against.  I intend to fully 
                  cooperate. 

                              MEEKS
                You'll give us Tuttle?

                              DAWKINS 
                No.  Tuttle wasn t part of this.
                This was my plan.  My people.  My 
                  machines.  Tuttle had absolutely 
                nothing to do with any of it.   

  Off Don and Meeks' stunned reactions --


  Meeks fuming to Don and Colby.

                And his goons back it.  They took 
                orders only from him, never even 
                heard of an Everett Tuttle.

                Tuttle played this perfectly.

  They look in at Dawkins.  Who's shrunken into himself.


  Alan and Don, who's sipping a beer while trying to explain --

                I can t talk to the press about an 
                open investigation.  And I 
                  wouldn t, not without proof.

                              ALAN
                So how did the paper get the story?

  Charlie comes down the stairs --

                              CHARLIE
                They saw an advance copy of an 
                article that will run in the  
                Journal of Political Science. 

                              ALAN 
                Charlie, you did this?

                              CHARLIE 
                  I submitted an article detailing my 
                recent research. 

                              DON
                You can get into a lot of trouble --

                              CHARLIE
                  Possible, but unlikely.  I used 
                  information in the public record. 
                And the organizational analysis we 
                  performed linking Tuttle s firm, 
                  Brasher s campaign and Tru-Poll. 
                All of it mathematically solid.

                              DON
                The journal leaked it to the Times?

                              CHARLIE
                They sent a summary to the general 
                press.  Did you know it s extremely 
                  difficult to prevent a scientist 
                from publishing research?  Academic 
                  freedom s big in this country.

                              DON
                  Apparently so.  

                              CHARLIE
                It cost Tuttle time and money to 
                devise this scheme.  Now it's 
                useless -- voting officials know 
                what to look for. 

                              DON
                You did good on this, Charlie.

                              CHARLIE
                But Tuttle's not going to jail --

                              DON
                Oh, I'm not through with him yet.  
                Not for a long time.
