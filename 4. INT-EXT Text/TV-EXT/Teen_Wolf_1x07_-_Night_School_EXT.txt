      Holding still, Stiles glances into the darkness. All he sees 
      is the breath pluming from his lips. Then feet moving, he 
      races to the side of the building where the bolt cutters lie. 
      Grabbing them, he turns back to see--

      Scott staring out the glass doors. Trying to speak. Trying to 
      say--          TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/112.

      Stiles slowly turns his head as SOMETHING lopes out of the 
      darkness, a swiftly moving POV coming right for him.


      Down the sidewalk from her home, Allison looks from one end 
      of the street to the next, still waiting for Scott. Her phone 
      RINGS and she puts it to her ear.

                    Lydia says we re coming to get you.

                    26 minutes late.

                    You hear that? First it s  He s 
                    only 26 minutes late.  A month 
                    later it s  he only hits me when 
                    he s drunk.  Slippery slope,

                    Too late.

      Jackson pulls up in his Porsch  with Lydia. He rolls down the 
      window. Strangely, his face has lost the paleness, a 
      healthier glow returning to his cheeks.

                                    JACKSON
                    Lydia gets what Lydia wants.

      Allison glances down the road again. Still no sign of Scott.

                    Come on, get in. We can stop by his 
                    place and see if he s there.

      Allison finally gives a reluctant sigh. But the moment she 
      opens the door to get in the back, her phone BUZZES.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1112.

                    freaking hour late?

      Allison eyes her phone with a curious gaze.

                                    ALLISON
                    Not exactly.


      Jackson s Porsch  swerves into the lot. He gets out of the 
      driver s side, pulling the seat up to let Allison out. They 
      both glance at the Jeep parked a few spaces away.

                                    JACKSON
                    What are they doing here anyway?

                    All I got was this...

      She holds up her cell phone to show him a TEXT: Meet me at 
      the school - Scott.

                    That one looks open.

      Allison points to the door lying open. The BOLT CUTTERS sit 
      upright against it, carefully placed there to hold it open. 
      Almost as if welcoming Allison into the school.

                                    JACKSON

      She pauses, turning back to him.

                                    ALLISON
                    You have this look like you re

                    It s a good look for you.

      From the Porsch , Lydia notices the moment between them. And 
      clearly doesn t like it.

      As she steps into the dark corridor, the BOLT CUTTERS slip, 
      falling to the pavement... allowing the door to CLATTER SHUT.

      Ignoring her, he leans closer, noting the strange grooves in 
      the hood. Like claw marks. He then glances to the doors of 
      the school. And starts toward them.
