Abdullah's family is inside the house. There is a room, a
small table and a simple kitchen. Yasira (38) is roasting
some goat meat assisted by Yamil (16) and Zora (17), her
daughters.
Abdullah and his sons, Yussef (13) and Ahmed (14), are sitting
on the floor around the small table, looking at a well-
conserved .270 caliber Winchester 60 rifle.
HASSAN
(To Abdullah)
It's almost new.
He takes out several boxes of cartridges from his satchel.
HASSAN (CONT'D)
Three hundred cartridges...
He opens a box and shows them one of the golden bullets.
HASSAN (CONT'D)
The hunter who gave it to me said
you can hit up to three kilometers
away.
ABDULLAH
How much do you want for everything?
HASSAN
One thousand dirhams.
2.
ABDULLAH
One thousand dirhams? I'll give you
one thousand and a goat.
Abdullah and Hassan exchange a look and Hassan smiles.
4
Zora is inside, undressing. She has a long body and her
cinnamon skin is soft and clean. Every now and then she
aims a complicit glance at the crack through which Yussef is
spying.
AHMED (O.S.)
Yussef...
Zora turns around toward where the voice is coming from.

Amelia (54), a maternal, Mexican woman with a pleasant face,
is playing Monopoly with Debbie (4) and Mike (5). They are
both typically American kids.
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
I won...
MIKE
No, I won.
The phone rings and Amelia goes to answer it.
AMELIA
(In English)
Yes... yes sir... yes sir, Mrs. Rachel
told me...I'm very sorry. How is
Mrs. Susan?... No sir, don't worry...
Amelia turns to Mike.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Your dad is calling.
Mike runs to the phone and grabs it.
MIKE
Hi dad... dad, guess what? Today, at
school, they brought some baby
chickens...I held one in my hand. He
was really little and he was all
warm...
(A beat)
Dad, are you ok?...And Mariana wanted
to take one home, but the teacher
didn't let her...
14
Amelia is putting Debbie and Mike to sleep.
They are both
lying in bed. Amelia sits next to them.
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Did you brush your teeth?
Mike shows her his teeth so she can see he did.
MIKE
Will you tell us a story?
AMELIA
One and then you're going to sleep.
Both children nod.
9.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
(Her entire story in
Spanish)
Once there was a hawk who wanted to
fly higher than everyone else. He
trained every day and hunted little
birds so he could eat them and be
strong.
MIKE
Pajaritos?
Little birds?
AMELIA
Of course, that's what hawks eat.
So, one day the hawk flew so, so
high that it crashed into an airplane.
It fainted and started to fall. And
when it was about to hit the ground,
all the birds flew toward him and
saved him.
DEBBIE
They saved him?
AMELIA
Yes, and when the hawk was healthy
again he went to talk to the birds
and said: I want to thank you for
saving me, but I can't change and
I'm going to keep hunting you. The
little birds answered: we don't care
that you hunt us, because that's who
you are. But we will always save
you, because that's who we are.
The children are silent.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
(In English)
Did you like it?
DEBBIE
No.
Amelia moves to turn out the light.
DEBBIE (CONT'D)
Leave it on.
Amelia stands still beside the switch.
AMELIA
Quedamos en que se iban a dormir con
la luz apagada.
DEBBIE
But I'm scared.
10.
AMELIA
No pasa nada.
DEBBIE
I'm scared that what happened to Pat
is gonna happen to me.
Amelia sits down next to her and caresses her.
AMELIA
A ti no te va a pasar eso...
DEBBIE
Pat died while she was sleeping.
AMELIA
That only happens to some babies
when they're really little.
MIKE
Then why did daddy get so angry at
mommy?
AMELIA
He wasn't angry, he was just very
sad.
DEBBIE
He left.
Amelia doesn't know what else to say. She pats Debbie's head.
AMELIA
Go to sleep. I'll sit here with you,
but you can't talk anymore.
They both nod and snuggle under their blankets. Amelia watches
them silently.
15
Amelia (54) sleeps. The sun is just starting to rise. A
phone rings distantly. Amelia awakes. She sits up, listens
intently and hears the ringing.
She grabs a robe from a chair beside her, puts it on and
gets up to answer the phone.
16
Amelia enters the kitchen and answers a wall phone.
AMELIA
Yes...
11.
RICHARD (O.S.)
Amelia, it's Richard. We're going to
have to be here a few more days here
in Morocco than we expected and Rachel
wasn't able to find anyone to take
care of the kids.
AMELIA
Your sister-in-law promised me to
find someone.
RICHARD (O.S.)
Amelia, this is very serious.
Amelia looks worried.
AMELIA
It's because... I told Mrs. Jones
three months ago that today is my
son's wedding.
RICHARD (O.S.)
Amelia, this is an emergency. Cancel
your son's wedding. I'll pay for
another one.
AMELIA
Sir, everything is ready. Can't anyone
come take care of the kids? It's
just one day.
RICHARD (O.S.)
We need you, Amelia... hold on.
Richard stops talking. We hear voices in the background.
RICHARD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Amelia, we're really counting on
you. I have to go. Goodbye.
He hangs up.
Amelia stares into empty space.
17
Debbie (4) and Mike (5) are having breakfast while Amelia
leans on the sink and looks at them, overwhelmed.
AMELIA
(To Debbie, in Spanish)
Do you want another quesadilla?
DEBBIE
Mhh.
Amelia turns around to warm up a tortilla. Mike stops eating
his cereal and looks at her.
12.
MIKE
How many little birds did the hawk
eat?
Amelia turns around and sees Mike, who is truly worried.
AMELIA
(In English)
None, because he started to like
quesadillas.
Amelia strokes his hair. A car horn honks. Amelia looks
out and sees a school bus parked outside the house.
DEBBIE
Is the bus here?
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Yes, but today you're not going to
school.
DEBBIE
Why?
AMELIA
We have things to do.
Amelia turns around and walks out to the street. Through
the door we can see her saying something to the bus driver.
The school bus leaves and Amelia walks back into the house.
18
Debbie and Mike are watching cartoons while Amelia talks on
the phone.
AMELIA
(Both in Spanish)
I just want you to take of them for
today.
WOMAN (O.S.)
I can't, Mrs. Black is home.
AMELIA
And she won't go out?
WOMAN (O.S.)
No, I don't think so.
AMELIA
Ok, thanks.
I'll call you tomorrow.
She hangs up and remains pensive.
13.
19
Amelia is packing the children's clothes in a small suitcase.
Debbie and Mike, curious, watch her.
MIKE
Are we going to see your house?
AMELIA
Yes, you're going to see my house.
MIKE
Is it far?
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Not very.
14.
22
Susan sits next to the window, in the middle of the bus.
She looks hurt and sad. Richard walks over and sits next to
her.
The bus starts. Through the window, Richard can still see
the boy with the binoculars. He smiles until he sees an older
boy snatch the binoculars away and push the little boy.
The bus drives away, but Richard can't take his eyes off the
scene. The older boy walks away with the binoculars.
27
The bus drives on. Some of the old men sleep. Susan leans
her head against the window and watches the landscape scroll
past. Richard sits beside her silently.
Susan holds out her hand and takes Richard's, as a sign of
reconciliation. He holds hers and caresses it.
Susan gets comfortable to try to sleep. She closes her eyes
when suddenly something smashes the window and Susan collapses
forward.
Richard turns to look at the punctured glass and then Susan.
RICHARD
Susan, what's wrong?
19.
Susan doesn't answer, limp on her seat.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
What happened?
Richard lifts her up and when he does he sees a thread of
blood run down her neck. Richard yells at the driver.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Stop the bus, stop, my wife's been
hurt.
29
In an indoor volleyball court with bleachers, several Japanese
girls play volleyball. They all compete intensely for the
point. There is excitement, but everything occurs quietly.
A player jumps and spikes the ball. Chieko (16), tall,
beautiful, with strands of hair painted purple, volleys the
ball back up. It reaches one of her teammates who sets up
another to spike it.
Chieko's team wins the point. The referee, instead of
whistling, lifts up a red flag.
The players congratulate each other silently, in sign
language. The only sound we can here is the parents' clapping
as they watch the game from the stands.
Chieko's team serves. Again, the game is heated. A rival
player spikes the ball, and it is barely out of bounds.
However, the referee, with his red flag, calls the point.
Chieko is upset and goes to argue with him.
CHIEKO
(In sign language)
The ball was out.
REFEREE
(In sign language)
No, it was good.
Chieko gestures violently.
One of her teammates goes to
calm her down.
TEAMMATE
Let it go.
Chieko breaks loose and approaches the referee.
CHIEKO
That was out.
REFEREE
It was on the line.
20.
CHIEKO
You're not just deaf, you're blind.
REFEREE
You're out.
Chieko is furious.
She starts to make obscene gestures.
CHIEKO
You're an asshole.
The coach walks onto the court. He holds her to calm her
down and then takes her away. Despite Chieko's violent
reaction, everything is still silent. From the bleachers,
Yasujiro (47), Chieko's father, dressed in a nice suit with
the tie undone, with a sad pride about him, disapproves of
his daughter's actions.
30
Chieko sits on a bench in her underwear. She looks aggravated
and absorbed in her own thoughts. Her other teammates get
dressed. Two of them walk past wrapped in towels, freshly
showered, and stand in front of her. They talk to each other
in sign language.
TEAMMATE 1
You shouldn't have lost your temper.
We lost the game.
CHIEKO
It wasn't my fault, it was the ref.
TEAMMATE 2
If you hadn't been thrown out, we
would've won the game.
Chieko, angry, gets up and starts to rummage through her
locker. Her teammate walks over and gets her attention.
TEAMMATE 1
Why are you in a bad mood?
Chieko doesn't answer.
Teammate 2 approaches.
TEAMMATE 2
She's always in a bad mood because
nobody's fucked her yet.
She caps this with an obscene gesture that bothers Chieko.
CHIEKO
I'm gonna fuck your dad to get rid
of my mood.
Teammate 1 laughs, amused. Teammate 2 gives Chieko a scornful
look. Chieko smiles sardonically.
21.
31
Yasujiro drives while Chieko looks at the swarming Tokyo
streets. She is wearing a skirt revealing of her long
volleyball legs.
Her fathers speaks to her in sign language.
YASUJIRO
What do you want to eat?
CHIEKO
I said I'd meet my friends from the
team at Eve's.
YASUJIRO
Weren't we going to have lunch
together?
CHIEKO
Dad, I told you I was going to eat
with them, but you never pay attention
to me.
Yasujiro shakes his head in disapproval.
CHIEKO (CONT'D)
My mother always paid attention to
me.
YASUJIRO
Why do you want to fight?
They don't say anything else.
The traffic is chaotic.
YASUJIRO (CONT'D)
I miss your mother too.
Chieko just looks at him.
YASUJIRO (CONT'D)
I'm doing what I can, sweetie.
They don't say anything else.
The traffic is chaos.
32
Eve's is a restaurant full of t.v.'s, noise, video games.
There is smoke, and people talking everywhere. Chieko moves
through the crowd. A hostess intercepts her.
HOSTESS
Do you have a table?
Chieko doesn't manage to read her lips. The hostess, smiling,
awaits an answer. Chieko waits, expectant, for the hostess
to repeat herself.
HOSTESS (CONT'D)
Do you have a table?
Chieko nods and points at her group of girlfriends, who are
sitting on the barstools next to the bar.
The hostess smiles another stupid smile and lets Chieko by.
Further off, her friends spot her and make silly faces.
Chieko laughs, walks over to them. They are all dressed the
same: short skirts, tight t-shirts. Some of them have
piercings in their nose, lips and ears. They all exude
hormones in their silence.
Chieko goes to talk to them in sign language.
CHIEKO
Why all the way in the corner?
Mitsu, with a good body, not very tall and with violet
highlights in her hair, points at a pair of tables where a
group of young men are drinking beer.
MITSU
Because of the view.
Chieko turns around and stares at one of them wearing a Milan
jersey. Their eyes meet. Chieko keeps her eyes on him, and
the boy finally turns away.
MITSU (CONT'D)
Do you like him?
Chieko nods without taking her eyes off him.
23.
34
Chieko, Mitsu and another of their friends are playing a
pinball game that makes noises whenever the ball hits a wall.
The young man in the Milan jersey approaches Chieko.
YOUNG MAN
Hello.
Neither Chieko, nor her friends answer. The guy turns to
look at one of his friends, who signals for him to insist.
YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
Can I play with you?
Chieko, obviously, cannot hear him. She keeps playing.
Suddenly, Mitsu notices the young man's presence and taps
Chieko on the shoulder. Chieko turns around and is surprised.
The young man turns to look toward his friends as he speaks.
YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
Do you want to come have a drink?
Chieko gets frustrated; she cannot read his lips. He stops
looking at his friends and awaits an answer, but all he sees
is three silent girls staring at him stupefied.
Chieko talks to Mitsu in sign language.
CHIEKO
Tell him I couldn't read his lips.
The young man, upon seeing them communicate, is caught off
guard. He turns around and walks toward his friends without
saying a word.
35
Chieko leans on the sink while Mitsu pees in one of the
stalls. Chieko is noticeably upset.
Mitsu walks out of the stall, fixing her skirt.
She sees
Chieko is distressed.
MITSU
(In sign language)
What's the matter?
CHIEKO
(In sign language)
They look at us like we're monsters.
MITSU
Oh, come off it.
24.
Chieko is at a loss for words. Mitsu stares at her: it looks
like another one of many tantrums.
Chieko hikes up her skirt and starts to pull down her panties.
MITSU (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
CHIEKO
Now they're going to meet the real
hairy monster.
She makes the gesture of sticking her finger up a hole, then
goes to the toilet, throws her panties in and flushes. She
turns to look at Mitsu defiantly, who cannot help but laugh.
36
Chieko sits on one of the restaurant's benches. Before her
is a new group of young men. Mitsu and Chieko exchange a
look. Provocatively, Chieko crosses her legs slowly revealing
her pussy.
One of the young men seems to notice, and is stunned. Chieko
smiles and does it again. He watches Chieko again and
discretely turns to one of his friends to tell him.
Chieko turns her back to him and faces the bar.
She looks
over at Mitsu, who shakes her head, amused.
A beeper rings on Chieko's skirt. She picks it up and reads:
"Don't forget your appointment with the dentist. Papa."
She puts the beeper away and turns toward Mitsu.
CHIEKO
I'll see you later at my place.
She mischievously turns toward the table where the young man
was, and as she gets off the bench she spreads her legs wide
open, flashing him shamelessly.
She struts out.
37
Yussef and Ahmed are sitting on their mats, looking at each
other, pale, scared and quiet. Yasira walks in to see them,
followed by her daughters. She turns to Ahmed.
YASIRA
What are you doing here?
Ahmed, livid, cannot answer.
YUSSEF
Something we ate gave us a stomach
ache.
Yasira stares harshly at Ahmed.
YASIRA
And is that why you're insulting
your sister?
26.
Ahmed looks at Zora, then Yussef, and then is silent.
YUSSEF
We were feeling really ill.
Yasira points toward the corral.
YASIRA
The goats are going to feel even
worse if they don't eat. Take them
out again.
AHMED
Our stomach really hurts.
YASIRA
Then start jerking the meat.
Yasira walks out.
Yussef and Zora exchange a look.
40
Yussef and Ahmed are jerking a couple of young goats with
very sharp knives. They set the thin strips on newspaper.
They look nervous.
They talk in whispers.
AHMED
D'you think something happened?
YUSSEF
I don't know.
AHMED
People were screaming.
They are silent for a long while.
AHMED (CONT'D)
It was your fault.
Yussef stares at him in disbelief.
YUSSEF
It was both our faults. We both
shot.
(A beat)
Swear to me you'll never say anything.
Ahmed won't answer. Yussef looks around the room to make
sure nobody is listening to them.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
Swear.
Nobody, never.
Ahmed remains pensive.
He sighs and answers.
27.
AHMED
I swear.
Nobody.
41
Abdullah and his children sit at the small table while the
women prepare the food. A column of smoke rises from the
fire where they are roasting goat meat and toasting bread.
Yamil, the youngest of the daughters, sets some bread on the
table. Abdullah takes it, tears some off and starts to eat.
He turns to Yussef.
ABDULLAH
Did you kill any jackals?
YUSSEF
We shot at them, but didn't hit them.
ABDULLAH
You have to kill them. If not they're
going to eat all the goats.
Yasira sets the strips of goat meat on the table. Abdullah
serves himself some. His children wait until he's done to
serve themselves.
YASIRA
Why are you home so late?
Abdullah starts talking with his mouth full.
28.
ABDULLAH
They closed the road, and we had to
take the long way around.
(He swallows)
Apparently some terrorists killed an
American tourist.
Ahmed and Yussef shoot each other a nervous glance.
YASIRA
An American?
ABDULLAH
Yes, the terrorists attacked a tour
bus on the road.
YASIRA
But there aren't any terrorists here.
Abdullah finishes his mouthful. He wipes himself with his
sleeve. Ahmed doesn't even dare raise his eyes.
ABDULLAH
You never know.
Yussef, nervous, looks up.
YUSSEF
And how do you know the American
died?
ABDULLAH
That's what they were saying. The
police are looking for the culprits.
Yussef and Ahmed again exchange a furtive glance.
43
Night. An oil lamp in a Nescafe jar lights the house. The
family sleeps in the only two rooms in the house. One of
them is the parents room, the other the children's.
We hear a goat bleating in the darkness. Abdullah's snoring.
Yasira's breathing. The crunching of wood in the night cold.
Neither Yussef, nor Ahmed can sleep.
They both look at each
other, anxious.
44
Debbie and Mike stare through the windows, amazed at the new
world they are entering: other people, other architecture,
other colors, other noises.
Santiago turns towards them while he's driving.
SANTIAGO
See how easy it is to get into
paradise?
DEBBIE
Is this Mexico?
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Yes, this is Mexico.
MIKE
My mom told us Mexico is really
dangerous.
Santiago turns toward the kids.
SANTIAGO
(In Spanish)
Yes, it's full of Mexicans.
Amelia and Santiago look at each other and smile.
46
Mike and Debbie continue to gaze awestruck through the
windows. Santiago turns to them.
SANTIAGO
(In Spanish)
Are you hungry?
They both nod.
SANTIAGO (CONT'D)
Do you like popsicles?
Santiago pulls over next to some stalls, and the street
vendors run out to offer them their products.
48
Amelia is in a room with her two daughters standing in front
of a peeling and broken mirror putting on her violet gown.
One of her daughters helps her and pulls the zipper all the
way up.
DAUGHTER 1
(All in Spanish)
Oh ma, I don't know how you did it
but it zipped up perfectly.
AMELIA
And it's been 15 years since I last
wore this dress.
DAUGHTER 1
You haven't changed a bit, ma.
33.
AMELIA
Working, dear, working, that's what
keeps one young.
The two sisters realize that the dress has a hole just below
the seat, exchange looks and smile, which doesn't please
Amelia.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
What are you guys laughing about?
DAUGHTER 2
Nothing ma, nothing.
Amelia looks at them suspiciously, turns around and leaves
the room with her dress elegantly torn.
54
The bus rattles along. Richard huddles over Susan, trying to
stop the blood flowing from her neck. Barth, an old man starts
shouting.
BARTH
Marrakech isn't this way. They're
going to shoot at us again.
RICHARD
We've got to get her to a hospital.
BARTH
They're going to kill us all. Turn
back... turn the bus around...
Richard gets exasperated at the old man's screaming.
RICHARD
Shut up, god damn it!
Barth shuts up and the bus drives on.
58
The passengers sit quietly. As the ride gets bumpier, Susan
starts to cry out in pain.
SUSAN
It hurts, it hurts...
Richard tries to calm her down.
RICHARD
Easy, sweetie, easy...
SUSAN
It hurts... it hurts so much...
Richard turns her around and sees her shoulder has been
shattered. She won't stop shouting. A pool of blood starts
trickling down the aisle.
RICHARD
(A Anwar)
Isn't there anywhere else we can
take her?
36.
ANWAR
We can take her to my town. It's
near here and there's a doctor. In
the meantime we can call Erfourd for
an ambulance.
Richard turns to look at Susan, who is writhing in pain.
RICHARD
Ok.
ANWAR
(To the driver, in
Arabic)
Make a right onto the next road.
Richard and Anwar exchange a glance.
60
The bus' poor suspension gives the passengers a jolt.
Richard
tries to protect Susan's head.
62
Richard raises his head and sees the desolate environs.
RICHARD
Are we here?
ANWAR
Yes sir, this is my house.
Richard tries to carry Susan, but she screams in pain.
RICHARD
Easy, darling, easy...
He slips his hands under her and lifts her up.
SUSAN
Don't touch me there.
37.
Richard moves his hand, which is covered in blood. As he
carries her, he turns into the aisle while Anwar and one of
the passengers try to help him.
65
Anwar leads Richard down the hallways amidst Susan's screams.
67
An old woman (87), Anwar's grandmother, who has centuries of
desert in her expression, lets them in and points at a rug
on the floor.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER
(In Arabic)
Put her there...
Richard understands and softly lays Susan on the rug. Susan
looks around horrified: adobe walls, dirt floor: the epitome
of the third world.
RICHARD
I need to call an ambulance and
contact my embassy.
ANWAR
If you have the number of the embassy,
I can go call.
Obviously, Richard does not have it.
RICHARD
I need to make a phone call.
ANWAR
Of course, come with me.
They get ready to leave and Susan starts imploring.
SUSAN
Don't leave me here alone...
38.
RICHARD
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Susan looks desperate. To set Richard somewhat at ease,
Anwar points at his Grandmother.
ANWAR
She can take care of her.
Richard leans over Susan.
RICHARD
You're going to be ok.
Anwar kneels down next to her, takes a cloth and improvises
a tourniquet that he adjusts near her shoulder. He turns
towards the grandmother.
ANWAR
(In Arabic)
Hold and release the tourniquet every
once in a while.
The grandmother nods. She sees the swarm of kids looking
into the place and she shoos them away.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER
(In Arabic)
Get out of here... out...
The kids obey, except for one or two who take one last look
before they go. Susan's terrified eyes watch Anwar and Richard
leave the room.
69
Susan is lying on the floor, desolate. It seems as if the
pain is diminishing. The grandmother leans over her and softly
caresses her with her dirty, wrinkled hands. This startles
Susan.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER
(In Arabic)
How do you feel?
Susan is a little bit uncomfortable with her this close.
SUSAN
Can I have some water?
The old woman doesn't seem to understand. She grabs a basket
of dates and offers them to her. Susan shakes her head.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
No, water...
With her hand, Susan mimes drinking a glass of water. The
old woman seems to understand. She pours some water from a
jar, leans over her and helps her drink in small sips.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
Thanks.
The grandmother bows her head as if to say "your welcome."
SUSAN (CONT'D)
Where's my husband?
The old woman just smiles. Susan makes a gesture of
desperation. The grandmother leans over her, unfurls her
index finger and points at her heart.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER
(In Arabic)
Trust in god.
Susan keeps looking at her as she slowly gets up and goes to
sit in a chair.
41.
72
Richard is in a small cubicle dialing on an old cream-colored
rotary phone while Anwar waits discretely in a corner. Dozens
of people watch from outside. Richard turns to look at them
while the call connects.
RICHARD
Yes... Rachel? It's Richard...
RACHEL (O.S.)
Are you still in Moroccco?
RICHARD
Yes, we're still in Morocco...Rachel,
there was an accident, your sister
was shot...
RACHEL (O.S.)
(Surprised)
What? Who shot her?
RICHARD
I don't know... We were shot at from
some hills.
RACHEL
Is she ok?
RICHARD
She was hit in her neck and shoulder.
Rachel, she's not doing well... I
need you to tell the embassy as soon
as possible... wait... and call
Mark...
RACHEL (O.S.)
Where are you?
He turns to Anwar.
RICHARD
Anwar, where are we?
ANWAR
In Tazarine, three hours southwest
of Erfoud.
RICHARD
Were in Tazarine, T-a-z-a-r-I-n-e
Three hours southwest of Erfoud...
in the desert... it's a town...
there's no hospital... There's nothing
here at all...
RACHEL (O.S.)
Where are you calling me from?
42.
RICHARD
From a shop. Rachel, this is urgent...
urgent... call the embassy... They
have to help us... call James too...
RACHEL (O.S.)
Why did they shoot her?
RICHARD
I don't know... Rachel, you're
sister's badly hurt... do you
understand? Call for help... now...
He hangs up. As soon as he does, he turns to Anwar.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Call an ambulance...
ANWAR
I'll call Erfoud so they send one
over.
Anwar, clumsy and stressed at Richard's desperation, takes
the phone and starts dialing.
RICHARD
And find a doctor...
As he finishes dialing, Anwar turns to Richard.
ANWAR
They've already gone to look for
him.
73
Richard returns to the room. Susan, weak, lies with her
eyes open. The grandmother is tending to the wound, which
won't stop bleeding. She gets up and goes to Anwar.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER
(in Arabic)
Anwar, bring me some water.
74
Susan is lying down. A small pool of blood has collected
under her neck. She looks restless. She whispers weakly.
SUSAN
Get me out of here... please...
RICHARD
I'm going to as soon as I can. I've
already called Rachel; she's going
to tell the embassy.
SUSAN
I told you we shouldn't have come.
Just then Anwar enters. The grandmother takes the basin and
sets it in a corner. She gets some pieces of cloth and starts
to soak them.
RICHARD
How long until the ambulance gets
here?
ANWAR
About an hour and a half. It's coming
from Alnif.
RICHARD
That much? Isn't there anyone here
who could take her?
44.
Anwar shakes his head.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
We've got to get her out of here.
There's no one to tend to her.
ANWAR
My brother already called a doctor,
he's coming.
Richard is going to say something, but holds back.
His
despair and confusion are evident.
ANWAR (CONT'D)
Trust my grandmother; she knows a
lot about remedies.
The grandmother wrings out the rags and puts them on a table.
She takes some herbs, a fistful of earth from the floor and
she tosses them into the basin. She stirs it and pulls out
a clump of mud which she lays out on one of the pieces of
cloth.
Susan looks horrified at the dirt. The grandmother leans
over her and tries to clean the wound with the other moistened
rags. Susan resists.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER
(In Arabic)
I have to clean you.
ANWAR
(To Susan)
Miss, my grandmother is going to
help you.
The grandmother finishes cleaning her with the damp cloths
and grabs the clump of mud. She tries to put it on the wound,
but Susan flinches.
SUSAN
No, not that.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER
(In Arabic)
It will stop the bleeding.
SUSAN
No, no... not that...
Richard intervenes.
RICHARD
(To Anwar)
Let's wait for the doctor.
45.
76
Mohammed walks into the room and calls him.
MOHAMMED
(In Arabic)
The sheik and the moukadem are here.
78
Chieko is sitting in the reception area, waiting her turn.
There is a woman with a twelve year-old son listening to a
walkman and an old couple.
The receptionist (50) will not stop talking to the old lady.
48.
RECEPTIONIST
My niece sells these creams. And
just look at my skin now. I'm going
to turn fifty-two and look, almost
no wrinkles...
The woman continues her banal chatter. Chieko observes her
grotesque mouth. She then looks at the old man's bored face,
the old woman's feigned interest, the mother's annoyed
expression, and the boy, who rocks his head to the music.
A man walks out and the receptionist gestures at Chieko and
points toward the door.
81
The dentist (47) - tall and, unlike the receptionist, with
impeccable skin covering his hardened, attractive face -
examines Chieko's mouth. His face comes very close to hers
as he looks at her, making her nervous. The fat receptionist
walks in without knocking.
RECEPTIONIST
Here are the sterilized drill bits.
The dentist looks up at her. She leaves the drill bits on a
table and leaves. The dentist turns back to Chieko and speaks
face to face with her so she can read his lips.
DENTIST
I-think-you-have-two-cavities-in-
your-molars.
She smiles. The dentist moves closer to Chieko's mouth again;
she cannot stop looking at him.
Suddenly, Chieko licks his cheek. He is surprised, but
continues his checkup. She licks him again, this time on the
lips. He pulls away, flustered.
DENTIST (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
She grabs his hand, puts it on her inner thigh and rubs it
against her pubis.
He, confused, tries to pull his hand away, but she prevents
him from doing so. The scene starts to turn slightly
grotesque. After a slight struggle, he pulls his hand back.
DENTIST (CONT'D)
What's the matter with you?
She grabs his hand again and, again, pulls it toward her
pubis. He gets angry and moves back. The fat woman enters
again without knocking, sees they are agitated and, without
a word, walks out and closes the door.
49.
The dentist turns toward Chieko.
DENTIST (CONT'D)
Get out.
She shakes her head. She is excited, anxious, scared,
fragile. He pulls her by her wrist out of the chair.
DENTIST (CONT'D)
Get out right now.
He walks to the door and opens it. Just before she walks
out, Chieko draws out a slight smile, which is almost a grin.
82
Chieko enters the lobby. Beside the doorman are two men
dressed in suits: Kenji (31) and Hamano (50). The janitor
gestures at Chieko with his chin. The men walk over toward
her and cut her off.
HAMANO
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?
Chieko doesn't manage to read his lips. She is silent. The
doorman notices the situation, walks out from behind his
small desk and shouts at the men.
DOORMAN
She's deaf mute. Face her when you
speak so she can read your lips.
Kenji and Hamano are disconcerted. Hamano stands squarely
in front of her and speaks slowly, emphasizing every word.
HAMANO
Are-you-Yasujiro-Wataya's-daughter?
She nods.
HAMANO (CONT'D)
We-are-sargeants-Kenji-Mamiya-and-
Hamano-Kanoo-of-the-Tokyo-police.
We-need-to-find-your-father.
She pulls out a pen and a piece of paper from her bag.
She
scrawls a few lines and hands them over.
50.
Hamano reads it and turns his face toward hers.
HAMANO (CONT'D)
No, he didn't do anything wrong. We
just want to talk to him. Do you
know where he is?
She shrugs her shoulders. Kenji gives her his card. Upon
receiving it, Chieko turns to look at him. Their eyes meet
and she looks down. She then looks up again, blushing.
KENJI
Tell him to call us. And don't be
scared, we're not going to do anything
bad to him.
HAMANO
Thank you.
Chieko can't stop staring at Kenji. The two cops leave.
As
soon as they do, Chieko heads toward the elevator.
85
Chieko walks into the apartment. It is a large apartment,
elegantly furnished. Although decoration is scant, some
hunting trophies stand out: a scimitar-horned Oryx, sheep,
and others. There are also photographs of Yasujiro hunting.
A wall is dedicated to family photos. Among them is a picture
of Chieko as a little girl with her father and her mother.
Chieko sees a note on the table at the entrance. She puts
the policeman's card down and picks up a note from her father
that says: "I waited until five and you didn't make it.
I've got a meeting and I'll be back late. I left you some
soup and some chicken for dinner. Kisses. Papa."
86
Chieko sits in front of a mute T.V., channel surfing.
She
stops at a fashion show, then some cartoons.
Suddenly, on a news program, we see the photographs of Ahmed
and Yussef. Chieko looks at them for a moment and then
changes the channel. She is watching T.V. when a red bulb,
set between a yellow bulb and a blue one, starts to light up
insistently as the doorbell rings.
Chieko notices and shuts off the T.V.
87
Chieko opens the door and Mitsu walks in. They greet each
other with a handshake where they end up touching their index
fingers to each other's hearts.
51.
MITSU
Are you ready?
CHIEKO
Yeah, I'm just going to get my bag.
Chieko goes to get her bag. Mitsu sees the policeman's card
on the entrance table and looks at it. Chieko comes back
and Mitsu asks her about it in sign language.
MITSU
The cops came again?
CHIEKO
Yeah. They hadn't come in nine
months. But these were different
cops.
MITSU
Did they come to ask about your
mothers' death?
CHIEKO
No, but they're probably going to
ask my dad about the same things.
MITSU
They're just not convinced, are they?
Chieko shakes her head, remains pensive and then smiles.
CHIEKO
Believe it or not, I liked one of
the cops.
Chieko puts Kenji's card in her purse.
MITSU
Did you put on some panties?
Chieko smiles, lifts up her skirt and exposes her naked pubis.
Mitsu lifts hers up as well and is also without panties.
They laugh and leave the apartment.
88
nside the house, Amelia is checking on the food.
AMELIA
(All in Spanish)
How many pots of rice did you make?
DAUGHTER 1
I made two.
Amelia looks out the window and sees the vast amount of guests
that have arrived and which have transformed the hamlet into
a large parking lot of trucks, horses, carts, etc.
AMELIA
Too many people have come, that's
not going to be enough. Make two
more pots.
She turns to another of her daughters.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
And you Maria Eugenia, warm up more
tortillas.
She sees Santiago walk past the window.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Santiago... please go kill another
six chickens, or there won't be enough
food.
Santiago stops and looks through the window.
SANTIAGO
Sure thing.
Out back, Santiago sees a car arrive.
A priest steps out.
100
Luis drives while Amelia looks out the window.
AMELIA
(Both in Spanish)
Did you get into a fight with
Patricia?
LUIS
No, not at all.
AMELIA
I didn't bust my hump to pay for
this wedding for Patricia not to
show. So she's either coming or
she's coming.
105
Luis honks the horn.
Nobody shows.
AMELIA
I'm going to see if they're inside.
108
Patricia, in her bridal dress and clearly six months pregnant,
is sitting on her bed with her hands around her belly, with
her mother, father and entire family around her.
62.
PATRICIA
(Both in Spanish)
My belly's been hard since the
morning.
AMELIA
That happens when you're nervous.
MADRE
D'you think the baby's coming?
AMELIA
There's no way the baby's coming;
she's only six months pregnant.
PATRICIA
But my belly feels hard, really hard.
AMELIA
D'you want to get married?
PATRICIA
Yes.
AMELIA
Well, let's go then.
MADRE
And what if the baby comes out?
AMELIA
Well, we'll have the wedding and
baptize the kid while we're at it.
111
Susan is lying on the floor, moaning softly. Flies hover
around the pool of blood under her neck. Richard, worried,
strokes her hair.
The grandmother brings them a pot of tea with two cups and
sets them on the floor beside them.
RICHARD
Thank you.
The grandmother goes to sit in a chair. Mohammed walks in
and whispers something to him. Anwar turns to Richard.
63.
ANWAR
The doctor's here.
113
The doctor enters the room.
DOCTOR
(In Arabic)
Allah be with you.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER
(In Arabic)
Allah be with you.
Richard just bows his head slightly. The doctor walks over
to Susan, shoos the flies away and examines the wound. She
looks at him, anxious.
DOCTOR
(In Arabic)
The bullet didn't hit her spine or
split her jugular. But it did shatter
her clavicle and she could bleed to
death.
Anwar looks worried.
RICHARD
What did he say?
ANWAR
He says she will be fine.
RICHARD
Stop lying to me god damn it, and
tell me what the fuck he said!
The doctor addresses Richard in terrible English.
DOCTOR
Hospital... need hospital...
RICHARD
Yes, we know that. What can you do
in the meantime?
DOCTOR
(In Arabic, to Anwar)
Tell him I have to stitch up the
wound to stop the bleeding.
64.
Anwar draws close to Richard and whispers.
ANWAR
He has to sew up her wounds.
Susan turns to look at them, suspicious.
SUSAN
What did he say?
Richard gets nervous.
RICHARD
You need some stitches.
SUSAN
What do you mean stitches?
The doctor opens his kit and takes out a rudimentary needle
and thread. He gets ready to sew. Richard questions him,
also in whispers.
RICHARD
You're not going to give her any
anesthetic?
The doctor and Anwar exchange a look.
ANWAR
(To Richard)
No, he doesn't use anesthetic.
RICHARD
What kind of doctor is he?
Anwar answers naively, in a low voice.
ANWAR
He's a veterinarian, but he is good.
Richard looks at him, surprised and angry.
RICHARD
He can't take care of her.
SUSAN
Richard, he might infect the wound...
Richard can't answer as he focuses on what the doctor says.
DOCTOR
(In Arabic)
Tell him that if I don't stitch up
her wound she may bleed to death.
65.
ANWAR
If he doesn't sew up the wound, she
may bleed to death.
DOCTOR
(In Arabic, to Anwar)
And tell him her clavicle is broken.
We have to fasten a splint to it.
ANWAR
He says she has a broken bone and he
has to put a splint on it.
Richard remains pensive for a moment. He looks at Susan,
then at the doctor and assents tentatively.
DOCTOR
(In Arabic)
We're going to have to hold her down.
He mimes holding her down with his hands. Richard leans over
Susan, who weakly languishes on the rug.
RICHARD
Honey, this is going to hurt a little.
She stares at him. Richard turns to Anwar and signals that
he can begin. Anwar holds her hands. Susan, stupefied, to
Richard.
SUSAN
Richard, don't let him...
The doctor lifts Susan's neck and starts to stitch.
She
howls in pain and tries to move away.
Anwar and Richard hold Susan down.
The doctor sticks the
needle in again.
Susan shakes her head from side to side trying to pull away.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
Don't let him, don't let him.
RICHARD
Calm down... calm down... Susan,
they have to sew you up... relax...
Richard holds her head to keep her still. She resists.
SUSAN
No, no...no..
RICHARD
Honey, please try to relax...
66.
The doctor rubs alcohol on the wound and starts to stitch.
She moans in pain. Richard puts a rag in her mouth, on which
she bites down.
115
Susan lies on the floor with her neck shoddily stitched and
a splint on her shoulder made out of a few sticks and some
dirty bandages. She moans in pain and mumbles curses.
SUSAN
I hate you... I hate you...
She tries to stand, but the doctor impedes it.
DOCTOR
(To Anwar in Arabic)
Tell her not to move; the bullet's
still inside.
68.
ANWAR
(To Susan)
Don't move, miss. The bullet is still
inside you.
SUSAN
I don't give a shit...
RICHARD
My love, don't move.
SUSAN
I want to call the kids.
RICHARD
You can't move, calm down.
SUSAN
I want to talk to them.
RICHARD
You can't; there's only one phone in
town. I'll call them later.
She seems obsessed by the idea.
SUSAN
I want to talk to them...
She tries to stand again. As they struggle, the grandmother
takes out a hash pipe form a drawer and lights it. She gives
it two drags and squats next to Susan.
She shows her how to smoke it and hands it over. The old
woman's serenity is such that Susan acquiesces. She takes
four drags and slowly starts to relax.
Susan smokes another three times, relaxes and closes her
eyes. The old woman goes to get the clump of mud and starts
to spread it on Susan's neck. Susan does not protest.
Richard watches the scene in awe.
117
The driver sits in the driver's seat and stares out at the
desolate landscape through the windshield.
Several of the tourists nap in their seats. One of them, a
French tourist, Robert (70), starts to breathe with
difficulty. Jane (65), his wife, is alarmed.
69.
JANE
(In French)
Are you ok?
Robert nods, but it is clear that he is not.
Jane shouts at
the driver.
JANE (CONT'D)
(In French)
Could you please turn on the air
conditioning?
The driver shakes his head regretfully.
DRIVER
(In broken French)
No air condition, no gasoline near.
I'm sorry.
Robert inhales, he can barely breathe.
JANE
(In French)
My husband is feeling ill.
You have
to turn it on.
DRIVER
(In French)
No possible. No gasoline near.
I'm
sorry.
LILLY
(In French)
Please, it's too hot.
We can get
dehydrated.
DRIVER
(In French)
I'm really sorry, forgive me, but
gasoline finish with air conditioner.
Tom turns to Jane.
TOM
What is he saying?
JANE
That he can't turn on the air
conditioning, that it's not possible.
Tom stands up and goes to yell at the driver.
TOM
Fuck you.
We're gettin' out of here.
70.
119
Richard is looking out the window while Susan, relaxed,
sleeps. Tom and James walk in making noise.
TOM
We've gotta talk to you.
Richard, with his index finger, signals for him to shut up
and points at Susan. He gestures for them to leave the room.
121
Night begins to fall. Haruki sits between Mitsu and Chieko.
He strokes Chieko's knee with his hand; she seems turned on.
126
They enter. The music, the light, the crowd, it is almost
hallucinatory. For Chieko, it is a silent concert of movement
and chaos.
She and her friends push their way through the place. Haruki
grabs Chieko by the hand, pulls her toward the floor and
starts dancing. Chieko looks at the other dancers' rhythm
and follows. She slowly manages to follow.
The other deaf-mutes also dance. Some do better than others,
lost in the sea of lights and people.
For Chieko, the dance turns into something hypnotic. She
dances with her eyes closed, concentrated on her own rhythm.
When she opens her eyes, she sees that Mitsu, a little drunk,
is grinding against Haruki, feeling him up.
Chieko seems annoyed by this and goes to defend her territory.
She starts dancing next to Haruki, but she is constantly
interrupted by the surrounding crowd.
The struggle between Chieko and Mitsu is a little bit
ridiculous. It is finally resolved when Mitsu takes Haruki
by the face and starts to kiss him. Chieko doesn't know what
to do. Mitsu and Haruki start to make out intensely.
Suddenly Chieko is left standing in the middle of the club,
motionless, while her friends dance awkwardly and Mitsu and
Haruki are having the time of their lives. Chieko, defeated
by her friend, decides to leave. Mitsu spots her out of the
corner of her eye and waves goodbye. Chieko smiles back and
walks away from her friends as they dance.
128
Chieko enters her building and goes straight to the doorman.
DOORMAN
Good evening, how may I help you?
Chieko takes out a piece of paper and a pen from her purse
and writes a note. She gives it to the doorman together
with Kenji's card. He reads it carefully, and when he's
done he turns to her.
74.
DOORMAN (CONT'D)
Very well miss, I'll call him now.
The doorman picks up a cordless phone and dials.
DOORMAN (CONT'D)
Lieutenant Kenji Mamiya, please?
There is a pause. The doorman gestures to Chieko that the
lieutenant will answer in a moment.
DOORMAN (CONT'D)
Lieutenant? Yes, look, I'm with the
deaf-mute girl you saw in the
afternoon, and she asked me to call
you... Yes, her... She says she needs
to talk to you, alone... about her
father... If it's possible, in her
apartment, tonight.
Chieko watches attentively.
129
Hassan's wife gives directions.
WIFE
Make a right here.
Alarid, with his hand, signals the driver to follow her
directions.
Suddenly, in the distance, over the hills, she signals three
tiny dots running up a slope.
WIFE (CONT'D)
That's them.
77.
ALARID
(To the driver)
Stop...
The trucks stop and Alarid takes out his binoculars.
135
P.O.V. ALARID'S BINOCULARS -- CONTINUOUS
In the distance, we can still see Abdullah, Yussef and Ahmed
run across the hills. Abdullah is clearly carrying the rifle.
136
Santiago drives the car, nodding off every now and then. In
the back, Debbie and Mike have surrendered to sleep. Santiago
jerks the wheel.
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Hey... be careful...
Santiago corrects the vehicles trajectory and goes back to
his careless driving.
146
Nervous, Santiago glances ahead and looks at the border
crossing through his rear-view mirror. He puts the car in
reverse and accelerates, trying to escape back to Mexico,
but he crashes into an arriving car.
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
What are you doing?
149
Santiago drives madly. Frightened, Amelia holds onto the
dashboard. Debbie and Mike start to cry.
85.
SANTIAGO
(In Spanish)
See, I told you you shouldn't have
brought them. I told you. I told
you..
A trailer drives slowly. Santiago decides to drive around
it blindly, and almost drives off the other side of the road.
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Santiago, stop acting crazy and stop
the car... Santiago, stop...
Santiago ignores her, concentrated on his driving. He looks
through the rear-view mirror. There is nobody behind him,
only the dark highway. Santiago steps on the gas.
Amelia tries to comfort the kids.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
(In English)
Everything's all right sweeties...
The children won't stop crying, terrified by the speed.
Through one of his mirrors, Santiago sees two patrol cars
following him with their turrets flashing.
SANTIAGO
(In Spanish)
Fucking asshole gringo mother-fuckers,
here they come...
Santiago accelerates. The car seems to be out of control.
The children scream. Amelia tries to stop Santiago.
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Stop... Stop...
Santiago reaches a path and heads toward it.
152
Santiago turns to Amelia.
SANTIAGO
(Their entire dialogue
in Spanish)
Get out...
86.
Amelia looks at the dark desert surrounding them.
AMELIA
Are you crazy? Where?
SANTIAGO
Get out. I'll lose these bastards
and then I'll come back for you.
AMELIA
Santiago, calm down...
SANTIAGO
Aunt Amelia, they're going to get
us, get out god damn it...
154
Dusk. Susan sleeps and Richard looks at the vast desert
through the window. Anwar, sitting on a chair, with a fan
clears away the flies hovering around Susan. We can hear the
call to prayer and Anwar prostrates himself toward Mecca.
Richard observes Anwar's prayer and then looks at Susan who
moans in her sleep.
156
Richard and Anwar are sitting in silence while Susan lies
unconsciously on the floor.
Yamil (9), a beautiful girl with large brown eyes, enters
carrying a tray with cookies and tea. She greets Richard
with a nod and offers him tea.
Richard takes the tea.
RICHARD
Thank you.
The girl gets up to offer tea to Anwar, who takes it.
ANWAR
(In Arabic)
Thank you, Yamil.
Yamil smiles and leaves the room.
RICHARD
Is that your daughter?
88.
ANWAR
The fourth of eight.
RICHARD
Eight?
Anwar affirms, smiling.
ANWAR
Do you have kids?
Richard takes out his wallet and pulls out a photo of him,
Susan, Mike and Debbie. He shows it to him.
Anwar takes it and looks at it.
ANWAR (CONT'D)
Just two?
RICHARD
Three...
(He remains pensive)
Yes, just two.
ANWAR
You should have more.
Anwar returns the photo. Richard looks at it for a moment
before putting it back into his wallet.
RICHARD
What about you? How many wives do
you have?
ANWAR
(Smiling)
I can only afford one.
RICHARD
And is this where you live?
ANWAR
No, this is where my family lives. I
live in Marrakesh. But I come whenever
I can...
They exchange a look. We hear a car engine.
157
Richard is in the phone booth with telephone in hand. A
woman's voice answers.
RACHEL (O.S.)
Hello...
RICHARD
Rachel... What's going on? Nobody's
come... Who have you talked to... we
need help...she's dying...
RACHEL (O.S.)
What d'you mean dying?
RICHARD
She's very weak, please, you've got
to do something.
RACHEL (O.S.)
Mark, your business partner, already
called someone in the Secretary of
State, they're going to help you...
RICHARD
You can't just make these stupid
fucking calls, you've got to do
something...
RACHEL (O.S.)
Richard calm down, we're doing
everything we can.
93.
RICHARD
How the fuck do you expect me to
calm down? Susan is dying...
RACHEL (O.S.)
I'm flying over there tonight.
RICHARD
There's no time. I need to get Susan
out of here now! Put Mark on the
phone...
RACHEL (O.S.)
I don't know if I can find him.
RICHARD
God damn it, connect the fucking
call.
A few seconds go by. Desperate, Richard looks at the town as
it goes about its daily business, oblivious to his tragedy.
MARK (O.S.)
Richard, it's Mark.
RICHARD
Mark, help me... Susan is dying and
there are no ambulances, there's no
hospital, there's nothing.
MARK (O.S.)
Richard, the news is all over the
place. They're going to go help you,
soon, but there have been some
political problems that are being
resolved.
RICHARD
I don't give a shit about political
problems... Do something, now,
please...
Through the window, Richard, astonished, watches the bus
drive away, kicking up dust as it disappears in the distance.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Son of a bitch...
He throws the phone away and runs after the bus. We hear
Mark's desperate voice over the receiver.
MARK (O.S.)
Richard... what happened? Richard,
answer me...
94.
160
Chieko is in her room, sitting on her bed, staring into space.
The doorbell light goes on. She remains motionless for a
few moments. The light goes on again. Chieko breathes in
and goes to open the door.
162
Chieko opens the door and runs into Kenji, who greets her as
if she were just anybody.
KENJI
Hello.
She bows.
KENJI (CONT'D)
They told me you wanted to talk to
me.
Chieko, who has been unable to read his lips, asks him with
her hands that he speak slowly and face her. Kenji is
embarrassed by his tactlessness and tries to be more
considerate.
KENJI (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. Is there something you
wanted to tell me?
Chieko nods and asks him in with her hand. Kenji takes off
his shoes and leaves them at the door. Chieko leads him to
the living room and with a gesture asks if he wants anything
to drink.
KENJI (CONT'D)
Do you have tea?
Chieko nods and goes into the kitchen. Kenji glances over
the apartment. Chieko comes back from the kitchen holding a
strange gadget which she puts on the living room table. A
small bulb lights. Kenji just watches her.
Chieko gestures for him to sit down.
Kenji and Chieko sit
across from each other.
95.
Chieko takes out her notebook and pen, writes something down
and hands it over to Kenji. Kenji reads, seems surprised
and reads again slowly.
KENJI (CONT'D)
"My father had nothing to do with my
mother's death," what's this?
Chieko is disconcerted at the question. She takes her
notebook and starts writing. Kenji reads and turns to her.
KENJI (CONT'D)
Your father was asleep when she jumped
off the balcony?
She nods. She gets up, asks Kenji to go with her and walks
toward the balcony.
163
Kenji stands and looks at the photographs of Yasujiro hunting
all over the world: with a kudu in Africa, a black bear in
Kamchatka, Hassan and the Oryx in Morocco.
96.
Chieko comes back with a cup of steaming tea.
KENJI
Does your father still hunt?
She shakes her head.
She writes something and hands it over.
KENJI (CONT'D)
There was an incident with a rifle
in your father's name. That's why
we want to talk to him.
The news weighs on Chieko; she looks away. The sounds of
Tokyo come in through the living room: its car horns, its
voices.
Suddenly a rush of wind comes in. Chieko sees the balcony
doors are open and goes to close them. She then comes back
to the living room and sits down, dejected.
Kenji sits down beside her and leaves the tea on the table.
He doesn't know what to do and looks uncomfortable.
She picks up the notebook and writes.
Kenji reads.
KENJI (CONT'D)
No, your father isn't going to jail.
We just need to talk to him.
There is a long silence. Chieko seems immersed in a remote,
inaccessible world. Kenji turns his face to hers so that
she can read his lips.
KENJI (CONT'D)
I have to go now. Thank you.
Chieko grabs his arm and shakes her head, urging him to stay.
They exchange a look for an instant and Kenji insists.
KENJI (CONT'D)
I have to go.
He gets up to leave. Chieko signals for him to wait for a
moment and goes to her room.
Kenji stands in the middle of the room, waiting.
Chieko
comes back completely naked. Her skin bristles.
She walks toward him, breathing through her mouth. Kenji is
disconcerted when he sees the quiet teenager approach. She
walks all the way up to Kenji and when she is about to take
another step, he holds her back with both hands.
KENJI (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
97.
She doesn't pay attention, breaks free and stands a few inches
away from him. She is almost panting. She holds out her
hand and caresses Kenji's ear. He stands there, immobile,
without taking his eyes off Chieko's.
She takes his hand and puts it on one of her breasts. Kenji
strokes her breast and then pulls his hand away. She grabs
it again and puts it back on.
KENJI (CONT'D)
No, no, no... this is wrong.
Kenji looks turned on and confused: Chieko is beautiful, but
he knows he cannot go on and takes his hand away.
KENJI (CONT'D)
No, I can't.
You're just a girl.
She walks up to his face and licks it.
He is confused.
KENJI (CONT'D)
Enough, please.
He grabs her by her arms and moves her away. She grabs the
sleeve of his jacket and pulls him back. She hugs him and
suddenly Chieko starts crying, disconsolate.
Kenji, bewildered, first does nothing, but upon seeing
Chieko's despair, holds her. She buries her face in his
shoulder. Her nakedness becomes increasingly fragile.

Amelia, cuffed, and John, drive down a path in the desert.
JOHN
Which way are they?
Amelia studies the terrain.
She points at some mesquites in
the distance.
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Over there.
177
Night begins to fall. From the window we can hear the noises
of the town: voices, goats bleating, camels moaning, music
from a radio.
Susan wakes from her slumber and turns to Richard, who is
leaning on a wall, tired, sweaty, with his eyes closed.
SUSAN
Richard.
RICHARD
What do you need?
SUSAN
Richard... if I die, take care of
the kids. Especially Mike, he really
needs you.
RICHARD
You're not going to die. You can't
die. You just can't.
SUSAN
Don't ever leave them again.
RICHARD
No, I'm not going to leave them and
don't you even think about leaving
me, because I'll kill you like
nobody's killed you before.
She smiles.
He caresses her.
SUSAN
I peed my pants.
RICHARD
What?
108.
SUSAN
I couldn't hold it in and I peed.
Richard touches between her legs and feels the moisture.
RICHARD
I'm going to tell Mike on you, so
you never scold him again.
They both laugh.
She grimaces in pain when she does.
SUSAN
I need to pee again.
RICHARD
(To Anwar)
Do you have a pot I can borrow?
Anwar looks in a corner and hands it over.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
(To Anwar)
Can you leave us alone for a moment?
The grandmother and Anwar exit.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Come, try it like this.
He lifts up her dress, pulls down her underpants and sets
the basin under her. She puts her arm around him to pull
herself up, but can't move her right arm.
SUSAN
I can't.
They laugh.
He kisses her.
We start to hear the stream.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
Now I can.
While she pees, they kiss painfully.
She starts to cry.
RICHARD
Forgive me my love. When Pat died I
didn't know what to do, the pain
drove me crazy... I was scared, that's
why I left... forgive me.
SUSAN
I was scared too... when I saw Pat
lying still in his crib...
Her voice breaks up and she can barely go on.
109.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
It wasn't my fault, it wasn't... I
couldn't do anything for him...
RICHARD
No, it wasn't your fault. I was
wrong...
He strokes her head.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Shhh... it wasn't your fault my love,
it wasn't anybody's fault... Pat
just left...
(A beat)
Forgive me, please.
SUSAN
Forgive me for not forgiving you.
Richard hugs her and starts to laugh.
RICHARD
You missed; you got my leg.
They both laugh, and as they do, the blanket covering Susan's
wound slips off. Richard sees her swollen, bruised arm. He
touches it.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Does it hurt?
SUSAN
So much... so much...
Richard looks worried and leaves the room.
180
Richard is squatting next to Susan.
RICHARD
My love... I'm going to get you out
of here.
We're going to try to
take you to a clinic an hour and a
half away from here. Do you think
you can make it?
She thinks for a moment and then nods.
SUSAN
Yeah.
RICHARD
I need you to be strong. Really
strong.
Susan sighs: the effort required seems as if it will be too
much, but she nods again. Richard hugs and kisses her.
182
Richard walks into the cubicle.
The phone is off the hook
and Richard answers.
RICHARD
Hello...
SECRETARY (O.S.)
Just a moment, I'm going to put you
through to ambassador Ken Clifford.
Richard awaits. In the corner of the room, he sees a goat's
head covered with flies.
KEN
Hello, Richard Jones?
RICHARD
Yes, speaking.
KEN (O.S.)
I'm very sorry about what happened
to your wife, but you can be sure
that the culprits will be punished.
RICHARD
My wife is dying. She's in urgent
need of medical attention.
KEN (O.S.)
We're working on it...
112.
Richard interrupts angrily.
RICHARD
We've been here for five hours.
What the fuck are you waiting for?
KEN (O.S.)
The Moroccan government won't let us
use their airspace. They refused to
acknowledge that this was an act of
terrorism...
RICHARD
I can't wait anymore... I'm taking
my wife to a clinic in Tinerhir right
now...
KEN (O.S.)
Stay put... we've settled the matter.
A helicopter should arrive soon...
RICHARD
We can't wait any longer.
KEN (O.S.)
The helicopter is on its way. Don't
move.
RICHARD
My wife is in critical condition.
How long is the chopper going to
take?
KEN (O.S.)
Soon... it'll be there soon... Be
patient, it won't be long.
184
Amelia sits in a room painted white. An American, his hair
slicked back, dressed in a shirt and tie, sits before her.
POLICE OFFICER
(In Spanish)
Is your full name Amelia Gloria Jordn
Susilla?
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Yes sir.
POLICE OFFICER
Do you understand English?
AMELIA
(In English)
Yes sir.
113.
POLICE OFFICER
(In English)
Ma'am, it was a miracle that we found
those kids. I don't know how you
could leave them alone in the desert.
AMELIA
I had to look for help.
POLICE OFFICER
Your reckless behavior endangered
their lives.
Amelia stops arguing.
She looks worried.
AMELIA
How are they?
POLICE OFFICER
That's none of your business, ma'am.
The man's words hurt Amelia, who looks away to avoid crying.
POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
You've committed serious crimes.
AMELIA
I just took the kids to my son's
wedding.
POLICE OFFICER
No ma'am, you did not just do that.
You took them to another country
without their parents' permission
and you put them in danger.
AMELIA
Sir, I raised these kids since they
were born. I take care of them day
and night. I feed them breakfast,
lunch and dinner. I play with them.
Mike and Debbie are like my own
children.
POLICE OFFICER
(sternly)
But they are not your kids, ma'am.
AMELIA
What about my nephew, Santiago?
POLICE OFFICER
I don't have any information on him.
Amelia looks destitute.
114.
POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
We located the parents in Morocco.
They're very angry, but they've
decided not to raise charges.
Amelia exhales, relieved.
The policeman leans toward her.
POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
Nevertheless, the government of the
United States has deemed you were
seriously breaking the law and has
decided to immediately and
definitively deport you.
Amelia loses her breath.
AMELIA
I've been living here for fifteen
years. My things are here, I rent a
house, I made my life here.
POLICE OFFICER
You should've thought of that
beforehand.
AMELIA
I want to talk to a lawyer.
POLICE OFFICER
If you attempt to take this to court,
I assure you you will end up in jail.
If you want my advice, accept the
deportation and never come back.
185
Several Moroccan doctors are examining Susan.
Richard
observes worriedly from a window.
One of the doctors comes out.
MOROCCAN DOCTOR
(In good English)
We're going to have to operate
immediately.
RICHARD
Is she going to be ok?
MOROCCAN DOCTOR
It's probable. We're going to try to
save her arm.
She's been bleeding
internally, and there's been some
clotting so there's a high risk of
gangrene.
RICHARD
(insistently, as if
he hadn't heard the
doctor)
But she's going to be ok?
The Moroccan doctor puts his hand on Richard's shoulder and
thinks about his answer.
MOROCCAN DOCTOR
Yes, she's going to be ok.
The doctor leaves and Richard goes back to looking at his
wife through the glass.
The doctors are still prepping her.
Richard walks in.
193
He stands next to Susan, who is unconscious. He looks at a
doctor and she moves to one side. Richard leans over and
kisses her.
He walks away and the nurses start to wheel her to the O.R.
194
Richard is talking on the phone from an office.
118.
RICHARD
Amelia?
AMELIA (O.S.)
Yes sir.
RICHARD
How is everything?
AMELIA (O.S.)
Ok sir, Mrs. Rachel told me. I'm
very sorry. How is Mrs. Susan?
RICHARD
They're going to operate now...
Amelia... take good care of the kids,
and don't tell them anything...
AMELIA (O.S.)
No sir, don't worry.
RICHARD
Put Mike on please.
A few seconds pass and Mike answers.
This is the phone call
from the beginning.
MIKE (O.S.)
Hi dad.
RICHARD
Hey sweetie, how are you?
MIKE (O.S.)
Dad, guess what? Today, at school,
they brought some baby chickens.
RICHARD
Oh really?
MIKE (O.S.)
I held one in my hand. He was really
little and he was all warm.
Richard starts to cry for the first time.
MIKE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Dad, are you ok?
Richard tries to hold back his sobbing.
RICHARD
Yeah, I'm ok. Everything's fine.
The boy keeps talking while Richard cries.
119.
MIKE (O.S.)
And Mariana wanted to take one home,
but the teacher didn't let her...
195
Chieko, naked, sits in an armchair, again submerged in the
remote world of her silence. Before her, Kenji observes her
nakedness, her sadness, her pained beauty.
For a while they remain motionless. She seems to return
from the long journey to herself and turns to look at him.
Their eyes meet. There are still tears in Chieko's eyes.
They hold each other's gaze until Chieko gets up, gets her
notebook, scribbles down some words and gives them to him.
Kenji reads them and looks at her.
KENJI
You don't have to apologize for
anything.
She sits down beside him. They look at each other again for
a few, long seconds. Chieko takes his hand, strokes it for a
moment, kisses it, sucks one of his fingers and then puts it
back in its place.
She grabs her notebook and starts writing a long note. It
takes her almost a minute to do so. Kenji, nervous because
of her proximity, watches her write feverishly.
Chieko finishes writing, folds the note and hands it to Kenji.
Kenji starts unfolding it, but Chieko stops him. She takes
it away from him, folds it again and puts it in his breast
pocket. She signals for him to read it later.
Kenji gets up to go. She stands next to him. Her nakedness
contrasts with Kenji's toughness. He bows his head to say
goodbye and she moves aside for him to pass. Kenji walks
past her as she watches.
Kenji reaches the door. He opens it and turns to look at
Chieko again, who has been left in the middle of the hall.
He bows his head again and leaves.
Chieko watches him leave and closes her eyes painfully.
196
Kenji rides the elevator down, touched, barely able to contain
his emotion. The elevator doors open and he walks out.
197
Kenji walks past the doorman.
120.
KENJI
Good night.
He keeps walking. On the other end of the lobby, at the
parking lot entrance, Yasujiro walks in.
The doorman calls Kenji as he is about to leave.
DOORMAN
Officer... officer...
Kenji stops.
Beside him is Yasujiro.
DOORMAN (CONT'D)
This is the man you were looking
for.
Kenji approaches him while the doorman discretely moves away
to leave them alone in the lobby.
KENJI
Good evening, I'm lieutenant Mamiya.
YASUJIRO
Good evening, how can I help you?
KENJI
Sir, there was an incident and...
Yasujiro looks at him attentively. Kenji, still moved by
Chieko, looks distracted, confused.
KENJI (CONT'D)
I don't mean to bother you, but...
(a beat)
Do you own a .270 caliber Winchester
70 rifle with the registration
number...
Kenji looks through his pockets, takes out a small notebook
and looks up the missing number.
KENJI (CONT'D)
UK-9023?
YASUJIRO
I don't remember the license, but I
did have a rifle like the one you
described.
KENJI
Is it true that you gave it to a Mr.
Hassan Ibrahim, who lives in southern
Morocco?
YASUJIRO
Hassan Ibrahim?
121.
KENJI
He says he was your guide in a hunt.
YASUJIRO
Hassan? Of course. He was a very
good guide and I gave him the rifle.
Hassan is a very kind man. Did
anything happen?
KENJI
There was an attempted murder with
that rifle, and the Moroccan police
want to confirm it's not off the
black market.
YASUJIRO
No, I gave it to him.
(a beat)
Is Hassan ok?
KENJI
I don't know.
Yasujiro remains silent for a moment.
YASUJIRO
Am I legally involved?
KENJI
Not for the moment. You may have to
go testify for your friend.
YASUJIRO
Can I leave now?
KENJI
Good night.
They both bow to say goodbye. Yasujiro walks toward the
elevator. Kenji calls out to him.
KENJI (CONT'D)
Excuse me.
Kenji approaches and Yasujiro awaits, expectant.
KENJI (CONT'D)
Your daughter told me about your
wife on the balcony. I'm very sorry.
YASUJIRO
What balcony?
KENJI
About how your wife killed herself
by jumping off the balcony.
122.
YASUJIRO
My wife never jumped off a balcony.
She shot herself in the head. My
daughter was the first to find her.
Kenji is left speechless.
YASUJIRO (CONT'D)
I've explained it to the police
several times. Don't bother us with
that anymore, please.
KENJI
I'm very sorry sir, we won't bother
you anymore. Good night.
He turns around and leaves the building.
198
Kenji sits in a half-empty bar.
He turns to the bartender.
KENJI
Another whisky.
The T.V. has been turned on to a Japanese newscast. Kenji
takes out Chieko's note, reads it and, as soon as he is done,
closes his eyes. He looks around. Everybody seems to be
immersed in a world far from his own.
A reporter appears on T.V.
REPORTER
Susan Jones, the American woman
wounded in an attack in Morocco ten
days ago, left the hospital today,
heading to the United States...
Susan appears on screen in a wheelchair pushed by a male
nurse and followed by Richard.
The bartender leans over to Kenji.
BARTENDER
Do you want something to eat?
I
could make you a sandwich.
KENJI
No thank you.
When he looks back at the news, the story has changed.
Kenji
drinks his whisky parsimoniously.
123.
200
Yasujiro rides the elevator up, lost in thought.
201
