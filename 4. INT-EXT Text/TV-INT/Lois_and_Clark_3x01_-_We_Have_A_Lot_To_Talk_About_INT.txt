      carrying an overnight bag.

      BILL, SR. appears.  He embraces Bill, Jr. This comes as a 
      surprise to the younger Church and he returns the affection 
      stiffly.

                     waste.  The money, the power.  It's 
                     meaningless.  We're gonna pull the

                     wanted to keep an eye on that

                     Lois, can you cover this just a 
                     little longer?  I think I hear a 
                     siren.

      He's gone.  She sits.



      Mindy is in here alone, dabbing her eyes, crying.  Junior 
      comes in.

                                      JUNIOR
                     Mindy?  What is it?

                     Is Dad okay?

      She looks at him and bursts into tears, full on.  He moves 
      to her.

                     other... and there's no reason why

      He leans into him, pressing her incredible body close to 
      his.

      Lois moves back to her desk, again passing the TV, where the
      Field Reporter is saying to camera:

                     ... so it has to make you wonder,
                     with all the good work being done
                     by the Church Group, what's left
                     for Superman to do these days?

      Someone's knocking on Lois' door.  She opens it.  It's BOBBY
      BIGMOUTH.

                     Pickles and mustard.  All you got

                     Hey, I'm not doing this for you.  
                     This town stays crime-free, I'm 
                     looking at having to live on three 
                     meals an hour.

      He exits.  She moves to the phone, starts to dial, then
      stops and looks at the phone:

                                      LOIS
                     No...  I think things'll go a
                     little smoother if I'm partner-free
                     tonight.

      She hangs up.



      JOE THE BLOW sits in the lamplight, smoking a cigar, working
      on an intricate bomb timing mechanism.  He looks at his
      watch, stretches, puts all of his equipment in a toolbox,
      locks it, gets up and leaves.

      Beat.

      Then the door squeaks open and in walks Lois, dressed as a
      maid.  She scans the depressing little room, then spies the
      toolbox.  Pulls a lockpick out of her skirt and begins to
      work on the lock; opens the toolbox and sees the explosive
      devices there.

                     You came up with some kind of
                     really brilliant way of keeping him

                     disaster someplace else?



      She comes out of the bathroom, hair wet, and steps on --         (X)

      -- a rubber mat. We hear a CLICK and the VOICE of Joe the
      Blow:

                                      VOICE
                     This is a recording.  Don't step
                     off the mat.

      Lois sees the mat she's on is wired to a BOMB.

                                      VOICE (CONT'D)
                     You look like you're in pretty good
                     shape.  Do a lot of jumping jacks?
                     Start now, stay on the mat, and
                     keep the beat...

      Atop the bomb is a dancer's metronome. It clicks off the
      time and Lois starts doing jumping jacks on the mat,
      matching the clicks.

                                      VOICE (CONT'D)
                     The rules are simple.  Stop... and
                     die.  Slow down... and die.  Okay,

      bedside clock, which reads 9:05 AM, we...

                                      VOICE

      The clock reads 9:55.  Lois is going as fast as humanly
      possible, pushed past the brink of endurance as the clicks
      of the metronome become like a Geiger counter.

                     I'm not giving you any look.

                     Okay, since you asked... what took
                     an hour?

                     A nuclear reactor was melting down
                     in Philadelphia.  What's your
                     point?

                                      LOIS
                     Just that maybe you're taking my
                     jeopardy a little for granted these
                     days.

                                      LOIS
                     Well, I can understand, it's not
                     this new sizzling romance anymore;
                     I don't look at you like a
                     mooney-eyed cheerleader... and
                     maybe you look at _me_ differently,
                     too.  I'm just good ol' Lois... get
                     around to her _whenever_.

                                      SUPERMAN
                     That is ridiculous.

                                      LOIS
                     Just food for thought.  Well, if                  (X)
                     you're not busy, guess we'd better                (X)
                     try and find the guy who did this.                (X)

      She exits.

                                      SUPERMAN
                     All things considered, I'd rather
                     be in Philadelphia.

                     ... we went back to the hotel and
                     Joe the Blow was gone; in fact
                     according to the computer register,
                     he was never there.

                     Well, we have clue half.  When I
                     went into his toolbox, there was a
                     diagram of the Museum of Art.  And
                     this morning, Clark and I each
                     got --

                     And the only connection I can see
                     is, Church, Sr. just started buying
                     art like the Russians are in
                     Oregon.

                                      PERRY
                     So you think he might be out to
                     increase the value of his
                     collection by ridding the world of
                     a few Modiglianis?

                     Well, the friendship got a little
                     strained when that whelp of his
                     kidnapped me.  We're all going to

      Clark sits with Jonathan, having a heart to heart:

                                      JONATHAN
                     Son, I never told you this but...
                     your Mom turned me down the first
                     time I asked her to marry me.

                                      CLARK
                     You're kidding.

                                      JONATHAN
                     Actually, the first two times.

                     I sulked.  Dove into my work.
                     Unfortunately, it was winter, so I
                     looked pretty silly plowing those
                     fields in the snow.  Anyway, around
                     about spring, I finally realized
                     that getting married wasn't just
                     about my feelings, hurt as they
                     were.  Your Mom was young, scared;
                     she knew she loved me but was it a
                     lifetime kind of love?  She
                     needed...

                     ... time... to think it over, to
                     get to know him the way he really
                     is. Is that so unreasonable?

                                      MARTHA
                     No.  But you have to understand,
                     Clark's always been alone.

                     When he was thirteen and getting

                     strong -- he made up his own mind
                     he wasn't going to tell anybody.

                     broke ray heart, watching him having 
                     to hide so much; afraid held always

                     you.  You can get through anything 
                     else.  My God, I turned Jonathan

                     made it down the aisle.

                     Well, I thought he was crazy.  
                     Every time I said no, he'd get on

                     snow...

                     This is so nice.  Almost thirty 
                     years and you're the first woman

      Many THUGGISH MEN gather around a silhouetted figure behind
