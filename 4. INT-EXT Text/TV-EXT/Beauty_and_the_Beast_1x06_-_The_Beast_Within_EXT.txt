      The energy of the waterfront. The rumble of trucks and
      trains and forklifts, the clatter of cargo, the grumble of
      tugs, the counterpoint of ships' whistles. Giant cranes
      heave containers, some as large as boxcars, loaded and
      sealed in faraway lands, from the decks of ships to the
      backs of 18-wheelers. Hundreds of longshoremen. There's a
      movement and force to the waterfront as awesome as the
      sea itself.



      We PAN from the open hatch of a cargo ship as the crane
      lifts a giant turbine generator... to a car pulling up on
      the dock.

      MITCH DENTON

      gets out of the car. Recently released from prison, his
      face is worn and lined, but he's charismatic, good-looking in
        a cruel way, a man given to sudden volcanic violences that
      come and go in a breath, often replaced by a sardonic laugh.
      He has a need to dominate that is truly dangerous.

      A muscular hiring boss, NAT, comes over.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                     4.

                    Six hundred and twenty-three guys
                    at five bucks a head. Not a bad
                    slice from these piers.

                                    DENTON
                              (unimpressed)
                    It's a start. Any trouble?

                                    NAT
                            (a shrug)
                      You've been off the docks a few
                      years. Everybody don't know
                      you're back. Some of the
                      importers figure --

                                    DENTON
                    Tell them I'm doing the figuring
                    from now on. Next time I'll pull
                      a walkout. See how they like
                      their Nip cars sitting on the
                      docks for a month.

                                    NAT
                    Don't worry about it --

                                    DENTON
                    I'm not worried.
                            (beat)
                    What about Fraser?

                                    NAT
                    He's working in the hatch. I hear
                    he hasn't changed his mind about
                      talking to the union.

                                    DENTON
                            (a smile)
                      Hasn't he...? 

      Nat understands, nods... turns back to the ship and jumps
      down on the deck.



      Cathy approaches the ship with union official DE CORSIA,
      a beefy no-nonsense longshoreman who graduated up to a white
      collar.

                                    DE CORSIA
                    They say the waterfront spits
                      poison, breaks the backs of its
                      workers, and harbors the scum of
                    the world. That's all true, Miss
                      Chandler --
                            (a smile)
                    -- but God help me, I love this
                      place, stink and all.

      Cathy gazes around, awed by the power of the docks.

                                    CATHY
                    It's pretty overwhelming. I'm
                      afraid my waterfront education
                      began and ended with Marlon
                      Brando.

                                    DE CORSIA
                    Some things never change. Long
                    as there's piers and 'shoremen,
                      there's bloodsuckers to prey on
                      them.

                                    CATHY
                      You're the union. You must know
                      things we could use against people
                    like Denton.

                                    DE CORSIA
                              (shrugs)
                    We know lots of things_ But prove
                    them ... ? This is the waterfront.
                      Nobody talks.

      They start to board the cargo ship.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              6.

                              (continuing)
                    But I've managed to line up a
                      longshoreman who might know a
                    thing or two. A guy with real
                    guts who's sick and tired of
                      having a mob noose around his
                    neck. Name of Charlie Fraser.

      THE DECK

      as Nat yells down into the hatch.

                                    NAT
                      Fraser! Move it up!

      IN THE HATCH

      Fraser gives him a rude sign, finishes hitching the
      generator to the pallet.

                                    NAT
                              (yells to crane)
                    Okay, take it away.

      THE TURBINE GENERATOR

      rises out of the hatch, watched by longshoremen. One of

      them, a mean  looking jock called CUJO, inches closer to
      Fraser.

      MITCH DENTON

      watches from his car... waiting.

      CATHY

      glances up at the generator as De Corsia gets a worker to
      point out where Fraser is.

      THE CRANE OPERATOR

      suddenly appears to lose control.

      THE GENERATOR

        plunges downwards.

        CHARLIE FRASER

      in the middle of the hatch...  He jerks his head up as the
        generator hustles back towards him. Cujo pushes him
      forward. 

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              7 .


      CONTINUED: (2)

                                    LONGSHOREMAN
                      Fraser!

        A longshoreman tries to yank Fraser out of danger. Too
      late. The generator crashes down on him.

      CATHY - ON DECK

      rushes to stare down into the hatch.

                                    CATHY
                    Dear God!

      MITCH DENTON

      motions his driver with a sour smile.

                                    DENTON
                    Now everybody knows I'm back.

      As the car pulls away:

      CATHY

      joins De Corsia and the others around Fraser's crushed and
      broken body.

                                    DE CORSIA
                                    (grim)
                      Welcome to the waterfront.

      On Cathy's stricken face:



      Burned out piers, tenement streets lit by dim lamps. A BOAT
      WHISTLE cries in the night. Some of the buildings are
      terrible, others are okay. We MOVE IN on one tenement that
      has its share of garbage, graffiti and grit, but doesn't
      have any windows broken out. It's like an old person trying
      to hold itself together -- doesn't look great but still
      trying.

      We HEAR VINCENT'S VOICE reading:

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              8.


      CONTINUED:

                                    VINCENT (V.O.)
                    "The deck was deserted, and he
                      crawled to the extreme end of it,
                    near the flagpole. There he
                      doubled up in limp agony. His
                    head swelled; sparks of fire
                      danced before his eyes; his body
                      seemed to lose weight, while his
                    heels wavered in the breeze."



      CLOSE on photos, clippings and police records on Mitch
      Denton ... WIDENING to Cathy trying to absorb them. She
      sighs in frustration. There's a SOUND  She turns as Vincent
      appears behind her.

                                    CATHY
                      Vincent...

                                    VINCENT
                    It's been too long, Catherine.

      They almost embrace... hold back.

                                    VINCENT
                   I'm glad you sent word. There
                   are many things I need to
                   talk  about.

                                    CATHY
                      I need you, too. I feel so
                      angry... helpless. A brave man
                    was murdered today because he
                      wanted to talk to me.

      She throws the Denton files down bitterly, stares out across
      the city.

                                    CATHY
                              (continuing)
                      I used to love the breeze from
                    the river. Now I can only think
                    of the death that comes with it.

                                    VINCENT
                              (comforting)
                    Not always death. Sometimes I
                    go out to the harbor to see the
                      ships and I can sense the life
                    and feelings of men and women in
                      faraway lands. Their energies
                    and passions --
                              (sadly)
                    Of course, it's not true.
                      Feelings are not the same for
                      everyone. How could they be?

                                    CATHY
                      Vincent... what's troubling you?

                                    VINCENT
                      I don't know how to say it...
                      There are certain feelings that
                      confuse me.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                           14.
        CONTINUED:

                                    CATHY
                    Can you describe them?

                                    VINCENT
                              (hesitates)
                    The feelings that come from caring
                      about a child... a child like Luke.

                                    CATHY
                              (surprised)
                    The boy you told me about last
                    time? You said he's been in and
                    out of trouble for years.

                                    VINCENT
                    Not so much anymore. He's scared
                    and lonely. He hides his feelings
                      behind a protective wall.
                              (heartfelt)
                      Catherine... I don't know how it
                      happened... Luke's slipped into
                    my life, day by day. I've started
                    to feel as if he's my own flesh
                    and blood.

                                    CATHY
                      That s wonderful. I don't believe
                    any of us are given feelings of
                    love simply to hide them.

                                    VINCENT
                    You know what I am. You and
                      Father are the only family I have.
                      Luke's changed that. He was
                      abandoned as I was... needing
                      someone to guide him as I needed
                      Father to guide me. I want him
                    to have a chance for a decent life --

      He looks at her, eyes filled with longing.

                                    VINCENT
                              (continuing)
                    Did you mean what you said? About
                    not hiding feelings of love... ?

                                    CATHY
                              (softly)
                    Do you need to ask?

      They are suddenly very still, very aware of each other.
        Vincent moves to touch her hair ... then withdraws his hand.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                    CATHY
                              (continuing)
                      I found something in my father's
                      library. It's from the Greek.
                      I wanted to give it to you -

                                    VINCENT
                      Tell me.

      Cathy picks up a sheet of paper with a poem written on it.

                                    CATHY
                       Thus every race on earth of men
                      and beasts, And the creatures of
                      the sea, The herds and birds of
                      brilliant hue, Are swept with
                      passion. Love is the same for
                      all."

                                    VINCENT
                              (echoing)
                        Love is the same for all --

      His hand closes over hers with deep love.


      Early morning. Luke whistles, carries a sack of groceries
      down the street to Sam's building... slows at the sight of a
      big car pulling up opposite.

      LUKE'S POV - MITCH DENTON

      gesturing his driver to stay... crossing the street.

      BACK TO LUKE

      watching curiously as Denton enters Sam's building.




      Denton bursts through a coal chute to an alley in the
        outside world. He's startled to find Luke waiting.


                                  LUKE
                            (defiant)
                    I'm not a kid. Vincent shouldn't
                    push me around.

      Denton smiles with cynical pleasure.

                                    DENTON
                      That's right, Luke. You're not
                      a kid any more.

      He puts a fatherly arm around the boy. And as they head off
        together:
                                                                FADE OUT.

                                      ACT THREE


      FADE IN:


      Cathy returns to the office. Kipper dashes up and drops a
      message into her hand, quickly zips away. Cathy reads the
      message... understands, hurries away from the office.




      Cathy glances around... enters the duct.



      An old rusty bridge spanning a less travelled part of the
      river.



      Luke gazes with fascination at the barge tethered under the
      bridge as several muscular men unload cargo crates and carry
      them into a couple of old shacks, once used to house
      equipment for the bridge. We PICK UP Denton wheeling and
      dealing with a few associates, including the hiring boss,
      Nat, and the longshoreman, Cujo (both seen earlier during
      Charlie Fraser's murder.) Luke goes over to him, concerned.

                                    DENTON
                    Get away with those video units
                    last night?
                                    CUJO
                      I faked the bills of lading.
                      Customs won't even know they're
                      gone.

                                    DENTON
                    What I like to hear. Give me a
                      tally on this, will you, Luke?
      He hands Luke the bills of lading.
                                    LUKE
                      You want me to count these?

                                    DENTON
                    When I was your age, I used to
                      count the boss' cut every day.

                     LUKE
           
        (pleased)
                 Well, sure  -                
                       (uncertain)
                      But... is all this stuff stolen?

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              36.

                                    DENTON
                              ("offended")
                      I did some favors for a few guys,
                      that's all. How'd you like this
                      boat? Maybe we'll take a trip
                    on it later, okay?

                                    LUKE
                      Well, okay.

      Denton ruffles Luke's hair... moves off with Nat.

                                    NAT
                      Taking a chance, aren't you, with
                    this kid?

                                    DENTON
                    He's okay. He's got brains and
                      he'll never tell what he sees.

                                  NAT
                            (grunts)
                      You're sure?

                                    DENTON
                      I know this kid like I know
                      myself.
                              (twisted smile)
                      I also know an old friend who's
                    not going to like Luke being with
                    me one little bit. And that's
                    the best reason of all to have
                    him here.

      Luke brings the bills back over.

                                    LUKE
                      Mitch? I count four thousand,
                      three hundred and sixty dollars
                      here.

                                    DENTON
                    Good work, Luke. How'd you like
                    to do a little more work for me?
                    Make yourself some pocket money?


                                    LUKE
                              (getting into it)
                      Sure.  Help me get that Corvette!

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                          37.


      CONTINUED: (2)

                                    DENTON
                              (manipulating him)
                    You know, thinking about what you
                    want is a lot of fun. But it's
                    just a lot of daydreaming unless
                    you get down to a few cold hard
                    facts of life. I could help you.

                                    LUKE
                    How do you mean?

      Denton looks at him ... shakes his head as if having second
      thoughts.

                                    DENTON
                      I don't know. I need a kid I can
                      trust. If you're chicken --

                                    LUKE
                    I'm not chicken! You can trust
                    me.

                                    DENTON

                      Everybody who works with me's got
                    to have pride in themselves. You
                    got that kind of pride, Luke?


                                    LUKE
                    Just try me. I can do anything
                    you want, Mitch.

                                    DENTON
                              ("deciding")
                      How'd you like to help me with
                      a little job tonight... ?

      He's got Luke hooked.



      We PAN from a dark warehouse to a couple of trucks parked in
        shadows... tough guys assembling... to Denton's car further
        back. Nat and Cujo leave the car to join the other men.
        Denton holds back, pointing out a high window in the
        warehouse to Luke... who's increasingly uneasy.

                                      DENTON
                      When you get through the window,
                      keep to the stairs and come down
                      to the first level. You know how
                      to unlock a fire exit?

                                    LUKE
                      That window? You're kidding.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                              40.

                                    DENTON
                      I'm kidding? Do I look like I'm
                      kidding?

                                    LUKE
                      I didn't figure on something like
                      this, Mitch. I mean, I want to
                      work with you --
                              (at the trucks)
                      But this is a heavy duty heist.

                                    DENTON
                      A few high tech micro-computers...
                      Nobody's even going to know
                      they're gone.

                                    LUKE
                      I don't want to mess with it,
                      okay?

      Denton grabs him by the arm, twisting. Luke grimaces in
      pain.

                                    DENTON
                      What's the matter with you? I
                      thought you knew something. I
                      thought you learned something from
                      me.

                                    LUKE
                      I don't want to go up there. It's
                      stupid --

                                    DENTON
                              (fierce)
                      You're stupid, kid. I'm going
                      to give you two seconds to get
                      hold of yourself. Then you're
                      going through that window. You're
                      not going to make me look bad in
                      front of these guys.
                              (deadly)
                      And if you screw up, I'm gonna
                      bust you. I can do a whole lot
                      of wicked stuff to you

      And as Luke writhes in terror:



      Luke peers over the edge. A long way down. Nat finishes
        unrolling a rope ladder down past the window. Cujo hands
      Luke a canvas bag. The boy shoulders it, swings over the
      edge of the roof onto the ladder. The rope sways
        dangerously. But there's no escape for Luke. He grits his
      teeth... moves down until he reaches:

      THE WINDOW

      Luke pulls out a chisel and crowbar from his bag. A
      precarious moment. He jimmies the window open, heaves
      himself inside.

      ANGLE - MITCH DENTON

      down below, seeing Luke vanish from sight.



        Vincent is brooding across the dark waters... jerks his head
      up at the sound of ALARMS.



      Denton rages as ALARMS sound. He yells to the trucks.

                                    DENTON
                      Take off! Take off!

      He dashes back to his car.                                                                              43.



      Vincent throws caution to the wind... races with the speed
      of a lion.



      Luke breaks free of the fire exit... runs like crazy for
      Denton's car.

                                    DENTON
                    Over here! Kid! Over here!

      Denton's driver squeals the car towards Luke to pick him up.
      Denton holds his door open.

      LUKE

      is suddenly transfixed in an overwhelming glare -- the
      headlights of one of the trucks careening around to escape.

        VINCENT

      arrives... sees what's going to happen... his horror.

                                    VINCENT
                     Luke!  No!


      LUKE

      spins around... the truck is upon him. There's a sickening
        crunch. His body hits the ground.

      DENTON

      sees Vincent... slams his door shut.

                                    DENTON
                      Get outta here!

        VINCENT

      rushes to Luke's unconscious body. Behind him, guards and
      lights and alarms. They haven't spotted him yet.

                                    VINCENT
                    Luke --

      A sob breaks from him. He tenderly cradles Luke in his
      arms. The boy seems dead. And as Vincent's grief erupts
      in a terrible bone-chilling CRY of pain and despair and
        rage...

                                                                FADE OUT.


                         END OF ACT THREE

                                                                                          44.


                                  ACT FOUR


      FADE IN:


      The sweep of steel, arching across the sky... the movements
      of armed men on guard.                                                                              48.



        Vincent explodes through brick and wood of a walled up old
      duct. He scrambles to the surface, stares breathlessly out
      at the river. Turns... and sees the bridge.




      CLOSE ON an armed guard looking out over the river.
        Vincent's arm reaches INTO FRAME and hooks him around the
      neck, pulling him down into the shallows. A GURGLING
      sound... silence.


        Vincent leaps up the bank towards the huts at the base of
      the bridge. He scans the land with feral instinct... He
      senses Denton's presence behind a high lighted window. His
      fangs draw back. A low growl.


        There's the ratchet-click of an automatic weapon being
        recocked. Another guard, searching for his partner. He
      turns... sees Vincent charging down upon him with terrifying
      force. Vincent rips the guard apart. Bullets spew wildly.


                                                     (CONTINUED)                                                                                      50.


      CONTINUED:

      THE TOWER DOOR slams open. The gunfire brings YELLS inside.
      Glaring light frames a shadow with an automatic weapon.
      Vincent lets go a blood-curdling snarl... and again life
      leaves a guard. Vincent slips inside the tower.




        Cathy's car careens to a halt. She runs out... sees the
      fallen guards.  Fearing the worst, she runs to the tower.         51.



      Vincent hurls Denton out onto a high girder. Denton
      scrambles away in terror, almost falling. Vincent's a
      fierce, dramatic figure, fangs bared, cloak billowing as
      he's raked by high winds.

                                    DENTON
                      Mother of God! Please! Please,
                      don't!

      He crawls out to a dangerous exposed point on the girders,
      clings to it.

                                  DENTON
                              (continuing)
                      I didn't hurt the kid -- it was
                    an accident --

      Vincent growls. His ferocity is frightening and awesome. He
      starts forward to finish Denton off.

                                    CATHY (O.S.)
                            (shouting)
                     Vincent! No!

      Vincent turns to see Cathy at the shattered window.

                                    VINCENT
                    You shouldn't have Come here.

                                    CATHY
                      I had to come. Don't do this
                      terrible thing.

                                    VINCENT
                    He doesn't deserve to live.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              52.

                              (pleading)
                    But you can choose to let him
                      live. In your heart, you know
                      that's right.

                                    VINCENT
                    In my heart I feel only pain.

                                    CATHY
                    Your pain is for Luke. For his
                      life... for his love.

                                    VINCENT
                    You know what I am -- 

                                    CATHY
                              (reaching out)
                      You're you -- my Vincent. My kind
                    and gentle love. Don't give in
                    to that other instinct inside you.

                                    VINCENT
                    In your world, people give in to
                    this instinct --

                                    CATHY
                      Frightened, bitter lonely
                      people. Like him --

      She points to Denton.

                                    CATHY
                              (continuing)
                    Come home, Vincent. Come back
                    to us --

      And on Cathy's appeal... and Vincent staring down at Denton:



      Cathy has fallen asleep in her chair as light begins to
      streak the night sky. She suddenly blinks, sits up.
        Vincent is there.

                                    VINCENT
                      Luke's strong. He's going to make
                      a wonderful recovery.

                                    CATHY
                              (nods)
                      Things will be better when he
                    comes back home.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              54.

                              (shakes his head)
                      Luke was never meant to live in
                      the underworld. I'll find him
                      a good home in your world.

                                    CATHY
                      My world... ? I feel so sad every
                      time you say that. My world...
                      your world. Can't they ever be
                      the same?

                                    VINCENT
                      I don't know, Catherine. I wanted
                      a man's life last night. Wanted
                      to kill --

                                    CATHY
                      Don't... it's over...

                                    VINCENT
                    Is it? Denton called me a beast
                      pretending to be a man... and
                      I found another beast within
                      myself...

                                    CATHY
                            (eyes welling)
                    There are many men who are more
                      beasts than you... but they hide
                    it. You have the finest heart
                    of any man.

                                    VINCENT
                      You're crying... for me...

                                    CATHY
                      ...and for myself. I feel your
                      pain... and your love.
      They're both choked with emotion.

                                    VINCENT
                    Even with two worlds between us...?

                                    CATHY
                      "Love is the same for all -- "

      And as they move to a tender embrace...

                                                                FADE OUT.

                                    THE END
