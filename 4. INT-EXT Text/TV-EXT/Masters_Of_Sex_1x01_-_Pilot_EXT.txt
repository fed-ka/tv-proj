  A busy downtown sidewalk illuminated by the lamps of the hotel 
  overhang.  A DOORMAN moves to the curb, opens the door of a 
  sleek Ford Fairlane.  Well-heeled guests emerge, VANISH behind 
  the heavy brass doors.  A VOICE drifts to the surface.

                                    VOICE (O.S.)
                ... a bellwether in the field of 
                  obstetrics and gynecology.  Maternity 
                Hospital has set a new standard in 
                the Midwest.  The highest standard.

  SUPER:  RITZ CARLETON HOTEL - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - 1956

                                    VOICE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                So high that even our friends on the 
                coasts are now paying attention.

  A RIPPLE of laughter, as we go...


  A quiet booth in the corner.  The jukebox plays the Platters, 
   You ve Got That Magic Touch,  as Sally DiMello, now clothed 
  and ravenous, DEVOURS a mountain of food while Masters sips 
  his coffee.  He WATCHES her.  Glances at his clipboard.   

                                    MASTERS
                Arousal states for clients one and 
                six were instantaneous.  Four took 
                ten minutes, making him the slowest.  
                Seven achieved no arousal at all...  
                            (off Sally s shrug)
                The interval between arousal and 
                climax also varied considerably.  The 
                last client, number eight... how long 
                did he stay in the plateau state?  

                                    SALLY
                For fucking ever. 

                                    MASTERS
                I have eleven minutes.

                                    SALLY
                You re the expert.  

  Sally turns back to her entree.  Masters WATCHES this a beat.  
  A slight expression of disapproval crosses his face.  

                                    MASTERS
                Your napkin actually goes in your 
                lap.

                                    SALLY
                From a man standing in a closet 
                watching people hump all night. 

                                    MASTERS
                It s work.

                                    SALLY
                Really.

                                    MASTERS
                Which reminds me... you might 
                consider keeping a journal.  You 
                could time a lot of this yourself, 
                even if it s counting in your head.

                                    SALLY
                          (a long look)
                What is the matter with you?  
                  Seriously?                                                                                      5.


                                    MASTERS
                I can t be there every night.

                                    SALLY
                Just when we were getting so close.

  Masters decides to ignore this.  TURNS back at his clipboard.

                                    MASTERS
                Client eight, I have your climax 
                lasted approximately... nine seconds?   
                            (off her blank look)
                Ernie.  With the pants.

  Sally starts to LAUGH.  Then realizes Masters isn t kidding.  
  She considers this.  Speaks slowly, as if to a child.

                                    SALLY
                I was faking.

                                    MASTERS
                You... didn t have an orgasm.

                                    SALLY
                You re serious now...

                                    MASTERS
                Yes, I m serious.  You faked an 
                orgasm?  Is that a common practice 
                amongst prostitutes?  

                                    SALLY
                It s a common practice amongst anyone 
                with a twat.  Women fake orgasms.  
                Almost all of them.  Although I 
                haven t checked my clipboard lately.

                                    MASTERS
                But... why?  Why would a woman lie 
                about something like that? 

                                    SALLY
                God almighty.  This is... okay.  I m 
                gonna be honest with you, but only 
                cause I like you and you seem real 
                  dedicated about your project, in the 
                penguin suit and all, with the charts 
                and the timer, and you ve never 
                stiffed me on the money, not once... 
                But seriously... If you really wanna 
                learn about sex... you are gonna have 
                to get yourself a female partner.  

  Sally gives him a pitiful LOOK.  Plops her napkin in her lap.                                                                                        6.



  A modest two storey building.  Gall s  56 Hudson Rambler pulls 
  into the carport.  The engine RATTLES to a stop.  


  An Eichler-esque mid-century home in the leafy St. Louis 
  suburb.  A shiny, black MG zips into the driveway, top-down, 
  Masters behind the wheel.  Masters HOPS out, unruffled in his 
  suit and bow-tie.  Makes his way up the walkway.


  A series of X-RAYS of a woman s pelvis HANG illuminated from 
  light boxes.  Masters and Gall STAND before the images.  

                                    GALL
                It s not like I pressured her into 
                it.  In fact, she pressured me.                                                                                    32.


                                    MASTERS
                How traumatic for you.  
                            (points)
                Scar tissue along the anterior wall.  

                                    GALL
                And it was like... like the kind of 
                sex you have when you re married.
                            (off Masters  look)
                Or on your honeymoon.  I m guessing.  
                Or like sex with a prostitute, if she 
                were a nice girl... not that I ve 
                been with a prostitute, but... Jesus 
                Christ, I need your help.

                                    MASTERS
                            (points again)
                Mrs. May needs my help.  Mrs. May 
                wants a baby and, off this, I d put 
                her chances at ten percent.  

                                    GALL
                            (looks at the x-rays)
                Fifteen.  Maybe.  You might be able 
                to remove the lesions surgically.

  Masters STARES at the x-rays as he considers it.  Clearly 
  worried.  He senses Gall s eyes on him.  Finally.

                                    MASTERS
                I am terrible at playing cupid.

                                    GALL
                But you see Gini every day.  Maybe 
                you could put in a good word for me.  

                                    MASTERS
                So we ll both look like we re twelve?

                                    GALL
                I don t know what else to do.  I m 
                crazy about her, but she s killing 
                me.  I mean, what is it she wants?

                                    MASTERS
                What does the woman you re sleeping 
                with want? 
                            (pulls the x-rays)
                The conundrum of deep space and the 
                riddle of life itself can t come 
                close to the unfathomable mystery of 
                that question.

  As Masters CLICKS off the lights.                                                                                    33.



  As a flustered Masters PULLS magazines from a cupboard, then 
  senses a presence behind him.  He TURNS.  Johnson stands with 
  a stack of files.  She LOOKS at the magazines.  An odd beat.

                                    MASTERS
                            (with a look)
                Miss DiMello is a patient...  

                                    JOHNSON
                And I learned long ago not to judge.  
                But I will say, I like your wife.  
                And she is down the hall, enduring 
                  infertility treatments.  Which is why 
                this seems a bit... indelicate.  On 
                your part.  If I may be so blunt.

                                    MASTERS
                Next time you re blunt, you might 
                also try being right.

  A tense beat.  Masters sees he has no choice but to continue.

                                    MASTERS (CONT D)
                I m starting a new study and I hired 
                you because I need an assistant and I 
                suspect you might have a gift for the 
                work.  That said, if you re 
                  uncomfortable with what I m doing 
                here, you should speak up now and I 
                can make other arrangements.

                                    JOHNSON
                I m... not sure what it is you re 
                doing.                                                                                      39.


                                    MASTERS
                I have wired Miss Dimello to monitor 
                her pulse, heart rate, and brain 
                waves so as to illuminate to my 
                  patients, and the general community, 
                what happens to the body during 
                sexual stimulation and orgasm.  The 
                  magazines are to help with the 
                  stimulation part, because unbeknownst 
                to me, Miss DiMello prefers women.  
                Which quite frankly worries me, as it 
                may in fact throw off my data.

                                    JOHNSON
                Why would it throw off your data?  
                Isn t an orgasm an orgasm?

                                    MASTERS
                That s one of many questions I hope 
                to answer.  But since she is my only 
                subject, I really don t have a 
                choice, whatever her orientation.  So 
                are you interested in the job or not?

  Johnson STARES at him, a million thoughts at once.  

                                    JOHNSON
                I m not sure why you chose me. 

                                    MASTERS
                  Instinct.

                                    JOHNSON
                Even though I don t have a college 
                degree.  Or know anything about 
                biology or anatomy...  

                                    MASTERS
                I can teach you.

                                    JOHNSON
                If you picked a female MD, she would 
                already know all that.

                                    MASTERS
                A woman doctor would never jeopardize 
                her career on such a risky subject.

                                    JOHNSON
                So... you re jeopardizing yours?

                                    MASTERS
                            (beat, finally)
                The study hasn t been approved.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    40.

                                    MASTERS (CONT'D)
                In fact, Shepley has strictly 
                  forbidden it.  So, yes... my career s 
                in jeopardy. 
                            (off her look)
                I m doing it anyway.  I m going to 
                collect the data, I m certain the 
                results will be compelling enough 
                that Shepley will approve the study 
                after the fact.  But this has to be 
                done in absolute secrecy, since if 
                Shepley finds out before the fact... 
                I ll be fired.

  A long beat.  Johnson watches him.  Finally.

                                    JOHNSON
                So how can I help?


  As Masters and a wary Shepley now MOVE down the hallway.  

                                    SHEPLEY
                  I thought we put this matter to bed.

                                    MASTERS
                We did.  With regards to approaching 
                the board.  But this is work I ve 
                been doing on my own time.

                                    SHEPLEY
                            (stops, a hard look)
                An extra-curricular hobby, like model 
                building or macrame?  Bill, I said 
                 no.   I meant  no.   Which part of 
                 no  do you not understand?

                                    MASTERS
                The part that believes you re still a 
                  scientist, Ethan. 
                            (off Shepley s look)
                All I am asking is that you take off 
                your management hat for five minutes, 
                and let me show you what any serious 
                  scientist would kill to see.  

  As we HOLD ON Shepley s face...


  Johnson fetches a soda from a vending machine, as Shepley sits 
  with Masters in the outdoor lunch area.   Shepley loosens his 
  tie, tries to recover himself.  He LOOKS around, clearly hot 
  and sweaty.  Johnson returns with a drink.  Hands it to him.

                                    SHEPLEY
                Thank you.

  Shepley takes it and GULPS.  A beat.  Attempts to recover.  
  Finally.   

                                    SHEPLEY (CONT D)
                I will admit... to observe a female, 
                during coitus, from the inside...

                In full color.  With no distortion.                                                                                    49.


                                    SHEPLEY
                No.  No distortion at all.
                            (takes another gulp)
                It s... well, it s a remarkable feat. 

                                    MASTERS
                Which is why it s time to go public, 
                Ethan.  Time to submit this proposal 
                to the board.

                                    SHEPLEY
                            (knew this was coming)
                Goddamn it.  You promised me...

                                    MASTERS
                I did not promise...

                                    SHEPLEY
                A study where a naked woman mounts a 
                  mechanical phallus... 

                                    MASTERS
                What we ve done here is 
                  revolutionary, you know it is...

                                    JOHNSON
                And it s not just the technology.  
                The new data we re collecting dispels 
                years of myth about how a woman s 
                body anticipates sex...

                                    MASTERS
                ... we ve already debunked many of 
                Freud s theories.  Plus charted clear-
                cut stages of sexual response, four 
                in all...

                                    JOHNSON
                ... we re starting to see some women 
                are capable of multiple orgasms...

                                    SHEPLEY
                            (turns to Masters)
                Why does your secretary keep talking 
                to me?  I already gave you my answer.  

                                    MASTERS
                It s not an answer I can accept.
                            (off Shepley s look)
                I have made this hospital a fortune.  
                Our patient base has tripled, we re 
                ranked second in the country, our 
                donors can t write checks fast enough 
                in large part because of me.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    50.

                                    MASTERS (CONT'D)
                I got us to where we are now.  And 
                this study... this where we re going.  
                This is the future.  But if you won t 
                support me in blazing that trail, 
                I ll find another hospital that will.  

                                    SHEPLEY
                          (a long look)
                  Dangerous game you re playing.

                                    MASTERS
                It s not a game.  I need an answer by 
                the end of today.


  As Masters and Johnson now stand with Gilpatrick.  He STARES, 
  dumbstruck.  Johnson gives a winning smile.    

                                    JOHNSON
                You wanted to know what was going on 
                in Room Five.  

                                      GILPATRICK
                That... exceeded my expectations.
                            (an uncomfortable beat)
                I m flattered.  I suppose.  Although, 
                  honestly... I really don t think I 
                can stand there and, you know, wank 
                off while people were watching me.

                                    MASTERS
                That s not what this is.  The phase 
                we re considering you for is couples.

                                      GILPATRICK
                Couples?  Dear God... my wife barely 
                lets me see her naked.  

                                    MASTERS
                We don t mean you and your wife.

    Gilpatrick takes this in as Johnson SPIES Gall standing at the 
  bar with Libby.  He GESTURES Johnson over.  A beat.  Johnson 
  turns her attention back to Gilpatrick. 

                                    JOHNSON
                I m in the process of recruiting 
                several new female volunteers.

                                      GILPATRICK
                Which females...?

                                    JOHNSON
                We preserve the anonymity of all our 
                  volunteers.  But I already have a 
                  secretary.  I ve spoken with a nurse 
                and a hospital administrator s wife.

                                      GILPATRICK
                Come on.  Only hookers, old maids and 
                insane co-eds would agree to this...

                                    JOHNSON
                I resent that.                                                                                    55.


                                      GILPATRICK
                Have you signed up?

                                    JOHNSON
                I am Dr. Masters  partner.  
                  Otherwise, I would have no 
                  reservations about volunteering.  Our 
                subjects know they re advancing the 
                cause of science.  They know this is 
                  important work.  They do it happily 
                and committedly because they 
                  understand it s for the greater good.

                                    MASTERS
                These are young, smart, good-looking 
                women, Tom.  Trust me on this.

  The words Gilpatrick was looking for.  A long beat.  
    Gilpatrick finally GLANCES at his wife.

                                      GILPATRICK
                I don t know.  The whole thing seems 
                like... Christmas or something.

  As Gilpatrick finally gives a boyish grin.  Masters and 
  Johnson can t help but LAUGH, as Johnson feels a tug on her 
  arm.  She turns.  Gall STANDS by her side.

                                    GALL
                I need to talk to you.

                                    MASTERS
                Hello, Ira.  We re working here...

                                    GALL
                Yes, your wife told me.  Your wife 
                whose been standing by herself at the 
                bar the last twenty minutes.

  An awkward beat.  Johnson looks at Masters and Gilpatrick.

                                    JOHNSON
                Back in a moment, gentlemen.  But, 
                yes... Merry Christmas to us all.

  Johnson smiles, as Masters and Gilpatrick WATCH her go.


  The windows of the party GLOW behind them, as Johnson shivers 
  against the cold.  Gall paces angrily.  Clearly drunk.                                                                                    56.


                                    GALL
                You can t answer, can you?  How many 
                times have we slept together?

                                    JOHNSON
                Come back inside with me...

                                    GALL
                It s not that tough a question.  How 
                many times have you let me fuck you?

  Johnson gives him a long LOOK.  MOVES to walk around him.  

                                    JOHNSON
                We are not going to have this 
                  conversation now.

                                    GALL
                When is a good time, Virginia?  
                Because I haven t seen you in weeks.  

                                    JOHNSON
                You see me every day.

                                    GALL
                  I haven t seen you alone.  You work 
                late every night.  You ride home now 
                with that bowtied asshole.  I come 
                over, I get some bullshit excuse...

                                    JOHNSON
                It s not an excuse.  I ve been busy.  
                The study is expanding...

                                    GALL
                I don t care about the study.
                            (off her look)
                Please.  Don t do this.  Don t... not 
                talk to me.  Just tell me...  

                                    JOHNSON
                Tell you what?  That I don t like you 
                dragging me out here in the cold when 
                you re drunk and insulting?

                                    GALL
                Why would I insult you when you re 
                all I think about?  I have been in 
                your bed, I have been inside you...   
                            (off her face)
                What am I not doing?  Or doing too 
                much of?  What can I do better...                                                                                    57.


                                    JOHNSON
                Ira.  Please.  You re my friend.

                                    GALL
                Jesus Christ.  Do not say...

                                    JOHNSON
                You are my friend.

                                    GALL
                Friends don t fuck, Virginia.  Lovers 
                do.  People in love with each other, 
                they do.  People who give a shit.

                                    JOHNSON
                I care about you...

                                    GALL
                But you don t love me.  You ll make 
                love to me, you ll let me do 
                  anything, everything to you...

                                    JOHNSON
                Because I like it.  And you like it.  

                                    GALL
                I do it because I love you.  

                                    JOHNSON
                            (beat, finally)
                Then I m sorry.  I m sorry if I hurt 
                you.  That was never my intention...

  Gall SLAPS her.  Hard.  Johnson stares, stunned, then hits 
  back.  He GRABS her hair, PUNCHES her with his fist.  Johnson 
  GASPS as she tries to shake free of his grip. 

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                That s enough.
                            (as they struggle)
                I said that s enough.

  She SHOVES him hard.  Gall finally let s go.  STARES at her.  
  Chest heaving.  A trickle of blood seeps from Johnson s nose.

                                    GALL
                Fine.  Wear the lab coat, Virginia.  
                Run the study.  Play doctor all you 
                want.  At the end of the day... all 
                you really are is a whore.

  Gall TURNS and stomps back toward the party.                                                                                    58.
