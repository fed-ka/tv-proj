                                            ACT ONE


        FADE IN:

  1THE PLAZA. NIGHTEXT.1

        A cloudless, cold evening under a sky sharp with stars. Few
        people brave the chill that invades the air. At the top of
        the wide steps, the hotel doors open and a woman in a black
        cape emerges into the night. This is LISA CAMPBELL. Over
        this:

                                      VINCENT (V.O.)
                      You darkness, that I come from,/
                        I love you more than all the
                        fires/ that fence in the world,/


    2CLOSE LISA2

          Etherially beautiful, descending the stairs. She pauses and
        looks back up at the hotel, her long hair blowing about her
          face... eyes wide as a frightened deer that flees the lion.
        Seeing nothing, she pushes forward.

                                      VINCENT (V. O.)
                      for the fire makes / a circle of
                        light for everyone,/


    3ANGLES3

        As Lisa hurries down the slick sidewalk, swallowed into the
        night.

                                      VINCENT (V. O.)
                      and then no one outside learns of
                        you./                                                                                        2

    4 EXT. STREETSNIGHT4

        An alto sax is heard, faint and faraway, seeming to draw Lisa
          onward. Breathlessly, she turns a corner, stops dead
        in her tracks, listens ..... Nothing except the sax. Nobody
        is following. She continues moving, this caped figure in the
        dark. Finally, around yet another corner, she comes upon
          CLARENCE, playing his lonely sax, to the lonely night-- case
        opend before him

                                      VINCENT (V. O.)
                      But the darkness pulls in
                        everything:/


    5CLOSE LISA5

        With trembling hands and bowed head, she takes a sealed
        envelope from the folds of her cape and drops it into the case.
        Clarence doesn't miss a beat but his eyes widen ever
        so slightly .... as he watches her withdraw.

                                      VINCENT (V.O.)
                        shapes and fires, animals and
                        myself,/


    6RESUME6

        as Lisa quickly makes her way back towards the hotel.

                                                VINCENT (V.O.)
                      how easily it gathers them! --/
                        powers and people--/


    7WIDER ANGLE7

        Lisa hastens back along an alley. From the opposite side of
        the street, a shadowed figure of a man watches her.


    88SHADOWED MAN

        Close on the intent face of COLLIN HEMMINGS (British). A well
        dressed, heavy set man, his shrewd eyes following her.

                                      VINCENT (V.O.)
                        and it is possible a great
                        energy /

                                                                    CUT TO:                                                                                        3



  9INT. VINCENT'S CHAMBER. NIGHT9

          Vincent sits in his chair, the book of poems open in his
        lap.

                                      VINCENT'S VOICE
                      is moving near me./ I have faith in
                        nights.

        As Vincent finishes reading the poem, Father enters.

                                      FATHER

                        Vincent&

          Vincent gazes up at Father, who seems troubled by some
          distant anguish.

                                      VINCENT
                      What is it, Father?

                                      FATHER
                      A message arrived for you tonight.
                      From above.

        Father draws the sealed envelope from his coat, passes it
        to Vincent. Vincent turns it over in his hands, examines
        his name written in a familiar cursive. He breaks the seal and
        pulls out the Plaza stationery. He reads the short note.


                                      FATHER
                      Is it...?

                                      VINCENT
                      Yes, Father.

                                      FATHER
                      What does she want?

                                      VINCENT
                      To see me.

                                      FATHER
                      When?

                                      VINCENT

                      Midnight.

                                      FATHER
                      She always did have a taste for
                      the theatrical. I wish she'd
                      leave us alone.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          4


    9CONTINUED:9

                                      VINCENT
                      I'm surprised she hasn't come
                        sooner. I've wanted to see her.

        He and Father exchange a significant look.Father nods
          resignedly and withdraws from the chamber.Vincent regards
        the note once again.

                                                LISA (0.S.)
                        Come and see me at midnight. Our
                        special place. Lisa.

          Vincent eyes lift from the words as if seeing into a time
        long ago.

                                      VINCENT
                                (softly)
                        Lisa...

  10 INT.GREAT HALLYOUNG VINCENT'S POV10

        Two decades ago. A single lantern hangs from the ceiling,
          sending shards of flickering light into the dark recesses of
        the hall. And young Lisa dances near, a vision of soft
          sensuality in her gossamer dress, which catches and holds the
        light, as she turns closer and closer... For a second she is
        still, and her full face turns toward us, flawless and
        alluring, but before we can drink it in, she moves away
        becoming beautiful motion again.

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


  11INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT11

        Moving with Vincent as he walks slowly through the tunnels
          heading toward the park entrance. His thoughts filled with the
          turmoil of reawakened memories of his teenage years.
          A voice enters his consciousness.

                                      YOUNG LISA (OVER)
                        ... I will dance for all the
                      world. I will dance for kings. But
                      I will be dancing only for you.


                                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                                        5



    11CONTINUED:11

          The sweetness of these innocent words touches Vincent even
          now. The power and purity of first love. He moves PAST THE
          CAMERA, steering down a long tunnel.

                                                                      CUT TO:


    12INT.LINCOLN CENTER - OBSERVATION CHAMBERNIGHT12

          Vincent arrives in this small chamber, hidden underneath the
          first balcony. Some old theater seats are stacked against one
          wall, and a thin rectangular grating runs along another near
          the ceiling. The chamber is empty, and after a beat, Vincent
          steps up to the grating, looks through it.

          The empty performance hall.Rows of empty seat, and
          finally the empty stage.

          As he pulls away from the grating... and begins to wait.

    15LATER15

          Vincent is still waiting. A part of him idealizing this woman
          from the past. Yet an equal part remembering the pain and loss
          he also felt. And it is this second part that now impinges
          upon his memory. First come the sounds.

    16INT.FATHER'S CHAMBERDAY16

            A fifteen-year old Vincent, head bowed, youthful heart
          filled with guilt and recrimination, sits before Father. Who
          holds an equal measure of guilt in his own heart.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                                          6.

                      She went above with a helper. To
                        a dance school.

                                      VINCENT
                      No.

                                      FATHER
                      It's best for her. It's what
                        she's always dreamed of.

                                      VINCENT

                        What have I done, Father?

        After a harrowing, uncertain beat:

                              (denial)

        Vincent's eyes refocus on the present. Lisa is long overdue,
        and Vincent pulls her note from his cloak -- wondering where
        she could be, and why after all these years she has chosen to
        see him again. He elects to continue waiting for her.


                                                                  CUT TO:

        Catherine looks at Vincent with concern. This message from
        the past has clearly affected him...

                                      VINCENT
                      A message in the night... It said so
                      little -- and yet I could feel the
                        urgency, her need.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                            7.

                          But she never came...

                                VINCENT
                          No. It's almost as if I imagined it.


                                        CATHY
                          There's a touring company here
                          now. She might be with them...
                                (a beat)
                          Your memories must be strong.

                                        VINCENT .
                          She left us so many years ago. We
                          heard of her successes. Helpers
                          would bring us news.

                                        CATHY
                          I saw her dance once...

            Vincent looks at her, waiting for more...

                                        CATHY
                          It was truly inspired.

                                        VINCENT
                                  (nods, faraway)
                          ... Yes.

                                        CATHY
                          Did she leave the tunnels in order to
                          dance..?

            Vincent has no immediate response...

                                        CATHY
                          To follow her dream..?

                                        VINCENT
                                (a long, troubled beat)
                          That is not why she left --
                          although, it might have been a
                          reason in time...

                                        CATHY
                          Why did she leave?

                          ... Because I loved her.

                                                                      CUT TO:                                                                                          8.


  19INT. THEATRE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT19

        Cathy makes her way through a bustle of post performance
        activity as dancers mill about on their way to the dressing
        rooms. They step over cables and around flats as stage hands
        break the sets and set up for the next day's performance. Two
          members of the Corps de Ballet, JILL and BETH, are approached
        by MARIE, the wardrobe mistress, carrying an armload of
        costumes. She's a blustery,gregarious, motherly sort.


                                      MARIE
                              (to the dancers)
                      Come on girls, I need those
                        costumes.

                                      JILL
                              (to Marie indicating
                                her costume)
                      Do you think you could take
                      this in on the side?

                                      MARIE
                        What? So you can split the seams
                      next time you eat lunch? I'll
                      be here till three in the morning
                      just fixing the damage you did
                        tonight.

        She grabs Jill's skirt, holding up a tear in the material.

                                    MARIE
                      No go on, both of you, get those
                        costumes to wardrobe.

                                      JILL
                      Okay, okay.

        Jill and Beth saunter off.

                                      MARIE
                              (to herself)
                        Honestly, you'd think I had
                        nothing better to do.

        Cathy catches Marie's attention.

                                      CATHY
                        Excuse me. Can you tell me where
                        Lisa Campbell's dressing room is?

        Marie points down a side corridor.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                            9.


    19CONTINUED:19

                                        MARIE
                        Sure, honey. She's holding court
                        right down there. Third door.

                                        CATHY
                          Thanks.


    20INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT20

          Cathy walks past the other dressing rooms as dancers in various
          stages of dress and undress come and go along with bits of
          their conversations. "That stage is like a rock, must be cement
            underneath." "I think I'm getting that solo in 'Sylphides.'"
          "Yeah, sure. You and everybody else Victor's dating." Cathy
          reaches Lisa's dressing room. The door is ajar.



    21INT. DRESSING ROOK - CATHY'S POV - NIGHT21

          As Cathy stands in the doorway she sees Lisa at her
          dressing table, surrounded by flowers. She's in a robe but
          still wearing her stage makeup. An elderly, dapper man,
          FRANK, hovers over her, admiring...

                                        FRANK
                        I've seen you every time you've
                          danced here.

                                        LISA
                        Every time?

                                        FRANK
                          As far as I know...

                                        LISA
                                  (playing with him)
                        And which performance was your
                          favorite?

                                        FRANK
                          Without question: Giselle.
                          December 23, 1978.

          Lisa smiles at his ardor.Then, wistfully:

                                        LISA
                          I was only twenty-two.

                                        FRANK
                          May I say, you're just as
                          beautiful now, Miss Campbell.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)                                                                                          10.

                        And thank you for the flowers.

                                        FRANK
                                (bowing)
                        Thank you Miss Campbell.

          As he graciously leaves...

                                        CATHY
                        May I come in?

                                        LISA
                        Please&

                        You danced wonderfully tonight.

                        Do you come to the ballet often?


          As Lisa takes her costume and hangs it on the rack.

                                        CATHY
                       As often as I can... Actually I'm
                        here for a friend... a friend of
                        both of ours.
                                        LISA
                        Oh?

                                        CATHY
                          Vincent...

          The name hangs in the momentary stillness of the room, then
          Lisa slowly turns to Cathy.

                                        LISA
                                  (guarded)

                        You left a message... He waited
                        for you. He was concerned...

                                                                        (CONTINUED)                                                                                        11

                      Did he send you?

                                      CATHY
                      I said I'd try to find you...
                      and see if everything was all
                      right.

        Lisa says nothing. An awkward pause. Cathy realizes that Lisa
        would understandably be skeptical of her...

                                      CATHY
                      Vincent cares for you very much.
                      Know that if you need him, he'll be
                      there for you.

        Lisa begins to soften, but still reveals very little.

                                      LISA
                              (hesitant)

                                      CATHY
                      Yes.

                                      LISA
                      Tell him, I'm sorry. I would have
                      come, if I could.
                              (then)
                      Are you a helper?

        The door pushes open behind Cathy, and Collin silently
        steps in... unseen by Cathy, but visible to Lisa who
          immediately changes the tone of their conversation...
        glossing it over with charm and ease.

                                      LISA
                              (lightly)

                      wanted to say hello while I'm

                      Come in, Collin.

                      Collin, this is Cathy Chandler. We
                      went to school together. Cathy,
                      this is Collin Hemmings.

                      How do you do.

        Collin regards Cathy with a level gaze. Then, more a quest for
        information than casual conversation...

                                      COLLIN
                      So you went to school together.
                      Here in New York?

        Cathy glances at Lisa fleetingly instantly sensing her
        tension. Then, to Collin...

                                      CATHY
                      Yes...

                        Brookfield School of the Arts, of
                        course.

        Cathy smiles, keeping up the pretense while trying to sense the
          undercurrents.

                                      CATHY
                              (quickly, to both)
                      Well you probably have plans and I
                      don't want to keep you. I've got to
                      be going anyway.

              Cathy starts for the door.

                      I go.

                        That would be great. We can catch
                        up.
                                (to Collin)
                        Nice to meet you, Mr. Hemmings.

          Collin just nods as Cathy leaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:


    22INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT22

          Cathy closes the door behind her. She looks back at the
          dressing room, troubled, trying to decipher Lisa's behavior.

                                                                    CUT TO:


    23INT. MICROFILM ROOM. DAY23

          CLOSE TERMINAL SCREEN. We SEE a news photo of Lisa dancing the
          lead in "Les Sylphides" with the Paris National Ballet. The
          caption reads: "Lisa Campbell enchants Paris."

          The film blurs forward to a picture of Lisa on the arm of an
          Italian Count. The caption: "Will dancing's darling add a
          Count to her conquests?"

          The images blur forward again and stop. The scroll moves down
          page 3 of a newspaper to a small review. "Lisa Campbell, in a
          less than inspired performance, disappointed this reviewer once
          again..."

          Cut to a photo of Lisa on the arm of a distinguished looking
          man. The caption: "Lisa Campbell, here with London financier,
          Edward Forsythe, quits London Ballet. Replaced by rising young
          star."


    24INT. LISA'S HOTEL SUITE. NIGHT24

          A lavish suite, but Lisa seems imprisoned by it's very luxury.
          Although dressed for a party in a flowing dress
          (Mrs. Fielding's party), she paces restlessly, stopping only to
          look out the window into the dark night that hovers over
          Central Park. Her face mirrors her deeply troubled thoughts.
          She doesn't hear the knock at the door at first, only as it
          grows insistant does she turn to the door.

                                        LISA
                        Yes?

                                                                        (CONTINUED)                                                                                          14.


    24CONTINUED:24

          The door opens and Collin comes in. He stands near the
          door. Lisa smiles. Her face instantly a mask of charm.

                                        LISA
                          Yes, Collin. What is it?

                                        COLLIN
                          A change of plans. We're leaving for
                          London tonight.

          Lisa laughs, dismissing it.

                                        LISA
                          Don't be silly. I have three more
                          performances this week.

                                        COLLIN
                          They've been cancelled.

                                        LISA
                                  (disbelief)
                          What do you mean? I didn t
                          cancel anything? Who..?

                                        COLLIN
                          .... I suggest you take it up with
                          Mr. Forsythe when we get back to
                          London.

          Lisa tries to digest this.

                                        LISA
                                  (with growing anxiety)
                          But Why? Why would he do this? He
                          knows how important this is to me.


          She stops, regarding Collin suspiciously.

                                        LISA
                          What did you say to him?

                                        COLLIN
                                  (slight smile)
                          You overestimate me.

                                        LISA
                                  (beat, then pointedly)
                          Do I?

                                          COLLIN
                          I just do what I'm told. I
                          suggest you do the same.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)  24CONTINUED:(2)15

                      No! He can t do this to me.
                      He doesn t own me.


        Collin just smiles.Lisa looks away, out the window.


  25CLOSE LISA23

        As she stares into the park below, she gathers herself, her
        mind racing. Then her demeanor changes... 180 degrees.
          Chamelion-like, she now wears an expression of soft
        acceptance as she turns back to face Collin.


  26RESUME26

                                      LISA
                      Well, if I'm not going to dance, I
                      suppose I might as well go back.
                              (smiles)
                      It will be good to get home.

                                      COLLIN
                              (impassive)
                      I'm glad you feel that way.

        Lisa walks toward Collin with a gracious smile.

                                      LISA
                      You will give me time to change
                      and pack.

        Collin is not taken in.

                                      COLLIN
                      Of course...
                              (smiles)
                      I'll be waiting right outside.

        He leaves, closing the door behind him. After he goes, Lisa's
        facade fades and she stands, paralyzed with indecision. Then
        as a sense of defeat washes over her, she crosses to the
        dresser, opens a drawer and starts taking out some clothes. As
        she glances across the room she notices the door to the
        adjoining room. A moment's hope as she sees escape. She drops
        the clothes and goes to the door. She tries to open it, but
        it's locked from the other side. She turns from the door in
        frustration, her mind racing. Momentum building. She has to
        get away. The window. She runs to it and pulls it open. The
        breeze sweeps in, washing over her like freedom. She looks
        out.                                                                                        16.


    27 LISA'S POV27

          A narrow ledge and a three story drop... but there is a fire
          escape 25 feet away near the corner of the building.


    28RESUME SCENE28

          Lisa ducks back inside, trying to quiet the rising sense of
          panic that grows within her.

          Lisa startled, whirls about, but sees that the door is
          still closed. Catching her breath...

                                      LISA

  29CLOSE LISA29

          There is no time and there are no choices left. She
          soundlessly creeps out the window onto the ledge.


  30EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE. NIGHT30

          Lisa huddles on the ledge, fighting back her fear as she
          glances down at the long drop beneath her. Her breath coming in
          gasps, as she struggles to her feet. Her fingers dig into the
          bricks of the wall behind her as she inches along toward the
          fire escape, deftly balancing on the marginal footing. She
          edges forward, cringing as she HEARS Collin knocking at the
          door. The wind gusts about her, billowing her dress and hair.
          Almost a gothic image as she traverses the brick 'tower.'



  31EXT. FIRE ESCAPE. NIGHT31

          Lisa stretches her trembling fingers for the iron guard rail.
          From her room the SOUND of Collin's knocking grows louder,
          more insistant. Clutching the rail tightly, she leaps over.
          Without pause, she lunges toward the stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:                                                                                          17.


    32HALLWAY OUTSIDE LISA'S ROOM32NIGHTINT.

          Collin stops knocking with the realization that Lisa is no
          longer in there. He bolts toward an adjacent exit landing, as
          we:

          As Lisa speeds downward. Lightly, her nimble feet a
          blur... a 'bourree'. Down one flight, two flights.

                                                                      CUT TO:

          Lisa struggles to release the ladder that drops to the street,

            platform, Lisa lowers herself over the edge.

          to her feet and races toward the street.

          Lisa runs desperately into the street, dodging traffic as
          cars screech to a halt and swerve to miss her, horns blaring.
          Lisa runs into the park and disappears in the trees, just as:

            rounds the corner to the fire escape landing... but Lisa is
          nowhere in sight. He looks up, spitting mad, at the curtains
            billowing from Lisa's window.

                                                                      CUT TO:                                                                                          18.

              Father, Vincent, Mary, Samantha and a DOZEN TUNNEL DENIZENS
            are listening as Lisa charms with tales of her travels. Lisa
            does present an enticing picture with her beautiful dress and
              charming manner. Samantha is wide-eyed with wonder. Sitting
            close to Lisa, she soaks it all in, but Father is reserved,
              uneasy. Vincent sits somewhat apart from the others.

                            beautiful. Like dancing in a

                            be a ballerina?

            Lisa smiles wonderfully at Samantha's innocence.

                            I loved it here, Samantha. Without

      He leads her around a dank corner, her white dress whisping
        behind her.

      They arrive at a narrow passageway, where a gaping hole in
        the tunnel wall leads into utter blackness. Vincent regards
      Lisa for a beat before stepping through the hole into the
      base of a dark well. Lisa hesitates outside.

                                    YOUNG VINCENT
                      Don't be afraid.

      He reaches out to her.

                      I'll go first. You follow.

      And he begins to climb. Lisa watches his dark shape ascend into
        the darkness. After a while, she can only hear him, the gentle
        clink clink of heel against iron. Then silence.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          23.

          From way above comes a voice.

                        Your turn.

            Tentatively, Lisa reaches forthe third rung, and with a
          deep breath starts climbing.CAMERA MOVES WITH HER as she
          lifts herself rung by rung upthe curving wall.
            Three-quarters of the way up, she falters -- unableto
            continue.

                                        YOUNG LISA
                        I'm scared.

                                        YOUNG VINCENT
                        You're almost there. You can do
                        it. Don't look down.

          Lisa looks down at the bottom of the well, way below her. A
          vertigo swims in her head. Her grip loosens on the iron
          rung... and she's about to fall, when Vincent's strong hand
          thrusts into the frame, grabbing her arm, pulling her to
          safety.

            Together, they sit on the ledge at the top of the well,
            breathing hard at their close call.

                                        VINCENT
                        You're safe now.

                        Should we go back?

          Lisa peers over the edge back where they came from.

                                        YOUNG LISA
                        I don't think so...

          Closer to the surface, Vincent and Lisa walk with greater care,
          more quietly. Up above them, there's a faint RUMBLE. But it's
          not a subway. Vincent puts up his hand to stop Lisa. He turns
          towards her, and motions for her to be still.


            Together, they listen to the APPLAUSE from the theater above
          them. And then the first strands of the orchestra playing
          the overture to Swan Lake.

          Vincent leads Lisa into the chamber. He pulls two boxes up
          against the wall, and together he and Lisa stand on the boxes
          and peer through the grating. After a moment, Lisa turns to
          look at Vincent, her face transformed by joy. She mouths the
          words: "Thank you." Vincent regards her with love. She turns
          back to the grating to watch the ballet. Vincent continues to
          watch her for a beat, and then also turns his head toward the

                          I knew the name sounded familiar.
                        Buddy of mine over at Justice
                          mentioned him.

                        Some kind of international arms
                        broker, I think. Kind of guy plays
                        golf with Ollie North on the

                        I remember running through the
                        tunnels as a girl. So dark. So
                        fast. And I always ran towards the
                        light, the blinding light...

          Lisa smiles and continues walking a few paces before
          stopping to face Vincent.

          Without a word, Lisa turns and hurries off down the tunnel.

          direction.

        Father paces, trying to restrain his anger over the news
      that Vincent has just brought.

                                    VINCENT
                      We have a responsibility to her...

                      To help her face her problems,
                      yes. not to hide from them.

                                    VINCENT

                      This was her home.

        Father's looks away from Vincent's probing look, ashamed by
        his outburst.

                      Why, Father? Why do you still
                      hold such anger toward Lisa?

                        Seventeen years, and nothing has
                        changed since you sent her away.

                        I never sent her away.

                                      VINCENT -
                      But you did!

                                      FATHER

                        sake! Don't you understand?

        The velocity of their exchange has taken them to a new level
        of honesty... and the consequent pain is evident in Vincent's
        voice.

                                      VINCENT
                      ... Protect me?

                      But I shared those dreams.

                                      FATHER
                        Yes... for a time. But dreams
                        can't live in the imagination
                        forever. They become hopes...
                        possibilities.

          Vincent softens with understanding. Father regards him,
          remembering with sad, tender emotion.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        32.

69 INT.GREAT HALLDAY69

ANGLE STAIRCASE as Vincent slowly descends the stone steps and
enters the dim, empty hall. He stands for a long, thoughtful
moment at the foot of the stairs. A soft, warm light begins to
appear on his face from some unseen source. Music eases in,
haunting, lyrical ("Apollo" of "Meyerling" perhaps) as Vincent
turns toward the light.

(FLASHBACK)


70INT.GREAT HALL70

A single torch from a wall sconce sends flickering light
against the rocky walls. Young Vincent stands at the foot of
the stairs, watching Lisa as she dances... a vision of soft
sensuality in her gossamer dress, lost in the music, in
herself, in her fantasy. Then, Lisa sees him, their eyes
locking for just a moment... as she continues to dance.


Yet her movements seem to beckon Vincent closer... and he
cannot help but move toward her. Lisa dances near, resting her
hand on Vincent s shoulder as she balances in an arabesque, and
their eyes lock...

                          VINCENT
            You are so beautiful...

He raises his hand to touch her, but Lisa turns away,
moving behind him. Vincent turns, but she spins away from
him again... back into the center of the light, her lithe
silhouette casting graceful weaving shadows on the walls.


71 ANOTHER ANGLE71

Entranced, almost beyond himself, Vincent moves closer to
her... to the sensual image that entices... lures. She dances
around him, brushing past, laughing gently. He turns his head
as if to follow her sweet elusive scent.

Now Lisa turns and runs straight for Vincent, taking to the air
just as she is upon him -- trusting him completely as Vincent
lifts her high, her arms forming a graceful arch overhead. He
holds her aloft for a long moment... then easing her slowly
down as she lowers her arms around him. Their bodies are inches
apart, pressed close. Lisa's bare shoulders glisten.                                                                                        34.


  72 CLOSER72

        Their faces almost touching... as their lips brush... then
        brush again... then hold. The passions of youth rising...
        until Lisa suddenly pulls away and regards Vincent with
        a flicker of disgust: as if seeing his strange presence for
        the first time.

                                      VINCENT
                        Lisa...?

        (NOTE: over the following sequence, the music grows more
        strident, the angles sharper, the cuts quicker...
          surrealistic.)

        Pulls away sharply, straining to free herself from
        his grasp.

        holds on, as if trying desperately to regain the sweet
        promise of only a moment ago, his eyes imploring her to

      as she twists away violently within Vincent's grip, his fingers
        slice through the sheer fabric of her dress, into the delicate
        flesh of her shoulders and back. From the force of her efforts,
        Lisa falls to the ground with a scream. She pulls herself
        across the floor, away from Vincent, before getting to her feet
        again. Then she notices: touches the blood as it soaks into her
        dress: looks up at Vincent, her face reflecting a deeper horror
      as she backs away, and turns to run...

        Lisa and Vincent are very close now. Closer than they have been

                                      VINCENT
                                (exploding)
                        Catherine nearly died tonight
                        because of your selfishness! And I
                        almost lost the one person who means
                        everything to me!

        The power of Vincent's emotion overwhelms Lisa. She tries to
        get past Vincent, but he stops her. She doesn't look at him.


                                      LISA
                      Let me go...

                                      VINCENT
                              (powerful)
                      No! This time you will listen... and
                      you will hear me!

                                      LISA
                        You're frightening me...

                                      VINCENT
                      You have only yourself to fear.
                            Your cowardice. You surround
                        yourself with illusion... but
                        illusions fade.

        Lisa still averts her face.Tears begin to well inside,
        but Vincent is unrelenting.

                                      VINCENT
                      When you can no longer dance to
                        enchant the world, what will you
                      do? Will you cling to whoever
                      will have you?! Is that all
                        you're worth?

        Lisa wipes at the tears she can no longer contain as she backs
        away, sitting on the bed. Vincent's rage is tempered by her
        anguish, his tone softens...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        43.

                                        VINCENT
                        Beyond the chaos of dreams lies
                        a world rich with possibilities...
                        but only if you first acknowledge
                        the pain you're feeling.
                                (then)
                        Because without that pain... we
                        can never truly know happiness.

          Lisa's tears are quieting as she listens, although she
          still cannot look at Vincent.

                                        VINCENT
                        There is much I would change if I
                        could, but... we must accept the
                        past and learn to grow beyond it.


          Lisa looks down in silence.A moment as Vincent moves
          slowly to her side.

                                        VINCENT
                                (softly)
                        Listen to your heart. It will tell
                        you what you need to know.

        He touches her shoulder gently. This time Lisa does not
          pull away, but turns slightly toward the softness of his
          touch. A beat as they both feel this moment of gentle
          healing.

                                        VINCENT
                                (a whisper)
                        I will always believe in you.

          Then Vincent leaves her. Lisa looks up and watches him
          go... her gaze lingering long after he is gone.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

          A throng of people mill about the front steps -- reporters,
          police, onlookers. Cathy is among them. "Think she'll show?"
          "She's already late." "No one's seen her for days." Then, a
          limo approaches and pulls to the curb. Instantly the moment
          comes alive as reporters surround the car with cameras,
          microphones. "It's her." "There she is."

      The back door opens and a suited man gets out: Lisa's
        LAWYER. He turns and extends his hand to Lisa, who steps to
      the curb beside him. She wears a tasteful black suit and
        smiles charmingly for the cameras as her lawyer tries to
        shield her and get her to the steps.
