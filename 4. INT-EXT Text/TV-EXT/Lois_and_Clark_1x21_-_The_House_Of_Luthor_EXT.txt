
    We are CLOSE ON Superman in flight, so close we see only 
    the red and blue-clad body, not the face, as he weaves
    lazily between the skyscrapers, out for a pleasure cruise.

    We slowly PAN to the chest emblem... but something's
    wrong.  Instead of the famous "S," there's a "LEX" on the     *
    yellow shield.  We MOVE to the face: it's LEX LUTHOR.
    He's smiling blissfully.  He looks down to see...

    levity to disperse.

               Please, Clark.  Get in.

    To establish a downtown highrise.



    Lois, Perry's jacket draped over her shoulders, is led 
    outside by-the rest of the gang.  Police cars and 
    personnel are everywhere.  Lois is still in shock.

               I've always been such a good judge

    Still shaky and pale, Clark steps to her side.  They look 
    at each other.  He holds out his arms... she moves into 
    them.  Suddenly, a police walkie-talkie delivers a loud 
    burst of STATIC.

    steps forward as if to fly... but can barely walk.

    Lois averts her eyes, buries her face in Clark's chest.
    The bouquet drops from her hand to the sidewalk.  Someone 
    running by steps on it.

               We'll start on the building next
               week, but first I thought we'd
               announce to the world we're back in
               business.
                     (beat, to Perry)
               I reconsidered your proposal.  I
               agree with you, Mr. White.
               Metropolis needs the Daily Planet.
               Besides, one more nail in Lex
               Luthor's coffin suits me fine.

    The group rushes to him; hand shaking and hugging all 
    around.

               Would you like to see the plans?

               Now, Stern.  Stern!  Wait just a
               doggone minute!

    Lois and Clark are left alone.

                             CLARK
                     (per the globe)
               I've never seen anything so
               beautiful in all my life.

    Lois looks at Clark, seeing him in a newfound light.

                             LOIS
               You never gave up.  On the Planet,
               on your friends, on me.

    Clark looks at her.

                             CLARK
               I couldn't.  You've just named 
               almost everything in the world 
               that's precious to me.

                             LOIS
               I don't think I've ever, _will_
               ever meet anyone quite like you.

                  LOIS                         CLARK

               No.  Not this time.
                     (beat)
               I'm sorry.  About a lot of things.
               I wanted to bring Luthor down, but
               I never wanted to hurt you.  I 
               should never have said anything... 
               about the way I felt toward you.
               It put you in an incredibly awkward 
               position.

                             LOIS
               No.  Clark, I...

                             CLARK
               The fact of the matter is, it 
               wasn't true.  I'm not in love with 
               you.

               I would have said anything to stop
               you from marrying Luthor.

    Lois tries to mask her disappointment.

                             LOIS
               Oh.  Well, if that's the way you
               feel...

                             CLARK
               I want the same thing you do, Lois.
               I want us to be friends, and 
               partners.  Forever.

                             LOIS
               Forever.

                             CLARK
               Now, what did you want to say?

               Oh, nothing.  The same.  What you
               just said.  Sort of.

    He hurries off.

                     (slightly put off)
               Sure.  Why not?  Go.  Run off and 
               disappear like you always do 
               whenever we're having a discussion.
                     (a sigh)
