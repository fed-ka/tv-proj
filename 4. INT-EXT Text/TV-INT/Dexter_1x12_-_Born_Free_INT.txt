                      He wouldn t have taken Deb unless he 
                        left me everything a clever monster

    CUT TO: Dexter removes the air conditioner cover and peers 
    inside.  Nothing.  CUT TO: Dexter, behind his computer, 
    checks his Craigslistad.   No New Messages.   Damn.  He 
    rises from his desk, turns around, and surveys his place.  
    Desperation mounting.  And then Dexter seriously gets busy.

    In a SERIES OF CUTS, he rips apart his apartment... flips 
    through photo albums... pulls up cushions... yanks out 
    drawers.  Dexter turns his tidy home upside down searching 
    for a clue from Rudy, when suddenly he hears something very 
    odd.  The golden voice of ANDY WILLIAMS, singing...

    SAVER dissolving through images of LIONS ATTACKING PREY.           DEXTER 112     "Born Free"     Final Draft     10/13/06       5.

    THROUGH THE MAGNIFYING GLASS

    We see a NEWSPAPER PHOTO of the cargo box where Dexter s 
    mother was killed, police gathered around.  The magnifying 
    glass slides to the corner of the container -- to reveal a 
    small IDENTIFICATION CODE painted on the side:  CBAN-3489.

    Dexter smiles.  As he jots down the number on a pad of 
    paper, there s a KNOCK on the door.  Dexter moves to the 
    curtain and peers outside.  What he sees makes him unhappy.

    A friendly UNIFORM OFFICER nods at Dexter and points to the 
    closed silver door.  Dexter reaches the silver door, pulls 
    it open, and enters --


    Once inside, Dexter stops to marvel at the chilly chamber of 
    death.  Stained blood containers line the shelves.  The

    The scene still bustles.  Forensics Techsswarm the loft.

                        Other than the obvious?  Lots of trace 
                        blood stains.  That s probably where 
                      he killed them all, but I d like to 
                        check the rest of the apartment before 
                        I go.

    LaGuerta nods.  Dexter turns to explore the loft, heads to 
    the living room -- and freezes.  Wonder on his face.  He 
    steps forward slowly.

    REVEAL a vintage BARBIE RECORD PLAYER, sitting on a shelf, 
    with a blonde BARBIE HEAD painted on the closed lid.  A  
    FORENSIC TECH bags items on the shelf.  Dexter steps over.

    Dexter, wearing his gloves, lifts the cover of the record 
    player.  There s a .45 on the turntable.  Again, it s  Born

    The Tech hands him a plastic bag and keeps working.  Dexter 
    peers through the plastic -- and sees a  50sBarbiewearing 
    an apron.  She holds her hand up in a wave.  PUSH INTO the

    Dexter hands the Barbieback to the Tech, trying to hide his 
    excitement as he heads out.


    We have no idea where or what kind of room this is.  The 
    window is card-boarded.  The room empty but for a single 
    narrow table at its center.  The walls are white plaster.

    The door opens as Rudy pushes Debra inside, blindfolded and 
    gagged, her hands duct-taped to her sides.  He switches on 
    the single, bare, overhead bulb.  

                                        RUDY
                        Down on the floor, please.

    But Debra won t go quietly into the good night.  She blindly 
    tears free of him and runs but hits a wall -- spins and runs 
    again, another wall.  She s in a dark hell with no escape 
    but keeps trying --

                        This is kindafoolish, Deb.

    But she keeps searching for an exit.  Rudy simply kicks the 
    back of her knees, she crumples to the ground.  Hard.  

    He then holds her face-down on the ground with a knee on her 
    back.  As he talks, he pulls a syringe from his pocket...  

                                        RUDY

    trying not to cry.  There s a 70 sera SKATEBOARD next to 
    them.  Dexter is back in a memory.  

                                        LITTLE BRIAN
                        That was the best wipeout.  You didn t 
                        even cry.  Next time you try my 
                        skateboard, keep your knees bent.  
                        Okay?

    Little Dexter nods bravely.  As Little Brian puts the 
    bandage on his knee, Little Dexter looks up and sees Dexter.  

                                        LITTLE DEXTER

    Before Dexter can react, Brian steps up behind him and 
    plunges a SYRINGE into his neck.  The boys, along with 
    everything else in the room, VANISH.  The room is now empty 
    like the rest of the house.

                                        BRIAN
                        I didn t want to do it this way.

    As Dexter slips into unconsciousness in his brother s arms --  


    LaGuerta hovers behind a COMPUTER TECH telling him what to 
    input, as Doakes talks on the phone.  Both work the case, 
    intensely focused, all too aware of the stakes.

    She storms toward Pascal s office.  Off Batista s smile --


    LaGuerta enters her old office, now occupied by Lt. Pascal, 
    and shuts the door behind her. 

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Fly-overs look good to the press, but 
                        they re not going to find Morgan.

                      It matters to Captain Matthews and he 
                        calls the shots.  
                                (then)
                        Look, I know you need to define 
                        yourself here, and putting me in my

                      of our own is missing and we shouldn t  
                        waste our time pissingon trees.

    Lt. Pascal looks at LaGuerta, summing her up.

                                        LT. PASCAL
                        I agree.

                        I also know why you were reassigned -- 
                      it had nothing to do with incompetence

    LaGuerta shakes her head, knows what this means.

                                        LAGUERTA
                      So you re going to ignore this lead.

                        ...neither does the captain.

    Off LaGuerta, surprised but starting to like this woman --


    Dexter sits behind the table, head slumped down.  Slowly, he 
    awakens to find his arms duct-taped to the arms of the chair 
    and Brian sitting across from him, drinking a cold beer.  A 
    KNIFE rests on the table.  Brian nods to the restraints.

                                        BRIAN
                        Nothing personal.  I just wanted to 
                      sit down with a beer before we got 
                        started.  You made that difficult.

    Dexter fights his way through the fog of the tranquilizer.

                        ...Sorry.

                      You never need to apologize to me,

                      you do.

    Dexter looks around the room, trying to orient himself.

                                        BRIAN
                        Looks just like it used to, doesn t

                        that.  So they locked me up.

    Dexter registers this.  Tries to reconcile it in his mind.

    Brian looks at his brother.  It s a shared moment, honest, 
    real.  Brian nods.  Then he picks up the knife, stands, and 
    slowly moves around the table toward Dexter.

                        Yeah.  Connect...

    He cuts the other arm free.  Brian holds out a hand and 
    helps the still shaky Dexter up.

                        with me.  Your real, genuine self.  It 
                        takes your breath away, doesn t it?

    Dexter s eyes drift over Brian s shoulder.

    DOWN THE HALLWAY

    He sees Little Brian and Little Dexter laughing, chasing 
    each other.  Dexter turns back to Brian.

                                        DEXTER
                                (honestly)

    The same darkened space we saw earlier.  In the middle now, 
    Debra lies unconscious on an operating table under a single-
    source light.  Plastic wrap covers her naked body and holds 
    her to the table.  A strip of duct tape stretches across her 
    lips and down to the table to lock her head still.

    The two brothers walk up to Debra and stop.

                                        BRIAN
                        I prepared her just the way you like.

                                        BRIAN
                      Of course not.  You kill because you 
                        have a craving.  A need.  But Harry 
                      had to rationalize your need -- make

                        Dammit, Dex!  You don t have a code --

    All the emotions that have been scratched in recent months 
    boil to the surface.  Dexter looks up at Brian, a lost soul.

    He means it.  And it s shocking even to Dexter.  Brian takes 
    Dexter s trembling hands and presses the knife into them.

                                        BRIAN
                      The first step starts now.  Come on, 
                        Dexter.  Little brother.  Take the 
                        knife.  Showtime.

    Brian turns Dexter s body to face Debra.  Dexter looks down.

                                        BRIAN
                      Are you ready?

                      But I won t kill Deb.  I m very fond 
                      of her.

                        Don t do this.  Not now.  You can t be 
                        a killer anda hero.  It doesn t work 
                        that way.

    Dexter just stares at Brian, unable to move.

                                        BRIAN
                        Fine.  I ll choose for you.

    Brian grabs the knife back.  As he raises it upward, Debra s 
    eyes flutter open... and meet Dexter s.  Brian thrusts 
    downward -- but Dexter catches his hands, stopping him.

                                        BRIAN
                        Dexter!

    The brothers struggle over the weapon.  Dexter spins Brian 
    into the wall.  The impact makes him drop the knife.  Debra, 
    eyes wide with fear, watches as Brian goes for the knife, 
    but Dexter stops him. Brian turns on Dexter, and the two 
    exchange a combination of skillful STRIKES and BLOCKS.

    The flurry ends with Brian knocking Dexter to the ground.  
    Before Brian can make a move for the knife, however, we hear 
    a car SCREECH to a stop outside and CAR DOORS SLAM.

    Brian steps to the window and peers out through a crack, as 
    Dexter climbs to his feet.

    FOOTSTEPS and MUFFLED SHOUTS approach.  Shooting Dexter a 
    loaded look, Brian races to the back of the garage.  He 
    opensa DOOR on the back wall and bolts through as --

    The side door BURSTS OPEN.  Doakes and LaGuerta push into 
    the garage, guns drawn.  Dexter, who starts releasing Debra, 
    points to the back door.

                        Back there...

    Doakes reaches the door and pulls -- it s locked.

    Doakes races back out the side door.


    Dexter and Debra sit side by side on the cot.

    She laughs softly but can no longer fight the tears.  Dexter 
    puts a tentative arm around her.  Debra surprises him by 
    hugging him, clinging to him like a lifeline.  This time 
    it s not awkward for Dexter.  He just holds her closer as 
    she starts to sob.

    She hangs up.  Tries to shake him off.  Turns to head into 
    the house.  But she pauses... and glances around a little. 
    No shoe in sight.  She even steps over and peers down the 
    side yard -- 

    -- thenstops, hating Paul, and hating herself for doubting.

    Rita returns inside, slamming the screen door behind her.

                        What did I just do?  I drove away a 
                        brother who accepts me... seesme.  
                      For an adopted sister who d reject me 
                      if she knew, and a foster father who 
                        betrayed me. 

    Agitated, Dexter rises and starts pacing.

                        That s what it was.  A betrayal.  The 
                        most important single fact about me -- 
                      I m not alone -- and Harry kept it

    Dexter lies sleeping on the couch, which he s made a comfy 
    bed.  He fell asleep with the TV on.  Some awful late-night 
    plays.  


    Brian enters and stealthily moves to the couch.  He looks 
    down at the sleeping Dexter.  Threatening.  Ominous.  But 
    this isn t his prey tonight.  Assured that Dexter is asleep, 
    Brian turns down the hallway.  He reaches the bedroom and

    Brian sees Debra still asleep, her naked leg and arm still 
    protruding from under the sheets, sexy and vulnerable.  With 
    a smile, Brian steps to the bed and pulls out his KNIFE.

    He glances out the door, where he has an eye-line to Dexter 
    on the couch, still asleep.  Satisfied, Brian raises the 
    knife -- and PLUNGES it through Debra s heart.  Strangely, 
    Debra s leg rolls off the bed and THUDS to the floor.  With 
    a frown, Brian yanks back the covers to REVEAL --

    -- prosthetic LEGS, ARMS, and a HEAD artfully laid out, with 
    a pillow in the middle, to look like a woman asleep.  Before 
    Brian can react -- a GARROTE swiftly wraps around his neck.  
    Dexter stands behind him pulling it tight.

    Brian tries to fight but can t shake Dexter s powerful hold.  
    Losing air, Brian falls to his knees.

                                        RITA
                        Good.
                                (kisseshim again)
                      Who knows.  You might even find I can 
                        handle the truth.

    Dexter smiles wistfully.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.) 
                        I wish that were true.
