    holding a blue drink in one hand and a butterscotch dipped

  feet are covered with matching hospital booties.

  Liz is there with the growing ranks of sick  TGS  STAFF and 
  CREW.  JENNA and TRACY enter, healthy and chipper.

                  Liz, great news.  Tracy and I have 
                  been chosen to get flu shots.

                  They said it was a flu shot but I 
                  know it was really truth serum.

                  It s not.  You will make things

  Tracy and Jenna move off.  Liz notices Jack talking to 
    Kenneth who s now showing clear flu symptoms; he s feverish 
  and weak.  Jack holds a clipboard.

                  Kenneth, we can only give shots to  
                  personnel we deem essential.  Your

                  I don t need a shot, Mr. Donaghy. 
                  It d be an honor to die at my post.  
                My only request is to be given the

                  man: wrapped in a Confederate Flag, 
                  fried, and fed to dogs.

  Liz confronts Jack.

                                LIZ
                  This is disgusting.  Two-tiered 
                  health care based on class is part 
                of why this country s such a mess.

                                JACK
                  Lemon, you re going to want a shot.  
                  Please just get it over with.

                                LIZ
                No, Jack.  I don t bail on my 
                  morals when it s convenient.

                                JACK
                  Self interest is the most moral 
                  defining principle of a society.  
                  People can t deny their nature 
                  indefinitely.  You ll cave.

                                LIZ
                Oh yeah?

  Liz turns and addresses the  TGS  staff and crew.

                  I say shots should be for everyone,  
                or for no one!  And that is why I 
                am refusing a shot!

    Everyone cheers louder.  Liz basks in the love of the people.

  Same scene.  Liz lounges.  WIDEN to reveal she s making 
    flirty eye-contact with BANYANI, a beautiful Filipino man.

  Liz sits in her dream vacation chair as  Magic  from Xanadu 
    plays.  She looks fantastic; her hair blows in the breeze and 
  she makes the tankoort work.  Suddenly, she sees him... 
    Banyani.  He s gorgeous.  They share a smile.  He approaches.

                                LIZ
                Oh, hello, Banyani.

                  Elizabeth.  I ve been counting the 
                  days until I could see you again.

  Liz laughs at nothing in particular.

                                BANYANI (CONT D)
                You are so beatiful.  Do you think 
                  tonight could be a special night?

  Liz reacts,  of course,  and stands.  A passing waiter hands 
  her an ice cream.  She moves to shove it in Banyani s face, 
  then thinks better of it, takes a huge messy bite and strides 
  off proudly, displaying odd tankoort bows and straps.

                                                                        FADE OUT.
