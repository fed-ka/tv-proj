          He has the computer on to a search engine about Sonny
          Elliman... we can see his picture displayed...

          He glances at the clock and frowns.  It's two in the
          morning.

                                (listens for a beat)
                        I know exactly where it is.  I'm

                                (hangs up)

          Johnny pulls a cloth cover over his bulletin board,
          covering it from prying eyes.  Again, he can't help but
          see the humor in the way he's acting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And there's the paranoia.

          As they move in deeper, Johnny walks around the entrance,
          touching the walls and support beams, trying to pick up

            something on the kids.

          Johnny touches a beam and...


  9A9AAGAIN IN A SPLIT REALITY VISION

          the ghostly four teens walk by him.  One of the girls,
          Kate, balances herself on the same beam Johnny just
          touched.

                                        DOUG
                        Oh man.  This is just like the
                        Indiana Jones ride at Disney Land.  

          Tom puts his arm around Erin, trying to cop a feel.  They
          kiss.  And their images disappear...


  1010JOHNNY

          moves in the direction the kids were going... Walt
          follows... but as they take a few steps... Johnny suddenly
          hears something odd... heavy, trudging FOOTSTEPS coming
          toward them... a lot of them, dozens maybe... he reacts...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You hear that?

                        Hear what?

          Johnny grabs the flashlight and shines it down the left
          branch of a Y intersection of tunnels...


          POV

          Nothing there... and the light seems to halt the sound of
          the trudging army briefly...


          RESUME

          ...but as he shines the light away from that tunnel, the
            footsteps begin again... and now Johnny looks over to the
          dark space in the tunnel without shining the light back
          there... and reacts as he sees --


  1111P.O.V. - THE DARKNESS SEEMS TO BE MOVING

            Something is materializing.  Johnny stares.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - ACT ONE - 10/11/02 PINK           9.

          ANGLE ON LEFT BRANCH: THE DARKNESS HAS EYES.

          PAIRS OF DISEMBODIED EYES seem to be drifting towards
          Johnny.  It's eery as hell.

          And then ancient worklights strung along the shaft wall
          GLOW into life, revealing:

          A LINE OF MINERS trudging out of the left fork.  Bone-
          weary.  Dirty-faced.  And, somehow, silently accusing.

          ANGLE ON RIGHT BRANCH: Simultaneously, the TEENS go down
          the right fork with a flashlight leading the way.  Their
          LAUGHTER is in stark contrast to the miners' grim silence.

          ANGLE ON FORK: These two lines criss-cross each other in
          an eery Busby Berkeley-esque cascade of people entering
          and exiting the mine shaft.  Johnny stands stock-still in
          the middle.

          To Johnny's surprise, a grim-faced MINER with bright blue
          eyes looks right at him.  This is ELI.  And from his
          expression, he doesn't like what he sees.

                                        ELI
                                (nodding)
                        Mister Smith.

          Eli walks by.  A second young miner, about 20, (STENGEL)
          with a distinctive scar under his right eye glares at
          Johnny as do the rest of the miners as they file past,
          anger smoldering in their eyes.


  1212RESUME SCENE

          Johnny looks off balance for a second.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This mine seems to know me by
                        name.

                                        WALT
                        What's that supposed to mean?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wish I knew.

          Johnny motions for Walt to follow him down the right fork,
          the path the kids took.          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - ACT ONE - 10/11/02 PINK          10.



          Johnny and Walt walk until a huge pile of rubble blocks
          their way.

                                        WALT
                        This cave-in looks recent.  

          Johnny looks up at the ceiling then bends down to touch
          the rubble -- 


  1414SMASH VISION:

          reverse motion as all the rocks rain upwards to the
          ceiling, as the kids scream, scatter to cover, followed
          by a flash of gas exploding, Johnny's vision speeding him
          to the cause of the flash... Tom about to light a joint...


  1515RESUME SCENE

          Johnny reacts.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Natural gas explosion.  The kids're
                        alive but they're separated. 

          Walt takes that in, realizing their job is only getting
          more difficult.

          A sudden RUMBLE sends more dirt and rocks raining down
          from the ceiling.  Johnny and Walt scramble to get out of
          the way.

                                        WALT
                        That explosion probably
                          destabilized this whole place.

          Johnny looks around the mine.  He feels it looking back.
          Again, it seems to BREATHE...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  It's awake alright.  

                                        WALT
                        We gotta get Search and Rescue in
                        here.

          Walt tries his walkie-talkie, it's useless underground. 
          The two men reluctantly head out of the mine.  Johnny
          pauses as he sees seventy-five year old message carved
          into a wood beam.  It says: DEATH TO JOHN SMITH.  Off
          Walt's reaction...

          Johnny, Walt, Collier, and the two RESCUE TEAM MEMBERS
          search the mines.  They're deeper in, following the rails
          of an old mining cart track.  Flashlights, lanterns, and
          helmet lights are the only source of illumination.  A
          VISION voice yells in his ear, scaring the shit out of
          him...


  2525RAMP TO HIS FACE...

          Johnny hears a huge explosion that seems to ROCK the mine
          for him.  Johnny struggles to keep his balance...

                        Yeah.  Just walking on some old

                        More like walking on a graveyard.

          Johnny takes off his helmet and wipes off his forehead. 
          They've been at this a while.

                                        COLLIER
                                (to his team)
                        I need this post reinforced before
                        we go any further.

          Collier taps the helmet in Johnny's hand.

                                        COLLIER
                        Wear it.  I don't intend to let
                        this mine take any more souls.

          As Collier's men put on protective headgear, working
          quickly to reinforce the beam, the others take a break.

          Johnny sits down on the rail... and as he does, he hears
            a SQUEAK.  It sounds like fingernails on a blackboard. 
          He turns his flashlight up the rail toward the sound...


  2727ANGLE

            Suddenly, out of the darkness an ore cart comes BARRELLING

          Their faces are covered with protective gear.  But their
          EYES ARE UNMISTAKABLY THE EYES OF THE MINERS (One should

                        Or maybe the mine just doesn't
                        like you, son!

          He laughs deep in his chest... trudges forward... Johnny
          glances at Walt...



          As they climb down... (note: remember Quint's monologue
          about the USS Indianappolis and the shark attack in Jaws?

                        How many died here, Collier?

                        well, they were trying for a new
                        production record...  Thirty-one
                        miners - over twice the usual
                        crew number - were in the Four
                        Cross Cut North section.  At about
                        eight that night, fire broke out.
                        In a matter of minutes, smoke and
                        lethal gases had filled the whole
                          section. 
                                (beat)
                        The miners tried to break through
                        a wall but water flooded the
                          haulageway.  They were trapped. 
                        Only one choice for each man:
                        death by drowning or poison gas. 
                        Twenty-one went under the water. 
                        Nine died from burning lungs.

            Suddenly, A HUGE COLONY OF BATS EXPLODES AT THEM from a
          hidden hole, disturbed by the light.  Johnny and Walt,
          along with the other rescue workers, are literally pelted
          with bats and in the fracas, Johnny drops and loses his
          cane (as the show continues, his leg will show fatigue) 
          The men SHOUT and wave the bats away.

          But in the flurry, Johnny waves off a bat and gets...


  3232AN EERIE COLORLESS BAT POV VISION:

            A lightning-fast bat's aerial P.O.V. zips deeper into the
          tunnels...

          We SWOOP through the tunnels in a dizzyingly fast
          continuous shot, winding down through a hole, whooshing
          through a tunnel, diving down a shaft, and finally coming
          to...



          Tom and Erin are huddled close together, exhausted and
          afraid as they wait for rescue.  As the bat P.O.V. heads
          straight for them, they start frantically swatting at the
          bats.  The vision ends as...

          The kids are in exactly the same position as they were in
          Johnny's vision.  But, now we see that they're at the
          bottom of a crevice.  Tom has his shirt wrapped around
          his burnt arm.

          They move to her and immediately tend to their immediate
          physical needs, wrapping her in a blanket, checking Tom's
          burns.

          WHISPER to him, easing from conversational to accusatory.

          A dark heavy drop DRIPS down on his face from the ceiling.
          Johnny wipes it away and looks at his hand...

          More blood drips down onto his face from the ceiling.
          Johnny looks around.  There's blood trickling down from
          several cracks in the ceiling.

          He snaps out of the vision.

          And a DROP DRIPS on his face.

          With a horrifying sense of premonition, he wipes his face.

          Johnny and Walt reach a four-way intersection.  For a
          second, they're not sure which way to go, but something
          catches Walt's eye.  It's an abandoned flashlight.  As
          Johnny picks it up...

          Doug is lost in the darkness, hungry, cold, and completely
          disoriented from the lack of light.  But he hears Walt
          calling out to him.

                        Here!  I'm here.

          Doug finally sees a sliver of light. It grows brighter as
          Walt and Johnny approach.

          Dust everywhere.  It's pitch black.  As our eyes adjust
          to the dim light, we see clouds of dust hanging in the
          air.  Johnny moves back into the cavern to find Walt.
          He's partially pinned under the rubble.  He's lost his
          helmet and his head is bleeding.  He does not look good.

                        Yeah, you did, man.  Stay still.

          Johnny tends to Walt as best he can.  He takes out his
          medkit and tries to stop Walt's bleeding head wound.

          Doug helps Johnny clear away the debris trapping Walt.
          Doug finds Walt's smashed walkie-talkie.  Johnny tries to
          get a signal, but it's beyond repair.

          FADE IN:


          Johnny moves alone through the mine.  He comes to
          passageway marked in ancient letters:  4XCN.

          The old wooden posts CREAK as the earth shifts. Water
          DRIPS.  And the air continues to move through the mine in
          pulses, like BREATHS...

          As he braces his hand against rails along the way, he
          hears the voices of the men who died here...

                                        ELI'S VOICE

                        Fire in the hole! 

          The mine shakes with the sound of an explosion...

          Johnny turns to see --

          Johnny in the foreground as the smoke seems to sweep over

          Johnny moving through the darkness... hears the sounds of
          the men trying to cut through the wall... and now ahead
          he sees --          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - ACT FOUR - REV. 10/15/02 YEL     43.


6262A VISION - A FLOOD OF WATER RUSHING THROUGH THE WALL ON
          TOP OF MINERS  

          Johnny again in the foreground as they yell... and it
          quickly disappears... leaving him in darkness... but one
          last voice echoes through...

                                        ELI'S VOICE
                        Die John Smith!

          Johnny's eyes narrow.



          Johnny turns a corner and sees a frightening sight. The
          tunnel just disappears into a mirror-still body of water... 

          Johnny removes his coat.  He grabs a glow stick, snaps it
          on.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (psyching himself up)
                        You'll find air.  This place loves

                        You're talking to yourself again.

          Johnny wades into the water.  It's freezing.  He takes
          deep, lung-expanding breaths and then... DIVES IN.



          Johnny swims through the murky blackness.  It's spooky as
          hell.  There's no light, no sunshine to guide you to the
          top.  In fact, it's hard to tell which way is up.

          Johnny feels along one side of the tunnel to keep himself
            oriented.  The glow stick provides only a weak flickering
          beam of light.  He passes through a low passageway that
          is covered with water...



          And then his head breaks the water's surface. But, it's
          only a small air pocket at the top of the tunnel.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Kate?!

          The only sound comes from water lapping against the edges
          of the cavern.  Johnny treads water to stay afloat as his
          eyes, adjust ...

          JOHNNY'S POV: IT'S BLURRY, INDISTINCT. THERE ARE WHITE
          SPOTS AGAINST A BLACK BACKGROUND.

          Johnny reaches out to the one of the white spots and
          touches...


          CLOSER - A HUMAN FEMUR

          He gasps in surprise.  In fact...


          ANGLE - JOHNNY

          is surrounded by human bones and pieces of skeletons.
          They float in the water and litter the shelves of rock
          nearby.

          And he has disturbed their long slumber. They CLACK
            together, almost as if they're speaking a long-forgotten
            language. There's a lot of them, they seem to be crowding
          the water, pushing him back down under the surface. (Think
          of Marion "attacked" by the skeletons in RAIDERS OF THE
          LOST ARK).



          As Johnny struggles to find his way back up, his hands
          brush the bones and suddenly, he's not alone in the murky
          water.  His VISIONS come to eery life (Note: Stengel should
          not be among the dead).

6868A JOHNNY FLASH 

          as he sees a DIRTY-FACED MINER eyes wide open in death
          staring at him underwater... arms floating as though
          reaching toward Johnny...


  6969OFF AN ULNA --


  7070ANOTHER JOHNNY FLASH 

          Another dead wide-eyed BLACK MINER seems to be reaching
          out for him...          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - ACT FOUR - 10/11/02 PINK         45.


  7171OFF A COLLARBONE --


  7272ANOTHER JOHNNY FLASH

          Eli, wide-eyed in death, seems to reach for him...


  7373RESUME JOHNNY

          as he bursts above the water... gasping for air, very
          close to being drowned... grabbing for anything at all...
          hands slipping on bones...  there is no way out above the
          water line... so his only choice is five back down below...



          swimming below the bones... toward another low passageway
          completely covered in water...  he goes through it...



          Kate is wedged into a corner, looking desperate as the
          water level rises, higher and higher.

            Suddenly, right in front of her, Johnny BREAKS the surface
          of the water, GASPING for air.

          Kate SCREAMS in surprise, but then she reaches out for
          him.

                                        KATE
                        Oh, thank-god...

          Johnny comforts her as best he can in the cramped space.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you hurt?

                                        KATE
                        I can't feel my fingers or toes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This water's pretty cold.

          Johnny reaches out and rubs her hands briskly with his
          own.

                                        KATE
                        Is Doug okay?  We were with his
                          brother--

                                        JOHNNY
                        They're all fine. Just waiting
                        for you a couple of passages
                        over...

                                        KATE
                        Is someone coming for us?

          Johnny and Kate both have to tip their heads up to keep
            breathing and talking.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Kate, we're gonna have to swim
                        out.

                                        KATE
                                (scared to death)
                        No, I can't.  We'll die.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know where to go.  It's not
                        far...

                                        KATE
                        No...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Take my hand...

          She does... he smiles... because he sees a better future
          for her now...

                                        KATE
                                (off his smile)
                        What...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know who I am, Kate?  My name
                        is John Smith.

                                        KATE
                                (beat)
                        The guy who sees things?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  And I'm telling you it's
                        gonna be okay.

          She looks at him, curiously.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's gonna be okay.

          She almost smiles.  Not quite.

                        Take some really deep breaths and
                        swim with slow, steady kicks. Got
                        it? 

                                        KATE
                        Okay. Don't let go.

          Johnny starts taking deep breaths. Kate follows suit.

                                        JOHNNY
                        One ... two ... three ... and go.

          Johnny and Kate dive down under the black inky water ...
