Quick cuts, seductive angles: 70 hot-air balloons rise over
a vast, green corporate campus. Their mylar skins are
imprinted with Outpost '98 logos; their gondolas are dressed
in Outpost-colored bunting.
18,000 Outpost employees cheer. They're spread out over
rolling lawns, amid Arabian tents and costumed Acrobats.
Over the balloon-dotted sky, the graphic re-appears: "The
coolest thing?"
DIFFERENT VOICE (DARYL)
It's the beverages.
A Programmer sits with two colleagues, drinking latts at
the edge of Lake Washington. MITCH, BERKELEY, '98
MITCH
Big companies are s'posed to be
impersonal.
MONTAGE: Programmers play competitive games at an Outpost
picnic; Toddlers play on computers in an Outpost Day Care
Center; Geeks confer at a diagram-covered whiteboard;
Employees listen/dance to the Seattle band we've been hearing,
on-stage, at the Outpost '98 launch.
MITCH (V.O.)
There's this myth that doing a start-
up is cooler. But there's no community
with a start-up. No permanence.
BACK TO SCENE: COFFEE HOUSE/TERRACE (CONTINUE TITLES)
One of Mitch's colleagues is nodding. DONNY, HARVARD, '97
DONNY
It bums me out when the media say
we're cultish, or whatever. Why?
'Cause we care about each other?
Donny didn't mean to sound so mushy. Nobody knows where to
look for a second.
MITCH
'Love you too, bro.
As they laugh: "The coolest thing?"
VOICE (TERRY)
I'll tell you what's not cool.
TERRY
How Gary gets this superbad rap.
MONTAGE of magazine covers (Newsweek, Vanity Fair, WIRED)
featuring Gary Boyd. They say, eg: "Who Owns Cyberspace?" On
a Time cover, he's composited by the Capitol Dome: "ROBBER
BARON OR VISIONARY? Outpost's Antitrust Woes"
TERRY (V.O.)
There's this prejudice against super-
smart people. People like Gary.
GARY (early 40's) reads a statement before a Congressional
Sub-Committee. His voice is pleasant but firm:
GARY
A kid working in his garage can create
the next Outpost, the new IBM. All
it takes is a great idea.
A bloated Senator looks hostile.
GARY
That's why nobody can have a monopoly
in a business built on ideas.
As we watch, CAMERA pulls back from the screen on which the
movie is being projected. REVERSE INTO:
Tilting down the neo-classical edifice, we read the name
etched over the entrance: WILLIAM GATES COMPUTER SCIENCE
BUILDING. We find Larry and Alice sitting on the steps.
LARRY (AT FIRST O.S.)
Alice? You gotta make him do the
start-up with Teddy and me.
ALICE
"Make" him?
LARRY
(thoughtfully)
You know what I mean.
As we hear Larry speak, we cut back into:
THE AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
The lights are on. Milo & Teddy stand by a table dressed in
Outpost bunting, laden with refreshments & giveaways:
mousepads, T-shirts, caps & books with the Outpost logo on
them (a simple contour drawing of a frontier outpost). While
most Students chat earnestly with Recruiters, Milo & Teddy
load their plates with pizza and tortilla chips.
LARRY (V.O.)
I'm not exactly worldly, but I'm the
Secretary of State next to him.
Milo puts some brownies on his plate.
LARRY (V.O.)
And they're all throwing this --
stuff at him. Stock options. Pay
packages.
Spotting a book on the table, Milo picks it up.
LARRY
I'm just screwed.
ALICE
(that's not true)
You know what he's like. He just
wants to work on stuff that's cool.
LARRY
You don't wanna move, do you?
ALICE
I can paint anywhere.
Larry looks at her: you didn't answer my question.
ALICE
I'd like to stay here, yeah. And I
kind of think he should be with Teddy.
THE AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
Milo and Teddy discuss the book almost joyfully. (We see a
page of code: utterly indecipherable.)
ALICE (V.O.)
I mean, nobody else can follow what
they're talking about half the time.
MILO/TEDDY
(under Alice)
'Could be a condition-variable in
the locking code -- If it didn't seg
fault, first!
ALICE
Maybe you shouldn't push it so hard.
About Outpost. No offense, you sound
insane.
LARRY
I can't help it. I feel like they'd
do anything to keep their --
ALICE
Anything? That's not even credible.
If he wants to go up there? To check
it out? I think you should encourage
him.
(seeing Larry's
incredulity)
It's his life. But everybody's
treating him like this -- valuable
object. You're hurting your own case.
Redmond drives his black Lexus 85 m.p.h. Danny leans forward
from the backseat.
DANNY
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
MILO
He's pretty tight with his family.
DANNY
We could move 'em up here.
MILO
He just likes to write code. He's
bummed there's so much secrecy and
competition, everybody trying to own
everything.
REDMOND
Who do you mean by "everybody."
Milo almost blushes. He makes an awkward segue.
MILO
So -- how far are we from the campus?
REDMOND
Oh we're not going to the campus.
Beyond a rocky beach, buildings are cunningly carved into a
wooded hillside. Glass walls are framed in rich wood. The
main house is 28,000 sq. ft. Then there's the guest house,
pool building, reception hall, library...
Redmond pulls up. A discreet Guard in a Mr. Rogers cardigan
recognizes him. The gates swing open.
They pull up by a Lexus SUV with a baby seat. Another Man in
a cardigan stands in the open front door.
MILO
Who's that?
DANNY
I think they call him the "Houseman."
'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
Milo just sits there, eyeing the monumental residence.
DANNY
Don't be nervous. The house is the
weirdest thing about him.
REDMOND
It's like he knows everybody expects
him to be this worldly, colorful
zillionaire. But he's just a guy who
likes software.
A block of floodlit "tract mansions," Taco Bell palaces of
the Valley's newly rich. Milo & Alice cross a vacant lot to
where the lights twinkle below. Their '89 Honda Civic is
parked nearby. Milo is excited.
MILO
If my dad'd leveled with me like
that even once... The weird thing
is, my fantasy he could somehow be
like the old Gary? It's his fantasy,
too.
ALICE
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
MILO
...But?
ALICE
Didn't you visit the campus?
MILO
I forgot. That's why you have to
help me decide.
ALICE
No way. You have this -- destiny.
MILO
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny
without you. My destiny would be
dying at 20. From eating --
ALICE
Don't bring that up. Like a different
girlfriend would'd've let you die?
MILO
(shrugs)
You saved my life in alot of ways.
He's sweet. She kisses him. He holds onto her.
ALICE
It's not just Gary that makes you
wanna go there? 'Cause it's a big
place. You might not even see him
again.
He'd hate to think that's true. But he manages a smile.
MILO
I know.
The Honda is loaded with luggage and boxes, some of which
are tied to the roof. Milo & Alice stow a final piece.
MILO
When's Brian coming for the TV?
ALICE
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for
Outpost to call. We'll leave it for
him?
As they head back in, they see a Toyota park at the curb.
ALICE
'Give you guys some time alone.
She continues inside. He waits, watches Teddy cross the
sidewalk to join him.
MILO
...You got my E-mail?
TEDDY
And your phone messages. You wanna
do what you do, it's not a crime.
MILO
Is that how Larry feels?
TEDDY
Uh. Not exactly.
A brown Buick parks behind Teddy's car. As they speak, a
rumpled, 50ish MAN in an off-the-rack suit gets out.
MILO
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
TEDDY
Hey, we got seed money for the
startup! A million-five!
Milo grins, he high-fives Teddy.
TEDDY
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.
(he gives Milo the
number)
You know what's the bad part? We
can't talk about work anymore. We're
competitors! The venture capitalists
made us sign like 100 confidentiality
forms.
MILO
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess
we'll find out what else we have to
talk about. Life stuff.
They embrace. It's awkward, but it's heartfelt.
Crane past identical, low, steel & glass buildings, amid the
vast lawns & fir trees... Past a building under
construction... To find Redmond's Lexus, cruising.
Milo looks out the window, Redmond gives the tour:
REDMOND
There're 20 buildings, I mean not
counting the Gyms, the Day Care,
etc.
The Day Care is a Michael Graves-looking building with a big
cartoon-dog sculpture on its roof, ears cocked to the sky. A
Teacher leads her little charges inside.
REDMOND
Gary's put millions in there. And
the people with kids? They're not
hotshot geeks, they're just payroll
clerks or whatever.
Two Men in suits, with briefcases, (conspicuous amid the
Geeks in jeans and T-shirts) enter Building #19.
REDMOND
You'll see alot of that: Department
of Justice goons snooping around.
The car pulls into a lot full of Miatas, BMW's, Boxters.
CLOSE ON - THE OUTPOST LOGO
THEN TILT UP TO SHOW:
The logo is of inlaid stone. Redmond & Milo walk over it.
Milo carries a box with some personal effects, including a
small painting. Redmond wears a photo I.D. tag.
REDMOND
So how'd you like the house?
MILO
His Snapples were in alphabetical
order.
REDMOND
(he laughs)
Well, he micro-managed the company
till it got too big...
(he opens the door)
'Guess he needs to micro-manage
something.
As they walk, Milo watches two Hardhats roll a spool of fiber-
optic cable into the building under construction.
MILO
What're they building?
REDMOND
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top-
secret, but everybody knows it's a
digital broadcast space. They see
the dishes on top, the fiber optics
going in.
MILO
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's
betting everything on the satellites.
REDMOND
You wanna survive in the software
business, you cover your bets... I
gotta say, this is the weirdest car
anybody ever requested.
They approach a 1990 Deux Chevaux, cheap but charming.
REDMOND
Oh, right. Your girlfriend's an
artist.
Two awe-struck Geeks see Gary through the window.
GEEK 1
He's been in there like an hour.
GEEK 2
Shit.
Milo sits alone, marking up pages of code as he eats. He
doesn't notice Lisa, standing with her tray.
LISA
Did you wanna be alone?
MILO
No. Please.
He indicates she should sit.
LISA
They just pushed up the schedule on
Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
MILO
"There is no second place." Plus
every time I get jammed-up, Gary has
an inspiration.
(looks at her, curious)
Is it like that with your counselor?
LISA
Mine's not the CEO. He barely
remembers to take a shower.
MILO
Right, right. But does he ever just,
like, hand you code?
LISA
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
MILO
(he smiles)
You're compulsive.
LISA
Mmm-more like -- I have a little
trouble. Trusting people.
MILO
Why's that?
LISA
Long story. Not that interesting.
She smiles charmingly to cover whatever she's feeling. The
more enigmatic she is, the more intrigued he is.
Milo and Lisa walk, eat ice cream out of paper cups with
Outpost logos. They laugh. We go nearer.
MILO
So, when you were talking about
wishing people were more like
computers. Was that then? Or now?
LISA
Then and now.
(when he looks at her)
But not right now.
She maintains eye contact. Her meaning is clear.
VOICE
Milo!
Milo turns, sees Brian (Stanford classmate, Outpost zealot)
give an envelope to a Guard at the door of #20; he trots
over to Milo, who is as flustered as another guy might be
having been found in bed with a girl.
BRIAN
Just dropped off a resume. Almost
got in the front door.
He looks at Lisa, back to Milo, wondering why he isn't being
introduced.
MILO
You're living here?
BRIAN
'Thought if I relocated it could
help my case. I'm writing programs
for the local public access station.
Where any whack-job with 100 bucks
gets his own show? God, does it suck.
(gives him a business
card)
Can you help me?
MILO
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
Seeing how flushed Milo is, Brian thinks he must have
blundered in on something. He starts to back away.
BRIAN
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
MILO
(watching Brian go)
'Forgot to introduce you.
(a beat)
I have a girlfriend.
LISA
That's great. I -- didn't know.
MILO
She saved my life.
The station is closed. Milo's car is parked, empty.
MILO (O.S.)
How's it going down there?
We find him, in an illuminated phone booth.
TEDDY (ON THE PHONE)
I've been hacking for five night's
straight, I'm really making headway.
INTERCUT WITH:
Through a window, we watch Milo traverse the quad.
GARY (O.S.)
What'd the girl say?
PHIL
There may be a little less trust
after your outburst.
We are
Desi and another Geek watch in astonishment: Gary walks Milo
to his car, his arm circled over Milo's shoulder. He seems
to be -- apologizing.
Milo comes eagerly up the path: can't wait to tell Alice
what just happened. He enters -- pulls up short. Alice is
waiting for him. She's white.
MILO
...What's wrong?
She doesn't know how to say it.
MILO
What!
ALICE
Teddy was killed last night.
MILO
What're you -- what?
ALICE
It was a hate crime.
Milo is staggered. She moves to him...
ALICE
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
He hangs onto her, for support.
Establish the funky building, vestiges of police tape on the
door, a limo and many cars parked out front.
A raw beautiful bluff. The sea stretches to infinity behind
a smaller group of Mourners. A LAY MINISTER intones the Lord's
Prayer.
Milo approaches Larry with trepidation. Larry nods, it's
okay. They hug each other. They walk slowly back toward the
cars.
MILO
I know you lost all his work. Maybe
I could come down here and --
LARRY
You are naive. Look at your employment
contract: you can't work anywhere
else in this field for at least few
years.
(he smiles sadly)
Not that I don't miss you.
MILO
Just thought his work should go on.
LARRY
He was on the verge of something,
too. He was gonna show us the next
day. He said "The answer's not in
the box, it's in the band." Know
what it means?
MILO
It's only meaningful when you've got
40,000 lines of code to back it up.
LARRY
Man, could he write code. Totally
elegant. He had his own style.
MILO
Those really weird, short lines.
They smile. For a moment, they've brought Teddy back to life.
Alice comes up from behind, to fetch Milo.
LARRY
Take good care of this guy.
Arriving for work, Milo sees Outpost flags at half mast.
Milo eats alone. Through the window, he sees Lisa inside.
She's eating alone, too. Gary comes trotting up.
GARY
Milo?
He is unclasping a manila envelope; he takes pages out.
MILO
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of
code there...
GARY
34,000. But they're real short lines.
'Just came out that way.
Seeing Gary's code, Milo knits his brow: it must be sort of
like -- Teddy's.
GARY
Been thinking about the push mechanism
in the handler. And it came over me:
it's in the wrong place.
MILO
(an uncertain smile)
The wrong place?
GARY
The answer's not in the box. It's in
the band.
Milo's smile freezes. As he stares at Gary, we zoom with a
reverse dolly so that the background retreats queasily but
Gary remains dominant in frame. For Milo, it feels like the
very ground is going out from under him.
Gary continues to explain, pointing at lines of code. And
Milo pretends to listen. But he can't even make out the words
Gary speaks -- he hears only a jumble of echoes.
Milo nods mechanically; he wants to scream. Or run. He
perceives, amid the echoes, that Gary is standing, smiling,
saying "See you later." And he's gone.
Milo touches the pages, like some talisman of Teddy.
LISA (O.S.)
Milo? You okay?
It strikes him she always shows up at these moments. He
gathers his wits before looking up.
MILO
Gotta go home. 'Think I ate something.
Pulling out of the lot, Milo seizes the car phone. He hits
HOME on the speed-dial. Gets a busy signal. Rings off. He's
about to press re-dial when he sees the Outpost logo branded
on the receiver.
He throws it down like it's contaminated.
Middle-of-the-day sounds: chirping birds, school children.
Milo pulls to the curb at a bad angle.
He fumbles with his keys. When he gets inside:
MILO
Alice? Alice!
He moves into the bedroom. He sees her through the window,
painting in the studio.
He stands outside the studio. Waits for her to look up. She
does. She smiles. Then she sees something's wrong. He waits
for her to come out here, where it's safe to speak.
He paces, agitated. She watches him. She's skeptical, but
doesn't want to appear unsympathetic.
ALICE
Are you saying you think they had
something to do with his death? Nelson
said it was an airtight case.
MILO
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe --
maybe they hired those guys.
ALICE
I can't see Outpost putting its
reputation in the hands of people
like that.
MILO
I don't know! I just know it was
Teddy's code. All these ideas flying
in from everywhere. You know how he
says "Any kid working in his garage
can put us out of business?" It's
like they know what every kid's doing.
ALICE
They hack into people's programs?
MILO
Nobody does work like this on-line.
It's in your PC, or in a mainframe.
Self-contained. They'd have to be,
like, watching people. Physically.
(he freezes)
Oh Jesus.
They've trooped back outside. She's worried she's indulging
his paranoia.
MILO
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's --
a surveillance post or something.
That's why they have the dishes on
top.
ALICE
You're scaring me. I think we should
just go.
MILO
Go where? You can't get away from
people like this.
ALICE
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking
about.
MILO
(it really hurts)
You think I don't know that?
ALICE
Milo. Why would he --
MILO
How should I know? "Solving a
problem," I guess. Or needing to
control everything. I don't know.
(can't think about it)
I've gotta get in there.
ALICE
Even if all this were true. There're
20 other buildings. All of them filled
with computers and --
MILO
It's the only one with dishes on the
roof. The studio's a front. That's
why they keep postponing its opening.
(muttered, obsessive)
...gotta get in there.
ALICE
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents
are all over the place. How could
they hope to hide a surveillance
post?
(as he mulls this)
And how can you get in there, anyway?
With the cameras and the swipe cards --
MILO
I can't just walk away!
ALICE
You can't just walk in, either.
MILO
They stop the construction work at
six or seven. The parking lot's mostly
clear by two or three in the morning.
Even the early Geeks don't get there
before five.
ALICE
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you
ever really noticed?
He knows what she's saying: he's unqualified for this, a
space-cadet. She tries to hold him. But he wriggles away.
MILO
No! I can't just keep my head in the
sand. That's how I got into this
mess.
He paces, he thinks. She watches him, worried.
MILO
I know how to get in there. But you've
gotta help me.
ALICE
(scared, reluctant)
...Whaddo I do?
MILO
So you believe me?
She can't lie. She shakes her head.
ALICE
Just tell me what to do.
BEGIN MONTAGE:
Alice parks in front of a drugstore. As she gets out of the
car, she looks around uneasily.
Milo walks the path between the two buildings, fiddling
nervously with the dummied swipe card.
Hearing footfalls behind him, he whirls: it's a Geek loping
to his car. He smiles. Milo smiles: waits, walks on.
Nearing #21, Milo looks around, making sure no one else is
around. His POV (panning): A Programmer works late, visible
through a lighted window in #20... The dog sculpture with
cocked ears sits atop the Day Care, its quizzical expression
seeming to wonder what Milo is up to... The Geek he just saw
racing by on foot now pulls out of the parking lot in his
James Bond BMW...
Milo arrives at the entrance. Heart pounding, he brings the
card to the slot. Will he trigger that awful alarm?
He slides the card, the door clicks.
Delbert comes out with his flashlight, heads across the clean-
swept path that leads to #21.
Through infra-red binoculars we see Milo come out, looking
left and right, to make sure he hasn't been observed.
VOICE (RANDY)
Well. Now he knows: nothin' in there.
We are
From a high angle, we track Milo, as he walks along the path
to a bench. The camera passes briefly behind a dark object
in the foreground (dog sculpture) as we track him.
QUAD - TIGHTER - CONTINUOUS
Milo sags onto the bench. He stares out, perplexed, suffering.
Then he knits his brow. He seems to be studying -- the ground.
Or rather the shadow stretched out in front of him: the
looming silhouette of the dog atop the Day Care.
He stands up, turns around. REVERSE ON:
The whimsical canine. Push toward it's ears cocked to the
sky... Then toward a single ear, framed by fur-brown concrete,
but with a smooth, concave inner surface of enamelled metal:
satellite dish.
MILO
(muttering)
...in a tree...
At the entrance, Milo applies the swipe-card.
Milo sits in his idling car, staring at his own house, up
the street. How can he go in there?
He puts the car in gear, does a U-Turn.
The Deux Chevaux is parked on the street outside a government
building. Not many people are around, yet. A Janitor hoses
down the sidewalk.
Milo comes up the path. He pauses as he nears the door: he's
not sure he can pull this off.
It's pouring. Milo stands outside, wearing a slicker, looking
in the window at someone.
They're in a bandshell. The rain falls heavily, drips off
the eaves. She holds the filament from Teddy's workspace.
MILO
It's easy to know who the smart geeks
are, the schools tell 'em. They upload
medical files, school records,
pharmacy files. They'd be happy just
to steal code forever. But when a
program gets close to fruition. Like
Teddy. He was almost there.
LISA
But why would they --?
MILO
You know. There is no second place.
And what's the risk? The killings're
undetectable, they're hand-tailored,
they make "sense." I mean, they're
in the information business. They
have scenarios for all of us, too.
In case we find out too much.
She's peering at him. He reads her mind.
MILO
I'm not one of them. Not trying to
"suss you out."
She wants to believe him.
MILO
They killed my best friend! I'm living
with somebody they pay to go to bed
with me. Can't you trust somebody
just once? I don't wanna be alone
here.
His plea is so ardent, his humanity so transparent. But she
can't quite do it.
LISA
I'm sorry, Milo... I'm sorry.
She smiles sadly as she backs away.
MILO
(forcefully)
I know why you're so secretive. Why
you won't let anybody near you.
(quieter)
I know what he did to you.
LISA
Oh yeah?
She tries to sound tough; there are tears in her eyes.
LISA
So that's in my -- file?
He wants to comfort her. He takes a step toward her. She
shakes her head: no.
LISA
Is that my -- scenario?
(when he hesitates)
Tell me.
MILO
They'd frame him.
LISA
(horrified)
He's out of prison?
MILO
(he nods)
They're already watching you. If
they had to, they'd give him this
drug that mimics an alcoholic
blackout. He'd wake up not even
remembering his "act of revenge."
She draws her hands to her face as the facade cracks. She
weeps silently. He moves to her, carefully, slowly, seeing
her fear, her trauma. He touches her shoulders. She tenses,
tries to back away.
LISA
No.
But he holds on.
MILO
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Slowly, he wraps his arms around her.
She remains tense for a moment, then yields, pressing her
face into his shoulder. The rain drums on the bandshell.
After a moment:
LISA
...Milo?
MILO
Hmm?
LISA
I always felt if a -- boy I liked
ever found out -- he'd run. He'd
think I was unclean.
MILO
No, no. Never.
She clings to him tightly, now, the wall of her mistrust
breached after all the years of pain, secrecy, shame.
A wide shot: they hold each other, alone in the storm.
VOICE (PHIL)
All his suspicions were allayed?
From across the highway (cars with morning commuters whiz
by) we see Milo pumping gas at a self-serve; Lisa fills-up
in the next lane. Ostensibly, they have run into each other
on the way to work. They are smiling, casual.
Only when we cut close do we see that their expressions bear
no connection to their words.
LISA
What about the FBI?
MILO
They've got this guy in the DOJ,
maybe others. We tell the wrong
person, it's over.
LISA
Who can we trust?
MILO
There's always a logical answer --
you just have to define the question.
She defines it:
LISA
How do you let go of a secret without
telling the wrong person.
She pretends to need help lifting her car hood: "a helpless
female." He comes over to help her.
MILO
We don't tell anybody.
(she's puzzled)
We tell everybody. At once. So there's
no secret left to protect. When
everybody knows, they don't dare
touch us.
Milo checks Lisa's oil for her.
MILO
Do we post it on the Net?
LISA
There're so many disinformation sites
about Gary already. Where he has
devil's horns or they crop him in
with Saddam Hussein.
Milo shows Lisa the oil stick. She nods.
LISA
The mainstream media. TV, or a
newsmagazine.
MILO
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot
of media conglomerates. Have to be
careful who we pick.
LISA
We could cross-reference a data base
on media ownership. But not on our
own computers. Not even at home.
MILO
Certainly not at my happy home.
He slams the hood.
Establish the humble building, in a Park.
Milo and Lisa walk in the park outside the library, thinking
it through.
MILO
We can't just assume they're standing
by to receive Skywire 12 months from
launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
LISA
A what?
MILO
It's how on-line services push logos
they wanna sell you. You don't ask
for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to
work on it somewhere besides my office
or my house. And then the quality of
the broadcast wouldn't exactly be
digital, that's 12 months away.
LISA
But they'd still get the idea, right?
MILO
You'd have to design a graphic
interface to make the data pop. Maybe
some audio, too. To tie it all in to
Gary. How long would that take you?
LISA
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a
concept, it's maybe three day's work.
MILO
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We
have to do this fast.
LISA
Before they kill somebody else, too.
MILO
(a new wrinkle)
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's
house. To get the satellite positions.
LISA
You mean -- break in?
MILO
I don't know --
LISA
And what if the broadcast dishes on
top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said
the place isn't finished.
The complications pile up. They walk. They think.
LISA
I'll go look.
(when he looks dubious)
They'll just have a few more pictures
of me snooping around.
They come to a fountain and balustrade at the edge of the
park, stop walking.
MILO
(looks at her)
Why were you so careless?
LISA
I thought the worst they would do is
fire me. Who knew they took
termination so literally?
Gallows humor. What a game girl. He's nuts about her.
MILO
Why were you snooping in my office?
LISA
Oh.
(she gets bashful)
I liked you. I was checking you out.
He kisses her. There are no constraints now, there's no
"adulterous" guilt: they kiss with a passion deferred.
Close on a satellite dish. We pan from the base of the dish
to the wiring: a cable is fused to a component box.
Lisa is on the scaffolding, having climbed it brazenly, in
broad daylight. She holds a small metal box with a meter and
two clamps. She applies the clamps to the base of the cable.
The needle on the meter dances.
GUARD
Hey! Get down here!
She was expecting to be busted. Still, she's scared.
A Catholic school on a wooded lane. Schoolgirls in uniform
play on the swings and hopscotch courts.
The music echoes from inside. Push past a line of cars and
limousines in the lit-up drive, Milo's car at the head of
it.
Milo and Alice get out. As they go inside, she pulls a tag
from the sleeve of his just-bought dinner jacket.
In the car, Milo and Alice pull away from the lights and
limos in icy silence. Several beats.
ALICE
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
MILO
I went to see the Skywire model in
Gary's office. You know. Just to
hold it again.
He looks at her. She stares ahead, out the windshield.
ALICE
Are you having an affair, Milo?
He'd better have his story straight with Gary and Alice.
MILO
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody,
just now. To tell her how I feel
about you.
(looks at her)
You know I'm clueless, without you.
You know I --
ALICE
(fighting tears)
Just shut up?
Or is she faking it? Has he lost the trust of all of them?
He's afraid, now.
Move in on the building, past Kids playing in the yard.
By the balustrade, in the dimness, Milo stands with Lisa.
LISA
Does he know you know?
MILO
He suspects I know something. I think
he was sort of -- explaining himself
to me, in case I do.
(he breathes)
We have to go in tonight. I'm two
hours from a Beta version.
(knows she won't like
it)
But I've gotta go home for an hour.
LISA
Why?!
MILO
She called to apologize. I said I
was pulling an all-nighter. She said
then come home just to say Hi. Which
I always do when we fight, it's
suspicious if I don't.
LISA
Please don't go.
MILO
At this point the worst thing I could
do is anything out of the ordinary.
She looks at him, worried, then takes a disk out of her
backpack.
LISA
Here's the interface.
He takes it. They kiss. She watches him go, worried.
As Milo comes up the path, he sees Alice in the kitchen.
He opens the front door, steps in. She comes from the kitchen
in an apron, wiping her hands. The apron is spattered, her
hair is askew.
ALICE
I'm a mess! I got this Hunan cookbook,
since we're always afraid for you to
eat in Chinese restaurants. I've
been mincing things into teeny-tiny
pieces all afternoon.
He smiles to hide his terror. Is she killing him now? Or
just testing his reaction? Or is it a sincere overture?
MILO
Great!
ALICE
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
When she turns away, we see the fear on his face.
Shrot and Len hurry out of the building, toward the Day Care
across the quad. Len is ill-at-ease:
LEN
Bob, I'm a programmer, not a cop.
In his haste, Shrot doesn't even hear him.
Milo hurries away from the Day Care. He has just one data
tower, now, so he can move faster.
Milo moves low among the high-priced cars, lugging the tower.
He gets to his Deux Chevaux, opens the trunk --
VOICE
Hey!
Milo turns. It's Desi, again.
DESI
Wanna get a cheeseburger or something?
MILO
Maybe another time.
As calmly as possible, he stows the tower, slams the trunk,
gets in the car.
Milo is on the phone, he drives as fast as one can in his
car.
MILO
Meet me at the other location.
LISA (V.O.)
Tell me you're not calling on your
car phone?!
Milo reads the address off the business card, which has a
satellite dish as its logo. (He holds it in front of him.)
When he brings down the card, it reveals a real-life satellite
dish through the windshield.
As the car pulls up by a low cinderblock building, we read a
sign that says KNQR - PUBLIC ACCESS.
Lisa drives fast, checking her rear-view-mirror to make sure
she's not being followed. Pan to the seat next to her: her
laptop lies on the passenger seat.
We see the Earth far below. The Skywire Satellite orbits
majestically into frame, shifts five degrees to the left.
Gunther and Riman squeal into the station parking lot.
A second Skywire satellite shifts regally away from the Earth,
as if shunning the signal.
Gunther and Riman tear through the barricade the Rent-A-Cop
has erected with ruthless precision.
High wide shot: sirens scream as unmarked sedans and squadcars
squeal into the sanctified parking lot.
GARY'S VOICE OVER
Is loyalty and group spirit somehow
"sinister" nowadays?
Gunther & Riman turn off a rural road...
GARY (O.S.)
As for PR, Skywire'll take care of
all that.
...onto a tarmac. A private jet sits lit up, waiting.
