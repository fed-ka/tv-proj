    NICK's on his cell in a ghetto bachelor pad.  Two dead white
    early-20s VICS ("WES AYKIN" and "TONY MALOS") face-down on
  the floor, their wrists and ankles bound with duct tape.

                  Just landed a double in Northtown.

  "Wes Aykin" and "Tony Malos," both white, wiry, tatted up. 
  Lying face-down on the floor.  Wrists and ankles duct-taped. 
  Wes is shirtless.

  Nick sees the half-smoked blunts and malt liquor bottles on
  the coffee table between couch and flat-screen.

                TV or stereo on when officers

                  juvie stuff a few years back, but
                  their ink says they've gone pro.    

  Nick reads the GOTHIC-LETTERED TAT spanning the back of Wes
    Aykin's neck.

  Nick has moved to a table littered with CREDIT CARD

    finished cards.

  Nick looks along the kitchen floor.  Squints at something.

  Nick follows the bits of metal trace to the back door.  Opens
  the door.  The exterior of the door is fitted with a heavy-
  duty STEEL PLATE lock, which has been cleanly SLICED OPEN.

  DR. ROBBINS and DAVID PHILLIPS now present, as Nick enters
  the room.  Robbins is jotting notes, as David Phillips reads
  his liver stick. 

                                  NICK
                  Didn't know you were here. 

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                  Already flipped 'em and sticked
                  'em.  Both died around midnight. 

    NICK'S POV - THE VICTIMS' NECKS 

    Encircled with thin, incised wounds.

                  Nasty neck wounds...  

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  They were garroted.    

    Robbins nods to a 20-inch strand of WIRE lying on the floor,
  the ends of it curled into crude "handles". 

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Found that wire underneath this
                  victim.  

  Nick picks up the wire.

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                  Also noticed some burns --

    STEREO BLASTING as Wes and Tony, buzzed and baked, laugh at
  some dumb shit on TV.

                -- must have known it was a good
                  time to strike.  

  N.D. KILLER appears behind the couch.  As Tony gets up, to
  grab another forty, CAMERA FOLLOWS TONY... to the little
    fridge in the corner of the room... then back to the couch,
  where WES is now UNCONSCIOUS, with his wrists duct-taped.

    Before Tony utters a sound -- ZZZZT!  He's tased from behind
  by N.D. Killer.  Drops to his knees. 

    MOMENTS LATER

  Wes and Tony on the floor, wrists and ankles taped, N.D.
    Killer alternately strangling them with a WIRE GARROTE.

    Paramedic Rill administers chest compressions to his IV'd

  As Paramedic Rill activates the defibrillator, Frank Cafferty
  stirs a little.  Sucking a thin breath.

                  There we go. 

  Then, Frank GROANS something, under his breath.   

    MORGAN'S POV:

    Looking down at Frank's face.  His eyes half-shut, distant. 
  As he breathes out, muffled but audible -- 

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  Samantha. 

  Frank grasps his hand out, and before Morgan can react, he's
    grabbed her hand.  Clutches it.  Mutters, again, desperate --   

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  Samantha... 

    Morgan is uncomfortable.  But lets him keep holding her hand.

  WITH MORGAN

  As she pockets her cell.  

    Suddenly, Frank Cafferty starts SEIZING.  Paramedic Rill
    scrambles to the monitors on one side of him, as the violent
    seizure RIPS DOWN the IV BAG on the other side.  

    Morgan bounds over, to grab the IV BAG, and as she crouches
  by Frank, she feels something, throws a hand to -- 

  HER HOLSTER.  Empty.  MORGAN'S EYES dart up, to -- *

  A GUN BARREL.  Right in her face.  Frank Cafferty looming
    behind it.

  WIDER

    Paramedic Rill sees the gun.  Lurches back, hands up.  Still
    restrained, Frank holds the gun on Morgan.  Screams up to
  the cockpit --

  FADE IN:



    Frank's sitting up, in charge, gun trained on Morgan, his
  eyes working between Morgan, Paramedic Rill and Pilot Harmon. 

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  Everybody's cans off.  Cell phones,
                  too, give 'em to me.  Now.   

  All three take off their headsets.  Dig out their cells, and
  slide them along the floor to Frank.  

  Frank rips the IV from his arm, and opens the copter's "CLAM
    SHELL" HATCH.  WIND RUSHING IN, he tosses the cell phones. 
    Closes the hatch.  To Pilot Harmon --

                  Who's Samantha? 

  Frank tenses. Morgan realizes she may have said the wrong
    thing.  Backtracks, feeling him out.    

                                    MORGAN
                You might've been dreaming.  Kind
                of muttered it when you were under...

                  I wasn't dreaming. 

    MORGAN'S POV:

    STYLIZED CLOSE-UPS as she examines Frank, searching for clues
  about him:

  -- HIS RING FINGER.  Nothing on it. 

  -- THE TATTOOS on his exposed chest.  A BLACK CAT, a RIFLE. 
  One other tattoo, above his heart, is mostly blocked by the
  open edge of his shirt.  What is visible is an inked curve,
  above an inked square-edge.  


41VFX SHOT - THE TWO PIECES OF THE OBSCURED TATTOO 41

  are GHOSTED-OVER with a shape consistent with both -- 

    A LETTER "S."

                She someone special to you? 

  Frank looks at her.  Then --

  He WHIPS AROUND, aiming the gun on Paramedic Rill --  

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  What'd you do?!

    Paramedic Rill's plastered back against his seat.  

                                    PARAMEDIC SAM RILL
                  Nothing, I --

                You moved.  You're trying something. 

                                    PARAMEDIC SAM RILL
                  I didn't move!  You're on medication,
                  your vision's compromised -- 

  As Frank squints one eye, aiming right between Rill's eyes.

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                You wanna test my vision, Doc?  

                                    MORGAN
                  Frank.  Not worth it.   

  But Frank holds his aim.  A long beat.  Paramedic Rill quakes.

                  Drug him, I don't want him moving! 

    Morgan's frozen.

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                You got five seconds. 

    Paramedic Rill nods to a medical case.

                        (to Morgan)
                  Morphine.  Fill a syringe.   

    Morgan picks up the case, pulls out bottle of morphine and a
    syringe.  Hesitates.  With a look from Paramedic Rill -- do
  it -- Morgan fills the syringe, moves to him.  Rill helps
  guide the needle.  Closes his eyes as the drug rushes in... 



    Catherine enters, ending a cell call.  *

    scrawled on it -- www.vidshare.com/1276.  She puts that aside.    *

  Sara pulls a big stack of SNAPSHOTS, FRANK with a DARK-HAIRED*
    LITTLE GIRL.  The girl ranging in age from a toddler to age
  11 (some of the photos have date stamps, between 1993 - 2002).

                  dependent. 

    Catherine digs out a stack of BLACK & WHITE XEROXED pictures*
  of the face of a 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL.  Cropped from a different
  photo and blown up.  Written across the bottom: "Call Frank:

                                    CATHERINE
                  Think he was searching for her.  

    Catherine eyes the copied photo against the photos of the
    little girl.  It's the same girl.  

  Sara pulls an envelope, with a letter inside.  Reads to
    herself for a beat. 

                                  SARA
                  Daughter's name is Samantha.  Sent

                you never have... You asked for a
                  recent photo of me?  Here you go." 

  Sara reacts to the accompanying photo...

                                  SARA
                  Ouch.

  ... shows it to Catherine.  Snapshot of 16-year-old Samantha
    sitting on the lap of a 16-year-old, lip-pierced bad boy. 
  Her skirt is tiny, and his hand's up her thigh.  Taunt is
  clear in Samantha's eyes -- Fuck you, Dad. [NOTE: The Xeroxed
  image of Samantha's face is cropped from this same picture.]

                                    CATHERINE
                  I've seen him before.  *

    Catherine picks up her iPad, starts flipping through PHOTOS

    Something in Russell's tone unnerves Ecklie.

                  Because of the patient's head wound,
                  pilot wanted to avoid altitude, so

    TIFFANY BAMFORD in bed.  Two STITCHED-UP GASHES along her
    forehead and a sick swell around her eye.  Her hair is crudely
  DYED black, some streaks of the dye staining her forehead. 
  She's a little hazy, speech slurred, as she talks to Nick.

                But what if we can?  Find her, and
                let Frank know she's alive.  That

                  How?

  He shakes his head, not going there.  Morgan sees an in. 

                                    MORGAN
                  A month ago I sat down with my Dad
                for the first time in twelve years.  

  Frank looks at her. 

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                He took off when you were a kid?    

                                    MORGAN
                No.  But when I was fourteen and
                  he'd messed up enough that Mom wanted
                to leave for California... he didn't
                  fight for me to stay.  
                        (then)
                If he would've just fought for me. 
                He wouldn't have won, but... 

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  That would've been enough?

  She looks him in the eyes, nods. 

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                You finally forgave him? 

                                    MORGAN
                  I finally decided it was worth
                  trying.  So we're starting over. 

  She points this right at Frank. 

                                    MORGAN
                  Whatever mistakes he made... we can
                get past them.  People change. 
                  He's a better man, now.  We have a
                  second chance.

  Her words settling onto Frank, when -- 

  -- WHAM!  Paramedic Rill JUMPS Frank, wrestling him for the
  gun.  Morgan's as blind-sided as Frank.  But reacts, lunging
  for the gun, a GLINTING BLUR between the battling hands of
  the two men until -- 

  BLAM!  A SHOT's fired. Paramedic Rill staggers back, drops
  to his knees.  The gut of his jumpsuit quickly STAINING with

                  prison, handful of weekends before

                  That's what they said on the news. 
                Why I'm here.  Not for him.  Just
                  don't want him hurting anyone else.
                        (then)

                and wants to talk to you.  Do you
                  copy?  

    Ecklie glances at his watch.  Paces.

                                    ECKLIE
                  He's either not hearing it, or not
                  buying it. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  Could be cruising at low altitude,
                  he'll hear it when they rise over a
                  crest...   

                                    ECKLIE
                    I appreciate the rationalization. 
                  When it comes to Morgan, I've become
                  something of a master at it.

    Reliving the "greatest hits" -- 

                                    ECKLIE
                  She's fourteen, she doesn't
                  understand what her mother and I
                are arguing about.  Sixteen-year-
                  olds are all moody, she doesn't
                  mean it.  She's busy at school. 
                  She's busy at work.  She'll call. 
                  She'll call.  And then -- 

    Ecklie's still a little astonished by the fact --  

                                    ECKLIE
                  She's here.  
                        (a beat)
                  Chip the size of the Stratosphere
                on her shoulder, still vowing eternal
                  vengeance against me, but --

                                    RUSSELL
                  A second chance. 

                                    ECKLIE
                It cannot end this way. 



  Sara, file in hand, catches up to Catherine. *

                                  SARA*
                Hey Catherine?*

  Sara shows her a printed copy of the Porsche Cayenne photo. *

                                  SARA
                The Porsche Cayenne from Cafferty's
                    surveillance photos.  DMV had only*
                  three Cayennes matching that partial*
                  plate, one registered in the Mad-
                  10s' hood, to an Alexander Zadian -- *

  She produces a DMV RECORD and RAP SHEET for Alexander Zadian. 
  PHOTO of him shows a mean-looking 35-year-old Caucasian.  

                                  SARA
                  Priors for assault, possession with
                  intent, extortion -- but he's on
                the street now. 

                                    CATHERINE
                And our best suspect for the
                  attempted murder of Frank Cafferty. 

                                  SARA
                  Uniforms have been looking for
                  Zadian.  Let you know if their luck
                  changes. 



  ANGLE ON THE FUEL GAUGE, needle flirting with EMPTY.  

                                  PILOT KIRK HARMON (O.S.)*
                  Your call, Ace.    

    Frank, gun in hand, is looking over Pilot Harmon's shoulder
  at the gauge.  Pilot Harmon's bitterness has taken over. 

                                  PILOT KIRK HARMON*
                  We're ten out from Parham Airstrip. 
                We touch down and refuel, or this
                  party's not going much longer.

  Frank mulls that.  Behind him, in the cabin, Paramedic Rill
    MOANS.  Frank spins, to see Morgan tending to Rill, who's
    sitting on the floor, bloody gauze wrapped around his belly. 

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  Give him something to shut him up. 

                                    PARAMEDIC SAM RILL
                Go to hell. 

                                    MORGAN
                We need to get him to a hospital. 
                  Come on, Frank.  I'll stay with
                  you, just let us land, get him help -- 

  Frank wrestles with his next move.  Cramped space closing in
  on him.  Paramedic Rill GROANS again.  

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  Shut up!

  He yanks the headset on, just to mute everything else out.  

  ... And then, hearing the radio, his expression changes.  He
    clutches the headset tighter to his ear with one hand. 
    Listening.  



  CLOSE ON THE POLICE RADIO as it crackles to life.  

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY (V.O.)
                  This is Frank Cafferty. 

  WIDER TO REVEAL

    Russell, lunging for the radio.  Ecklie stops pacing.  

                                    RUSSELL
                  Frank?  This is D.B. Russell with
                the L.V.P.D.  I have someone who
                  wants to talk to you.

  Just then, Officer Shelley, carrying her own police radio,*
    appears in the doorway.  Samantha at her side.  Russell waves*
    Samantha in.  *

    Holding down the talk button, Russell puts the radio in front
  of Samantha. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  Here. 

                                    SAMANTHA CAFFERTY
                  Dad? 

                                                                      INTERCUT WITH:  CSI: "CSI Down" - 1205 - WHITE - 8/31/1138.



  To Frank, the voice is nothing short of a miracle.  

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  Samantha?  Sammy, I thought you
                  were dead.  I saw you -- 

                                    SAMANTHA CAFFERTY
                The police told me.  That wasn't
                me, Dad.  I'm fine. 
                        (then)
                And they told me... you were trying
                to rescue me.

  ON ECKLIE, affected by this remarkable reunion.  Waiting to
  hear Morgan's voice.  Hoping she's okay.

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  I was, Sammy. 

  ON MORGAN, hearing only Frank's end of the conversation, but
  it's powerful stuff. 

                                    SAMANTHA CAFFERTY
                You remember, when I was little,*
                  that wishing well you told me was*
                  mine?*

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  Course I do, Sammy. 

                                    SAMANTHA CAFFERTY
                Go there.  I've sent someone to
                  help you get away.  I love you,
                  Dad.  

  As Ecklie, blind-sided, yanks the radio from her.  

                                    ECKLIE
                  Frank?  Frank, listen to me, are
                you there?   

  No response.  

                                    ECKLIE
                  Frank.  

    Silence.  He WHIPS the radio against the floor.  Samantha's*
  in tears.  

                                    SAMANTHA CAFFERTY
                I'm sorry.  

    Ecklie stalks out of the room.

  ON RUSSELL, eyes going from Ecklie to Samantha, studying
  her.  Bothered by something.  He waves in Officer Shelley
  from the hallway.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Cuff her.  She doesn't move.  



  Frank pops the headphones off.  

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                Go North. 

                                  PILOT KIRK HARMON*
                  Come on.  No way we make it to the
                  next airstrip.   

  Gun to Pilot Harmon's head. 

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                Got no problem flying solo.  

                                    MORGAN
                        (to Frank)
                  Don't you want to see her?

  Frank says nothing.  Pilot Harmon shakes his head, resigned. 
  Yanks the controls into a TURN.  A poison look back to Morgan --

                                  PILOT KIRK HARMON*
                  Maybe next life, you keep a better
                  grip on your pistol.

    Russell strategizes with Nick, Sara and Greg.  There's a
  dark weight on Russell's shoulders, but he presses forward.  

                                    RUSSELL
                        (to Nick and Sara)

                  Samantha sent out to meet Frank. *

                                  SARA
                We check her recents, find the
                  getaway driver she contacted, might
                be able to intercept or follow.  

                                  NICK

  Nick and Sara exit.  Then --  

                                  GREG
                Why not let Frank get away?

    Russell is quiet.  

                                  GREG
                  Isn't it safer for Morgan, the
                  others, if we just let him land? 
                Let him run.

                                    RUSSELL
                No.

    Pissing Greg off.

                                  GREG
                Why the hell not?       

    Russell looks hard at him.        

                                    RUSSELL
                  Because I'm not so sure Samantha's
                  helping him get away.  

  Greg doesn't understand. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  Girl resents her father for leaving
                  her, what's more likely -- she wants
                to help him?  Or hurt him? 

  And Russell exits, leaving Greg to decode that.

                        (re: photos)
                  Frank and Samantha didn't spend
                  much time together.  If the wishing*
                  well is a shared memory, it might*
                be in one of these boxes... *

    Russell joins her, digging through the photos.  

  BEGIN MONTAGE:  

  -- TIGHT ANGLES on the PHOTOs, flipping by.  Blurred by motion
  and varied focus.   



  -- Ecklie, alone.  Pulls a PHOTO from his pocket.  He and 12-
    year-old Morgan spending time together.  As he absorbs the
    image...  



  -- TIGHT ON more PHOTOS of Frank and Samantha, flipping by. 



  -- Frank at the window.  Searching the ground below.  Morgan
    watches him, reading his desperation.   



  -- CLOSE ON A PHOTO, through Catherine's POV.  FOCUSING on
  an object in the DEEP BACKGROUND of the PHOTO -- an old stone*
    WISHING WELL.   *

                                    CATHERINE (O.S.)
                  I've got it. 

    MONTAGE ENDS.

    REVEAL, Catherine's holding the photo, and shows it to Russell --
    a shot of Frank and nine-year-old Samantha sitting at a picnic*
    table.  Catherine points at the wishing well. *

                                    RUSSELL
                  Park of some sort?  Where?  *

                                    CATHERINE
                  I don't know. 

                                    RUSSELL
                          (recognizes)
                  Their clothing.  There were other
                  photos from that day.  

  He dashes through the other photos.  Plucks one out.  Nails
  it onto the table.  

  CLOSE ON: THE PHOTO

  Frank and Samantha both wearing the same outfits as the other
  pic.  Only, in this one, there's a sign in the background,*
  "Fort Brime Wild West Village."*

                                    RUSSELL
                  Fort Brime Wild West Village...   *

                                    CATHERINE*
                Old theme park, shut down years*
                  ago.



    THROUGH THE WINDOW, looking down on the landscape of the
    ABANDONED WILD WEST VILLAGE.  A strip of dilapidated "Old*
  West" buildings. *

  PULL BACK TO FIND Frank, eyes scanning the landscape. 

                                  PILOT KIRK HARMON*
                On fumes man, what are we looking
                  for? 

  Frank shoves his gun into the back of Pilot Harmon's neck. 
  Keeps his eyes working the scene below. 

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  Keep going.  

  ON FRANK 

  as he reacts to something coming into sight... 

    FRANK'S POV: TWO BLACK SUVs (Zadian's Cayenne is one) appear
  in the distance.  Tearing across the desert, toward the
    helicopter.  Still a long ways off, but -- 

  Frank spins around, aims the gun at Morgan.

81CONTINUED:81

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  Cops?  

    Morgan's confused, grabs the binoculars.

    MORGAN'S BINOCULAR POV: Honing in on the SUVs, as they
    continue ever closer.  

    Morgan looks at Frank, baffled.  

                                    MORGAN 
                Not cops...

    Again, lifting the binoculars.

    MORGAN'S BINOCULAR POV: FOCUSING IN on one SUV, as its
    PASSENGER-SIDE WINDOW ROLLS DOWN... and an AK-47 BARREL pokes
  out, glinting in the SUN. 

                                    MORGAN
                Get us out of here.  

                                  PILOT KIRK HARMON*
                  What?

                                    MORGAN
                  Now!

  A BULLET SPIDERS THE WINDOW.  

  Frank and Morgan duck for cover.  Pilot Harmon tries to duck
  and torque the copter around.  It works, for a moment -- the
    copter JOLTING UP, LEANING into a hard turn, gaining elevation --  

  -- Until the SOUND OF THE PROPELLER CEASES.  Nobody breathes.  

                                  PILOT KIRK HARMON*
                  That's all she's got. 

    Copter HANGS for an instant.  Then STARTS TO PLUNGE, EARTHWARD -- 

                                                                    SMASH TO BLACK.

                                END OF ACT THREE  CSI: "CSI Down" - 1205 - WHITE - 8/31/1146.

                                    ACT FOUR

  FADE IN:



  Brass driving.  On his radio.

                                  BRASS
                  CSIs, I want you keeping your*
                  distance.  You hear that, Sanders.*



    Nick's driving, Greg's shotgun.  Nick picks up the radio.     *

                                  NICK*
                He copies that.*

  He looks to Greg: Eyes ahead, intense.  Nick GUNS the ENGINE. *



    Morgan and Frank work their way through the dark, junk-crowded
  space (stored picnic tables, signs, etc.). In hushed tones,*
  as they move --     

                                    MORGAN
                  They friends of yours? 

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY
                  Probably the same ones who left me
                for dead last night.  Bet you're
                  wishing they'd finished me off. 

  His eyes meet Morgan's.  She doesn't answer that.    

                                    MORGAN
                Bet you're wishing you were in Cabo.*
                          (then)*
                Who told them we'd be here?*

  The realization nails Frank.  *

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY*
                          (mutters)*
                  Samantha.*

  He stumbles.  Coughs up blood.  

                                    MORGAN*
                  Come on. *

  She takes his arm, supporting him.  They keep moving, Frank*
    struggling to keep up. *

    Morgan and Frank hit the deck.  Listening to the GUNFIRE. 
      Indistinguishable SHOUTS outside.  

  Then, silence.  Eerie.  Until... 

    There's a SCRAPE of SOMETHING METAL, jostled.  ECHOING through
  the Saloon.  Someone's inside.  Hear FOOTSTEPS.  Approaching.  *

    Frank, nothing left in him, hands the gun to Morgan. *

                                  FRANK CAFFERTY*
                  It's yours. *

  As he slouches against the wall.  Giving up.  His breathing*
  going shallow.  But Morgan's got bigger concerns --   *

    HEARING more FOOTSTEPS.  She braces, gun ready.  Then -- *

                                  BRASS (O.S.)*
                  Morgan?  It's Brass.  *

    Relief courses through Morgan.  She stands, leans to look*
    around the barrier of junk... *

                                    MORGAN*
                  Over here.*

    MORGAN'S POV: Looking out into the dark Saloon... no Brass...*
  and suddenly --*

  THE MAD-10 LIEUTENANT *

    bursts out from behind a mound of junk, RIFLE aimed at her -- *

  BLAM!  BLAM!  Morgan plants two rounds in his chest.  *


                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "CSI Down" - 1205 - WHITE - 8/31/1150.

93CONTINUED:93

  In an instant, Brass and TWO UNIFORMS rush into view. *

    Discovering the dead Mad-10... and Morgan.  As she holsters
  her weapon, and walks toward Brass. 

                                    MORGAN*
                  Clear outside? 

  But she's already pushing past him. 

                                  BRASS
                ... Yep.

    Before Russell can say anything to her --   

                                    MORGAN
                Can we go? 

                                    RUSSELL
                  You're going to be okay.  

                                    MORGAN
                I'm fine. 

  But Russell knows better.  Touches a hand to Morgan's back...
  and Morgan's wall crumbles.  The whole terrifying day crashing
    through her in tears and trembling.  Russell holds her. 
  Looks up, to -- 

  THE PARTIALLY OPEN PASSENGER-SIDE WINDOW

    Ecklie standing there.  Gutted.      

    Russell means it for both father and daughter --  

                                    RUSSELL
                  Going to be okay.
