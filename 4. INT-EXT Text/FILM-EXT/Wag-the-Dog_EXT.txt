BREAN
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
MOSS
Yes, but I, well, you know...
BREAN
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
MOSS

BREAN
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't
be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
MOSS
Well, yes, but the guy did bring Peace.
BREAN
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
