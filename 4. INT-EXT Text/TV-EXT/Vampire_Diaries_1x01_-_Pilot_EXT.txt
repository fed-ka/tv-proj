    Long.  Winding.  Lined with thick forest.  A lone set of 
    HEADLIGHTS appears down the road.  An SUV comes into view.


    Darren races across the road, where the MAN lies.  Still.

                                DARREN
                  Oh god...

    Slowly, he approaches the man.  Kneels down...

    BESIDE THE BODY.  It s not moving.  Darren knows this isn t 
    good.  He finds his hand -- lifts it.  Feels for a pulse.  

                                DARREN (CONT D)
                  Please be alive.

  We glimpse a ring on the DEAD MAN S FINGER.   It s unusual.  
    ANTIQUE.  A LAPIS STONE.  

  He peers down to the MAN S FACE.  Unable to see him at all.   
    It s pitch black. 

  He flips his cell phone around and hits the touch pad, it 
    lights up his LCD screen.  Uses it as a LIGHT when...

  IN A FLASH -- HANDS REACH OUT.  

  IN A FLASH -- THE MAN RISES UP  

  IN A FLASH -- Darren s head YANKS BACK, neck exposed. 

  IN A FLASH -- SHARP.  GLEAMING.  FANGS.   

  Rip into Darren s throat.  He s dead in an instant.  No 
    scream.  NO NOISE AT ALL.  A vicious, silent death.


    Brooke gets out of the car with her cell, having no idea 
    what s happened just yards away.  She s having trouble 
    getting reception as well.  She walks around to the front of 
  the car.  Calls out.

                                BROOKE
                  Mine doesn t work either.

  Her eyes search the darkness.  There s no Darren.  No man 
    either for that matter.  Brooke looks around.                                                                                  4.



                                BROOKE (CONT D)
                  Darren?

  She turns back to the car.  Frightened.  Terrified.  A NOISE 
    behind her.  She turns.  Just as...

    DARREN S BODY FALLS ONTO THE CAR S HOOD.  From above.  Out of 
    nowhere.  It lands with a resounding THUD.   Sprawled across 
  the hood -- his neck a raw and bloody mess.

    Brooke is paralyzed in horror.   A FIGURE emerges behind her.  
    A MAN silhouetted in the headlights.  His face shadowed.

  She senses his presence.  She spins around.  No one s there.  
    Because, now he s on the other side of her.  How did he get 
    there?  Impossible.  

  She spins around again.  He s gone again.

    Brooke turns and begins to run.  Down the center of the road.  
    SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY.  Trying to put distance between her 
  and whoever is out there...

  She keeps running and running...directly into the fog.  

    Everything becomes blurry real fast.  Brooke keeps moving, 
  not looking back, disappearing further into the hazy mist.

    A POV TRACKING SHOT BEHIND HER...TRAVELING LIGHTNING FAST.  
  IT CATCHES UP WITH HER.

    Suddenly, Brooke s feet leave the ground as her entire body 
    takes flight.   Her SCREAM echoes through the night as 
    something much faster and stronger YANKS HER ENTIRE BODY OUT 
  OF SIGHT.  Then, her SCREAM is cut short.  A deadly silence.  

    SWIRLING FOG FILLS THE FRAME...

    From it, appear the following words...


                          THE VAMPIRE DIARIES

    FADE UP:


    Morning.  Birds chirp.  Sun shines down on a big family home.  
    A veranda wraps around the front.  All charm.  No sense of 
    last night s horror.

                                ELENA (V.O.)
                  Dear Diary...today will be hell.                                                                                  5.




    A small Virginia town.  Quaint, picturesque.  A place you d 
    like to raise a family. Southern in its hospitality, northern 
  in its attitude.

    A Prius makes its way past Main Street.  Mom and Pop.  A 
    couple restaurants.  A hardware store.  A church.

    Elena rides beside BONNIE (17). Light, bubbly, and adorable.  
    A loyal friend with a big heart.  She s in chatty Cathy mode.

                                BONNIE
                  So Grams tells me how I m psychic 
                  because we re descendants of the 
                  Celtic Druids; I know, right?  I 
                  wasn t buying it either until I 
                  remembered my uncanny accuracy.  I 
                  predicted Obama, I predicted David 
                  Cook, Heath Ledger, Britney s 
                  comeback and I still think Florida 
                  will break off and become little 
                  resort islands.  I think there s 
                  something to it.

  She glances over at Elena who is staring out the window, not 
    listening.  She s in another world.  

                                BONNIE (CONT D)
                  Did I tell you about the orgy?  I 
                  had the football team over.  Threw 
                  a blindfold on.  I still don t know 
                  who took my virginity -- ELENA!  
                  BACK IN THE CAR!!!

    Elena JUMPS when she hears Bonnie YELL her name.  She quickly 
    snaps out of her daze. 

                                ELENA
                  I did it again, didn t I?  I m 
                  sorry, Bonnie.  You were saying... 

                                BONNIE
                  What?  C mon, you can do it...

                                ELENA
                        (thinking hard)
                  Something about being psychic.  

    Bonnie TOOTS the horn.  They both LAUGH.                                                                                    8.



                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Okay, then, predict, what s in 
                  store for me?  Give it up.

    Bonnie is turning a corner.  She holds one hand out, waving 
  it like a magic wand.  In complete goof mode.

                                BONNIE
                  I see puppies and daffodils and a 
                  naked Ryan Gosling...

    SUDDENLY, SOMETHING FLIES INTO THE WINDSHIELD.  Bonnie JERKS 
  the steering wheel.  The car goes SKIDDING.  

  She SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.

                                BONNIE (CONT D)
                  What was that?  Oh god...

    Bonnie turns to Elena.  

                                BONNIE (CONT D)
                  Elena?  Are you okay?  I m so 
                  sorry. 

    Elena sits frozen in the front seat. 

                                ELENA
                  I m okay.  It happens.  

                                BONNIE
                  No, I m so sorry, it was like a 
                  bird or something.  It came out of 
                  nowhere.

                                ELENA
                  It s okay.  I can t let cars freak 
                  me out for the rest of my life.  

  She shakes it off.  Determined not to let it cloud her day.  
    Bonnie gets it.  Appreciates it.

                                BONNIE
                  I predict this year is gonna be 
                  kick ass.  And I predict all the 
                  sad and dark times are over.  And 
                  you re going to be happier than 
                  happy.  With some hot sex too.

    Elena smiles.  Touched by all Bonnie says.                                                                                    9.



                                ELENA
                  That s all good.  Just one thing. 
                  If you re psychic, how come you 
                  didn t predict the bird?

    Bonnie grins.  HITS the gas and they re off.


    Bonnie s Prius takes off down the road.  The CAMERA PANS to a 
    telephone pole.  Where an ominous BLACK CROW sits, perched at 
  the top.  Deadly still.


    A small town high school.  Nothing special.  Just real. 

    A GUY enters frame, moving across the parking lot.  We don t 
  see his face.  He passes through other arriving STUDENTS.  
    Slowly a few people start to turn, noticing this new arrival.


    Bonnie and Elena move down the hall when... 

    CAROLINE TRUITT (17) approaches.  Extremely pretty in a 
    manufactured way.  Hair, make-up, wardrobe, she s done to 
    death.  Bit of a queen bee persona. 

  She sees Elena and immediately goes to her, embracing her, 
    holding her tight.

                                CAROLINE
                  Hi girls.  Elena, my god, how are 
                  you?  It s so good to see you.  

                                ELENA
                      (as rehearsed)
                  Thanks, Caroline, I m fine. 

    Caroline is genuine.  In her own way, she truly cares.  Elena 
    busies herself with her locker.

                                CAROLINE
                  Have you seen Matt yet?  

    Elena shakes her head.  

                                BONNIE
                  They broke up, Caroline.                                                                                  10.



                                CAROLINE
                  I know that.  But they can still 
                  talk.

                                ELENA
                  He was at his Dad s all summer.

                                CAROLINE
                  So what s the status?  Friends, 
                  cordial, awkward at best?

    Elena shrugs just as MATT (17) comes waltzing around the 
    corner.  Everybody s All-American.  Handsome jock.   Even-
    tempered, gentle eyes.

  He sees the three girls.  

                                MATT
                  Hey, guys...

  His eyes go straight to Elena.  She smiles.  Friendly. 

                                ELENA
                  Hi, Matt.

  He gives her an awkward nod and takes off.

                                MATT
                  Good to see you.  Later.

    Caroline watches him go.

                                CAROLINE
                  In case you missed it, you two are 
                  awkward at best. 

  She heads off.  Bonnie gives Elena a supportive smile.  Hang 
  in there, girl.  Then, she takes off with Caroline.  Elena 
    turns back to her locker -- doing exactly that.


  The empty football field.  Empty bleachers.

                                JEREMY (V.O.)
                  Don t take more than 2 in a 6 hour 
                  window.                                                                                  11.




    Behind the bleachers of the football field, near the storage 
    garage, hidden by dumpsters is -- THE PIT.  As in a stoner s 
  pit stop.  Where you come to partake in all things illegal.  
    Every small town school has one.  Jeremy hangs with some 
    STONERS.

    VICKI (18) stares at two pills in her hand.   Sexy hot.  A 
    little on the trashy side.  She s very desirable  And she 
    knows it.  Depends on it -- in that sad way.

  She takes two and pops them in her mouth and swallows.  

                                VICKI
                  What are they?

                                JEREMY
                  You might wanna reverse the order 
                  next time, ask first, swallow 
                  second; Alprazolam, a mellow and 
                  breezy descendant of the 
                    benzodiazepine family. 

                                VICKI
                  What happens if I take more than 
                  two?

                                JEREMY
                  You ll shave your head and lip sync 
                  for the rest of your life.

    Someone passes Jeremy a lit joint.  He takes a toke.  Turns 
    back to Vicki just as...

    TYLER STRATTON (18) saunters up.  Athletic, attractive, 
    arrogant.  He goes straight for Vicki.

                                TYLER
                  I knew I d find you here, holding 
                  court.

                                VICKI
                        (flip)
                  With my fellow crack heads. 

    Tyler notices Jeremy -- sees the joint, takes it from him.

                                TYLER
                  Hey, Pete Wentz called.  He wants 
                  his eyeliner back.

    Jeremy doesn t miss a beat.                                                                                  12.



                                JEREMY
                  Pete Wentz, huh?  How old school 
                  TRL of you.  Carson Daly fan?

    Tyler starts to lunge.  Vicki pulls him back.

                                VICKI
                  Be nice.  That s Elena s little 
                  brother.

                                TYLER
                  I know who he is, I ll still kick 
                  his ass.  

  He does a fake-out lunge.  It makes Jeremy jump.  Tyler 
    LAUGHS.  So does Vicki.  That burns.  

    Tyler takes a big toke of the joint.  Then, leans over and 
    kisses Vicki -- shotguns his toke.  It s sexy.  

  And it drives Jeremy mad.  Deflated, Jeremy turns back to the 
    STONERS, takes another hit.  Bummin  hard.  


    Elena, Caroline and Bonnie approach the football field.  They 
    carry practice POM POMS.

                                CAROLINE
                  His name is Stefan Whitmore.  He 
                  lives with his great-uncle in the 
                  old Whitmore Boarding House.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  17.

                                CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  He hasn t lived here since he was a 
                  kid.  Military family.  They 
                  traveled a lot.  He s a Gemini and 
                  has a scratched retina and that s 
                  why he wears the shades inside.

                                BONNIE
                  You got all that in one day?

                                CAROLINE
                  I got all that in between bells 
                  after third period.  So, bagsies.  
                  He s all mine.  I saw him first.

                                BONNIE
                  I say we both throw ourselves at 
                  him and whoever he picks gets him.  

                                CAROLINE
                  That s the same as saying he s 
                  mine.

                                BONNIE
                  Ouch.  Bitch.

    Elena looks to the field.  Sees the CHEERLEADERS warming up.  
  The FOOTBALL TEAM running drills.  Beat.  

                                ELENA
                  You know what, guys?  I m gonna 
                  skip out.

                                CAROLINE
                  What do you mean?  It s Freshman 
                  tryouts.

                                BONNIE
                  It s better than IDOL.

                                ELENA
                  You guys enjoy.  I ll catch up with 
                  you later.

    Elena throws them a smile and takes off.  

                                CAROLINE
                  You can t just...

                                BONNIE
                  Let it go.

    Bonnie motions to Caroline.  Don t make a big deal.                                                                                  18.




    A sprawling, ornate cemetery filled with enormous mausoleums, 
  and rows and rows of well-tended tombstones.  This town is 
    rich in history, and its dead are revered.

                                ELENA (V.O.)
                  Dear Diary.  I made it.  I got 
                  through the day in one piece.  

    Find Elena leaning up against a tombstone, writing.

                                ELENA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  Okay, so I wasn t feeling the pom 
                  pom s.  But I think that could be a 
                  good thing...

    A closer look reveals that the pair of tombstones are labeled 
    GRAYSON GILBERT and MIRANDA SOMERS GILBERT.  LOVING PARENTS.

    ANGLE THROUGH A NEARBY CRYPT

    Someone is watching Elena.  Lurking.  She looks up, 
    noticing...

    There s a CROW perched on her mother s tombstone.  Large, 
    black, still.  It stares at her, like it knows her.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Okay...hi, bird.

  It doesn t move.  Just watches her.  Unblinking.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Not creepy or anything.  Big black 
                  crow in a cemetery.

    A slow, thick FOG creeps in, settling in around Elena.  She 
    notices it.  Weird.  She stands up.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  And cue the fog.  Jesus.

  The crow still stares.  Annoyed, she waves one hand at it.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Shoo...or whatever.

  It doesn t move.  She looks at it.  Then makes a sudden LUNGE 
  for it.  Startled, the crow flies away.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  That s what I thought.                                                                                  19.



  She turns around and GASPS --- THE CROW IS ON THE TOMBSTONE 
    BEHIND HER.  Its eyes burning into her.  Her head whips in 
  the direction she saw it fly and then back to the tombstone.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  How did ---

    Freaked out, she bends over to pick up her bag, but the crow 
    suddenly takes flight again, fluttering its enormous wings.  
    Elena holds back a scream.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Screw you.

  She briskly walks away.  The fog is getting thicker... 
    murkier.  And there s the crow again, perched in a low tree.

  She picks up her pace, almost running.  The fog swirling 
    around her.  She loses her bearings, trips over a vine...

  She goes to the ground.  Shit.  She rights herself, wincing.  
    Have scruffed her leg.  She looks back and sees...

  THE FIGURE OF A MAN through the fog.  What the...?

    That s it.  Elena hauls ass.  She takes off in the opposite 
    direction, running, racing through the cemetery when she...

    RUNS SMACK INTO STEFAN.  Elena SCREAMS. 

                                STEFAN
                  Are you okay?

    Elena scrambles back, freaked.

                                ELENA
                  Were you following me?

    Confused, she looks behind her.  Where the FIGURE was.  

                                STEFAN
                  No.  I mean, yes, sort of.  I saw 
                  you fall.

                                ELENA
                        (suspicious)
                  You like to lurk in graveyards?

                                STEFAN
                  I was visiting...I have family 
                  here.

  She sags.  Embarrassed.  Suddenly nervous in his presence.                                                                                  20.



                                ELENA
                  Oh wow.  Tactless, I m sorry.  I m 
                  not thinking clearly, it s the fog, 
                  made me foggy and there was this 
                  bird and it was all very Hitchcock 
                  there for a second -- it was 
                  Hitchcock, right, the bird movie?
                        (beat, stopping herself)
                  I m Elena.

    Stefan smiles at her nervousness.

                                STEFAN
                  I m Stefan.

                                ELENA
                  I know.

  He reaches over and brushes her hair to the side.  Pulls a 
    small leaf from it.  Elena almost trembles.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Thank you...

    There s something electric in this moment.  As he pulls his 
    hand away, Elena notices a RING ON HIS HAND.  An antique.  
    With a lapis stone at its center.  We ve seen it before.  

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                        (dry)
                  Nice ring.

                                STEFAN
                  Family ring.  I know it s weird.

                                ELENA
                  It s just, there are rings and then 
                  there are RINGS.

    Stefan stops suddenly, head tilting.  As if smelling the air.

                                STEFAN
                  Did you hurt yourself?  

    Elena looks down and sees her pants are torn.  She leans down 
  and lifts her pant s leg to reveal...

    BLOOD COMING FROM A SMALL CUT.  Stefan s eyes FIXATE on it.

                                ELENA
                  Oh, yeah, look at that.                                                                                  21.



  She inspects it.  Blood drips down her ankle.  Stefan can t 
    tear his eyes away.  His breath gets ragged. 

                                STEFAN
                  Get away.

                                ELENA
                        (looking up)
                  What ---

  He spins away from her, hiding his face.  Elena doesn t see, 
  but we glimpse something -- a vein pulsating?  Something in 
  his eyes?  It s so fast, we re not quite sure.

                                STEFAN
                        (fierce)
                  I SAID GO.

    Stunned and confused, Elena retreats a few steps.  But then 
    stops and looks back.  Stefan is gone. 


                                END OF ACT ONE                                                                                  22.


                                      ACT TWO


      A turn-of-century home set deep in the woods.  A gorgeous 
    arched window on the upper floor...A MALE VOICE.  Stefan.

                                STEFAN (V.O.)
                  I lost control today.


    ...falling the fifty feet to the ground.  He lands 
    effortlessly.  And heads off into the woods.                                                                                  23.




    ...Stefan standing on her porch.

                                ELENA
                        (startled)
                  Oh.                                                                                  26.



                                STEFAN
                  Hi.  Sorry.  I was about to knock.
                        (beat)
                  I wanted to apologize for earlier.  
                  I know it was strange.

                                ELENA
                  That s an understatement.  How did 
                  you know where I lived?

                                STEFAN
                  It s a small town.
                        (then)
                  I thought you might like this back.

  He hands over her journal.

                                STEFAN (CONT D)
                  You must have dropped it in the 
                  cemetery.

                                ELENA
                  Thank you.

    She s wary, but intrigued.

                                STEFAN
                  I didn t read it.

                                ELENA
                  You have more restraint than most 
                  people.

                                STEFAN
                  I wouldn t want anyone to read 
                  mine.

                                ELENA
                  You keep a journal?

                                STEFAN
                        (simply)
                  Memories are important.

    Elena knows this.

                                ELENA
                  Yeah.
                        (re: the journal)
                  I ll just...                                                                                  27.



  She heads inside to put the book away in her school bag.  
    Stefan lingers at the door.  Eyeing the threshold.  Unable to 
    enter.  Elena calls back to him.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  You don t have to stand out there.

  Not exactly an invitation.

                                STEFAN
                  I m fine.

  She returns to the front door.  He notices her purse.

                                STEFAN (CONT D)
                  I m sorry, were you going 
                  somewhere?

                                ELENA
                  I m meeting my friend.

  She stares at him.  Considering. 

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Do you want to come?

  He smiles at her.  A smile you could get lost in.


    Through the front window, we see a group of teens crammed 
    around a table together.


    Lunchtime.  STUDENTS mingle, eat, chatter.  Matt and Tyler 
    throw a FOOTBALL around with some other PLAYERS.

    Elena and Bonnie sit together, snacking on chips.  Bonnie 
    points across the quad.  To where Caroline walks with Stefan, 
    chatting him up.

                                ELENA
                  She s relentless.                                                                                  36.



                                BONNIE
                  Like a pit bull.  She s inviting 
                  him to the pop up party.

                                ELENA
                  There s a pop up party? 

                                BONNIE
                  Tonight.  Caroline decided.  She 
                  wants to be the first one this 
                  year.

                                ELENA
                  Why didn t she tell me?

                                BONNIE
                  It just popped up.  And she s 
                  pissed at you.

                                ELENA
                  Because of Stefan?

                                BONNIE
                  Because you breathe, Elena.  
                  Because the teacher chose you to 
                  erase the chalk board in the first 
                  grade.  Because it s who she is.

    They continue to watch as...

    ACROSS THE QUAD

    Matt hurls the football.  He gets tackled right as he lets 
  go.  The ball sails off course.

    Elena sees that the ball is heading right for Stefan and 
    Caroline.  She opens her mouth to shout a heads up...

    ...but at the last second Stefan turns, catching the ball 
    with ease.  As if he heard it coming.

    Elena and Bonnie exchange a look.  That was hot.

  ON STEFAN AND CAROLINE

  As Matt jogs up to them.  Begrudgingly impressed.

                                MATT
                  Nice catch.

                                STEFAN
                        (handing the ball back)
                  Thanks.                                                                                  37.



    Matt heads back to his buddies.

  ON ELENA AND BONNIE

                                BONNIE
                  So, party.  You in?  I mean, I 
                  understand if you re not feeling 
                  it.

                                ELENA
                  I m in.

    Elena doesn t tear her eyes away from Stefan.  Bonnie 
    registers this. 

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


    A stunning waterfall, lit up by the rich moonlight.  We see 
  how the town got its name.

    Through the trees, a wide clearing.  A BONFIRE roars in the 
    center.  TEENS enjoy their impromptu party.

    Stefan arrives.  He scans the sea of people.  It s crowded.  
  He tilts his head, listening.

    PUSH IN ON HIS EAR as it filters through the sounds of the 
    party.  The ROARING BONFIRE...a couple GIRLS rolling a joint.  
    A GUY picking up on a GIRL...

    A CACOPHONY of CHATTER.  And then, the voice he s listening 
    for.

    CAMERA PUSHES AT HIGH SPEED THROUGH THE PARTY, arriving at 
    Elena.  She s talking to Bonnie.

                                BONNIE
                  It was more like a vibe.

                                ELENA
                  What kind of vibe?

                                BONNIE
                  Like a dangerous vibe.  I debated 
                  even telling you.  

                                ELENA
                  Aren t you taking this psychic 
                  thing a little too far?                                                                                  38.



                                BONNIE
                  All right, maybe I m not psychic, 
                  but I do have good intuition.  And 
                  when I touched Stefan, I felt 
                  something.  

    BACK WITH STEFAN.  He s overheard their conversation.  Not 
    sure what to think of it.  

  He starts moving in their direction, but Caroline waylays 
    him.  She has a drink in her hand.  Clearly not her first.

                                CAROLINE
                  You made it.

                                STEFAN
                  I did.

                                CAROLINE
                  Let s get you a drink.

    He s too polite to say no.  They head off.  Across the way, 
    Elena still talks with Bonnie.  Unaware that he has arrived.


  The party is raging.  And Jeremy is right in the center of 
  it, helping himself to a drink at the keg.  He sees Vicki and 
    makes a beeline for her.

                                VICKI
                        (dismissive)
                  Is that for me?

  She takes the drink from his hand.  He lets her.                                                                                    39.



                                JEREMY
                  What s got you so screwed up?  I 
                  know my problem, but what s yours?  
                  Mom?  Dad?  That golden retriever 
                  brother of yours? 

  She LAUGHS.  Takes another drink.

                                VICKI
                  Don t read into me.  Sometimes a 
                  crack whore is just a crack whore.

                                JEREMY
                  Why do you talk that way about 
                  yourself?

                                VICKI
                  It s a joke.

                                JEREMY
                  Lacking in humor and self esteem.  
                  And, for the record, sex is not 
                  your calling card.  Not with me.  
                  We had fun this summer and you know 
                  it and it sucks that you can t 
                  admit it.  

    BAM!  Suddenly, Jeremy is RAMMED FROM BEHIND.  By Tyler.  It 
    knocks the wind out of Jeremy.  Who almost keels over.  

    Tyler is there to LAUGH HIMSELF SILLY.

                                TYLER
                  Now why is it I always see you 
                  hovering around this beauty?
                      (to Vicki)
                  Does he think he has a chance?

    Vicki locks eyes with Jeremy.  There s a connection there.  
    However brief.  Then, Vicki LAUGHS.

                                VICKI
                  Yeah, right...

    Together, Tyler and Vicki saunter off as Jeremy watches.  

  ON ELENA AND BONNIE

                                BONNIE
                  No sign of Stefan?

                                ELENA
                  Mr. Danger Vibe?                                                                                  40.



                                BONNIE
                  All right, all right, I take it 
                  back.

                                ELENA
                  Can your psychic powers tell me if 
                  he s coming?

                                BONNIE
                  Go ahead, make fun of me.  I m sure 
                  the Druids were laughed at too.  

  But Bonnie closes her eyes, concentrating.  Tipsy.  Elena 
    watches her, amused.

                                ELENA
                  Is anything happening?

                                BONNIE
                  Just give me a minute.  I m 
                  supposed to concentrate...

                                ELENA
                  You need a crystal ball.  Wait --

  She grabs a beer bottle from the ground.  She places it in 
    Bonnie s hands.  They touch.  Suddenly, Bonnie s face shifts.  
  She grabs Elena s wrist.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Ow.  Easy --

    Bonnie stares into nothing.  Like she s in a trance.  Elena 
    pulls away -- snapping Bonnie out of it.  

                                BONNIE
                  Okay, that was weird.

                                ELENA
                  Ya think?  What happened?

                                BONNIE
                  I don t know.  I m drunk.  It s 
                  just, when I touched you, I saw a 
                  crow.

    Elena stops cold.

                                ELENA
                  What?

                                BONNIE
                  Yeah, I saw this black crow and...                                                                                  41.



                                ELENA
                  What else?

                                BONNIE
                          (remembering)
                  I felt scared -- or more like I 
                  should be scared...because the crow 
                  brings death.  Wait, that s not 
                  it...the crow brings the man and 
                  the man brings death.  Yeah, that s 
                  it.

    Elena is disturbed.  For that matter, so is Bonnie.

                                BONNIE (CONT D)
                  I need a drink.

  She heads off.  Elena turns around.  Stefan stands right in 
    front of her.

                                ELENA
                  Oh...

                                STEFAN
                  I did it again, didn t I?  Sorry.

  He smiles at her, charming and sheepish.  Then notices her 
    face.

                                STEFAN (CONT D)
                  You re upset about something.

                                ELENA
                  It s nothing.  My friend...she 
                  thinks she s ---
                        (shaking it off)
                  Never mind.  Hi.  You re here.

  She seems glad to see him.  As is he to see her.

                                STEFAN
                  I m here.

    ACROSS THE BONFIRE

    Jeremy throws back a drink.  Drains it.  Then, looks over to 
  see his sister Elena with Stefan across the way.  He ducks 
  out of sight.

  He moves through the crowd, recognizing his Stoner friends.  
  He heads over -- just as a GIGGLING Vicki disappears into the 
    woods with Tyler.  They re both drunk.                                                                                  42.



  ON ELENA AND STEFAN

    They stroll through the party, not really going anywhere, 
    just being together.  The FIRE CRACKLES behind them, casting 
    a romantic glow.

                                ELENA
                  You re kind of the talk of the 
                  town.

                                STEFAN
                  Am I?

                                ELENA
                  New guy, tragic past. Very 
                  mysterious.

                                STEFAN
                  How do you know it s tragic?

                                ELENA
                  You lost your parents.  

  To her it s that simple.  Stefan nods, agreeing.

                                STEFAN
                  What about you?  What s your sad 
                  story?

                                ELENA
                  What makes you think I have a sad 
                  story?

                                STEFAN
                  We met in a graveyard.

                                ELENA
                  Technically, we met in the Men s 
                  Room.

    They both smile.  Then, she turns to him quietly.  

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Last Spring, my parents  car went 
                  off a bridge into the lake.  I was 
                  in the backseat.  I survived.  They 
                  didn t.  That s my story.

    Silence.                                                                                    43.



                                STEFAN
                  Thank you for telling me.
                        (then)
                  You re right.  It s tragic.

                                ELENA
                  Yeah...it is.

  On both of them, united by tragedy.


    Jeremy is shit-faced.  He stumbles through the woods.  He 
    finds a spot, unzips and pees.

  He can hear a COUPLE making out.  He quickly finishes and 
    zips up -- moving towards the NOISE.  Through trees and 
    brush, he comes upon...

    VICKI AND TYLER

  He has her up against a tree.  They re all over each other.

  ON JEREMY -- completely bummed out.  He starts to leave when 
  he hears...

                                VICKI
                  No way, Ty.

  ON VICKI AND TYLER

    He s laughing, enjoying himself.  It s all fun and games with 
    him.  Vicki pushes him away with little success.

                                VICKI (CONT D)
                  I am not having sex against a tree.

                                TYLER
                  C mon, it ll be hot.

                                VICKI
                  For who?  Not going to happen.  Not 
                  here like this.  No, no, no...

    But, Tyler is persistent.  Aggressive, even.

                                VICKI (CONT D)
                  Ow, now that hurt.

    Jeremy comes out from the trees.

                                JEREMY
                  Leave her alone.                                                                                  44.



    Tyler pulls back.  A little breathless. 

                                TYLER
                  You re starting to get on my 
                  nerves, Gilbert.

                                VICKI
                  Just go, Tyler, get the hell away 
                  from me.

    Tyler gathers himself.  Playing it cool.

                                TYLER
                  Vicki Donovan says no.  There s a 
                  first.

    What a dick.  He heads off.  Vicki adjusts her clothing.

                                VICKI
                  I didn t need your help.

                                JEREMY
                  Seems like you did.

                                VICKI
                  He was just drunk.

                                JEREMY
                  I m drunk.  Am I throwing myself on 
                  you?  

                                VICKI
                  No, you re worse.  You wanna talk 
                  to me.  Get to know me.  Really, 
                  truly, deeply.  See into my soul.  
                  Be dazzled by my intelligence.  And 
                  screw and screw and screw until 
                  you re done with me.  

    Beat.  Jeremy stares at her.  Thrown by her drunken and very 
    honest outpouring.

                                JEREMY
                  Is that what you think?

                                VICKI
                  It s what I know.

  And with that Vicki takes off through the woods.                                                                                   45.




    Stefan and Elena are sitting by themselves, away from the 
    crowd.  

    They see Caroline with Bonnie nearby.  Caroline is trying not 
  to look at them, but she can t help herself.

                                STEFAN
                  I like Bonnie.  She s seems like a 
                  good friend.  Very loyal.

                                ELENA
                  Yes, the best.  

                                STEFAN
                  You might have to explain Caroline 
                  to me.

                                ELENA
                  She s one of my oldest friends.  
                  She s just playing some role she 
                  thinks she s supposed to.  As seen 
                  on TV.  But it s not really her.

                                STEFAN
                  And Matt?  Who can t keep his eyes 
                  off of us.

    Elena looks around.  Sure enough, Matt is with a GROUP OF 
    GIRLS, but he keeps glancing their way.

                                ELENA
                  Friends since pre-school.  Good 
                  friends.  But, somewhere along the 
                  way we had this notion we should be 
                  more than that, so we started to 
                  date.  It was comfortable, but 
                  not...

                                STEFAN
                  Passionate.

                                ELENA
                  No, it wasn t passionate.

    Elena looks directly into his eyes.  Then, she leans over and 
    touches his face, brushing his bangs aside.   A current moves 
    between them.  It s potent.  Stefan takes a deep breath.  
    Struggling a little.

                                STEFAN
                  Are you thirsty?                                                                                  46.



                                ELENA
                  A little.

                                STEFAN
                  Me too.  Here, let me.

  He takes her cup and then walks off, disappearing into the 
    crowd.  Elena waits, a little confused by his abrupt exit.


    Vicky is walking drunkenly through the brush.  A THICK, 
    MOVING MIST begins to swirl around her feet.  In moments the 
    ground is covered by a blanket of fog.

  She looks around.  The fog is everywhere.  Rising to waist 
    level.  A RUSTLE OF LEAVES makes her spin around.

                                VICKI
                  Jeremy?

  The BLACK CROW SWOOPS down from the trees.  Flying by her.

                                VICKI (CONT D)
                  Jesus.

  Her eyes dart up to the trees.  What the hell was that?  
    Suddenly, WHOOSH.  She s YANKED down, disappearing.

    A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.  And then SILENCE.




                                END OF ACT THREE                                                                                  47.


                                    ACT FOUR


    Elena approaches the keg.   Looking around.  She doesn t see 
    Stefan anywhere.  But Matt s there.

                                MATT
                  Looking for someone?

  She doesn t know what to say.  He pours a cup of beer, offers 
  it to her.  She takes it.  Thank you.  An awkward silence.

                                MATT (CONT D)
                  Elena, I m not so good with the 
                  awkward.

    Elena nods.  She s not either.

                                MATT (CONT D)
                  It s not us.  It never has been.  
                  That was the cool thing.  We were 
                  always easy.  

                                ELENA
                  Yes, we were--

                                MATT
                  You know this isn t the way I want 
                  things to be. But what I want isn t 
                  as important as what you need.  I m 
                  your friend, Elena.  So, I m here.  
                  For you.  Okay?

    A long silence.  Elena smiles softly.  Grateful.  Matt smiles 
    too.  There s a special bond between these two.  

    ACROSS THE FIRE

    Caroline sees Stefan heading for Elena.  Waylays him.

                                CAROLINE
                  There you are.

  She moves closer.  She s drunk and forward.

                                CAROLINE (CONT D)
                  Have you been down to the falls 
                  yet?  It s really cool at night, I 
                  can show you...if you want.

                                STEFAN
                  Are you drunk?                                                                                  48.



    Caroline GIGGLES.  

                                CAROLINE
                  Very drunk.  C mon, let s go, if 
                  the water s warm we can...

                                STEFAN
                  It s not going to happen.

                                CAROLINE
                  We can stay here if you want.

                                STEFAN
                  You and me.  We re not going to 
                  happen.  I m sorry, Caroline.

    Caroline is stung.  Not accustomed to rejection.  He gives 
  her a polite smile and walks away. 

  He heads for Elena, leaving Caroline in the dust.

  ON STEFAN AND ELENA

  As they come together.  Elena s amused.

                                ELENA
                  I was wondering who abducted you.  
                  Now I know.

                                STEFAN
                  Is she like this with all guys?

                                ELENA
                  You re fresh meat.  She ll back off 
                  eventually.
                        (noticing something)
                  You ve got to be kidding me.

    FOLLOW HER LOOK

    Jeremy is stumbling through the crowd.  Hammered.  

                                STEFAN
                  What is it?

                                ELENA
                  My brother.

                                STEFAN
                  The drunk kid?

                                ELENA
                  That s the one.  Excuse me?                                                                                  49.



                                STEFAN
                  You want help?

                                ELENA
                  Trust me.  You don t wanna witness 
                  this.  

    Elena hurries off.  She sees Jeremy heading into the woods.  
    Follows him.


  He weaves into a couple making out against a tree.  The GUY 
    pushes him away.

                                MAKE-OUT GUY
                  Bounce, moron.

                                JEREMY
                  My apologies.
                        (under his breath)
                  Douchewheel.

  He stumbles down the path.  Elena is gaining.

                                ELENA
                  Jeremy.  Jeremy!

  He keeps moving deeper into the woods.  Calling out.

                                JEREMY
                  I don t wanna hear it.

                                ELENA
                  Too bad.

  She picks up her pace.  Jeremy tries to run, pushing through 
  the brush.  He suddenly TRIPS and falls.  Over a BODY.

    It s Vicki.  Her eyes are wide open.  Staring into nothing.  
    Blood is everywhere.

                                JEREMY
                  Holy shit.  Vicki.
                        (shaking her)
                  VICKI.

    Elena reaches them.

                                ELENA
                  Oh my god.                                                                                  50.



    Suddenly Vicki lets out a RAGGED GASP.  It s a horrifying 
    sound.  Her hand GRABS Jeremy.  Her eyes pleading for help.


                                ELENA
                  Somebody help!!

    ANGLE ON ELENA as she comes out of the woods.  Jeremy is 
    carrying Vicki in his arms.  Everyone begins to take notice.  
    Matt pushes through the crowd. 

                                MATT
                  What the hell -- Vicky!

  He races to help his sister.  Instant panic.  Chaos.  A DIN 
  OF VOICES as everyone reacts.  Bonnie calls 911, Matt takes 
    Vicki, lays her down.  OTHERS crowd her, trying to help.  
    Tyler is freaked.

                                TYLER
                  What happened to her?

  On Stefan, staring in shock at the sight.  PUSH IN ON HIS 
    FACE as ONE VOICE cuts through the all else.

                                ELENA
                        (tunneled)
                  Her neck.  Something bit her.  It s 
                  bad, she s losing a lot of blood.

    Stefan is stunned.   He slowly backs away.  Freaked out.  

    Matt, tending to Vicki, catches a glimpse of Stefan s face.  
  He shakes it off, focused on his sister.  But he ll remember 
  it later.

    Stefan lets himself get swallowed up by the crowd.  And then, 
    with everyone s attention elsewhere, he RUNS.


    Matt climbs into the back of the AMBULANCE before it pulls 
    away.  POLICE question the remaining PARTIERS.  

  An ANIMAL CONTROL UNIT pulls in. 

    Bonnie comes up to Elena.  Her face tense and drawn.

                                BONNIE
                  We re gonna go mainline coffee and 
                  wait for news.

                                ELENA
                  I have to get Jeremy home.

    Bonnie nods, understanding.  Elena starts to go but senses 
    Bonnie is very withdrawn.  Haunted.  

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Bonnie?  What is it?  Are you okay?  
                  Don t freak yourself out with this 
                  psychic stuff. 

    Bonnie nods.                                                                                  54.



                                BONNIE
                  I know, I know...but, I m getting 
                  this crazy feeling that whatever 
                  happened tonight...is just 
                  beginning.

    Elena stares at her friend.  What is she talking about?

  ON JEREMY 

  He sits under a tree.  Glassy eyed.  Watching the scene 
    unfold before him.  He watches the AMBULANCE take off.  He 
    sees Elena walking over to him.  

                                ELENA
                  Let s go.  

    Jeremy staggers to his feet, silently.  Together, they walk 
    towards the road.  Suddenly...

    TYLER APPEARS -- ATTACKING JEREMY.  

                                TYLER
                  You sonofabitch.  Why did you leave 
                  her?

    Elena tries to break them apart.  But Tyler s too big, he has 
    Jeremy on the ground, straddling him, choking him.

                                TYLER (CONT D)
                  You were the last one with her.  
                  You left her in the woods.  

                                ELENA
                  Tyler, stop.  Get off him.

    Suddenly, TWO COPS appear -- they pull Tyler off Jeremy.  
    Jeremy sits up.  Elena looks at her brother, but he s staring 
  at the ground.  Guilt-ridden.


    Shards of glass rain down as they land on the ground with a 
    thud. 





                                END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                  57.


                                      ACT SIX


    Stefan lies flat on the ground.  SHATTERED GLASS all around.   
  He rises, rubs his head.  He s back to himself.  He stands.  
    Looks up to the attic.  Sees the broken window.  Turns to 
    find Damon leaning against a tree.

                                DAMON
                  I was impressed.  I give it a six.  
                  Missed on style, but I was 
                  pleasantly surprised.  Really good 
                  with the whole face ARRGGGGHHH. 

                                STEFAN
                  Stay away from her.

                                DAMON
                  You just proved you can t make 
                  requests.  So, this Elena.  You 
                  think she d go for an older man?  

                                STEFAN
                  Everything is fun and games with 
                  you.  But wherever you go, people 
                  die. 

                                DAMON
                  That s a given.

                                STEFAN
                  Not here.  I won t allow it.  

                                DAMON
                  Where s your ring?

    Stefan stops cold.  Looks to his hand.  His ring is missing.  
    Instant panic.  Anger.

                                DAMON (CONT D)
                  Couple of hours, the sun comes up, 
                  and poof.  Ashes to ashes.

    Stefan tries to keep his anger in check.  

                                DAMON (CONT D)
                  Relax.  Here.

    Damon holds his hand out.  The ring lies in his palm.  We 
    notice Damon has the exact same one on his hand.  Stefan goes 
  to him, takes the ring, slips it on when...                                                                                  58.



    DAMON GRABS HIM BY THE THROAT - COMPLETELY PICKING HIM UP AND  
    THROWING HIM ACROSS THE YARD WITH INHUMAN STRENGTH.  

  He hits the side of the house.  Freefalls to the ground.  
    Damon walks to where Stefan lies.  For the first time, 
    Damon s face turns PURE EVIL.  Without question -- he can go 
    there. 

                                DAMON (CONT D)
                  You should know better than to 
                  think you re stronger than me.  You 
                  lost that fight when you stopped 
                  feeding on people.  I wouldn t try 
                  it again -- brother.  

    And, instantly, Damon is back to his charming self.  

                                DAMON (CONT D)
                  I think we woke Pete up. 

    Damon walks away, leaving Stefan in a crumbled heap.


    Elena pulls the car into the drive.  She and Jeremy sit 
    there.  Neither in a hurry to get out of the car.  Then...

                                ELENA
                  People are gonna stop giving you 
                  breaks, Jer, because they don t 
                  care anymore.  They don t remember 
                  our parents our dead.  They re too 
                  busy living their lives.  The rest 
                  of the world has moved on.  You 
                  have to try too.

                                JEREMY
                  Like you?  I ve seen you at the 
                  cemetery.  Writing in your diary.  
                  Is that you moving on?

    Silence.  Elena shrugs.  She s at a loss.

                                ELENA
                  Mom and Dad wouldn t want this.

                                JEREMY
                  Then it s a good thing they re not 
                  here.  

  And with that Jeremy gets out of the car.  Still angry, still 
    restless.  Still on a dangerous path.  And from the look on 
    Elena s face, she knows it.


    Elena sits out on the veranda, curled in a blanket, writing 
  in her journal.

                                ELENA (V.O.)
                  I thought that I could smile and 
                  nod my way through it.  Pretend 
                  like it would all be okay.


                                ELENA (V.O.)
                  All you can do is be ready for the 
                  good, so that when it comes, you 
                  let it in.  Because you need it.
                        (beat)
                  I need it.

    Elena stands, opens the front door.  Then, from offscreen.

                                STEFAN
                  Elena.

  She turns.  He s standing on her front walk.

                                ELENA
                  Stefan.                                                                                  62.



  He walks towards her, joining her at the door.  Stopping just 
    inches from the threshold.  She stares at him, drinking in 
  his face.

                                STEFAN
                  I know it s late.  But I needed to 
                  know that you were okay.

    Elena has to smile to herself.

                                ELENA
                  You know, for months that s all 
                  anyone has wondered about me.  If 
                  I m okay.

                                STEFAN
                  What do you tell them?

                                ELENA
                  I tell them I ll be fine.

                                STEFAN
                  Did you ever mean it?

                                ELENA
                  Ask me tomorrow.

    Their eyes connect.  Two lost souls drawn to each other.  
    Elena shivers.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  It s warmer in the house.  We can 
                  talk...

  She walks away from the door, but once again Stefan can t 
    enter.  Until Elena turns...

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Don t you want to come inside?

    Stefan smiles.  Genuine, heartfelt.
