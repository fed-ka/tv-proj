      EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT - A BROKEN DOWN WAREHOUSE

      on the edge of Slagtown is being used as a refuge by a 
      group of hoboes. A fire is burning in an oil drum, casting 
      flickering shadows across the crumbling walls.

      A hulking MAN enters the frame, lumbering toward the group 
      - and as he gets closer we see that these aren't human 
      hoboes, but NEWCOMERS. Getting loaded on SOUR MILK. The man 
      reacts with disgust and annoyance, veering off toward an 
      inner part of the structure where a smaller fire is 
      burning. He steps over a couple of unconscious Newcomers, 
      seeing

      A HUMAN VAGRANT - AMONG THE SHADOWS

      shifting uncomfortably in some squalor.

                                  THE MAN
                    Lincoln? That you?

      The Vagrant grunts affirmatively. The Man sits nearby.

                                  THE MAN
                    Good t'see a human. Gettin' so y'can't even 
                    find a decent place to crash any more.
                            (pulling out a bottle)
                    Damn, but I hate those slags. Can you 
                    believe they're trying t'give 'em the right 
                    t'vote? Shoot. They don't even get drunk 
                    right. Whoever hearda getting loaded on 
                    sour milk when y'can have some good 
                    squeeze.

      The Vagrant's body SHIVERS, he GROANS. He's suffering.

                                  THE MAN
                    Y'don't sound too good. Y'want a taste?

      He extends the bottle to The Vagrant, who leans forward, 
      bringing his face into the flickering firelight. It's 
      grotesque. Splotched with ugly SORES. There are dark 
      patches of SLIMY STAIN on his clothes. His hand is likewise 
      infected with sores as he grabs the bottle. Takes a greedy 
      slug. Holds it back out to the man                                  THE MAN
                    Uh... why don't y'keep it. ...What happened 
                    t'you, Linc?

      The Vagrant's breathing grows MORE labored. He torches one 
      of the sores, flinches in AGONY. His breathing accelerates.

                                  THE MAN
                    Hey, y'know there's a free clinic over on 
                    third and -

                                    A VOICE
                    Mr. Lincoln... I've been looking for you.

      The man looks up to see a NEWCOMER in a Salvation Army 
      uniform. The Newcomer smiles with benevolent concern.

                                  THE NEWCOMER
                    We've been worried about you at the 
                    mission, you missed several meals and -

      The Vagrant stares at the Newcomer, then suddenly BELLOWS 
      with pain. His eyes flash wildly!

                                  THE MAN
                    Linc! What the hell!?

      The Vagrant skitters clumsily away from the Newcomer, 
      shoves The Man aside. ROARS!

      THE NEWCOMERS BY THE FIRE DRUM

      react, startled when they see The Vagrant barreling blindly 
      toward them, HOWLING! He plows violently through them, 
      knocking them aside, overturning the fire drum, rushing 
      headlong against a wall. He rebounds, his hands clutching 
      his head, trying to suppress the searing PAIN within! He 
      runs in aimless agony up a decaying staircase.

                                  THE MAN
                    Linc! Stop! Don't go up there!

                                  THE NEWCOMER
                    Mr. Lincoln!

      But The Vagrant rushes higher, bouncing off the old brick 
      walls. The Salvation Army Newcomer is nervously pursuing 
      him up the rickety stairs - finally reaching a high landing       where The Vagrant has sunk to his knees in excruciating 
      torment.

                                  THE NEWCOMER
                    Mr. Lincoln, please - let me -

      He reaches out, but The Vagrant SHOUTS, recoils violently 
      against the rusty handrail - which gives way. He looks 
      down, cries with pain -

      And JUMPS three stories to his DEATH on the rubble below.

      EXT. A MIDDLE - CLASS SUBURBAN STREET - DAY - A WOMAN

      carrying a flowering plant with a ribbon on it, is walking 
      toward a house where a moving van is unloading. A few other 
      PEOPLE stand or pass nearby, their focus also on the house. 
      They seem curious, stand-offish, and not at all pleased.

      The woman reaches the front door just as a NEWCOMER WOMAN, 
      SUSAN, appears, wearing jeans and a faded Dodger 
      sweatshirt. They startle each other.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    Oh! Sorry.

                                  SUSAN
                            (smiling)
                    S'okay.
                          (to a mover with box)
                    In the dining room... thanks.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    I'm Diane Mitchell. The blue house over 
                    there.

                                  SUSAN
                    Susan Francisco. Hi.

                                  DIANE
                          (re the plant)
                    A little "welcome to the neighborhood" 
                    gift.

                                  SUSAN
                            (surprised, touched)
                    It's beautiful. And really nice of you. 
                                  (MORE)                                  SUSAN (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.

                                  DIANE
                    Well, I've moved a few times myself. 
                    Sometimes it can be kinda traumatic.

      Susan has been glancing out at the less friendly neighbors.

                                  SUSAN
                    Yeah.

                                  DIANE
                    I was going to bring some of my world - 
                    famous chocolate fudge, ...but I didn't 
                    know if you ate that sort of -

                                  SUSAN
                    I love it. But my hips don't.
                              (mischievously)
                    ...Bring it anyway.

      A frowning nine year old NEWCOMER GIRL appears.

                                  THE GIRL
                    Mom - I don't feel good.

                                  SUSAN
                    Probably just nerves, honey. This is 
                    Emily. ...Ms. Mitchell.

                                  DIANE
                    Diane. Hi, Emily.

                                  EMILY
                    Hi.

                                  DIANE
                    Wow, you sure look like your mom. ...Uh, I 
                    mean, y'know...

      Emily shrugs, shyly. Another mover approaches.

                                  SUSAN A MAN (O.S.)
                    That goes in the kitchen. Sus? Susan? Just 
                    a sec!                                  EMILY
                    Mom, my stomach hurts.

                                  DIANE
                    Look, I know you're busy. My phone number's 
                    on the card there if I can help.

                                  SUSAN
                    That's dangerous, y'know. I just might 
                    call.

                                  DIANE
                    Do.

                                  SUSAN
                          (a smile)
                    Wouldn't want to interrupt you making 
                    fudge, though.

      INT. THE HOUSE - GEORGE FRANCISCO

      moves out of the bedroom, weaving through the boxes, 
      pulling on his suit jacket. (The dialogue is fast, 
      overlapping.)

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan? Where'd you put my keys?

                                  SUSAN
                    On the box. Look at this plant a lady down 
                    the street brought.

                                  EMILY
                    Mom, it really hurts.

                                  GEORGE
                    On the box. Now that's helpful.

                                  SUSAN
                            (gently, to Emily)
                    'Cause it's your first day in a new school, 
                    Em. It'll be okay.

                                  GEORGE
                    which box?                                  SUSAN
                    Try to eat a little more breakfast, Emmy.
                            (picking up keys)
                    ...Some detective.

                                  GEORGE
                            (pulling her close)
                    Are you giving me a hard time?

                                  SUSAN
                    Yes. You get to run off and play cops and 
                    robbers while I -

                                  GEORGE
                    Have the pleasure of moving into our new 
                    home. Where'd this plant come from?

                                  SUSAN
                    God help the LAPD. I just told you. Are 
                    there any signs of life from your son?

                                  GEORGE
                            (holding her, shouting)
                    Buck! Off and On!

                                  SUSAN
                    Thanks, I needed that.

                                  GEORGE
                          (re the plant)
                    A lady from down the street. See? I listen. 
                    Maybe you did all that worrying for 
                    nothing.

                                  SUSAN
                            (unconvinced)
                    ...Maybe.

                                  GEORGE

                                  Buck!?

      A fifteen year old Newcomer shuffles out, sleepy, and 
      annoyed.

                                  BUCK
                    ...I'm coming. But will y'please call me 
                    Finiksa and not that dumb tert name.      EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - FROM ACROSS THE STREET

      A ten year old (JILL) and her frowning MOTHER watch as 
      George kisses Susan and Emily goodbye.

                                  JILL'S MOTHER
                    I can't believe it, after all we paid for 
                    this house and all we've put into it.

                                  JILL
                    What's wrong?

                                  JILL'S MOTHER
                    Our property's not gonna be worth half of 
                    what we've paid.

                                  JILL
                    Why?

                                  JILL'S MOTHER
                    Why do you think. ...Damn slags.

      The woman casts a last searing look toward George's house, 
      and walks back inside, muttering an angry profanity. Jill 
      watches her, then looks back at Emily, who meets her eyes.

      EXT. A CEMETERY - DAY - A GRAVESTONE

      marks the final resting place of "Sergeant William Tuggles, 
      LAPD - B:1950 D:l991." A man's hand places a small bunch of 
      flowers on the grave.

                                  THE MAN (O.S.)
                    Can't believe y'been gone a month already, 
                    Tuggs.

      ANGLE ACROSS THE GRAVESTONE TO THE MAN

      This is Detective Lieutenant MATTHEW SIKES. He stares at 
      the grave, speaks quietly...

                                  SIKES
                    ...Really miss ya, man.
                          (a pause)
                    ...Least I nailed the slag who got you, 
                    huh? ...Yeah. Big deal.

      He stares at the grave a moment longer, feeling the       frustration of his loss and inability to have done more. 
      Finally he sighs and turns away.

      INT. THE POLICE STATION COFFEE ROOM - DAY - SGT. DOBBS

      a black, plainclothes cop, is pouring coffee into his 
        PERSONALIZED MUG, speaking to Sikes, who's back is to us.

                                  DOBBS
                    This slag comes in with a duck under his 
                    arm. So the bartender says, "what's the pig 
                    want to drink?" The slag says, "It's not a 
                    pig, it's a duck." And the bartender says -

                                  SIKES
                            (turning to him)
                    "I'm Talkin' to the duck."

                                  DOBBS
                    Awwww, y'heard it.

                                  SIKES
                    I heard 'em all.

      George appears in the doorway behind them. They're unaware.

                                  DOBBS
                    Yeah I guess you woulda. Givin' a slag for 
                    a new partner.

                                  SIKES
                    He's not my partner okay Dobbs? My partner 
                    got killed in a shoot-out, remember? This 
                    putz is just an assignment.

                                  DOBBS
                    Teach ya t'mouth off at the old man, huh? 
                    Grazer gets promoted to captain and you get 
                    a slag partn - "assignment."
                            (imitating their chief)
                    "What the hell you think you are, Sikes,

      Dobbs smiles. Shows off his tap dance. Albert has picked up 
      the trash can, but the fluorescent tube he's carrying 
      NUDGES Dobbs' personalized mug - causing it to fall onto

      EXT. EUCLID ELEMENTARY - DAY - AN ANGRY WOMAN

      on the back of a pickup is shouting through a megaphone.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    Yes, I'm a Purist, and I'm proud of its 
                    These damn slags were bred to be slaves - 
                    so let 'em be slaves!

      A MOB of two hundred of MIXED ETHNICITY is gathered outside 
      the school. Many SHOUT agreement. Others, including a few 
      Newcomers, BOO loudly!

                                  THE WOMAN
                    And they breed like rabbits - only four 
                    months instead of nine - pretty soon there 
                    won't be any room left for the rest of use

      SHOUTS from BOTH viewpoints, "Damn rights Tell 'em!" - 
      "They're smarter than you are, lady!" etc. Police cars roll 
      in, Sikes & George among them.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    We shouldn't give 'em the right to vote and 
                    we shouldn't let 'em into our schools! This 
                    has always been a good school. We gotta 
                    keep it that way! We don't want her kind 
                    here!

      The woman points toward Emily, being held shelteringly by 
      Susan - and facing a line of parents with their arms 
        interlocked, blocking entrance into the school. A SUPPORT 
      GROUP around Emily REACT ANGRILY against the woman's 
      contingent.

                    She doesn't live there anymore.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    Let her move back!

      More VOCALIZATION from the mob. Some for, others against. 
      It's getting ANGRIER. George has found Susan and Emily. 
      Sikes holds back slightly.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    They learn too fast. It's unnatural They're 
                    already taking too many jobs. Our jobs! We 
                    let her in here now, there'll be a hundred 
                    more next weeks

                    know they're really safe!?

      The crowd REACTS LOUDLY both PRO and CON. Jill watches 
      Emily, who's stoic.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    I say we run 'em back to Slagtown - and we 
                    do it now!

      Both factions of the crowd ROAR! But those on Emily's side 
      are clearly outnumbered. There's about to be a RIOT. 
      Suddenly a GUNSHOT startles everyone! They look toward the 
      man with the smoking gun. It's Sikes. He takes stage, 
      BELLOWING -

                    be a piece o'cake! Let's start with this 
                    one right here.

      He takes Emily very gently by the arm, WINKING 
      supportively.

                    kids, we can beat that out of hers 
                      Discourage her enough and she'll give up.

      He holds out his gun to one of the linked-arm protesters.

      The black man can't sustain the intensity of Sikes glares 
      The man drops his eyes, and his arms. The line is broken.

      George and Susan watch as Sikes walks Emily to the door, 
      where he eyes the principal and a couple of teachers. 
      Including a BLACK WOMAN.                                  SIKES

      He gives her another wink. Her eyes hold on his for a beat. 
      She gathers in some of his courage, and goes inside. The 
      Black Teacher puts a welcoming arm around Emily's shoulder.

      Sikes watches her disappear, has a PRIVATE MOMENT of his 
      own, then turns to face the crowd.

      The crowd begins to disperse. Some pleased, others mumbling 
      angrily. Sikes' eyes fall on George who is gazing at him. 
      Sikes looks away.

      showing a smiling Newcomer between two human doctors, each 
      of whom hold a stethoscope to the Newcomer's chest. The 
      copy reads: "Not all of us have two hearts. Take care of

      Newcomer, whom we don't see well enough to recognize, is on

      sit amid half-unpacked moving boxes at their kitchen table.

                                  SUSAN
                    We were both proud of you, honey. I'm not 
                    saying I wasn't proud of her - just that 
                    it's a terrible strain for her to be under.

                                  GEORGE
                    Was it, Emmy?

                                  SUSAN
                    Tell your father how they stared at you.

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah they did a lot. But I figured they 
                    would. Like you said.

                                  SUSAN
                    And the wisecracks.

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah, I heard some. Couple kids smiled at 
                    me, though.

                                  GEORGE
                    Did you make any friends?

                                  EMILY
                    Just Ms. Murdoch, my teacher.

                                  SUSAN
                    See what I mean.

                                  GEORGE
                    It was her first day, Sus, you have to give 
                    it a little time. Think you can give it 
                    some time, Em?

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah. ...I like the school.

                    You do?                                  EMILY
                    Yeah. It's nicer than the one I went to 
                    before. It has bigger windows and more 
                    light. Not like those trailers. And there's 
                      a computer right in the rooms Ms. Murdoch 
                    taught me how to write my name on it!

                                  GEORGE
                    You liked that.

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah. It was really neat!

                                  GEORGE
                    Is this your homework?

                                  EMILY
                    Uh huh. Just math. It's easy.

                                  SUSAN
                    Will you help her with it while I get 
                    dinner?

                                  EMILY
                    I don't need any help, momma.

      George looks at Susan. Allows himself a little, proud 
      smile. Susan rises, straightens the counter tops. Buck 
      enters.

                                  GEORGE
                    How was it at your school, Buck?

                    I want you to use your English name now.

                    Please use it. How was your school?

                                  BUCK
                    It was okay.
                          (he exits)

                                  SUSAN
                    You didn't eat much lunch, Em.

                                  EMILY
                    Wasn't too hungry.

                                  SUSAN
                    Did anybody eat with you?

                                  EMILY
                            (intent on her homework)
                    Huh? No.

      Susan's jaw sets. George pats Emily's arm, goes to Susan.

                                  GEORGE
                      ...What...?

                                  SUSAN
                            (quiet, intense)
                    What do you think! How do you think I feel 
                    knowing that she's sitting there at lunch 
                    all by herself.

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm sure that happens to a lot of kids on 
                    their first day.

      She turns. Stares at him a moment. Then turns sharply away.

                                  SUSAN
                    Right, George.

      He watches her a moment. Eases off the subject.

                                  GEORGE
                    Matt was rather amazing, wasn't he?                                  SUSAN
                            (softening slightly)
                    Yes, he was. I called to thank him. Left a 
                    message on his machine. Invited him over.

                                  GEORGE
                    He only said about ten words to me the rest 
                    of the day.

                                  SUSAN
                    ...That's more than Emmy got.

      She moves off. George stands, silently.

      EXT. SIKES' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT - SIKES

      is just coming home to this place which is past it's prime.

      INT. SIKES' APARTMENT - SECOND FLOOR - THE ELEVATOR

      which works sometimes, opens, Sikes gets out, noticing two 
      moving men struggling to get a bureau into an apartment.

                                  A WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Yeah, that's it. Little bit left.

      He pauses to check out his new neighbor. And as the movers 
      go in through the door they reveal CATHY - an attractive 
      female NEWCOMER. She finds herself looking right at Sikes. 
      Smiles.

                                  CATHY
                    Hi.

      Sikes nods. She disappears into her flat. Sikes turns to 
      unlock his door. Majorly disgruntled.

                      Wonderful. ...Why My building?

      He is unlocking his door when Cathy reappears, carrying a 
      cardboard file box.

                    A woman dropped this off, asked me to give 
                    it to you.

                    Thanks.

      He goes inside, closes the door. Cathy stares at it, 
      wryly...

      corner. He looks curiously at the file box, starts to open

      mess off of her hands.

      A couple of other kids nearby SEEM SYMPATHETIC, but say 
      nothing. Then Emily's neighbor, Jill, passes by, speaking 
      aside:

                    Just let it dry a little, then rub your 
                    hands together. It'll come right Off.

      Jill keeps walking past, but glances back to see if Emily 
      heard. Emily is about to say thanks, but Jill disappears       among some other kids. Emily is curious about her.

                    You just have a fondness for old buildings?

      Sikes doesn't answer. He has bent open a section of chain 
      link fence and gone onto the property. George follows, 
      muttering,

      The nearby door is padlocked. Be finds an iron bar nearby 
      and slips it through the lock, straining to break it. But 
      he can't. George walks up slowly.                                  GEORGE

      George applies his surprising strength to the bar and snaps

      She frowns, stares at him as he looks very carefully at a 
      table top, then sets down his armload of stuff. She catches 
      a glimpse of his shoulder holster and pistol. Gets a trifle 
      uneasy...

      Ignoring her, he pulls out a pen and uses it to accurately 
      measure where some knick-knacks are placed on a shelf, and 
      the specific inch that a drawer is open.                                  CATHY

                    Sure, thanks. ...What exactly was that?

                    A male and female who lived eons ago and 
                      sacrificed themselves to save millions. We 
                    try to live by their example.

                    We touch our fingers to each of our two 
                    hearts, then reverse them to show that the 
                    male and female are interchangeable. We 
                    touch our heads to bring their purity and 
                    goodness within us.

                    We invited Matt tonight because of how he 
                    stood up for Emily yesterday... and to also

      INT. BUCK'S ROOM

      dark and messy, with an edge. A couple of disturbing ICONS. 
      He's THRUMMING on a curious INSTRUMENT that's part guitar 
      and part drum as George enters.

                                  GEORGE
                    What was the reason for that?

                    It's better than being slaves.

                          (a smug laugh)
                    We still are slaves! You know how much 
                    smarter we are than terts?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes.

                                  BUCK
                    Then why stroke 'em?

                                  GEORGE
                    To be more accepted. We're different, Buck. 
                    It's written all over us. There's a natural 
                      resentment against us. So we have to be 
                    better, more patient - just to be accepted 
                    as even equal. We have to adapt.

                                  BUCK
                    It's a lotta crap. We should be able to be 
                    what we are, man. Without the brown-nosing.

                                  GEORGE
                    It takes time, Buck. But look at the 
                    progress already. We're in a better 
                      neighborhood-

                                  BUCK
                    Where half the people won't talk to us.

                                  GEORGE
                    Change happens slowly. But some Newcomers 
                    are already crossing - over. Because of 
                    their skill or intelligence. Look at Dr. 
                    Fallon at Cal Tech, or Chuck Winslow who 
                    just signed with the Dodgers.

                                  BUCK
                    Just P.R., man.                                  GEORGE
                    No, it's because he's a great hitter. And 
                    how 'bout Martine Bennett on the L.A. city 
                    council?

                                  BUCK
                    Right. But does she get a vote?

                                  GEORGE
                    If Proposition 16 passes she will - we all 
                    will.

                                  BUCK
                    Good luck. you seen the opinion polls?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes. There's almost a fifty-fifty chance. A 
                    lot of humans want us to vote.

                                  BUCK
                    And a lot of them don't.

                                  GEORGE
                    It could go either way, you're right - but 
                    that means that almost half of the people 
                    are on our side.

                                  BUCK
                    Well I haven't met any of 'em.

                                  GEORGE
                    Maybe you're not looking in the right 
                    places. ...C'mon and have dinner with us, 
                    will you?

                                  BUCK
                    I'm really not hungry.

      He thrums sullenly on his instrument. George sighs.

      INT. A SHADOWY ROOM - NIGHT - THE FACE OF THE DEAD VAGRANT

      Two NEWCOMERS dressed in surgical gowns and masks lean over 
      the body, carefully inspecting the sores, testing samples.

      The atmosphere is very tense.                                  THE NEWCOMER SURGEON
                    {It's much worse than I thought.}

                                  THE OTHER NEWCOMER
                    {What do we do?}

                                  THE NEWCOMER SURGEON
                    {I don't know. ...Pray?}

      He wipes his brow. Looks at the other surgeon. Then BLACK.


 


                                       ACT THREE

      INT. GEORGE & SUSAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      George lies on his stomach on their bed, only a sheet 
      covering the lower part of his body. Susan is in the 
      bathroom.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                    Mostly it's because he's a teen-ager.

                                  GEORGE
                    ...Maybe.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                    Why don't we just tell him it's not working 
                    out, and to please come back when he's 
                    grown.

                                  GEORGE
                          (a smirk)
                    Now that's an idea.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                          (a pause)
                    Why do you think that factory smelled like 
                    our spacecraft?

                                  GEORGE
                    I don't know.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                    Was Matt impressed that you could smell 
                    something he couldn't?

                                  GEORGE
                    More annoyed, I think. He spends a lot of 
                    time annoyed.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                    Diane - the woman who brought us that plant 
                    I'm trying not to kill - I saw her in the 
                    market and she was amazed that I could 
                    smell and see the pesticides on the 
                    produce. Made me promise to pick out all 
                    her fruit from now on.

      She comes out wearing a thin nightie. The light from the       bathroom behind her outlines her body underneath. Alien or 
      not, she looks like someone you'd went to have pick out 
      your fruit.

                                  SUSAN
                    The produce manager was pretty annoyed with 
                    Me. Heard him whisper I had a head like an 
                    over-ripe crenshaw melon. I don't think 
                    they realize how acute our senses are.

                                  GEORGE
                    No, they don't. Thanks for having Matt 
                    over.

                                  SUSAN
                            (settling beside him)
                    No problem.

                                  GEORGE
                    You made him very comfortable.

                                  SUSAN
                            (stroking his back)
                    Would you like me to make you comfortable?

                                  GEORGE
                    Wellll...

                                  SUSAN
                            (mimicking)
                    Wellll... I saw you lying here with your 
                    back exposed... waiting for a little 
                    hummer...

      She leans down, touches her lips just below his shoulder 
      blade, and HUMS a long note. George's body relaxes with a 
      wave of warm sexuality. Susan moves her lips slightly and 
      HUMS a slightly lower, longer note. George closes his eyes 
      and breathes deeply.

      He reaches around and MASSAGES a spot on the back of her 
      knee - and Susan draws a breath of pure sexual pleasure.

                                  SUSAN
                    Oooo... yes...

      She HUMS on his back again, getting into it. Until he       chuckles...

                                  SUSAN
                    ...I beg your pardon...?

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm sorry I was just thinking...you know in 
                    their movies, particularly that X-Rated 
                    video we rented, how humorous we find some 
                    of their foreplay rituals...

                                  SUSAN
                    Mmmm hmmm...

      She HUMS on his back again, clearly getting a rise out of 
      him. Her body moves sensually...

                                  SUSAN
                      Well,...you know what they say...
                            (humming on him again)

                                  GEORGE
                          (a breathless whisper)
                    ...What do they... say...?

                                  SUSAN
                      {Different strokes for different folks.}

                                  GEORGE
                            (embracing her)
                    { ...Is that what they say...}

                                  SUSAN
                      Mmmmmmmm....

      He increases the stimulation behind her knee, her body 
      arches with ecstatic pleasure...

      EXT. A WEATHERED BILLBOARD FOR THE UNITED WAY - DAY

      features the smiling face of a Newcomer. A smaller poster 
      has been stuck on it reading, Keep America Pure - Vote NO 
      on 16." The camera tilts down to find Sikes & George 
      getting out of their car.                                  SIKES
                    Fifty bucks I lost on the Cowboys, man.

                                  GEORGE
                    Can't factor the turnovers, Matt. Nobody's 
                    perfect.

      A young Latino comes out the front door of an apartment. 
      Senses cops. Ducks back in.

                                  SIKES
                    Hey! You! Halt!
                    Sikes bolts inside, chasing the guy up the 
                    stairs.

      THE NEXT LANDING - THE LATINO

      runs for all he's worth. Sikes pumps up the steps behind.

      EXT. THE ROOF - THE LATINO

      explodes out of a door and runs frantically across the roof 
      to a fire escape. He scrambles downward with Sikes in hot

      Jill returns to her desk, glances back to see Emily 
      touching the back of her smooth head. Then Emily feels 
      Jill's eyes, they share a glance. Then Emily goes back to 
      work. But Jill keeps looking at her. Pondering something.

                    He just wants t'be neighborly.

                    That's right. Get t'know ya. ...Real good.

      He starts to maul her - and she brings up her knee hard in 
      his groin - SHOUTING ANGRILY to a passing car -

                    Help me!

      The car keeps going, the third man tries to muzzle her -

                    You little slag bitch!

      He backhands her, spinning her against the car - but Cathy 
      comes right back and nails him with a powerful roundhouse 
      left. She breaks away, stumbles, scrapes her knee. The 
      first man grabs a handful of her shirt - rips it violently, 
      exposing her back, but she kicks at him, keeps going.

      She runs around a corner and right into - Sikes.

                    trouble. ...Thank ya.

                    Then the sl- The Newcomer inside switched 
                      artillery.

      The powerful rifle BLOWS a hole right through the car next 
      to a startled Tuggs! He backs along the car - as additional 
      shells BLAST through.

                    I was pinned. Couldn't cover him. Some

                    ...Yeah. Anyway, Old Tuggs ran out of cover 
                    - he was leaning back against the car and 
                    the last shell... went right through him.

                    No. By the time I got to him it was over.

      A CRASH off camera. They look over to see that

      ALBERT

      has just dropped one of the heavy C02 extinguishers which 
      tips over and lands on Dobbs' foot! He yelps! Hops back 
      falling over a chair.

                                  DOBBS
                    You stupid - ahhg!

                                  ALBERT
                    Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

      Albert grabs for the extinguisher - the wrong way - it 
      fires a cloud of C02 right into his face. His eyes roll 
      back and he falls flat out cold behind a desk.

      The Forensics Doctor, Lee, walks right through the midst of 
      the tangle as if nothing were happening. Goes to Sikes.                                  LEE

      EXT. GEORGE'S STREET - DAY - SUSAN

      is jogging, wearing a lived-in sweat suit. She's been at it 
      a while, and tiring, but determined. Then ahead of her she 
      sees a FEMALE NEWCOMER, walking the same direction. Unusual 
      for this neighborhood. Her clothes are poor, but clean. 
      Susan reaches her just as the female starts up a walk 
      toward a house.

                                  SUSAN
                    Hiya.

                                  THE FEMALE
                    ...Hello.

                                  SUSAN
                    Nice t'see another shiny head. I Didn't 
                    know anybody lived around here but us.

                                  THE FEMALE
                    You live near here?                                  SUSAN
                    Three houses up on the right.

                                  THE FEMALE
                    Oh, well, I don't. I just-

                                    ANOTHER WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Miranda?

      They look up to see the fifty-ish HOMEOWNER. Red hair and 
      clothes are trendy but overdone.

                                  TEE HOMEOWNER
                    Get on up here, girl. I suppose you're 
                    going to tell me the bus was late again.

                                  THE FEMALE
                    Yes, maam it-

                                  THE HOMEOWNER
                    Never mind, just get on in here and get to 
                    work. And what'd I tell you about not 
                    bringing your friends along-
                          (to Susan)
                    You get along, missy. You're probably late 
                    for your job, too.

      The homeowner turns abruptly and hustles her Newcomer maid 
      inside. Susan stares after them, amazed, amused, and 
      pissed.

                    is interviewing several people, including 
                    THE WOMAN PURIST who was inciting the mob 
                    at Emily's school.

                                  THE PURIST
                    There's a real danger, I'm telling you!

                    Yes, you've said that again and again, Mrs. 
                    Brett, but if you'll forgive me it sounds a 
                    little hysterical. What I-

                                  A MAN (PURIST LEADER)
                    It's not hysterical. What we Purists stand 
                    for is very simple - and very wholesome: we 
                    don't want our kids polluted by their kind.

                                    GERALDO
                    And you'll use force if necessary?

                                  THE PURIST LEADER
                    We are committed to using whatever means 
                      necessary.

      Audience REACTION, both pro and con, is heard. Someone 
      shouts, "You ought to be committed." Geraldo turns to 
      another MAN who sits beside a distinguished NEWCOMER.

                                    GERALDO
                    Alright, but Dr. Burwitz, is there any sort 
                    of medical basis for Mrs. Brett's claim 
                    that the Newcomers could be carrying a 
                    virus that makes AIDS look like chicken 
                    pox?

                                  DR. HURWITZ
                    Well... We have no evidence that such a 
                    virus exists.

                                    GERALDO
                    But it could exist?                                  DR. HURWITZ
                    Well, there were those of us who argued 
                    that the quarantine period may not have 
                    been sufficiently long enough to thoroughly 
                    isolate extraterrestrial bacteria, but-

                                    GERALDO
                    So such a virus could exist.

                                  THE PURIST LEADER
                    And that's exactly why we never should have 
                    let the damned aliens outs - And now this 
                    elitist conspiracy to give them the vote.

                                  THE DISTINGUISHED NEWCOMER
                    Can we please stick to the subject we 
                    agreed on -

                                  THE PURIST LEADER

                    Just sit the hell back down there, boy - we 
                    want some straight answers and we want-

      The Newcomer struggles to rise. The Purist Leader grapples 
      with him. Geraldo intervenes. The audience REACTS wildly!

      He flips the channel. A BASKETBALL GAME comes on. The 
      camera follows two NEWCOMER PLAYERS. They are DAZZLING.

                                  ANNOUNCER
                    And once again the two newest additions to 
                    the Bruins proved that their skills could 
                    leave their opponents in the dust. Chip 
                    Weston and Nicholas Nickleby led their team

                    to a staggering 113 to 75 upset over 
                    Loyola. Prompting Coach Jim Harrick to quip 
                    that other teams oughta be allowed to play 
                    with seven men against UCLA.

      The crowd, which includes several Newcomers is cheering 
      wildly, carrying the Newcomer heroes on their shoulders. 
      Even Buck and some of the toughs are pleased, "Alright! 
      Show the terts! Way to go!" etc. Until Svabo and Blentu 
      SMIRK.

      peer from an alley. One is the young tough who had seen 
      Buck and company yesterday. He is pointing out to the other 
      where Buck's gang has taken up residence. The youths look 
      vengeful.

      INT. EMILY'S CLASSROOM - DAY - EMILY & JILL

      are alone in the room. The others are playing outside.

                                  JILL
                    I got it out of the stuff we use for the 
                    drama club. I thought it might make you 
                    feel... well...

      She pulls a wig out of her desk. It's brown and a little It 
      tattered. Emily looks at it.

                                  EMILY
                    I'm not sure.                                  JILL
                    Oh, go on and try it.

                                  EMILY
                    How do you put it -

                                  JILL
                    Here, like this. That's it. No, more around 
                    this way...

                                  EMILY
                    Oww, wait...that hurts. Here...

      She bends her head down and fidgets with it a moment, then 
      rises up. The wig is askew and doesn't really fit her head.

                                  EMILY
                    What do you think?

                                  JILL
                    Well...
                            (starting to giggle)

                                  MARS (O.S.)
                    I think it's hysterical

      Emily looks toward the door where a bunch of the kids have 
      started coming in. They all shriek with LAUGHTER as they 
      see her. Emily is mortified. She looks at Jill, who can't 
      suppress her own GIGGLE.

      Emily's eyes well with angry tears. She pulls the wig off 
      and throws it in Jill's face - then runs out the back door.

      EXT. THE EDGE OF SLAGTOWN - DAY - OFFICER PUENTE

                                  PUENTE
                    Here! Over here!

      Sikes & George and a few others come to her, peer down into 
      some rubble. Burns joins them. Puente is very nervous.

                                  PUENTE
                    What the hell by that?

      Sikes & George move slowly down closer to what appears to 
      be part of a leg - but hollow. George uses a stick to lift 
      aside some trash paper revealing      THE SKIN OF A NEWCOMER

      Dried out, husk-like, as if it has been SHED like a 
      snakeskin. He indicates a MOIST TRAIL that stretches away.

                                  SIKES
                    Look at that... It looks like something 
                    came outta the skin and dragged itself 
                    away. ...What the hell happened 
                    here? ...George?

      George seems mesmerized. Sikes is getting edgy.

                                  SIKES
                    George? This looks like some kinda damned 
                      metamorphosis! What's going on? George!?

                                  GEORGE
                    I... don't know what to say. I've never 
                    seen... anything...

                                  SIKES
                    You haven't? You haven't!? Look at that 
                    Skin! It's one of you! or it was. What was 
                    inside of it, George?

                                  GEORGE
                    I don't know, Matt, I-

                                  SIKES
                            (grabbing his arm)
                    Level with me, dammit! What was inside of 
                    it? Is it inside all the Newcomers?

      George is silent. Sikes is suddenly chilled. Speaks low...

                                  SIKES
                    Good God... Is the same thing inside of 
                    you?
                          (no answer)
                    Is it?!

                                  GEORGE
                            (very quietly)
                    ...How could it be?                                  SIKES
                    I don't knows You tell me, dammit!

                                  GEORGE
                    Matt...

                                  SIKES
                            (exploding)
                    Tell me, you damned slag, or I'll-

      He's shaking George violently, but George stares at him, 
      stoically. Sikes snarls, shoves him down and storms off. 
      Burns is CLICKING OFF some shots of the shed skin.

      INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - SUSAN'S MAKESHIFT ART ROOM - NIGHT

      Susan has sculpted the face of the pissy Homeowner woman 
      she encountered earlier. It's an excellent likeness. Susan 
      looks at it a moment, then PUNCHES her fist hard into it. 
      Now she feels better.

      George has entered through the back door. Susan is still 
      looking at the bust, she doesn't see that George is darkly 
        preoccupied.

                                  SUSAN
                    Hi, honey... Listen, we've gotta talk. Emmy 
                    had a real rough day and Buck's school 
                    called. ...He's never been there.

      George stops. Looks at her. Flares, heads out of the 
      kitchen.

                                  SUSAN
                    George. Wait. I want us to do it together. 
                    George!

      INT. BUCK'S ROOM - BUCK

      is thrumming on his instrument, making an interesting 
      rhythm, when George steamrolls in fiercely and grabs him - 
      scaring the living shit out of him.

                                  BUCK
                    What!! What, dad!! wait!!

      George SLAMS him up against the walls Bellows at him -                                  GEORGE
                    - Listen you little ingrate slag, I've 
                    worked my ass off so you can have a better 
                    life and won't have to live like a damn 
                    slave - and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let 
                    you piss away your Chances! I catch you 
                    ditching any more school - or catch you 
                    running with those smartass hoods, I'll 
                    have your head in a buckets - Got that?! 
                    You GOT THAT!?

                                  BUCK
                            (mumbling angrily)
                      ...Yeah... yeah...

      George slings him to the floor and stands glowering. Buck 
      starts to say something. Stops.

                                  GEORGE
                            (snapping)
                    What.

                                  BUCK
                    You don't want to hear it.

                                  GEORGE
                    You got something to say, say it.

                                  BUCK
                    I think you're just roasting me cause of 
                    the crap you eat at your job.

                                  GEORGE
                            (bristling)
                    I'm roasting you cause you're turning into 
                    a little screw-up slag who's ditching 
                    school-

                                  BUCK
                    - And because crap rolls downhill.

      George is furious. He raises his hand to hit Buck.

                                  BUCK
                    Go on - but just remember, man, I didn't 
                    like amp you to move here! 
                                  (MORE)                                  BUCK (CONT'D)
                    I didn't ask ya t'sell your soul t'the 
                    terts.

      They stare at each other angrily. Finally George just 
      chuckles bitterly. Shakes his head. ...And leaves.

      INT. AN APARTMENT - NIGHT - A TELEPHONE

      is RINGING. A hand picks it up. It is Burns.

                                  BURNS
                    Yeah, hello?

                                    A MAN'S VOICE
                    This Burns?

                                  BURNS
                    Yeah.

                                  THE MAN'S VOICE
                    I seen it.

                                  BURNS
                    Seen what? Who is this?

                                  THE MAN'S VOICE
                    I seen the thing that come outta the skin.

                                  BURNS
                            (antenna up now)
                    Where?

                                  THE MAN'S VOICE
                    You pay me?

                                  BURNS
                    Yeah. If it really is something.

                                  THE MAN'S VOICE
                    Oh... it's somethin' alright. ...But you 
                    better hurry.

                                  BURNS
                    Where are you?                                  THE MAN'S VOICE
                    413 east washington. Alley by the liquor 
                    store. Better hurry.

      The phone goes dead. Burns stares at it. Hangs up. Runs 
      off.


 


                                         ACT FIVE


      EXT. A GRITTY STREET BORDERING SLAGTOWN - NIGHT

      Burns hurries across the wet pavement toward a liquor store 
      which also has a display of brand name sour milk in the 
      window. Then he catches sight of a man waving to him from 
      the shadows. He looks a bit healthier than the average 
      street person.

                                  BURNS
                    You the guy who called?

                                  THE INFORMANT
                    Yeah.

                                  BURNS
                    Where is it?

                                  THE INFORMANT
                    Let's see some bread, man.

                                  BURNS
                    Take me to it first.

                                  THE INFORMANT
                    No bread, no bug, baby.

                                  BURNS
                    Alright, here.
                            (handing some cash)

                                  THE INFORMANT
                    Get serious. Worth more than -

                                  BURNS
                    After I get a shot of it.

                                  THE INFORMANT
                            (weighs it, then)
                    Awright, awright... Down here.

      He shuffles down the dark alley. Burns follows, nervously 
      readying his camera.      INT. SIKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT - SIKES

      has a cup of tea and Tuggs' files spread before him. He's 
      squinting at a particular file with the handwritten title, 
      "Newcomers - Slaves from Deep Space." He mumbles Tuggs' 
      words.

                                  SIKES
                    "And from two of them I have heard a word 
                    that sounds like..." What the hell is that 
                    word? "...'Kleeze-antz-un' - but so far 
                    I've been unable to get a meaningful 
                      translation. It seems to be a word that 
                    they deny knowledge of - or that frightens 
                    them."

      Sikes looks up with a thoughtful frown.

      INT. CATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - HER TELEPHONE

      is ringing in the dark apartment. She's just coming in when 
      her answering machine picks up.

                                    CATHY'S VOICE

                    me again.}

      She hangs up the phone. Stares at it. Then a KNOCK at her 
      door startles her. she moves to it, warily

                                  CATHY
                    Who's there?

                    Me. Sikes.

      She opens the door. He's got Tuggs' file in his hands.

                                  SIKES
                    Got a sec?

                                  CATHY
                    Sure.

      He eyes her a minute. Wondering if her skin might come off.

                                  CATHY
                    What is it?

                                  SIKES
                            (shows her the file)
                    Uhh... what does this word mean? "Kleeze-

                    My partner was working on this before he 
                    got killed. Always interested in slavery. 
                    Used t'say he was gonna write a book 
                    someday. Guess he started talking t'some of 
                    you about being slaves.
                            (flipping pages)
                    He couldn't understand why you all were 
                    so... here it is... "One of the most 
                    curious aspects of Newcomers slavery was 
                    their apparent submissiveness."

                    We just were. Since then I've often 
                    wondered myself. I can't imagine being that

      EXT. THE ALLEY NEAR SLAGTOWN - NIGHT - BURNS & THE 
      INFORMANT

      Make their way down a ragged hillside. The L.A. skyline can 
      be seen in the b.g., but the f.g. is very unsettling: a 
      dump with abandoned cars, ratty furniture, and a large 
      concrete tunnel, spattered with graffiti, which disappears 
      into the ominous darkness of the hillside. The Informant 
      points.

                                  BURNS
                    In there?

                                  THE INFORMANT
                    Yeah. Musta gone back in. I seen it around 
                    the outside. Draggin' So something.

                                  BURNS
                    What?

                                  THE INFORMANT
                    I dunno. Mighta been a body.

                                  BURNS
                    How long ago?

                                  THE INFORMANT
                    Just before I -

      With a FEARSOME SHRIEK - THE CREATURE is upon them!      The action and cutting are frenetic Giving only 
        IMPRESSIONISTIC GLIMPSES as Burns and The Informant try to 
      fend off the beast! It is definitely INSECT-LIKE and taller 
      that they are! It slashes at them with frightening, 
        pincher-like claws on the ends of two long, and two shorter 
      arms!

      What we glimpse of the body is black, part husk-like, part 
      bristling, and shiny with slime!

      Burns tries to bring his camera up, but it is knocked away. 
      The Creature's horrific face rears up in the shadows over 
      Burns. Before he can get a good look, a spray of liquid 
      causes his clothes to smoke and smolder. It's acid!

      He yelps and scrambles to one side, clutching his hand and 
      leg which have also been ravaged by the acid. He hears 
      SCREAMS:

                                  THE INFORMANT
                    No! Help me! For God's Sakes

      Burns looks back, dazed, and sees The Informant being 
      dragged off quickly toward the tunnel by the thick-legged 
      beast.

                                  BURNS
                    Help! Somebody! HELP!

      Burns struggles against his pain, grabs his camera, and 
      fires off a few flash photos just before The Creature 
      disappears into the darkness and The Informant's cries are 
      drowned in a hideous gurgle!

      Burns lies on the filthy ground, breathing hard, panicked.

      EXT. AN AUTO SALVAGE YARD - DAY - A NEWCOMER MANAGER

                    on us now? What a loada crap. There it is.

      He points toward a dark station wagon. There are a series 
      of two-inch holes blown out down the side of it.

                                  THE MANAGER
                    Poor guy... what was his name?

                    Yeah. Never had a chance. Lookit them 
                    holes.

      George walks slowly along beside the car. Touching the 
      holes. There is dried blood around the last one.

                                  THE MANAGER
                    That's where he bought it. You're lucky 
                    it's still here. Order came down to scrap 
                    it a week ago. I just been too busy.

                    Would you?

      The man nods and walks away. George looks more closely at 
      the last hole - then notices a much smaller hole nearby it. 
      He inspects it carefully - reacting to something unusual.

      EXT. EMILY'S SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY - MARK

      in his wheelchair, and two other boys are Suppressing 
      giggles as they approach Emily who is eating by herself and 
      reading. Just as they get up to her, one of the boys whips       out a can of BUG SPRAY and sends a cloud of it at Emily.

                                  MARK

      The other boys shout out in mock terror, "Raid! Oh Not 
      Argghh! etc." grab at their throats and fall "dead" across 
      the table.

      Emily closes her book. Gets up almost regally, and leaves 
      them convulsed with LAUGHTER behind her. Jill is coming 
      toward her with a tray full of lunch.

                                  JILL
                    Hey, Em, I was just -

                                  EMILY
                    Why don't you go play with your friends.

                                  JILL
                    Hey, c'mon, I -

      But Emily's gone. Jill stares after her. Turns gruffly.

                                  JILL
                    Fine. Forget it.

                            (hanging up his phone)
                    'Nother report of slag-bashing.

                                  GEORGE
                            (walking in)

                    What can I tell ya, man.

                                  GEORGE
                    You can tell me it's "an assault."

      George looks away, blinking. Sikes gives him a prissy look 
      behind his back. Albert approaches, with some old clothes.                                  ALBERT
                    Lt. S-Sikes? ...These what y'had in mind?

                    Yeah... perfect. Try that on.

      He throws an old raincoat at George, who grits his teeth 
      and BLINKS several times.

                                  GEORGE
                    What is this for?

                    happens when you're constipated!

      George finally blows. Grabs Sikes by the collar, angrily 
      pulls him up face to face. Everyone around them reacts.

                                  GEORGE
                    Whey we're constipated we go into 
                      cataleptic fits! We usually grab the 
                    nearest human - particularly if he's 
                    smartass cop - and throw him out a window.

      Sikes tries to shake free, but George tightens his grip and       LIFTS SIKES off the floor!

                                  GEORGE
                    - I can't help being a Newcomer any more 
                    than Yam can help having a skull full of 
                    manure. So let's try to overlook each 
                    other's peculiarities, shall we?

      He throws Sikes back down into his chair. Before Sikes can 
      decide how to react, George throws an envelope into his 
      lap.

                                  SIKES
                    What the hell is this?

                    I found it inside the car Tuggs was hiding 
                    behind.

      In the envelope is a long, narrow bullet.

                                  SIKES
                    What?

                                  GEORGE
                    It came from in front, not behind. I think 
                    it's what killed him.
                            (leaning closer)
                    Too bad they weren't aiming at you.

      He turns on his heel and leaves Sikes behind. Stunned.

      EXT/INT. BROREN-DOWN WAREHOUSE (FROM SCENE 1) - LATE DAY

      Buck and his gang are bringing in more stolen furniture.                                  SVABO
                    {Yeah, this's great man! Just like home!}

                                  BLENTU
                    {Better'n home.}

                                  BUCK
                    {Damn straight.}

      Suddenly part of a wall crashes down, revealing EIGHT BLACK 
      YOUTHS. Tough-looking and dangerous.

                                  THE BLACK LEADER
                    You picked the wrong place to hunker, 
                    slags!

      And they erupt at Buck's gang, one has a C02 extinguisher! 
      It's spray incapacitates one of the Newcomers.

                                  THE BLACK LEADER
                    How 'bout a little salt water, dude!?

      He squirts it right in Svabo's face! Svabo yelps as the 
      water burns and smokes on his skin like acid!

      Buck dives onto the black leader. The fighting is furious - 
      hand to hand - and the blacks quickly realize they may have 
      underestimated the Newcomers' prodigious strength.

      Svabo throws one through a window.

      Blentu fights his way through the C02, grabs his opponent 
      throat. Slugs him mercilessly.

      Another black kid dives on Buck, knocking him down into the 
      area where The Vagrant had been in scene one. Buck gets 
      some of the SLIME on his jacket.

      The blacks pound him, but Buck's fury is no match for them. 
      He hurls the one away, bouncing him off a wall. During the 
      struggle, a real PISTOL falls from one kid's pocket. Buck 
      looks up to see the leader pull out a pistol of his own - 
      and FIRE a SHOT at Buck.

      Buck scrambles across the floor, scoops up the fallen 
      pistol as another BULLET RICOCHETS near him. He rolls over 
      and FIRES - hitting the leader in the stomachs The youth 
      drops, gasping.      Buck stares - amazed and frightened. The others have 
      reacted to the shot - startled! The blacks break off the 
      fight, panicky, two rush to their leader, SHOUTING EPITHETS 
      at the Newcomers. There are distant SIRENS approaching.

                                  SVABO
                    Out! Get him out or we'll kill you all!

      The blacks retreat, carrying their badly wounded comrade. 
      The Newcomer gang is jubilant around Buck.

                                  BLENTU
                    (Great shot, Finiksa!}

                                  SVABO
                    {Yeah! You see that sucker fold up! Boom?!}

                                  BLENTU
                    {I think you killed him, man! That'll teach 
                    'em!}

      The SIRENS are closer.

                                  SVABO
                    {C'mon, let's dust it.}

      They start to run off, look back at Buck who's frozen in 
      place, pulse racing, breathing hard, staring.

                                  BLENTU
                    {Finiksa! C'mon, man!}

      Buck comes into the moment. Pockets the gun. Runs with 
      them.

      INT. SIKES' APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT - A NEWCOMER

      moves to Cathy's door. Knocks gently. She opens it. Is 
      surprised to see the Newcomer surgeon, RAMNA. Her first 
      instinct is to close the door in his face.

                                  RAMNA
                    Jelana, please, I assure you it's a matter 
                    of great importance or I never would've 
                    come. Please put the past behind us.

      A beat. Cathy is very reluctant.                                  RAMNA
                    It's truly a matter of life and death... 
                    most probably death.

      She stares - just as Sikes comes out of his door - dressed 
      in the old ratty clothes. By explanation he winks, says:

                                  SIKES
                    Late date.

      Cathy forces a little smile, preoccupied with Ramna, whom 
      she admits and closes the door.

      INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - GEORGE, SUSAN & EMILY

                                  GEORGE
                    Maybe the girl... Jill... was trying to 
                    help you before, Em. When she gave you the 
                    wig.

                                  EMILY
                    But then she laughed with the rest of them, 
                    daddy.

                                  GEORGE
                    And that hurts, I know. I feel badly at 
                    work sometimes... get angrier than I 
                    should... It's... going to take a little 
                    time, Em... But it'll -

      Susan gets up abruptly. Walks out. George keeps focused.

                                  GEORGE
                    - It'll change. You'll see. ...You have 
                    much homework?

                                  EMILY
                    A little. About Indians.

                                  GEORGE
                    Oh - I'd like to hear about that. I'll be 
                    right back, okay?

      INT. THEIR LAUNDRY ROOM - SUSAN

      is loading the washer. Tight-lipped. The back door opens 
      and Buck enters. Wired. Overly cheerful. Even Kisses her.                                  BUCK
                    Hey, mom. How's it going

                                  SUSAN
                    ...About like usual. Give me that jacket, 
                    you've got something all over it.

      He strips it off. A bit of the SLIME brushes onto Susan's 
      arm, but she ignores it as George enters.

                                  GEORGE
                    Sus...

                                  BUCK
                    Hey, pops. Be down in a minute.

      He exits. George glances after him, curious about Buck's 
      upbeat attitude. Then looks at his wife.

                                  GEORGE
                    Sus, we've really both got to -

                                  SUSAN
                    It's hard for me sometimes at S.C., but at 
                    least I'm older.

                                  GEORGE
                    Does everyone treat you badly?

                                  SUSAN
                    Of course not. And the ones who do I can 
                    deal with. But Emmy's only nine, I can't 
                    stand it when people hurt her. I hate it, 
                    George. I hate it!

                                  GEORGE
                    So do I, Sus. But we -

      THEIR LIVING ROOM WINDOW

      is SHATTERED as a rock CRASHES through its - Emily screams:

                                  EMILY
                    Momma!! MOMMA!

      George and Susan rush in. Susan pulls Emily into a doorway.                                  SUSAN
                    Em! Emmy!? Are you okay!?

                                  BUCK
                            (running in)
                    What happened?!

      George has run to look out the window. He sees

      A PICK UP TRUCK IN THE STREET - INTERCUT

      peeling away with a few men, including a couple of blacks, 
      on the back. Shouting "Dirty slags!" - "Damn BUG people!" - 
      "Go back to Slagtown!" - "Get the hell out!" - "We're gonna 
      exterminate ya!" - George and Buck watch them speed away.

                                  SUSAN
                    Do you see! Do you SEE, dammit!

                                  GEORGE
                    Sus -

                                  SUSAN
                    NO! DON'T START! It's not worth it, George! 
                    Nothing's worth this! I don't want my 
                    children to go through this anymore, do you 
                    hear me!? I want to go back. I'd rather 
                    live in that Slagtown hovel for the rest of 
                    my life-

                                  GEORGE
                    And how about the rest of their lives? And 
                    their children's lives?

                                  SUSAN
                    It's not worth it, George. Not to me.
                            (exiting with Emily)
                    ...Not for my kids.

      George stares after her. Then looks back at Buck, who 
      stands in the middle of the shattered glass, feeling the 
      weight of the rock in his hand - and looking off into the 
      night.                                        ACT SIX

      INT. CAPTAIN GRAZER'S OFFICE - DAY - SIKES

      is entering. Grazer looks up.

                                  GRAZER
                    Hey Sikes, have fun playin' homeless last

                                  SIKES
                    Almost as much fun as bein' a captain.

                                  GRAZER
                    Hey. I'm sorry they promoted me and not 
                    you, okay? You and George see any bugs last 
                    night?

                                  SIKES
                    No. And I was out on my own. He had a 
                    problem at home.

                                  GRAZER
                    Sounded like you two had a problem here 
                      yesterday. That what this is about?

                                  SIKES
                    No. ...I want an autopsy on Tuggs.

                                  GRAZER
                    What? He's dead and buried.

                                  SIKES
                    They never did an autopsy.

                                  GRAZER
                    C'mon, you saw him. So did I.

      He reaches into a box and extracts a thin cigar.

      cigar.                                  GRAZER
                    What's an autopsy gonna show?

                                  SIKES
                    ...Can I order one?

      Grazer eyes him, rolls the cigar between his fingers...

                                  GRAZER
                    ...Sure.

      INT. EMILY'S SCHOOL - MAIN OFFICE - DAY - SUSAN

      enters stiffly, aware that she's the only Newcomer in the 
      room.

                                  SUSAN
                    I'd like to see the principal.

                                  THE RECEPTIONIST
                            (smiling)
                    You must be Emily's mother.

                                  SUSAN
                    How'd you guess.

                                  THE RECEPTIONIST
                    Oh, we all know which one She 
                    is. ...Y'know, I'd just like to tell you 
                    that my husband works with a couple of your 
                    kind down at that post office. And they're 
                    real polite. They're just fine.

                                  SUSAN
                    I'm so glad.

      The BLACK TEACHER moves through the b.g., overhearing.

                                  THE RECEPTIONIST
                    Can I tell Ms. Stevens what you want to see 
                    her about?

                                  SUSAN
                      Withdrawing my daughter.                                  THE RECEPTIONIST
                    Oh. I'm sorry t'hear that. Well, she's in a 
                    meeting right now. If you'd like to wait -

                                  SUSAN
                    Yes. Where's the women's room?

      INT. THE WOMEN'S ROOM - SUSAN

      is rinsing off her face, looking at her tired eyes. The 
      Black Teacher enters, washes her hands, CHUCKLES. Susan 
      looks at her.

                                  THE BLACK TEACHER
                    Just thinking about when there used t'be 
                    three kinds of restrooms.

                                  SUSAN
                    Three?

                                  THE BLACK TEACHER
                    Men, Women, ..and Colored.

                                  SUSAN
                      ...Really?

                                  THE BLACK TEACHER
                    I'm old enough to have aped 'em. ...Things 
                    change, though. They do change. If you want 
                    'em to badly enough. I remember this old 
                    black woman, Miss Jane Pittman. She used to 
                    pass this particular water fountain every 
                    day. The White Folks' water fountain. Then 
                    one day, y'know what she did? She went 
                    right up to it and took a drink.
                            (smiling)
                    Lord, but didn't all hell break loose. 
                    "Nigger drunk outta the white fountain! 
                    Nigger done this, nigger done that!" - One 
                    of 'em became the mayor of Los Angeles. One 
                    of 'em's the mayor of Atlanta. Atlanta! One 
                    of 'em ran for President. ...One of 'em 
                    will be President someday.
                            (she smiles, sighs)
                    Hard to take that first drink, though. 
                    Takes a lot of courage to be like old Miss 
                                  (MORE)                                  THE BLACK TEACHER (CONT'D)
                    Jane.

      A pause. Susan looks at her for a long moment, but finally 
      looks away.

                                  SUSAN
                    ...At least they weren't afraid she'd turn 
                    into an insect.

                                  THE BLACK TEACHER
                          (a chuckle)
                    Honey, I can show you people who still 
                    think black people have rabbit blood - and 
                    that Jews have horns.
                            (giving her a pat)
                    You don't look like a cockroach t'me.

      Their eyes meet again. The woman smiles and leaves. Susan 
      stands alone. And then she looks at herself in the mirror.

      EXT. A SEEDY STREET - NIGHT - A POSTER

      says, "Vote YES on 16" - but has a big "NO" sprayed on it. 
      Sikes & George, DRESSED AS VAGRANTS, shuffle around a 
      corner. George is blinking less, but he and Sikes are still 
      restrained.

                                  SIKES
                    Who?

                                  GEORGE
                    The guy Tuggs pulled out of the car just 
                    before he got killed.

                                  SIKES
                    You talked to him?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes. Said he couldn't swear to it, but he 
                    thought he did hear a gunshot come from in 
                    front of Tuggs.

      Sikes looks at him. George keeps looking forward, checking 
      out the streets and alleys, while Sikes reviews...                                  SIKES
                    Alright. So Tuggs is doing this research on 
                    why you all were such submissive slaves, 
                    hears about these Overseers who may have 
                    been in charge of you, gets the address of 
                    a plant owned by a underworld type-

                                  GEORGE
                    Which smelled like the inside of our 
                      spacecraft...

                                  SIKES
                    Right. And somebody kills him - but makes 
                    it look like he died in action.

                                  GEORGE
                    Maybe. Did they exhume his body?

                                  SIKES
                    Yeah. Autopsy's tonight. Let's check down 
                    this alley.

                                  GEORGE
                    There's nothing down there.

                                  SIKES
                    It's pitch black, how - You see as well as 
                    you smell, huh?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes. How 'bout over there?

      Sikes nods. They cross toward another dark street.

      INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - EMILY

      lies in bed reading "David Copperfield." She hears a TAP at 
      her window. Frowns. Moves to it. Sees Jill outside. Opens 
      it.

                                  EMILY
                    What're you -

                                  JILL
                    My mom went out to one of her stupid Purist 
                    meetings. I want to say I'm sorry. ...

                    I really am.

                                  EMILY
                    You made me put that wig on just so they 
                    all could laugh at me. That wasn't very 
                    nice.

                                  JILL
                    No, really! I thought it might make you 
                    feel better. More like one of us, you know? 
                    It just didn't work.

                                  EMILY
                            (agreeing)
                    Yeah, it was a dumb idea. I can't be 
                    something I'm not.

                                  JILL
                    Well anyway, I just wanted you to know I 
                    felt bad.

                                  EMILY
                    Thanks.

                                  JILL
                    My mom doesn't want me to play with you.

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah, okay.

      She reaches to close the window. Jill stops her.

                                  JILL
                    But I want to. We could play at your house, 
                    or in the park. She wouldn't have to know, 
                    if you want.

      Emily smiles.

                    Good. So who sent down the order to have 
                    the car scrapped? "Captain" Grazer?

                                  GEORGE
                    No. A man named Donald Wilks.
                            (off Sikes' reaction)
                    I take it you know him.

                                  SIKES
                    Yeah. ...He's the assistant D.A.

      For the first time tonight they really LOOK at each other. 
      Then George looks off sharply, SNIFFING the air.

                                  SIKES
                    What?

                                  GEORGE
                    Formic acid.

      They both react. George indicates a direction.

      A NEARBY FACTORY AREA - GEORGE & SIKES

      peer warily through industrial equipment. Their eyes widen.

      THEIR POV - INTERCUT

      glimpsed through the shadows is The Creature! Sikes 
      whispers:

                                  SIKES
                    Holy...! Look at that thing!

                                  GEORGE
                            (into a two-way)
                    This is 13, we've got a target in the 
                    factory yard, 1200 Alameda. Request Air 
                    Ten.

                                  SIKES
                    C'mon - we're gonna lose it.                                  GEORGE
                    ...Like hell.

      George takes the lead, skirting in the shadows.

      They catch another glimpse of The Creature, moving through 
      a broken door into the factory.

      They edge warily along the side. Find a panel in the metal 
      wall which is bent out. Without looking back, George slides 
      through and inside.

      THE FACTORY

      which is damp, dark. Rusting heavy-duty chains and pulleys 
      hang from the darkness above. George moves carefully. Sikes 
      close behind, gun drawn, tense. They whisper...

                                  GEORGE
                    Where'd it go?

                                  SIKES
                    Beats the hell outta me.

      From outside comes the sound of an approaching helicopter - 
      and suddenly it's white-hot ARC LIGHT knifes in through the 
      overhead windows, cutting sharp streaks through the gloom - 
      and revealing the silhouette of The Creature - on a large 
      generator right behind and above them! It reacts! Sikes 
      spins!

                                  SIKES
                    There!!

      He squeezes off three SHOTS as The Creature SHRIEKS and 
      lands on top of him - simultaneously knocking George into a 
      shallow concrete pit.

      The helicopter roars outside. The blazing, moving streaks 
      from its arc light provide bizarre illumination against the 
      stark blackness as Sikes struggles in the grasp of the 
      beast's four arms!

      George is scrambling to get out of the pit!

      Sikes sees an ugly sphincter in The Creature's neck 
      articulate and he can guess what's coming - he shoves his 
      arm in front of it, just as the acid spews out - deflecting       it from his face, but getting it on his hand! He shouts 
      with pain! Fights harder, digging his hand into The 
      Creature's bristling back!

      George gets up to the edge of the pit, tries to get a clear 
      shot - but is fearful of hitting Sikes. Finally he aims 
      lower and FIRES two shots, hitting The Creature in the leg!

      It SCREECHES and drops Sikes - skitters clumsily into the 
      darkness. George rushes to him.

                                  GEORGE
                    Acid?!

                                  SIKES
                    On my left hand! Ahhg!

      George whips out a plastic bag of white powder and pours it 
      over Sikes wounded hand.

                                  GEORGE
                    Alkali, it'll cut the acid and - What?

      He sees that Sikes is looking at something clutched in his 
      good right hand. Sikes is amazed...

                                  SIKES
                    ...Son of a bitch.

                                  GEORGE
                    Is that a piece of it?!

      Sikes leaps to his feet, furiously running after The 
      Creature.

                                  GEORGE
                    Matt? Matt!?

                            (bellowing)
                    - It's Velcro!

                                  GEORGE
                    - What!?

      THE CREATURE

      is scrambling through the darkness. Sikes leaps on it's       back!

                                  SIKES
                    You son of a bitch!

      He digs his hands into The Creature's bristling back and 
      RIPS it apart - revealing the back of the MAN inside!

      George rushes to help, and together they strong-arm the 
      "Creature" to the floor, pulling the heavy costume back 
      revealing the huge brute within - who still struggles - 
      until George presses his gun against the brute's neck.

                                  GEORGE
                    Stop fighting or die.

      Potent words. Resistance ceases. Sikes pulls harder on the 
      costume, revealing ANOTHER MAN, very small and thin, inside 
      the costume in front of the brute - providing the second 
      pair of arms.

      Sikes & George share a glance of amazement - then hear:

                                    A MAN'S VOICE
                            (urgent whisper)

                                  THE BRUTE
                    Over here!

      Two men move forward through the shadows.

                                  THE MAN'S VOICE
                    What the hell happened? Are you-

                                  GEORGE
                    Hands on your heads. You're under arrest.

      They start to run. George FIRES in the air.

                                  GEORGE
                    DID you hear me?!

      The men stop. Comply.                                  GEORGE
                    Walk this way.

      They come slowly into the light. One of them is The 
      Informant whom Burns thought had been killed. The other 
      is... The Purist Leader. Sikes & George glance at each 
      other. Sikes blows out an incredulous PUFF, and George goes 
      back to work...

                                  GEORGE
                    You have the right to remain silent...

                    Daddee! Hi, it's your number one daughter. 
                    Listen, I've really been missing you. So 
                    let's have dinner Saturday, can we, huh? 
                    Can we? I'd like you to meet this really

      peers in. It's uncharacteristically NEAT. Something's 
      wrong. He reaches for his gun, but has taken it off. Then A 
      MAN in a three piece, pin stripe suit comes out of the 
      bedroom.

                      ...Lieutenant... Lieutenant..?

      Sikes eyes open slightly, dazedly, as though drugged.

      SIKES' SUBJECTIVE POV - HAZY, DISORIENTED

      Agent Randall is leaning over. Someone else, a big NEWCOMER 
      hovers in the b.g., taking a hypodermic from Randall, whose 
      voice echo's throughout.

                                    RANDALL
                    That's it... here I am... can you hear

                    ...Good. Very good... Now I want you to 
                    tell me something, Lieutenant... And you 
                    want to tell me, don't you...?
                            (off Sikes' bleary nod)
                    That's very good...Just tell me what you 
                    know about ...The Overseers...

      Sikes blinks heavily. Struggles to think. Finally shakes 
      his head slightly.

                                    RANDALL
                    Surely you must know something.

      Sikes shakes his head again. The Newcomer in the b.g. is 
      annoyed, angry. Randall eases him back.                                    RANDALL
                    If he knew anything, he'd talk. This is 
                    powerful stuff.
                          (to Sikes)
                    ...Are you sure, lieutenant?
                            (off Sikes reaction)
                    Alright then, just go back to sleep... 
                    that's right... and when you wake up you 
                    won't remember this little conversation, 
                    will you? ...You won't remember...

      Sikes' eyes drift closed again. He sleeps. Fitfully.

      INT. A JAIL CELL - NIGHT - TITO

      the Latino whom Sikes & George busted earlier, is lying in 
      the shadows on his bunk, gasping. His breathing is pained, 
      he rolls over into a beam of light - which reveals the UGLY 
      SORES which have spread over his face and neck. He GROANS

                    And since the discovery that the insect-
                    like creature was merely a hoax concocted 
                    by radical Purists, the opinion polls have 
                    swung back the other way - showing about

                      yesterday. His condition worsened during 
                    the night, and he has been placed on the 
                    critical list. Authorities are still 
                    looking for his assailant, believed to be a

      George is fixing his tie in the mirror. Her voice reflects 
      a new, more centered fortitude.

                    He pauses. Smiles.

                                  SUSAN
                    You're smiling, aren't you?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes.

                                  SUSAN
                    Well, I might change my mind again 
                    tomorrow, so don't press me, okay?

                                  GEORGE

                    You must be pretty pleased with yourself, 
                    after last night.

                                  GEORGE
                    It was rewarding, yes. Just to know that 
                    that creature was only a fiction and there 
                    was nothing seriously - biologically - 
                    wrong.

                                  SUSAN
                    Well, I'm proud of you.

      She gives him a little HUM on the neck. He smiles, exits. 
      Susan spreads on some lotion - and notices a small red RASH 
      on her arm. Touches it quizzically. Shrugs it off.

      EXT. A PARK PLAYGROUND - DAY - EMILY & JILL

                    I can't believe it. I'm really embarrassed.

      REVERSE - A CAR

      containing Jill's Mother - and the Purist Woman who was

                    I'll put a stop to it right now.

      She starts to open the car door, but the Woman restrains 
      her.

                    No, no, no... let them play.

                            (confused)
                    What?

                                  THE WOMAN
                    This little friendship is something we can 
                      definitely use to our advantage.

      Jill's Mother looks at the woman curiously. The woman keeps 
      focused on the two little girls, and smiles enigmatically.

      Sikes nods, heads off. Dobbs returns to paperwork, sipping 
      coffee from a Styrofoam cup. Albert approaches tentatively.

                                  ALBERT
                    Sc-Scuse me, ...Sergeant Dobbs?

                    here...

      He holds out Dobbs' personalized mug, which he has 
        meticulously reconstructed and glued together. Dobbs 
      blinks.                                  ALBERT
                    There's st-still a few chips. I c-couldn't 
                    find 'em all, but -

      Dobbs is turning the mug over in his hands. Genuinely 
      touched by Albert's effort.

                                  DOBBS
                    ...It's fine, y'did a nice job.

                                  DOBBS
                    Yeah. Lookit.

      He puts the mug on his desk and pours his coffee into it.

                                  DOBBS
                    Good as new. ...Thanks a lot.

                    You're w-welcome. And I'll try t'be m-more 
                    careful.

      Dobbs smiles at him and nods. Albert walks away. Dobbs 
      starts to lift the mug - but the handle BREAKS OFF in his 
      hand. He mumbles in annoyance -

                                  DOBBS
                    Aw, dammit. Hey, Albert!

      Albert turns to look back, with a gentle smile.

                                  ALBERT
                    Yes, s-sergeant?

      Dobbs looks at Albert's childlike, hopeful face... A beat. 
      Then Dobbs HIDES the broken piece in his palm.

                                  DOBBS
                    ...Thanks again, man.

                                  ALBERT
                            (beaming)
                    You're w-welcome. ...Man.

      Albert walks away - on air. His day is made. Probably his       whole week. Dobbs watches him. Reflectively.

                          (a beat)
                      ...Y'understand? ...Sikes?

      Sikes stares at him. Nods slowly. Exits.

      THE STATION OFFICE - SIKES

      walks slowly and thoughtfully back to his desk. Looks up to 
      see

                                  GEORGE
                    What?

                                  SIKES
                    What d'you know about the BNA?

                                  GEORGE
                            (shrugs)
                    Their phone number?                                  SIKES
                    Dial it.

      George does. Hands the phone to Sikes.

                                  SIKES
                    Hello?... Hi... Agent Randall please...
                            (glances at George, mumbles)
                    Hey, look. I'm sorry I called ya a slag, 
                    huh?

      George weighs it. Nods acceptance of the apology.

                                  GEORGE
                    Sorry about the manure line.

      Sikes shrugs. Then listens on the phone.

                                  SIKES
                      Yeah...I'm here.
                            (nods, hangs up)

                                  GEORGE
                    ...They have no Agent Randall.

                    ...Right. ...What a surprise.

      A beat. George hands him a piece of paper.

                                  GEORGE
                    The autopsy report on Tuggs.

                    "In addition to the major wound sustained 
                    through the back there was...
                          (a glance at George)
                    "...There was another, much smaller

                                  GEORGE

                            (looking up)
                    That's what the SWAT teams use.

                                  GEORGE
                            (nodding, quietly)
                    Be may have been assassinated by a police 
                    weapon.

      Sikes glances at George, then off toward

      CAPTAIN GRAZER'S GLASS-PARTITIONED OFFICE - INTERCUT

      Grazer has been looking at Sikes, but now looks away. Puffs 
      his thin cigar.

      Sikes ponders it all for a long moment.

                                  SIKES
                    What have we got here, George old 
                    boy? ...What have we got?

                                  GEORGE
                    Honestly, Matt? ...Beats the hell outta me.

      Sikes looks up at George. Their eyes hold.
