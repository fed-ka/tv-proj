The view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous, ornate house
is extraordinary.
A small outdoor dinner party is in progress.
A MAGICIAN is entertaining guests.
Playing cards and coins
appear and disappear in his nimble hands.
Edward comes out of the house.
Jags, a limo with waiting
DRIVER and two BMW's pack the circular driveway behind a black
Ferrari.
The limo driver leaps to attention at the sight of
Edward.
Edward stands, making an obvious effort to keep his
impatience under control.
Stuckey comes out of the house and
down the walk.
STUCKEY
What's up, where you going?
EDWARD
Give me your car keys, will you,
I'm going back to my hotel.
STUCKEY
At least stay for a drink.
This
party's for you.
EDWARD
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Stuckey gropes uncertainly in his pocket for keys.
STUCKEY
Listen, there're some major local
talent inside just dying to meet
you...
EDWARD
(as if delighted)
Really?
Some high class gold
digger who speaks French better
than I do?
(turning away)
No, thank you.
I just got off
the phone with one.
STUCKEY
Cynthia's not coming?
EDWARD
No.
Edward grabs the keys out of Stuckey's hand.
He crosses to a
black Ferrari and gets in.
STUCKEY
Let your driver take you.
We'll
move the cars...
Edward starts the car.
STUCKEY
Can you drive a stick?
The car lurches forward with a squeal of wheels and promptly
stalls.
STUCKEY
Edward, give me a break!
With a squeal of tires, the Ferrari bucks out of the driveway
and... stalls again.
EDWARD
Love this car!
Is it new?
STUCKEY
Yes!
And you don't even know
where you're going!
Edward starts it again and heads uncertainly uphill.
Stuckey
watching, throws up his hands.
STUCKEY
That's the wrong way!
CREDITS BEGIN AS IN A SERIES OF CROSSCUTS:
The Ferrari, moving fast through the Hollywood Hills, passes
large, beautiful homes... Edward shifts, grinding gears...
The Ferrari comes to a red light and pulls up next to a Dodge Colt.
The GIRL in the Colt looks at Edward and his car admiringly.
Edward feeling confident now, revs the engine.
The light turns
green.
Edward immediately stalls the Ferrari.
The Colt leaves
him in the dust.
The Ferrari comes to the intersection of OUTPOST and FRANKLIN,
stops.
Edward gets out of the car.
He looks at the street
signs.
He has no idea where he is.
He signs.
He gets back
in the car and takes off on Franklin heading East.
A crumbling old apartment building.
Dark alley ways, deserted
parking lot.
The Ferrari -- blink and you miss it -- motors past the building,
looking very out of place on the street.
PANNING UP
A building facade of lit windows and metal fire
escape.
One window in particular.
A GIRL stands there in a
short kimono, looking down.
And then she turns away.
Vivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk.
She hurried
away.
Vivian walks along, urgently looking for something... someone.
A BABBLING STREET-TYPE goes by happily talking to himself.
He wears an "I Love Hollywood" t-shirt.
Vivian passes TOURISTS but doesn't notice them any more than
she pays attention to the VAGRANT she passes further on, huddle
in a doorway.
A LONG-HAIRED KID on a SKATEBOARD goes by dropping off little
bags to various STREET-TYPES.
A BARKER-TYPE stands in front of a photo store urging tourists
to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut-out of a movie
star.
Some go in.
Vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking JAPANESE TOURISTS.
A BLACK PROSTITUTE in a mini skirt strolls toward her.
A car
passes.
The DRIVER stares at Vivian with interest.
She ignores
him.
The black prostitute approaches the car.
PROSTITUTE
Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?
The Driver looks her over.
The Black Prostitute gets in the
car and it drives away.
A GROUP OF MEN, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night
coffee shop.
They WHISTLE and make obscene gestures and SOUNDS
as Vivian hurries by.
She ignores them and goes next door into
a falafel stand.
Half a dozen PEOPLE sit at dirty tables inside.
Skateboard zips by a GROUP.
We SEE a police car parked at the
entrance to an alcove.
Also, an ambulance.
The bubblegum
lights are going.
A CROWD has gathered.
The happy man with
the "I Love Hollywood" t-shirt and a POLICE OFFICER are engaged
in tense conversation.
COP
They just pulled her out of a
dumpster in the back.
Now talk
to me.
MAN
I tell you, man, I don't know who
she hang with.
COP
She have a pimp?
MAN
Cocaine her pimp, man.
She a
strawberry.
She be out on these
streets, day in, day out, tradin'
her sorry ass for crack.
And
now she dead from it.
Vivian rushes up to join the outskirts of the crowd as the body
of a YOUNG GIRL is pulled out of an open dumpster and carried
towards the waiting ambulance.
For a moment Vivian thinks
it's... no, Vivian turns grimly away.
Vivian surveys the dark street.
And suddenly sees who's she's
looking for.
Walks.
We SEE a young, tough-looking MAN and WOMAN trying on wigs.
The STOREKEEPER is a man wearing a dress and wild wig.
The
girl, KIT, is around 18, is dark haired and thin.
The young
man, CARLOS, has his arm sloppily draped across Kit's shoulder.
They giggle about something, both obviously high.
Kit looks
up, bleary-eyed.
She stops.
Vivian is standing in front of
her.
VIVIAN
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
KIT
Hi, Viv.
Carlos, you know my
roommate, Viv.
CARLOS
Lookin' good, baby.
VIVIAN
(ignoring him)
Did you blow it all, Kit?
Is it
all gone?
KIT
Carlos had some great rock.
VIVIAN
I bet.
(beat)
That was our rent!
Carlos attempts to put an arm around Vivian's shoulders.
CARLOS
Calm down, Chica.
Vivian throws him off.
CARLOS
Ey!
What is it you wan', baby?
I can fix you up.
VIVIAN
Beat it, scum bucket!
CARLOS
You kiss your mother with that
mouth?
Your frien' still owes
me 200.
VIVIAN
(to Kit)
Let's go.
Skateboard appears suddenly, blocking Vivian and Kit's path.
VIVIAN
Get out of my face or I'll have
those cops on your ass in two
seconds.
Carlos glares at her.
He looks down toward the lights of the
cop cars.
One of the POLICEMEN looks towards them, curiously.
Vivian waves at the cop.
CARLOS
(threatening to Vivian)
Don't take no dates tonight,
chica, you got one with me.
Vivian grabs Kit by the arm and pulls her across the Boulevard.
Edward's Ferrari turns onto Hollywood Blvd., finally out of
the Hollywood Hills.
Vivian and Kit are out trying to hustle John's in passing cars.
Vivian strikes a sexy pose at the bus stop.
Kit is talking to
another prostitute, RACHEL.
KIT
No no, honey.
You see these
stars on the sidewalk.
Me and
Vivian work from Don Ameche all
the way up to Roy Rogers.
This is our office.
We got
seniority.
Get off our corner.
RACHEL
I was just taking a rest here.
Besides, she's new.
(points to Vivian)
KIT
But I'm old.
Go rest up by Monty
Hall or Debra Paget where you
belong.
Rachel walks off.
VIVIAN
(looks at passing cars)
Looks slow tonight.
KIT
Maybe we should get a pimp.
Carlos likes you and --
VIVIAN
Forget it.
We work for it.
We
keep it.
They keep hustling.
KIT
I can't handle this tonight.
I'm going home.
VIVIAN
(stares at her)
That crack is burning a hole in
your pocket.
There isn't even
milk in the fridge.
The rent's
due.
Now come on --
KIT (O.S.)
(suddenly)
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
VIVIAN
He's not gonna want us.
The Ferrari goes by and stops.
EDWARD
(calls out to Vivian)
Excuse me.
KIT
(excited)
Don't take less than a hundred.
You look hot tonight.
And
remember, don't mouth off.
They
don't like that.
VIVIAN
Okay.
Go home.
But take it easy
on that shit.
Kit gives Vivian a quick hug.
KIT
You're the greatest.
I'll wait
up for you.
And then Kit is off, moving quickly away.
Vivian turns.
She
stares at the Ferrari, loathing it and all it represents.
And
then it's as if Vivian turns a switch.
She fluffs her mane of
hair, throws her shoulders back, thrusting her breasts out and
sashays towards the car, a sexy, friendly smile on her face.
In the driver's seat of the Ferrari, Edward is looking furious
and distracted.
Vivian leans over the passenger window.
VIVIAN
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
EDWARD
What's that?
VIVIAN
You looking' for some company?
EDWARD
Uh, no.
How do I get to Beverly
Hills?
VIVIAN
What?
(dropping the come on)
You gonna tell me you're lost?
EDWARD
Yes.
VIVIAN
Great.
What do I look like a
tourguide?
Edward takes a good look at her.
EDWARD
(a beat)
No, you look like a hooker.
VIVIAN
Actually, I'm a movie star out
for a walk.
EDWARD
Good.
Can you tell me how to
get to Beverly Hills?
VIVIAN
Sure.
For five bucks.
EDWARD
That's ridiculous.
VIVIAN
The price just went up to ten.
EDWARD
Why don't you just do it out of
the kindness of your heart?
VIVIAN
(sweetly)
Sit... and spin.
EDWARD
Sit-and-spin.
(amused)
Alright... why not?
He pulls out his money clip.
Vivian suddenly freezes.
On the sidewalk up ahead, Carlos and
Skateboard.
Carlos flashes an evil, menacing grin.
He motions
to Skateboard, they start forward.
EDWARD
(holding up a bill)
You have change for a twenty.
Vivian pulls open the door of the car and jumps in.
VIVIAN
For twenty, Ill show you
personal.
Drive.
Edward stares at her.
She smiles sweetly.
VIVIAN (cont'd)
Make a "U-ee".
Beverly Hills
is the other way.
The Ferrari pulls away, passing Carlos on the sidewalk.
The Ferrari glides along a seedy, West Hollywood section of
Santa Monica.
The Ferrari peels out, fishtails madly and SCREAMS up the
street.
Thousands of tiny white lights sparkle along the walls of the
Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
Bright flags are illuminated
by carefully placed spotlights.
The Ferrari SCREAMS into the
driveway and comes to a jarring stop by the front door.
The sun is coming up as HOTEL EMPLOYEE hoses down the sidewalk
in front of the hotel.
Vivian is looking wide-eyed and delighted and yes, more than
a bit overwhelmed.
She passes store windows... and MORE STORE
WINDOWS... and still MORE STORE WINDOWS.
Each display is more
beautiful and expensive than the one before.
Vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks.
From
PASSERBY'S.
Two beautiful dressed GIRLS her own age look at
her, turn away and giggle.
The uniformed GUARDS that stand at
attention in front of many of the stores, stare at her
suspiciously.
Feeling more and more uncomfortable, Vivian comes to a posh
woman's boutique.
She hesitates for a moment.
She enters.
Vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost.
She takes
a deep breath, trying to control herself.
Two WOMEN, in elegant
designer outfits, stroll by, eyeing Vivian as if she were a
freak.
Vivian suddenly feels naked.
She turns and hurries
away.
A sleek corporate helicopter flies over the port.
Edward, Vance, Stuckey and Jake walk toward the building's
edge.
They look out over the empty shipyard as Vance describes
it.
VANCE
Okay... this is the jewel in
Kross's crown.
We can strip out
all the heavy equipment.
Some
of the cranes are very valuable
overseas.
The Japanese are
salivating for them.
STUCKEY
Prime industrial property
straddling the Port of Long Beach
and Los Angeles.
It gives me a
hard-on.
Edward points toward one of the edges of the shipyard.
EDWARD
What's that long building over
there?
JAKE
Storage, I think.
EDWARD
Not with those smokestacks it's
not.
VANCE
Let me check.
Vance pulls out a notebook.
JAKE
The real estate possibilities
are endless.
Most of the yard
we'll just level.
I talked to
a couple of developers, under the
table, of course, and they said
--
EDWARD
You what?
JAKE
I talked to some developers about
the land.
STUCKEY
What kind of an idiot are you?
You don't talk about this to
anyone.
JAKE
They're close friends, they'd
never breathe a word --
STUCKEY
(to Vance)
Where did you dig this moron up?
VANCE
He's right, Jake, that was an
incredibly stupid thing to do.
It won't happen again, Edward.
I'll pull him off the project
immediately.
EDWARD
Don't bother.
STUCKEY
What!?
EDWARD
We don't have the time to bring
someone new up to speed.
Besides...
(not unkindly, to Jake)
You've already impressed everyone
you need to, haven't you?
JAKE
It won't happen again, Mr. Harris.
Vance has found what he was looking for in his notebook.
VANCE
This is interesting.
That
building is storage now, but it
used to be a smelting plant.
They
closed it down after World War
II.
EDWARD
I want our lawyers to check into
the toxic waste licences on them
right away.
I want to know if the
permits are still valid and what
kind of limits are on them.
STUCKEY
Jesus, yes.
It's a long shot but
if the permits are still in
effect, they're worth a fortune.
He turns away.
The other follow Edward back toward the
stairs.
EDWARD
What time's diner tonight?
STUCKEY
Eight o'clock.
Kross is bringing
his son.
Very bright kid, watch
yourself with him.
Who's this
girl you're taking?
EDWARD
No one you know.
Vivian walks along Rodeo Drive.
She looks lovely in the pink
dress and new, white shoes.
A pretty, white hat is the final
touch.
She carries a bag containing her old clothes.
She stops
at a trashcan and ceremonially throws the offending items away.
Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags.
She
feels like she owns the block.
A well-dressed MAN passes by,
smiling politely.
Vivian's nose lifts as she happily ignores
him.
Suddenly Vivian stops.
She's about to pass the shop she was
thrown out of.
Vivian takes a breath and enters the shop.
PANNING BELLIES
People are sunbathing by the pool.
Overweight... lobster red... old and stretch-marked... fishy
white... and then gorgeous.
The gorgeous is Vivian.
She is
wearing a miniscule bikini and sunglasses.
WAITER (O.S.)
Miss Vivian?
She looks up.
A young WAITER, looking a little dry-mouthed at
the sight of her, is holding a telephone.
WAITER
You have a call.
Mr. Harris.
VIVIAN
(taking the phone)
Hi, baby.
(a moment)
I'll be ready.
Bye.
She hangs up.
She looks at the Waiter, confused.
VIVIAN
What do you wear to polo?
Horses and riders crash and careen on the playing field.
An
enthusiastic crowd cheers.
DOWN OFF THE EDGE OF THE FIELD
a tailgate party using Cadillacs and Rolls Royces is in
progress.
Horses and riders thunder by a crowd of very
well-dressed, successful-looking people -- celebrities, execs,
socialites, aficionados -- most of whom ignore the game.
They
are there to see and be seen much more than to watch a polo
match.
Vivian and Edward make their way towards the party.
Edward is
wearing his new tie.
Vivian is looking very chic and beautiful
in one of her new outfits.
Not that it's helping -- the place,
the people, the wealth -- everything here suddenly has her
overwhelmed.
She suddenly stops.
VIVIAN
You're really pushing it,
bringing me here.
EDWARD
I think it's exciting.
VIVIAN
What id we run into someone I
know?
EDWARD
I really doubt anyone here
frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
VIVIAN
You did.
A VOICE calls out.
STUCKEY (O.S.)
Edward!
They turn.
William Stuckey is with a group of people.
He waves
them over.
STUCKEY (cont'd)
Come on!
Over here!
Edward takes Vivian's arm and leads her forward.
Stuckey grins and shakes Edward's hand.
STUCKEY
(looking at Vivian)
Well, well, well...
Vivian dislikes this guy on sight.
Dislikes the frosty looking
woman at his side.
EDWARD
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
STUCKEY
(holding out a hand;
smiling)
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.
My wife,
Elizabeth.
VIVIAN
Hi.
Elizabeth Stuckey stretches her thin lips in a cold smile.
STUCKEY
Lots of fun people here.
Let me
get you two some champagne.
He moves quickly away.
ELIZABETH STUCKEY
Excuse me.
She moves to greet someone else.
Vivian and Edward survey the
milling CROWD.
VIVIAN
(sarcastic)
Real genuine guy.
EDWARD
He's good at what he does.
VIVIAN
You could freeze ice on his wife's
ass.
She anything like your ex?
EDWARD
(a small smile)
Shall we mingle?
A goal is scored.
IN A SERIES OF CUTS
Edward watches and guides her, Vivian sips champagne and meets
and chats and wins over different PEOPLE.
A group of PEOPLE.
WOMAN
I simply love your dress, Vivian.
VIVIAN
This old thing?
WOMAN
Of course, a figure like yours
can wear anything.
You must work
out constantly.
VIVIAN
I lead a very physical life.
OLDER MAN
Are you into running, Vivian?
VIVIAN
I'm into walking.
I walk a lot.
In another group of PEOPLE.
ANOTHER MAN
You look awfully familiar, Vivian.
Haven't we run into one another
at the spa in La Costa?
VIVIAN
Well, I do often spa there.
Edward and Elizabeth Stuckey watch Vivian laugh and chat with
a group of WOMEN.
ELIZABETH STUCKEY
Edward, she's marvelous.
Warm
and witty and down to earth.
EDWARD
(with pleasure)
She is, isn't she.
ELIZABETH STUCKEY
So unlike your usuals.
Where on
earth did you find her?
Edward smiles enigmatically.
Taking an hors d'oeuvres off a
passing WAITERS's tray, he starts forward.
A WOMAN
We're good together.
He has to
admit it.
I've been just what
he wants me to be.
I say the
right things, I know the right
people, I give wonderful parties.
No question, no arguments, no
embarrassments.
It works for both
of us.
That makes Vivian think.
And then she smiles as she sees Edward
approaching.
Vivian moves to him.
VIVIAN
Edward, these women here, I don't
think any of'm like the guys
they're with.
They're just into
it for the money.
EDWARD
I'm sure that's true for some of
them.
VIVIAN
I thought I was the pro.
These
women make me feel like an
amateur.
EDWARD
(a beat)
Ready to stomp sod?
IN A SERIES OF SHOTS TO MUSIC
The CROWD engages in sod stomping.
They drink champagne.
They
make a dance out of it.
They laugh.
Shoes get stuck in the
mud.
It's ludicrous -- these people in their suits and fancy
clothes, replacing divots and stepping over the horse shit.
In a corner of the field, grazing horses stare, seemingly in
disbelief.
Vivian is having a wonderful time.
And then, as she moves
towards the outside of the crowd she sees someone staring at
her from over among some of the riders and grazing horses.
David Kross smiles at Vivian.
She hesitates... and then she
crosses towards him.
DAVID KROSS
Hi.
VIVIAN
Hi.
I never thought stomping
in grass could be so much fun.
DAVID
(laughs)
I like your hat.
VIVIAN
Huh?
Oh... yeah.
S'okay?
(pleased; a moment)
Uhm... how're... business things
going.
DAVID
Let's not talk about it, it's too
depressing.
Come on, I'll show
you Thunder.
VIVIAN
Please, we hardly know each other.
DAVID
Thunder's a horse.
Come on.
They approach the sweating mount.
David Kross caresses the
horses muzzle.
DAVID
Hey, big guy, you getting tired,
yet?
I am.
This is Vivian.
(a beat; and then:)
You two been together long?
You
and Edward?
VIVIAN
No.
DAVID
Hope to be?
To Vivian's surprise, the question causes a pang inside.
VIVIAN
It's... it's not like that.
DAVID
I see.
Well.
Maybe that means
you'd have lunch with me sometime
then.
Vivian is suddenly silent.
She looks away.
DAVID (cont'd)
I'm sorry, am I being too forward?
VIVIAN
You don't know anything about me.
DAVID
I'd like to find out.
You don't
know anything about me either.
That's why people have lunch.
But something holds Vivian back, a feeling.
William Stuckey turns... stops... stares.
He sees Vivian and
David Kross standing together.
He stares, his mind racing, and
anxious, angry look on his face.
Stuckey has Edward off to the side.
He is talking to him in
a low, earnest voice.
STUCKEY
Fill me in on this.
How'd you
and Vivian meet?
EDWARD
We just did.
STUCKEY
(grinning)
Come on, you can tell me.
I sure
would like to know where a guy
runs into a girl as attractive
as this.
EDWARD
The night I left your house, I
was lost.
I was looking for
directions.
STUCKEY
And you just happened to run into
her.
Great.
What's she do?
She
work?
EDWARD
Yes...
STUCKEY
Doing what?
EDWARD
Vivian's in sales.
STUCKEY
Sales, really?
That's great.
What does she sell?
Edward's eyes narrow.
EDWARD
Why do you want to know?
STUCKEY
Hear me out.
I've known you a
long time.
I see a difference
in you this week.
Like that tie.
I'm suddenly wondering if this
girl's not the difference.
Especially when I see her talking
with David Kross.
Vivian turns away from the bar, now holding two glasses of
champagne.
She scans the crowd for Edward.
EDWARD
She met him at dinner last
night... I like this tie.
STUCKEY
So now they're best friends?
Edward, this girl appears out of
nowhere and now I see her talking
to a guy whose company we're
trying to buy.
It's too
convenient.
EDWARD
You're being ridiculous.
STUCKEY
Industrial espionage is not
ridiculous.
Edward, how do you
know she hasn't attached herself
to you so she can bring Kross back
information?
EDWARD
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy,
she's a hooker.
I picked her up
off Hollywood Boulevard.
as she hear loud sudden LAUGHTER.
She turns.
She sees that
it's Stuckey laughing.
Smiling, Vivian starts towards them with
two glasses of champagne.
STUCKEY
I swear to God, you are the only
millionaire I ever heard of who'd
go looking for a goddam bargain
streetwalker!
Edward sees Vivian coming.
EDWARD
Let's drop it, shall we?
Edward turns.
He smiles gently as Vivian quietly approaches
and hands him his glass of champagne.
A group of BUSINESSMEN are standing a short distance away.
One of them calls out:
MAN
Edward!
May we have your opinion
on something?
EDWARD
(to Vivian and Stuckey)
Excuse me a moment.
He moves to join the group of men.
Stuckey gives Vivian a
broad smile.
STUCKEY
Having a good time, Vivian?
VIVIAN
Yeah.
Thanks.
STUCKEY
All this must be quite a change
from Hollywood Boulevard.
Vivian looks as if she's been struck.
VIVIAN
What?
STUCKEY
It's okay.
Edward told me.
Your
secret's safe with me.
Stuckey runs his hand up her arm.
STUCKEY (cont'd)
What do you charge, Vivian?
Maybe you and I could get together
after Edward leaves.
VIVIAN
(forcing a bitter smile)
Yeah.
Sure.
Why not.
Call me
at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
STUCKEY
I just might do that.
He moves away.
Vivian turns.
Edward looks up from his
conversation, sees her looking at him.
He smiles, raises his
glass in a small toast.
A moment.
Vivian toasts him back.
Edward exits out of his limo and walks to the front doors.
The corporate jet takes off down the landing strip.
The setting sun casts an incredibly glow over the city and the
coast.
VIVIAN (O.S.)
You ever been in love with
anyone?
An airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the San Francisco
Opera House.
The DRIVER walks around back and opens the
passenger door.
Edward emerges and helps Vivian out.
The plane flies in the night.
Back to L.A.
Vivian stands at the railing, unhappily looking out at the city
beyond.
The phone RINGS.
She turns and hurries inside.
Edward comes out of the building.
His Chauffeur leaps to open
the limo door.
EDWARD
No... take the car back to the
hotel.
I need to walk.
He sets off across Century Park East.
A long silver limo drives down Hollywood Blvd.
The limo pulls to a stop in front of a rundown apartment
building on a dirty Hollywood side street.
The Limo Driver,
a large Latino man, steps out of the car and walks around to
the passenger door.
As he does, he surveys the surroundings
uncomfortably.
Ths is rough neighborhood.
He opens the door.
Vivian steps out.
LIMO DRIVER
Maybe I should go with you.
This
doesn't look like a good place
for a lady to be alone.
Several PEOPLE pass.
All of them stare at the car, at the
driver, at Vivian in her lovely clothes.
VIVIAN
I'll be okay.
I'm home.
Thank
you.
The driver, confused, watches her hurry up the steps to the
apartment building.
He drives off.
Kit enters the falafel stand on Hollywood Boulevard.
Edward is still talking to the prostitutes.
EDWARD
I'm looking for a girl, Vivian,
young, dark hair, big eyes...?
They shake their heads.
EDWARD
She's mouthy.
Sort of
difficult...?
PROSTITUTE 1
Ain't seen her, wouldn't know
her.
PROSTITUTE 2
What's wrong with us, man?
Two
for the price a one, what ya say?
EDWARD
(disappointed)
Thank you.
No.
They turn and walk away.
Edward stands there, not knowing
what to do next.
He looks discouraged and lost.
KIT (O.S.)
Edward Harris, as I live and
breathe!
Edward quickly turns to find Kit staring at him.
Kit smiles,
triumphantly.
KIT (cont'd)
Yeah.
Boy, you're just like she
said.
She turns and starts away.
She stops, turns back.
KIT (cont'd)
You comin' or not?
I don't got
all day, I got a grilled cheese
waitin'.
Edward follows Kit.
Vivian comes out onto the fire escape.
She stares in wonder.
A snow white limo comes up the street.
A necktie has been tied
to the antennae like a knight's token.
The MUSIC from La Boheme
is BLARING from the car's stereo.
Edward is standing on the
car's seat, his head and body up through the open sunroof.
The
wind blows at his hair.
He is smiling.
Everywhere on the street people are staring; the BUMS, the
PUSHERS, the PASSERBY'S, the TOURISTS.
Vivian doesn't know whether to laugh or cry.
The car comes to a stop in front of the Vivian's building.
Vivian's landlord comes out the front door.
His eyes go wide
in disbelief.
Edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the
sunroof.
He leaps nimbly to the ground.
He crosses to the entrance
of the alleyway, looking up at Vivian on the fire escape.
VIVIAN
You are really lost this time.
Edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her.
With a sudden cry of joy, Vivian comes down the fire escape.
She stops at the bottom stair.
Edward comes forward and sweeps
her into his arms.
They kiss.
He carries her to the limo as if she's weightless.
Her feet
never touch the ground.
The car door closes behind them.
The limo drives away.
The people of the street watch it go.
