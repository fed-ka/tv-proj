ELLIS(14) sits fully-clothed on top of his made bed. He is a
wiry young man with a few blonde hairs on his upper lip
struggling desperately to be a mustache.
His room, cluttered with junk, is dark, quiet and tiny. A
backpack and an oversized Walkie-Talkie sit next to him.
The silence is cut by a SQUAWK from the Walkie. Ellis
quickly grabs it.
ELLIS
I'm comin' out now.
He crams the Walkie into his backpack and slings it over his
shoulder. On his feet, he slides open a window at the foot
of his bed. He's out in one motion.
MARY LEE(41) takes a jug of milk out of the refrigerator.
SENIOR(52) sits at a small table reading a newspaper. The
mobile home kitchenette is no larger than Ellis' room.
MARY LEE
I just want to have a conversation.
I just want to talk about it.
Mary Lee sits down across from Senior, who doesn't look up
from his paper. Her eyes narrow and she extends a finger
toward him.
MARY LEE (CONT'D)
If you don't look up from that
goddamn paper...
She stops before completing the thought.
After a moment, Senior lowers his paper. He stares across
the table at his wife. He looks at her with true disdain.
2.
His eyes trace down her face and robe before finally settling
on his cup of coffee. He picks up the cup, takes a sip, and
sets it back on the table. He raises the paper up.
Mary Lee's eyes soften. She bites the inside of her cheek to
keep from crying. Her eyes move to the kitchen window.
Ellis, stooping over, makes his way into the tiny cabin room.
Yellow floral curtains, stained with age, cover a row of
windows that wrap around the top of the cabin. These provide
an odd glow in an otherwise dark, wood paneled space.
There is a bench with rotted out cushions to the left. To
the right, a mold-covered sink and mirror.
Neckbone peers over Ellis' shoulder at the front of the cabin
room. A small booth sits to the right across from a
miniature toilet partially shielded by an open door.
NECKBONE
It's got its own shitbox
Neckbone slides back a portion of floral curtain and light
streams in. He starts opening small closets and drawers.
Ellis plops down on the rotted bench cushions.
ELLIS
This is perfect.
NECKBONE
Ho-Lee-Shit.
Neckbone stares in an open drawer. He removes a stack of
Playboys from the 1980's.
Ellis smiles at him. He leans back and props his foot
against the sink cabinet across from him. This is home.
Neckbone opens the first Playboy. It disintegrates.
NECKBONE (CONT'D)
Aw shit.
7.
As he scrambles to gather the fallen pages, Ellis notices a
dried BOOT PRINT next to his foot. He lowers his shoe from
the cabinet leaving a smaller, muddy print of his own.
He leans in to examine the larger print. The impression of a
CROSS has been left in the heel.
NECKBONE (CONT'D)
Her tits are so small.
Ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the
cross marking. His eyes narrow as he re-surveys the cabin.
On the table across from the toilet, he notices several empty
cans of Beanie Weenie. In the booth, he sees a grocery bag.
Ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it.
ELLIS
Neck.
NECKBONE
Look at that beave. You gotta see
this.
Ellis reaches out for the plastic bag. His fingers pull back
the edges to reveal its contents: one can of unopened Beanie
Weenie and half a loaf of BREAD.
ELLIS
Neck.
Ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze. It's
FRESH. Ellis freezes.
NECKBONE
What?
ELLIS
Someone's here.
NECKBONE
What?
Ellis holds the loaf of bread up to Neckbone.
ELLIS
Someone's livin' here.
Neckbone sees the grocery bag. His eyes widen. The boys are
stone frozen. They listen for other sounds. Silence.
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
Both boys flinch at the sharp sounds. Neckbone's hand flies
to cover the alarm on his wristwatch.
8.
NECKBONE
Shit.
ELLIS
We gotta go. I can't be late.
The trailer is decorated in the filth of a true bachelor pad.
Neckbone makes his way to a bedroom. He tosses clothes and
trash around to get to what he's looking for. A cardboard
box. He pulls the box onto the bed and sifts through.
NECKBONE
I don't want you goin' back out
there by yourself. That river's
scary enough with two people, and I
don't trust that guy.
(FINDS SOMETHING)
Here it is.
He takes out a hardback book. The slip reads, "The Confident
Confidant, communicating with the opposite sex."
NECKBONE (CONT'D)
Galen said this really turned
things around for him.
ELLIS
Thanks.
Ellis flips delicately through the manual.
Mary Lee flinches when she sees Ellis come through the door.
Her face is flushed. Senior stands toe to toe with her.
They stare at Ellis, who has paused in the doorway. He
doesn't say anything, just looks curiously at his parents.
Senior storms past Ellis and is out the door.
Ellis steps further into the den. Mary Lee tries to
straighten herself, patting down her hair and dabbing at her
eyes with the back of her hand.
ELLIS
You okay momma?
MARY LEE
Yes.
21.
She walks into the kitchen keeping Ellis at her back. She
turns on the sink and begins scrubbing at a dish.
MARY LEE (CONT'D)
Do you need me to fix you
somethin'? Have you eaten?
ELLIS
I'm all right.
Mary Lee shuts off the water and lets the dish rest in the
sink. She turns to Ellis.
MARY LEE
I'm gonna turn in.
ELLIS
Okay momma.
Mary Lee slips past him and enters her bedroom. The door
closes and Ellis is left alone in the den. It's quiet. He
waits, looking at the door his mother just closed.
Ellis walks into the kitchen and eases open a cabinet door.
Checking over his shoulder, he zips his backpack open and
fills it with CANNED FOOD.
A switch clicks "ON". BLINDING LIGHT emits from two FLOOD
LAMPS encased in plastic shells. The switch clicks "OFF" and
the lights dim to the dull orange glow of their filaments.
GALEN
They look bright enough.
The owner of the shop, an ELECTRICIAN(62), holds up a metal
bar with the lamps affixed by bolts at either end.
ELECTRICIAN
Should be. I rigged DC power up
through marine batteries. Makes it
portable. Gave you a rigging bar
to set on your shoulder.
28.
GALEN
So you really think these'll work
under water?
ELECTRICIAN
In theory.
Ellis walks past the grocery aisles looking for the girl. He
spots her by the potato chips. He tucks behind a display of
stacked cans and watches.
Juniper reaches for a bag of chips, birds tattooed on her
hand. Ellis smiles. It's her, and she really is beautiful.
She turns down the aisle, coming right for him. He pretends
to peruse the canned food and notices that it's a big display
of Beanie Weenie. He grabs two handfuls as she passes.
Ellis takes the cans to an open register. As a CASHIER scans
and bags his items, he cranes his neck looking for her.
She's disappeared into another section of the store.
Ellis pays in crumpled cash. A horn HONKS. He sees Galen's
truck idling out front. He grabs the bag and runs out.
Mary Lee sits hunched at the made dinner table. She runs her
finger around the rim of a half empty glass of iced tea.
It's a full spread with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and a
salad. The table is set for two. She's been waiting.
Ellis lets the front door slam shut behind him. She sits up.
MARY LEE
You're late.
Ellis doesn't speak, he doesn't look at her. He enters his
room and shuts the door.
He's heard the news and she knows it. Mary Lee's face drops.
Ellis slings his backpack down, pacing the small room. He
stops and leans his forehead against the door. The sound of
his Mother clearing the table seeps through.
He kicks the door, cracking its shitty composite wood. His
face flushed and his breathing heavy, he slides to a seat.
On the verge of hyperventilating, he stares out the dark
bedroom window trying to get control of his breathing.
Ellis looks at his backpack. It has spilled open revealing a
can of Beanie Weenie. Ellis studies the can.
He looks back to the window. His breathing settles.
Quickly, he scoops up the backpack and heads out the window.
Mary Lee knocks on her way into the bedroom.
MARY LEE
Time to get up.
She begins picking clothes off the floor. Ellis, in bed,
raises up on his elbows. He's tired from a late night.
ELLIS
It's Saturday.
MARY LEE
I'm going to Wal-Mart. I need you
to come with me.
ELLIS
(MOANING)
Mom.
MARY LEE
Come on.
She pulls the covers off of him.
47 I/E. MARY LEE'S CAR/INTERSTATE - DAY 47
The two ride in an awkward silence.
40.
Ellis stares at the farmland passing by outside as Mary Lee
steers the compact Toyota down a four-lane interstate.
MARY LEE
Ellis I know what your father told
you last night. That's not what I
wanted. I wanted to sit you down
and talk about it.
ELLIS
What do you wanna talk about? You
want to leave and that means they
can tear up our house.
MARY LEE
I've spent my whole life on that
boat. I don't think it's too much
to ask for your...
Mary Lee is interrupted by a line of traffic backed up in
front of her. She slows to a stop.
MARY LEE (CONT'D)
Oh no. I hope no one's hurt.
There are flashing police lights up ahead. Ellis tries to
see what's going on but can't make anything out past the line
of cars. They inch forward.
MARY LEE (CONT'D)
I'm just saying there are two sides
to this. I haven't made up my mind
about anything because I want you
to be involved in my decision, but
I need a change Ellis. I deserve
one.
As they approach the flashing lights, they see three State
Trooper vehicles parked to funnel traffic down to one lane.
The STATE TROOPERS stop each car, checking the trunks.
MARY LEE (CONT'D)
I think they're searching people.
A Trooper signals Mary Lee to pull up to a stop. Two other
Troopers approach her vehicle. The first begins looking in
her back windows as the second leans down to speak to her.
She lowers her window.
TROOPER
Can you open the trunk please
ma'am?
MARY LEE
Of course.
41.
Mary Lee pulls the lever by her knee, and the second Trooper
walks around the back of the car.
TROOPER
Have you picked up or seen any
hitchhikers today ma'am?
MARY LEE
No sir.
The Trooper produces a flier with a color photo on it.
TROOPER
Have you seen this man?
MARY LEE
No sir.
The Trooper leans over and holds the paper out to Ellis.
TROOPER
Son, have you seen this man?
Ellis looks at the photo. It's of Mud. He looks exactly the
same as he did last night, down to the shirt. In the photo,
Mud's smiling, revealing his missing tooth.
ELLIS
No.
TROOPER
We've had reports that he's in this
area. If you see him, call 9-1-1
immediately.
MARY LEE
We will officer.
The Trooper pulls his head from the window.
ELLIS
What'd he do?!
The Trooper bends back down and looks at Ellis.
ELLIS (CONT'D)
(MORE CALM)
What'd he do?
TROOPER
Move along please.
Mary Lee pulls forward and speeds back up on the interstate.
MARY LEE
My lord.
(rolls up her window)
(MORE)
42.
MARY LEE (CONT'D)
How would you feel about moving
into town with me?
(NO ANSWER)
Please don't tell your father this,
but I've been looking at a couple
of places. I know it would be a
big adjustment for you, but it
might end up being something you
like. You know living on the river
isn't exactly everyone's idea of
the good life. Ellis?
He looks at her.
MARY LEE (CONT'D)
Are you even listening to me?
Ellis busts through the door, grabs his backpack and is gone.
CARVER (O.S.)
KEEP LYIN'! KEEP LYIN' AND I'LL
CRACK YOUR NOSE OPEN!
The door opens to CARVER(47), a tall, slender man in a dark
Western cut suit, standing over Juniper. She's crumpled up
in a ball at the end of the bed. Carver swats open-handed at
her head. Grabs the top of her hair.
CARVER (CONT'D)
You hear me bitch? Tell me another
lie.
Ellis rushes Carver with his shoulder as if he were breaking
down a door. Carver is knocked off balance. He trips over
the edge of the bed and crashes into the motel room wall.
Carver, slightly stunned, gets to his feet and in two broad
steps lands a man-sized punch across Ellis' face. It's hard.
Ellis melts. He grabs the boy up by the scruff of his shirt.
CARVER (CONT'D)
Who are you!? Who the hell are
you!? Did he send you!?
Carver removes a piece of paper from his pocket. It's a
photo copied picture of Mud, different than the State
Trooper's. Carver crams the photo in the boy's face.
CARVER (CONT'D)
You know this man!? Look at him!
Do you know him!?
Blood trickles from a cut under Ellis' eye. He stutters
under the shaking force of Carver's hands.
ELLIS
I don't...I...
NECKBONE (O.S.)
FISH!!! IT'S FISH!!!
57.
Neckbone is yelling at the top of his lungs, almost in a
girl's pitch. Carver turns to him. The cooler is open
behind them and Neckbone holds up two Ziplock bags of fish.
NECKBONE (CONT'D)
We're just selling fish!
Carver sizes things up. It takes a moment, but he settles.
He snorts out a laugh and drops Ellis on the ground.
Carver turns his attention back to Juniper, who is huddled up
in the corner of the motel. Carver walks over to her.
Opening a good-sized knife, he gets down in her face and
holds the blade uncomfortably close to her cheek.
CARVER
I know you know where he is. And I
swear to God I'll cut through every
one a you to find him.
She flinches. Standing, Carver folds up his knife.
CARVER (CONT'D)
We know you came here for him, and
we know he's too stupid to leave
you behind. So when he pops his
head out of whatever shithole he's
staying in, I'll be there. You
tell him that.
Carver turns, stepping over Ellis on his way out.
CARVER (CONT'D)
And you need to mind your business
boy.
Neckbone moves from the doorway to let him pass. Carver is
gone. Neckbone shuts the door and fastens the security
latch. He kneels down to check on his friend.
NECKBONE
You all right?
ELLIS
Yeah.
NECKBONE
He popped your eye.
Ellis holds the back of his hand up to his eye which has
begun to swell. The cut trickles blood over his cheekbone.
Juniper moves to the sink. Ellis sits up, staring at her
back.
58.
She opens an ice bucket and wraps a handful of cubes in a
towel. She turns and walks over to them, her eyes cast down.
She kneels in front of Ellis, making eye contact for the
first time. She touches his chin, gently pivoting it to see
the wound. Her eyes are glassy.
JUNIPER
Thank you.
He stares back at her. He can't take his eyes off her. She
holds the iced towel to his cheek. He doesn't even flinch.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
I'm so sorry.
Tears form and run down her cheeks.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
Here.
She takes his hand and places it against the towel. She gets
to her feet and pulls a pocket book from a bag in the corner.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
How much is your fish? I'll buy
the cooler full.
Ellis motions Neckbone to the cooler. Neckbone goes over and
crams his hand into the ice. He removes a Ziplock bag
containing the note that Mud sent.
Neckbone hands it to Ellis. Taking the note, he sets his ice
down and walks over to Juniper.
ELLIS
Mud sent us to give this to you.
Juniper is stunned. She looks at the bag, then at the boys.
JUNIPER
You've met Mud?
Ellis nods. Neckbone speaks up from the back.
NECKBONE
Yeah we met him.
Juniper takes the bag. She removes the letter and takes a
seat on the edge of the bed to read it.
Ellis watches her eyes move along the paper. She smiles,
which makes Ellis smile. After a moment, she folds it up.
JUNIPER
He tells me to hold tight.
59.
NECKBONE
Yeah, we read it.
Juniper raises her eyebrows at Neckbone.
JUNIPER
Well do you know how long `hold
tight' is?
ELLIS
I think it's a couple days. He
wants to get a boat for ya'll.
JUNIPER
God.
Juniper shakes her head and goes to the sink. She pulls a
lighter from her jeans pocket and torches Mud's note.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
Tell him I'll wait.
Running water over the ashes, she turns back to them.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
But I don't want ya'll involved.
Tell him what I said and make that
it. I don't want you gettin' in
any trouble.
ELLIS
We won't.
JUNIPER
What do you call that?
She motions to his swelling eye. Ellis shrugs.
ELLIS
We'll be all right. Keep your door
locked. We'll be in touch.
Ellis heads to the door as Neckbone gathers up the cooler.
JUNIPER
Wait.
Ellis turns back.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
What's your name?
ELLIS
I'm Ellis. That's Neckbone.
60.
Juniper walks up to Ellis and puts her hands on his
shoulders. She has to bend slightly to do it, but she kisses
him just above his swollen eye.
JUNIPER
Thank you Ellis.
Ellis stares at her, infatuated.
NECKBONE
We gotta go.
Ellis turns and grabs one end of the cooler. Neckbone slaps
back the security latch and opens the door with his free
hand. They walk out.
Ellis enters his houseboat. It's quiet.
He sees a note on the counter next to a can of soup. It
reads, "I've gone to a movie. Warm up some soup for dinner.
Love, Mom". Ellis picks up the can, not thrilled.
He goes to the fridge and grabs a sack of peas from the
freezer. Holding the peas against his eye he takes a seat at
the counter and flips through a phone book.
He finds what he needs and dials a corded phone. He waits.
61.
ELLIS
Hello? Is May Pearl there?...This
is Ellis...Hey, it's Ellis. Hey...
What?...In the phone book... from
his car commercials...I think
they're all right...Tomorrow? Yeah,
I can meet you... Okay. Bye.
Ellis hangs up the phone. With the peas pressed firmly
against his face, he smirks.
CUT TO:
66 SERIES OF IMAGES: 66
-Neckbone's sneaker busts through a rotten plank of wood.
-Inside a decrepit wooden shack, Ellis gives Neckbone a look
like he's a dumbass as they proceed to take the shack apart
board by board. Ellis now has a full-on BLACK EYE.
A66 -Neckbone stands lookout under the carport section of Ellis' A66
houseboat. The coast clear, he gives Ellis a nod. Ellis
pops open a metal locker and removes a small chainsaw and
container of gas. He loads these into an empty fish cooler.
B66 -Tom, sitting atop his houseboat with his pellet gun, watchesB66
as the two boys sneak the tools away. He's displeased.
C66 -At Neckbone's mobile home park, Ellis heaves loops of thick C66
rope onto their mini dirt bike trailer. Neckbone stands
nearby laughing with the rope's OWNER, a lanky guy with brown
teeth and a Tasmanian Devil tattoo on his neck.
AC66 -Ellis hoists Neckbone up by the foot allowing him to AC66
unscrew a road sign.
D66 -A mop soaked in black tar slops across the flat roof of the D66
furniture store in downtown Dewitt. Neckbone and Ellis stand
in the store's parking lot yelling up to the ROOFERS.
-They get one's attention, and Neckbone points to a dried
pile of leftover tar that has been dumped at the back of the
building. The ROOFER swats a hand at the boys. They proceed
to load the dried hunk onto the small trailer.
E66 -From a distance, Neckbone and Ellis stand on a sailboat in E66
the middle of a fenced-in marine junkyard. Surrounded by old
boat parts, the boys begin shuttling several large metal
pulleys off the sailboat.
This houseboat, although similar in size, is different than
Ellis'. It's an actual wood shack that has been constructed
atop a barge.
Ellis looks at photos, books and memorabilia that cram the
walls and shelves. It feels homey.
Tom, his back to the boy, stands in the kitchen area pouring
a cup of coffee.
TOM
You been seein' Mud?
ELLIS
No.
70.
A collection of framed photos on a desk catches Ellis'
attention. A young Tom with a pretty dark skinned girl.
They seem happy. Another photo, late 60's, of Tom standing
alone in a suit. He holds a LONG SUITCASE.
Tom enters holding two cups of coffee.
TOM
You don't have to lie to me boy.
He hands Ellis a cup of coffee with a cartoon image of a dog
on it. It reads, "I'm a real bitch in the morning!" Tom
sits in a LazyBoy that he gently rocks in.
TOM (CONT'D)
I've seen you runnin' around.
Takin' things. He all right?
ELLIS
He's okay.
TOM
He get that boat down?
Ellis nods. There is an awkward moment.
ELLIS
He called you an assassin.
Tom snorts out a laugh, sips his coffee.
ELLIS (CONT'D)
Is it true?
TOM
How long have you known Mud?
ELLIS
Few days.
TOM
Well that's long enough to know
he's full of shit.
ELLIS
So it's not true.
TOM
I was a sharpshooter in the army.
In Mud's world, that makes me an
assassin. Not exactly true, right?
ELLIS
Yeah I guess.
Tom notices the boy's disappointment.
71.
TOM
You think he's a bad ass don't you?
ELLIS
I don't know.
TOM
You know why he's stuck out on that
island?
ELLIS
Yeah.
(HESITATES)
He shot somebody.
TOM
He tell you why he shot that man?
ELLIS
Because he hurt Juniper.
TOM
Right. The real reason Mud's in
the trouble he's got is because of
her. He's been in love with that
girl since he was your age. They
used to run all around here and it
was the same back then. He'd
follow that girl wherever she led
him. Problem is she don't care
about nobody but herself. I've
told him as much. She'd bed down
with the meanest snake she could
find, then when things went bad
she'd go runnin' to Mud. Mud would
take her back, then go find
whatever unlucky sonofabitch last
put a hand on her and beat `em `til
they knew to never touch her again.
And this time I guess he thought a
beating wasn't good enough. Had to
shoot that fella. I don't know for
sure, but I'd put money on Juniper
knowin' he'd do it. And I have a
suspicion she might of even told
him to. Either way, those two are
set for failure. Only chance Mud
has is to cut her loose. Cause
I'll tell you what, Mud's no bad
ass. He's runnin' scared.
Ellis can't look Tom in the eye, he's offended by the old
man's remarks. Ellis sets the coffee cup on the desk.
ELLIS
I gotta go.
Ellis heads for the door, but stops short.
72.
ELLIS (CONT'D)
You're wrong about Juniper. They
love each other and they're gonna
make it. If you weren't a wore out
old man you'd know it was true.
Tom eyes the boy, taking a sip from his cup. He nods a
goodbye to Ellis who is already out the door.
Carver holds the door open as King steps inside. A door to
his left connects another room which is empty.
An episode of the Smurfs plays on the television. There's a
MAN on each of the queen beds. Another THREE playing cards
at a small table by the window. MILLER stands in the corner
smoking. Empty Budweiser cans litter the room.
King, unimpressed by the scene, looks at his son. Carver
quickly moves in front of the television and turns it off.
He stares down the men on the beds.
78.
CARVER
Get up.
(to the others)
Ya'll pay attention.
The men get up from the beds and the others put down their
cards. Everyone slowly gathers into an audience.
CARVER (CONT'D)
This is my father, King. He runs
the show.
Carver recedes as King steps forward. He speaks like a high
school football coach.
KING
Men. I wanna thank you for the
work you're doin'. It's important
work, and I want you to know what
it means to me personally. I'm
grateful for it. No man should
have to bury his son. It's not
natural, and it's a pain I hope
none of you ever have to endure.
King removes a photocopied picture of Mud from his pocket.
He unfolds it, stares at it, then raises it to the men.
KING (CONT'D)
This man did that to me. He took
my youngest boy. And now, you're
gonna help me get him.
King stares at the men, keeping the photo held high.
KING (CONT'D)
Now gather `round. Come on now, in
a circle. I want ya'll to join
hands.
They do it reluctantly.
KING (CONT'D)
Everybody take a knee.
They do. King joins them on his knee and grabs Carver and
another Man's hands.
KING (CONT'D)
Bow your heads. I need you to help
me pray for the death of the man
that killed my son.
They all bow their heads.
79.
The boys open the front door and are met by a BLINDING LIGHT.
NECKBONE
Jesus!
They squint and shield their eyes.
The light shuts off as quickly as it came on. Galen stands
in front of them wearing his wet suit. The bar with the
flood lights attached sits across his shoulders.
The boys rub their eyeballs, seeing spots. Galen shuffles
over to the couch holding a marine battery connected to the
lights. He labors to take a seat.
GALEN
What do you think?
79A.
NECKBONE
That's real good Galen.
(TO ELLIS)
Gimme a minute.
Neckbone, still blinking, goes back to his room. Ellis
notices Galen staring at him. Galen pats the couch.
GALEN
Come `ere Ellis.
Ellis takes a seat on the other end of the couch. Galen pats
the spot next to him. Ellis scoots over, uncomfortable.
GALEN (CONT'D)
(POINTING UP)
You see that ceiling fan?
ELLIS
Yeah.
GALEN
I found it in the river. Works
great. Best ceiling fan I've ever
owned. This river brings a lotta
trash down it. Some a that trash
is worth a lotta money, some of
it's not. You gotta know what's
worth keepin' and what's worth
lettin' go. You know the
difference?
ELLIS
I think so.
GALEN
Neck looks up to you. Don't get my
nephew into anything you can't get
him out of.
Galen forces a stare with Ellis, who nods. Neckbone enters
as Galen begins to remove his light rig.
GALEN (CONT'D)
Help Me Rhonda's just about a guy
needing to get a piece to get over
a girl that put one over on him.
So you get your heart broke, don't
walk around with a shit look on
your face. Get back in there. Get
your tip wet. You hear me?
ELLIS
What?
GALEN
You know what I'm sayin'.
79B.
Ellis doesn't. Galen moves to an electric guitar leaning by
a small amp in the corner.
GALEN (CONT'D)
Ya'll wanna hang out? Alan's
comin' over. We're gonna pump it
up.
NECKBONE
We got stuff to do.
GALEN
Whatever.
The boys exit as Galen turns on the amp.
The MOTEL CLERK(29) doesn't look up from his issue of
Lowrider as Ellis and Neckbone enter.
ELLIS
Scuse me, sir?
MOTEL CLERK
Yeah.
86.
ELLIS
We're lookin' for the girl in room
212. You seen her?
MOTEL CLERK
I've seen her.
ELLIS
You see her today.
MOTEL CLERK
Yeah, she came down askin' for
directions to the nearest bar. I
told her to head out to a place on
61.
Ellis digests this. They turn to leave.
MOTEL CLERK (CONT'D)
Wait a second, are ya'll the little
bastards tryin' to sell fish to the
guests?
They're already out the door.
The small bar is loud and crowded. Shoulder to shoulder
PATRONS bump against one another as MUSIC blares.
Neckbone and Ellis press through the crowd searching for
Juniper. They are a good foot shorter than anyone else.
Ellis notices a man at the bar. It's Miller, the bounty
hunter from King's motel. He's staring at something across
the room. Ellis follows his line of sight.
The crowd weaves in front of him, but then he sees her.
Juniper leans against a pool table at the far end of the bar.
A GUY(32) whispers in her ear and kisses her neck. She
throws her head back, laughing. Ellis watches in disbelief.
Nearby, the BARTENDER(46) fills a customer's shot glass. The
two underage kids catch his attention.
87.
Ellis' face is frozen, locked on Juniper. Neckbone places a
hand on his shoulder.
Juniper's eyes drift toward the boys. She makes eye contact
with Ellis, and her smile vanishes. The Guy keeps whispering
in her ear. Juniper straightens her back slightly.
Ellis can't take his eyes off her. Juniper stares back at
him, but doesn't make a move.
After a moment, Juniper's eyes fall to the floor. She turns
her head back to the Guy. The crowd fills back in and the
image is out of Ellis' reach.
BARTENDER (O.S.)
What the hell are ya'll doin'?!
The Bartender swoops in, grabbing them both by the backs of
their necks and shoving them toward the door. Ellis strains
against the thick hand. He tries to get another look at
Juniper, but it's too crowded.
Neckbone snores, sprawled out on top of a sleeping bag on the
floor. Ellis sits up in bed with something on his mind.
He gets up and steps gingerly over Neckbone to exit the room.
The house is silent. Ellis slips into the kitchen and picks
up the phone receiver mounted on the cabinet.
91.
He pulls the cord out to stand with his face in the corner.
He dials, waits, and speaks softly into the receiver.
ELLIS
Hello? Is May Pearl there...This
is Ellis...I called yesterday, you
give her my message?...My name is
Ellis. I'm her boyfriend...Oh,
she's asleep...I said she's asleep?
The front door flies open. Senior storms headlong toward
Ellis. He shouts.
SENIOR
MARY LEE!
Ellis turns as Senior yanks the phone by the cord. It snaps
out of Ellis' hand and smashes apart on the floor. Ellis
flinches at the sight of his father flying at him.
SENIOR (CONT'D)
What the hell have you been doing?
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOIN'?!!
Senior grabs Ellis by the arms and shoves him against the den
wall. Mary Lee comes running from her room.
MARY LEE
SENIOR! SENIOR DAMMIT!
She slaps at her husband's arms and back. He swats her away.
SENIOR
You tell her. You tell her what
you've been up to.
ELLIS
I don't know what you're sayin'.
MARY LEE
Take your hands off him Senior!
Senior keeps Ellis pinned to the wall with his left hand. He
opens up and addresses Mary Lee with his right.
SENIOR
J.J. Crawford said a boat motor
went missin' from his stock yard.
Said his daughter saw this one and
his friend haulin' it off.
This makes Mary Lee pause.
SENIOR (CONT'D)
Now you tell me right now, did you
steal that motor?
92.
ELLIS
We didn't steal it.
SENIOR
Lie to me again.
ELLIS
We thought it was junk. We didn't
think it was worth anything.
MARY LEE
Ellis?
A cool anger rushes over Senior's face. He releases Ellis
and takes a step back.
SENIOR
You tell me I raised a thief?
ELLIS
I'm not a thief.
SENIOR
You take property that's not yours.
Property that belongs to another
man. That junk is his livelihood.
I'm ashamed of you.
Ellis drops his head. His face flushed.
MARY LEE
Senior.
SENIOR
(to Mary Lee)
Shut your mouth. You think you can
take things and not have him see
it? Neither one of you has any
respect for a man's livelihood. A
life that puts clothes on your back
and food in your stomach.
MARY LEE
Don't you blame this on me. One
doesn't have a thing to do with the
other and you know it.
SENIOR
Don't tell me what I know. If you
can steal a man's life out from
under him in front of your son and
think he won't take a lesson from
it than you're even dumber than you
look.
ELLIS
Stop it dad.
93.
Senior volleys a finger at Ellis.
SENIOR
She's raisin' you a snake like
herself, and you can curl up with
her `fore I give a damn. You just
remember this when you watch them
rip this house apart board by
board. You Hear Me!
Mary Lee slaps Senior hard. He turns to her, saying nothing.
MARY LEE
You're a man who's never had the
strength to support his own life.
I never asked you for a thing, and
I've never took a thing from you
that I couldn't provide for on my
own. If they do tear my home apart
the only joy I'll have in my heart
is knowin' that they'll be tearing
you out of my life for good.
She wipes her eyes and turns her attention to Ellis.
MARY LEE (CONT'D)
Ellis. You'll return that motor
from where you found it and you'll
apologize in person to the man you
took it from. I won't hear about
anything like this again.
Mary Lee walks to the front door. She collects her purse and
keys and exits quietly.
Senior and Ellis stand in silence, which feels even more
uncomfortable than the shouting. Ellis finally speaks.
ELLIS
I can't take that motor back. But
I'll pay him for it. I'll pay him
what he wants for it.
Senior, stoic, pivots his body away from the boy.
SENIOR
I don't care what you do Ellis.
Senior retreats to the bedroom. Ellis is left alone in the
wake.
He looks to his room. The door opens slightly and Neckbone
takes a step out. Neckbone doesn't say anything. He just
bites at his lip, sympathy for his friend.
94.
The bed is unmade and the room is a bit of a mess. Ellis
keeps his head down. Juniper closes the door and takes a
seat on the edge of the bed. She grabs the remote control
and mutes the television.
JUNIPER
I'm sorry about last night. I
didn't plan on...
Before she can finish Ellis has fished the letter out of his
pocket and holds it out to her.
ELLIS
I'm supposed to give this to you.
Juniper takes the letter.
JUNIPER
Okay.
Ellis goes to the door. He pulls the bedroom curtain back
slightly to check the parking lot. The coast is clear.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
Did you read it?
ELLIS
No. I gotta go.
JUNIPER
Ellis?
He turns to her.
98.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
I'm sorry.
ELLIS
All you had to do was be there.
JUNIPER
I couldn't.
ELLIS
Then why'd you even come here?
JUNIPER
I came here to leave with him. I
really did. But now...now I guess
I just came to say goodbye.
His eyes fall to the floor.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
You don't know us Ellis. We've
been headin' this way for a long
time.
ELLIS
I know he'd do anything for you.
She puts her cigarette out in a Coke can on the floor.
JUNIPER
You really believe that?
Ellis nods. Juniper speaks to him gently, almost smiling.
It's a look of resignation.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
Mud's a born liar. That's what
makes him so likable. He makes
people feel good about themselves.
He's a romantic. I don't think he
means to hurt people. But when
people get close to him, that's
what happens.
Ellis watches her as she goes to the sink and wets the end of
a towel. She dabs her eyes at the mirror.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
I do love him Ellis. But I can't
spend the rest of my life runnin'
with him. I may not know what kind
of life I want, but I know that's
not it.
Her back to him, Ellis watches as she unfolds the letter and
begins reading. He angles himself to see her face in the
mirror. He watches her eyes scanning the words. No emotion.
99.
She finishes, folds the letter back up, then turns to him.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
Tell him I understand.
ELLIS
What's it say?
JUNIPER
It says it's over. Tell him I've
packed my things. Tell him I've
gone.
She takes a deep breath and smiles at him.
JUNIPER (CONT'D)
Bye Ellis.
Ellis turns and walks out.
Ellis, riding the dirtbike, looks to his left into the Sonic
Drive-In parking lot. The high school kids have gathered
there again.
He notices a rust colored Ford coup. The driver, an older
kid named KYLE(18), sits beside May Pearl laughing.
Ellis steers into traffic and crosses the street. He pulls
onto a patch of grass at the edge of the Sonic parking lot.
In one motion, Ellis tumps the bike on its side and makes a b-
line for the coup.
INSIDE THE CAR,
Kyle's hand is on May Pearl's knee.
100.
KYLE
So what'd she say?
MAY PEARL
She said she didn't like him that
much. I told her I thought he was
all right.
Ellis appears with his elbows in the driver's side window.
He sticks his head so far in the door that Kyle has to lean
back in his seat to make room. May Pearl is surprised. Kyle
snorts out a laugh.
ELLIS
You get my phone calls?
MAY PEARL
What?
ELLIS
I've been callin' you.
(motions with his head)
Who's this guy?
KYLE
Get your head outta my car kid.
Ellis takes his right elbow and quickly knocks Kyle in the
mouth. It splits his upper lip. Kyle grabs his face.
KYLE (CONT'D)
Shit!
MAY PEARL
Ellis!
ELLIS
I called you twice yesterday. Your
sister didn't tell you?
Kyle slings the door open knocking Ellis to the pavement.
From the ground, Ellis can see that Kyle is big and
considerably tougher than the skinny kid he punched before.
Kyle's friends from other cars take notice and begin to
converge on them.
Ellis makes a move for Kyle's legs but is kicked back to the
pavement. Kyle straddles him on the ground and punches him.
Another punch to Ellis' face. May Pearl is out of the car
and yelling.
MAY PEARL
Kyle! Stop it Kyle!
101.
May Pearl pulls Kyle by the collar. By his own will, he
raises off of Ellis, keeping an eye on him.
A streak of blood stretches from Ellis' nose to his ear. He
gets to his feet, dazed.
Ellis wipes at his nose and sees May Pearl shove Kyle. Kyle
smiles and turns to his friends, who laugh. The CROWD that
has collected consists of older high school guys and girls.
Ellis steps toward May Pearl and is met with a shove too.
MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
What the hell are you doin' here
Ellis?!
ELLIS
What?
MAY PEARL
You can't just run up and punch
people I'm with!
ELLIS
I'm sorry, I just wanted to know
why you hadn't called me back.
I...
MAY PEARL
Why would I call you back Ellis?
ELLIS
Because you're my girlfriend.
The crowd is watching.
MAY PEARL
I'm not your girlfriend! We went
on one date. One!
ELLIS
We kissed.
MAY PEARL
That doesn't matter!
ELLIS
Yeah but...
MAY PEARL
But what Ellis?! What did you
expect?!
ELLIS
I love you.
102.
MAY PEARL
You're fourteen!
ELLIS
Don't. Wait. We can make this
work. We can figure it out. I
love you.
MAY PEARL
What?
Ellis is losing it. His eyes are red. He looks at the crowd
of kids. There are smiles and some snickering. May Pearl is
speechless. She just stares at him.
Ellis turns and walks back to the dirt bike.
May Pearl's girlfriends gather around her. She shakes her
head, dumbstruck.
Ellis lifts the bike off the ground. He looks back at May
Pearl who appears to be shrugging off the whole affair in
front of her friends. Ellis speeds off.
The reception area has a DOZEN PATIENTS sitting in it. A
check-in desk to the left. Mud holds Ellis out in his arms.
MUD
I NEED HELP HERE!
A FEMALE NURSE rushes out of the check-in area.
FEMALE NURSE
Just stay calm. What's going on?
MUD
He's been snake bit.
ANOTHER NURSE rushes off calling for a doctor. The room
becomes more frenzied. Patients talking. Nurses shouting.
109.
MUD (CONT'D)
He's snake bit. A cotton mouth.
On his calf. Just under an hour.
As quickly as Mud gets this out, a GROUP of NURSES rush out
of a door at the end of the room pushing a gurney.
They take Ellis from Mud's arm, place him on the gurney, and
speed him into the back of the clinic.
The commotion gone, the reception area feels oddly still.
Mud takes a deep breath.
He looks to his right. Patients stare at him. He's beyond
disheveled. He's crazy looking.
Mud turns to his left. The Male Nurse stares at him. For
the first time, Mud realizes he's out in the open.
MALE NURSE
Sir?
Mud slowly backs up.
MALE NURSE (CONT'D)
Sir? We're gonna need some
information?
Mud backs out of the automatic doors. The entire room stares
at him.
The Patients in the reception area settle back into their
seats and discuss the commotion.
The Male Nurse enters and walks behind the check-in window.
IN THE WINDOW,
The Male Nurse fingers through a pile of papers.
110.
He removes one of the fliers that Carver and his men have
been showing. The Nurse studies the photo, looking back at
the front doors.
He picks up the phone and dials the number at the bottom.
In the adjoining room, the phone rings. King steps through
the doorway, takes a seat on the bed, and answers.
KING
Hello...Yes...Yessir we are...Uh
huh.
King takes a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on a pad
on the nightstand.
KING (CONT'D)
Now where'd you say you
were?...Okay...He's gone.
Okay...But you say he left the
boy?...And your name sir?
His eyes open. Ellis bolts up in bed covered in a cold
sweat. Mary Lee places a palm on his chest.
MARY LEE
It's okay. You're okay. Just set
back.
Mary Lee guides Ellis back down on the pillow. Senior stands
with his arm on her shoulder. They look down at their son.
ELLIS
Where am I?
MARY LEE
You're home. We got you home.
Ellis takes a second to get his bearings. His mother lifts a
glass of Sprite up to his mouth. He takes a sip.
SENIOR
You had us scared son.
Senior steps forward and kisses Ellis on the forehead.
Staying close to his face.
SENIOR (CONT'D)
(WHISPERS)
I'm so glad you're okay.
MARY LEE
The doctors gave you some medicine.
You had a snake bite.
112.
ELLIS
How'd I get to the doctor?
MARY LEE
A man brought you in. No one knew
him.
Ellis tries to sit up in bed, but his mother stops him.
MARY LEE (CONT'D)
It's okay. You just need to rest
up now. We can talk all about it
later. Do you need anything? Are
you hungry?
ELLIS
No.
Senior gently pats her shoulders.
SENIOR
Come on. Let's let him rest.
Mary Lee touches Senior's hand on her shoulder. She stands.
MARY LEE
I'll be back in to check on you but
just try and sleep if you can.
ELLIS
Okay.
Senior leads Mary Lee to the door.
ELLIS (CONT'D)
Mom? Dad?
They turn back.
ELLIS (CONT'D)
I love ya'll.
MARY LEE
We love you too Ellis.
They exit the room. Ellis rests his head back on the pillow
and takes a deep breath.
Ellis stares at the ceiling, unable to sleep. A TAP comes
from the window. Ellis sits up in bed. Mud pokes his head
in. He whispers.
MUD
Ellis?
ELLIS
Mud?
MUD
Yeah.
Mud pulls his body through the window. It's tight but he
manages to make it look somewhat graceful. Mud takes a quick
survey of the dark room. Ellis begins to get out of bed.
MUD (CONT'D)
No, don't get up.
Mud motions him back down and pulls the chair from the desk
over to the bed. They speak in hushed voices.
ELLIS
How'd you get here?
MUD
Neck brought me.
MUD
We got the boat in the water.
ELLIS
You did?
115.
MUD
Just now. Smooth sailin' from here
on out.
ELLIS
Good.
MUD
Wish you coulda seen it.
ELLIS
Me too.
MUD
Didn't feel right leavin' town
without sayin' goodbye.
There is an awkward moment.
ELLIS
I'm sorry `bout what I said.
MUD
No. No. You were right to be mad.
You were right about a lot of
things. I'm the one that's sorry.
I shoulda never gotten ya'll into
all this. I just didn't see any
other way around it. But I
couldn't leave without you knowin'
I never lied about being your
friend. I never lied about that.
ELLIS
I know.
MUD
I don't traffic in the truth too
often. But I did love her. I do
love her.
ELLIS
She loves you too. She said it.
This fact still strikes Mud. He nods.
MUD
I just made mistakes. We both did.
This is a hard life to keep up
with. You can't blame her for
gettin' tired of tryin'.
ELLIS
My dad says you can't count on
women lovin' you. He says you
can't trust it.
116.
MUD
That's not true. Don't judge your
life on all of our mistakes.
You'll make plenty mistakes of your
own, no need takin' on everybody
else's. You're a good man Ellis.
If you find a girl half as good,
you'll be all right.
ELLIS
You're a good man too Mud.
Mud smiles.
MUD
No. I'm not. But maybe from here
on out I can be...
A SHOTGUN BLAST rips a fist-sized hole in the flimsy interior
wall. Mud, as if by reflex, yanks Ellis from the sheets and
shoves him under the bed.
BOOM. BOOM.
Bits of sheetrock fall like snow flakes as more holes blast
through the bedroom wall. Mud flinches with each shot. He
covers his own head with one hand and the boy with the other.
ELLIS
Mud?!
MUD
Stay put! JUST STAY UNDER THERE!
The SOUND of shotgun shells being slipped into the chamber.
Mud gets to a crouch. Through the holes in the wall, Mud
makes out Nelson, the fat bounty hunter, reloading his gun.
138 IN THE DEN, 138
Nelson finishes reloading. The riddled bedroom wall hangs in
front of him. A door opens behind him. He swivels around.
Senior, in a robe, rushes from his bedroom with a pistol
leveled. He's met with a shotgun blast just above his head.
Pellets nick his face. Senior hits the ground and elbows his
way back inside his bedroom door.
SENIOR
ELLIS! ELLIS!
Senior screams, his voice cracking.
139 IN ELLIS' ROOM, 139
117.
SENIOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
(muffled through the wall)
ELLIS!
MUD
(WHISPERING)
Don't move Ellis. Just stay put.
They just want me.
Through the holes Mud sees Nelson approaching Ellis' bedroom.
He runs for the window at the foot of the bed. Another
shotgun BLAST throws open the door as Mud leaps out.
Still under the bed, Ellis tries to hold his breath as
Nelson's boots step into the room. They pause for a moment,
before sluggishly struggling through the bedroom window.
Mud gets to his feet, stepping over an unconscious Nelson on
his way to the bedroom door.
MUD
You still down there bud?
ELLIS
Yeah.
MUD
Stay put.
Mud pops out of the bedroom into the den.
119.
148 IN SENIOR'S BEDROOM, 148
Mary Lee, curled under the bed, frantically dials the phone.
Senior, propped against the closed door, uses his undershirt
to dab the pellet wounds around his neck.
Hearing footsteps, he cracks the door open. He sees Mud
standing in the den. Senior cocks his pistol
149 IN THE DEN, 149
The front door is KICKED open. Mud dives behind a Lazy Boy
as a Bounty Hunter fires through the doorway.
The back of the Lazy Boy explodes in fluff and fabric. Mud
raises up to return fire, forcing the Man back out the door.
Mud crouches back behind the Lazy Boy. Unbeknownst to him,
another MAN appears outside two sliding glass doors. The Man
raises his rifle at Mud.
One of Tom's bullets rips through the Man's chest and
shatters the glass door. Mud flinches. Another Hunter steps
into the now broken door frame. Mud FIRES the shotgun,
blowing the man into the patio grill.
A149 Mud can see Tom's houseboat silhouetted across the A149
bayou. A muzzle FLASH sparks from the top of Tom's
boat. This makes Mud smile.
150 The Front Door kicks open again and more pellets shatter 150
through the den. Mud raises to return fire.
ONE SHOT, TWO, the third is a dead CLICK. He drops back
behind the chair, out of shells.
IN THE DEN,
The Hunters at the front door continue taking pot shots at
the furniture.
Mud flinches at each new round fired.
153 IN ELLIS' ROOM, 153
120.
Ellis cautiously slides out from under his bed and crouches
next to the bedroom door. He peeks through a crack.
He sees Mud pinned behind the Lazy Boy. They make eye
contact. Mud's eyes move to something behind Ellis.
Ellis turns to see James passing by his bedroom window.
The firing from the front door has stopped. Mud takes a deep
breath, sets the empty shotgun on the ground, then rushes out
the sliding glass doors as the men out front reload.
The phone rings in the Pines Motel. King enters from the
adjoining room and takes a seat on the bed. He answers.
KING
Hello...You're speaking to him...
King listens. His face taut.
KING (CONT'D)
He's dead?
(a long pause)
Okay.
King hangs up the phone. He sits at the edge of the bed,
overwhelmed by the news.
