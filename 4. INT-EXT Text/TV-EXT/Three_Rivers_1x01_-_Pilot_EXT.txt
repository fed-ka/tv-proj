      Sunlight streams through oak trees draped with moss.  We hear 
      FOOTSTEPS on pavement and ORGAN MUSIC, faint but getting 
      stronger, as we follow a MAN walking toward a small brick 
      church.


      A small, one-story cinderblock building.  Looks more like a 7-
      11 than a medical facility, but the sign out front announces, 
       PAWLEY S ISLAND CLINIC. 


      Driving wind and rain bend the trees, lashing their limbs 
      against the windows of the small building.


      ... which David loads into the back of an ambulance along 
      with three others.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  49.

      CONTINUED:

      Looking at the coolers, David has a sudden thought, runs into 
      the hospital, passing Miranda on her way out.

                                  DAVID
                          (to Miranda)
                    Be right back.


      Dr. Yorn hands the red cooler to Miranda, who pulls the tape 
      bearing Mark Wilson s name from her scrubs and affixes it to 
      the top.

                                  DR. YORN
                    Mark Wilson is very lucky.

                                    MIRANDA
                    Let s hope they all are.

                                  DR. YORN
                    If you re ever in West Virginia...

                                    MIRANDA 
                    You ll throw me out?

      Miranda smiles.  So does Yorn.  Inder, Ryan and finally David 
      climb in the back.  Miranda and Yorn close the ambulance 
      doors.  Miranda runs through the rain to the passenger door, 
      jumps in.  LIGHTS and SIRENS and the ambulance heads for the 
      airfield with our team.

      3-WAY SPLIT SCREEN 

      THREE RIVERS ICU: Wilson's wife watches nervously yet 
      hopefully, as Andy and his team wheel Wilson out of ICU.   

      ALVIN is alone, staring into space, his eyes watery and lost.

      the storm --
                                                                          FADE OUT.
                                  END OF ACT THREE      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  50.


                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      LIGHTS AND SIRENS as an ambulance rushes up.  Miranda jumps 
      out of the passenger seat, David and Inder pour out of the 
      back, grabbing coolers.  Miranda grabs the red igloo cooler, 
      sprints into the hospital.


      Exhausted from crying and no sleep, Miranda looks out at the 
      panoramic view of Pittsburgh at night.  Bridges in every 
      direction, their arches lit up in the night, reflecting on 
      the water of the three rivers.  A sign on the hospital wing 
      facing her, reads:  WILLIAM H. FOSTER TRANSPLANT INSTITUTE.  
      Andy exits the stairwell and joins Miranda at the railing.  A 
      long moment of silence, then Andy says --

                                  ANDY
                    We don t control anything.

                                    MIRANDA
                    That s not what my father believed.  
                    He said it was up to us.  To be the 
                    best at what we do, to never give 
                    up, to take chances and do the 
                    thing no one else can do because 
                    we re their last hope.

                                  ANDY
                    We re just one piece of the puzzle.
                          (looking out)
                    Somewhere out there, somebody s 
                    getting up to go to work and they 
                    have no idea they re going to 
                    become a donor today.  And somebody 
                    they ve never met will live because 
                    they died. 

      Looks to Miranda.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  58.

      CONTINUED:


                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                    You did your part.  Took every 
                    chance you could.  You wouldn t 
                    give up on that heart, even flew in 
                    a damn hurricane.  And because you 
                    did, Alvin Weathers and three other 
                    people are going to live.  Let s 
                    take the win and go home.

      They hold a look for a moment, then, Miranda lets go of the 
      railing and they head inside.
