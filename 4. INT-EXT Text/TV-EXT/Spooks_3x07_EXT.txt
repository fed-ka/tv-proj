      An ambulance speeds past, siren blaring.

      Harry walks with a cool headed GUY FACER, the Security and 
                                                                                              *

                                                                                              *
      appointed to a newly created post, and hugely ambitious.

                          (incensed)
                    But we re nowhere near 
                      authenticating the letter.

                                  GUY
                    It doesn t matter.  We re releasing 
                    it this afternoon. 

                                  HARRY
                    That s ludicrous, it s 
                      irresponsible.  More than that ... 
                    it s borderline criminal.

                                  GUY
                    Recent statements from Al Qaeda 
                    have referred to them targeting 
                    financial and infrastructure damage 
                    rather than physical damage, 
                    haven t they?

                                  HARRY
                    Yes, but ...

                                  GUY
                          (interrupting)
                    We re releasing it, Harry.  

                                  HARRY
                    Look, right now people are wary of 
                    taking medication but that s where 
                    it stops.  Telling them their pills 
                    are being fiddled with by faceless 
                      terrorists and you raise the dread 
                    to a whole new level ... what s 
                    next?  Milk?  Water?  To say 
                    nothing of potentially triggering 
                    another round of racial violence.

                    Of course you do.  

                                  GUY
                    Don t get me wrong, Harry.  The PM 
                    believes this to be an act of 
                      terrorism.  Which it undoubtedly 
                    is.

                                  HARRY
                    I think we d all be on safer ground 
                    if people acted more on evidence 
                    than on belief.  Especially where 
                    others  lives are concerned, 
                    wouldn t you say? 

                                  GUY

                    What s next?  Are muggings going to 
                    be brought under this mythical 
                       terrorism  umbrella of yours?  
                    People are already scared out 
                    there.  There s no need to make 
                    their lives any more fearful.  

                                  GUY
                    And there s no point pouring all 
                    our resources into waging a war 
                    against terrorism if we can t point 
                    our fingers at what it is we re 
                    fighting.

                    it s just some demented crackpot 
                    toiling away in a dingy basement in 
                    Coventry?  We ll look like mugs and 
                    you -- you could alienate a lot of 
                    voters -- which I know is something 
                    rather dear to your heart. You d

                    We take hits, Danny.  And usually 
                    when we lose people, it s because 
                    they ve been killed.  It s part of

                    That was pretty much established on

      A beat.  Not one of Adam s fondest memories, coaching someone

      The calm before the storm.  A few WORSHIPPERS walk up the 
      street and into the mosque.  All watched from ...

      A surveillance van, parked around the corner.

      A second van has pulled up.  NEWS CREWS step out of them, 
      cameras are slung over shoulders, mikes readied.

      Adam storms up to the news crews.  A REPORTER sees him 
      rushing over, motions to the CAMERAMAN to get the shot.  Adam 
      pushes the camera away just as it comes up.

                                  ADAM
                    Put that away.

                    vans and get the hell out of here.

      The reporter motions for the cameraman to get filming and 
      puts his mike in Adam s face.

                                  REPORTER
                    We got a tip off that the mosque 
                    was about to be raided.

      Adam pushes his mike down ...

                    What part of get the hell out of 
                    here don t you understand?

      ... but the reporter relents.

                                  REPORTER
                    Is it true that the hacker attacks 
                    on the banks are the work of 
                    Islamic cyberterrorists linked to 
                    Al Qaeda?  Is that what you re 
                    doing here? 

      He drifts off, his eyes moving worriedly beyond the reporter, 
      towards the mosque.

      ADAM S POV: worshippers outside the mosque are looking at 
      them curiously, realizing something suspicious is going on.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh no.

                    Keep rolling.

      Adam s mind is racing, eyes darting back and forth from the 
      men outside the mosque, to the news crews, to the waiting 
      vans.

                                  ADAM
                          (into mike)
                    We can t do that.  They ll have 
                    time to wipe out the evidence.  

      He glares at the reporters, a murderous anger in his eyes ...

                                  ADAM (cont d)
                    Oh, screw it.

      ... and he charges towards the mosque.

      On Adam s command, an armed squad of SPECIAL FORCES in black 
      hoods and Kevlar pours out of a van.

      for a closer look, some of them shouting out angry racist 
      comments, POLICE holding them back while others bring out 
      handcuffed MEN from the mosque, some bewildered, others 
      defiant.

      Danny reaches an intersection.  He s in a bit of a trance, 
      looking without seeing, then things slow down, it s almost as 
      if he senses something subconsciously.  He notices a man in a 
      car that s stopped at the red light.

      CLOSER ON THE MAN: he s on the phone, bothered, seemingly 
      having an heated argument. 

      DANNY: glances up at his light.  It s red.  He turns, 
      glancing at the other direction.  The light is green.  A big 
      TRUCK is hurtling down towards the intersection.

      He glances back at the man in the car.  Still arguing on his 
      phone.  Another car behind him, a TAXI.  

      He looks up at the light.  It goes from red to green, 
      straight through, no amber.


      The man in the car charges forward, as does the taxi --

      Danny looks back at the other direction, sensing something 
      wrong:

      The light is still green there too.

      He looks further: the truck is still bearing down, now almost 
      at the intersection.

      And before he can react, the truck s horn slices the air, its 
      brakes squealing for a split second but it s too late.

      THE MAN IN THE CAR: looks out his window, eyes wide, doesn t 
      even have time to brake as ...

      DANNY watches in horror as ...

      THE TRUCK PLOUGHS INTO THE CAR, sending it slamming against 
      the taxi, other cars behind them smashing into them in a 
      massive crash.

      PEDESTRIANS jump out of the way of the debris and sliding 
      cars.

      DANNY snaps back to reality, jumps into action, rushes into 
      the fray, fishing his mobile phone out.

      He dials 999 as he reaches the man in the car, who looks 
      mangled and bloodied, and trapped.

      Danny s phone rings a couple of times before a sultry voice 
      comes on the line.

      A pouch is suspended beneath the chopper.  Adam pulls it

      Danny, Adam and special branch officers, all swatted up, 
      surround the house.

      They sneak up to the front door.  A Special Branch officer
