          OVER BLACK we HEAR the SOUND of the SURF.  At least we
          think it's the surf.  The UNIDENTIFIED IMAGES begin to
          FLASH through the blackness, REVEALING a VIOLENT STRUGGLE. 
          ONE, TWO, maybe more, INDIVIDUALS in a life or death FIGHT. 
          We don't HEAR any VOICES, just GRUNTS and GROWLS, MOANS
          and the sense of VIOLENCE.  RAW VIOLENCE.  As the IMAGES
          BUILD in SPEED and INTENSITY, it culminates in a

          SUPER LOUD WHOOSH

          to BLACK, as we HEAR...

                                        WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Wake up sleepy-head!  Breakfast
                        is ready!



          ANOTHER, VIOLENT FLASH OF A PHYSICAL STRUGGLE - ECU: BLACK
          HANDS grab, then rip away a shirt sleeve as WE FLASH TO
          BLACK.



          Falling!  POV as a body careens downward, falling off a
          SEASIDE cliff!



          As the SHOT PANS the fishing area.

                          I checked the blueberry farms and
                        there was no sign of Maiya or her
                          daughter.  They mentioned the
                        lobster boats.



          Bruce and Johnny walk down the dock.

                        How well do you know this woman?

                        We went to college together.  But
                        it's all a little blurry.  Feels
                        like a lifetime ago.

                        Was it something special?

                        I'm not sure.  She asked me to
                        come over last night.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She was getting these phone calls
                        in the middle of the night.  Might
                        be her ex-husband.

                                        BRUCE
                        Sounds like a real mess.

          Bruce continues to smile at him.

                        Why are you smiling like that?

                        Yeah, and it's starting to creep
                        me out.

                        Yeah, I do.

          Bruce stops smiling.

                        Thank you.

                          Whatever you say.

          Johnny shows Bruce the photo of Maiya.

                        She's pretty.

          Johnny drops the photo, as he reaches down to pick it up,
          he loses his balance, grabs onto a piling on the dock to
          steady himself--

          Johnny as Desmond, and Maiya, looking younger, walk hand
          in hand down the dock, laughing.  They sit on the dock
          next to the piling, looking out at the water.

                        I know who you are.  You need to
                        stop calling here in the middle
                        of the night.

                                          JOHNNY/COLE
                          I didn't.  But I bet you did, to
                        scare her into asking you to come
                        over.

                                        DESMOND
                        That's crazy.

                                          JOHNNY/COLE
                        You've always had a thing for
                        her.  She told me.

                                        DESMOND
                        We're friends.  Maiya's afraid of
                        you.  She moved three thousand
                        miles to get away from you.

                                          JOHNNY/COLE
                        Who put that idea into her head?

          Johnny grabs Desmond, pulls him out of the doorway.  As
          they struggle,



          FIGHT FLASH



          Johnny's standing over Desmond's unconscious body, looking
          down at him, horrified.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What have I done?  What's happening
                        to me?

                        It's okay.  Everything will be
                        fine.

          Johnny spins around, but can't see Sarah.  Johnny can't
          put any of this together in his mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah--are you here?  You have to
                        help me.

          Desmond has vanished and Johnny watches as Sarah talks to
          Vision Johnny's unconscious body in a hospital bed.  Sarah
          is holding Vision Johnny's hand.

                                        SARAH
                        You need to concentrate on the
                        sound of my voice.

          Johnny seems confused by what he's seeing.

                                        BRUCE'S VOICE
                        It just keeps getting stranger
                        and stranger, doesn't it?

                        What happened?  Why am I in a
                          hospital bed.

                                        SARAH
                        You're in the hospital, Johnny. 
                        You were hurt.

          Bruce gestures as if to say, 'there ya go!'.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't understand.  I keep seeing
                        the same things, but from different
                          perspectives.  It's like I'm stuck

                                        JOHNNY
                        If I really am trapped in a vision,
                        this conversation has to be part
                        of it.

                        Makes sense... I guess.

                        Johnny, just keep listening to
                        the sound of my voice.  You were
                        found lying beside your car near
                        the coast highway.  Some kids saw
                        you and called the police.

                        I don't remember driving to the

                        You took a blow to the head.  The
                          doctor's are worried that you
                        might slip back into a coma.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (slight sense of panic)
                        No.  That can't happen.

                          possible whatever happened to me
                        hasn't happened yet.

                        Why didn't I think of that?

          Bruce smiles, which makes Johnny think...

                        If that is the future, I might be
                        able to stop it, if I can just
                        find Maiya.  But if I'm stuck in
                          a vision, what are you doing here?

                          I haven't talked to her in years!

                        Then why'd she leave?!

                        Because she thought you were
                        dangerous!

          Even as the words leave his mouth, and Johnny/Cole CLOCKS
          Desmond hard,

          Johnny fights against his natural instincts as Cole.

                        What am I doing?  What's going on
                        inside me?

          Bruce is REVEALED behind him.  He suddenly seems
          frightened, like a child in danger.

                        I must be Cole.  Something keeps
                          switching me from body to body. 
                        I can feel them inside me, their
                        energy, their anger.  I have to
                        keep control.

                        That's good, but I still think we
                        should go.

                                        JOHNNY

                        I think you're right.

          Johnny takes off, but this time he runs across the street
          and gets into a 2002 Mustang GT.  Bruce never moves.



          Johnny/Cole climbs the stairs to the second floor and
          looks for the room number matching the key.  He stops in
          front of ROOM 225 and inserts the key.  Suddenly, Bruce
          steps out through the door.  He startles Johnny, who isn't
          amused.

                        Would you not do that?

          Cole puts a protective arm around Siena, pulling her
          roughly against him, still waving the gun.


          ANGLE ON WALT APPEARING FROM A HIDDEN LOCATION

          behind Cole, we see him approaching stealthily, gun drawn.

                                        COLE
                        It isn't fair.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then let's make it right.

                                        COLE
                        I just wanted her to know me.

          After a beat, he lets go of Siena's hand, gun still trained
          on Johnny.

          Maiya instinctively reaches for her.

                                        MAIYA
                        Please, Cole...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Siena)
                        It's going to be okay.  I promise. 
                        Let her go, Cole.  This isn't the
                        way to keep her.

          Cole stares at Johnny, knows he's already lost her. Johnny
          looks at Siena.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Picasso.  C'mere.

          Siena looks back at Johnny.  Cole doesn't move to stop
          her. She runs towards Johnny.  As Johnny takes her in his
          arms,

                                        WALT O.C
                        Freeze!

          Cole freezes, drops his gun.  Walt, Roscoe and the DEPUTIES
          move in, guns drawn. 

          Maiya, bruised but able to walk, bolts up, rushes towards
          Siena.

                                        MAIYA
                        Siena!

          Maiya gathers her daughter in her arms.  As Johnny looks
          at the hard-earned reunion, knows how it would have turned
          out,

                                                                              TIME CUT:

          Desmond and Maiya cross in from where they have been giving
          their statement to Roscoe.  Maiya has Siena by the hand.

                                        DESMOND
                        This is Johnny Smith, the psychic
                        who helped us find you.

          Maiya smiles up at Johnny, words failing, tears of
            gratitude in her eyes.

                                        SIENA
                        Do you know my Mommy?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  But I feel like I do.

          He smiles at Maiya.

                                        MAIYA
                        How can I ever thank you...?

          Johnny smiles, no thanks necessary.

                                        SIENA
                        You can have my picture.

          As she proudly passes it to him, CLOSE ON the child's
          DRAWING of her mom, hair wild, flying across the sky,
          Siena in tow, flying away from a man who's small down
          below on the ground...

                                        WALT
                        Don't forget this.  Crazy, huh? 
                        Last night we were celebrating
                        your birthday, today you were
                        just hoping to see another one.

          Walt hands Johnny the penknife that made all this possible. 
          Johnny looks at it more closely, is stunned for a beat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you know where JJ got this?

                                        WALT
                        He found it in a box of old stuff
                        at your place.  Shined it all up
                        for you.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I thought it looked familiar.  It
                        was my father's.

                        No kidding?  I guess there's a
                        certain symmetry to that.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Symmetry.  Yeah, you could call
                        it that.

          ON JOHNNY, fingering the penknife in his hand...
