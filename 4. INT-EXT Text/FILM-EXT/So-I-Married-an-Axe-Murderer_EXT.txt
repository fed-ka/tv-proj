Charlie puts the "CLOSED" sign on the door and proceeds to
walk home.
The sights and the sounds of the city are accentuated by the
BEBOP as he sees life, warts and all. As the streets become
less populated, he can now hear the sounds of his own
FOOTSTEPS and, a COUPLE BICKERING. The streets become even
more deserted. The night is closing in on him. A cat darts
out from an alleyway and startles him. He quickens his pace.
RUMBLINGS make him cross the street to avoid the danger.
Headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance.
Charlie, frightened, turns another corner onto:
HIS STREET
He approaches a 3-story Victorian home, in which he has an
apartment on the second floor, he notices a light on in his
window. A CRASHING sound from within.
CUT TO:
HANDS
taking papers out of a desk drawer.
CUT TO:
CHARLIE
carefully opening the front door and then gingerly closing
it. He reaches for a baseball bat in a nearby umbrella stand.
Sound of BREAKING GLASS from his apartment upstairs.
CUT BACK TO:
SHATTERED PICTURE FRAME
with a photo of Charlie and an angelic blonde.
CUT BACK TO:
CHARLIE
finishing off the last two steps nearing the front door of
his apartment, bat raised above his head ready to swing.
CUT TO:
THE HANDS
clasp a jewelry box on the top of the dresser and stuff them
into a dufflebag; the jewelry is followed by CD's.
CUT TO:
CHARLIE
pushing open his apartment door in a mock SWAT maneuver,
then stealthily stalking toward the sound of the intruder in
the bedroom. He stubs his toe on a spring loaded doorstop
making a loud metal VITTSWINGGGG's sound. He freezes,
terrified.
CUT TO:
THE BEDROOM
where the HANDS, freeze.
CUT BACK TO:
CHARLIE
Like a coiled jungle cat ready to pounce, waits two beats...
then springs Samurai style into...
THE BEDROOM
He freezes.
REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL
that the HANDS belong to the angelic blonde in the broken
picture. It's Charlie's girlfriend, SHERRI.
CHARLIE
Sherri! What are you doing?
SHERRI
I'm leaving you.
CHARLIE
Oh, thank God... I thought you were
robbing our own home, because frankly,
that's insane. I mean, what could
you possibly gain by robbing your
own home? I don't mean to meddle,
but isn't it better to rob other
peoples' homes? Start accumulating
their wealth as opposed to just
reaccumulating your own wealth.
SHERRI
That's not funny, Charlie. I'm really
leaving.
She continues to pack. Charlie tries to unpack her things.
CHARLIE
What?! Just because we had a fight
last night?
SHERRI
We've had a fight every night for
two months. Ever since I brought up
the subject of marriage, you've found
fault with everything I do. Why
couldn't we have gotten married,
Charlie?
CHARLIE
(beat)
I'm too young to get married.
(begins putting her
things back)
I'm only twenty-nine and a half. We
love living together.
SHERRI
It's been two years now. I need
something more.
CHARLIE
See, Sherri, this is frustrating for
me, okay. When we first started going
out I thought we agreed that we
weren't the sort of people who got
married.
SHERRI
That's like saying we're not the
sort of people who are going to grow
old. We're not going to fall into
that "growing old" trap. Face it,
you've got a problem with commitment,
Charlie. Take a look at your other
girlfriends. Every time you get close
to a commitment there's something
wrong with them.
CHARLIE
Hey, I broke up with them for good
reasons.
SHERRI
What about Sandy?
CHARLIE
Sandy was an alcoholic.
SHERRI
No-no-no. You thought she was an
alcoholic. She just drank more than
you drank. What about Jill?
CHARLIE
She hated my family.
SHERRI
You thought she hated your family.
Nobody hates your family. Everybody
loves your family. What about Julie?
CHARLIE
She smelled like soup.
SHERRI
What does that mean?
CHARLIE
She smelled exactly like Campbell's
Beef Vegetable soup. She was dirty,
physically dirty.
SHERRI
Well, Charlie, I wonder what you're
gonna say were my problems? Are you
gonna tell your friends that I was a
junkie, that I wasn't supportive
enough or that I smelled like relish?
Charlie, I loved you. It could have
worked out.
(she goes to the door)
Think about it.
She leaves.
ANGLE ON - THE BROKEN PICTURE
Charlie and his best friend, TONY SPILETTI, are out for a
night on the town.
Tony is second generation Italian-American with very
Mediterranean features. They're listening to Teenage Fan
Club. They pass Ghierardeli Square.
CHARLIE
Tony, Teenage Fan Club, they're
Scottish you know?
TONY
Oh.
CHARLIE
I had that dream again.
TONY
Oh, is that the one where you suspect
that a fat man in a diaper, on a
lazy susan has interfered with your
plans for the evening?
CHARLIE
No, but I have had that one. No, in
this one I'm in love...
TONY
Yeah.
CHARLIE
And I say to myself, 'I've finally
found somebody that I'm truly
comfortable with.' You know when
you're so comfortable that you'll
let them put makeup on you to see
what you would look like if you were
a girl. Anyways you know what I do
in the dream next?
TONY
You propose?
CHARLIE
(after a pause)
No. I die.
TONY
But Charlie, you're a normal suburban
guy at heart, from a normal suburban
family. Didn't you tell me you always
wanted to get married and have a
family.
CHARLIE
Yes, but, I'm afraid, okay? There
are seven main rites of passage in a
man's life. Birth, first day of
school, last day of school. Marriage.
Kids. Retirement. Death. I'm at
marriage. I'm two rites of passage
away from death.
TONY
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
Tony is doing three-sixties, scoping out beauties, when
suddenly his roving eyes lock on a police car directly behind
them. He slouches down into his seat.
TONY
Christ. It's the cops.
CHARLIE
Tony, you are a cop.
TONY
I know. Isn't it awful? I work with
those guys. They're assholes.
The police car passes.
Charlie is driving in his car. He drives slowly looking for
an address. Finds it, slips in to a parking spot in front.
Adorning the front are a "GRAND OPENING" sign and miniature
flags of the world. Charlie goes inside.
Charlie is driving along listening to Kerouac. We absorb the
flavor of San Francisco as he drives down Lombard Street.
An old crappie apartment building in San Francisco. Charlie's
car pulls up. We hear "SATURDAY NIGHT" by the Bay City
Rollers.
Charlie's drives by and notices Harriet, who's unwinding the
store awning in Dutch national costume. The banner announces
"DUTCH WEEK." "MEATS OF THE WORLD SALUTES DUTCH MEAT."
Charlie slows down to look at her. She looks great in her
little Dutch costume.
Charlie's car pulls up. The sign reads, "WELSH WEEK" "MEATS
OF THE WORLD SALUTES WELSH MEATS"
Charlie and Harriet are eating hot-dogs. As Charlie puts the
relish on, he smells the relish.
CHARLIE
(sniffing the relish)
This reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.
HARRIET
I hate talking about old
relationships.
CHARLIE
Then let's not and say we did.
HARRIET
(she laughs)
That was easy -- What a nice guy.
You've probably never done a mean
thing in your life.
CHARLIE
You'd be surprised.
HARRIET
I'd like to hear.
(to his confused look)
Name me something bad you've done in
your life.
CHARLIE
Are you kidding me?
HARRIET
No. Did you ever steal anything? You
ever hit someone?
CHARLIE
Well, I've been in fights. Let me
think.
HARRIET
(as Charlie thinks)
Not one bad thing, Charlie?
CHARLIE
Tell me something bad you've done.
And it better be bad. I mean, evil.
HARRIET
How evil?
CHARLIE
Really evil.
(thinks)
Like how many people have you brutally
murdered?
HARRIET
"Brutal" is such a subjective word.
I mean, what's brutal to one person
might be totally reasonable to
another.
Next to them is a German couple, speaking German, looking
through a coin-operated binocular. He says something which
causes her to cry.
CHARLIE
This just reminded her of that scene
in "Brian's Song".
HARRIET
Actually, he just proposed to her.
Those are tears of joy.
She lifts her soda to toast them.
HARRIET
Prost.
The man and woman smile and nod.
MAN
Danke, Fraulein.
CHARLIE
You're very smart. It's a shame I'm
going to have to destroy you.
HARRIET
Do bright women intimidate you?
CHARLIE
No, not at all.
HARRIET
Really, what do you look for in women
you date?
CHARLIE
(thinks)
Well, I know everyone always say
"sense of humor", but I'd have to go
with breast size.
(she laughs)
How about you? In a guy.
HARRIET
Income of course, and then...
(thinks)
...savings.
He smiles at her.
CHARLIE
Me likey how you thinkey.
Tony and Charlie are waiting in line.
AERIAL VIEW OF BOAT
as they travel to the island.
TONY (V.O.)
You know I've lived in this city all
my life and I've never been to
Alcatraz.
ALCATRAZ
We open on the LOUD BANGING of a CELL DOOR. We find our tour
group in the holding area. The PARK RANGER is a beefy man in
his late fifties and talks with emotionless, military
precision.
PARK RANGER
Hello, everyone I'm a park ranger
and I will be leading you on the
tour. All the park rangers here at
Alcatraz were at one time guards,
myself included. My name is John
Johnson, but everyone here calls me
Vicki. Will you please follow me?
They are led out. We see that Alcatraz is a sinister place.
Cold and unforgiving. The Park Ranger leads them to the center
of a cell block.
TONY
You're glowing, Charlie. The man's
in love.
CHARLIE
Sssh... Stop it. I'm trying to listen.
PARK RANGER
This is the main cell block area.
Home to such famous criminals as Al
Capone, Micky Cohen, Joseph "Dutch"
Critzer, and Robert Stroud, the famous
Bird Man of Alcatraz. Follow me,
please.
The Park Ranger leads them past the famous visiting rooms,
the mess hall, all the way to the solitary confinement area.
A CELL
PARK RANGER
This is the cell for solitary
confinement, that over the years has
come to be known as Times Square.
Tony and Charlie are at the back of the tour group.
TONY
So did you and Harriet?... you know...
CHARLIE
(grinning)
Sssh I don't want to talk about it.
TONY
With that look, you don't have to
talk about it. The grin alone could
get you five to seven years.
CHARLIE
Tony, get your mind out of the gutter.
All you need to know is that she's a
sweet, kind and loving person.
PARK RANGER
Now this is something none of the
other tour guides will tell you. In
this particular cell block Machine
Gunn Kelly had, what we call in the
prison system, a "bitch." And one
day, in a jealous rage, Kelly took a
makeshift knife, or "shiv," and cut
out his "bitch's" eyes.
CHARLIE
Look, what can I tell you. I'm
smitten. I'm in deep smit. I dunno.
I just don't wanna talk about it,
because then I start analyzing and
that's not good for me.
TONY
Good. I think that's good. Just let
it happen.
CHARLIE
Exactly. That's what's gonna be
different this time. Something strange
happens, let it go. It's not my
business... Like Ralph. She says
Ralph in her sleep.
TONY
Who's Ralph?
CHARLIE
I don't know who Ralph is. Moreover,
I don't want to know.
TONY
Good.
PARK RANGER
And as if blinding his "bitch" wasn't
enough retribution for Kelly, the
next day he and four other inmates
took turns pissing into the "bitch's"
ocular cavity.
Tony and Charlie look at each other. They're a little queasy.
CHARLIE
Exactly.
(beat)
Tony, I'm happy. Don't let me screw
this one up.
Charlie enters the building, holding a handful of poetry
books. He passes a UNIFORMED DELIVERY GUY coming out. The
guy nods and Charlie nods back.
Charlie and Harriet wait in line with bohemian types and
poetry lovers from the suburbs, and all walks of life.
Directly behind them are TWO OLD LADIES. The marquee reads:
"POETRY FESTIVAL - TONIGHT ALLEN GINSBERG."
CHARLIE
I think you're going to love Alan
Ginsberg. He's great.
HARRIET
Oh, I know all about him.
TONY (O.S.)
Hey Charlie!
Tony is getting out of a cab accompanied by Susan, the girl
from Spiletti's Coffee House. He approaches Charlie.
TONY
Sorry we're late.
Tony throws his arms wide open and hugs one of the Little
Old Ladies on the other side of Charlie.
TONY
You must be Harriet. I've heard a
lot about you.
CHARLIE
(to Tony; re: Harriet)
This is Harriet.
TONY
Oh. Sorry. Of course.
(whispering to Harriet)
I apologize. Charlie described you
as much older. And heavier.
HARRIET
(smiling)
Oh, he did...?
CHARLIE
Thank you, Tony. This is my best
friend.
TONY
And this is Susan. Charlie, you
remember her from Uncle Giuseppi's.
CHARLIE
Yes, I do.
SUSAN
You're funny...
Then she GIGGLES. The girls start inside, Tony lags back
with Charlie.
TONY
(whispers to Charlie)
I give Susan one night.
The four of them walk along the wharf. Charlie is at one of
those arcade games where you throw bean bags at the puppets
and try and knock them down. Charlie knocks two down.
ARCADE MAN
One more and you get your pick.
CHARLIE
(to Harriet)
You do it.
HARRIET
No, Charlie. I'm the worst.
TONY
Come on, you'll be great...
The arcade man turns around to watch. Harriet winds up and
throws the bean bag directly into his neck.
ARCADE MAN
Hey!
HARRIET
Sorry... I told you Charlie.
CHARLIE
No, no, you're okay, you're just
having control problems.
They both start laughing. He puts his arm around her. In the
b.g. the wounded arcade man is being led away by a co-worker.
They continued down the boardwalk stand in front of a House
of Horrors.
It looks somewhat run down and Harriet looks questioningly
at Charlie.
CHARLIE
I know this is really, really cheesy,
but in a way this is one of the places
in San Francisco I'm most proud of.
HARRIET
Yeah, let's go in.
Tony nods agreement. Susan looks bored. They go inside the
HOUSE OF HORRORS
it's as low rent as Charlie described. The "KEEPER OF THE
THRESHOLD" so described in a poorly written sign, is an
overweight man in his late twenties, wearing jeans and a
denim jacket and a little bit of scary makeup. He looks like
a roadie for the band, KISS. He stands at a podium, smoking
and reading a paper. As Charlie, Tony, Harriet and Susan
pass the Threshold Keeper, he takes a casual drag of his
cigarette, lets out a little smoke and with zero commitment
utters:
THRESHOLD KEEPER
Boo.
Pouring rain. THUNDER. Charlie and Harriet, wrapped in each
others arms, walking through the rain.
HARRIET
I feel so safe with you right now.
You're never going to leave me, are
you? I feel like I could be here
forever.
CUT TO:
TIGHT SHOT OF RAIN HITTING CHARLIE'S PANIC-STRICKEN FACE
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
THE REFLECTION OF RAIN ON CHARLIE'S PANIC-STRICKEN FACE
PULL BACK to see Charlie in bed. He lies awake on his side,
his back up to Harriet's. She is sound asleep. Suddenly:
HARRIET
(sleeptalking)
Ralph! No, Ralph!
Charlie sighs, then just shrugs and tries to fall asleep.
What can he do.
FADE IN:
Charlie stands outside the announcement office, terrified.
Charlie is exiting a vintage record store. Suddenly he finds
himself face to face with Sherri. She's accompanied by a
handsome young man.
SHERRI
Hey, Charlie.
CHARLIE
Hi. How're you doing.
(he glances at her
friend)
Good, huh?
SHERRI
I'm okay. This is Michael. Michael,
this is Charlie MacKenzie.
YOUNG GUY
I know. Why don't you two talk. I'm
going over there to buy some
magazines.
He walks over to a magazine stand.
CHARLIE
That good looking and he can read!
SHERRI
I'm teaching him. I heard you have a
new girlfriend.
CHARLIE
We broke up. There were problems.
SHERRI
Problems?
CHARLIE
Difficulties.
SHERRI
Let me guess...
(smiles)
She's a murderer.
For a moment, Charlie is too stunned to respond. Then...
CHARLIE
Why did you just say that?
SHERRI
(laughs)
What else is left?
Charlie races along towards Harriet's house.
He races up to the door and starts to bang and knock and
ring...
CHARLIE
(through door)
Harriet, it's me, Charlie.
HARRIET (O.S.)
Go away, Charlie.
CHARLIE
I've gotta talk to you, cause I miss
you, and I made a mistake... and if
you give me another chance I'll
change. I will. I promise. I'll get
help, or therapy, or... Yeah, that'll
be great. Therapy. Even twice a week.
I'll check with my insurance to see
if I'm covered, but forget that.
Harriet...
The chain opens on the door.
HARRIET
You really hurt me.
CHARLIE
I'll make it up to you, can we at
least talk.
HARRIET
Sure, talk.
Rose steps up behind Charlie.
ROSE (O.S.)
Hi, Charlie.
CHARLIE
AAAhhhhhh.
ROSE
(as she now proceeds
to be let in by
Harriet)
Trust your first instincts, Charlie.
You never do. It's your big mistake.
That and the haircut.
Once again, baffled by Rose, Charlie touches his hair, shakes
it off and looks Harriet right in the eye.
CHARLIE
I don't want to lose you.
HARRIET
You didn't lose me. You rejected me.
CHARLIE
I'm unrejecting you.
HARRIET
How do I know you won't reject me
again?
CHARLIE
I love you.
HARRIET
(after a long pause)
I love you. But you blew it, Charlie,
you blew it.
She goes into the house. Charlie stands there dejected. He
knows he's blown it.
Harriet rushes out and smiles as she sees the source of the
noise. Charlie serenades Harriet in the street below,
accompanied by a TRUMPETER with a MUTE, a DOUBLE BASS PLAYER
AND A GUY ON A SNARE.
CHARLIE
HARRIET, HARRIET HARD-HEARTED
HARBINGER OF HAGGIS
BEAUTIFUL, BEMUSED BELLICOSE BUTCHER
UNTRUST-ING
UNKNOW-ING
UNLOV-ING
HE WANTS YOU BACK HE SCREAMS INTO
THE NIGHT AIR LIKE A FIREMAN GOING
TO A WINDOW THAT HAS NO FIRE EXCEPT
THE PASSION OF HIS HEART
I AM LONELY,
IT'S REALLY HARD
THIS POEM SUCKS
A crowd has gathered in the street and spectators group on
their balconies. They break out into APPLAUSE. Charlie proudly
takes the applause and bows to Harriet. She throws him a
flower. He's won her back.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Wait 'til you see this place, Harriet.
Tony hurries to his car.
They stop at a gas station with a small mini-mart. As Charlie
is filling the tank he notices Harriet slipping the key out
of the ignition before she walks to the mini-mart for more
food.
HARRIET
You want anything?
CHARLIE
Lamb chops, creamed spinach, stuffed
tomatoes and a Hershey Bar.
Harriet arrives at the little Ma and Pa type mini-mart and
smiles to Charlie.
CHARLIE
If they don't have all that, I'll
just take the Hershey bar.
Tony stands at the door, buzzing the buzzer to no response.
A beautiful old Colonial Mansion, nestled in the mountains
and forests of the North-West. Romantic and from another
day. Charlie and Harriet pull up in front of it.
The Valets open the door for them.
HARRIET
It's like a castle, Charlie. It's so
beautiful.
VALET
Welcome to the Dry Creek. You just
beat the rainstorm. Two hours later
and the roads'd probably be closed.
CHARLIE
Great. If you could help us with the
luggage, we have these two in the
back seat and...
As they deal with the luggage, Harriet starts to walk away
from the hotel, away from the car, rain falling on her head.
She walks straight at the CAMERA, so only we can see her
expression. Her expression is one of simply "losing it".
CHARLIE
Harriet? What are you doing honey?
Harriet turns around and smiles at Charlie. He smiles back.
A small plane flies through the clouds. It's just Tony and
DENNIS the pilot.
Dennis never really realizes this is more than a sightseeing
tour, and constantly points out scenic points along the way.
DENNIS
Out your left side, you can see the
Sierra Nevada, which is the largest
mountain range west of the Rockies...
TONY
Great. Rockies. I don't care. Oregon.
Move.
The plane descends towards the runway. The rain comes down
hard.
DENNIS (V.O.)
As we prepare to land, we can see
off to our left Lake Shanony, which
is...
TONY (V.O.)
Just land. Don't worry about Lake
Shanony. I don't give a shit about
Lake Shanony.
The plane touches down.
Rain pours fantastically on the gothic castle. Wind blows
hard.
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
A toast to our new friends, Charlie
and Harriet...
Tony runs out of the airport terminal where he sees a man in
his forties who's just entered his four wheel drive jeep.
TONY
(flashing his badge)
Excuse me, Sir, I'm with the San
Francisco Police Department. I'm on
official business and I'm afraid I
have to commandeer your vehicle.
MAN
(unfazed)
No.
TONY
What do you mean no?!
MAN
I happen to know for a fact that you
don't have the power to commandeer
my vehicle.
TONY
This is true.
(pause)
Please can I commandeer your vehicle?
MAN
Well, where are you going?
TONY
To The Dry Creek Lodge.
MAN
I'll give you a lift.
TONY
Well, I don't want a lift, I really
want to commandeer the vehicle. Please
just let me commandeer the vehicle.
MAN
Why don't you just let me drive you
there? Really, I don't mind, it's on
my way.
(pause)
TONY
You're not going to bend on the
commandeering thing are you?
MAN
No.
TONY
Well, if we get stopped will you at
least let me say that I commandeered
the vehicle, but I let you drive?
MAN
I'm uncomfortable with that.
TONY
Please?
MAN
All right.
Charlie tightropes along the ledge of the building. The storm
continues. Rose comes out on the ledge and starts to chase
him. He rounds the bend. Charlie looks into one room and
sees MR. & MRS. LEVENSTEIN there. There's loud OPERA MUSIC
playing in the room
CHARLIE
Call the police!
Charlie races along the slippery ledge, almost falling at
several points. Rose then appears on the roof holding the
Axe, still.
ROSE
(mostly to herself;
slurring most words)
Charlie, did you like your note? I
thought it was pretty accurate. I
did all the husbands' notes. I can
forge anyone's handwriting, I can
write in anyone's style. See, I'm an
artist. Harriet isn't an artist.
Sure she could get a husband, but
she could never have done this. And
you know what I'm most proud of?
CHARLIE
What's that, Rose?
ROSE
Harriet never knew. She thought they
all just left her. I protected her.
She's my sister.
Charlie turns and runs. Rose chases him.
