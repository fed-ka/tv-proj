To pop everything into place...    

use Courier 10 (or 10 characters per inch)

set top margin at 0.4", bottom margin at 0.4" (or minimums)
left margin at 1", right margin at .25 (or minimum)
   (I had to tell the program I was using legal paper)

page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

regular tabs, hard returns and right flushes are used 
to position things to look as much like original as possible

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at the end
of the lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because it's easier

logo on front page will be noted when used but not included here

as this may be sent in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

I don't know what the (X) or the * (this on Cast, Locations and
Chronology pages) designate.

   2  INT. CLARK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT #1                               2   

      LOIS CLONE, breathtaking in her beautiful nightgown, stands
      watching Clark, who's in bed.  CLARK, all but panting, 
      smiles and:

                                      CLARK
                     You know, I have... imagined this
                     moment... For so long.

      He pulls back covers to make a space for her.  She smiles,
      approaches. outside, a soft roll of THUNDER.

                                      CLARK (CONT'D)
                     Hello, Mrs. Kent.

      She gets into bed, he moves in close, kisses her.

                                      CLARK (CONT'D)
                     We've gone through so much to get 
                     to this night, but none of that 
                     matters.  It's perfect.

                     He starts to kiss her again.

                     preparations... The wedding... I'm

      She rolls on her side, facing CAMERA.  A roll of THUNDER.

      limousine rolls up to an abandoned tenement.  The car's rear
      door opens, and the Church Deacon from last episode climbs
      out.  He looks inside the car, addresses someone we can't
      yet see.

      Lois Clone, in robe, dabs at her mouth with a napkin, 
      glances hungrily in her purse as if it were a candy box, 
      selects another frog, pulls it out, prepared to munch, when:

                     Lois... you out there?

      She instantly stuffs the frog back in her purse, shuts it, 
      and whips around, assuming an innocent pose as Clark, 
      pulling on robe, comes out of the bedroom.

                                      CLARK (CONT'D)
                     Hi.

                     Hi.  Would you like coffee?
                           (crosses to kitchen)
                     I know you like coffee.  It's one 
                     of the many, many things I know 
                     about you.

                                      CLARK
                     Uh, great.  Could we talk about

                                      CLARK
                     Yeah well, depending on how you
                     define 'warm.'

                                      LOIS CLONE
                           (crossly; staring into

                     Where are the cups?  Where are the
                     cups?!  Where are they?!

                                      CLARK
                           (yikes)
                     To your right.  We changed 'em
                     around.  Two weeks ago.  Remember?

                                      LOIS CLONE
                     Of course I remember.  Why wouldn't 
                     I?  To the right, you say?

      She flings open the cupboard.

      Lois Clone, remembering her mission, softens and scoots over 
      to him with a cup of coffee.

      Clark enters with a bag of groceries.  The door hits some
      clothing and shoe boxes as it opens.  He stares, then comes
      inside, staring at a room piled with new clothes (with tags
      on), shopping bags, empty boxes.  A beat, then:

                     Hi!  I've had the best day!

      And she comes out of the bedroom.  Clark is startled to see 
      she's dressed in a kind of trashy teen-age style, with 
      incredibly short skirt, thigh-high stockings, tight top, 
      tags flapping.

                     Sure!  I opened charge accounts at
                     about twenty stores!
                           (as his mouth falls open)
                     Well, it wasn't _my_ idea.  _They_ 
                     asked _me_.  I am very well thought 
                     of in this town.  Aw please don't 
                     be a drag, I've spent all _day_ 
                     doing this!  It's hard work!

                     happy, it makes me happy.

      He gives her a quick kiss, crosses to kitchen.  Behind his 
      back, Lois Clone makes a bit of a face at having kissed him.

                     I did some shopping, too.  I 
                     thought I'd whip up some dinner... 
                     Crack open a bottle-of wine... You

                     castigation at your hands?  Because
                     in a few hours we'll be sealed in
                     my fortress in the Alps.  You'd be
                     Surprised, Lois my love, at how
                     incarceration can change a person.
                     Look at me.

                     Hardly.  You see, once my name and 
                     character were branded criminal, 
                     my outcast status allowed the true

      There's a rattling at the door and JONATHAN and MARTHA let
      themselves in.  They're carrying piles of gift-wrapped boxes 
      which they stack in Clark's apartment.

                     I had $200 million dollars just 
                     sitting around all this time and 
                     never knew it?

                     withdraw it?  Who'll get your blood

      The door opens and Lois Clone climbs in, sits in the seat 
      opposite them.

                     successful marriage.

      Distant ship HORNS; tug WHISTLES. A seedy street near the

      Inside, someone's singing.

      A colorful dive loaded with mementos of Bibbo's colorful
      life.  Tough ex-prizefighter and current bar owner BIBBO
      BIBOWSKI, late 40's, sits at a table with Red, watching the
      O.S. singer.  Chairs are atop tables; a few diehards drink
      at the bar; a busboy mops the floor.

                                      BIBBO

      that serves as a stage, backed by a guy at an upright piano.
      Wanda finishes, sashays overland in her gravelly voice:

                     Lois Lane?  I'm a girl who gets 
                     what she wants, and what I want is 
                     Clark.

                     this relationship.  You are the

                           (then)
                     Kent, you must hate me with more 
                     hate than you thought possible.  
                     But there's a larger issue.  The 
                     Clone's gotten it into her head to 
                     destroy Lois.

                                      CLARK
                     What?

                     Replicants are quite childish,
                     always throwing tantrums...
                           (nods to the room)
                     ... as you can see.  Well, she's
                     decided she wants you and has to
                     eliminate the competition.
                           (pulls down coat to
                            reveal his bloody sleeve)
                     I guarantee she means business.

      Clark grabs Lex by the shirt front, yanks him to his feet, 
      grabs a phone, dials.

      The SUPER WHOOSH outside swings open the door, scattering 
      napkins, and knocking over a bottle.  Then Clark enters.
      Inside, he notices an easel next to the piano. on it is a 
      photo of Lois, under which is written "Tonight - Wanda
      Detroit."  He approaches the bar.

                     Lois, what're you talking about?                (X)

                                      WANDA
                     Clark, we've been saved from a                  (X)
                     horrible mistake.                               (X)

                     Getting married.                                (X)

      Clark just stares in horror; Wanda goes on as if repeating     (X)
      memorized lines.                                               (X)

                     I had doubts. I was afraid to                   (X)
                     disappoint you... our parents...                (X)
                     I couldn't even face you.  That's               (X)
                     why I hid out here... pretending to
                     be Wanda.  The truth is, I'm not                (X)
                     made for marriage.  I need to go
                     away and sort things out.                       (X)

                                      CLARK
                     Go... where?                                    (X)

                           (moving toward her)
                     Lois, you don't mean this. What                 (X)
                     about me?                                       (X)

                     I _don't_ love you.                             (X)

                     love me as much as you say you do,
                     you'll let me go!                               (X)

      He's stunned; she turns and heads back to the other side of    (X)
      the car, as:

                     Tough break, old man. Well, I hope
                     you'll handle it with dignity.

                                      CLARK

      Clark grabs Lex's arm.                                         (X)

                            himself; to Lex)
                     I don't know yet what you've done               (X)
                     to her, but I will find you. And I
                     will bring Lois back.  And if I
                     have to go right through you to do
                     it, I will. I promise you.

      Wanda glares at Clark.  Lex wrenches free.                     (X)

                                      LEX
                     Why, that sounds like a threat,
                     Clark.  My woman doesn't take
                     kindly to threats.

      He smiles, jumps in the car, hits the gas, takes off up the
      street.  We are shooting over Clark's back as the Clone        (X)
      enters FRAME, sidles up to him.

      He stares over at her as CAMERA CRANES UP, leaving Clark and
