      MACLEOD and DAWSON are leaning against the bar as CASSANDRA
      sits at a nearby table in front of Dawson's LAPTOP.  She's
      paging through the files of Immortal after Immortal from the
      Watcher Database.  Their images flip by.

                                      DAWSON
                    You really think the other Horsemen
                    could still be alive?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Methos and Kronos are.  Under
                    different names, different lives.

      Cassandra pushes the laptop away from her impatiently.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    This is pointless.  We're wasting
                    time.  Let's just go find Kronos.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Starting where?

                    If they are alive, that's where he'll
                    be going.

                                      DAWSON
                    I've narrowed the search down to
                    white, male Immortals we don't have
                    First Death information on.
                          (beat)
                    It's still a helluva lot of files.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Try narrowing it down by name.  Look
                    for something similar to what they
                    were using then.  Caspian and Silas.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're reaching.

                    Just try it, okay?

      He catches himself and, as an apology:

                    C'mon, Joe.  It's worth a shot.

      Dawson hits a few keys on the laptop and a few names and
      pictures appear.

                                      DAWSON
                    Andrew Kaspis.

                            head)
                    Evan Casparri.

      As EVAN CASPARRI appears on the screen, a paleness washes
      over Cassandra's face.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (in a tiny voice)
                    That's him.... that's Caspian.

      lean over Cassandra's shoulder to check out the file.

                                      DAWSON
                    He's in Romania.  Just outside
                      Bucharest.
                          (beat)
                    In an asylum for the criminally

                    Let's go.

      MacLeod turns from the laptop screen to see that Cassandra
      is already half way out the door.


      Methos and Kronos are standing at the reception desk talking
      to DR. CERNAVODA, the asylum's administrator.  Silas stands
      there, mute.  Dr. Cernavoda is studying some official-looking
      documents.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    This is a highly irregular request. 
                    It will take weeks, perhaps months.

                                      METHOS
                    We'd like him...
                          (beat)
                    Now.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    We have procedures, gentlemen.
                          (gently chiding)
                    Patience is a virtue.
                          (beat)
                    I'm afraid my hands are tied.

                                      KRONOS
                          (leaning in close)
                    Perhaps this could help untie them.

      Kronos pulls out a thick envelope and hands it to Dr.
      Cernavoda.  As Dr. Cernavoda opens it and looks inside --

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                      Twenty-five thousand dollars...
                    U.S.
                          (persuasive smile)
                    Now it seems to me you have a
                      "procedural" choice to make, Doctor. 
                    Forget your impeccable paperwork and
                    I give you twenty-five thousand
                    dollars and you give me Casparri, or
                    you keep Casparri and lose everything.
                          (beat; with implied
                            danger)
                    I do mean everything.

      It's an easy choice.  The Doctor nods and puts the envelope
      inside his smock.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    This way.
                          (beat)
                      Gentlemen.


      The place is decaying, a warehouse of the unfortunate.  The
      corridors are lined with barred doors, some open, but most
      are closed and locked.

      As Dr. Cernavoda leads Methos, Kronos, and Silas through the
      corridors, some of the inmates watch them through eyes full
      of sedation.  Others, through eyes full of madness.  Some
      reach out through barred doors.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    What are you going to do with
                    Casparri?

                      Rehabilitate him.

      Dr. Cernavoda laughs.  The others don't.  Cernavoda looks at
      them curiously.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    You're serious?
                          (peering at Kronos)
                    You can't be serious.

                                      METHOS
                    Why?
                          (genuinely curious)
                    What did he do?

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    No one knows how many he killed. 
                    They found parts in his garden, in
                    his basement...
                          (a shudder)
                    In his freezer.

                                      METHOS
                    I'm surprised he wasn't executed.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    In a less progressive age, a man
                    like this would have been.
                          (beat)
                    Today we are more humane.

      ANGLE - ONE OF THE INMATES

      He's dressed in a ragged black gown.  He points in horror as
      he sees Kronos.

                                      INMATE
                    He's here!  The Dark One is here!
                          (points a craggy finger
                          at Kronos)
                    It's you!  It's the END!

      Kronos fixes the inmate with a dark smile.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                          (to Kronos)
                    Pay no attention.  He's harmless. 
                    He's been saying that for thirty
                    years.

                                      KRONOS
                    One day he may be right.

                    And one day Romania will be a
                      superpower.

      Dr. Cernavoda stops at a heavily barred room.

      ANGLE - CASPARRI'S ROOM

      Caspian is chained to the stone wall.  He's doing rapid push
      ups, arm-chains rattling and clanging.  He's matted and
      filthy.  As he gets the BUZZ, he goes into a feral crouch.

                                      METHOS
                    Very humane.

      Dr. Cernavoda gives Methos a sardonic look.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    I don't know what you want him for,
                    but believe me...
                          (beat)
                    This one is better off dead.

                                      KRONOS
                    Open the door.

      After a look from Kronos, Silas stands vigil in the hallway.

      As Cernavoda turns a key in the lock and opens the door --


      The door opens and Caspian springs forward, but is brought
      up short by his chain, like a lunging dog.  He falls back
      against the wall, panting and snarling.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    Are you sure you don't want to
                    consider another candidate?

                                      KRONOS
                    Unchain him.

      Caspian lunges again.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    Perhaps we should call security.

      Kronos' sword is out in an instant.  The chain is severed in
      a single blow.  Suddenly Caspian lunges and grasps the
      Doctor's throat in a powerful death grip.

      As Cernavoda struggles, trying to pry Caspian's fingers from
      his throat, Kronos looks on with something akin to amusement.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96512    "Revelation 6:8"     9.    Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

                                    DR. CERNAVODA (CONT'D)
                    Get him off me!

                                      KRONOS
                    And I thought you valued patience.

      There's a beat.  Kronos locks eyes with Caspian.  Caspian
      smiles and Cernavoda dies.  (NOTE: Please make sure we have
      Methos' reaction so that we can be on him as Cernavoda is
      killed for the European version.)

      As Cernavoda crumbles to the ground, Kronos takes the cash
      from his pocket.  A smile of mad delight spreads over
      Caspian's face --

      Methos steps forward.

                                      CASPIAN
                    Stop!

      Methos stops.  Caspian reaches down where Methos was about
      to step.  There is a large black bug.  He picks it up and
      pops it in his mouth.

                                      CASPIAN (CONT'D)
                    They're better alive.

                                      METHOS
                    Bon apetit.

                                      KRONOS
                    Come, we have much to do.

      Kronos and Caspian move out of the cell.  Methos lingers a
      moment.  We see that SOMETHING SMALL falls from Methos  hand. 
      Methos doesn't pick it up.  He gives the room one last glance
      and heads out the grated door, pulling it closed hard behind
      him.


      MacLeod and Cassandra are at the reception desk in
        conversation with a distraught NURSE.  A gurney is wheeling
      out the dead Dr. Cernavoda.

                                      NURSE
                    Some time last night.  We found the
                    doctor this morning.

                    Let's go.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Did Casparri have any visitors
                      yesterday?

      The Nurse picks up a chart.

                                      NURSE
                    No... there's nothing on his chart.

      The Nurse looks up and sees TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMEN
        approaching.

                                      NURSE (CONT'D)
                    Excuse me.

      She walks off toward the police.  MacLeod lifts up the chart
      and moves down the corridor.  Cassandra hesitates.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    C'mon.


      MacLeod opens the door to Casparri s room.  Cassandra is
      clearly irritated.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Kronos and Methos already have him. 
                    Why are we wasting time in this
                    hellhole?

      MacLeod is silent, looks around.  He picks up the severed
      chain and studies  it.

      Drops it, and then his eye catches something small in the
      folds of the chain.  He picks it up.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Here's why.

      INSERT - A MATCHBOOK.

      Imprinted with the JOE'S LOGO.   MacLeod opens it, reads

                    Methos left it.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    The question is why.

                                      MACLEOD,
                          (beat)
                    You think he s setting us up.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Don't you?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    But we're going anyway?

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's the only place we've been
                    invited.

      As they walk out of the room, they smile with practiced
      nonchalance at the two entering POLICEMEN.


      The WAR ROOM is a huge hall, nearly empty except for a wooden
      table set at the center.  Around the table sit Methos and
      Caspian.  Caspian s been cleaned up but still has a wild
      animal look to him.  Silas enters.

                                      SILAS
                    What the hell is this place?  Where
                    are the stables?  Where are the
                    horses?  How can we ride?

                                      CASPIAN
                    Where ve you been for two thousand
                    years, Silas?  Living in a cave?
                          (with a mocking laugh)
                    You think we can just mount up and
                    gallop down Broadway?

                                      SILAS
                    We can do whatever we please, like
                    always.

                                      CASPIAN
                    Right.  Four guys on Horseback in
                    wild masks -- they'll think we're in
                    the circus.

                                      SILAS
                          (his hand on his ax)
                    They won't think it for long.

                                      CASPIAN
                          (chortles)
                    You're crazy.  You should have been
                    in the madhouse instead of me.

                                      SILAS
                    Keep laughing, I'll send you back
                    there headless.

      Caspian is up to the challenge, rises, drawing his sword as
      he does.  Silas is on his feet, ax ready.

      From his seat, Methos seems to be enjoying this well enough.

      Kronos enters, his sword in hand.

                                      KRONOS
                    Put them down.

      They hesitate.  Suddenly the sword slams down into the wooden
      table, shaking it.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Do it... now.

      They do as ordered.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                          (chilling)
                    We never raise a blade against each
                    other.
                          (turns to Methos)
                    Isn't that right, Methos?

                                      METHOS
                    You said it.

                                      CASPIAN
                          (to Kronos re Silas)
                    Then you tell him he's an idiot.

                                      KRONOS
                    Why?  For dreaming?  For knowing in
                    his heart what we were?  What we
                    still are.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    We are the Four Horsemen.  No band
                    of men have ever been more cruel or
                    more feared.  Remember that.

      He takes Caspian's hand in his, takes Silas' hand in his
      other hand.  Brings them together.  Silas and Caspian clasp
      hands.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Silas, my brother, why would we want
                    to ride with swords and axes when
                    today there are weapons of
                      unimaginable power?

      Methos  expression is schooled.

                                      METHOS
                    Waiting to plunge the world into
                      generations of darkness.

                                      KRONOS
                    If we choose.
                          (relishing the moment)
                    What more could we ask for?  What
                    better time to come together than in
                    the scientific age?
                          (with passion and a
                            touch of madness)
                    Think of what men like us can do. 
                    Men without conscience, without
                    fear... Think of the destruction,
                    the devastation... the death... a
                    world of anarchy and madness.
                          (beat)
                    And dream!


      Inside a large room is filled with cages.  Most are empty,
      but many contain MONKEYS.  The Horsemen enter.  The monkeys
      chatter.

                                      KRONOS
                    The weapons of today are different,
                    but it all comes down to the same
                    thing.  There are the conquerers and
                    there are the conquered.

                                      CASPIAN
                          (as a wise ass)

                    Not with them.  With this.

      Kronos opens a small insulated container.  With a pair of
      tongs he removes a vial.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)

                    die.  A week later, a thousand... a
                    month later a million.
                          (beat)
                    Were you in England when the plague
                    hit, Caspian?  I was.

                    You have a plan?

      Kronos smiles.

                                      KRONOS
                    I have a few thoughts.  A few dollars. 
                    Enough to start.

                    Now that we've found Methos... Now
                    we'll have a plan.

                                      METHOS
                    What did you have in mind?

                                      KRONOS
                    Once we rode out of the sun, bringing
                    death at the point of a sword.  There
                    was no man, and no Immortal, who
                    could stand before us.  We were death
                    on horseback.  They called us the
                    end of the world.

      Kronos' eyes are manic as he rakes them over his compatriots.

      FADE IN:


      Mid-scene.  Methos sits with his feet up on the table, a
      study in casualness.  Silas leans on the wall nearby while
      Caspian is doing pushups, showing off.  Kronos paces in front
      of Methos.

                                      KRONOS
                    That's it?  A bomb with the virus in
                      a fountain?  How many will that kill?
                          (beat)
                    You've gone soft, Methos.

                                      CASPIAN
                          (with sarcasm)
                    I'm scared...
                          (to Silas)
                    Are you scared?

                                      METHOS
                    It's a beginning.  Haven't you read
                      Aristotle's Poetics?
                          (off Caspian's look)
                    Of course not.  Don't suppose you've
                    seen "Casablanca," either.
                          (with a sigh)
                    It's the first rule of great drama. 
                    Start small, and build.
                          (beat)
                      A fountain... to get their attention. 
                    Then a public pool, to kill a hundred. 
                    Then a stadium to kill ten thousand. 
                    Then an ounce of this in a city's
                    water supply and in a week...

      Methos' voice trails off.

                                      KRONOS
                          (liking it)
                    The city is dead.

                                      METHOS
                    You want to own the world again? 
                    You offer them the choice -- the
                    Horsemen rule, or they all die.

      Kronos smiles.

                    It begins tonight.


      An Innkeeper stands behind the front desk.  MacLeod turns
      from him, moves to Cassandra.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No message, no reservation, nothing.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He left that note, he'll get in touch.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    He's done nothing but lie to you. 
                    That's all he ever does.

      MacLeod doesn't answer her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'll get us a room.

      MacLeod turns back to the front desk.


      Silas is feeding one of the monkeys through the cage door. 
      He's smiling as it takes food from his hand.  The monkeys
      CHATTER suddenly.  He looks for the source of agitation. 
      It's Methos passing by the door.

                                      SILAS
                    Methos?  You seem troubled.

                                      METHOS
                          (entering)
                    No, I was just thinking.

                                      SILAS
                    You were always good at that.

                    I m glad after all these years that

                    Me, too.

      Silas smiles.  He offers Methos a half-pint of an amber
      liquor.

                                      SILAS
                    Not like the old days, is it?

      Methos takes a swig hands it back.

                                      SILAS
                    We were meant for battle, men like
                    us.  In an age of warlords, we were
                    kings.
                          (beat)
                    I don't like killing from a distance. 
                    I like to have my ax in my hand, to
                    see my enemies' eyes before I strike.

                                      METHOS
                    Soon enough.

                                      SILAS
                          (surprised)
                    You don't think the virus will work?

                                      METHOS
                    Oh, it'll work.
                          (beat)
                    We'll kill a hundred, then a thousand,
                    then a million.  Until Kronos gets
                    what he wants.
                          (beat)
                    He'll destroy half the world and
                    rule the rest.

                                      SILAS
                    We will rule.  We four.

      He hands Methos the bottle again.  Methos takes it, holds it
      without drinking for a beat.  Then:

                                      METHOS
                    Silas... For two thousand years we've
                    lived without it.  The blood, the
                    fear, the power.

                                      SILAS
                    And for two thousand years I've hoped
                    for the day we would ride again.
                          (beat)
                    Like you always said.  We live.  We
                    grow stronger.  And then we fight.

      A beat of silence from Methos.  Then he takes a final swig
      and hands the bottle back.

                                      METHOS
                    I'll see you later.

      He turns to leave.  Silas calls after him.

                                      SILAS
                    Do you think he'll let me have one?

                                      METHOS
                    Have what?

                                      SILAS
                    A monkey.  I like this one.

                                      METHOS
                    I'll ask him for you.

                                      SILAS
                    Thank you, brother.

      There's no response from Methos.


                                      CASSANDRA
                    Will you kill him?
                          (off no response)
                    Can you kill him?

                                      MACLEOD
                    If I have to.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You will.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Did it ever occur to you that he
                    might be trying to help us?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    No.

      The phone RINGS.  MacLeod grabs the phone.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Hello?96512    "Revelation 6:8"     20.    Final Shooting Script 10/24/96




      As MacLeod schools his face, answers casually into the now
      dead phone --

                                      MACLEOD
                          (into phone)
                    I'll be right down.

      Cassandra is acutely alert.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Was that him?

                                      MACLEOD
                    No, just the front desk -- some
                    problem with my credit card.

      As MacLeod heads out the door, Cassandra moves to the mirror,
      sits in front of it.  As she gazes with a thousand yard stare
      at her reflection --


      Methos stands dead still in the nave of the church.  He
      reacts, edgy and tense, to the BUZZ as MacLeod arrives. 
      MacLeod is chilly.  The two men hold each other's eyes for a
      long moment, then --

                                      MACLEOD
                    Well? I'm here.

                                      METHOS
                    Yes... thanks.

      MacLeod tightens.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why did you lie to me?

                                      METHOS
                    About what?

1220CONTINUED:1220

                                      MACLEOD
                    About Cassandra.  About what you
                    were.

                                      METHOS
                    I was many things.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Who are you now?

      MacLeod gives him a tired look.  Methos moves closer to
      MacLeod, edgy.

                                      METHOS
                    Why do you think I didn't tell you? 
                    I know you, MacLeod.  I knew how you
                    would react.

      Methos gives a shake of the head, a mirthless laugh.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    What I've done, you don't forgive.
                    Not in your nature.
                          (beat)
                    Just accept it.

      But MacLeod just can't let it go.  He grabs Methos by the
      arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Accept what?  That a friend I trusted
                    with my life slaughtered innocent
                    people for a few head of cattle?
                          (beat)
                    What are you going to tell me, Methos? 
                    That that's how the world was?

      Methos acknowledges a fundamental truth.

                                      METHOS
                    The world was how we made it.

      Methos turns to the altar.  After a beat:

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    She told you we burned her village,
                      slaughtered her people.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And took her prisoner.

      Methos waits for MacLeod to continue.  When MacLeod doesn't,
      he turns back to MacLeod.

      When it's clear MacLeod doesn't have anything further to
      add, Methos shakes his head sadly.

                                      METHOS
                    There's more.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      Methos enters tiredly.  Cassandra rises from the shadows and
      comes to him.  It's a different Cassandra than we have seen
      in the other Flashbacks.  She's calm, submissive, dressed
        seductively.

      She carries a brass goblet.  He takes it from her and takes
      a deep swallow.

                                      METHOS
                          (re the wine)
                    It's good.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I cooled it in the river.

      She takes his cloak and his sword, puts them aside, then
      reaches to unbuckle his leather armor.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (re his dusty state)
                    You rode far.

      He sighs tiredly as the armor comes off.

                                      METHOS
                    Yes.

      He settles back on the cushions as Cassandra gently washes
      off the mud and blood of the field, anointing his body with
      exotic oils.

      He draws her closer and begins to caress her gently.  As he
      starts to remove her gown --

      The flap of the tent is flung open.  Kronos steps into the
      tent.

      Cassandra hastily pulls her robe closed, flushing under
      Kronos' hungry stare.  With a smile, Kronos turns to Methos.

                                      KRONOS
                    My compliments, brother.  You've
                    taught her well in everything, I
                    see.

      Methos's face is inscrutable.

                                      METHOS
                    She had much to learn.

      Kronos reaches into a fruit bowl.  Takes a large bite.

                                      KRONOS
                    Seems she keeps the best fruit for
                    you.

                                      METHOS
                    It's the same as any.

      Kronos is taking in Cassandra with his eyes --

                                      KRONOS
                    Maybe it just tastes better in here.
                          (moves closer to
                            Cassandra)
                    You've made quite a prize of her.

                                      METHOS
                    She's no different than any of the
                    others.

                                      KRONOS
                    Except you seem to prefer her to all
                    others.  Why is that?  Have you grown
                    attached?

                                      METHOS
                    No.

                                      KRONOS
                    Good.  I didn't think you'd make a
                    mistake like that, brother.
                          (beat)
                    Because now it's time to share the
                    spoils of war.

      Cassandra retreats behind Methos, expecting him to defend
      her, to refuse Kronos' demand.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Methos... send him away.

      Kronos laughs and moves closer.

                                      KRONOS
                    You've left some spirit in her,
                    Methos.  I like that... After I
                    finish, maybe I'll let Caspian have
                    her.

      Kronos reaches and grabs Cassandra and pulls her from behind
      Methos.  Methos doesn't help or hinder Kronos, but merely
      steps aside and lets him take hold of Cassandra.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (in shock and terror)
                    Methos!

      No reaction.

      Cassandra screams and struggles as Kronos drags her out of
      the tent.  Her face is washed with terror and betrayal.

      HOLD ON Methos as he stares after them for a beat, face
      unreadable.  Then, as he takes a piece of fruit, and rolls
      it over in his hand --

      1229)

      The pavilion is similar in size and design to Methos 
      pavilion, but it's in disorder.  Skins and various pieces of
      booty are scattered helter-skelter throughout the pavilion.

      Cassandra is thrust inside.  Kronos stands over her.

                                      KRONOS
                    Show me again what you've learned...

      Kronos begins to open his shirt.  Cassandra shrinks back
      into a corner of the pavilion, terrified.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    No more.  I'd rather die.

                                      KRONOS
                    A little death is always at the heart
                    of passion.

      Kronos grabs Cassandra and pulls her close into him.  She
      lashes out at him, striking him hard across the face.  Without
      flinching, he throws her to the ground.

      He approaches her again.  She puts up her hands in
      supplication.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Please, don't hurt me.

      Kronos steps back and begins to untie the sash that holds up
      his trousers.

                                      KRONOS
                    Smart girl.

      Kronos smiles.  Cassandra moves closer, places her hands on
      his hips, unties the sash.  Rather than just remove his
      trousers, she takes her time, moving her hands over his lower
      abdomen, teasingly seductive.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)

                    Maybe I won't give you to Caspian
                    after all.

      Cassandra keeps caressing Kronos, moving lower.  Kronos closes
      his eyes with pleasure.

      Cassandra glances up, then in a quick fluid motion pulls a
      sharp KNIFE from her skirts.  The blade flashes.

      We are on Kronos' face as it contorts in pain.  Kronos
      staggers back.  The blade is in his chest.  He staggers and
      falls.

      Cassandra pushes past him and rushes out of the pavilion.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      Methos' face, staring straight ahead at the altar.

                                      METHOS
                    She escaped across the wilderness. 
                    She must have died a dozen times of
                    heat and thirst before she reached a
                    village that would take her in.
                          (beat)
                    And I'm sure it was worth it.  Getting
                    away from us, from me.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So what the hell are you doing with
                    Kronos now?

                                      METHOS
                    Same as always.  Trying to stay alive.
                          (beat)
                    If you want Cassandra to live, you'll
                    get her as far from here as you can.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And just let Kronos go?

      Again Methos gives a mirthless laugh.

                                      METHOS
                    That's not a choice you have.  You
                    can't stop him, I can't stop him --
                    nobody can.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And four guys with swords are going
                    to conquer the world.

                                      METHOS
                    The world doesn't change.  Not in
                    five hundred years, not in five
                    thousand.  It's only the details
                    that change.
                          (beat)
                    Kronos didn't torch villages for a
                    few coins, he torched them just to
                    see them burn.

                    Today, he'll have a nuclear bomb, or
                    a plane full of napalm... but the
                    effect will be the same.  A world of
                    people living in terror of the
                    Horsemen.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And you expect me to step aside and
                    let it happen?
                          (a beat)
                    You should know me better than that.

                                      METHOS
                    Yes.  Perhaps I do.
                          (beat)
                    What if I told you I came here to
                    warn you.  That the first step toward
                    Kronos' brave new world will be
                    tonight.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Where?  When?

                                      METHOS
                    The fountain at the Place du Vogue. 
                    At three.
                          (beat)
                    There won't be many people there
                    this time of night.

      MacLeod stares at him a beat.  He's looking at a stranger.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You set a bomb?!

                                      METHOS
                    You've heard of Ebola.  There are
                    worse things in the world if you
                    look for them.
                          (beat)
                    Kronos looked.  He's breeding a virus. 
                    He's got cages of monkeys and enough
                    virus to destroy half of Europe.
                          (beat)
                    A little bit in a fountain will only
                    kill a few, but it's a start.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What's next, the water supply?

                                      METHOS
                    Bright boy.

                    Let's go.

      He tries to move Methos out.  Methos pulls his arm away.

                                      METHOS
                    If I turn against him...
                          (beat)
                    I'll lose.

                                      MACLEOD;
                          (with  disgust)
                    Going with the winner.
                          (beat)
                    Then why are you here?  What game
                    are you playing now, Methos?

      Methos shrugs.

                                      METHOS
                          (beat)
                    It's in the center of the fountain. 
                    Blue, then green, then red.

      MacLeod hesitates.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're better than this.

                                      METHOS
                          (off his watch)
                    You've got twenty-four minutes.

      MacLeod holds his gaze for a moment, then turns and leaves.


      Cassandra paces tensely.  Then she gets the BUZZ.  She turns
      toward it, off guard, expecting MacLeod.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Duncan, what took you so long?

      But it's Kronos.

                                      KRONOS
                    I m afraid MacLeod is otherwise
                    engaged.

      Kronos steps into the room.  Right behind him are Caspian
      and Silas.

      Kronos moves toward Cassandra.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    As I remember, I owe you something.

      Kronos' face has a look of grim satisfaction.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Too bad you didn't know you had to
                    take my head to kill me.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I'll take it now!

      As Cassandra moves to pull out her SWORD, Kronos tears it
      from her grasp.

      He takes out a KNIFE just like the one she stabbed him with
      in his pavilion ages ago.

                                      KRONOS
                    I've waited a long time to give this
                    back to you.

      As Cassandra backs away from the blade.


      Kronos has a map of the world laid out on the table.  He
      looks up and sees

      METHOS

      entering the room.

                                      KRONOS
                    We missed you.

                    Your bomb didn't go off.  Not much
                    of a plan.

                                      METHOS
                    I'll think of better.

                                      KRONOS
                    I'm sure you will, or I'll just have
                    to improvise.
                          (beat; casual)
                    By the way, where were you?

                                      METHOS
                    I was just...

                                      KRONOS
                          (cuts in; matter of
                            fact)
                    Warning your friend.

      Methos doesn't allow a reaction.  Kronos sighs and gives
      Methos a patronizing look.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Did you believe I wouldn't know you'd
                    tell MacLeod?

                                      METHOS
                    It's not like you think.

                                      KRONOS
                    It's exactly like I think.

      Methos is silent.  Kronos fixes him with a cold smile.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    My dearest brother, that's what makes
                    you my perfect right arm -- we think
                    alike, we always have.

                                      METHOS
                    I doubt that.  Nobody thinks like
                    you Kronos.

      Kronos laughs.

                                      KRONOS
                    The answer of a true scholar.

      Kronos turns his attention back to his map and a small device
      that looks like a cross between a detonator and a cell phone.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    See this?  Isn't it beautiful?  All
                    I do is punch in a few numbers and a
                    small vial explodes in the reservoir
                    above Bordeaux.  And then... Well,
                    you know what happens then.
                          (beat)
                    We all make our own little plans. 
                    And I'm waiting for the rest of yours. 
                    I know you won t disappoint me.
                          (expansive)
                    I forgive you already.  Come... I
                    have something else to show you.

      Methos follows Kronos across the room and down a hallway.


      Kronos stops at a barred room --

                                      KRONOS
                    She was asking about you.

      Methos looks into the barred room to see --


      Cassandra is locked inside, lying on a mat, tied up and
        unconscious.


      Methos' expression is locked down as he stares in at
      Cassandra.

      Kronos throws an arm over his shoulders, brotherly.

                                      KRONOS
                    What are you thinking now?  How you're
                    going to get out of here to tell
                    MacLeod?

                                      METHOS
                    You mistake me.

                    Try to leave, and the minute I sense
                    you're gone, she dies.

                    Why would I care?

      But he can't keep the rage and frustration out of his eyes.

                                      KRONOS
                    You can't out-think me, Methos, and
                    you can't out-fight me.  And you
                    sure as hell can't kill me.

                                      METHOS
                          (murmurs)

                    You had your shot and you couldn't

      The massive, ancient, rusted bolt that held Kronos in his
      prison.  He tosses the bolt onto the table in front of Methos.

                                      KRONOS
                    So you had your thousand years of
                    study, while I had a thousand years
                    of crusts of bread flung to me by
                    the priests you left.

      Kronos' tone is pleasant, but the undercurrent is dangerous.

                          (off Methos' look)
                    And when he comes back, he finds
                    someone's stolen his woman.
                          (beat)
                    If it was me, I'd want you dead.

                                      METHOS
                    You're not MacLeod.

                                      KRONOS
                          (laughs)
                    He's known you a few years.  I've
                    known you a thousand times as long.

      Kronos moves closer.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    I knew you'd send MacLeod to the
                    fountain.  And you knew I knew.
                          (beat)
                    So I did what you expected.  I went
                    and got the witch while she was
                      unprotected.

                                      METHOS
                          (beat)
                    Then you do know me better than I
                    know myself.

                                      KRONOS
                    Of course I do.  Your plan was
                    perfect.  Your plans always are.

                                      METHOS
                    Then there's nothing left to do but
                    kill MacLeod before he comes after
                    me.

      Methos turns to go.  Kronos stops him.

                                      KRONOS
                    Don't worry, my friend.

                    MacLeod won't live long enough to
                    seek revenge on the friend who
                    betrayed him.

                                      METHOS
                    You sent Silas?  Or Caspian?

                                      KRONOS
                    Both.
                          (with a nasty smile)
                    You can owe me.

      Off Methos' far off stare --


      Cassandra is awake, but still tied up, as Methos enters with
      a breakfast tray.  He crouches beside her to offer it to
      her.

                                      METHOS
                    You should eat.

      She spits at him.  He shakes his head sadly.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    This is familiar.

      Cassandra's white with hatred and fear.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I'm not your sorry little slave
                    anymore.  I know what I am now. 
                    What you are.
                          (beat)
                    You may have fooled MacLeod, but
                    you've never fooled me.

                                      METHOS
                    I wasn't trying to fool anyone.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    If MacLeod knew what you really were,
                    he would have taken your head long
                    ago.

                                      METHOS
                    He had his chance.  He didn't.

      He studies her thoughtfully, not angry, not apologetic.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    It wasn't all bad.  When we were
                    together.

      She looks at him a beat, then looks away.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I only served you because you forced
                    me.

                                      METHOS
                    Don't hate yourself.
                          (shrugs)
                    It happens.  Look at Patty Hearst. 
                    It's called Stockholm Syndrome. 
                    Hostages come to rely on their captors
                    for life, for food, for approval --
                    and they fall in love.

      Cassandra fixes him with a look of contempt.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I never loved you.

                                      METHOS
                    But you thought you did.  You thought
                    I would protect you.
                          (beat)
                    You forgot what I was.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Untie me, you'll see how much I
                    remember.  I'll take your head with
                    my bare hands.  You, then Kronos.

                                      METHOS
                    Then you're stronger than I am.
                          (beat)
                    I had my chance at Kronos, and
                    couldn't strike.

      She hisses at him.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I'll strike.

                                      METHOS
                    Whatever.
                          (beat)
                    Love me or hate me, it doesn't matter
                    now.  It's Kronos who has the power.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Because you give it to him.  Like
                    always.

                                      METHOS
                    I've seen what happens to anyone who
                    goes up against him.
                          (beat)
                    If we want to survive, we'll keep
                    him happy.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I didn't then, and I won't now.  I'd
                    rather die.

                                      METHOS
                    Then you'll die.

      He grabs her arms, intense, forces her to meet his gaze.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    And you can forget about MacLeod
                    coming.
                          (beat)
                    He's dead.

      And off that --


      Kronos is furious as he stands facing Silas.

                                      KRONOS
                    He killed Caspian and you just let
                    him get away!

                                      SILAS
                      I searched the river.  I searched
                    for hours.
                          (beat)
                    I found this.

      He holds out Caspian's SWORD.  Kronos looks at it a beat,
      then takes it.

                                      KRONOS
                    I will mourn him.
                            (devastated)
                    Never again will we be four.

                                      SILAS
                    I'll go back out.

                                      KRONOS
                    No.  Come with me.

      He storms toward Cassandra's room.  Silas follows.


      Methos is standing in the room, a tray of food untouched in
      front of Cassandra.

                                      METHOS
                    It's not pleasant even for an Immortal
                    to starve to death.

      She throws him a look as Kronos storms in, followed by Silas. 
      Kronos grabs Cassandra by the arm, pulls her to her feet.

                                      KRONOS
                          (to Silas)
                    If MacLeod even gets close, kill
                    her.

      He shoves Cassandra at Silas.  She struggles, turns to face
      Kronos.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    He's alive?

                                      KRONOS
                    Not for long.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (to Methos)
                    You failed.

      Kronos grabs Methos by the arm.

                                      KRONOS
                    Come, my clever friend, you and I
                    are going to poison a city.


      MacLeod is sitting at the great table, his sword in hand.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      Kronos and Methos enter, they get the BUZZ.  They turn to
      see --

                    The Three Horsemen of the Apocalypse
                    doesn't have quite the same ring,
                    does it, Kronos?  What are you going
                    to do now?

                                      KRONOS
                    You're not going to be around to
                    find out.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We'll see about that.

      He takes his stance, ready for battle.

                                      KRONOS
                    Think of the witch, Highlander. 
                    Think of Cassandra.
                          (smiling)
                    Lay down your sword, and she'll keep
                    on living.  Fight, and win or lose,
                    she's dead.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (to Methos)
                    You set me up.

                                      KRONOS
                    He's the master.

                    What do you say, MacLeod?  Your life
                    for hers?  I promise I'll take good
                    care of her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think she'd rather be dead.

      Kronos grins.

                                      KRONOS
                    Your call.

      As Kronos and MacLeod square off, Kronos commands Methos

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Go tell Silas to finish her.  And
                    let her know it was MacLeod's
                    decision.

      As Methos turns to go, MacLeod calls after him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Methos!  Don't do this!

      Methos stops, turns.  His expression is inscrutable.

                                      METHOS
                    Like you said, I go with the winner.

      Methos heads out.

                                      KRONOS
                    Methos understands what you don't. 
                    He knows what I am.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What you were, Kronos.  Your time is
                    done.

                                      KRONOS
                    You still don't understand, do you?
                    I am the end of time.

      With an almost unearthly speed, Kronos swings at MacLeod,
      nearly cutting him in half.


      As Methos comes hurrying toward Cassandra's room, Silas pulls
      her into the hallway, his ax in his free hand.

                                      SILAS
                    MacLeod's here?

      Methos nods.  Silas turns, pushes Cassandra to her knees. 
      He raises the ax to behead her --

      METHOS' SWORD

      blocks his downswing.

      SILAS

      reacts in shock.

                    You're challenging me?
                          (disbelief)
                    For the girl's head?

      He looks into Methos' eyes, sees the challenge there -- no
      backing down.

                                      SILAS (CONT'D)
                    Take it.  She's yours, brother.

      He steps aside, gesturing to Methos to take her head.  Methos
      pivots as Silas steps aside, his eyes tracking Silas' ax.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96512    "Revelation 6:8"     47.    Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

                                      METHOS
                    I'm not your brother.

      He brings his sword down toward Cassandra, slicing the ropes
      that bind her arms, then finishes the backswing to meet Silas'
      ax as it swings for him.

                                      SILAS
                    How can you do this?  How can you
                    betray who we are?

                                      METHOS
                    You have no idea who I am.

      Silas charges at Methos and Methos defends.


      MacLeod and Kronos are still at it, through the room with
      the monkeys chattering insanely.

                                      KRONOS
                    Not bad.  But not enough.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There's more.

                                      KRONOS
                          (smiles)
                    I'm sure there is.  Knowing you've
                    just killed your woman.
                          (mocking laugh)
                    Maybe you'll be with her in the
                      afterlife.

      Kronos makes an angry attack.  MacLeod deflects the blow and
      manages to knock Kronos a little off balance.


      Methos seems to be getting the upper hand.  Then both Methos
      and Silas react to an O.S. battle yell.
