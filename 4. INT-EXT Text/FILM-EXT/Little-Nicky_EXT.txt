A beautiful late summer night.
Crickets chirping, sprinklers
sprinkling.
We PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,
where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.
He
has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.
Suddenly
the lights turn on.
PEEPER
(whispering)
Showtime!
We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's
window.
She is wearing business attire.
PEEPER (CONT'D)
Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy?
(takes bite of sandwich)
Well you'll feel better once you slip
off those work clothes and get into some
sweats.
The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing
her feet.
PEEPER (CONT'D)
Oh my G-D, yes!
I wish you would let me
rub those feet.
Of course I wouldn't
use my hands.
Heh heh heh heh...
He sips some wine.
The mother starts to unbutton her blouse.
She takes it off,
revealing a nice bra.
PEEPER (CONT'D)
Looks like Victoria just told me her
secret.
The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.
Mouthing
the words as he goes.
PEEPER (CONT'D)
Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,
first brassiere sighting...
(stops writing)
I will pleasure myself to this image for
months.
MONTHS I TELL YOU!
The mother starts to unbutton her pants.
Her young son walks
in wearing a scouts uniform.
PEEPER (CONT'D)
Young Scottie Dunleavy.
What
unfortunate timing.
You mother was just
getting comfy.
The son talks to his mother excitedly.
PEEPER (CONT'D)
Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great
knots today or whatever.
Now get out.
The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.
PEEPER (CONT'D)
Now what.
This simply won't do.
The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.
The son
answers.
SCOTTIE
Hello?
PEEPER
Hello, Scottie.
Why don't you go
downstairs like a good boy and let your
mother freshen up.
SCOTTIE
Who is this?
PEEPER
Just a little birdie.
A birdie who
wants to see if your mother's panties
match her bra.
MOTHER
Oh my G-D Scottie.
Is there a man up
our tree?
The peeper gets nervous.
PEEPER
Tell her no.
Tell her it's just a big
bird.
The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.
We SEE Scottie with his sling shot.
The mother nods yes.
He
shoots it.
It hits the peeper square in the head.
He falls
to the ground with a thud.
PEEPER (CONT'D)
Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.
And
wear your bikini.
The peeper looks up.
He sees Scottie pushing a television
out the window.
It lands on top of the peeper.
He's dead.
HARD CUT:
We see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES.
We hear screaming.
Wham!
We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in
a heap in a shallow pit of coals.
Dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the
fire wall at different levels.
(NOTE: All the arrivals
clothes are now burned & shredded).
GATEKEEPER (O.S.)
Welcome!
The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his
station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.
PEEPER
Am I in hell?
GATEKEEPER
What do you think?
A GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.
We
leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...
MATTE PAINTING HELL
MUSIC UP: "RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL" BY VAN HALEN
The VAST and insane kingdom of Hell.
A road leads toward it
like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.
We see
the black castle in the distance.
The camera zooms into the
castle, to one particular window.
Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing
with souls.
Both are pissed.
There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot
looking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.
CASSIUS
You work your ass off for ten thousand
years, hurting people, helping others
hurt people, then you get a decision
like that.
ADRIAN
And he's dead serious.
CASSIUS
It's just such a slap in the face.
Adrian turns to the Monster.
ADRIAN
Um, excuse me, we're having a private
conversation here.
CASSIUS
Yeah, get out of here!
Beat it!
Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face.
The Monster shrugs and walks off.
ADRIAN
Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa
Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in
hell than serve in heaven."
Well, I'm
getting tired of serving in Hell.
We
need a place where we can rule.
Cassius throws a rock at the Monster.
He yelps, then turns
around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back.
Cassius sees this and gets enraged.
CASSIUS
Oh you wanna be a big man?
Bring it
on!! Let's see what you got!
The Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in
an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
That's what I thought!
ADRIAN
(to Cassius)
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
CASSIUS
I am concentrating.
Where can we rule?
ADRIAN
What do you think about...Earth?
Cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.
ADRIAN (CONT'D)
We could create our own hell there.
CASSIUS
You saying we go up there and kill
everyone?
ADRIAN
Eventually, Cassius.
But first we
corrupt as many as we can so that when
we do destroy them...
CASSIUS
...their damned souls will be ours.
ADRIAN
It's our time, brother.
The two look at each other.
They start running toward the
fire wall.
Knocking souls out of their way.
GATEKEEPER
Hey, what are you doing?!?
They get closer to the fire.
GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
You can't go through there.
The fire
flows in, not out.
They dive through the fire wall.
It FREEZES.
GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
You know something?
You guys suck!
You
really suck!
Sirens go off.
Dogs start barking.
Lights flash.
And we
hear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the
firewall hard.
We see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED
SOULS in hell are sneaking off.
The DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do.
Dad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire.
DAMNED SOULS (O.S.)
What's going on?
Where are we?
We keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud
thuds.
JIMMY THE DEMON
Nothing's getting through that.
The
fire is solid as a rock.
NICKY
We gotta get this bad boy burning again.
Ideas?
DAD
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to
come back through the other way.
NICKY
So go get 'em, Dad!
DAD
I'm too weak.
The process has already
begun.
Dad holds up his hand.
His pink is hanging by a thread.
We
see the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight.
NICKY
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
JIMMY THE DEMON
I'm just a demon, Nicky.
I don't got
devil blood in me.
I'd last two minutes
up there with your brothers.
NICKY
You're not saying it's up to me?
The MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as
if to say, "oh no."
NICKY (CONT'D)
I've never been to Earth.
I've never
even slept over at some other dude's
house!
JIMMY THE DEMON
You're the spawn of Satan.
You got it
in you.
DAD
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen
on Earth is you get killed, in which
case, boom, you end up back here.
NICKY
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth
and kill my brothers?
JIMMY THE DEMON
Not go.
They left together at the exact
same time.
They gotta come back
together at the exact same time.
Dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.
DAD
Here.
Get them drunk from this.
One
sip and they'll be trapped inside.
Once
you've got both of them, you bring the
flask back through the gate.
Dad's pinky is hanging.
Jimmy pulls it off and examines it.
The Monster gags.
JIMMY THE DEMON
Your ol' man's got less than a week.
Nicky looks petrified.
NICKY
No.
This can't be happening.
DAD
Son, just do your best.
Nicky looks teary eyed.
The moment is broken by the Monster,
who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire.
Nicky goes through the solid fire wall.
PAUSE.
The Monster
taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get
a move on."
Nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in
the coal pit.
His Dad limps back to him.
JIMMY THE DEMON
You were gone ten seconds.
What
happened?
NICKY
I got hit by a big light that was
attached to a lot of metal.
DAD
That's a train, son.
Don't stand in
front of them.
NICKY
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take
a mulligan on this one.
DAD
Please, Nicky, get back up there.
(his ear falls off)
Try to hurry.
Nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall.
A BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance.
People put
money in his pot.
PREACHER
Oh how the Lord loves you.
All his
children.
(passerby puts in money)
He thanks you for your kindness.
(another woman puts in money)
God bless, Ma'am.
The Lord loves you...
The Lord loves you...
We see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind.
The PREACHER
sniffs.
PREACHER (CONT'D)
The Lord does not love you.
I
sense...pure evil.
(thrusts his cross in Nicky's
face)
You make the Lord very nervous.
(feeling hot)
I'm burning...ahhh.
(running away)
The Devil walks among us!
He runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people.
PREACHER (CONT'D)
Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast!
He gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance.
He
disappears.
Beefy turns to Nicky.
BEEFY
Makin' friends already.
NICKY
(shivering a little)
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
BEEFY
You're on Earth now, kid.
Gonna have
the same physical needs and limitations
a human has.
We'll stop by K-mart.
Get
you some warm clothes.
NICKY
I also have this odd pain in my mid
section.
Kind of a hollow feeling...
BEEFY
That pain is hunger.
K-mart bag is next to a bench.
PAN UP to see Nicky wearing
an extra warm SKI OUTFIT.
Sitting next to him on the bench
is Beefy.
Between them is a big bucket of POPEYE'S FRIED
CHICKEN.
Nicky takes out a drumstick.
NICKY
So far, so good.
Now what?
BEEFY
Put it in your mouth.
Nicky puts it in his mouth.
Holds it there.
BEEFY (CONT'D)
Move your teeth up and down.
Nicky does.
He chews for a long time.
BEEFY (CONT'D)
Now you gotta swallow it.
Tilt your
head back and let the meat slide down
your throat-hole.
Nicky does.
He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.
NICKY
Hey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
BEEFY
It sure is.
Now eat it up.
You're
gonna need your energy.
NICKY
I got energy up the ying-ying.
Let's
get cracking!
NICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right
into the path of a moving bus.
Beefy is walking with him down the street.
Nicky is crazy
cautious.
NICKY
From now on.
I'm just going to avoid
all moving metal objects.
BEEFY
Great.
Now your father gave me some
deposit money for a nice pad on the
Upper East Side.
But I misplaced it.
FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:
Nicky and Beefy.
BEEFY
So I found this other joint for you.
But you're gonna have a roommate.
We HEAR the bells toll.
We see the beautiful exterior of a
large church.
Beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk.
PAN OVER TO:
Nicky, his pants around his ankles.
He's trying to do the
same.
NICKY
This is intense!
And it happens every
day?
Sometimes twice?
I gotta tip my
hat to you people!
BEEFY
Look, it's okay for me to shit the
street.
But you gotta use a toilet.
NICKY
(pulling up pants)
Okay, just point me in the right
direction next time.
BEEFY
Come on, there's like ten million people
in this city and the clock is ticking.
NICKY
Well, let's rock and roll.
Nicky looks at the next person walking by.
It's a CHINESE
DELIVERY GUY on a bicycle.
Nicky clotheslines him, taking
him off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Get in the bottle.
Dad's falling apart.
You froze the gate and you're killing
him.
Drink!
Nicky puts the flask to the Chinese Guy's lips.
CHINESE DELIVERY GUY
I'm not thirsty!
I'm not thirsty!
NICKY
just get in the flask!
The Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick
to the head and runs away.
Nicky gets up.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Adrian and Cassius!
You think a kick to
the head is gonna make me throw in the
towel?
Well, in the immortal words of
Judas Priest, "You got another thing
comin'."
Beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the
bottle up to a few more PEDESTRIANS.
Nicky approaches various people as they pass.
(To be shot
long lense, real people, real reactions.)
nicky walks up to a homeless man.
He thrusts the bottle in
his face.
To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes
it and drinks.
Nothing happens.
Nicky is baffled.
He tries
to take the flask back, but the man won't let go.
Finally he
grabs it away from him.
The man starts throwing garbage at
Nicky as he walks away.
Nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a
Popeye's drumstick.
NICKY
All that running and chasing is making
the sleep thing want to come early.
BEEFY
I think we have to work on narrowing
down our list of suspects.
Now I'm
going to go check in with some of my
contacts uptown.
Beefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores.
He's asleep.
Beefy sighs.
BEEFY (CONT'D)
Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just
begging to come out...
Beefy walks away.
Nicky snores.
Masses of birds fly out of the trees.
Nicky
snores.
Squirrels run out of trees.
Nicky snores.
ON WORRIED PEOPLE
Staring at Nicky who continues to snore.
Two HEAVY-METAL
GUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a
goofy dance.
They hear something and turn the music down:
it's the distant sound of Nicky's snore.
PETER
Sounds like our devil dance actually
worked this time.
JOHN
'Bout time...
Nicky snores.
It sounds like "I will eat your hearts."
The
worried people run away.
Nicky snores.
Children on the
Carousel, going real fast, upset.
Nicky snores.
Peter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench.
JOHN (CONT'D)
There's our man.
PETER
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties
to the dark side.
A sleazy STREET VENDOR shuffles over towards Nicky.
He eyes
the flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket.
JOHN
What's with that guy?
PETER
Gotta be one of his disciples or
something.
Suddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten
drumstick) and runs off.
JOHN
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got
ripped off.
PETER
Should we wake him up?
JOHN
Yeah.
You do it.
Peter gets up and shakes Nicky who comes to with a loud
SNORT.
PETER
Rise and shine, devil guy.
Some dude
just stole your shit.
Nicky feels for the flask.
It's gone.
NICKY
Oh nooooo....
Fire shoots out of Nicky's mouth.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Which way did he go?
JOHN
That way.
Nicky is about to run off.
Looks at John's shirt.
NICKY
Iron Maiden live double disc is simply
phenomenal.
He runs off.
PETER
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
JOHN
The Dark Prince is here.
Nicky is searching the street for his flask.
He walks past
several STREET VENDORS who have set up their wares on the
sidewalk.
PAUSE.
Nicky comes walking back into frame as he
sees his flask (and half-eaten drumstick) laying on the
blanket of the VENDOR.
NICKY
Hey...
STREET VENDOR
See something you like, my man?
NICKY
Yes.
I would like my flask back.
The street vendor stands, very angry.
STREET VENDOR
You callin' me a thief, my man?
NICKY
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who
has my flask.
STREET VENDOR
And if that is your so-called "flask,"
how would I have it unless I was, in
fact, a thief?
NICKY
(not sure what the answer is)
I don't know?
A YUPPIE JOGGER is checking out the flask.
MAN
Yeah, how much for the silver flask
there?
STREET VENDOR
Well, that's a very special item.
The
cap itself is one hundred percent
plappium.
It's a value is over three
thousand dollars.
MAN
Really.
Where's it from?
NICKY
It was handcrafted in hell by Satan
himself and is only to be used for the
capture and containment of my blood
brothers so that the firefall of Hades
will burn brightly once again.
MAN
Really.
I think we'll let you keep it
then.
He walks away.
STREET VENDOR
Okay, now you gone and done it.
You
done messed with my business bitch!
NICKY
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise
your voice.
It's making my muscles
tighten.
We see that Nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.
STREET VENDOR
Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me?
I'll show you some crazy eyes.
Let's
get busy.
The vendor makes an even crazier face at Nicky and starts
swinging his fists around.
Nearby, VALERIE, an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is
selling clothes off a spread out blanket.
She notices what's
going on.
Nicky's eyes widen in panic.
Just then, Valerie steps in.
VALERIE
Excuse me, does that flask belong to
this man?
STREET VENDOR
(frustrated)
Now you callin' me a thief?
Damn.
VALERIE
Look, I know you come out here and sell
stolen stuff all the time.
But today,
the guy you stole from just happened to
walk by and bust you.
So why don't you
admit today's not your day and give him
his flask back?
STREET VENDOR
Or what're you gonna do about it?
Ugly
me to death?
VALERIE
No, but maybe that cop over there might
have something to say.
Valerie points to a cop across the street.
The Street Vendor
ponders this for a second, then...
STREET VENDOR
Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.
(looking at Valerie)
And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes
and find a new corner.
Before I show
you what real crazy is.
The vendor does crazy eyes again.
VALERIE
Fine.
I will.
Nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick.
NICKY
Hey, mister.
I'll be seeing you in a
few years.
Valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and Nicky
follows her.
NICKY (CONT'D)
That was amazing.
Thanks so much.
You
didn't have to do that.
VALERIE
That's okay.
I get messed with all the
time and when I saw him doing that to
you I just lost it.
I hate when people
take advantage of tourists.
It ruins it
for the rest of us.
NICKY
You think I'm a tourist?
VALERIE
I'm sorry.
I just assumed.
Your accent
maybe.
Where are you from?
NICKY
The South.
VALERIE
Really?
NICKY
Yeah.
Deep south.
(laughs hard)
She laughs along with him, not sure why.
VALERIE
Why are you laughing?
NICKY
I don't know, but I like it.
Say.
Your
glasses are nice.
They make your eyes
look sparkly and big.
It's fun to look
at them.
VALERIE
My dad's an optometrist.
NICKY
My dad's in hell, and he's falling
apart.
VALERIE
I'm sorry.
It's really tough when your
parents get older.
NICKY
If I don't save him, I don't know what
I'm gonna do.
VALERIE
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like
you will figure something out.
Nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her.
He
hands her the half-eaten drumstick.
NICKY
Here, have a Popeye's.
This drumstick
ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
VALERIE
That's alright.
I already ate lunch.
I
actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
NICKY
Could I come with you to getting a
Gelati?
VALERIE
If you want to.
NICKY
Want to?
A million angry octopus people
couldn't hold me back!
VALERIE
"Octopus people?"
NICKY
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Nicky laughs.
They exit the ice cream store, eating Gelati.
NICKY
It's freezing my hands.
VALERIE
It's not that cold.
Here, let me wrap
it.
Valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for Nicky.
Just
then the PREACHER walks by.
He quickly turns his head,
sensing Nicky.
PREACHER
Why do you taunt me with your darkness?!
Your evil is stinking up our streets!
We're all gonna die!
He takes off running right into a lamp post.
VALERIE
This town is really going to hell
lately.
(Nicky nods)
So what part of the city do you live in?
NICKY
I have an apartment.
I don't remember
exactly where.
My dog knows, though.
VALERIE
(laughs)
You have a dog?
What kind?
NICKY
I'm not sure.
I'd ask him, but he's
uptown talking to his contacts.
Beefy is screwing a female dog from behind.
BEEFY
Remember, it's not the size of the boat,
it's the motion of the ocean.
GIRL DOG
Just finish.
VALERIE
I'd love to have a dog.
But I go to
school full time.
It wouldn't be fair
to the dog.
NICKY
School?
VALERIE
Parsons School of Design.
I knew
growing up I wasn't much to look at, so
I put my energy into making things that
are pretty.
NICKY
What's that pleasant smell coming from,
your skin?
VALERIE
My perfume?
He takes her wrist to his nose.
He stares at it, licks it.
VALERIE (CONT'D)
(laughs)
It's called "Comptoir Sud Pacific."
Which I think is the French word for
coconuts.
Nicky stops and looks at her.
NICKY
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch
of butterflies flapping around in my
stomach.
Is that normal?
VALERIE
Sometimes, sure.
NICKY
Good.
I was concerned.
The Gatekeeper is near the frozen fall.
We hear loud
wailing, moaning, etc., coming from the other side.
GATEKEEPER
Doesn't sound very good behind there.
I
hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth.
The Monster is smoking a cigarette and wearing a leather
biker's hat.
He nods along in agreement.
PAN TO LUCIFER
Who's sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of
fire/pond.
LUCIFER
You know, I was the one who created
Hell.
GATEKEEPER
I know, your wickedness.
LUCIFER
I started slow, though.
For years, I
was just giving people hot foots.
Actually, you can give all the credit
for Hell to my first wife; she was the
inspiration.
She was an ugly one, too.
One day, she asked me if I wanted super
sex.
I said I'll take the soup.
The Monster laughs really hard.
LUCIFER (CONT'D)
Take it easy there, Chewbacca.
In fact,
you look like her mother, except she had
more hair.
The Monster laughs even harder.
LUCIFER (CONT'D)
You know what was in Hell when I came
down here, Cassius?
GATEKEEPER
It's Stanley, sir.
LUCIFER
Nothing.
No mountains.
No castles.
Looked like a giant parking lot.
It
wasn't even called Hell.
GATEKEEPER
What was it called, sir.
LUCIFER
Boogerland!
GATEKEEPER
That's nice, Grandpa.
Why don't you
just enjoy the fishing?
LUCIFER
I can't enjoy anything.
I go fishing.
I catch nothing.
I go to orgies, I
catch everything...
We hear the Monster laughing again as we PAN DOWN Grandpa's
fishing line to:
We SEE a MINIATURE PEEPER squirming on the fish hook.
A
giant fanged fish engulfs the Peeper's body.
Only his head
is sticking out.
PEEPER
I deserve this!
Several ELEVEN YEAR-OLDS stumble out, drunk.
KID
I just stole twenty-five bucks off the
bar.
KID #2
How many beers did you have?
KID # 3
Eight sips.
KID
I had five!
I'm so wasted.
They both high five, throw up and fall.
PAN over to ADRIAN
sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle
of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS.
ADRIAN
When an adult goes to Hell, that's
terrific.
But when a child goes...
that's why I'm in this business.
Adrian looks across the street and sees Nicky walking with
Valerie.
He's shocked.
Valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her
collection.
NICKY
So you're saying, make all pants with a
drawstring, then heavier set gals don't
have to feel humiliated by telling their
waist size in front of the whole store?
VALERIE
Basically, yeah.
NICKY
Wow.
Maybe you should make drawstring
socks for gals with fat ankles.
Valerie laughs.
VALERIE
You know what's nice about you?
You
just seem happy being yourself.
You
don't try to act cool.
NICKY
Thanks much.
You know what's nice about
you, Valerie?
VALERIE
What?
Up the street, Adrian's eyes redden.
NICKY looks like he's
been stunned by something.
NICKY
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
VALERIE
What was that?
NICKY
(shocked and confused)
I...I don't know why I just said that.
I meant to say that...
QUICK CUT TO:
Adrian's eyes flashing.
NICKY (CONT'D)
...I've always wanted to have sex with a
gross pig.
What do you say we go behind
that dumpster, pull our pants down and
see what happens?
Valerie's very hurt.
VALERIE
You're a jerk.
She turns and walks away.
Nicky looks over and sees Adrian.
His inner voice speaks to him.
NICKY (O.S.)
ADRIAN!
ADRIAN (O.S.)
You shouldn't have come here.
NICKY (O.S.)
Please, get out of my mind!
Adrian's eyes flash.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Hey, Valerie!
She stops and turns.
Nicky RAISES his fist to resist
Adrian's force.
It's too much.
His middle finger comes up,
giving her the "finger."
VALERIE
What the hell's your problem?
She runs away crying.
Nicky turns to Adrian who's still
across the street.
NICKY (O.S.)
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell.
Dad's sick.
ADRIAN (O.S.)
He's sick?
NICKY (O.S.)
Yeah, he needs souls to live.
When you
guys left, you broke the gates.
We
gotta get the gates burning again before
he dies.
Adrian processes this.
ADRIAN (O.S.)
He should have thought of that before he
denied me my birthright.
NICKY (O.S.)
Well maybe you should go back and talk
it over with him.
ADRIAN (O.S.)
How about this?
I stay here enjoying my
Schnapps and you go back.
Nicky's body jerks around.
NICKY (O.S.)
Adrian, please...
Nicky, fighting control over his body, walks slowly and
crazily into the middle of the street where he sees a large
truck bearing down on him.
JOHN and PETER get blood splattered on them.
Peter looks
down to see the "666" forms in blood on their clothes.
PETER
Check this out.
The number of the
beast.
They laugh and hi-five.
ON THE TV - DAY
Nicky walks around the corner.
SIGN READS: "Parson's School -
Student Housing"
Nicky is standing in front of the dorm rooms.
He looks up.
Scanning the windows, he picks up a scent.
NICKY
(he sniffs)
Coconuts...
Nicky goes to the fire escape and starts to climb.
His nose
leads him.
He reaches the window, sniffing heavily.
Nicky crouches outside her window and peers in.
We see Nicky hurtling toward the street.
Holding his eyes.
VALERIE
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry!
Suddenly he stops.
Suspended above ground.
Valerie doesn't
hear the expected thud.
VALERIE (CONT'D)
Nicky?
He floats up, but he can't see.
NICKY
Valerie?
VALERIE
Are you dead?
NICKY
No.
VALERIE
What are you doing?
NICKY
I think I'm floating.
VALERIE
Why would you be floating?
NICKY
I don't know.
Maybe it's because of
your sweet voice.
VALERIE
Am I supposed to not be freaked out
right now?
Because I am.
He's floating up.
He slows down.
NICKY
I can't see you but I can smell you.
And you make me feel alive in a way I've
never felt before.
CUT TO REVEAL he's floating outside the student's window.
The student's dripping candle wax on his belly.
STUDENT
You got the wrong window again, man.
NICKY
Oh.
Sorry, Andrew.
Valerie?
Nicky resumes floating up.
VALERIE
I'm over here, Nicky!
To the left.
Nicky is parallel with her.
He hovers in front of her, eyes
still watering.
She punches Nicky in the face, and he flies
back ten feet.
VALERIE (CONT'D)
Look, just because you're floating
doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you
giving me the finger.
NICKY
That wasn't me.
I was being possessed
by my brother, Adrian.
He's the one who
call you a gross pig.
VALERIE
What do you mean, "possessed?"
NICKY
Remember when I told you my Dad was in
Hell?
VALERIE
Yes...
NICKY
Well, that's because he's the Devil.
And he wants to keep his throne for
another ten-thousand years.
Which is
fine with me, but not with my brothers,
so they broke out of Hell, causing my
dad...
VALERIE
... "The Devil?"...
NICKY
...to decompose.
And I love my
Dad
very much.
So I came to Earth to save
him but then crazy eyes stole my flask
and I met you and...well, my dog tells
me I just might be in love with you.
His vision is clearing and he can start to see her.
She is
totally in shock but still here.
VALERIE
Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke.
Nicky laughs.
Valerie joins in.
VALERIE (CONT'D)
I don't know if I should believe you.
Nicky starts to drop.
NICKY
You gotta believe me.
You gotta believe
in the butterflies.
VALERIE
Okay, I do.
Get back up here.
He floats up to her holding out his hand.
Nervously, she
takes his hand and suddenly she is lifting off and they are
flying.
They fly past the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.
VALERIE
This is amazing.
They soar past some more buildings.
The preacher sense something.
He looks to the sky, then
holds the cross from around his neck as high as he can.
PREACHER
The hellbeast is above us.
He's
invading our skies!
We're all gonna
die!
We're all gonna die!
VALERIE
He's kind of ruining the mood.
NICKY
Let me take care of that.
The preacher is still angrily shouting towards the sky.
PREACHER
We're all gonna die!
A fire hydrant cap turns and comes off.
A powerful blast of
water shoots out and hits the preacher, KNOCKING him across
the street into a plate glass window.
VALERIE
Can we go fly over Central Park?
NICKY
Next time.
Tonight, I want to share the
most beautiful thing I could possibly
imagine.
They fly over it, away from NYC.
VALERIE
We're going to Jersey?
NICKY
East Rutherford.
They float high above the Meadowlands.
There is an outdoor
concert going on.
OZZFEST.
We hear the Ozz on stage in his encore.
He is singing "Mr.
Crowley."
Nicky turns to Valerie.
NICKY
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live
until he was dead.
(he looks at her)
Please tell me you like metal.
VALERIE
(sings along to song)
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your
head..."
Nicky's jaw drops as he stares at her.
NICKY
My dog was right.
I'm in love with you.
They slow dance tighter.
The music swells.
John and Peter
look up from their seats far below.
Nicky sees them while
he's holding her tight.
They give thumbs up.
DISSOLVE TO:
Feeling great.
Spring in his step, we see Nicky walking down
the street.
He stops and smells some flowers at a Korean Tommet.
The
KOREANS point and seem agitated by him.
Nicky gives them a
friendly wave.
NICKY
(in Korean)
Moo ya san jie bay!
The Koreans just glare.
Nicky's confused.
MUSIC CUE:
A dissonant, nervous score accompanies the rest of the
sequence.
A NUT VENDOR leaves his cart and starts following.
Nicky
looks back a little, unnerved.
A TAXI screeches in front of
him.
The DRIVER gets out and goes after him.
A group of school girls in uniform break loose from their
teacher and start chasing Nicky.
A gigantically fat guy sees Nicky run by.
He thinks about
going after him but decides not to and takes a big bite of a
candy bar instead.
Ten guys playing wheelchair basketball see Nicky.
They point
and start wheeling after him.
Nicky is putting some distance between him and the mob.
NICKY
What's going on here?
But when he heads downhill, the GUYS IN WHEELCHAIRS start to
catch up.
They get closer and closer until... Nicky makes a
last second right turn into an alley.
The wheelchairs can't
slow down and crash into a double decker tourist BUS at the
bottom of the street.
The TOURIST on the top level look over
the edge to see the crash.
Nicky is panicking, out of breath.
A BUM (RADIOMAN) rises up
out of his cardboard box.
The bum raises his bottle and
thunks Nicky on the head.
It doesn't break.
NICKY
Ow...what was that for?
BUM
Fifty million dollars.
The bum holds up a NEW YORK POST.
It reads "MONSTER WANTED!"
And has a picture of Nicky.
Nicky is shocked.
Nicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there
blocking the entrance.
He's trapped.
They start running
right at him.
He closes his eyes.
NICKY
Release the evil.
Nicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying
insects, all with a miniature NICKY HEAD.
The Nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows
immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked
out.
We see John and Peter enter frame.
Looking very nervous.
PETER
You sure you're down with this?
JOHN
Little nervous.
Wanna puke.
They approach the cops guarding the door.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Looking for the chief.
PETER
We know where to find Nicky.
COPS grab John & Peter and drag them inside.
Nicky is lying in a huge field of tall, very green grass.
He
sits up, and feels his face to make sure it's all there.
Nicky looks around, alarmed.
He seems to be in a mountain
vale, maybe in the foothills of the Alps.
It's gorgeous.
Off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday
cake.
Nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating
down to him.
The cake lands softly in front of him, the door ajar.
After
a moment's hesitation, Nicky goes in.
People are rioting in the streets.
Looting appliance
stores...
ANGEL (O.S.)
All these good people have totally been
led astray.
CHRISTA (O.S.)
Show him Central Park.
People are drinking and smoking and burning things.
A large
circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist
fighting.
One old lady knocks the other to the ground, then
jumps on her and starts wailing away.
The spectators
exchange money.
ANGEL (O.S.)
There's like a three day rave goin' on
down there.
No on is going to work
anymore.
Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian
on his throne start to be thrust upwards.
Demons swarm
around him.
ADRIAN
Welcome to the party.
It's so nice to
see all of you here.
NICKY (O.S.)
Hey, that's Dad's throne!
How did
Adrian get that?
Is Dad okay?
ANGEL (O.S.)
Let's see...
RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO:
Adrian steps off his throne onto a small stage flanked by SIX
HERO DEMONS.
He begins addressing the crowd.
ADRIAN
I'm very proud of you.
You've taken to
sin with minimal prompting.
The crowd cheers.
ADRIAN (CONT'D)
You're acting as if there is no Heaven
or Hell.
The crowd cheers.
We see John, Peter, Beefy, Valerie and Todd hanging on
flagpoles by their underwear.
Beefy is in a special fitted
harness that looks like underwear.
ADRIAN
Well, I have some news.
Adrian morphs into the Cardinal from earlier.
CARDINAL
There is most definitely a Hell!
And
you're all going there when you die!
Which will happen in about fifteen
minutes.
The BAD PEOPLE realize they've been tricked into being bad
and they get scared.
The Preacher, who is now more battered from his fall through
the plate glass window (ask Steve), yells out.
PREACHER
We really are gonna die!
This kicks off a frenzy of the Scared Bad People trying to
run away.
But they are stopped and herded back by DEMONS.
PETER
This don't look good.
JOHN
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get
us out of this?
TODD
They castrated him.
He can't shoot
arrows, he can't piss smoke.
BEEFY
I can't screw.
(whimpers)
I can't screw.
Valerie's crying.
ADRIAN
Soon you will see things more horrible
than you can even imagine.
Adrian scans the crowd.
He sees...
The Parsons STUDENT in the kimono dancing sexily.
Adrian is
thrown.
ADRIAN
Not that horrible, but still pretty bad.
Adrian motions to some of his guards.
They nod.
ADRIAN (CONT'D)
So while we wait, for your enjoyment, I
bring you a dear sweet man and an
international icon...Henry Winkler!
A frightened HENRY WINKLER is lead onto the stage prodded by
two DEMONS.
The scared bad people finally smile.
ADRIAN
Covered in bees!
We see Henry Winkler is suddenly covered head to in a swarm
of bees.
The crowd gasps.
Nicky dissolves into walking.
He checks his pocket to see
the ball.
He looks up to see fifteen Demons marching towards
him, ready to attack.
Nicky closes his eyes and
concentrates.
NICKY
Release...the good.
When he opens them, BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES are floating around
the head of five of the DEMONS.
They stop approaching.
THEIR EYES TURN FROM WHITE BACK TO NORMAL.
And their facial
expression changes to happiness.
They wave at the
butterflies.
ANGLE ON
MORE DEMONS keep closing.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Release the good...
Five more are stopped by something.
They look down and see
fluffy white BUNNY RABBITS at their feet.
They start petting
them.
The REMAINING DEMONS advance on Nicky.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Release the awesome.
...then stop, their path blocked by a very large bucket of
POPEYE'S FRIED CHICKEN.
The Demons consider the bucket of
chicken.
One Demon takes out a piece.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Put it in your mouth and let it slide
down your throat-hole.
The Demon bites into it.
He can't help but grin a little.
DEMON
Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
The OTHER SOULS dig into the bucket.
Only ten minutes left.
The dudes on the flagpoles are chatting nervously.
TODD
One thing I really regret is never
having experimented sexually.
PETER
You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen
Burner?
What are you talking about?
JOHN
He means getting it on with someone like
that freak.
ANGLE ON:
The student dancing for a mesmerized Demon.
BACK ON PETER, TODD and JOHN
TODD
His name is Andrew.
I know that guy.
JOHN
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Nicky leads his small army of reformed Demons (followed by
butterflies & bunnies and carrying the chicken bucket) down
the path toward the rally.
We see they have a golden
light/haze of good around them.
Adrian is underneath Valerie.
ADRIAN
You know, from this angle, you're kind
of cute.
VALERIE
You think so?
Why don't you come a
little closer and I'll show you a better
angle.
He moves a little closer, and she spits on him.
He smiles.
Opens his mouth and catches her spit.
He swallows.
ADRIAN
Yummy.
Everyone is grossed out.
TODD
Oh my G-d, he just opened his mouth and
swallowed that spit.
BEEFY
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
ADRIAN
Keep it up and I just might make you my
Queen for a night or two.
JOHN
You want a queen?
Got one right here.
John points at Todd.
They laugh.
Adrian gets closer to
Valerie.
Just then a big butterfly appears on his shoulder.
He looks down to see:
Nicky standing there with his army.
ADRIAN (O.S.)
Little Nicky.
NICKY
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the
name of all that is good: release my
friends and get in the flask.
ADRIAN
Is this a joke?
NICKY
No.
It's the inner light.
And with it
we can defeat anything you've got.
REFORMED DEMON
(eating Popeye's chicken)
It's true!
Adrian glares down at the REFORMED DEMON.
His eyes shoot out
an evil ray.
The Reformed Demon explodes into a million pieces.
His
golden insides splatter on the crowd.
The Army of Good is shaken.
Another Demon lowers his
chicken.
ANOTHER REFORMED DEMON
It's not true?
The BUCKET OF CHICKEN sprouts legs and runs away.
Nicky
steps forward bravely.
NICKY
Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no
choice.
Nicky leaves frame and he flies up towards Adrian.
Nicky lands on both feet standing before Adrian.
NICKY
Love lifts me up where I belong.
ANGLE ON
Crowd reacts.
ON HELL STAGE
Demons are ready to attack.
Adrian waves them off.
ADRIAN
Not bad, little brother.
Let's see what
you've got.
Nicky thinks, holds out his hands.
A rainbow shoots out onto
the stage between them.
PAUSE.
We see that a cute little
chipmunk is standing on it's hindlegs eating a nut.
ON CROWD
The army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see
this.
BACK ON HELL STAGE
Adrian nods, holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out.
He has made a terrible PYTHON that comes over and eats the
baffled chipmunk in one bite.
Nicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of
flowers.
Adrian raises his hand and a crazed MEXICAN GARDNER with a
lawn mower comes by and mows them down.
Nicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a MOTHER
pushing a NEW BORN BABY in a carriage.
Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who
leaps out and starts beating up on the mother.
Nicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF.
The evil Dwarf
stops beating her up and holds her hand.
ADRIAN (CONT'D)
Enough.
I'm going to kill you with my
bare hands.
Adrian punches Nicky hard in the jaw.
He goes flying off the
platform.
Nicky's body falls towards the ground.
It's about to hit,
when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall.
Nicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him.
Nicky
rolls away at the last second.
Adrian hits the bed hard and
bounces up.
Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back
down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed.
Nicky holds
out the flask.
NICKY
Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the
flas...
Adrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face,
sending him flying off the bed.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!
Nicky is an expert pillow fighter.
He lands a series of
awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves.
Adrian is dazed.
Nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air
to him.
Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it
lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face.
Adrian goes
down hard.
Nicky towers over him.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Now will you get in the flask?
ADRIAN
Absolutely not.
Adrian turns to his demons.
ADRIAN (CONT'D)
A little help over here.
A bunch of Demons advance.
ON FLAGPOLE
We see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run
over and lowers the five from the flagpoles.
ON ADRIAN
He looks up and glares at Henry.
ADRIAN (CONT'D)
Henry!
ON FLAGPOLE
Henry's eyes widen.
HENRY WINKLER
Oh no.
He is covered in bees again.
BACK ON ADRIAN
He turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by
demons.
Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't
open his mouth.
Adrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his
mouth.
ADRIAN
Goodbye, Nicky.
We hear CASSIUS banging against the walls.
CASSIUS (O.S.)
Come on in, bro.
Nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth.
Adrian jams
the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in.
Adrian smiles.
But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to
grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him.
As the flask hits the ground, we HEAR:
CASSIUS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Thank you, Nicky.
Cause now I'm gonna
bust Adrian's head wide open.
ADRIAN (O.S.)
I was going to let you out, eventually,
Cassius.
I swear.
NICKY (O.S.)
Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I
heard him keep saying.
We HEAR the sounds of a struggle.
All the Demons and all the people of NEW YORK form a large
circle around the flask.
Valerie and the gang make it down
off the stage.
We HEAR crazy sounds as the FLASK starts to jump.
The crowd
REACTS.
A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a
horrible thud.
VALERIE
Nicky!
NICKY (O.S.)
That was Cassius!
The FLASK starts rolling over and over on the road.
People
get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the
street.
They root for their side.
DEMON
Kill him, Adrian.
John and Peter start beating up the Demon.
We HEAR banging and beating and yelling from inside and then
the flask stops bouncing.
SILENCE.
Everybody outside holds
their breath.
Slowly out of the spout crawls NICKY.
HOORAY.
Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living
people CHEER.
The student, very happy, opens his kimono.
The people and demons near him are grossed out.
Valerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him.
VALERIE
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to
fight like that?
NICKY
From my dad's side of the family.
She laughs and kisses him on the mouth.
The crowd CHEERS.
But Nicky won't stop kissing her.
She starts to struggle for
air.
Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh.
The crowd stops CHEERING.
Valerie is waving her arms for
help.
Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss.
Adrian lets
her go.
And we hear ADRIAN'S familiar laugh.
ADRIAN
What?
No tongue?
Adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns
into a GIANT BAT.
He lets out a huge roar, then flies
around, laughing, scaring people.
Valerie runs over and picks up the flask.
She looks inside.
VALERIE
(whispering)
Nicky. Nicky.
No response.
VALERIE (CONT'D)
You gotta fly out...I know you can do
it.
(still no response)
Do it for the butterflies.
A long beat, then:
NICKY (O.S.)
Butterflies...
And Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands
on his feet.
Adrian lands and stares down Nicky.
The clock
is one minute from midnight.
Adrian swoops down.
Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the
BALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground.
Out of
it forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE.
OZZY
Hello, New York.
JOHN AND PETER
Ozzy.
They faint.
The Bat's eyes go wide in fear.
Ozzy grabs the bat, his
mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off.
Valerie
hands Ozzy the flask.
VALERIE
Put him in, Ozzy.
Ozzy spits the bat head into the flask.
The clock reads: 00:23 seconds left.
VALERIE
Grand Central, Nicky.
Start running.
JOHN
He'll never make it.
PETER
You gotta kill yourself.
NICKY
I'll just go to Heaven.
BEEFY
No if you do something bad right before
you die.
PAUSE.
Everyone looks around.
Nicky spots Henry Winkler.
HENRY WINKLER
Aw, man, not again.
NICKY
Sorry, Henry.
(focuses)
Release the Evil.
Henry is covered in bees once again.
ON NICKY AND VALERIE
Nicky picks up a big rock and hands it to Valerie.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Do me.
VALERIE
I love you.
NICKY
I love you.
Valerie smashes the rock on Nicky's head, killing him.
ON CLOCK TOWER
Six seconds left.
The STAGE, the DEMONS and everything that raised from Hell
now descends quickly into the ground.
The good people of New York cheer.
We see John, Peter, Todd,
Valerie, Beefy and the Student, who of course is dancing
seductively.
Angel is so proud.
ANGEL
Okay, you just saw my son save the
universe.
Right?!
Everyone cheers.
PAN UP from a moving baby stroller to reveal Nicky and
Valerie both pushing it.
We see Beefy walking with them.
Unbelievably happy.
A nice OLD LADY bends down to the stroller.
LADY
Oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby.
VALERIE
Thank yo.
LADY
Such a little angel.
BEEFY
Only a quarter, ma'am.
She tickles the baby.
It giggles and a small stream of fire
shoots out of his mouth and singes the Old Lady's eyebrows.
NICKY
Zachariah, say you're sorry.
BABY ZACHARIAH
(sounds like Nicky)
Sorry.
The Lady scurries away.
Nicky and Valerie laugh and continue
walking in absolute bliss.
They pass the Preacher who runs
towards us.
PREACHER
He has spilled his seed!
He is
multiplying!
Beware the progeny of the
unholy union!
We're all gonna die!
The Preacher runs straight into the camera.
BLACK.
THE END.
Little Nicky
