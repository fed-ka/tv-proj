Robin leans forward; he's spotted somethingon the street below.


HIS POV - DOWNSHOT


of a skuzzy small-time hustler namedSKATES sailing along the 

sidewalk on rollerblades.


ANGLE ON SIDEWALK


Skates skates towards us, past an OLDLADY, grabbing her purse off 

her arm.  The Lady reacts in dismay.


                               OLD LADY

                       (surprise, dismay)


TRACK WITH SKATES


Skates digs out, moving fast towardus, coming up level with a 

narrow alley between two buildings. Robin'sarm thrusts out, grabs 

Skates and yanks him O.S. into the alley.


                               SKATES

                       (startled cry)


ANOTHER ANGLE


Robin steps partway out of the alley,holding Skates by the 

shirtfront with one hand and the purse with the other. He hands 

the purse to the  Old Lady, who hurries up to take it.


                               OLD LADY

               Thank you ...


                               ROBIN

               Don't mention it.




Robin holds the mike to his mouth. Nearby is a subway kiosk and a 

ventilation grating.  Steam wafts fromit.


                               ROBIN

               -- so it looks like the Joker wasn't

               shucking me.


                               ALFRED (V.O.)

               But what graveyard could they be

               referring to?  You've already

               investigated the two cemeteries

               within the city limits.


                               ROBIN

               "The graveyard" must refer to

               something else.


OTHER ANGLE


Comes a SUBTERRANEAN RUMBLE as a subwaytrain passes by.  Lights 

flicker under the grating.  Robin reactsin frustration.


                               ROBIN (CONT'D)

               There goes the uptown local -- that

               means it's eleven-thirty!  Alfred,

               what am I gonna --


CLOSER ON HIM



                                                                                                  Page 28 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/Midnight.html                                                                                                3/10/03 7:25 PMUntitled

He stops suddenly.  Glances downat the subway grating.  SNAPS his 

fingers.


                               ROBIN (CONT'D)

               Got an idea, Alfred.  No time to

               explain.  Just pray I'm right.


He drops the mike and dashes into thesubway kiosk.




Batman and Robin stand on a ledge overlookingthe city.  Dawn 

begins to bleed the eastern sky.  A breeze WHIPStheir capes.


                               ROBIN

               I still can't believe I found you.


                               BATMAN

               I knew you would.

                       (beat)

               Though you did cut it a bit close ...


                               ROBIN

               So much of it was sheer luck.


                               BATMAN


               Not luck.  Skill.  I taught you well.


CLOSER ON THEM


Robin looks at Batman, taken aback.


                               ROBIN

               Is that all you can say?  Bruce -- I

               saved your life.


                               BATMAN

               That was the idea.


FAVOR ROBIN


                                                                                                  Page 35 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/Midnight.html                                                                                                3/10/03 7:25 PMUntitled


Robin raises his hands in a gestureof defeat.


                               ROBIN

               Okay.  I give up.


He turns to walk away.


                               ROBIN (CONT'D)

               Gotta get back to GSU.  Mid-term

               today.

 

FAVOR BATMAN


Watching Robin walk away.

 

                               BATMAN

               Hey, partner --


Robin turns, looks back.


CLOSER ON BATMAN


He smiles.


                               BATMAN (CONT'D)

               -- Thanks.


ON ROBIN


Surprised at first; then he grins --the grin of a son winning 

favor with a most demanding father.  Wesavor his triumph for a 

moment, and then:


                                                           FADE 

OUT.

 


                                      THE END
