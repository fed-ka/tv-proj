HONK!
A cab blares its horn at Richard as he runs across the
street.
His suit is rumpled and he checks his watch.
3.
Margaret crosses the street and talks on the phone.
MARGARET
You've been thinking about our talk because
I'm right.
Everyone does publicity.
Roth,
McCourt, Russo.
Hell, Chabon practically
whores himself.
Know what they have in
common?
A Pulitzer.
(off answer)
Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty
years, but that's how long it's been since
you've written a book this good.
Richard and Margaret walk in silence through the park.
Richard
finally speaks.
RICHARD
Your plan is psychotic.
MARGARET
Well I'd rather poke my eyes out than play
pretend girlfriend, but this is the big
time.
Sometimes you need to sack up.
RICHARD
Aren't Canadians supposed to be nice?
MARGARET
You wanna be an editor?
You need to make
21.
RICHARD
OK.
Fine.
Then if we "make this happen"?
You're promoting me to editor.
MARGARET
I'm doing what?
RICHARD
We go to Alaska and lie to my family?
I
risk going to jail?
Well, you're making me
editor for that.
I mean, did you think I'd
do this out of the kindness of my heart?
MARGARET
You work for me!
RICHARD
You know, during my employee orientation,
the HR rep didn't mention anything about me
marrying you.
MARGARET
Look, I came to this town alone and with
nothing.
I've worked my ass off for fifteen
years and this guy wants to ruin me because
he wrote the shittiest book of all time?
No
way.
RICHARD
Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that
sounds like your problem.
Not mine.
Margaret is stuck.
Richard really does have the upper hand.
MARGARET
Fine.
You take me to Alaska this weekend,
and I'll make you editor.
Deal?
Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it.
MARGARET (cont'd)
And I'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a-
bed, we're staying in a hotel.
Do they even
have hotels in Alaska?
RICHARD
No.
But they have huts.
Teepees really.
And you have to poop in a bucket.
But
otherwise, just like the Four Seasons.
But
with bears.
A commercial jet TAKES OFF and leaves New York City behind.
22.
We see the natural beauty of South Eastern Alaska.
Sitka is an
island the size of Maui.
Only an eight mile stretch of coast is
inhabited, the rest is complete wilderness.
At the center of the
island is a mountain with smaller hills around it.
The coast is
dotted with fishing boats.
Gorgeous.
Debbie stops.
Sitka Airport is very small, so they are already
outside by all the cars parked in the loading zone.
Debbie and Annie excitedly look at each other.
DEBBIE
Well you two...
GRANDMA ANNIE
...you're getting married this weekend!
MARGARET
RICHARD
What?
What?
GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
The whole kit and caboodle.
Margaret gives both these women a look that says "what are you
talking about?"
DEBBIE
When Gilber-something told us you were
getting married...
GRANDMA ANNIE
29.
DEBBIE
...God rest their souls...
GRANDMA ANNIE
...or friends...
DEBBIE
...we decided to give you a wedding.
GRANDMA ANNIE
Engagement party tonight...
DEBBIE
...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight.
Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks.
MARGARET
Are you witches?
GRANDMA ANNIE
Just quaint.
During the solstice it's good
luck.
It's an Alaskan thing.
DEBBIE
We've planned everything.
Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher.
GRANDMA ANNIE
I'm old, Margaret.
I don't have much time
left.
Richard lives so far away, and I
never see him.
Now I find out he's getting
married, and I have a chance to see my one
grandchild's wedding day.
It's a dream come
true for me.
A dream come true.
Please let
me see Richard get married before I die.
Please.
Long beat.
Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.
Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.
Finally,
she goes to speak, but can only get out... two big thumbs up.
The crowd cheers.
A procession of cars makes its way through town.
The cars park in a lot in the middle of nowhere, near a small
dock.
Everyone gets out of the cars and starts walking to the
ocean.
Margaret is confused.
MARGARET
I'm not getting out of this car until you
tell me where we're going.
RICHARD
Come on, it'll be OK.
I promise.
Richard points to a small island about a mile away.
Everyone rides on a 75 foot yacht.
Lots of polished wood and
chrome.
Someone passes out beers on board, and the mood is
festive.
Margaret takes a look around at the surreal scene.
MARGARET
Who are you people?
Richard lets Margaret wonder.
The ship docks and we get our first glimpse of the Paxton Estate.
It sits above the rest of the wooded island and is as tasteful as
a 15 bedroom Alaskan mansion can be.
Richard's father, GEOFFREY (60) waits on the dock. He is a bear
31.
GEOFFREY
So you must be Margaret.
We've heard a lot
about you.
All of it bad.
Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical
sling backs.
GEOFFREY (cont'd)
I mean, I almost shit myself when I heard he
was marrying the devil woman.
MARGARET
I thought it was the dragon lady?
GEOFFREY
Either way.
RICHARD
Hey dad.
Richard shakes his father's hand.
It's a little stiff.
GEOFFREY
Welcome home.
Good to see ya.
RICHARD
You too.
GEOFFREY
Been a while.
RICHARD
Yeah.
You'd think you could make it to the
airport to mark the occasion.
Grandma Annie interrupts.
GRANDMA ANNIE
Help him with the bags Geoffrey.
(to Richard and Margaret)
Let's get you two settled.
As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots
Geoffrey a look that says "be nice".
Margaret goes far from the house so no one can hear.
Balzac
follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him.
MARGARET
Don't be a cliche, Frank.
Don't be the
wishy washy writer who changes his mind
every two seconds.
Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.
The dog starts YAPPING
to get attention.
She walks away, but Balzac continues barking.
Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the
phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear.
MARGARET (cont'd)
(to Balzac)
Sit and be quiet!
Balzac sits and pouts.
Margaret walks away and puts the phone
back to her ear.
42.
MARGARET (cont'd)
I fired Bob because he didn't have your best
interest in mind.
Our job is to help you
succeed.
He wasn't doing that.
Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she
notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.
Not
sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him
peacefully sit in the grass.
She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.
Margaret
shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when --
WHOOSH!
The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and
takes off.
Margaret jumps.
There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle.
She stays calm on the phone.
MARGARET (cont'd)
Could you hold on just a second?
With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the
eagle suspended 20 feet above her.
The eagle drops Balzac and
Margaret catches him.
Balzac looks frightened.
Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone
and picks it up.
MARGARET (cont'd)
(NONCHALANT)
Sorry, dropped my phone.
Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in
circles above her.
She decides to wrap up the call quick and get
back to the house.
MARGARET (cont'd)
Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything.
But know this.
This book is your legacy...
Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac
again.
She runs.
MARGARET (cont'd)
... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to
introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me-
tomorrow-with-your-decision.
My-phone is-
always-on.
Talk-to-you-soon.
The eagle bears down on them with talons out.
Just as the eagle
is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone
to fend back the eagle.
To her surprise, the eagle grabs
Margaret's phone and flies off.
Margaret freaks.
MARGARET (cont'd)
43.
Panicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the
eagle as an offering.
MARGARET (cont'd)
Take the dog!
Take the dog!
The eagle is long gone, but Margaret is still running with the
dog trying to bait it back.
MARGARET
This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle.
C'mon,
bring back the phone.
Richard calls out from the house.
RICHARD
What are you doing?
MARGARET
The eagle took my phone!
RICHARD
Are you drunk?
MARGARET
Your dad was right!
The eagle tried to take
the dog, so I saved it, then it came back
and took my phone.
44.
RICHARD
Did the dingo eat your baby, too?
MARGARET
Frank's going to call me on that phone.
I
need it!
RICHARD
Relax.
I've got your information backed up
on the laptop.
I'll just get you a new
phone and switch the number.
No problem.
MARGARET
Oh.
RICHARD
Now come on.
You're going somewhere with my
mom and the girls.
MARGARET
I'm not going anywhere.
RICHARD
You want a new phone?
You're going.
The Pioneer bar is a classic Alaskan bar, decorated with pictures
of every fishing vessel that has made Sitka its home.
But tonight estrogen rules, as all the patrons are women CHEERING
for an oiled, toned, and BEARDED MAN in a tiny thong who gyrates
to the beat of Prince's "Sexy Motherfucker."
On stage with the
dancer, Margaret tries to not look miserable in her NOVELTY
BACHELORETTE PARTY WEDDING VEIL WITH DEVIL HORNS.
DEBBIE
Work it Hank!
GERTRUDE
Is that a salmon down your pants?
The room laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from
Margaret's face.
Margaret remains straight faced.
MARGARET
Definitely not a salmon.
The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his
wiggling ass and gives her a feel.
She can't help but give and
embarrassed smile.
Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the
splits.
Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation.
Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek.
She
begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand.
45.
HANK
Ah, ah, ah.
I was just the warm up.
Hank sits Margaret down, and blindfolds her with a scarf.
MARGARET
What's going on?
GRANDMA ANNIE
Just sit there dear.
MC
Don't be shy ladies, tip well and often,
show Hank how much you appreciate his
assets!
And now... Ramone!
The room goes silent as a middle aged RAMONE comes on to the
stage.
He has a pot belly, threadbare thong and a thin mustache.
Ramone's dance has a Latin theme to it, and he's very good at it.
Margaret is oblivious.
MARGARET
What's that smell?
Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about
an inch away from her face.
MARGARET (cont'd)
(belly laugh)
Ahhh!!!
Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone.
After the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger
at her naughty behavior.
RAMONE
You are a naughty devil.
Ramone goes to work another part of the stage, and when he turns,
Margaret jumps off the stage and joins the ladies.
MARGARET
Good lord.
GRANDMA ANNIE
Ramone was the only male dancer on the
island for years. No one has the heart to
tell him to hang it up.
MARGARET
Want me to do it?
GRANDMA ANNIE
Thank you dear, but let's keep it our
secret.
46.
Snow capped mountains watch 20 MEN in short sleeves hit golf
balls into the ocean.
Green pontoon rafts bob in the water, made
up to look like golf greens.
Golf balls are stacked in pyramid
formations at every hitting area.
Richard comes down from the house to join the group.
Geoffrey
jokes with MR. MAGUIRE (60's, good natured) as they hit balls.
GEOFFREY
...yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that
dissolve in the water.
MAGUIRE
How does she come up with this shit?
GEOFFREY
She just does.
I stopped trying to figure
out how.
Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way.
Mr.
Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is.
MAGUIRE
(JOKING)
I'm mad at you, son!
RICHARD
Why's that, Mr. Maguire?
MAGUIRE
You fly up here and don't call me?
RICHARD
Sorry bout that.
MAGUIRE
What good is me owning an airline if I can't
give you free tickets?
RICHARD
You're right.
Don't know what I was
thinking...
MAGUIRE
Damn, straight.
Don't let it happen again!
(hands Richard a golf club)
Here, you take over.
This game is for
pussies, I'm getting a drink.
Mr. Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with
one another for the first time.
Things are awkward between
father and son, and Richard begins hitting balls to avoid
conversation.
Geoffrey finally makes small talk.
47.
GEOFFREY
Maguire's stepping down in January.
He's,
uh, handing things over to Matty.
Richard gives his dad a look.
He knows where this is going.
RICHARD
That's great for them.
GEOFFREY
So.
How's work with you?
RICHARD
Good.
Busy.
You know.
GEOFFREY
I do.
I do.
Hey, did I tell you that we're
opening a little office in Japan?
RICHARD
Congratulations.
GEOFFREY
We're not just a mom and pop operation
anymore.
We're going global.
RICHARD
Uh-huh.
Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second.
He's been
thinking about this moment for a long time.
GEOFFREY
I could really use your help.
RICHARD
Dad.
Please.
I'm in New York.
Margaret's
in New York.
We have jobs.
GEOFFREY
I know.
I know.
It's just...
RICHARD
(CHALLENGING)
It's just what?
GEOFFREY
You're only a secretary.
This pisses Richard off immediately.
RICHARD
Again with the secretary thing!
I've told
you, I'm an assistant!
48.
GEOFFREY
Just because you call yourself an
"assistant" doesn't mean you're not really
just a secretary.
RICHARD
Well if I'm "just a secretary", why would
you want me up here anyway?
Sounds like
you're doing great without me.
GEOFFREY
It's not like that and you know it.
RICHARD
Then how is it?
Explain it to me.
Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening.
GEOFFREY
Last week, a man stuck his finger up my
butt...
RICHARD
This man was a doctor?
GEOFFREY
...and it got me thinking about you.
RICHARD
I'm not sure this is coming out right.
GEOFFREY
Just shut up for a second, okay?
I want you
to have what I built.
But I'm running out
of time to show you things.
RICHARD
Stop being so dramatic.
GEOFFREY
I'm not being...
(takes a hard line)
I need you to stop dicking around down there
and get serious.
RICHARD
So this is all about what you want?
GEOFFREY
That's not what I said.
RICHARD
And me in New York with Margaret?
That
isn't serious?
49.
GEOFFREY
One day the woman is the Antichrist, and the
next day she's the love of your life?
How
is that serious?
RICHARD
Things change, dad.
GEOFFREY
(INDIGNANT)
Things change?
RICHARD
Things change.
GEOFFREY
Things change?
RICHARD
Yes.
Things change.
GEOFFREY
Things change.
That's your explanation?
Know what I think?
I think you banged your
boss and fell in love, that's what I think.
Some sorta mommy complex.
RICHARD
Nice, dad.
We gotta have these Cosby
moments more often.
This is great.
Richard drops his club and walks back to the house.
Margaret steps outside to have a moment to herself.
She's on a
patio overlooking the ocean.
It is late, but the sun is hanging
just over the horizon.
GERTRUDE
They can be a little overwhelming, but
they're great people.
MARGARET
What?
I'm just working on my tan.
(off Gertrude's look)
It's been a long day.
Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging.
GERTRUDE
Around the solstice they don't watch the
clock.
Pretty much party til they fall
over.
MARGARET
50.
GERTRUDE
I actually missed it when I was in the
states.
MARGARET
Chicago, right?
GERTRUDE
Yeah.
Since college.
MARGARET
And now you're back?
GERTRUDE
Six months now.
Call me crazy, but I love
it.
Think I'm back for good.
MARGARET
Really?
I don't know.
Don't you miss...
GERTRUDE
Neimans?
Starbucks?
Escalators?
Margaret laughs.
She likes this woman.
GERTRUDE (cont'd)
Yeah.
I miss it.
Believe me, growing up I
never thought I'd end up divorced and back
here teaching at my old elementary school.
That was always Richard's plan.
MARGARET
For you to get divorced?
GERTRUDE
(smiles, remembering)
No.
I was going to teach, he was going to
run his dad's business.
He was like a
little old man.
Had it all worked out.
MARGARET
Are we talking about the same guy?
GERTRUDE
What do you mean?
MARGARET
Well, Richard's such a player.
Gertrude looks confused.
MARGARET (cont'd)
I mean he was a total player.
Before we
started dating.
Six months ago.
GERTRUDE
51.
MARGARET
That surprises you?
GERTRUDE
Did he ever tell you why we broke up?
MARGARET
We don't really talk much about stuff like
that.
GERTRUDE
Oh.
Well I should shut up...
MARGARET
No, no.
Please.
I mean, we are getting
married.
I want to know these things.
Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed.
GERTRUDE
He proposed to me.
When we were seniors.
Margaret laughs.
MARGARET
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...
He proposed
to you in high school?
GERTRUDE
He bought this sweet little ring, and got
down on his knee.
It was so cute.
MARGARET
You must have...
GERTRUDE
... freaked out?
Oh you bet.
I broke up
with him on the spot.
MARGARET
I would hope so.
GERTRUDE
After getting rejected the first time, I
can't imagine how hard it was for him to get
up the courage to ask you.
Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is
being so honest with her.
GERTRUDE (cont'd)
Anyway.
The idea that my little old man
could be a player...
It's just not the
Richard I knew.
Good thing you're making an
honest man of him again.
52.
Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in
one swig.
She has a hard time finishing it off.
GERTRUDE (cont'd)
Well I'm empty.
I'm going to go get
another.
I think I hear Ramone wrapping up,
let's get back to the girls.
MARGARET
I'll be right in.
Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean.
Gertrude goes inside.
Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers.
MARGARET (cont'd)
We are awful people.
THWACK!
An axe slams down and splits a log in two.
Hands
quickly place another log down and THWACK!
We pull back to find
Richard playing the role of executioner.
He's still mad after
talking to his dad, and is taking it out on the firewood.
Rage
Against the Machine plays on his iPod and he's in his own world.
Behind him, the girls return to the island on the family yacht.
Their mood is light, and they chat amongst themselves.
Debbie's
mood deflates when she sees Richard.
DEBBIE
(SHOUTING)
Richard!
Honey!
Is everything OK?
With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear
or see the girls.
Annie shakes her head.
Something is up.
Richard continues to listen to his iPod, and has worked up quite
a sweat.
He's stacks the last log, takes off his soaked through
shirt, and gets a whiff of himself.
Ew.
He stinks.
Richard and Margaret board the yacht.
They wear athletic clothes
and running shoes.
Richard drives the yacht and Margaret sits by herself.
62.
Richard docks the boat at the Paxton Seafood pier.
Located in
the town's harbor, the packing plant consists of three large
warehouses, and buzzes with activity.
Fishing boats line the
pier, unload their fish, and forklifts take the fish to be
processed.
Everything is clean and organized.
Richard and Margaret walk down the pier.
He points to the SEALS
that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps.
Damn, they're cute.
Richard waves hello to WORKERS.
An elderly Phillipino man, BEK
BEK, yells at them as he walks into a warehouse.
BEK BEK
Hey, Richard!
That the lucky lady?
RICHARD
Yes sir, it is!
BEK BEK
(to Margaret)
You look much younger than everyone says.
MARGARET
That's great to hear.
RICHARD
See ya on the line, Bek Bek.
Margaret opens the door with a sour look on her face.
She's
wearing large green hip waders with suspenders, rubber fishing
boots, and gloves.
MARGARET
Is this really necessary?
RICHARD
You'll thank me later.
Richard walks towards the warehouse.
Margaret follows in her
63.
Richard keeps pushing the cart, Margaret catches up.
MARGARET
Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff?
RICHARD
It's our stuff.
69.
Richard points to the "Paxton General Store" sign.
MARGARET
That must have been handy in High School.
RICHARD
You have no idea.
MARGARET
Should you leave the cart?
RICHARD
It's our cart.
I didn't know you were such
a prude.
MARGARET
I've come to realize that being my assistant
gave you more access to my life than I ever
imagined, but there are a few things you
don't know about me.
RICHARD
I doubt it.
When I started, you were still
wearing those Ugg boot things.
MARGARET
(deadly serious)
I told you never to talk about that.
RICHARD
I'm just saying it's been a long time.
I
know it all.
Margaret turns on her new phone.
It searches for a signal.
MARGARET
(up to the challenge)
Did you know I took disco lessons in the
sixth grade?
RICHARD
Where?
MARGARET
The Y.
RICHARD
Margaret 1, Richard 0.
MARGARET
Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang.
RICHARD
At Woodstock?
70.
MARGARET
I won tickets on the radio and saw them at
the fair.
RICHARD
What'd they sing again?
MARGARET
You know.
(SINGING)
Cherish the love we have, we should cherish
the life we live...
Richard shakes his head.
MARGARET (cont'd)
Well they were good.
RICHARD
You had a lot of soul there, Canada.
MARGARET
I really like "The O.C.".
Not fake, ha, ha
isn't it funny I like this trash.
I really
like it.
RICHARD
Wow.
I'm getting shut out here.
MARGARET
Allergic to pine nuts.
RICHARD
Knew that.
MARGARET
Afraid of penguins.
RICHARD
Huh.
MARGARET
Haven't slept with a man in a year and a
half.
RICHARD
Holy shit!
You are a lesbian!
A MOTHER walking by with her 7 year old gives Richard a nasty
look.
RICHARD (cont'd)
(to mother)
My bad.
The mother walks on.
Margaret is mortified and walks faster.
71.
MARGARET
Kool and the Gang gets nothing, but that
gets a Holy shit?
I've been busy!
RICHARD
That's a really long time.
MARGARET
That hurts coming from Mr. Magic Pants.
RICHARD
I knew it had been slow going, but I figured
there was a booty call in there somewhere.
MARGARET
Yeah, well, I'm not good at that.
RICHARD
I find that hard to believe.
MARGARET
No, not that.
I'm great at that.
Aces.
Top notch.
RICHARD
I'll have to take your word for it.
MARGARET
Yes.
You will.
RICHARD
How, exactly, do you define top notch?
Margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone.
In
an instant, she's all business.
MARGARET
I need a computer and the internet.
Now.
Richard and Margaret unload champagne.
Richard is still thinking
about Gertrude and wanting to be alone.
MARGARET
So, what did you and Gertrude talk about?
Richard lies.
RICHARD
Nothing.
About her school.
The kids and
stuff.
Apparently my second grade teacher
was a pot head.
MARGARET
That was it?
I was gone for awhile...
RICHARD
(cuts her off)
Yeah.
That was it.
You know, I can do
this.
You should really go try on the dress
for my mom.
MARGARET
I was going to go for a run first, it's been
three days since I got out, I'm feeling
crazy.
RICHARD
(could care less)
Whatever.
Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but
doesn't push it.
79.
Margaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods.
She's running
hard, muttering to herself, and working out the aggression she's
accumulated over the last thirty six hours.
She's lost in her
own world, until she sees smoke, and slows to a stop.
MARGARET
What now?
Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT.
She
soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN
dancing around it.
He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a
carved bear's head mask and tribal make up.
His belly shakes as
he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song
that sounds centuries old.
SHAMAN
Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik
pifiksailiriju m 1k tuakjuk qangani
takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm.
Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance.
He begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs.
Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath.
He yells out again.
SHAMAN (cont'd)
Margaret, welcome!
She looks around.
Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity.
SHAMAN (cont'd)
Come to me, Margaret of New York.
Nope, that's her.
She carefully steps out into the clearing.
SHAMAN (cont'd)
It is I, father Paxton.
Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up.
MARGARET
What, ah, are you doing?
GEOFFREY
My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and
clear my head.
As you know, things have
been a little crazy around here.
You should
join me.
MARGARET
Ya know, I've got to get back.
GEOFFREY
You closed minded southerners amuse me.
Never willing to leave the nest and try
80.
MARGARET
I'm a big fan of the nest.
Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher.
GEOFFREY
Dance with me!
You besmirch my ways if you
deny my circle.
Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents.
MARGARET
OK, OK.
I "accept your circle."
Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire.
GEOFFREY
Clear your mind and follow me.
Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body.
Margaret
follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it.
After
a few moments, Margaret stops.
MARGARET
I'm gonna head back.
GEOFFREY
We're not done.
MARGARET
I think I am.
Margaret begins to leave.
Geoffrey calls after her.
GEOFFREY
Margaret?
Margaret stops and turns around.
GEOFFREY (cont'd)
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.
But
I'm making an effort here.
Don't leave now.
Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays.
Geoffrey is pleased.
GEOFFREY (cont'd)
Thank you.
(switching gears)
Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik
pifiksailiriju m 1k...
Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and
speeds up the dance.
Margaret is getting better, but it is still
painfully awkward.
81.
GEOFFREY (cont'd)
...tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut
qangalan uarm.
Geoffrey speeds up the dance.
GEOFFREY (cont'd)
Now you.
MARGARET
Me what?
GEOFFREY
Chant.
MARGARET
Chant what?
GEOFFREY
Whatever comes out, just chant.
It is the
way.
You'll feel better.
MARGARET
I can't...
GEOFFREY
Close your eyes.
Chant.
Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing.
Margaret closes her eyes,
but can't figure out what to say.
GEOFFREY (cont'd)
Chant!
MARGARET
I don't know any chants!
GEOFFREY
Chant!
MARGARET
(GUTTERAL)
Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...
Looking at Margaret, it's surprising she can make such a low
noise.
MARGARET (cont'd)
...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...
GEOFFREY
Chant!
The drum beat continues.
MARGARET
82.
They continue to dance, Margaret is getting into it.
MARGARET (cont'd)
...to the wall...
More sand.
More fire.
MARGARET (cont'd)
...to sweat drop down my balls...
Geoffrey stops dancing.
What did she say?
MARGARET (cont'd)
...to all these bitches crawl...
Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken
out into a Lil John song.
She continues to dance.
MARGARET (cont'd)
...To all skee skee motherfucker...
Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off.
MARGARET (cont'd)
...all skee skee got damn...
From the trees, the moment is broken when Debbie shouts out.
DEBBIE
Geoffrey!
Margaret stops chanting Lil John.
GEOFFREY
Oh Debbie, I didn't do anything.
Margaret sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing.
GRANDMA ANNIE
Is she singing about balls?
MARGARET
He told me I had to chant!
GRANDMA ANNIE
Oh, you poor dear.
Geoffrey, you can't do
this!
(to Margaret)
He's an eighth Tlingit, dear.
DEBBIE
He does this to keep in touch with "his
people".
83.
GEOFFREY
Don't make fun of my heritage!
And it was
helping.
Don't you feel better?
I feel
better.
DEBBIE
Come on sweetie, we need to get you cleaned
up.
You've got a dress to try on.
And
Geoffrey, put that fire out and come in and
help us with this wedding.
Geoffrey turns off the boom box that was hidden in the trees and
the drum beat stops.
GEOFFREY
Fine.
With a fire extinguisher, the bonfire comes to an end.
Richard helps WORKERS build a stage for the band.
He's still in
a foul mood when Margaret interrupts in a panic.
MARGARET
We need to talk.
RICHARD
I'm a little busy.
MARGARET
Well I'm freaking out.
I need to get away
from here.
From everyone.
Now.
RICHARD
Go for another run.
MARGARET
No!
I did that.
It did not help.
RICHARD
I'm a little tired of you making demands and
me just jumping...
MARGARET
(re: wedding stuff)
We're not going to need any of this if I
don't get out of here.
RICHARD
OK, high maintenance.
Let's go.
Unlike the bulky yacht, this boat is built for speed and
maneuverability. Richard starts her up.
MARGARET
Move over, I'm driving.
Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel.
RICHARD
You don't know where we're going.
Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off.
MARGARET
It doesn't matter.
ON THE OPEN OCEAN
Margaret and Richard leave everyone behind and take off for the
horizon.
87.
As they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees,
blue water and wildlife (bears, puffins, moose) that inhabit the
coastline have a calming effect on both of them.
In Alaska, it
doesn't take long to leave humanity behind.
Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep
mountain walls on either side.
Although it is still warm out, an
icy beach can be seen straight ahead.
MARGARET (cont'd)
Where are we?
RICHARD
The north pole.
Congratulations, we made
it.
(off Margaret's look)
It's a glacier.
Tracy's Arm.
You better
let me take it from here.
MARGARET
I'm fine.
RICHARD
Oh.
OK.
So like me, you've navigated a lot
of glacier fields?
And not died?
Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer.
RICHARD (cont'd)
Lady, you've got issues.
MARGARET
Yeah.
I'm a control freak.
Fine.
RICHARD
It doesn't stop there.
MARGARET
This coming from the sociopath.
RICHARD
Oh, please.
MARGARET
I'd never bring me here.
RICHARD
You drove!
MARGARET
I mean to Alaska.
RICHARD
Are you kidding me?
Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine.
88.
MARGARET
You're sick.
Doing this to them.
RICHARD
I explained to you...
MARGARET
They love you.
Do you get that?
RICHARD
Of course.
MARGARET
And you're still willing to lie to them?
RICHARD
Like you didn't know.
MARGARET
Didn't know what?
RICHARD
That we were going to lie to them.
MARGARET
I didn't know!
RICHARD
Well that makes you either stupid, or
ignorant.
MARGARET
You think I'm stupid?
RICHARD
No, but what's behind door number two...
MARGARET
(SCREAMS)
I forgot!
OK?
I forgot!
RICHARD
Forgot what?
MARGARET
What it was like!
RICHARD
What what was like?
MARGARET
To have a family!
I forgot what it was like
to have a family.
I've been on my own since
I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was
like to have people that love you, and make
you breakfast, and give you necklaces...
89.
Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of
breath.
She goes to the side of the speed boat.
MARGARET (cont'd)
I'm going to take a walk.
RICHARD
We need to head back...
MARGARET
Alone.
I need alone time.
RICHARD
What?
Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look.
MARGARET
I'm, uh, about to lose my shit.
Big time.
I need a second.
RICHARD
But...
MARGARET
(PANICKED)
Stop right there!
Richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put.
MARGARET (cont'd)
I'm going to be over there.
Away from you.
Just sit down, turn around, and act like
you're not here.
Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down
and turn around.
He does.
Margaret gets off the boat and walks
away from him on the glacier.
ON THE GLACIER
Margaret tries diaphragmatic breathing to calm down.
MARGARET (cont'd)
(manic, to herself)
You can do this.
Couple more hours, and
then you'll never see these people again.
Eventually you'll write a letter.
Apologize.
Send the necklace back.
RICHARD
(from the boat)
Margaret!
MARGARET
No talking!
90.
RICHARD
(from the boat)
Watch your step, OK?
It can be dangerous.
MARGARET
Again, you're not supposed to be...
Margaret doesn't finish her sentence.
ON THE BOAT
Richard sits with his back turned to Margaret, waiting for her
reply.
He doesn't hear anything.
That's weird.
RICHARD
(back still turned)
Margaret?
Richard turns around and looks for Margaret.
He doesn't see her.
He gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier, walking in the
direction he last saw Margaret.
RICHARD (cont'd)
Margaret?
I know I'm breaking "the rules"
here, but where are you?
He takes one more step before he hears...
MARGARET (O.S.)
(YELLING)
Richard!!!!!!!!
Help!!!!!!!!
Richard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her
voice.
He soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that --
Margaret's been swallowed by the ice.
Her upper torso sticks out
of the glacier, held up by her arms.
Her eyes are wide, and
she's almost hyperventilating.
It's a bizarre sight.
MARGARET (cont'd)
Oh, thank God!
Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.
Margaret is really scared.
MARGARET (cont'd)
Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing?
RICHARD
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Just relax.
I'll
get you out of there.
You've broken through
an ice bridge.
It happens all the time.
No
biggie.
MARGARET
Don't do that.
91.
RICHARD
Don't do what?
MARGARET
The thing that doctors do in E.R. when they
tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to
death that they're going to be OK.
Don't do
that!
RICHARD
It's not like that.
Really.
We do need to
be careful here though, I don't want us both
to fall in.
Stay still, OK?
MARGARET
Uh-huh.
Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now.
He's checking the
ice to see if it is stable.
He slowly walks her way.
RICHARD
So, I'm going to walk up to you and very
slowly pull you out.
OK?
MARGARET
I'm really cold.
RICHARD
Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded
by ice.
MARGARET
(makes sense)
OK.
Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to
his knee.
He calmly looks down on her.
RICHARD
So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits.
I'm probably going to touch boob.
But don't
freak out.
Margaret shakes her head yes.
Richard reaches down and slowly
lifts her out of the ice.
Margaret doesn't say a word.
RICHARD (cont'd)
When I get you all the way out, I need you
to hold onto me.
I'm going to carry you
over there.
Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard.
He's
strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her "over
the threshold" style, away from the hole in the ice.
He speaks
once they're safe.
92.
RICHARD (cont'd)
I've, uh, never done that before.
MARGARET
You said it was "no biggie".
RICHARD
Yeah.
Well.
You OK?
MARGARET
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Richard smiles.
Margaret smiles back.
Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.
She fits
just right.
Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully.
MARGARET (cont'd)
(SMILING)
You shouldn't of laughed at me.
RICHARD
You woulda laughed at me.
MARGARET
Yeah.
While I was getting my camera.
The two stare at each other for a beat.
There's a real spark.
They might kiss.
RICHARD
Gertrude wants me back.
Whoah.
Not what she was expecting.
She looks down.
MARGARET
And?
RICHARD
Well.
It seemed like you were having...
second thoughts.
MARGARET
Yeah.
I was.
RICHARD
Maybe we should do it.
Come clean.
MARGARET
Put me down.
Richard puts Margaret down near the boat.
She tries to regain
her composure.
MARGARET (cont'd)
You wanna call it off?
93.
RICHARD
If you do.
MARGARET
Fine.
It's over.
We'll tell them when we
get back.
ON THE BOAT
Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her.
Richard drives the boat.
They don't talk.
Richard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above
them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting
married.
The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a
hurry.
He's clearly been waiting.
GEOFFREY
Come with me.
RICHARD
Where's mom, dad?
We all need to talk.
GEOFFREY
Not now.
C'mon.
Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do.
Geoffrey storms off and they follow.
Richard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the
guesthouse.
Geoffrey stops before they go in.
GEOFFREY
(to Richard)
I haven't told your mother about any of
this, and I don't plan to.
(to Margaret)
I was really beginning to like you.
Sorry
about this.
Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside.
INSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE
The guesthouse has been converted into a squash court.
In the
middle of the court, a man patiently sits on a metal folding
chair.
It's Gilbertson.
He smiles.
MR. GILBERTSON
Hey there kids.
Good to see ya!
94.
RICHARD
(to Dad)
What did you do?
Geoffrey doesn't answer.
He's not proud of himself.
RICHARD (cont'd)
(getting angry)
What did you do, dad?!
GEOFFREY
I called him yesterday.
He told me that you
were lying, and that he was going to catch
you.
That he was going to send you to
prison.
MR. GILBERTSON
(to Richard)
We made a deal and dad here flew me up.
Now
you tell the truth, and get off scott free.
It's like it never happened for you.
RICHARD
You made a deal with him?
On my behalf?
GEOFFREY
You were making a mistake...
RICHARD
That's none of your business.
MARGARET
It's fine.
RICHARD
The hell it is.
It is not fine!
MR. GILBERTSON
Oh quack, quack, quack.
Just tell me what
really happened, and I'll be on my way.
No
one gets hurt, we all get what we want.
Margaret takes Richard's hand.
MARGARET
It's OK.
Tell him.
RICHARD
(to Geoffrey)
You do not get to make this decision.
This
is my decision.
(to Gilbertson)
The truth is... I've been working for
Margaret for three years.
Six months ago we
started dating.
I recently asked her to
marry me, and she said yes.
See you both at
95.
GEOFFREY
What are you doing, Richard?
RICHARD
(grabs Margaret's hand)
Come on, we gotta get ready.
Margaret and Richard storm out of the squash court.
The couple walks briskly to the house.
RICHARD
What was I thinking?
They act like they're
nice, but really, they're evil.
MARGARET
He's only doing it because he loves you.
RICHARD
Are you defending him?
Are you defending
the king dick?
MARGARET
Just stop.
Think about this.
RICHARD
Oh, I've thought about it.
And know what I
think?
I think you saved my life.
Thank
you, Margaret.
Getting married to you is
the best thing that's ever happened to me.
Without this, I might've ended up back here.
Up at the house, Debbie opens the door.
DEBBIE
There you are!
You two almost gave me a
heart attack.
C'mon, get dressed!
RICHARD
Coming mom!
(to Margaret)
Time to sack up.
Richard winks and goes inside.
Margaret follows, not sure.
THE WEDDING MONTAGE
-- Chairs are set up outside.
-- Guests arrive via boat.
-- Richard stands on the deck, wearing his tuxedo.
Gertrude
arrives for the wedding, and they lock eyes.
Richard waves hello
and mouths "Sorry."
He goes back inside.
96.
-- Geoffrey sits in his bedroom and watches TV.
He's not dressed
for the wedding yet.
Debbie shakes her head at him in the mirror
as she puts on her ear rings.
-- Gilbertson eats every hors d'oeuvre that's offered to him.
With the ocean in the background, 200 GUESTS sit in white chairs.
Richard stands under a gazebo, and smiles at his mother in the
front row.
He ignores Geoffrey.
Gertrude sits nearby, next to Gilbertson.
From the gazebo, Richard nods at a GROUP OF CELLO PLAYERS, who
begin playing from downloaded sheet music that reads "Kool and
the Gang, Cherish".
Heads turn with the start of the music, to
see Annie walk Margaret down the aisle.
When Margaret recognizes the song, she smiles.
MARGARET
(mouthing to Richard)
Nice song.
Richard shrugs his shoulders.
GRANDMA ANNIE
Is that your song, dear?
MARGARET
I guess so.
Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle.
Looking up,
Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone.
(Yes, the same
guy from the liquor store and the strip club.)
RAMONE
97.
GRANDMA ANNIE
It's me, Ramone.
Margaret gives Annie a kiss, and then turns to Richard.
They
whisper while they walk up to Ramone.
RICHARD
You look gorgeous.
MARGARET
(SMILING)
You look disgusting.
RICHARD
So, is this what you dreamed of when you
were a little girl?
MARGARET
Oh, you bet.
They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits.
MARGARET (cont'd)
Ramone.
RAMONE
(QUIETLY)
Mi amo.
(To the crowd)
We are gathered here today to celebrate one
of life's greatest moments.
To give
recognition to the beauty, honesty, and
unselfish ways...
Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's
looking straight ahead, determined to get through this.
RAMONE (cont'd)
...of Richard and Margaret's true love...
"True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the
audience notices.
RAMONE (cont'd)
...before their family and friends.
"Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and
Geoffrey.
She purses her lips.
He holds on to his chair in
order to keep himself seated.
RAMONE (cont'd)
For it is family and friends who taught
Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only
right that family and friends all celebrate
that love here today.
98.
RAMONE (cont'd)
And if there is anyone who has cause why
this couple should not be united in marriage
and love, they must speak now or forever
hold their peace.
Gilbertson stays quiet.
Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask.
Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention.
He's not sure what to do.
RAMONE (cont'd)
Mi amo, do you have a question?
We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted
shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself.
MARGARET
No.
RAMONE
Then why is your hand up?
MARGARET
I have something to say.
It's not a
question though.
RAMONE
Can it wait til after?
MARGARET
Uh.
Um.
No.
RICHARD
What are you doing?
Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd.
They
stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner.
MARGARET
Hey there, folks.
Thanks for coming out.
I've got a little announcement to make about
the "wedding."
RICHARD
Don't do this.
Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand.
MARGARET
Not sure the best way to tell you all this.
But, uh... I made Richard marry me.
This is
all a sham.
Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air.
99.
MARGARET (cont'd)
I was going to get kicked out of the country
-- so I told Richard that I would destroy
his career if he didn't marry me.
RICHARD
Now wait...
MARGARET
Richard.
Please.
Let me finish.
(to the Paxton family)
Richard wanted to stop this when we got off
the plane, but I wouldn't let him.
Don't
blame him.
This is all my fault.
(to Ramone)
Could you get the band started?
And give
these people something to drink.
(to Gilbertson)
And you.
Meet me at your dingy in ten,
you're taking me to the airport.
MR. GILBERTSON
You got it!
Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks
back up the aisle with all eyes on her.
She stops when she gets
to Gertrude and leans down.
MARGARET
Take care of him.
GERTRUDE
Promise.
Margaret walks back into the house.
Alone.
Margaret walks down to the dock carrying her suitcase.
She can
hear that the party is in full swing and smiles.
Gilbertson drives his little speedboat and Margaret holds her
suitcase tight.
It's choppy, and the outboard motor is loud.
The two have to yell to talk.
MR. GILBERTSON
I want you to say the words.
MARGARET
I'm not doing great in the dignity
department, can we not do this right now?
MR. GILBERTSON
Say it.
Margaret closes her eyes.
Hating that it's come to this.
MARGARET
I'll publish your book.
Gilbertson smiles.
MR. GILBERTSON
Now was that so hard?
Richard sits by himself and finishes a beer by the shore.
Gertrude walks up to him, looking fabulous, with two more beers.
GERTRUDE
So here's the deal.
I'm going to have a
million questions for you tomorrow...
Gertrude sits down next to Richard.
102.
GERTRUDE (cont'd)
...but for now I thought we'd just sit here
and drink beer.
OK?
Richard nods.
Gertrude hands him a beer.
RICHARD
Thanks.
Richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek.
Then, realizing
where and who he is with, he puts his beer down.
He turns to
Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the
lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss.
When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed.
Richard looks worried.
Something is wrong.
GERTRUDE
You have been practicing.
RICHARD
Waddya mean?
GERTRUDE
Well.
Margaret told me that you, uh, turned
into bit of a man whore down there.
Richard looks down.
A bit ashamed.
Gertrude makes light.
GERTRUDE (cont'd)
You're gonna have to put that in check if
you move back.
Cause me and Beth Cable are
the only two real options up here... and
I'll kick that bitch's ass.
Richard gives her a polite smile.
He's not really in the mood to
joke.
Gertrude notices.
GERTRUDE (cont'd)
So no jokes yet?
Too soon?
RICHARD
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little... confused.
GERTRUDE
That kiss didn't seem "confused."
Richard takes a beat to collect himself.
RICHARD
You're amazing, Gert.
And I've thought
about being with you for a long time.
A
long time.
When you said those things at
the school?
I've dreamed about hearing you
say those things.
(MORE)
103.
RICHARD
(cont'd)
But as crazy as this seems.
I know now...
that we're just not meant to be.
Gertrude pulls back like she's been punched.
RICHARD (cont'd)
Thing is... when I said goodbye to Margaret?
I felt sick.
For the three years we worked
together, I wanted to be as far away from
her as possible.
But now that she's gone?
I'm just really... sad.
I want her with me.
What is that?
The question hangs in the air.
GERTRUDE
I don't know.
RICHARD
I think I have to find out.
GERTRUDE
Find out what?
RICHARD
If she feels the same way.
Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry.
GERTRUDE
Well.
OK then.
What's a girl gonna do?
(voice cracking)
I guess you want who you want.
Gertrude gives a melancholy smile.
RICHARD
I'm so sorry.
(BEAT)
But, I gotta go.
GERTRUDE
Uh-huh.
Richard gets up.
RICHARD
Are you OK?
GERTRUDE
I'm fine.
Really.
Go.
Gertrude nods her approval and Richard runs off to the party.
104.
Debbie, Geoffrey and Annie sit at a table next to the bar,
dumbstruck looks on their faces.
Ramone mixes drinks and flips
bottles.
Richard runs up to them all, looking excited.
GEOFFREY
What are you so God damn happy about?
RICHARD
What?
Oh.
Well, I'm, uh, going to see
Margaret.
GEOFFREY
What?!
DEBBIE
She violated you.
We should report her.
RICHARD
Who you gonna report her to, mom?
DEBBIE
Oh my God.
He's got the Stockholm syndrome.
RICHARD
I don't have the Stockholm syndrome.
And
she didn't violate me.
DEBBIE
What is going on, Richard?
Richard slows down and explains to his mom.
RICHARD
I'm sorry I lied to you.
That was an awful
thing to do.
But it took this weekend for
me to see how funny, and screwed up and
perfect Margaret is for me.
I think
she's... the one.
DEBBIE
But you already thought she was the one.
RICHARD
No, I didn't.
Not until she left.
DEBBIE
Really?
Does she think that too?
RICHARD
I don't know.
I've got to get to the
airport to find out.
Debbie doesn't say anything, then breaks into a smile.
105.
DEBBIE
(so romantic)
He's going to stop her from leaving!
At the
airport!
RICHARD
But I gotta hurry.
Her plane leaves any
second.
I might not make it.
DEBBIE
(so romantic)
He's not sure he's going to make it!
GEOFFREY
Are you buying this horse shit?
DEBBIE
Oh, Geoffrey!
RICHARD
I don't have time to explain this to you.
GEOFFREY
Well then make some god-damn time.
Cause I
won't let you throw your life away for some
woman.
RICHARD
I don't care.
GEOFFREY
Excuse me?
RICHARD
I don't care.
I love you and want you to
understand.
But I'm not asking your
permission here.
I'm doing this.
GEOFFREY
Oh, really?
From behind them, Annie stands up and shouts.
ANNIE
Boys!
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!
But suddenly, a look of panic flashes across Annie's face.
She
grabs the table to steady herself, but pulls the table cloth,
causing a loud crash.
Geoffrey and Richard run over.
GEOFFREY
Mom, are you OK?
ANNIE
I'm having a... I need to go to the
hospital.
Fast.
106.
TWO COAST GUARDSMAN carry Annie on a gurney to their waiting
helicopter.
Geoffrey, Richard, and Debbie follow behind.
They
all pile into a large chopper and fly off.
The helicopter lands, and Richard jumps out.
His family follows
as they run to the control tower.
Richard and his family stand outside the tower and watch
Margaret's plane take off.
RICHARD
Well.
That's it.
Once she gets back to New
York, it'll be like this never happened.
Richard looks defeated.
Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and
takes a deep breath.
GEOFFREY
So, you know I think you shouldn't be with
Margaret, right?
RICHARD
You've made that crystal clear.
GEOFFREY
Good.
(looks at Annie)
Well, consider this me keeping my promise.
Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button.
He waits
for an answer.
GEOFFREY (cont'd)
(to phone)
Hey!
Maguire!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, her
running out was something.
But that's what
I'm calling about.
I've got a favor to ask
you, bout one of your planes...
Flight 1601 glides to a safe landing.
Richard and his family
wait on the tarmac, and the plane taxis to them.
A truck drives
stairs to the front door of the plane and the door opens.
Margaret steps out.
Richard walks up the steps.
MARGARET
This wasn't supposed to happen.
Richard looks Margaret in the eye.
RICHARD
But it did.
Margaret looks down.
A little embarrassed.
MARGARET
I'm not the kind of girl who gets saved.
Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and
plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him.
The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.
HANDSOME MAN
Uh, sorry, but excuse us.
The Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson
down the steps.
MARGARET
(to Gilbertson)
Hey!
Do you think getting arrested might
affect you at work?
Gilbertson has no retort.
115.
MARGARET (cont'd)
Oh, and I'm not going to be able to publish
your book after all.
MR. GILBERTSON
So you are getting married this weekend?
MARGARET
(SMILING)
Absolutely not.
But who knows?
(looking at Richard)
We might by the time you get out of jail.
Gilbertson makes a "go to hell" face and shuffles off.
Margaret turns back to Richard.
All smiles.
MARGARET (cont'd)
I've got some explaining to do.
Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of
Richard's family.
MARGARET (cont'd)
(to Debbie)
Hi.
I'm Margaret.
I've known your son for
years, but we've just recently begun to see
each other romantically.
(to Geoffrey)
I want to get to know you all, and spend
some real time up here in Alaska.
(to Annie)
I'm not sure when you are going to see him
get married, but I promise as long as I'm
with him, he'll be happy.
Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen.
GRANDMA ANNIE
That's all we ever wanted.
Grandma Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug.
Debbie joins
in.
Then Geoffrey.
Passengers cheer.
CUT TO:
The party is in full swing.
Balzac chases his balls.
Ramone slides onstage and SINGS with the band.
He has a
beautiful voice.
Debbie and Geoffrey cut a rug.
They've done this before.
116.
Gertrude and Annie chat and laugh at a nearby table.
The
Handsome Man brings Gertrude a drink.
Grandma Annie winks and
leaves these two alone.
Margaret and Richard dance.
All smiles, even though they aren't
very good.
And as everyone dances, we track up the tallest tree on the
island, to an eagle's nest at the very top.
Inside the nest,
three eaglets chirp along to the music, snuggled up to Margaret's
phone.
