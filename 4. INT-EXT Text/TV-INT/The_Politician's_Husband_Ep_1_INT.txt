      tracing a tremulous crack in a ceiling - it s in the shape 
      of A QUESTION MARK -

      A MAN lies in bed gazing up at it - he s not noticed the 
      crack before - AIDEN HOYNES - early forties - dynamic and 
      driven but a man not disenfranchised from his own humanity -

      His ALARM bleeps - startling him. He stabs it off - his 
      wife FREYA rouses.  He draws her to him - kisses her 
      forehead -

                                  FREYA
                    ...Is it time?

      He assents - his gaze drifts up to the QUESTION MARK again - 
      it disconcerts him without knowing why -

      DAY 

      Traffic laden street adjacent to COLLEGE GREEN - a MINISTRY 
      CAR is passing - Aiden is in the rear - his driver is KENNY 
      MOSS - solidly dependable if inclined towards self 
      importance -

                    has become the favoured euphemism 
                    for politicians to disguise their 
                    true motives for resigning -

      FREYA is present also - see her properly now - forty - ex 
      Oxford graduate - insightful intelligence lends her an 
      understated gravitas.  She knows all about side-lining 
      ambition for husband and family. She refuses to have rancour

                    - Aiden Hoynes and his wife Freya 
                    Gardner, junior Treasury Minister 
                    and a rising star in her own right - 
                    have two young children.  Often 
                    dubbed  The Golden Couple  the 
                    marriage is known to be solid but 
                    the demands of a political marriage 
                    are bound to put pressure on any 
                    family -


      She is emptying DESK DRAWERS into a CARDBOARD BOX - A 
      FAMILY PHOTOGRAPH is on the desk - AIDEN, FREYA and their 
      TWO CHILDREN - this too goes into her box -

      Aiden and Freya are now by the door - he, suddenly bereft, 
      looking back at his dismantled office. Freya glances at him, 
      slides her hand into his - 



      Aiden steps out to be greeted by an array of CIVIL 
      SERVANTS, ADVISERS and OFFICE STAFF - he halts by each one 
      to shake hands -  been a privilege, Minister   An honour, 
      sir  SECRETARIES fight tears - Kenny Moss is there also - 
      also DREW BAILEY, one of Aiden s SPECIAL ADVISERS - a 
      deceptively studious demeanour camouflages Teflon ambition -

                    And as Corleone said in the 
                    Godfather  a man who does not spend 
                    time with his family is not a real 
                    man  -

      As Aiden and Freya thread out - Leo leads THE STAFF in a 
      noisy round of APPLAUSE -

                    So perhaps we should take Aiden 
                    Hoynes at face value -  he will 
                    prove he is not only a real man - 
                    but a new man.

      BRUCE BABBISH emerges - early forties - sallow complexion - 
      scalpel sharp intellect masked by a supine confidence which 
      is acquired rather than congenital- a man who makes

      He takes the SUIT from her -

                    Mr. Speaker, for the past four 
                    years it has been my privilege to 
                    serve in My Right Honourable 
                    Friend s Government and share in 
                    the many advances we have

                    to you now because I owe the House, 
                    my constituents and indeed the 
                    country an explanation for my 
                    decision to resign -

      Bruce produces A HIP FLASK - proffers it - Aiden takes it, 
      has a swig - returns it - Bruce raises it in a toast -

                    To the end of the beginning.



      REPORTERS pounding up the corridor BLACKBERRIES in hand - 
      the BBC TELEVISION REPORTER among them -

                                  AIDEN 
                    - Mr. Speaker, too often the issue 
                    of immigration has been used as a 
                    political football fuelled by 
                    inflated statistics in the tabloids 
                    to appease anti-immigration 
                    prejudice in Britain-



      The packed hushed CHAMBER - Aiden is on his feet one row 
      from the back of the chamber on the Government side -   

                                  AIDEN
                    - So when the Prime Minister first 
                    mooted his proposal for an 
                      indefinite moratorium on 
                      immigration, I was deeply concerned 
                    that should he attempt to force 
                    such drastic reform through before 
                    the election next year -

      Freya is at one end of the FRONT BENCH.  As he speaks - she 
      is mouthing his words -

                    - Not only will it prevent 
                    skilled workers coming here we 
                    rely on for our desperately 
                    needed economic recovery - but it 
                    impeaches our humanitarian 
                      reputation in providing asylum 
                    for displaced people fleeing 
                    their own countries to escape 
                    death and persecution -

                    benefit tourism, pressure on local 
                    services and the effect of

                    So you can imagine how I felt, Mr 
                    Speaker, after months of complex 
                    and demanding work, when the Prime 
                    Minister suddenly told me he had 
                    resolved to include his immigration 
                      moratorium in his election 
                    manifesto without waiting for our

                                  AIDEN
                    I did my best to persuade My Right 
                      Honourable Friend that his 
                      unilateral decision would play into 
                    the xenophobic prejudice of those 
                    who seek to turn us into Fortress 
                    Britain ... 

      Leo and Drew exchange a wryly complicit look - 



      Aiden, on his feet addressing the HOUSE -

      Freya looks up at the PRESS GALLERY - the rapt faces of the

                                  AIDEN
                    Then what? We follow the example of 
                    the Dutch - put asylum seekers and 
                      immigrants on television Big 
                    Brother style? Let the audience 
                    decide who stays and who goes?  
                          (then)

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    Mr. Speaker, while I appreciate the 
                    Prime Minister s poor approval 
                    ratings are a matter of concern for 
                    him, his readiness to trample on 
                    human rights in a craven attempt to 
                    attract votes is of greater concern 
                    to me.  Add to this his lack of 
                    joined up thinking on the perilous 
                    state of our economy or any kind of 
                    coherent growth strategy to resolve 
                    it - 

      MP S on both sides, exchanging glances at this incendiary 
      statement -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    - I came to the reluctant 
                      conclusion that I could no longer 
                    accept my Right Honourable 
                    Friend s increasingly autocratic 
                    style of leadership.
                          (then)
                    I know some in the House will 
                    condemn my resignation is an act 
                    of disloyalty, Mr. Speaker. But I 
                    do so because it is the right 
                    thing to do. Because my loyalty 
                    lies not just to my Party, but to 
                    my country.  
                          (beat)
                    It is for others to decide where 
                    their own loyalty lies. 

      He takes his seat; the HOUSE sits in stunned silence - the 
      REPORTERS excitedly evacuate PRESS GALLERY - only Cliff 
      remains, thoughtfully gazing at Aiden as BACK BENCHERS reach 
      to clasp his shoulders in support -

      The Prime minister sits motionlessly, his face a mask.  
      Bruce nearby, sliding him a look -

      Freya, looks back at Aiden, fighting unshed tears of pride - 
      he meets her eyes -

                    Let me start by saying this. Aiden 
                    Hoynes is a close personal friend.  
                    I ve known him since University, he 
                    was Best Man at my wedding, I m 
                    Godfather to his children. I know 
                    him to be a man of steadfast

                    - He accused the Prime Minister of 
                    cynically using immigration as a 
                    vote catcher when arguably he s 
                    done the self same thing trying to 
                    peddle support for his ill judged 
                      leadership bid.

                    get my head round why he went ahead

      The empty TOILET - Aiden crashes in riding a tumult of 
      emotions. TWO suited APPARATCHIKS quickly zip up and exit. 
      A WASTE BIN is there - volcanic anger erupts - Aiden kicks 
      it - sending it spinning across the floor.

      CAMERA is slung low - a cavernous tunnel - an echo chamber

      mirth -


      DAY 

      - A DRIVER stands attentively by a MINISTERIAL CAR - Bruce

      him.  As the DRIVER circles the car to get behind the wheel 
      - the opposite rear passenger door opens - Aiden abruptly 
      gets in beside Bruce.

      The air molecules between them vibrate with tension - the 
      DRIVER spins in his seat in alarm -

                    Wait, that would be me.

      Bruce, a flicker of discomfort -

                    - So you just hung me out to dry?

      A depth of feeling in this - he constrains it.  Then, brutal 
      realization dawning -

                    Along it was for you.

      Bruce turns to meet his eyes in a glacial look - his tone 
      chillingly regretful.

                                  BRUCE
                    You take all the oxygen, Aiden. 
                    You always have.

      Bruce, arched in eye watering pain - Aiden abruptly 
      releases him - alights.   Bruce watches his receding 
      figure. Duncan gets back behind the wheel. Bruce catches 
      his curious gaze in the rear view mirror -

                                  NOAH
                          (puzzled)
                    Marching orders?  Are there 
                    soldiers there?

                                  JOE
                    ...It s an idiom, Noah.  Remember 
                    we talked about those?  When you 
                    don t take a phrase literally?

      Noah, not heeding this - his eyes fixed on his LAP TOP -

                                  NOAH 
                    Air Asia s changed the flight

                      connection on the Emirates flight

                                  JOE
                    - Does it have to be Lagos?  

                                  NOAH
                    It has to start with  L  to be in 
                      alphabetical order! Islamabad, 
                    Jakarta, Kuala Lumpa, Lagos -

      He fractiously jumps up, checks his WORLD MAP with FLIGHT 
      PATHS on it-

      He scurries back to his LAP TOP - suddenly the HOUSE 
      TELEPHONE start ringing - then the FRONT DOOR BELL - he 
      instantly freezes in panic - starts to pace flapping his 
      hands - Joe tries to calm him - 

                                  JOE
                    It s alright, Noah - they re not 
                    coming in. No-one s coming in -

      The BOY, still frantically flapping and pacing -

                                  JOE (CONT D) (cont d)
                    You want to get in your tent 
                    until they ve gone? 

      The BOY scrambles into his tent - looks back at Joe -

                                  NOAH 
                    ...Stay?                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  19


                                  JOE
                          (gently)
                    I m not going anywhere.

      The BOY closes the TENT FLAP -


      EVENING

      Falling light - Dita threads through the POSSE of REPORTERS 
      with a TRAY of TEA - flirtatiously laughing with them -

      Unseen by them, at a distance AN ESTATE CAR edges into view 
      - Aiden at the wheel, Freya beside him, dismay there as 
      they watch Dita -

                                  FREYA
                    Dear God, what is she doing?

                                  AIDEN
                    Snatching her fifteen seconds of 
                    fame.   
                          (then)
                    Go in, check on Noah, I ll get 
                    shot of them -

                                  FREYA
                          (firm)
                    No - 

      He glances at her -

                                  FREYA (cont d)
                    We have to be on message together 
                    on this - be seen together -

                                  AIDEN
                    And risk taking you down with me?  
                          (then)
                    ...Hasn t today cost us enough?

      She, touched by this.  She leans, kisses him, reluctantly 
      goes - he watches as she enters the DRIVE - the PRESS 
      promptly converge on her - she pushes through them - 
      grabbing Dita as she passes her - hustles her inside - 



      Noah, still in his TENT: Joe, sitting on the bed nearby. 
      Freya enters - Joe gestures to the tent - 

                                  JOE
                          (sotto)
                    Too much going on, you know how 
                    he gets...                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  20


      He exits - Freya crouches by the TENT - 

                                  FREYA
                    Noah, it s Mum - I m here now.

      She opens the flap - Noah sits inside, agitatedly rocking, 
      hands over his ears.  Freya, helpless compassion there. 



      Aiden, entering - a SEVEN YEAR OLD little GIRL runs from 
      the kitchen to greet him - Joe also steps into the hall -

                                  RUBY
                    Daddeee!  Daddy!

      The sight of her invigorates Aiden - he swings her up into 
      his arms -

                                  AIDEN
                    How s my Ruby?                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  21


      During this, Noah descends the stairs with Freya - he halts 
      at the sight of his FATHER holding Ruby -

                                  RUBY
                    You were on TV, Daddy - I saw 
                    you!

                                  AIDEN
                          (light)
                    No, no - it was someone who 
                    looked like me...

                                  RUBY
                    It was you, Daddy - you had the 
                    same tie!

      Aiden - lifts her above his head - she squealing in 
      delight. He swings her around singing the KAISER CHIEF S 
      song  RUBY,	  RUBY-  -  	  RUBY!  

      Noah, watching them. It s hard to decipher his expression. 
      He turns on his heel, ascends the stairs. 

      Joe observing this - he meets Freya s eyes -



      Joe, pouring shots of WHISKEY - Aiden is checking the LAND 
      LINE VOICE MAIL - a weariness of the soul evident now -

                    A story I used to tell my L.S.E. 
                      students...  ...  A Comintern 
                    agent radioed Vladivostok to 
                    relay a message to Stalin, 
                      requesting to blow up Hitler in 
                    some Munich cafe he frequented. 
                    Three times the agent radioed, 
                    three times Stalin never 
                      responded.  
                          (then)
                    He d made his own Faustian pact 
                    too.  In his case, his non 
                      aggression pact with Hitler.

      An acidic beat -

                                  AIDEN
                    Except there was no pact between

                    He s after a clear run for 
                    himself.

                    How the cabinet is full of 
                      ineffectual pigmies - only I had 
                    the X Factor to win us the 
                    election ..  And I bought every 
                    damn word!
                          (a different tone)
                    - So much for  moral paucity.  

                                  JOE
                    He s not the first to commit 
                    political fratricide is he? 
                    Milliband senior can testify to 
                    that.

      They sit in subdued silence; Aiden constraining emotion -

                                  AIDEN
                    ...It physically hurts, Dad.  It 
                    actually hurts.  

      This is plaintive - like the child he once was. Joe 
      reaches, clasps his son s hand. During this Dita appears at 
      the door, she stands tugging on her coat, looking at them 
      curiously.  

                                  DITA
                    I go out now, is it okay?

      Aiden abruptly pushes away from the table, turns his back.  
      Dita s gaze rests on him-

                                  DITA (cont d)
                    Freya asks you say good night to 
                    the children.

                                  JOE
                    He ll be right up.

      She reluctantly tugs her gaze from Aiden, goes.

      Aiden catches sight of the PINBOARD - he missed a 
      PHOTOGRAPH of BRUCE tucked behind a TAKE-OUT MENU.  He tugs 
      it out; it depicts he and Bruce walking along Downing 
      Street to Number 10.

                                  AIDEN
                     The villainy you teach me, I 
                    will execute and better your 
                      instruction. 

      Joe, disconcerted by the venom in this. Aiden scrunches the 
      PHOTOGRAPH, discards it in the PEDAL BIN -

      Joe, foreboding there now -                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  24



      A DOOR marked  RUBY  - Aiden withdraws -

                                  AIDEN
                    Sleep tight, precious girl.

      He steps across the hall, looks into Noah s room.  The BOY 
      is painstakingly drawing AIRLINE FLIGHT PATHS between WORLD 
      CITIES on his MAP. Each is meticulously labelled with the 
      AIRPORT CODE INITIALS -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    Ten minutes then bed, Noah.

      The BOY obsessively focused on his task with the MAP. 
      Aiden, fighting confliction. 

      He wordlessly withdraws.



      Joe, pulling on his COAT - Aiden seeing him out.  Joe 
      turns, meets his eyes, pulls him into a clumsy embrace.

                                  JOE
                    ...This too shall pass, son.

      The two of them, briefly lost in the moment. Joe 
      disengages, quickly goes.

      On Aiden -

                                  NEWSNIGHT PRESENTER (O.S.)
                    So, do you buy Aiden Hoynes s 
                    claim, that his resignation was 
                    that of a dissident?



      A FLAT SCREEN TELEVISION - NEWSNIGHT is on - Freya is in 
      bed watching it -

      A NEWSNIGHT PRESENTER there - a supine, suited POLITICIAN 
      there also - a veteran of Westminster s  real politik  -

      A CAPTION tells us he is MARCUS FITZWALLACE - CHIEF WHIP -

                                  MARCUS
                    At best he s being disingenuous - 
                    at worst duplicitous -

      Freya glances at the EN SUITE BATHROOM door - the sound of AN

                    When Robin Cook resigned, did he 
                    impugn Tony Blair s entire 
                      premiership?  No. He made it clear 
                    his resignation was over the single 
                    issue of Iraq -  

                                  NEWSNIGHT PRESENTER
                    --So Hoynes s resignation was more 
                    in the vein of Geoffrey Howe - 
                    which led to Thatcher s downfall?

                                  MARCUS
                    It s no coincidence he used 
                    virtually the same phrase  It s for 
                    others to decide where their

                    Instead of which - at the risk of 
                    mixing too many metaphors - he s 
                    put himself out in the wilderness.

      The sound of the ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH ceases, Freya quickly 
      changes CHANNELS to a MOVIE CHANNEL. Aiden enters, gets into 
      bed beside her. A hollow fatigue about him now. She threads 
      her fingers through his, clasps his hand.

                                  AIDEN
                    ...Don t go all mushy on me.

      She smiles: an hiatus.

                                  FREYA
                    Are you going to the climate 
                    change debate tomorrow?

      He doesn t respond.

                                  FREYA (cont d)
                    ...You have to show your face in 
                    the House, Aiden - show you re 
                    not cowed or -

                                  AIDEN
                            (overriding)
                    - I need to shore things up here 
                    first. Square the circle at the 
                      constituency.

      She, unconvinced. He reaches for his PHONE -

                                  FREYA
                    No tweeting, not tonight.                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  26


      She removes the PHONE - switches off the BEDSIDE LIGHTS - 
      nestles against him.  The only illumination, the flicker of 
      the TELEVISION -

                                  FREYA cont d) 
                    ...I ve the Select Committee 
                    first thing. Can you drop Noah 
                    off at school tomorrow?  

      Something in his face -

                                  FREYA
                    ...This could be a chance for you 
                    to spend more time with him, 
                    Aiden. 

                                  AIDEN
                    Must we have this conversation 
                    again now?

                                  FREYA
                          (light)
                    Oh, did we have it already this 
                    month?  Did I blink and miss 
                    that?

      He, his mood fracturing - 

                                  AIDEN
                    Pity s sake, Freya, not tonight.

      She - relenting - nestles to him - they lie a moment.

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    What a bitch of a day.

                                  FREYA
                    ...Not over yet, is it?

      She kisses him again - it takes a moment for him to 
      reciprocate - intimacy and tenderness intensify into 
      passion - he reaches for the REMOTE - turns off the 
      TELEVISION.

                                  AIDEN
                    You and your crap movies.

                                  FREYA
                          (mischievous)
                    How does it go?  What was it? ... 
                     I could have been a contender - 
                    I could have been somebody..  

                                  AIDEN

      He starts to tickle and rough house her - she responds - he 
      grabs her wrists - they are both aroused now -she looks 
      deeply at him - 

                                  FREYA
                    We ve got through worse. We ll get 
                    through this too.

      She kisses him, mutual passion escalates again - she rises to 
      sit astride him - their eyes meet in raw and cogent empathy -

                                  FREYA (cont d)
                    Lock and load, baby -

      And he does -



      - The RADIO burbling in a corner. The chaos of BREAKFAST - 
      Ruby in her school uniform shovelling BOOKS into a SCHOOL BAG 
      - Freya is multi-tasking - loading the dishwasher while 
      writing A SHOPPING LIST - 

      Aiden at the table, ploughing through a stack of NEWSPAPERS; 
      catch headlines - HOYNES FAILS IN LEADERSHIP BID - HOYNES 
      FAILS IN BID FOR POWER -

                                  FREYA
                    Why put yourself through it, 
                    they ll only depress you -

      He continues reading undeterred. Dita bustles in carrying 
      Ruby s SCHOOL COAT -

                                  DITA
                    Come Ruby - we go now!

      Ruby grabs her bag - Freya crosses to Dita - gives her A 
      SHOPPING LIST -

                                  FREYA
                    Shopping list.  Noah needs new

                    Aiden s dress suit needs picking up 
                    from the cleaners -

                    Ruby - Note for the school trip? - 

      She plucks up an ENVELOPE - Ruby runs back to fetch it - 
      spins off -                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  28


                                  FREYA (cont d)
                    Pack lunch?

      Ruby spins back again to get it - 

                                  RUBY
                          (as she goes)
                    Bye Daddy!

                                  AIDEN
                            (distracted)
                    Bye sweet.

      Ruby and Dita go - Freya leans out the kitchen door to call 
      out after Dita -

                                  FREYA
                    The car needs petrol - my card is 
                    in the glove box!  

      She turns to shout upstairs -

                                  FREYA (cont d)
                    Noah!!  Hurry up - you ll be late!

      Aiden, absorbed in the NEWSPAPERS - oblivious to the early 
      morning family mayhem - 



      The HOYNES CAR - nudging through TRAFFIC - Aiden at the 
      wheel - Noah beside him - he s playing with A TRANSFORMER 
      TOY, expertly rotating its parts - myopic focus there once 
      more - the RADIO is on -

                                  RADIO NEWSREADER

                      considering all the options -

      Aiden reaches to switch off the radio. Slides a cautious 
      look at Noah - 

                                  AIDEN
                    So ...what have you got in school 
                    today?

                                  NOAH
                    Just stuff.

                                  AIDEN
                    ...What kind of stuff? 

      Noah is silently gazing on a the flicking INDICATOR - The 
      CAR has reached TRAFFIC LIGHTS - Aiden has indicated left -                   THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  29


                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                          (gently)
                    It s a conversation, Noah. I ask 
                      questions, you answer, remember?

                                                                      NOAH S POV -

      FX - the  click click of the INDICATOR - eerily magnified 
      like a deafening pulse -

      Noah flashes a look out of the window - anxiety percolating - 
      his breathing sharpens -

      - Aiden pulls away from the lights - turns left -

      - Noah arches his body - lets out a gut wrenching howl -   

                                  NOAH
                    NO!  NO!  NO!!  NO!!!!!

                                  AIDEN
                    Jesus H! 

      He slams on the BRAKES - Noah howling like a wounded animal - 
      body rigid - hands flapping in panic - Aiden pulls the car 
      into the road-side - looks at his shrieking, flapping son - 
      tries to restrain his flailing hands -  

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    What did I do - what is it!

                                  NOAN
                    WRONG WAY - WRONG WAY - WRONG

                                  AIDEN
                    We avoid the traffic this way -

      The BOY still arched and howling  - No - No - No!!

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    Okay, okay!  We ll go the other 
                    way. Look, I m turning round - 
                    we re going the other way!

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Aiden s CAR - screeching into a THREE POINT TURN - heading 
      back the way it came - 


      AREA - DAY

      A modest INDEPENDENT SCHOOL behind wrought iron gates - KIDS 
      arriving - A TEACHER greets them at the entrance -                   THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  30


      Aiden s CAR pulls up outside.  He alights, crosses to open 
      the passenger door for Noah.

                                  AIDEN
                    Have a good day -

      He reaches to tousle the BOY S hair - Noah instantly jerks 
      away - physical contact disconcerts him - Aiden knows this 
      but the gesture cuts him nonetheless.   

      He stands watching as Noah trudges off.   His gaze rests on 
      the SCHOOL SIGN -  

      - WILLOW TREE HALL -  Unlocking the potential of children 
      with Autism - 

      Something in his face again -



      A motley crew of CONSTITUENTS lining the room.  A vast 
      NIGERIAN WOMAN among them, complete with HEAD DRESS.  She 
      sits, handbag on LAP, fingers ominously rippling -



        White-washed walls but the whiff of neglect about it.  
      NURSERY PARAPHERNALIA scattered beyond, KIDS PAINTINGS on the 
      walls.

      Aiden sits at a TRESTLE TABLE, a PARTY WORKER alongside him 
      taking notes.   Opposite him sit TWO FEMALE PENSIONERS.  This 
      is the highlight of their week.  He is braced for their usual 
      litany of complaints -

                                  IST PENSIONER
                    -- And there s another outside the 
                    Co-op.  Whole paving stone gone 
                    missing, just a gaping hole.

                                  AIDEN
                    Did you call the council?

                                  IST PENSIONER
                    Waste of breath that was. Press one 
                    for this.  Two for that.                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  31


                                  2ND PENSIONER
                    And there s another missing outside 
                    the Post Office.

                                  IST PENSIONER
                    When it was a post office.

      Aiden s face -

                                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

      The door plunges open - the NIGERIAN WOMAN strides up to 
      Aiden s DESK -

                                  BLACK MOTHER
                    Mr. Hoynes  ... I have only this to 
                    say to you -

      He braces himself once again -

                                  BLACK MOTHER (cont d)
                    That immigration ban they are 
                    trying to pull? Thank God there is 
                    one politician who s not on the 
                    take, who s not lost his values. If 
                    there were more like you, this 
                    country would not be going to hell 
                    in a hand basket.   
                          (then)
                    Bless you for your courage, sir.  

      She extends her hand, clasps his, goes -

      He, a stab of discomfort there -



      - A blur of APPARATCHIKS - the PORTRAITS of PAST PRIME 
      MINISTERS adorning the stair well. CHIEF WHIP Marcus 
      Fitzwallace descends the stairs - Bruce is with him. 

      They halt at the bottom to exchange a few conspiratorial 
      words - Fitzwallace -  leave it with me  - he sets off down 
      the hall, Bruce speculatively watching him - 



      A SECURITY TUBE entrance to the adjoining house at number 9 - 
      Marcus steps into it - one side closes - the other opens -

      He steps out, continues on his way  -                   THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  32



      - Modest book lined grandeur - Fitzwallace enters - sits at 
      his desk gathering his thoughts; he keys up A CONTACT list on 
      his COMPUTER -  

      Reaches for the TELEPHONE -



      A flower flecked Freya is making A CAKE with Ruby, stirring 
      the ingredients in a bowl.  Dita is beyond at the sink- she 
      reaches for the PHONE -

                                  DITA (INTO PHONE)
                    Hoynes residence, Dita speaking?
                          (then)
                    Who?  ....Wait please -

      She holds out the PHONE to Freya -

                                  DITA (cont d)
                    ...Marcus Fitz-someone?

      Freya, barely glancing up from the cake stirring -

                                  FREYA
                      Fitzwallace ...  It s Aiden he ll 
                    want - tell him to try his mobile.

                                  DITA
                    It is you he asked for.

      Freya, puzzled at this.  She wipes her hand, takes the phone - 
      moves to another part of the kitchen - 

                                  FREYA (INTO PHONE)
                    Freya Gardner?  .....  

      The CALL is TWO WAY with Fitzwallace in his OFFICE -

                    Bad moment?

                                  FREYA (INTO PHONE)
                    Not at all.  What can I do for you, 
                    Marcus?

      Hold on her as she listens; her expression alters -

                                  FREYA (INTO PHONE) (cont d)
                    ...Sorry - say again?                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  33



      The FRONT DOOR - the sound of a KEY - Aiden enters - he pulls 
      up - Freya is sitting on the stairs - 

      Something in her face halts him -

                                  FREYA
                    There s been a... development.



      Aiden - tensely - agitatedly pacing - Freya watching him -

                                  AIDEN
                    - Again - exactly as he said it -

                    from Work and Pensions - take over

                    - The P.M. wants to know my 
                    response should I be offered Work 
                    and Pensions - but with the proviso-

                                  AIDEN
                    - You publicly support him over the

                                  FREYA
                    In other words - publicly humiliate 
                    you.
                          (then)
                    I m to think it over, let him know 
                    my decision in the morning. 

      Aiden - trying to fathom all this -

                                  FREYA (cont d)
                    - And it s not just about 
                      humiliating you, is it? - it s 
                    about politically isolating you..! 
                    What better way than to show your 
                    own wife won t even support you? 
                    ...Why else choose me?                   THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  34


      Aiden, still wrestling with the logic of it-

                                  AIDEN
                    Because you re far and away the 
                    best woman at Minister of State 
                    level and everyone knows it.  
                    ...The press are always banging on 
                    about the gender balance in 
                      cabinet... He overlooks you, he ll 
                    be accused of petty revenge and 
                    misogyny - how will that play with 
                    the women voters?

      A beat.

                                  FREYA
                    Risky little game.  What if I took 
                    the damn job?

                                  AIDEN
                    There is no risk is there?  He 
                    knows you ll reject it out of 
                    loyalty to me.  By making the offer 
                    he looks statesmanlike and 
                      magnanimous, he s off the hook. 

      Freya, assimilating this - beyond, Ruby can be heard 
      shouting.

                                  RUBY (O.S.)
                    Mummy!  Noah....pulled my hair and 
                    spitted at me!

      Freya moves to Aiden, hastily kisses him - 

                                  FREYA
                    ...I ll call Fitzwallace in the 
                    morning, tell him to shove his 
                    offer up his wool sack.



      Dawn light filtering through the shuttered curtains. The 
      tremulous QUESTION MARK crack in the ceiling like an arterial 
      vein - 

      Aiden in the bed, gazing up at it; it resonates with him.

      He glances at Freya asleep beside him, eases out of bed -



      A light snaps on - a well appointed OFFICE - a HIGH TECH 
      clutter of office gear - A PHOTO COPIER - FAX MACHINE -

      International CLOCKS, MAPS of Aiden s constituency showing 
      the various WARDS - shelves laden with POLITICAL MEMORABILIA -

      - Aiden is there in a dressing gown. He opens A DRAWER - tugs 
      out a BOX of CHEROOT CIGARS.  He halts, arrested by FRAMED 
      PICTURES on the wall.

      IMAGES of he and BRUCE - flanking PRESIDENT OBAMA on the 
      steps of WESTMINSTER HALL - with DESMOND TUTU at a formal 
      DINNER - seated side by side at the CABINET table with the 
      P.M., Fitzwallace among the MINISTERS -  

      Aiden, his gaze on Bruce, glistening animosity there -



      The darkened bedroom - the PHONE ringing by the bed - Freya 
      rouses from sleep - gropes for it -

                    Yes?  .....

      Aiden is standing there, his back turned.  As Freya enters, 
      he turns, meets her eyes -

                                  AIDEN
                    Just run with this, okay? 
                          (then)
                    You call Fitzwallace in the 
                    morning, tell him you ve discussed 
                    his offer with me, I won t stand in 
                    the way of such a fantastic 
                      opportunity for you.
                          (beat)
                    So you will accept the post and 
                    agree to the condition on the 
                      immigration issue -

      She, uncertain she is hearing this right -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    - By accepting the job the P.M. 
                    will assume you ve put ambition 
                    ahead of your loyalty to me, won t

                    You work with that, use it to win 
                    his trust --  Then, when the time 
                    is right - choose your venue -

                                  AIDEN
                    He can t fire another Cabinet 
                    minister - especially my own wife - 
                    over the same issue, without 
                    looking petulant and vindictive!    
                    He ll play into the hands of his 
                    critics that your appointment was 
                    just gender tokenism!  Further 
                    proof that he runs the Cabinet like 
                    his personal fiefdom, crushing 
                    dissent, briefing against anyone 
                    opposing him -

      She, still trying to keep pace with all this -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    You publicly challenge him on a 
                    crucial part of his manifesto, you 
                    challenge both his authority and 
                    his credibility -

                    A long shot at best.

                                  AIDEN
                    Still a shot.

      A beat.

                                  FREYA
                    It ll just open the way for Bruce

                                  FREYA
                    - But he has the inside track with

                    And I have you on the inside, 
                    tracking him.

      She, as this impacts.  She sinks to a seat-

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    - You play the ambition card with 
                    him too.  God knows he ll relate to 
                    that!  Find out who s in his cabal, 
                    who s on the fence, who s funding 
                    him -

                    trotting home to leak it all back 
                    to you.

                    - A Downing Street source said  the 
                    Prime Minister has long since 
                      recognized Ms. Gardner s 
                      outstanding potential and does not 
                    regard Aiden Hoynes recent actions 
                    as an impediment to realizing that 
                      potential ...

      Dita sets down a plate of scrambled eggs in front of Noah who 
      promptly starts rocking in distress -

                                  RUBY
                    They re touching, Dita!  His eggs 
                    and toast - he doesn t like it when 
                    they touch! 

      Dita resignedly returns, separates the eggs from the toast.

                                  DITA
                    Enough fuss, eat. 

      She bustles off.  The BOY still rocking and whimpering -



      A tense Freya, in stockinged feet, shirt and pencil skirt, 
      trying on various JACKETS; Aiden in T SHIRT and PYJAMA 
      BOTTOMS is selecting various JACKETS for her to try on.

                                  AIDEN
                      Confidence is the key. The second 
                    you step inside the department, 
                    don t let the mask slip, not to 
                    anyone.  Kevin Russell is your 
                    Permanent Secretary - old school 
                    but no-body s fool. Insist on a 
                      structured induction, don t let him 
                    bounce you into decisions before 
                    you re fully briefed...                    THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  43


      During this her MOBILE bleeps a text message -

                                  FREYA
                    Another well wisher.  Who knew I 
                    had so many friends?

                                  AIDEN
                          (caustic)
                    Get used to it.

      He gives her a BLACK JACKET to try - briefly inspects her -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    Too funereal...

      He reaches for another -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    When you arrive, remember to 
                    connect personally with all the 
                    staff, especially those who could 
                    be toxic. ..But don t ignore the 
                    ones lower down the food chain. 
                    They re your shock absorbers - the 
                    keepers of your secrets -

      She has put on a PURPLE JACKET - spins for his approval -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    Better -

      He catches sight of her LEOPARD PATTERN SHOES -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    Shoes are too Theresa May -

      She kicks them off, he selects a more sedate pair - stoops to 
      slide her feet into them. She looks down at him, touched at 
      his solicitude -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    And if you need something doing, 
                    forget appealing to their altruism. 
                    Appeal to their self interest  -


      Freya, BRIEF CASE in hand, being ushered into the LIMO by 
      Kenny.  Aiden, watching her.  She waves to him - the CAR 
      pulls away.

      Aiden s expression alters; this is harder than he thought.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      TREMBLING LENS of a PAP CAMERA fixed on the dishevelled 
      pyjama clad figure of Aiden gazing after the departing car - 
      SNAP! SNAP!                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  45



      The TODAY programme burbles - the chaos of breakfast again - 
      kitchen is a debris of school paraphernalia - a LAUNDRY bin 
      on the kitchen table - Ruby is trying to use a HULA HOOP - a 
      harassed Aiden (now dressed) is ferrying dishes into the 
      dishwasher. Noah sits on the floor in the corner of the room, 
      myopically playing with his TRANSFORMER -

                                  AIDEN
                    Not in here, Ruby, okay?

      She ignores him, keeps spinning the HOOP - Dita enters -

                                  DITA
                    Ruby - we go!  Come!

      Ruby tugs on her SCHOOL COAT - Dita looks over at Aiden -

                                  DITA (cont d)
                    Pack lunch?

      He, askance -

                                   AIDEN
                    ...She can have school dinner 
                    today.

                                  RUBY
                    School dinners are yucky!

                                  AIDEN
                    No time to do your pack lunch now.

      She clamps her lips in a sullen line -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    It s one time, Ruby.  Deal with it.

                                  DITA
                    School bag?

      He casts about for it - hands it over.

                                  DITA (cont d)
                    She has ballet today -

      Aiden spins to locate the BALLET SHOES- passes them also - 
      Dita exits with Ruby -  

      Aiden turns back into the kitchen -  his gaze rests on Noah 
      hunched in the corner, obliviously hunched over his 
        TRANSFORMER.

      Aiden - his heart sinks at the sight - he wishes it were 
      otherwise -                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  46



      Fingers anxiously strumming a BRIEF CASE - they belong to 
      Freya in the rear of the CAR, constraining nerves.

      Kenny glances at her in the rear mirror - empathy there.



      The click click of Freya s heels as she approaches up the 
      corridor.

      The ENTRANCE to DWP lies ahead.  She braces herself, enters -



      Freya - entering.  The FULL COMPLIMENT of DWP Staff are there 
      - a storm of rapturous applause greets her led by Leo and 
      Drew. A SECRETARY approaches with A BOUQUET of FLOWERS - 

      Freya - moved by the unexpected warmth of their reception -


      AREA - DAY

      The ivy clad SCHOOL - KIDS arriving with PARENTS - THE 
      TEACHER at the entrance greeting them - 

      Aiden alights from his car, opens the passenger door for 
      Noah. 

                                  AIDEN
                    Have a good one, eh?

      He reaches to tousle the boy s head.  Once again, Noah jerks 
      out of his reach - traipses off towards the SCHOOL -

      On Aiden -



      The familiar row of CONSTITUENTS patiently waiting their 
      turn.  The TWO PENSIONERS among them, sharing a FLASK of TEA 
      and a SUDOKU puzzle. 

      Through the GLASS DOORS beyond Aiden can be seen in the 
      CHURCH HALL dealing with an angrily gesticulating  
      CONSTITUENT - 



      Dita, at a window. She s watching Aiden by the HOUSE GATES 
      stretching after his run.  Is it desire in her face - or a 
      trick of the light?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Aiden, glazed in sweat, stretching.  He senses he is being 
      observed, looks up at the house.  

      Dita has gone.  It s like she was never there.



      O.S. the sound of CBBC on TELEVISION - also the whirr of a 
        PHOTOCOPIER.

      Aiden freshly showered, descends the stairs.  The PHONE in 
      the kitchen is ringing.  Dita answers it -

                                  DITA (INTO PHONE)
                    Hoynes residence?  Ms. Gardner is 
                    not here at present..  Mr. Hoynes 
                    is here if you...
                          (beat)
                    He s right here if you --
                          (then)
                    Ok, I will get her to call you.                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  50


      She glances at Aiden in the doorway -

                                  DITA (cont d)
                    Deputy Prime Minister -

      Aiden, it s only a minor humiliation but the first cut is the 
      deepest.  

      He catches the sound of the COPIER.  He glances into the 
      STUDY -

      Noah is there stooped over the PHOTO COPIER, fractiously 
      flapping as he watches realms of COPY flop out of the COPIER.

      Aiden, this impacts also.



      Modest Georgian grandiosity; Freya and Marcus Fitzwallace pad 
      up the corridor towards us -

                                  MARCUS
                      --Thrilled to have you on board - 
                    always said we d neglected you too 
                    long  --

      They reach A DOOR -

                                  MARCUS (cont d)
                    I ll tell him you re here.

      He indicates a chair - enters the DOOR - glimpse the 
      fractious figure of the PRIME MINISTER within surrounded by 
      ACOLYTES.  Freya sits, prepares to wait.  THE CABINET ROOM is 
      nearby - the DOOR is ajar - the BOAT SHAPED TABLE can be seen 
      within -

      Her face.                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  51



      The empty CABINET room.  Freya cautiously nudges the door 
      open, enters.  She crosses to the table, her fingers brush 
      the surface of the TABLE in gossamer contact -  

      She circles to a CHAIR opposite the PRIME MINISTER S CHAIR,   
      pulls it out, sits.  She spreads her hands on the table as if 
      communing with history -

      So this is what the thermal of power feels like -



      Aiden at the wheel, Noah beside him, working his TRANSFORMER.

                                  NOAH
                    The O s were easy - Ohau, Oakland, 
                    Oamani - and they all have 
                    airports.  Q s are okay too, like 
                    loads of them to choose from - 

                                  AIDEN
                          (gently)
                    - Didn t Mum make a rule, how you 
                    can only talk about the airport 
                    thing at home?  Nowhere else?

      The BOY, his eyes obscured his glasses -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    You know why she made that rule?  
                    To free up your brain to think 
                    about other things.  

      Noah, wordlessly working his TRANSFORMER -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                          (persevering)
                    Because if you focus on just one 
                    thing all the time, your brain gets 
                    stuck on it. That s how it turns 
                    into an obsession...
                          (beat)
                    Shall we talk about something else?  
                    You choose, any subject you want.                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  52


      Noah, apparently pondering on this -  Aiden glances at him -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    Anything you like, up to you.

      Suddenly Noah starts to tunelessly sing - it s the Kaiser 
      Chiefs song  RUBY,	  RUBY-  -  	  RUBY!  -

                                  NOAH
                    -- Ruby, Ruby, Ruby - do you know 
                    what you're doing to me -- Ruby, 
                    Ruby, Ruby, Ruby  

      On Aiden - the implications of this impact -



      AN INNER PAGE of THE MAIL - A PHOTOGRAPH of the pyjama clad 
      AIDEN there on his door step - the caption reads -  FROM 
      POWER HOUSE to HOUSE HUSBAND  -

      Pull back to reveal BRUCE reading it; he s at a TABLE for TWO 
      in a discreet corner of the restaurant.  

      Beyond the swish of WAITERS - a blur of DINERS scattered 
      around white starched TABLES - Freya enters, spots Bruce, 
      threads to join him.

      He quickly stows the PAPER, rises to greet her; a glacial 
      formality about her.

                                  BRUCE
                    Good to see you.

      She sits - arranges her napkin and her features. 

                                  FREYA
                    How re Wanda and the kids?

                                  BRUCE
                    All in the vertical and free from 
                      infection. 

      She doesn t rise to this attempt at humour. An awkward 
      hiatus.                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  53


                                  BRUCE (cont d)
                    We have more in common than divides 
                    us, Freya.

      She, coolly quizzical -

                                  BRUCE (cont d)
                    Our two departments have adjacent 
                      interests.  
                          (beat)
                    If we re to work together 
                      effectively, we have to find a way 
                    of putting aside our personal 
                    issues.

                                  FREYA
                    Is that what you call it?

      He s spared from replying by the arrival of the WAITER -

                                  FREYA (cont d)
                    Salad Nicoise -

                                  BRUCE
                    Calves Liver. Rare. Extra Spinach, 
                    hold the fries.

      The WAITER departs; an hiatus.

                                  BRUCE (cont d)
                    The week before Aiden resigned, he 
                    stayed over at my London flat -

                                  FREYA
                          (flat)
                    - To discuss strategy, he told me.

                                  BRUCE
                    Did he also tell you I warned him 
                    against it?  I d taken soundings, 
                    the omens weren t good?  He d find 
                    himself dangerously exposed?

      She, disbelieving -

                                  BRUCE (cont d)
                    He was on this ...adrenaline rush - 
                    like an actor in a play whose lost 
                    sight of the plot --
                          (beat)
                      I couldn t get through to him. I 
                    couldn t reach him. 

                                  FREYA
                    Curious he never mentioned any of 
                    that to me.
                          (a different tone)
                                  (MORE)                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  54

                                  FREYA (cont'd)
                    Or - given your concern - you 
                    didn t call to give me a heads up - 

                                  BRUCE
                    - I wish now I bloody had called 
                    you.  It seemed ... disloyal.

      She, constraining impatience -

                                  FREYA
                    And publicly shafting him wasn t?

                    You could have done a Pontius 
                    Pilot, Bruce, refused to comment.

                                  BRUCE
                    He and I were too close.  If I 
                    hadn t come out publicly against 
                    him, I was guilty by association.  
                    ...What was I supposed to do?  
                    Commit political Kamikaze along 
                    with him?
                          (then)
                    If you think I did it lightly, 
                    think again. I knew we d never get 
                    back from it.  
                          (then)
                    Like cutting off my right arm.  

      Emotion in this; but her scepticism is still apparent - he 
      sees this, artfully changes tack-

                                  BRUCE (cont d)
                    He has this...  sense of 
                      entitlement.  As if the world owes 
                    him something.
                          (then)
                    I don t know if it s about Noah 
                    or...    

      He slides her a look to see if this impacts on her - it has -

                                  BRUCE (cont d)
                    When I put your name forward to the 
                    P.M. - even though it s a chance in 
                      a lifetime for you - I was afraid 
                    he d veto it. 
                          (beat)
                    Or even if you took the job, he d 
                    try to use you to get back at me 
                    somehow.  
                          (a different tone)
                    I should have known he cares too 
                    much for you, to put you in such an 
                    invidious position. 

      This impacts on her also.  She deflects -                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  55

                    Just why did you put my name 
                    forward, Bruce?  To assuage your 
                    guilt?

      A beat.

                                  BRUCE
                    I ve lost count how many times you 
                    stepped aside for him over the 
                    years.  When that shadow Transport 
                    job came up, you had a shot at it 
                    too. But you ruled yourself out for 
                    him.  Same later with environment.   
                          (then)
                    And he let you do it. Every time.   

                                  FREYA
                    It wasn t for him. I have a family 
                    to -

                                  BRUCE
                    - It s his family too.

      This too finds its mark.  The WAITER returns with BREAD and 
      OLIVES.  Bruce allows him to clear before speaking again -

                                  BRUCE (cont d)
                    ...As I told him that night in the 
                    flat, a leadership bid isn t just 
                    about hubris, it s about picking 
                    your allies.   
                          (then)
                    If a week is a long time in 
                    politics, a year is a lifetime.  
                    ....In the end you re only as good 
                    as the support you have. 

      This too finds its target -



      Aiden is in the bath, Freya in her night clothes is at the 
      basin -

      He reaches for some NAIL CLIPPERS - holds them out to her.

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    Can you?

      She takes the CLIPPERS -it s hard to read her expression - he 
      rests a foot on the side of the bath as she starts to clip 
      his TOE NAILS -

                    You need to start a paper trail.  
                    Texts at first - he ll feel safe 
                    with those.  Then ramp them up into 
                    e mails - get the time frame on his

                    Get him on paper, we leak it to the

      She, her expression still indecipherable -

                    I m tempted to hide a camera on

                    P.M., put it on You Tube that would 
                    nail his treacherous sorry arse!

      Catching her face -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    - I m kidding, obviously.

      On Freya.



      Freya, now in bed. O.S. the unappetising sound of AIDEN 
      gargling in the bathroom -

      She, gazing up at the QUESTION MARK in the ceiling -



        A BROADSHEET WEB SITE fills the screen - Cliff Lyman s 
      article there - a picture of FREYA -  OUT FROM HER HUSBAND S 
      SHADOW  -

      Aiden is at his COMPUTER, reading it.  He flicks to another 
      WEB SITE - locates another PICTURE of Freya, waving and 
      smiling on the steps of NUMBER TEN -

      He locates another WEB SITE - a PICTURE of MINISTERS smiling 
      into CAMERA, sitting at the BOAT SHAPED CABINET TABLE - Freya 
      there sitting next to Bruce -                   THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  57


      The discomforts him --

      Aiden s gaze drifts up to the FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of he and 
      Bruce with other MINISTERS seated around the CABINET TABLE -

      Unseen by him, Dita has arrived in the doorway.  She just 
      stands, watching him - she coughs discreetly.  He flashes her 
        a distracted look.   

                                  DITA
                    I go to the shops.  Is there 
                    anything you need?

      He dissents.  Still she stands there - he flicks her a look.

                                  AIDEN
                    I m good, thanks.

      She seems about to speak, thinks better of it, goes. His 
      PHONE rings - the call is TWO WAY with Freya approaching up 
      the cavernous tunnel to PORTCULLIS HOUSE - 

                                  FREYA (INTO PHONE)
                      ...Someone s baled out of tonight s 
                    QUESTION TIME -  Number 10 asked 
                    asked me to step in...

      Aiden, assimilating this - her BLACKBERRY starts ringing - 

                                  AIDEN (INTO PHONE)
                    The PM knows you ll get asked about 
                      supporting me on the immigration 
                    issue - he s trying to flush you 
                    out...

                    I can t refuse to go on, can I?

      A beat.

                                  AIDEN (INTO PHONE)
                    Then it s carpe diem.  You do the 
                    deed tonight.   

      She - dismayed - during this, fumbling for her BLACKBERRY in 
      her bag - checks the CALLER I.D. -

                    - I ll call you back -

      She disconnects from Aiden, he - a stab of frustration there.                   THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  58

                    No, it s fine...  On my way.

      She disconnects - turns on her heel spins back the way she 
      came.



      Marcus Fitzwallace at his desk disconnecting the call also.  
      Bruce lounges against a bookcase.

                                  MARCUS
                    Best make yourself scarce.  
                    ...Don t want her thinking its a 
                    pincer movement, do we? 

      Bruce gives a wry salute; some GRAPES are in a bag on 
      Marcus s desk.  

      Bruce reaches for one, lobs it to catch it in his mouth, 
      swings out.



      Freya is approaching up the corridor. She halts outside the 
      CHIEF WHIP S OFFICE - knocks - 

                                  MARCUS (O.S.)
                    Come!

      She enters -



      Ruby, drawing at the kitchen table.  Dita is at the sink 
      washing up.  She is looking out of the window -

      Her POV: Aiden is pacing in the garden on his MOBILE -



      A BCU of RUBY RED LIPS fill the screen -

      Pull back to reveal a tense FREYA in front of a MIRROR as A 
      MAKE-UP ARTIST tends to her -

      Her MOBILE rings, she checks the caller I.D.  Aiden calling

      She meets her eyes in the mirror -



      The AUDIENCE raggedly arriving to take their seats:  
      TECHNICIANS running SOUND and CAMERA tests -



      The CORRIDOR - a mayhem of CABLES and MORE TECHNICIANS - A 
      FLOOR MANAGER threads Freya through it to some DOORS; a RED

                    Hang here one sec, can you?

      He hustles through the DOORS.  She leans against the wall, 
      flushed in terrible confliction -

                    Was Aiden Hoynes correct when he 
                    said the Prime Minister s 
                      moratorium on immigration plays 
                     into xenophobic prejudice of those 
                    who seek to turn us into Fortress

      She halts - paralysed in uncertainty -



      Bruce fingers steepled, watching Freya on the TELEVISION in 
      his office - Marcus is there also -



      - Aiden and Joe, also fixed on the TELEVISION image of Freya -

                                  FREYA (TV)
                    Having said that ... Ordinary 
                    working people - and indeed those 
                    not in work - are understandably 
                    concerned about the pressure 
                      immigration places on housing, 
                    hospitals and other public 
                    services. -

                    merely cynical vote catching 
                    exercise is completely untrue. It s 
                    a long overdue response to the very 
                    real anxiety the majority of people 
                    in the country feel about the whole

                    someone, it doesn t mean you don t 
                    respect their right to an opinion 
                    does it? 

                                  DIMBLEBY (TV)
                    - We ll take that as a  no  then.

      Guffaws and laughter greets this. Aiden, the GLASS of RED 
      WINE he s gripping shatters in his hand -

      CUT TO - blood, dripping on the carpet -



      Joe and Aiden by the sink, A FIRST AID BOX there.  Joe is 
      wrapping a GAUZE and LINT BANDAGE round Aiden s cut hand.  He 
      glances at his son, trying to assess his mood.  

                                  JOE
                    By rights a doctor should check it. 
                    You might need stitches.

      Aiden doesn t respond. The BANDAGING is complete now.  Joe 
      stows the FIRST AID BOX away.

                                  AIDEN
                    Best leave me to my own devices, 
                    Dad.

      A beat.

                                  JOE
                    I can t, not like this.

      Aiden musters a smile -

                                  AIDEN
                    It s politics.  The survival of the 
                      unfittest.  She did what she had to 
                    do. 
                          (then)
                    Get on home, Dad.  I m good, 
                    really.

      Joe, unconvinced.  Aiden starts to load the DISHWASHER.  Joe 
      watches him a moment, reluctantly scoops up his coat.

                                  JOE
                    I ll call by tomorrow.                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  63


      Aiden doesn t respond, intent on the business with the 
      dishes.  Joe exits.  

      O.S. the sound of the FRONT DOOR closing.  Aiden straightens 
      up, stands motionlessly, his back to us.



      Noah, jerking and restless in sleep, he s still wearing his 
      GLASSES.   

      Aiden stands gazing down at him, fighting a welter of 
      emotion, the BANDAGE wrapped round his hand.  He reaches, 
      carefully removes the boy s glasses, places them on the 
      bedtable.

      The WINDOW is ajar.  He crosses to close it, stands gazing 
      out at the darkness.

      His face, reflected in the blackened window; his eyes, 
      glistening with unshed tears -



      Freya in the rear, infused in trepidation.  

      Kenny, watching her in the rear view mirror.  She looks 
      through the window at the house much as one might an 
      adversary.  She gathers resources, reaches for her RED BOXES.

                                  FREYA
                      Goodnight, Kenny.

                                  KENNY
                     Night, Minister.

      She alights from the CAR.  He watches as she approaches the 
      house - his expression indecipherable.



      Pools of shadow; the sound of a key in the door.  Freya 
      enters.  She sets down THE RED BOXES, stands listening.  

      The HOUSE is silent.  She, a temporary reprieve is better 
      than nothing.

      She tugs off her COAT, slings it over the BANISTERS, crosses 
      to the kitchen -                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  64



      The darkened kitchen.  Freya snaps on the light - recoils.

      Aiden is sitting at the KITCHEN TABLE, nursing a WHISKEY.

      Their gaze locks -

      - When you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back at you -
