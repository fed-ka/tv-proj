      through the window of Stiles s Jeep. He glances back to the 
      worried boy driving beside him.

                    Oh, don t feel so bad. If she lives 
                    she'll turn into a werewolf. She'll

      Stiles throws him a glare of pure hatred and pushes the pedal 
      to the floor.

      Main Title: TEEN WOLF


      A LAMP HURTLES across the room, SMASHING into the fireplace. 
      Argent clenches his fists, trying not to grab something else. 
      Kate watches him seethe, clearly enjoying it.

                                  KATE
                    Feel better?

                                  ARGENT

                    I thought that was a pretty healthy 
                    display of aggression, actually.

                    She found out.

                                  ARGENT
                    Don t think I don t know about the 
                    little clues you ve been leaving.

                                  KATE
                    Because she needs to. From what I 
                    hear, Scott s brown eyes were 
                    glowing a distinct shade of yellow 
                    tonight. Correct?

      Argent studies Kate s expression, almost like he s trying to 
      read the motives underneath.

                                  ARGENT
                    Why did you come back here? You 
                    hate this town. I had a network of 
                    names I could have called on a lot 
                    closer than you. But you called 
                    first.

                                  KATE
                    You don t want my help now?

                                  ARGENT
                    I m not sure I know who you re 
                    helping.

                                  KATE

                    I came here to catch an Alpha. 
                    Remember? The one killing people at 
                    random?

      Calmer now, Argent begins to pick up the pieces of the lamp.

                                  ARGENT
                    Not at random.

                    Then that s even more reason for 
                    her to know. They always blamed us 
                    for the fire. It s got to be Derek 
                    and some other relative. And I 
                    guarantee they re circling around 
                    to us as their last targets.

                                  ARGENT
                    I know. Which is why you re taking  
                    Allison out of here tonight.

                                  KATE
                    That s a particularly  not open for

                    You re going to drive her to the 
                    house in Washington and stay there 
                    until I call.

                                  KATE
                    Are you kidding me? Bench your star 
                    player in the last quarter?

      Argent dumps the pieces of the lamp back to the floor. He 
      rises, getting in Kate s face and looking like he might 
      almost hit her. And she almost looks like she might like it.

                                  ARGENT
                    Get your things. I want the two of 
                    you on the road within the hour.

      Finally, Kate turns away. Argent is left watching her go 
      until his uneasy gaze falls to his hand by his side... 

      Clenched into a fist.


      Still in her formal dress, Allison sits on her bed, watching 
      her mother pack a bag for her.

                                  MRS. ARGENT

      Allison s listless stare falls on the open dresser drawer.

                    How about I pick out a few things 
                    myself?

      A PHONE RINGS. Allison and her mother both look at the 
      dresser where her CELL PHONE lies. Allison jumps up to get 
      it, but her mother grabs it first and ends the call.

                                    ALLISON

                    No. Someone named Jackson.

      Allison watches her mother pocket the phone.

                    What are you going to do to him?

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    It depends. We have a sort of moral 
                    code we follow. Especially when 
                    they re that young.

                                    ALLISON
                    But Scott didn t kill anyone. He 
                    couldn t have.

                    This is really part of a longer

                                    ALLISON
                    I want to know now. Right now.

      Mrs. Argent turns from the bag with a look that s both 
      motherly yet oddly frightening.

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    What you want right now doesn t

      Allison gives a nod, both frightened and curious.

      Stiles s Jeep skids to a halt in an otherwise quiet 
      underground parking garage. The brake lights click off, red 
      glow fading as Peter exits from the passenger side.

      Yanking Stiles out of the driver s seat, he drags him down 
      the row of cars to one in particular. Reaching into the 
      tailpipe, Peter finds a hidden set of KEYS. 

      He hits a BUTTON and pops the TRUNK.

                    It belonged to my nurse.

                    What happened to your--oh my God.

      Peter lifts up a pale and very dead female arm to get to a 
      LAPTOP BAG underneath it. He hands the bag to a slack-jawed 
      Stiles. Glancing back to the Nurse's partially covered body 
      inside, he shrugs.

                                  PETER
                    I got better.

      He slams the trunk shut.


      Under the glow of a florescent bulb, Scott sits on the floor 
      in the back of the Animal Clinic, his only refuge. Knees 
      pulled to his chest, he puts his head in his hands.

      Sounds FILTER to him, bits and pieces of the previous few

      He runs his fingers through his hair. Then interlocks them at 
      the back of his neck. Shifting from one physical display of 
      anxiety to the next.


      While Kate drives, Allison gently rests her head against the 
      passenger side window, absorbed in her own memories.

                    Because I love you.

      She closes her eyes, trying not to think about him. But when 
      she opens them--

      She sees Scott standing on the two trucks as a werewolf, 
      gazing up at her with yellow eyes.


      Squeezing his eyes shut, Scott s clenched fists rise to his 
      lips as if he s trying not to shout in frustration.

      BARKING and frantic MOVEMENT come from the dog cages in the 
      back, Scott s agitation seeming to affect them. One begins to 
      HOWL plaintively, a lonely and miserable sound.

      But it s a sound that slowly pulls Scott s head up, an idea 
      beginning to take shape.

      The BARKS of the other dogs begin to subside until all he can 
      hear is that one animal HOWLING, calling out for attention.

      Calling for a response.


      A TRUCK ROARS past Kate s car, snapping Allison s eyes open. 
      She sits up in the passenger seat to notice something.

                    Now that s a fitting choice of

      She pushes down on the pedal, driving faster and faster.


      Unzipping the laptop bag, Peter pulls out a MACBOOK PRO and 
      places it on the trunk in front of Stiles.

      Shoes pound the tile floor of the hospital. Jackson bullets

      Weak, but still very much alive, a chained Derek trembles 
      visibly when Scott's faint and distant call for help finally 
      reaches his ears.

      Struggling to lift his head, his eyes snap open to reveal the 
      faintest of a blue light around the irises. Starting to glow 
      brighter and brighter...


      Stiles stares at a GPS map on the laptop screen in confusion.

      in the distance. The faint almost imperceptible sound of 
      Scott howling.

      FADE IN:


      Worried teens looking very out of place in their formal wear 
      gather in the waiting area outside the ICU. Heads turn to 
      notice someone slowly approaching. Talking fades to whispers 
      when they each catch a glimpse of--

      Allison. 

      Slowly approaching the crowd, she notices Jackson talking to 
      several officers.

      Allison pushes through. All she can HEAR is her own 
      breathing. People talk to her but no words come out of their 
      mouths.

      She approaches the windows of the ICU and peers in. Lydia 
      lies in the hospital bed. Blood seeps through the bandages.

      Allison puts her hand to the window. As soon as her 
      fingertips touch the glass--

      SOUND RUSHES BACK. The roar of the hospital surrounds her.

                                  VOICE
                    Miss, I m sorry but you can t be 
                    here...

      Allison nods and steps back, turning away and--


      Slipping into the passenger seat, Allison shuts the door.

      Peter tosses the laptop bag into the backseat of the car. But 
      with his hand on the door, his head cocks to the side, ears 
      picking up something in the distance.

      Stiles notices the odd look on Peter and then glances about 
      as if he might actually catch the sound as well.

      But only Peter hears Derek s faint and far off return howl. 
      Shutting the door, he looks back to Stiles.

                                  PETER
                    Give me your car keys.

                    Careful, she grinds in second.

      Peter crushes the keys in his bare hand and then hands them 
      back in a tangled metallic mess. He turns for the driver s 
      side of his nurse s car.

                    That first night in the woods, I

                    pack. It could easily have been 
                    you. 

      He turns Stiles s shaking hand around so that the palm is 
      facing him.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    You d be every bit as powerful as

                    quicker, more popular. Watching him 
                    get the girl.

      He draws Stiles s hand closer to him.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    You ll be equals. Or maybe more. 
                    Maybe for once in your life, you ll

      Peter opens his mouth, exposing his fangs. He slowly guides 
      Stiles's trembling hand up and toward his teeth.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Yes. Or no?

      For a moment, Stiles stares at his open palm and truly 
      struggles with the decision. But then he pulls back, hand 
      slipping out of Peter s grasp.

                    yourself.

      Peter turns for the car and a moment later, he s pulling out 
      of the space, racing for the exit to the parking garage and 
      leaving Stiles standing there alone, watching and wondering.


      Scott feels his way through the pitch black, but he s barely 
      able to glimpse more than a few feet ahead.

      He stumbles, splashing into WATER. It drips from above as 
      well, dampening his hair.

      He continues inching forward, one hand feeling his way along 
      torn sheets of plastic covering a stone wall.


      Stiles rushes in to find the group of classmates keeping 
      vigil for Lydia. Gasping for breath from running, he slows 
      his pace. Everyone looks up at him, all clearly worried.

                    I gotta  warn you, though. I used 
                    to play in college.

      Marcus rears back and swings. But Derek CATCHES the bat with 
      his hand which is now freed from the chains. 

      As Marcus looks on with wide eyes, the basement fills with 
      sound of wood CRACKING and SNAPPING apart. 

      Pieces of the bat crumble to the floor around Marcus s feet.

      Marcus s eyes flick over to Scott who steps out of the 
      shadows. When Marcus looks back to Derek--

      A FIST comes hurtling right at his face.

      Body soaring across the room, Marcus tumbles brutally to a 
      stop on the floor.

      FADE IN:


      Stiles follows his father down the corridor, battering him 
      with questions.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Go back and stay with your friends.

                    Dad, tell me. You know it has 
                    something to do with Derek.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I thought you two barely knew him.

                          (admitting)
                    We might know him a little better 
                    than that.

                    You do realize I m elected to this 
                    job?

                                  STILES

                    you ll get re-elected, right? Dad? 
                    Come on.

      Finally, Stilinski stops.

                    That girl in there has nothing to 
                    do with a six year-old arson case.

                    When did you decide it was 
                      definitely arson?

      And Stilinski stops, realizing his mistake.

                                  STILINSKI
                    We have a key witness. And I m not 
                    telling you who. But yeah, we know 
                    it was arson. And that it was 
                    probably organized by a young

                    Probably in her late twenties now.

                                  STILINSKI
                    No, but she had this--she had a 
                    very distinctive--what do you call 
                    it?

      The RINGING seems to get LOUDER and LOUDER.

                    A what? What was it?

                      A necklace.

      And finally Stilinski puts the phone to his ear. He walks 
      away, not seeing the look on Stiles s face. A look of 
        realization.


      Derek reaches for the other restraint to free himself. The 
      bolts at his wrists, however, have to be held at both ends 
      making it impossible for him to unlock it with one hand.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1125.

      Now he s got Argent s attention.


      Allison stops short inside, glancing about in the darkness. 
      Breath held, she steps past the stairwell to find--      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1136.

      Peter holding Kate in front of him by the fireplace in the 
      charred living room. His fingers press to her throat, right 
      at her larynx.

                                  PETER
                    She s beautiful, Kate. She looks 
                    like you. Probably not as damaged. 
                    So I m going to give you a chance 
                    to save her. Apologize. Say your 
                    sorry for decimating my family. For 
                    leaving me burned and broken for 
                    six years. Say it and I ll let her 
                    live.

      Allison and Kate connect eyes.

                                  KATE
                    I m... I m sorry.

      Peter nods. Then presses his fingers tighter into Kate s 
      throat. And with the sound of tearing flesh, his CLAWS 
      PROTRACT, sticking right into Kate s neck.

      Allison SHRIEKS as Peter pulls his hand away covered in 
      blood. Kate s body falls--*

      And as she falls, IMAGES flash into her mind, given to her in *
      the same way Peter gave pieces of his life to Scott and how *
      Jackson culled bits of Derek s experiences.*

      And every image she sees is a face screaming out through *
      black smoke and fire.*

      Kate falls dead to the floor.*

                                  PETER
                    I don t know about you, Allison. 
                    But that apology? It just didn t 
                    sound very sincere.

      Claws out, he starts toward her. FABRIC TEARING under his *
      expanding body, the black coat falls away. Pants ripping at *
      the seams as the skin darkens underneath. Until finally--

      Allison stares up in horror at a seven foot CREATURE standing 
      in front of her. But the Alpha pauses when he hears A GROWL. 
      Turning, he finds--

      Scott slowly rising from the darkness, lifting his head to 
      reveal he s transformed.

      Another GROWL sends the red eyes turning to Derek who, 
      stepping into the light, is also shifted and ready to attack.    TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1136A.

      CONTINUED:4141

      The two werewolves circle the Alpha, crouching low, moving in 
      synchronicity. And for the first time, Derek and Scott seem 
      like part of the same pack.

      They launch into the air, attacking in the same instant. But 
      Peter is prepared. He sends Derek hurtling into one wall and 
      Scott into the next.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1137.

      CONTINUED:4141

      Allison falls back, debris flying, wood splintering. She 
      moves for the door, crawling outside of the house as--

      Derek and Scott both land back on their feet in an instant. 
      They attack again and again, but Peter pounds them back each 
      time until--

      Derek falls, blood spitting from his lips while Peter grabs 
      Scott by the back of his neck, pulling him up like a puppy 
      and then THROWING HIM OFF HIS FEET.


      The pitch black breaks up under the glow of FLASHLIGHT BEAMS 
      waving over the floor. Deputies hurry to catch up to one 
      person who kneels over a body--

      Stilinski. A disturbed look in his eyes, he slowly reaches 
      down to Kate s body before him and lifts something up from 
      around her chest. 

      THE NECKLACE.

      The same one she gave to Allison. The same one Harris told 
      him the arsonist would be wearing. Stilinski stares at it, 
      feeling over the symbol for the Beast of Gevaudan with his 
      thumb. Wondering...


      The door to a darkened patient room CREAKS open. Two heads 
      peer in. Stiles and Scott. They slip inside and pull into the 
      shadows as an ORDERLY PASSES by down the hall.

                                  SCOTT
                            (whispering)
                    Shut the door.

      Stiles nods and puts his hand on the door. He slowly starts 
      to push it with the gentlest touch possible. But the DOOR 
      SQUEALS, almost absurdly loud.

      Stiles pauses, glancing to Scott who cringes behind him.

      Even more gently, Stiles starts to push the door closed 
      again. It SQUEALS again. Then, even more carefully, Stiles 
      tries again. But the slower he pushes, the LOUDER the SQUEAL 
      until it s almost a SHRIEK OF METAL SCRAPING AGAINST METAL.

      With Scott practically writhing in frustration, Stiles 
      finally clicks the door closed.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1140.

                    What?

      Moving quietly in the dark room, they ease past a curtain to 
      find Lydia asleep on her side in the hospital bed. Difficult 
      breathes escape from her lips as the two boys approach.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Do it.

                                  SCOTT
                    You do it.

                                  STILES
                    I can t. I m too worried.

      With a cautious glance around the curtain, Scott slowly lifts 
      the bandage off Lydia's side to get a look at the wound. But 
      fear turns to confusion as he gets a clear look.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    What? Is it healed? Completely?

                                  SCOTT
                    No. Not at all.

      The wound is bloody and scabbed. It looks perfectly normal.

                                  STILES
                    I don t get it. The doctors said 
                    she was going to be fine.

                                  SCOTT
                    But the bite s not healing like it 
                    did with me. Which means she s not 
                      a werewolf.

                                  STILES
                    Then what the hell is she?

      Scott shakes his head as they both gaze down at Lydia, 
      sleeping fitfully, eyes moving faster and faster beneath 
      closed lids.

      Beyond them and up the stairs, the rest of the house lies 
      strangely quiet.


      Past the door, the room is dimly lit by the desk lamp. The 
      bed lies empty. But the window is open...


      The door to the Hale house clicks open. Stepping inside, a 
      nervous Jackson peers about in the darkness. When he speaks 
      it s hardly a whisper.    TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1141A.

      Silhouetted in the darkness, Derek stands motionless.

                    I... I helped. I helped save you.

      Derek doesn t reply, standing perfectly still.

                    You got what you want.

      Jackson approaches the stairs, a shaky hand reaching out to 
      the newel post.

                    Now it s my turn. Now I get what I 
                    want.

      Derek steps out of the shadows and into the light to reveal 
      something rarely seen on his face... 

      A smile. 

      But there s nothing friendly about it. His expression is pure 
      malice as his lips part to reveal lower and upper fangs 
      growing to razor sharp points. 

      With a single blink, his eyes turn a BRILLIANT RED and Derek 
      launches himself from the top of the stairs, hurtling down.

      Jackson gazes up in the terror of uncertainty, knowing he s 
      about to be bitten, but not knowing whether it s to 
        transform... 

      Or to kill.
