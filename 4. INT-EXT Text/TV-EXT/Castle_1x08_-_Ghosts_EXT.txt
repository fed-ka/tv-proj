      Beckett and Castle approach ADAM PIKE, mid-20s, as he 
      refinishes the surface of a small motorboat. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Adam? I m Detective Kate Beckett. 

      Adam, head down, continues to scrape paint off his boat.

                                  ADAM
                    This about her? Cynthia or Allison 
                    or whatever she called herself? 

                                    BECKETT
                    Did you have any idea she lived so *
                    close to you?

                                  ADAM
                    Didn t know, didn t care.

      Beckett and Castle share a look.

                                    BECKETT
                    You didn t care about the woman who 
                    almost killed your father? That s a 
                    little hard to believe.

      Adam stops now and gives them his attention.

                                  ADAM
                    You know, my family waited twenty 
                    years for the cops to find Cynthia 
                    Dern, so that my dad could get just 
                    a little bit of justice for what she 
                    did to him. Now it s too late for 
                    that, so what do you want from us?

                                    BECKETT
                    I just thought you might want to 
                    know how Cynthia died.
                          (off his silence)
                    She was drowned in motor oil.    CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Full Blue Draft     1-27-09        31.


                                  ADAM
                          (thrown)
                    Motor oil?

                                  CASTLE
                    It s almost as if the person who 
                    did it had a personal connection to 
                    the bombing.

      He doesn t answer. Looks away.*

                                    BECKETT
                    Adam, if I were to look inside your 
                    garage, would I find any motor oil?

                                  ADAM
                    I have a boat and a car, Detective. 
                    Oil kind of comes with the territory. *

                                    BECKETT
                    Where were you on Tuesday night?*

      It s late afternoon as Beckett and Castle emerge from her 
      parked car and approach a MAN in his 40s, wearing a maintenance *
      uniform, hosing down the sidewalk. Beckett badges him.*

                                    BECKETT
                    NYPD. We d like to ask you some 
                    questions about Cynthia Dern.

                                  SWANSTROM
                    I m not sure what I can tell you. I 
                    haven t seen her in twenty years.

                                  CASTLE
                    But you knew Cynthia was writing a 
                    book, right? You talked with Lee Wax.

                                  SWANSTROM
                    I talked with her, but I didn t ask 
                    a lot of questions. That part of my 
                    life is behind me now, you know? 

                                    BECKETT
                    So you weren t holding any old 
                    grudges?

                                  SWANSTROM
                    Against Cynthia? What for?

                                  CASTLE
                    For turning you in.
                          (off his look)
                    Cynthia s the one who called the 
                    cops the night you were arrested.

                                  SWANSTROM
                    If that s true, she was just trying *
                    to save herself.*
                          (off their looks)
                    After the bombing, Cynthia wanted 
                    to run, try to make it to Canada, 
                    but I wouldn t go. I fell apart.

                                  CASTLE
                    Why? 

                                  SWANSTROM
                    Guilt. I was the one who built the 
                    bomb. I m the one who messed it up. 

                                  BECKETT
                     Messed it up  how?

                                  SWANSTROM
                    I built the explosive with a timer. 
                    Once it was set, the girls were 
                    supposed to have three minutes to 
                    get off the ship before it went off. 
                    Three minutes.

                    But when Cynthia got back in the car 
                    that night, she told me something 
                    had gone wrong; that the bomb had 
                    blown early. You see? I m the reason *
                    that Susan Mailer is dead.*
