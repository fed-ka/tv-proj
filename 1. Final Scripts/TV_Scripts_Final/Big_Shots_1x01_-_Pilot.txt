      EXT. FIRMWOOD COUNTRY CLUB - DAY11

      We PUSH up the driveway, along the tennis court and swimming 
      pool, and into the barbecue, past the perfectly-manicured 
      grounds and the monied MEMBERS and GUESTS mingling on the patio 
      under a banner that reads --  ANNUAL LABOR DAY BARBECUE. 

      This is Firmwood, an exclusive country club located amongst 
      the monied estates of Westchester, New York, just north of 
      New York City, where many of our most successful CEOS -- and 
      CEOs to-be -- live, work and play.

      Amidst the snippets of dialogue --  No, the insider trading 
      charges were dropped,   She was a wonderful nanny until she 
      was deported,   I have the X3 and the X5.  One day I hope to 
      get the X7.  -- we HEAR something slightly more interesting -- 
      the SOUNDS of SEX.  And we re --

      INT. WINE CELLAR - FIRMWOOD - CONTINUOUS22

      A COUPLE is engaged in passionate love-making.  DUNCAN, early 
      40s and dapper, has LISBETH, also early 40s and classically 
      attractive -- pinned amidst the aging wine bottles.

                                    LISBETH
                    Do you think they re going to hear 
                    us?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Only if we keep doing it right...

      Another beat of lovemaking.  We re not quite sure who this 
      pair of lovers is until...

                                    LISBETH 
                    Oh...I forgot to mention -- you 
                    need to talk to Cameron.  She 
                    dropped out of school last week.

      Duncan looks at her.  Lisbeth nods.  But he stays focused on 
      the task at hand.  And Lisbeth seems to be enjoying it too.

                                    LISBETH (CONT D)
                    God.  If we did it like this when 
                    we were married, we might still be 
                    married.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Or just very, very tired.

      INT. OAK ROOM - FIRMWOOD33

      The necklace rests in the hand of WALTER STORRS, late 50s and 
      craggily handsome.  Walter is the CEO of AMERIMART 
      INDUSTRIES.  As he admires it, the door pushes open and

      JAMES WALKER, 35, enters.  James is our moral center, 
      handsome with an easy charm that makes him instantly 
      likeable.  He notes the necklace in Walter s hands.

                                  JAMES 
                          (re: the necklace)
                    Your wife is a very lucky woman, 
                    sir.

      Walter says nothing.  He simply slips the necklace back into 
      its BLACK CASE.  Then he motions for James to sit across from 
      him in one of the leather club chairs.

                                  WALTER
                    James.  Thanks for meeting me.  So 
                    tell me -- how long have you been a 
                    member of Firmwood?

                                  JAMES
                          (lightly)
                    Since my Christmas bonus. And thank 
                    you for that, by the way.

                                  WALTER
                    Well, I hope it won t be awkward.  
                    Running into each other here.

                                  JAMES
                    Why would it be awkward?  We see 
                    each other at the office every day.

                                  WALTER
                    Because I m letting you go.

      James is stunned.  Off his look...

                          (worked up)
                    And the Board?  They re okay with-- ?

                                  WALTER
                          (cutting him off)
                    The Board doesn t know yet.  No one 
                    does.  But when I present my 
                      reorganization plan to the 
                      stockholders tomorrow, they won t 
                    have any choice.

                    You ll land on your feet, James.  I 
                    know you will. You re a survivor.  
                    That s why I hired you in the first 
                    place.

      James shakes his head in disbelief.  Walter stands to leave, 
      then turns back.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Oh.  And since you re new here, 
                    make sure you try the shrimp -- 
                    it s one of life s true pleasures.

      And with that, the CEO is gone.  James remains, shell-
      shocked, his professional life flashing before his eyes.  A 
      moment ago, the shining future of AmeriMart and now...nearly 
      unemployed.  We FREEZE FRAME over him as the screen reads --

      In a secluded area of the barbecue, we FIND KARL, late 30s 
      with a sweet, round face -- as he talks in hushed tones into 
      his cell phone.  As he does, he nervously twists his WEDDING 
      BAND around his ring finger.

                          (into phone)
                    I m sorry, sweetie.  But I told 
                    you, after the barbecue I need to 
                    get right to the office.  No, it s 
                    a crisis.  Distribution mixed up 
                    our shipments of Viagra and 
                    chewable vitamins.  Boys all over 
                    the Midwest are getting spontaneous 
                      erections.

      Karl is clearly not pleased with himself. Or his lies.    UNTITLED JON FELDMAN PROJECT     3/27/07   FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT  4.



                                  KARL (CONT D)
                    So don t wait up, okay?
                          (he listens, then)
                    French toast for breakfast sounds 
                    great.
                          (beat, assuaging her)
                    Of course I love your french toast.  
                    You know I m always honest with 
                    you...

      Karl hangs up.  His face sinks, instantly drained.  Clearly, 
      the stress of his lies is getting to him.

      ON THE BUFFET LINE, as an OVERWEIGHT CLUB MEMBER piles a heap 
      of food onto his plate.  

      DOWN THE LINE, we find BRODY -- 35, cynical, handsome -- as 
      he watches the glutton and mutters to himself --

                                  BRODY
                          (under his breath)
                    Geez, hasn t he ever heard of 
                    seconds?  Hey Huge, how about this 
                    concept -- two trips.  Think of the 
                    second one as cardio.

      The Overweight Guy pads off with his food, as Brody moves 
      down the line.  But as he does, he realizes that one of the 
      trays is EMPTY.  Brody looks instantly concerned.

                    Where s the shrimp, Hector?

      HECTOR -- in his serving whites -- looks up from behind the

                          (staring at him)
                    What do you mean, you re out of the

                    Yes. But --

      Brody gets increasingly animated, although he does his best 
      to keep his voice down.  Clearly, a nerve has been touched.

                                  BRODY
                          (worked up)
                    And how are you supposed to tell 
                    them that they re out of luck 
                    because  The Human Planet  over 
                    there built the Mayan Pyramids out 
                    of shellfish.

      Hector looks knowingly at Brody.

                                  HECTOR
                    The shrimps.  They re for your 
                    wife, Mr. Brody?

                                  BRODY
                    First of all, they re shrimp.  Not 
                    shrimps, okay?  Second of all, 
                    Brody is my first name, not my 
                    last.  And third...
                          (softening)
                    ...help a brother out?

      A beat, Hector smiles.  He gets it.

                                  HECTOR
                    There may be some left in the lower 
                    kitchen.  I ll run it down to the 
                    pool at once.

      Brody smiles.  Relieved and appreciative.  Instantly, his 
      cell phone buzzes.  He answers it with a smile.

      James emerges, still reeling from the turn of events.  He s 
      met by STACEY, 35, his beautiful, sympathetic wife.

                                  STACEY
                    There you are.  The kids were 
                    looking for you.

      James smiles at her.  Simply seeing her face has a way of

                    Maybe you should remarry her.

                    That s right.  Because I m cheating

      EXT. FIRMWOOD - CONTINUOUS99

      AN OVERTURNED GOLF CART spins its wheels, as nearby a SMALL 
      CROWD huddles around a STRICKEN MAN.

      James pushes through the crowd to see that the downed man is 
        none-other-than...the CEO who just fired him.

                                  JAMES
                          (exclaims)
                    My boss!

      Meanwhile Brody, just OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE of ONLOOKERS, looks 
      down to see an EMPTY PLATE and SHRIMP strewn across the 
      putting green.

                                  BRODY
                    My shrimp!

      Brody scurries to start collecting his wife s shrimp as James 
      pushes to his boss  side, loosens his shirt and presses his 
      fingers against his neck to check for a pulse. 

      But there s nothing. The impact of the crash has rendered the 
      CEO unconscious.  James turns to Hector.

                                  JAMES

      James tears open Walter s jacket -- the black JEWELRY CASE 
      falls out of the inner breast pocket.  He pulls open his 
      shirt, pounds on his chest and begins administering CPR.  

      As the onlookers -- including Karl and Duncan -- watch, James 
      furiously tries to breath life into the CEO.  But it s no 
      use.  James once again checks for a pulse.  But...nothing.  
      The CEO is, well, dead.

      James looks up at his friends with a grave look in his eyes.  
      Then, to the Club Worker...

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    You can forget 9-1-1.  

      James exhales.  He takes off his jacket and gently lays it 
      over Walter s face.  And just then, Brody -- with his plate 
      of reclaimed shrimp -- sidles next to James.

                                  BRODY

      SECURITY CHECKPOINT.  Unsure if he s still employed, James 
      moves slowly towards the turnstile and, with a silent prayer, 
      swipes his card through the reader.  A long beat as James 
      stares at the DISPLAY on the turnstile.  And then...we re 
      CLOSE on the light as it turns...GREEN.  James exhales.  A 
      sigh of relief. He s still employed.

      Karl and his wife, WENDY -- late 30s and plainly pretty -- 
      sit across from the dour couples  therapist, DR. DARLENE 
      SEAVER-FILNER.  Filled with guilt, Karl looks like he d 
      rather be anywhere else.

                    Are you, Karl?

                    It s ironic.  When I had a career 
                    and friends, Karl wanted more of 
                    me.  So I quit my job and stayed 
                    home and now he complains that I

                    you find the time to take her to

                    Probably bad etiquette to gossip at

                    things hard.  I mean, when our

      another man s too.  

      Katie studies the pain in James  face, as if trying to 
      understand it.  But she doesn t and he doesn t bother to

                    I was eight and died from a stroke 
                    last year.  You re biology, Duncan.

                    What s this about?

                                  JAMES
                            (continuing)
                    You walked in -- I was already 
                    there, of course, because I arrived 
                      everywhere 15 minutes early freshman 
                    year -- and I thought to myself that 
                    if I could sit across from that girl 
                    and have a cup of coffee...that my 
                    life would be perfect.

                                  STACEY
                    You got more than a cup of coffee.

                                  JAMES
                    I know.  But my life isn t perfect.

      Stacey looks at him unsurely.

                                  STACEY
                    What s wrong?  Are you nervous 
                    about your interview tomorrow?

                                  JAMES
                    No, I was just thinking about 
                    seeing you that first time.  And 
                    wondering if my boss felt the same 
                    way.  The first time he saw you.

      Stacey stares at him.  But does her best to betray nothing.

                                  JAMES
                    You...you were sleeping with him.  
                    That necklace you had yesterday. He 
                    gave it to you before he died,

                    But I do love you...

                                  JAMES
                    Answer me.  Were you having an 
                    affair with him?  And I ll respect 
                    you a helluva lot more if you tell 
                    me the truth.

                    Yes.

      James nods.  His worst fears confirmed.

                                  JAMES
                    No, I am. Because I don t respect 
                    you one bit.

      James walks past her.  As he does, she clutches at his arm.  
      But he pulls away.

                                  STACEY
                    Wait.  Where are you going?  Jamey?  
                    Let s talk about this.  James... 
                    don t walk out on me.

      He stops, stares at her.

                                  JAMES
                    I may be leaving.  But I m not the 
                    one who walked out.

      James walks past her and down the driveway.  As the tears run 
      down her face...

                    James.  Wait.  James!

      We HEAR his car start and peel off.  He s gone.  As James 
      disappears into the night, we...SMASH TO BLACK.

      INT. JAMES  OFFICE - NEXT DAY3434

      James sits at his desk.  Looking every bit the man whose 
      whole world has been turned upside down. Barely slept.  
      Unshaven, no tie.  Although a few tie options rest on his 
      desk.  After a beat, his cell phone rings.  He looks at the 
      display which reads  STACEY CALLING.   He presses a button 
      and redirects it to voice mail.

      Just then, Katie enters.  Stylish and confident in her sleek 
      Prada suit.  She takes him in.

                                  KATIE
                    Look at you.  I can t believe I 
                    need to tell you this, but today s 
                    the wrong day not to bring your  A-
                    game. 

                                  JAMES 
                    How do you know that my  A-game  
                    doesn t include making you think 
                    I m not bringing my  A-game? 

      Katie considers this.  

                                  KATIE
                    By the way, why d you run out of 
                    the wake like that?  You didn t 
                    even say goodbye.

                                  JAMES
                          (covering)
                    Stomach thing, sorry.

      Just then, James  assistant pokes her head in.

                    Ms. Graham, the Board is ready for

                                  KATIE
                    I ll be right in.
                          (a beat, turns to James)
                    You know I love you, but I want 
                    this job.  And except for men, I m 
                    pretty good at getting what I want.

      James nods.  Then Katie takes him in -- in all his pitiful 
      glory.  She can t help herself...

                                  KATIE (CONT D)

      Katie straightens James  collar.  Smooths his hair.

                    And wear the blue tie.  It looks 
                    great on you.

      And she s gone.  James smiles to himself.  Then as he looks 
      back at the picture, the smile runs from his face.

      INT. CLUB - HALLWAY - DAY3535

      After an early morning round of golf, Karl pulls Brody into a 
      secluded corner of the club...

                                  KARL
                    I need to end it.  With Marla.  I 
                    mean, we have nothing in common. 
                    The only books she reads are about 
                    the differences between good carbs 
                    and bad.

                                  BRODY
                    So end it. What s the problem?

      Karl reaches into his pocket and takes out a PAIR of the 
      SLINKIEST, SEXIEST PANTIES that we ve ever seen.  He HOLDS 
      them up for Brody to see.

                                  KARL 
                    How do you break up with a woman 
                    who wears underwear like this?

      Brody stares at the panties, then pats Karl on the back.

                                  BRODY
                    With great regret.

      Duncan admires the ball that he s just hit off the roof of 
      his office building. He tees up another as he addresses his 
      UPPER-LEVEL MANAGEMENT that stands around him.

                                  DUNCAN

      Duncan smacks another ball off the tee and into the distance.

                    Sir...um, aren t you worried about 
                    hurting someone?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Nonsense.  Adam has it taken care 
                    of.

      SMASH TO:  ANOTHER ROOF TOP.3737

      ADAM, 25 -- Duncan s assistant -- is frantically moving about 
      the roof to nab the incoming golf balls with a catcher s mitt.

3838BACK TO THE MAIN ROOF -- 

      Duncan sets down his driver and continues to address his 
      execs.  As he does, Cameron quietly enters with a TRAY OF TO-
      GO COFFEES.  She hands the execs their espressos and 
      macchiatos as Duncan continues to speak.

                                  DUNCAN 
                    ...but even in success, Reveal must 
                    be a leader, not a follower.  Did 
                    you know that by the year 2015, the 
                    most rapidly expanding population 
                    group will be women over sixty?   
                    Why not make these women feel 
                    beautiful too? 

      The execs nod and murmur  yes  as Duncan continues.

                    homes not have access to the best

      All eyes turn to Cameron.  Duncan boils.

                                  DUNCAN
                    That s not the point.  Do you know 
                    what a 19-year old girl would do

                    Just one thing -- maybe you don t 
                    think I look like a CEO.  Or sound 
                    like one.  But this company s in 
                    trouble.  Walter Storrs knew it

      INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY4242

      Karl lies in bed.  Post-coital.  Marla -- in a skirt and bra -
      - takes herself in in the full-length mirror.

                                  MARLA
                    I wished I hadn t eaten all that 
                    bread at lunch.  Nothing worse than 
                    bad carbs. 

      Karl exhales.  He can t listen to these inanities anymore. 

                                  KARL
                          (haltingly)
                    Marla... if I may... we ve had 
                    quite an adventure, you and I.  But 
                    like every great adventure... there 
                    comes a time when --

      Marla isn t really listening, as she opens her pocketbook.

                                  MARLA 
                    Damn.  I forgot to go to the cash 
                    machine.  Can you loan me twenty 
                    dollars for a cab?

                          (beat, continuing)
                    Like I was saying.  Everything has 
                    it s time and place, but --

      Marla picks up Karl s pants, takes out his wallet.  But 
      instead of cash, she pulls out two TICKET STUBS.  We re CLOSE 
      on the tickets which read,  The Nanny Diaries.   Marla 
      furrows her brow.

                                  MARLA 
                          (unsure, re: the tickets)

                    Last night.  Wendy was dying to see it.  

      Marla stops short.  She thinks, then...

                                  MARLA
                    But you said -- hmmm, you said you

                    We don t. The couple s therapist 
                    thought it would be a good idea.  
                    But getting back to what I was --

      Marla exhales.  Scorned, she s instantly on the war-path.

                                  MARLA 
                    Well, don t I feel like a fool? I 
                    mean, you had me convinced that you 
                    and your wife were practically 
                    strangers and --

                                  KARL
                    We are...

                                  MARLA
                    Well, I don t go to the movies with 
                      strangers, Karl.  Do you?
                          (beat, angry)
                    I mean, what kind of man would be 
                    so deceitful as to lie to the woman 
                    he s cheating on his wife with?

      Karl looks like his head might explode.

                                  MARLA (CONT D)
                    You know, I bet Wendy would like to 
                    know what her loving husband is up 
                    to when he s not at home.

                    What are you saying?  You re gonna

                                  MARLA
                    Not everything.  Just the part 
                    about the sex in the hotel rooms.

      Marla exits. Karl wraps a sheet around himself and scurries 
      to the door. A CHAMBERMAID looks at him askance.

      INT. STEAM ROOM - FIRMWOOD - LATER4343

      Karl, Brody, Duncan and a contemplative James are wrapped in 
      towels in the steam room.  Karl clearly has just finished 
      recounting Marla s threat.

                                  DUNCAN
                    C mon, Karl.  The mistress never 
                    tells.  Just buy her something 
                    nice.  Like some jewelry.  Or a low-

                    I was inches from ending it.  And -- 
                    now...  I mean, maybe Wendy and I 
                    have grown apart lately, but the

                    you ve lost her already.

                                  JAMES
                    How do you know she s not spending 
                    her afternoons in some hotel room,

                    But Wendy hates our contractor.  He 
                    was completely unreliable...

      Brody, Duncan and Karl share a look over James  
        uncharacteristic behavior.  Duncan turns to James.

                    Okay.  All this genuine emotion is 
                    making me a little uneasy.

                    I can t believe you, Karl.  All I 
                    can say is -- I m shocked.

      Karl s heart is immediately in his throat.

                    Right.  Well, about that --

                    Why didn t you tell me you hired a 
                      decorator?  Marla and I were just 
                      discussing ideas for the guest 
                    house.

      Karl can only force a weak smile.  Apparently, Marla hasn t 
      yet revealed the affair.

                    It s so unlike Karl to take an

      INT. BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT4747

      Lisbeth, looking beautiful, sits alone at a table, awaiting 
      her date.  A soft figure passes behind her - her date? -- and 
      then slides into the empty seat across from her. It s Duncan.

                                    LISBETH
                          (not thrilled)
                    Duncan.  What are you doing here? 
                    My date s going to be here any 
                    minute.

                    I need to talk to you about 
                    Cameron.  She s belligerent.  And 
                      headstrong.  You can t tell her a 
                    thing she already doesn t know...

                                    LISBETH
                    You should be happy. Proof that 
                    she s yours.

      Duncan flags a passing WAITRESS.

      Duncan turns back to Lisbeth.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Well I don t just know if it s 
                    gonna work out.  With Cam.

                                    LISBETH 
                    She ll be disappointed.  But it 
                    won t be the first time.

                                  DUNCAN
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                    LISBETH
                    She s angry at you, Duncan.  Not that 
                    she can admit it.  But she is...

                                  DUNCAN
                     Angry?  I ve given her everything 
                    she s ever asked for.    UNTITLED JON FELDMAN PROJECT     3/27/07   FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT  45.


                                    LISBETH
                    That s true.  But did you ever 
                    notice, that after she turned 
                    twelve she stopped asking?

      Clearly, this lands on Duncan.  He s instantly lost in 
      thought.  Lisbeth looks up at him with sympathy.

                                    LISBETH (CONT D)
                    Look.  You may not have been the 
                    greatest father to date.  But 
                    you re a good man.  And the best 
                    thing about being a father   every 
                    day s a chance to do better.

      Duncan nods, softens.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Were you this pretty when we were 
                    married?

                                    LISBETH
                    Prettier.  You never stopped long 
                    enough to notice.

      A moment of connection.  Then Duncan smiles...

                                  DUNCAN
                    Your date.  So you like this guy?

                                    LISBETH
                    I might.

                                  DUNCAN
                    If it gets serious...no more wine 
                    cellars for us, right?

                                    LISBETH
                    That s right, Duncan.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Call me after, okay?  So I don t 
                    have to obsess.

                    Good night, Duncan.

      Duncan stands, grabs his drink off the tray of the arriving 
      waitress and starts to exit.  As he does, he passes a MAN IN 
      A SUIT -- Lisbeth s date -- entering.  Duncan sizes him up as

      INT. KARL S HOUSE - LATER4848

      ANGLE on Wendy -- down the hall in the kitchen -- as she 
      mixes Karl his nightly seven-and-seven.

      REVERSE onto Karl and Marla, in the living room.  He speaks 
      in hushed, urgent tones.  Occasional glances back at Wendy.

                    Then what are you doing here?

                    Well, I came here to tell her.  But 
                    then I realized -- Wendy s not the 
                    one I want to hurt.  And then we 
                    got to talking and you know what?

                    Karl.  How you could not appreciate 
                    her is beyond me.  She s a gem.  I 
                    have half a mind to fix her up with

      stare at the picture. There s also evidence that he s been

                    I never liked her, you know.  Even

                    Of course, if you take her back, 
                    I ll deny ever saying that.

                      Unbelievable. My wife finally makes 
                    a friend and it s my mistress.  
                    What are the odds?

                                  DUNCAN
                          (on the bright side...)
                    Well, at least you ll have something 
                    to talk about in couple s therapy.

      Just then, Duncan s face turns ashen as he looks to the 
      ENTRANCE of the room to see --

      Dontrelle, standing in the doorway.  Duncan nearly chokes on 
      his drink.

                    ...H. Christ.

      Duncan -- hoping to prevent a scene -- moves quickly towards 
      Dontrelle and Cameron, who smiles at him.

                                    CAMERON
                    Duncan, there s someone who I think 
                    you d like to speak with...

      INT. PARTY - CONTINUOUS5252

      A WOMAN -- we can t see her face -- gives Brody a hug and 
      disappears into the crowd.  This is JANELLE, Brody s wife.  
      Brody smiles to himself, self-satisfied, as James steps in 
      next to him.

                                  BRODY
                    Janelle s thrilled.  She s having a 
                    great time.

                                  JAMES
                    That makes you happy, doesn t it?

      Brody uncharacteristically softens.

                                  BRODY
                    I know I bitch about her.  But 
                    she s got another side, too.  Maybe 
                    you don t see it.  Maybe I don t 
                    see it as much as I used to.  But 
                    we just fit, you know?

      James nods. He might have once said the same thing about 
      himself and Stacey.

                                  JAMES
                          (with regret)
                    Yeah.  I know.

      Then, James does his best to pull himself out of his reverie 
      and indicates the dessert table filled with Napoleons.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    And I see the Napoleons made it...

                                  BRODY
                    No, they re still in Tampa.  But I 
                    found this little place in Jersey 
                    that knocked  em out in two hours.  
                    Janelle never knew the difference.

                                  DUNCAN
                    So remember...if that reporter asks 
                    any questions, you never met me.

                                  DONTRELLE
                    For a grand, I can forget almost 
                    anything.

      The pair exits the wine cellar.

      EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS5454

      OUTSIDE THE WINE CELLAR -- James, Brody and Karl stare unsurely 
      as Duncan emerges from the wine cellar with Dontrelle.

                                  DUNCAN 
                          (to the guys)
                    Oh.  Guys...this is Dontrelle.  
                      Dontrelle...the guys.

                                  DONTRELLE
                          (smiles, to Duncan)
                    They re very cute.

                                  DUNCAN
                    They know you re packing.

                                  DONTRELLE
                          (shrugs)
                    Worth a shot.

      Dontrelle moves down the hall.  Duncan gives the guys a look, 
      then moves down the hall after her.  As they clear frame, 
      they REVEAL --

      STACEY, standing at the end of the hall.

      As a TAXI pulls away with Dontrelle inside, Duncan breathes a 
      sigh of relief.  Just then, Cameron steps in next to him.

                    You and Dontrelle -- not just old

      Cameron nods.  A beat, then...

                                    CAMERON
                    You know, we re more alike than I 
                    thought, Duncan.  We both have 
                    trouble getting out of our own 
                    ways.

      Duncan turns and looks at her.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Are you going to stop embarrassing 
                    me at work?

                                    CAMERON
                    Probably not.  
                          (then)
                    Are you going to stop judging me?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Not likely.

                                    CAMERON
                    Well at least we know where we 
                    stand.

      Cameron turns and starts to walk off...

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    Good night, Duncan.  See you

                          (calling after her)
                    You can call me  Dad,  you know.

                                    CAMERON
                    I know.  
                          (then)
                    Good night, Duncan.

      Duncan watches Cameron walk off.  He can t help but smile.  
      He might actually be making progress with his daughter.

                    Dontrelle tonight than I do my own 
                    wife.
                          (as the guys laugh, 
                            deadpan)
                    What part of that do you think 
                    wasn t serious?

      More laughter.  And as we RISE above Firmwood, we... FADE TO 
      BLACK.
