A bottle of expensive, Laphroaig scotch sits on the table.
Charlie pours them each a shot. Jacobs drinks. It feels good.
JACOB
(to the Scotch)
Ah, I remember you...Camel would've
loved this stuff.
CHARLIE
Camels drink scotch?
Jacob laughs, shaking his head No. Charlie pours another;
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
You really got here on you're own?
JACOB
The Great Escape! But I got lost.
CHARLIE
I should call the home, let them
know where you are.
JACOB
I don't know why they call it a
"home". You don't know anybody
there. They fill you so full of
drugs, you don't care...Five kids
and not one has a place for me
since their mother died. They take
turns visiting me on weekends. They
forgot whose turn it was today so
nobody showed up..
(BEAT)
I had a life, ya know. A big
life...It isn't right.
Charlie empathizes. Pours another. Changes the subject.
CHARLIE
So, how did the Benzini Brothers
stampede start? The story is two
guys got thrown off the train and--
JACOB
No point in telling a story if all
you want to know is the end.
CHARLIE
Sorry. From the beginning.
5.
JACOB
Now, let's see...the beginning...
Well, everything began the same day
everything ended...Ha, isn't that
how it always works?...
A mirrored medicine cabinet closes revealing the reflection
of JACOB JANKOWSKI - 23 years old, handsome, full of energy.
JACOB (V.O.)
It was a big day. My final exams.
Jacob bounds down the stairs and into the kitchen.
JACOB'S MOTHER AND FATHER are finishing up breakfast. The
Father tunes a Philco Radio while smoking a pipe...The Mother
pours coffee wearing a cardigan sweater and pearls.
Late for class, Jacob grabs a piece of bread and bacon and
downs a coffee as his mother sweetly scolds him in POLISH...
His father says something supportive in POLISH as well. Jacob
thanks him in POLISH. He kisses his mother and exits.
Jacob sits beside a beautiful Blonde who distracts him with
her legs. She notices him staring, crosses her legs and
smooths her skirt.
VETERINARY SCIENCES FINAL EXAMS is written on the board of a
Lecture Hall. The Proctor announces from his desk.
THE PROCTOR
You may begin.
Jacob, the Blonde and fifty other students open their exam
booklets and begin under The PROCTOR's supervision.
JACOB (V.O.)
I had my whole life planned. I knew
exactly where it was taking me...
And then, with the opening of a
door, it all vanished.
The Lecture Hall door opens and DEAN WILKINS enters. The Dean
walks to the Proctor and they confer privately. Then:
THE PROCTOR
Mr. Jankowski? May we have a word?
Fifty pairs of eyes turn to look at Jacob, who looks up.
Jacob walks down a dimly lit hall with a Police Chief and a
Chaplain to the Morgue led by a Nurse. We follow them inside.
The room is windowless and bare except for TWO GURNEYS, each
with a sheet-covered body. A CORONER stands between them.
Jacob sees a steel table upon which lay his parents
belongings; wedding rings, pearl necklace, his father's pipe.
7.
CORONER
Are you ready?
The Chaplain places a comforting hand on Jacob's shoulder.
Jacob nods. The Coroner exposes first Jacob's father, then
Jacob's mother. We see only Jacob's expression:
CHAPLAIN
Is there any other family to call?
JACOB
No. Just me.
Jacob, in a black suit. Mr. Hyde is seated opposite him.
HYDE
I know this is difficult for you,
but there's been no mistake. The
house and all their assets,
including your father's practise,
are now property of the bank in
default of the mortgage.
JACOB
But I'm telling you, my father put
away every penny he ever earned.
They owned that house outright. Why
would he have a mortgage?
HYDE
My guess is because he let people
pay him in beans & eggs or whatever
they had, instead of money.
JACOB
And so he's penalized for not
turning away people who couldn't
afford his help? He was a doctor.
HYDE
Yes, I know, he was a very good man
but in banking terms, in the
reality of what makes this world
actually function, he was an
irresponsible man. I'm sorry, but
you oughta to know the truth. This
Depression is going to last for a
long while..
(MORE)
8.
HYDE (CONT'D)
..And the only ones who will be
standing at the end of it, are the
ones who fight to take what they
need to survive. Everyone else is
going to disappear. Don't make the
same mistakes as your father.
Jacob is disturbed by this description of his father.
A dim light barely illuminates the interior. Jacob breaths a
brief sigh of relief and accomplishment when suddenly: A HUGE
HAND CONNECTED TO A EVEN LARGER ARM COMES OUT OF THE
DARKNESS, GRABBING JACOB BY HIS COLLAR, HOISTING HIM UP.
Jacob swings at this Brute with his free arm but it's blocked
easily, as the Brute moves him to the open car door.
OLD TIMER (O.S.)
Oh, don't go messin with Blackie.
Throwing people off of trains is
one of the perks of his job.
Jacob can now see THREE MEN playing cards by a kerosene lamp.
ONE MAN HAS A RIFLE, aimed at Jacob. Another, A SHRUNKEN,
STUBBLE FACED OLD TIMER, drinks out of a jug...
Blackie holds Jacob out on the edge of the open stock car, as
trees slam against the train almost cutting Jacob's face.
11.
BLACKIE
We don't need no bums on this train
brother. You can get off right now
and keep running.
Old Timer rises with a lantern and hobbles on one bad leg,
inspects Jacob and his nice suit with the lantern...
OLD TIMER
Now everybody calm down here. Grady
put that damn rifle away. BLACKIE
LET'IM GO...And I mean on the
inside of the train!
Jacob struggles as Blackie pins one arm behind him.
OLD TIMER (CONT'D)
I'm tellin ya, ya can't red light
him, we don't need that trouble.
Look at them clothes - he's no bum.
Blackie scans Jacob's clothes, then tosses him inside the
train and returns to the card game. Jacob pants, relieved.
OLD TIMER (CONT'D)
Don't be sore kid. It's more like a
reflex with Blackie. I'm Camel..And
that there's Grady. And Bill.
JACOB
Jacob. Jankowski. Nice to meet you.
CAMEL
You're pretty young for the rails.
You running from something boy? You
on the lam?
JACOB
No. Nothing like that.
CAMEL
Where you headed?
JACOB
I don't know.
CAMEL
Hungry? Outta work?
(JACOB NODS)
No shame in it. What can you do?
JACOB
About anything I guess.
12.
Camel gives him the once-over look then offers the jug.
CAMEL
We land in Deposit in the morning.
We'll find you some work. And if
you're still alive by the end of
it, I'll get you some food and take
you to Uncle August.
Jacob drinks and chokes on the liquor.
JACOB
Who's that?
GRADY
August Rosenbluth...Lord and Master
of the Known and Unknown Universes.
Ringmaster Extraordinaire.
Jacob looks baffled. Camel laughs as he drinks more;
CAMEL
Oh kid, don't tell me you didn't
notice?
Grady and Bill laugh though Blackie remains un-amused.
BILL
Ha, he really don't know.
CAMEL
HA! You didn't just jump a train
boy. You jumped the Flying Squadron
of the Benzini Brothers Most
Spectacular Show on Earth...
You done landed your ass on a
circus, kid!
PRE-LAP: The Circus Train brakes screeching to a halt!
Jacob is rolled awake as the train stops. He is disoriented
as Blackie, Grady and Bill jump out through the open stock
car door. Camel is fast asleep, drunk from the jug.
Jacob enters. A stillness takes the place of the chaos
outside: The translucent tent is as tall as the sky. It has
barely been set up - just the tent and:
THE ANIMALS.
Jacob is in awe. Camels, llamas, zebras and horses stand
behind low ropes slung between iron stakes, some with their
heads in mounds of hay.....Two giraffes stand within a chain-
link fence....lions, tigers, panthers, jaguars, bears, chimps
and an Orangutan.
The animals stop moving, as if to give Jacob an
acknowledgement. Jacob responds with a nod or a smile.
The Orangutan is stretching it's arm outside it's den for
something out of reach. Jacob tries to understand.
JACOB
What is it? What do you want?
The Orangutan strains its arm. Blinking at him. Pointing.
Jacob looks around and sees A HALF SQUASHED ORANGE on the
ground in front of the cage. He picks it up.
Jacob opens the den and hands the Orangutan the orange. She
takes it and sets it on the floor of her den. She returns and
reaches out for Jacob again.
14.
Jacob hesitates, not knowing what she wants. But deciding to
trust her, Jacob extends his hand to hers.
The Orangutan wraps her long fingers around Jacob's hand and
holds it for a beat, looking to his face. Jacob returns the
gaze, realizing she is thanking him. He is touched.
JACOB (CONT'D)
You're welcome, ma'am.
The Orangutan lets go and returns to the orange in her den.
CAMEL (O.S.)
What the hell you doing in here?
Get outta there!! You ain't a
menagerie man. Only menagerie men
is allowed in there.
Jacob runs out to Camel.
Jacob and another Young Man, WADE, with their shirts off, are
shovelling tons of horse manure. Jacob is queasy, blinking
from the stench. The Young Man doesn't seem bothered.
JACOB
I've never seen so much manure!
WADE
Baggage stock horses. They pack'em
in 27 a car.
JACOB
How do you stand the smell?
WADE
What smell?
Jacob struggles to shovel LLAMA manure out of the menagerie.
He checks his hands - they are blistered and bleeding.
Jacob enters and is paralyzed by what he sees:
Camera angles behind BARBARA - a topless woman on stage alone
in front of rows of ogling men - as she maneuvers her breasts
in circles flipping the tassels attached to them...The men
hoot and holler for more as Barbara smiles encouragingly,
hiding her routine boredom.
Jacob is paralyzed by the sight of a naked woman.
Grady frantically motions for Jacob to snap out of it and use
the pipe at the heads sneaking under the tent to peek in...
Startled out of his enthrallment, Jacob lifts the pipe too
quickly and hits his own forehead. OW!..then proceeds to do
his job, banging the heads thru the flaps.
Jacob shovels ZEBRA manure, no longer affected by the scent.
By this point, the menagerie tent has been fully installed:
Ten chandeliers hang and twinkle from the roof illuminating
the a gloriously bannered candy stand in the tent's center.
Jacob hears someone entering the menagerie. He turns to see;
17.
Behind the rows of beautiful black and white horses, Jacob
catches flashes of pink sequins...pink tights...pink sequined
gloves of a WOMAN caressing and whispering to them.
She is MARLENA. Her shimmering eyes and hair. Her porcelain
skin. Her pink sequins make her glisten and sparkle...
Jacob is spellbound as he watches Marlena's gift with horses;
Marlena uses signals with her whip or clicking sounds with
her tongue to communicate with the horses: they line up at
her subtle command, they raise their hooves, they bow down to
her, rise up on their hind legs...
She clicks her tongue and one White Silver Maned Horse lifts
a hoof for her to inspect. She clicks for him to take a step.
Jacob notices the Silver Maned Horse walks tenderly on the
foot. He decides to help....Approaching the shimmering
Marlena, Jacob looks like he's been shovelling shit all day.
JACOB
Excuse me, ma'am? Hi. I'm Jacob.
Marlena doesn't respond. She looks at him with suspicion.
JACOB (CONT'D)
May I? He may be foundering.
Marlena nods. Jacob also clicks his tongue as he glides his
hands up Silver Star's fetlock. To Marlena's surprise, the
horse trusts Jacob, lifting its hoof. Jacob examines it.
JACOB (CONT'D)
He should be all right for tonight.
But I'd put him on stall rest as
soon as possible.
He clicks his tongue and eases the hoof down. Marlena looks
both impressed and insulted. Jacob smiles. Marlena does not.
She clicks and assembles her horses in formation, then leads
them out of the menagerie....Jacob looks after her adoringly.
WE PRE-LAP:
UNCLE AUGUST (V.O.)
LAAADIIIEEESS AND GENTLEMENNNNN!
AND CHILDREN OF ALL AGES.
Camera follows Jacob into the Big Top ...
18.
UNCLE AUGUST
WELCOME TO THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT
EXTRAVAGANCY THE HUMAN EYE CAN
BEHOLD...WELCOME THE STARS OF THE
BENZINI BROTHERS MOST SPECTACULAR
SHOW ON EARTH!!!
Jacob arrives as we reveal:
THE EXTRAORDINARY GRANDEUR OF THE SPEC - EVERY ACT, EVERY
ANIMAL - IN FULL REGALIA, PARADE FOR THE AUDIENCE AS THE BAND
PLAYS. IN THE CENTER RING IS:
Jacob can barely contain himself...The Audience - young and
old - is captivated. Faces of poor Depression era townspeople
light up with joy and amazement;
During Jacob's lines we see; Clowns, jugglers, acrobats,
exotic animals, Marlena with her Horses, high divers on fire
diving into a tank of water...it is truly spectacular:
JACOB (V.O.)
You never saw anything like it. You
could hardly take it all in without
fearing you might go blind from the
shine. From one kind of world too
hard to bear came some kind a
heaven no one knew existed.
End on Jacob seeing: Marlena gloriously atop her horses who
form a tableau, as a curtain of sparks falls behind them.
As the train travels, a worn out Jacob sits cramped under a
bunk beside A CONTORTIONIST taking up little space. Jacob
voraciously eats a plate of food Camel snuck in for him.
CAMEL
You like the food? You deserve it.
You done good, I hear..
(MORE)
19.
CAMEL (CONT'D)
(JACOB CHOKES)
..Woah, you better take a breath
before it all comes back up on ya.
Here. Have a hit of Jake.
He offers Jacob his "Jake". Jacob drinks and chokes.
CAMEL (CONT'D)
It's an acquired taste. Now get
yourself outta there. I'm gonna
take you in to see August.
As Jacob squeezes out, the Contortionist unwinds himself and
takes up more space.
JACOB
But it's the middle of the night.
CAMEL
Only time circus people live - when
they don't have to work. Come on...
Camel leads Jacob through various sleeping cars, revealing
the lowly conditions of life on the road...wooden bunks, no
private space, one bathroom for a dozen to share.
THROUGHOUT THIS NARRATION WE JUMP CUT INTO VARIOUS CARS:
- The Musicians Car: Men smoking, cleaning
instruments...looking at Jacob with suspicion and wry humor.
The Trumpet Player plays TAPS. Jacob doesn't understand why.
CAMEL
I got a son about your age. Lives
outside of Reading, PA. Haven't
seen him for years. Fix your shirt
there.
Jacob shoves in his shirt. Camel smiles. He likes the kid.
- The Clown Car: Clowns without make-up reading or playing
cards. They look at Jacob as if he were walking the last
mile. One Clown waves goodbye.
CAMEL (CONT'D)
Remember, when you meet August let
him do the talking and don't ever
mention Ringling. He hates them
bastards worse than the Depression.
20.
- Barbara and the Coochie Girls Car; Girls in various forms
of undress, negligees, sheer robes. Barbara exits a bathroom
and bumps into Jacob, who fumbles seeing her half-nude;
BARBARA
How's your pipe, kid?
Camel leads the slack-jawed Jacob away.
CAMEL
Night ladies.
BARBARA AND GIRLS
Night Camel.
Slightly more upscale and private quarters with a passenger
aisle outside individual doors and windows.
JACOB
Hey Camel - who's that woman who
works the horses?
CAMEL
(STOPS)
Now stop right there. That's
Marlena. She don't talk to nobody
and you don't talk to her. And
don't mention her to August. Ain't
no right way to talk about
somebody's wife and make it sound
like a compliment.
JACOB
Wife?
Camel takes this opportunity to drink some Jake and ask:
CAMEL
Look, kid, before we do this, I
gotta ask... ..I ain't tryin to
know your business but I do know
you ain't been on the road too
long. You're too clean, your
clothes too nice and you don't got
a possession on you. See, a man on
the road collects little things.
It's not a big life I can tell ya.
So before you start, I ask: if you
got any kind of life to go back to,
that's what you should do.
21.
Jacob stops. He tries to not sound emotional when he says:
JACOB
I don't.
Camel studies him, as if understanding what isn't said.
CAMEL
I am sorry to hear that.
They move on.
Jacob falls into Uncle August's opulent private car, with
wood panelling, cushioned furniture and chandeliers.
Sitting at a table playing cards are CECIL the Barker,
DIAMOND JOE (menagerie and ring stock), MR. ERWIN (talent
booker), CRAZY JOE (baggage stock) and, with his back to us
in a high wing back chair, (UNCLE) AUGUST ROSENBLUTH.
22.
Earl shoves him against the wall, dangling him off the floor.
As August speaks to Jacob, all we see is the back of his head
and smoke from his cigar as he plays cards throughout...
AUGUST
What's this?
EARL
That stowaway the old drunk took
under his wing. College boy.
Jacob tries to explain but Earl bangs him against the wall.
AUGUST
(to the game)
I'll see your three and raise you
five...
(TO JACOB)
I don't believe I've had the
pleasure.
JACOB
Jacob Jankowski, sir.
AUGUST
And what is a "Jacob Jankowski" and
why he is on my train?
JACOB
Just looking for work, sir.
MR. ERWIN
Can you fly? Set yourself on fire?
JACOB
No sir.
AUGUST
Ever worked a show, son?
JACOB
No sir.
AUGUST
Ever been to a show?
JACOB
Yes sir...
Jacob, sensing where this is going, gets August's attention;
23.
JACOB (CONT'D)
Ringling Brothers.
August stops playing cards. The others react with sudden
apprehension. Earl casually shakes his head to warn Jacob.
August finally rises and turns to Camera: handsome,
charismatic, fiercely intelligent...matinee idol looks that
mask a darker nature.
AUGUST
Ringling, you say?
JACOB
Yes. But it was terrible.
AUGUST
Really? Have you seen our show?
(JACOB NODS)
What was your favorite act?
Jacob sees a CIRCUS POSTER with Marlena and her Horses.
JACOB
The uh...the one with the black and
white horses. And the girl in pink.
AUGUST
Ah, our Star Attraction. Well, I
believe we're looking for a boy to
carry water for the elephants,
aren't we Diamond Joe?
DIAMOND JOE
We don't have an eleph-
AUGUST
Shut-up.
JACOB
I would do that, sir. I'd like to
work with the animals.
August and the others chuckle. Jacob doesn't understand why.
August crosses to Jacob, as he ridicules:
AUGUST
And you'd carry water for
elephants? Ha, ha...you have any
idea how much water an elephant
drinks, kid? College! Pfft! Never
met a college man yet who knew his
own ass from shinola.
(MORE)
24.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
(MORE SINISTER)
You eat my food and you ride my
train like you're entitled to
survive. But you see, nothing
survives here without my
permission...Maybe if you tell me
you're nothing, I'll let you stay,
although my bet is you won't last.
Jacob refuses to let August demean him. He stays silent.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
You smell like every kind of shit.
Why would a college boy want that?
JACOB
Times are hard for everybody...And
I guess because ... out of all the
dirt and sweat and shit and working
with fellas you don't want to be
caught dead meeting in the
daylight, comes...so much beauty.
We think August and the men are moved by Jacob's words.
AUGUST
That's beautifully put.
(THEN:)
Toss him off, Earl. And make sure
you see the red light before you
red light him.
As Earl drags Jacob in tow, August derides him to the others;
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Another sonny boy mad at mommy and
daddy for paying the bills. Sounds
like he studied poetry.
CRAZY JOE
I got no use for people who rhyme.
JACOB
(shouts as he is dragged)
It was veterinary science! And I
can tell you one thing - that Star
Attraction horse of yours won't be
walking in a few days let alone
performing center ring!!
August stops and turns.
AUGUST
Earl wait!
25.
Earl stops with Jacob. Now all the men are intrigued...
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Veterinary science?
(Earl stops with Jacob)
May I ask what school?
JACOB
Cornell.
AUGUST
(IMPRESSED)
You're a Cornell graduate?
Jacob lies and nods...August wonders whether to trust Jacob.
DIAMOND JOE
Marlena did want a vet to take a
look at Silver Star. They cost.
CECIL
He worked the rubes for me this
afternoon. Pretty good.
CRAZY JOE
He shovelled horse shit. Don't make
him a horse doctor.
August looks reluctant. Until Jacob caps it:
JACOB
I hear Ringling has its own vet.
The other men can't believe Jacob spoke up like this. But it
amuses August, who faces him and smiles;
AUGUST
All right, Cornell. Come with me.
August leads Jacob out.
August drops into the Ring Stock Car followed by Jacob. On
one side is a line of Marlena's Black and White Show Horses.
The other side, there is a makeshift door.
August kicks through the door, revealing a small room;
This makeshift room is lit by a kerosene lamp on a crate next
to a cot, propped up by a wall of trunks.
A DWARF "KINKO" (WALTER) is reading on his cot. He has red
hair. He and August greet each other with polite disgust...
AUGUST
Kinko.
KINKO (WALTER)
August.
AUGUST
This is Jacob. He's going to bunk
with you a while.
JACOB
How do you do?
KINKO (WALTER)
What is he?
AUGUST
I said his name is Jacob.
28.
KINKO (WALTER)
I asked what, not who.
AUGUST
He's going to help out in the
menagerie.
KINKO (WALTER)
A menagerie man? Performers don't
bunk with working men.
There's a growl from his loyal Russell terrier, QUEENIE.
AUGUST
Well there are performers..
(his hand indicates high
STANDARD)
And then there are performers..
(his hand indicates lower
"Kinko" standard)
Considering we used to keep the
goats in here, I'm sure Marlena's
horses out there object to now
sharing their quarters with you. Of
course I can always change that and
send you back to a bottom bunk with
the other kinkers who sorely miss
your sunny personality and
affectionate camaraderie.
(Kinko knows this threat)
This gentleman is the show's new
veterinarian - Ivy League no less -
which puts him a good deal higher
than you in my estimation. Perhaps
you'd like to offer him your cot.
As the kerosene lamp light flickers in August's face, Kinko
knows he has no choice. August smiles and turns to leave.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
I'll find you in the morning. Sleep
well, Cornell.
August exits....Jacob is left staring at resentful Kinko and
Queenie, who snarls at him. Jacob tries to be friendly:
JACOB
A Jack Russell. They're very smart.
KINKO (WALTER)
(CALMLY)
Queenie attack.
29.
Queenie jumps at Jacob, growling, hunch backed. Jacob is
pressed against the wall. Kinko returns to his book.
KINKO (WALTER) (CONT'D)
You're not getting the cot.
Jacob, Marlena and August arrive at the stall to see Silver
Star is laying down. He is breathing heavily, his rib cage
rising and falling. Jacob immediately senses the worst.
AUGUST
Jesus, Marlena, he wasn't this bad
in the show.
Jacob moves to examine the horse, but he flinches in pain.
Marlena takes over, by sitting besides Silver Star's head,
and stroking his head while singing a soft lullaby.
Jacob registers Marlena's soothing effect causes Silver Star
to relax...his breathing grows calmer. So Jacob begins to
examine him as Marlena watches protectively.
Jacob runs his right hand down the leg to the fetlock. He
lays his hand on the hoof then place his thumb and forefinger
on the back of the fetlock. He looks at the sole of the hoof,
which is bulging and dark with a red line around the edge.
Jacob's expression tells us this is a bad sign.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Is that the problem?
(JACOB NODS)
Do you need any hoof testers?
Diamond Joe has them...
JACOB
Not yet.
AUGUST
Well, how are you going to fix it?
Marlena looks at him coolly, expecting an explanation. Jacob
doesn't want to tell her the truth.
Jacob looks to August and rises, leaving Marlena with the
horse. Jacob pulls August away to whisper.
JACOB
I didn't want to say anything in
front of... Mrs. Rosenbluth...he's
already foundering.
AUGUST
English.
33.
JACOB
This horse isn't getting back on
his feet, August. If there was
anything I could do, I would but
we're going to have to put him
down...I'm real sorry.
Beat. August's stares at Jacob - or rather, stares through
him. A dead stare that lasts just a beat or two too
long...And then just as suddenly, the look is gone:
AUGUST
I know you are. Come with me.
August exits. Jacob doesn't know what this means. He follows.
The cat dens have two compartments: to the left is a pair of
lions. To the right, a tiger and a panther. All are massive.
As soon as Jacob appears, they lift their heads ominously.
August has unlocked the dens but left the padlock hanging on
the cage bars. The animals can smell the buckets now. They
growl. Jacob is a bit unhinged:
JACOB
What do I do, just open the door
and toss it in?
AUGUST
Unless you think a formal sit-down
is appropriate.
Jacob approaches the tiger first. The six hundred pound cat
rises then roars, his massive head hitting the cage and
rattling the lose padlock. Jacob freezes.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Why don't you start with Rex...
that's him on the left.
August is pointing to one of the lions - with a ratty mane
and visible rib cage. Smaller than the tiger, Jacob has a bit
more nerve. He reaches for a bucket...August suddenly shouts,
unnerving Jacob even more:
AUGUST (CONT'D)
WAIT!
(JACOB JUMPS)
Not that one, that one.
35.
He points to a difference bucket. Jacob can see no difference
between them, but no matter. He lifts the bucket and
approaches the lion's cage. Rex, the lion, lunges at the den
door. Jacob freezes.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
What's the matter? Didn't they
cover this in school?
August is having a grand time. Jacob smirks. Rex is rubbing
his mangy coat against the cage bars.
Jacob fumbles, removing the padlock and laying it at his
feet. He lifts the bucket and waits. When Rex turns away from
the cage door, Jacob swings it open. But before he can spill
out the contents of the bucket:
Rex turns and chomps his huge jaw down on Jacob's arm. JACOB
SCREAMS. The bucket drops, spilling the entrails inside which
cause Rex to release Jacob's arm and attack the food.
Jacob slams the cage shut and checks to see if he has an arm.
He does but it is dripping with saliva and as red as if he'd
dipped it in boiling water. But no skin is broken.
August is hysterically laughing. Furious, Jacob storms off;
JACOB
What the hell is wrong with you?
You think that's funny?
AUGUST
(LAUGHING)
Yes I do! Aw Jacob wait! Don't be
sore! I was having a little fun!
JACOB
FUN! I could have lost my arm!
AUGUST
(LAUGHS)
Rex hasn't got any teeth...
Jacob feels more foolish and walks away, when, just as
quickly, August's tone of voice turns darker:
AUGUST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Jacob..
Jacob stops and turns. August isn't laughing any more. He has
that sniper's stare of August's darker side...August moves
towards Jacob, almost menacingly, as he speaks;
36.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
..people want their money back when
the Star Act on the poster isn't in
the ring! A Star Attraction keeps a
circus alive. Without it, animals
eat that and men eat nothing. It
takes time to find and train
another horse so without Silver
Star, I have no Star Act.
JACOB
I don't know how he's been
performing August, but you don't
have a Star Act now. That horse
can't walk and if he does you'll
lose him. He's in a lot of pain.
AUGUST
Like this?
August squeezes Jacob's sore arm from Rex's attack. Jacob
cries out in pain as August holds his grip yet speaks calmly;
AUGUST (CONT'D)
We always have choices, Jacob - a
choice between our pain and someone
else's. That horse was performing
before you came and he will
continue to perform until he drops
dead. I'm telling you to keep it
alive and that's what you'll do or
you'll be red lit like anyone else
who doesn't obey the law here.
Every nation has it's own laws
under God, Jacob. You left America
the second you jumped my train. I
like you. Believe me, I do. I'm
only thinking of your future.
August lets go of his arm and walks away. Jacob is angry.
Angry, Jacob inspects his arm - swollen and red from Rex's
mouth. He hears: O.S. murmuring coming from Silver Star's
stall. He approaches to find Marlena sitting at Silver Star's
head, stroking his nose and humming the lullaby.
Marlena strokes Silver Star as Jacob appears. And Marlena
speaks to him for the first time;
37.
MARLENA
Tell me the truth. What's wrong
with him?
Jacob hesitates before answering, then:
JACOB
The connective tissues between the
hoof and the coffin bone are
compromised and the coffin bone
rotates toward the sole of the
hoof. If he keeps walking, it'll
puncture through...He's in a lot of
pain.
MARLENA
And if he rests?
JACOB
You'll lose him anyway. I'm sorry.
Marlena breaths in this bad news and braces herself, tears
welling up in her eyes.
MARLENA
Then you have to put him down.
Jacob is impressed by her...and a little surprised.
JACOB
It's the right thing to do.
MARLENA
But August won't let you.
JACOB
(Beat. Then:)
If I'm the show's vet then it's my
decision, isn't it?
MARLENA
But August won't like it.
JACOB
Then it'll be my last decision.
Marlena is impressed by Jacob. And surprised. She doesn't
quite know what to make of him.
38.
Jacob jumps into the Ring Stock car with the rifle as Kinko
exits his room with Queenie. Queenie growls.
KINKO
What do you think you're doing?
JACOB
Shut-up! Both of you!
Jacob continues on to Silver Star and Marlena.
JACOB (CONT'D)
You should go.
MARLENA
No. I'll keep him calm.
Jacob respects Marlena's fortitude...Jacob raises the rifle
and aims, trembling...Stoic Marlena, tears in her eyes, turns
her face away...Jacob pauses, upset...then...shoots.
39.
Jacob's distraught expression tells us everything as the
rifle slides to his side. He looks to Marlena. This is their
first moment of intimacy. She rises and takes the rifle from
his grip. She sees his arm bruised from the cats. She seems
to know what it means. She offers a respectful farewell.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
I'll be sorry to see you go, Mr.
Jankowski.
She exits O.S. with the rifle.
The yaks are motionless. Flies buzz around their head and
ears. Jacob swats them away...The Polar Bear is on his
stomach, breathing heavily. Jacob smooths his coat....Jacob
leans down and hoists a bucket of ice, scattering the ice
near the polar bear who rolls closer to it.
Jacob sees Rex, lying on his side in his cage, panting with
thirst. He brings a bucket of water to Rex's cage and opens
it. Rex gets to his feet but this time Jacob doesn't flinch.
He isn't frightened. He gives Rex the bucket of water. Rex
drinks as Jacob strokes his mane, which Rex allows...
JACOB
Friends now?
August calmly enters the menagerie with the rifle. He walks
to the center and stops, staring at Jacob.
Jacob goes about caring for the animals - moving from one to
the next - trying not to be unnerved by August's presence.
Then August does a surprising thing: He sits in the center of
the menagerie, crossed legged, with the rifle beside him.
AUGUST
You've got a gift for them. Like
Marlena with horses. It's God-
given. I can always spot it.
Jacob takes Bobo out of his den. Bobo hugs him tightly. He
continues on as he replies;
JACOB
My father used to say that to me.
AUGUST
He must have been a wise man.
40.
This stops Jacob. Beat. He turns to August.
JACOB
How is Marlena?
August tilts his head curiously, with a smile.
AUGUST
You're a genuine curiosity Jacob
Jankowski. What am I to do with
you? ... I threaten to throw you
off a moving train, feed you to my
lions and you go ahead and shoot my
star horse anyway. So I think -
Jacob's an educated man. For Jacob
to disobey me and shoot that horse,
that horse must have been in pretty
bad shape. Perhaps bad enough to
injure my Marlena during the show.
And so I think Jacob Jankowski
might be a valuable person to have
around.
JACOB
Tell Diamond Joe the animals need
more water when the humidity's this
bad if I don't see him before I go.
AUGUST
You're not going anywhere. You
belong here. These animals..they've
been waiting for you.
Jacob doesn't know whether to believe him or not. Then:
AUGUST (CONT'D)
But don't ever disobey me like that
again. I'll give you this one. I'll
call it "respect"...Next one I call
"betrayal". Understood?
(JACOB NODS)
I do thank you though. You and
Silver Star solved a much bigger
problem for me.
August pulls a pack of Camels from his pocket.
JACOB
What problem?
August lights, inhales, blows smoke then:
41.
AUGUST
The cats. You see, meat eaters are
always more valuable to a circus
than hay burners. And you saw what
we had to feed them.
JACOB
What does Silver Star have to do
with the cats?
AUGUST
We should have just enough food for
them to get us to the next show,
thanks to you. Of course Marlena
won't speak to me for a day or two
but she'll come around...So, I was
right. You are a valuable man.
As he walks away, rifle over his arm, Jacob is unnerved;
JACOB
August, what did you do? August?
Queenie sleeps. Kinko reads comic book porn inside a book of
Aristotle's Poetics. Jacob sits on his bed thinking.
JACOB (V.O.)
I couldn't stop thinking about
Marlena. I didn't see her for three
days. Our shows were cancelled and
we kept moving because, word was,
August found a "dead one"...
The train wheels screech as it begins to stop. Jacob rises
and looks out of open train car doors..
As the train pulls into Goshen, performers stick their heads
out the window to see....Jacob sits in the open stock car
with Kinko and Queenie:
42.
JACOB
Why are we stopping?
KINKO
August loves his sideshow freaks.
There's a guy with this outfit who
has a parasitic twin growing out of
his chest. He dresses it in a tiny
tuxedo and black patent leather
shoes. No talent but a real money-
maker with the rubes. Calls himself
the Man and a Half. Goddamn
August'll pay him double what he
pays me just for the irony.
JACOB
What happened to this circus?
KINKO
Went belly up. Pretty common
nowadays. Circus bosses see the end
coming and they'd pull a runner
with all the money. Menagerie
belongs to the town now. August can
get anything he wants for a song.
Jacob and Kinko watch August striding through the grounds as
desperate performers hopeful for work rush up to him.
KINKO (CONT'D)
Most of them will never belong to
another show. And they know it.
August is helped by Earl, who pushes the performers aside so
August can head straight for the Goshen TOWN OFFICIALS,
standing beside an Oldsmobile. They exchange greetings.
CAMERA POV: Dozens of Benzini Brothers work men are
dismantling and taking what they need...As our characters
walk through, this crowd of working men in constant motion
part the way to reveal:
ROSIE THE ELEPHANT: She is gargantuan. Ten feet tall at the
shoulder. Her skin is mottled and cracked from the tip of her
trunk down to her feet. Only her ears are smooth. She has
deeply set, amber eyes with extremely long lashes. She stands
tall behind a rope, chained to a stake in the ground.
Jacob, Marlena, August, Diamond Joe and Greg observe her.
JACOB
She has such long eye lashes.
DIAMOND JOE
She's a hundred if she's a day.
We're lucky if she can move.
AUGUST
Darling, what do you think? She's
magnificent, isn't she?
Marlena keeps her rage silent, but it is all the more potent.
August decides to ignore it. Jacob keeps his eyes on Rosie
but feels the tension between them.
ROSIE'S CARETAKER approaches: filthy shirt behind suspenders.
ROSIE'S CARETAKER
You the bull man?
AUGUST
No.
(Refers to Diamond Joe)
This is my menagerie man.
45.
ROSIE'S CARETAKER
Where's your bull man? Ya got no
bull man, I gotta tell the township
or else they can't sell her to ya.
August grabs Jacob's arm and shoves him forward;
AUGUST
Here he is. He's my bull man..
Rosie's Caretaker looks at the surprised Jacob, then:
ROSIE'S CARETAKER
All right. See this animal...this
here's the stupidest Goddamn animal
on the face of God's good
earth....Here's your bull hook.
You're gonna need it.
He tosses A BULL HOOK - a wooden rod about three feet long
with a four inch metal pick coming off the end - to Jacob.
AUGUST
I don't believe it. The mayor said
she was the best bull you had.
ROSIE'S CARETAKER
If she was the best bull, why is
she the only one left? You think
you're the first show to turn up
picking on the bones?
August is annoyed. As the Caretaker gathers his things:
ROSIE'S CARETAKER (CONT'D)
Some elephant tramp who dropped
dead in Genesee sold her for a song
which still ain't no bargain cause
she ain't done a damn thing since
but eat everything in sight.
(Starts to walk away)
Well, good luck to ya. And if I
don't ever see another dumb bull in
my life it'll be too soon.
(SPITS)
Rosie pulls her trunk from the trough. She lifts, aims, and
blasts the Caretaker with such a force, his hat sails off his
head in a stream of water.
Jacob, August, Diamond Joe and Greg bite their lips from
laughing. Marlena just stares into Rosie's eyes.
46.
The Caretaker stops, his hair and clothes dripping. He
doesn't turn, just stands still for a moment - then moves on.
August's enthusiasm is slightly dampened.
AUGUST
Joe, you and Greg come with me. We
have to find a car to renovate.
(TO JACOB)
See what you can do with her.
They exit. Jacob and Marlena are left alone with Rosie as
Flying Squadron men continue to work in the tent. There is an
awkward pause between them...then:
JACOB
Mrs. Rosenbluth, I hope I'm not
speaking out of turn here but - but
I had no idea they were going to do
that to Silver Star.
MARLENA
I know....Thank you.
This relaxes Jacob, but he senses she is still sad.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
And please, call me Marlena. I'm
not a snob like everybody thinks.
Jacob smiles. He faces Rosie and tries to cheer Marlena up.
JACOB
Hello Rosie, I'm Jacob Jankowski.
This is Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth.
Can you say Mrs. Marlena
Rosenbluth?
Marlena smiles as she watches Jacob stroke Rosie's hide.
JACOB (CONT'D)
You're a beauty, huh. Skin's a
little dry, you oughta take care of
that. First thing you notice about
a woman's age is her skin.
Rosie lifts her trunk and begins to explore Jacob's body.
Marlena giggles. Jacob plays it up to make her laugh.
JACOB (CONT'D)
Are you flirting with me young
lady? I usually like to make the
first move...
(MORE)
47.
JACOB (CONT'D)
(Her trunk taps his head)
I like to get to know a girl
first...take her out. Meet her
folks...
(Her trunk goes lower)
Of course, aggressive women can be
a nice change...
(She tickles him)
Jacob and Marlena laugh, her mood lightened because of Jacob.
MARLENA
I think you two are engaged.
They laugh. Jacob is thrilled to have this effect on Marlena.
A HARMONICA PLAYS A TUNE in the distance. They turn towards
the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent.
All the workmen have left.
Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them.
There is a awkward, lovely moment of intimacy between the
three as Marlena strokes Rosie's trunk. Her hand and Jacob's
come very close to overlapping. When their eyes meet, one of
them quickly averts their glance...There is clearly a growing
attraction between them. But it's uncomfortable.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
I think Rosie likes music. That
harmonica song is lovely.
JACOB
I'm confessin that I love you.
Marlena stops, her face flushed by Jacob's "confession".
MARLENA
What?
JACOB
The name of the song. "I'm
Confessin' That I Love You."
MARLENA
(overlaps, realizing)
--"Confessin' that I love you."
Beat. Jacob tries not to laugh. They return to stroking
Rosie, trying not to look at each other.
JACOB MARLENA
Louis Armstrong. Right.
48.
Jacob enters. Kinko is on his bed reading his "Aristotle" but
quickly shuts the book. Queenie growls at Jacob.
KINKO
Queenie stop.
Queenie stops. Kinko returns to his book. Jacob sees a NEW
BED ROLL AND PILLOW, upon which sits a LETTER. He reads it:
"MR. & MRS. AUGUST ROSENBLUTH REQUEST THE PLEASURE OF YOUR
COMPANY IN STATEROOM 3, CAR 48, FOR COCKTAILS AND SUPPER.
Jacob looks up to find Kinko staring at him.
JACOB
What is it?
KINKO
It's trouble, that's what. Not that
I give a damn, but you're playing
with dynamite with those two and
you're gonna blow all of us up.
August is the meanest sonofabitch
I've ever met.
JACOB
I admit he has his moments of
insanity but he's really a very
generous, charming guy.
KINKO
You don't get it, do you? When
August feeds your arm to a lion -
that's the real August. The one
who's generous and charming -
that's the insane August.
They hear a fight outside the car. They move to investigate:
Jacob and Kinko look out of the open ring stock car to see:
August is standing before A MAN who is being held by
Blackie's Men and punched by Blackie himself. The Man is
bleeding and bruised. Various other performers and working
men also watch the brutality;
49.
KINKO
Six men got red lit last night.
Cancelling shows and that damn
elephant cost August. He needed to
clean house to save on payroll...
It's a lousy day when an animal
gets paid and men don't.
JACOB
Why are they beating him?
KINKO
He hid one of the men who was
supposed to be tossed. Word was the
train was over a trestle instead of
land. Nobody comes back from that.
THEY HEAR:
AUGUST
Get rid of him. He comes back on my
property, you can shoot him.
August walks away, with Earl and his men in tow. Blackie and
his men drag the beaten Man away. As they turn, Jacob
recognizes the Man;
It is WADE who worked Jacob on his first day.
August, wearing a tuxedo, opens the door on the platform.
AUGUST
JACOB! Come in, come in!
Jacob enters their Stateroom which takes up half the car,
with an additional room, cordoned off by a velvet curtain.
The main room is paneled in walnut and outfitted with damask
furniture, a dinette and a Pullman kitchen.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Darling, our guest has arrived.
Jacob's eyes go wide upon seeing Marlena who appears looking
radiant in a rose silk, off the shoulder evening dress.
MARLENA
I'm so glad you could come. Would
you like a beer? Or champagne?
50.
JACOB
I'm not dressed for champagne.
AUGUST
We can fix that, can't we darling?
August winks at Marlena who giggles at their secret as August
ushers Jacob to the velvet curtain...
AUGUST (CONT'D)
We're celebrating our new star,
Rosie. My plan is to have the act
ready for the Manhattan/Jersey show
so she can start selling tickets.
(BEAT)
Unfortunately we had to let some
men go last night...
Jacob listens to how August will explain this:
AUGUST (CONT'D)
...I don't like doing it, not one
bit. But to keep hard working men
working, I had to get rid of lay-
abouts and thieves who are dead
weight. If I had the funds to pay
them all I would, but times being
as they are...I regret it though.
Jacob believes him. August turns to him, with cheer:
AUGUST (CONT'D)
So tomorrow, my faithful bull man,
we begin! But tonight - we dine!!
Tonight, we all deserve champagne!
August whisks the velvet curtain aside:
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Ta-dah!
A tuxedo for Jacob, who smiles, impressed.
MONTAGE: A PERIOD SONG COVERS THE IMAGES TAKING US OVER THE
COURSE OF THE EVENING ALONG WITH JACOB'S NARRATION:
- Three white-gloved waiters remove the domes off of silver
platters revealing oyster bisque, prime rib, boiled potatoes,
asparagus in cream.
- Marlena's dress barely covers her shoulders, exposing her
porcelain skin and the curves of her breasts. Jacob can
barely keep his eyes off of her during dinner...
51.
- Jacob is wiping his plate clean as August proudly offers
more. Marlena laughs at Jacob's embarrassment when he
realizes his plate is clean...
- Wine is poured over and over...as the evening continues.
- August is at the center of conversation entertaining
Marlena and Jacob. They are drunk from the wine!
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Jacob, I want to apologize to you,
in front of my darling Marlena so
she can witness how truly sorry I
am for any bit of nastiness between
us...Running this show, the many
pressures...It can get the best of
me sometimes I'm afraid.
MARLENA
People don't realize how much
August does holding everything
together. How difficult it is in
these times. The whole company is
like a family to him.
AUGUST
Thank you my love.
He kisses her hand then turns to Jacob;
AUGUST (CONT'D)
From now on I shall trust your
judgement in all things
veterinarian. Please say you accept
my apology.
Jacob is enamoured with August again, especially seeing
Marlena smiling in agreement.
JACOB
Of course I do, August. You've been
nothing but swell to me.
AUGUST
Good man!
(SINCERE)
I could truly use a friend I can
trust.
Jacob once again beams at the compliment as August pours more
wine. But Jacob feels a twinge of guilt. He stands to make a
dramatic statement. August and Marlena look up to him.
52.
JACOB
I have to tell you something. You
may not trust me after you hear it.
August and Marlena pause - giving Jacob their attention.
JACOB (CONT'D)
I never took my final exams at
Cornell. I'm not a real vet.
Beat. Then August and Marlena burst into laughter at the dire
earnestness with which Jacob made his statement.
JACOB (CONT'D)
But it's true. I never got my
degree. I'm not a licensed vet.
They laugh even harder.
AUGUST
BAH! A worthless piece of paper
from the ivy bush league! Of course
you're a vet. You have the gift.
You're idealism is just so...sweet.
When are you going to learn that
the rules written of, by and for
these united states of suckers do
not apply to us.
JACOB
Not about this, August.
AUGUST
All right, let me ask you - do you
honestly think this is the most
spectacular show on earth?
JACOB
(Beat. Then laughs)
No.
AUGUST
No. It's nowhere near. Lucinda, our
Fat Lady, isn't 800 pounds. Four at
the tops. And you really think the
Tattooed Man got tattooed by
headhunters in Borneo? He's from
Pittsburgh. Took him nine years to
ink himself. And you know what I
did when the hippo died? Swapped
out her water for formaldehyde and
kept showing her. For two weeks, we
travelled with a pickled hippo..
(MORE)
53.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
(Jacob & Marlena laugh)
..The world is run on tricks - in
here and out there. So trust me,
it's having a talent that counts.
In this world, it's all that's
real. Look at this country, these
dead, God awful towns we play.
Talent and illusion bringing life
to what is dead...Even for just a
matinee. How wonderful is that?
Jacob believes he's right. Marlena smiles in agreement.
August rises to toast. Jacob and Marlena follow.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
To talent and illusion!
JACOB
To Rosie!
MARLENA
And Silver Star.
August takes a beat and smiles warmly at Marlena...
AUGUST
To all we love.
He leans over and kisses Marlena longer than appropriate in
front of a guest. Jacob downs his wine, closing his eyes.
Suddenly, August grabs Jacob and Marlena and pulls them up to
dance, throwing his arm around them both as we hear: Louis
Armstrong's DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME.
August starts singing along, imitating Satchmo's voice,
encouraging Jacob to join in...August is a great performer,
filling up the space with his impersonation. Jacob can only
laugh along.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Come on Jacob! It's customary to
sing for your supper!
Jacob joins in to perform with August. Marlena applauds them.
August breaks away to dance with Marlena as Jacob sings. They
begin to slow dance, very intimately.
Jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered
chair, drinking more champagne. Jacob watches them dance:
54.
JACOB (V.O.)
He looked like a different man when
he looked at her. I said to myself,
maybe love does that to a man. I
didn't know much about it.
Suddenly, August kisses Marlena - a bit too aggressively.
MARLENA
Darling. Darling, please..
(GIGGLES)
Gently. We have a guest.
August stares at her. His expression darkens - locking his
eyes on Marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining
her. Marlena smiles and strokes his face. August doesn't
respond. He remains intense...
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Darling, what is it?
August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete
control, as if searching for proof of something he can't
trust. His grip tightens, hurting her.
Alerted, Jacob sits up, prepared to intervene...But Marlena
shows no sign of fear. She knows exactly what to do.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
August, dear...
She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
You don't know your own strength,
my love.
And then, just as quickly, August's expression softens,
relaxes, almost into sadness...as if he's about to
cry....Marlena senses it immediately. She whispers lovingly.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Auggie?
August stops and eyes the bed beyond them. He leaves Marlena
and throws himself face first on the bed.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Excuse me, Jacob.
Jacob watches as Marlena attends to August, lifting his legs
onto the bed, taking off his shoes. August begins snoring.
55.
Marlena smooths the hair out of his face then closes the
curtains and returns to Jacob in the main room.
JACOB
Is everything all right?
Marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there, as she
returns to her Victrola and selects another record. She
cranks it on and plays it low. A RUTH ETTING SONG.
MARLENA
Oh yes. He's just had too much to
drink, that's all. I hope you had a
good time tonight. I wanted so much
to make things up to you.
JACOB
Tonight was your idea?
MARLENA
Oh Auggie wanted it too, he felt
horrible about what happened. He
really does like you Jacob. But
it's hard for him. He's under a lot
of pressure. He does more than
people realize holding things
together.
JACOB
You said that.
MARLENA
Well it's true...
(Opens her arms to him.)
One dance before you go?
Jacob cautiously approaches. Marlena takes his hands but when
Jacob presses closely against her and places his hand against
her bare back, he almost swoons. They slow dance. Both tipsy.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Jankowski is Polish isn't it?
JACOB
(NODS)
Is that all right?
MARLENA
(LAUGHS)
Yes, of course, sorry...I just
think it's interesting. I don't
know what I am, besides August's
wife....I grew up in foster homes
since I was a baby.
(MORE)
56.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Kentucky, Oklahoma, Kansas,
Texas...I must have covered a dozen
states by the time I was 17. I'd
make up stories about who my
parents were...
(LAUGHS)
When I was five, I pretended for a
whole year my mother was an
Appaloosa mare...
They both laugh.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
I did! ... and I pretended that I
was really an Appaloosa filly...and
that I was just dreaming I was a
girl and one day, I'd wake up...and
I'd run home.
(LAUGHS)
Anyway, I was a lot safer inside
those stables than I ever was
inside those homes...
Marlena stops, not wanting to continue. Jacob finds a new
route for her conversation.
JACOB
What happened at 17?
MARLENA
There was a parade for the circus.
At the head, there were six black
Fresians, 17 hands high wearing red
tassles. So proud! So beautiful.
And August was leading them. The
second he looked at me, the way he
looked at me, I knew I'd never live
with strangers again. And the way
he talked. Told me "I'd find a home
in every city..welcomed in every
town...and he'd give me--
JACOB/MARLENA
-- a life most suckers can't dream
of"!
MARLENA
(LAUGHS)
Ha, you too, huh?
(JACOB NODS)
It's a wonderful lie, isn't it?
(JACOB NODS)
(MORE)
57.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
But he said he'd make me a Star
Attraction and he did. I'm pretty
lucky he found me.
Jacob, lost in her eyes and her voice, blurts out:
JACOB
He was pretty lucky to find you.
Marlena is surprised by the compliment...and endeared.
MARLENA
You're sweet to say so.
Beat. Feeling exposed, Jacob searches to change the subject:
JACOB
Pretty song.
MARLENA
Don't tell him what happened...
Jacob takes this as an intimate moment between them.
JACOB
Oh no Marlena, I won't ever tell.
Marlena smiles, laughs, using Jacob's joke back on him;
MARLENA
That's the name of the song. "Don't
Tell Him What Happened To Me". Ruth
Etting. She's one of my favorites.
Jacob's head starts spinning. Marlena takes care of him;
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Are you much of a wine drinker?
JACOB
I have no idea.
MARLENA
Maybe you should go to bed.
JACOB
(NODS)
Where's that?
Marlena laughs. Jacob's bow tie is undone - she ties it;
58.
MARLENA
Here, let me...We can't let you go
out there all untied. A circus is a
small town. What will people say?
As Marlena ties his tie, Jacob's eyes simply rest on
Marlena's face - sinking deeper in love. When Marlena
finishes, she looks up to Jacob...She can tell Jacob is
enamoured. She smiles warmly, touching his cheek...
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Sweet, sweet Jacob...
JACOB
(SENSITIVE ISSUE)
I'm not that sweet.
MARLENA
(Lowers her hand)
Good night.
Marlena turns and disappears behind the velvet curtain. Jacob
stands still for a moment, then exits.
Jacob hops up into the car. Kinko is giving a party, with a
bottle in his hand and drunken hospitality on his face.
Thirty performers cram the area usually occupied by Marlena's
horses, including BARBARA and another Coochie girl, NELL.
Kinko and Queenie are performing tricks. Jacob watches. He
admires the talent and humor of Kinko and Queenie's act. At
the end, the girls laugh and applaud. Jacob joins in:
JACOB
BRAVA QUEENIE! BRAVA!
But the sound of Jacob's voice immediately makes Queenie stop
and growl at him. Jacob stops.
Kinko, Barbara and the Coochie girls stop laughing and stare
the drunken young man, with his shirt out of his pants. He is
ripe for the picking! They get an idea!
59.
KINKO
JACOB MY FRIEND!! Folks, this is my
friend and roommate Jacob. I'd like
you all to make him feel at home!
Kinko starts laughing uncontrollably and before Jacob can
protest or escape, Barbara and Nell approach him, moving in
for the kill. Blurry-eyed, Jacob staggers back but the others
refuse to let him leave. In fact, he is picked up bodily,
raised above their heads and transported to Silver Star's
empty stall as Barbara and Nell disrobe him.
IN BLACK OUT....WE HEAR A SCRAPING NOISE THEN SEE A SLIVER OF
LIGHT AS A LID IS OPENED.
Kinko opens the lid of a trunk, speaking to someone inside;
JACOB (O.S.)
Where am I?
Kinko moves about a car filled with racks of costumes, props
and an open trunk containing the hidden Jacob.
KINKO
Where are you right now or where
are you in an Aristotelean context
because right now you're in a
trunk.
Inside the trunk, O.S. Jacob lifts his arm to Camera and
discovers he is dressed in a red silk dressing gown...
JACOB (O.S.)
Where are my clothes? I'm not
wearing anything underneath this---
(THEN:)
OH MY GOD...SOMEBODY SHAVED MY...
KINKO
Huh-huh.
As Jacob struggles out of the trunk, we only see his arms.
JACOB (O.S.)
What the hell did I do last night?
KINKO
You threw up on Barbara...And maybe
Nell.
60.
JACOB (V.O.)
I feel sick.
KINKO
You look a little pale.
Kinko holds the mirror to Jacob. We see for the first time:
JACOB'S FACE HAS BEEN PAINTED AS A CLOWN.
Jacob races through each car - past musicians, clowns and the
Coochie Girls - clutching his robe, rubbing the make-up off.
Along the way, the circus company taunt and tease him with
sexy hoots and hollers. Kinko follows him, delighted.
Having cleaned up, Jacob is dressing in his own clothes.
Kinko sits on his cot "reading Shakespeare" with a melancholy
Queenie at his side. When Jacob scratches his shaven balls...
KINKO
Your balls itchy?
JACOB
YES THANK YOU!
Pissed off, Jacob continues to dress.
KINKO
It'll grow back. Aw come on, you
still store about last night? Now I
figure we're even. In fact, I
probably owe you one. Feel free to
borrow a book.
JACOB
Let's just drop it.
Kinko opens a book to read. Jacob notices Queenie's quiet.
JACOB (CONT'D)
What's wrong with Queenie?
KINKO
What do you mean "wrong"?
61.
JACOB
I mean she's not hating me.
Something's wrong.
KINKO
(Concerned, pets her)
Yeah, she's been like this all day.
I don't know...she must have eaten
something. She did her business and
it was kind of...watery.
JACOB
Her stool? Did you look at it for
parasites?
KINKO
(SHAKES HEAD)
I don't like looking at my own.
JACOB
Get some honey from the cookhouse.
And if you can find any slippery
elm powder. But the honey should do
it. If not, we'll check her for
parasites.
Jacob starts to exit. As Kinko reads his book;
KINKO
Jacob?
(JACOB STOPS)
Thanks.
JACOB
Sure Kinko.
He moves to exit again. Kinko never looks up from book;
KINKO
Jacob?
JACOB
Yeah.
KINKO
My real name's Walter.
They never look at each other but a friendship is formed.
Jacob exits.
62.
Rosie's flesh is dotted with wounds from August's bull hook.
Jacob is applying zinc ointment to them.
JACOB
I'm so sorry girl. Just a few more
here. Hold still.
The un-staked canvas flaps behind Rosie wave up with the
breeze....Rosie's trunk rises. She smells something from
outside the tent.
When Jacob bends down for more ointment, Rosie tries to turn
around but her chain is still staked into the ground. As
Jacob straightens up, he sees:
Rosie's trunk carefully wrap itself around the stake and pull
it up out of the ground....She then manages to turn herself
around, her butt to Jacob. Rosie's trunk then dives down and
up under the canvas flaps.
66.
JACOB (CONT'D)
Rosie?
Rosie's trunk gathers up the stake and then stakes it back
into the ground. Jacob can't believe his eyes. He laughs.
Jacob watches as Rosie makes it twenty feet down the
hippodrome track then stops.
Without missing a beat, Marlena yanks herself upright, beams
a smile and thrusts her hands in the air, her back arched,
her toes pointed - as if it were all a part of the act.
The crowd goes wild - clapping, throwing peanuts, whistling.
Rosie only moves in fits and starts, causing the rest of the
Spec to pass them by at times. She trots ahead of August and
then when August reaches her she stops, making August halt
awkwardly. August feels humiliated until:
The crowd laughs, thinking it's the act. They applaud.
August realizes the crowd loves it. So August, the performer,
starts to play the infuriated fool to the audience, acting
comically angry and frustrated with Rosie..
But when he turns back to Rosie, he is red-faced with real
anger, poking under her shoulders with the bull hook.
After three stops and starts, August plunges the bull hook
sharply into her shoulder blade...and Rosie takes off at a
faster speed, curling her trunk in the air. The crowd cheers!
69.
Marlena grasps Rosie's halter as they fast approach the
dangerous pole above the entrance. If Marlena doesn't bail,
she'll be knocked off by the pole.
Jacob, August, the Spec and the audience watch enthralled as
Rosie charges toward the entrance...when suddenly:
Marlena lets go of the halter and leans hard to the left.
Just as Rosie bolts out of the Big Top, Marlena grabs hold of
the pole above the entrance and is left hanging there as
Rosie exits the Big Top...
For a moment, the audience doesn't know if this is part of
the act. Jacob wants to run to help her...
But Marlena quickly decides what to do; She lets go of the
pole with her left hand and quickly swings around so she is
facing the audience, still hanging from the pole.
Her face lights up and she points to her toes. The Band
Leader takes this as a signal and conducts the band into a
drum roll. The crowd relaxes and applauds.
Marlena begins swinging, gaining momentum as the band roll
mounts. Soon, in one final burst of performance inspiration,
she releases herself from the pole, sails through the air
tucking her body into a ball, rolling twice, uncurling for
one sideways rotation and lands firmly in the sawdust in her
feet. She straightens up and thrusts her arms in the air.
The crowd goes wild. The Band plays victory music. Coins are
thrown from the bleachers. Even the Spec performers cheer.
August acknowledges the audience's response by bowing as if
it were all his creation.
But after a moment, Jacob can see Marlena is in pain as she
turns and subtly limps out of the Big Top. He follows her.
August is beating Rosie, who cries out with each blow. The
animals are panicking from inside their cages - the lions
roaring, the monkey's squealing. Marlena freezes at the
entrance as Jacob runs to August.
MARLENA
AUGUST...STOP!!!
August turns to see her. Enraged, he stops Jacob with:
AUGUST
Get her out of here! NOW!
Jacob wants to help Rosie but can not disobey August in this
moment. He returns to Marlena and ushers her out, as August
continues to beat Rosie.
Rosie is lying on her side, her foot still chained to the
stake. She is quivering, riddled with bloodied holes.
Jacob is kneeling, applying zinc ointment, not knowing where
he can touch that won't hurt her. He is heart broken.
JACOB
Rosie, what am I going to do with
you?
Rosie's eyes look up to him, her lashes blinking. Her trunk
lifts and wipes at her own eye.
74.
Greg appears with a bucket and several bottles of whiskey. He
begins pouring whiskey bottles into a bucket.
GREG
Here this will help. Poor beast. He
really hurt her. Told you about
him.
(Curses August in POLISH)
Don't understand why a man like
that wants to be around animals in
the first place. He shouldn't have
the right, if you ask me.
Listening to Greg, Jacob gets increasingly angry. He sees the
bull hook. He grabs it and marches out of the menagerie.
Jacob reaches the platform to find the door ajar. He moves
through it. The stateroom is in a shambles. An open suitcase
of women's clothes lies strewn across the floor.
AUGUST (O.S.)
Marlena...!
August appears from behind the curtain ; he looks
uncharacteristically distraught...teary eyed and unkempt.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Do you know where Marlena is? Did
she send you?
JACOB
No....What happened?
AUGUST
She won't speak to me...
He can't finish. He sits, burying his head in his hands.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
...She won't let me apologize...
She won't forgive me.
75.
Jacob is astounded by August's sad, pitiable state.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
I don't know what happens to me,
Jacob. When I saw that bull running
wild with Marlena, I...I lost my
mind. But it's because I love her.
Why can't she understand that?
(Jacob stands coldly)
Isn't there anyone who understands?
(Jacob remains silent)
Ah, it's all my fault, I know it
is. I've spent too much money on
that bull. I can't pay the workmen.
Our debts are piling. We're losing
attendance at every show. I have no
Star Attraction. I don't know
what's going to happen to us if
Rosie doesn't sell tickets.
(CONFESSES)
If I lose this circus, I'll lose
Marlena - I know it.
Jacob softens, seeing August in this helpless, humble light.
JACOB
I'm sure that's not true.
AUGUST
Maybe you can talk to her. She's
tired of my apologies but, this
pressure I'm under...Of course,
that's no excuse for what I did...
(Rubs the images away)
...I can't believe what I did. Is
she all right? The bull. Rosie.
JACOB
She'll be OK.
AUGUST
Would you tell Marlena? And tell
her...tell her I'll do anything.
Anything she wants.
JACOB
August, I can't...
(THEN)
I'm sure she'll forgive you...She
loves you...Anyone can see that.
August wants to believe him. He seems more hopeful.
76.
AUGUST
Thank you. My friend.
Jacob nods, confused, his anger diffused. As he exits;
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Jacob?
Jacob stops and turns back as August asks:
AUGUST (CONT'D)
What were you planning to do with
that bull hook?
Jacob realizes he's holding the bull hook. August smiles.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Ha. You look like me.
Jacob looks in the mirror and indeed - with Rosie's blood on
his open shirt, bull hook in hand - he looks like a violent
man.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Maybe there is someone who
understands me.
August smiles. But Jacob is unnerved by the smile...and the
comparison. Suddenly, Earl enters and looks around, on alert;
EARL
What's going on?
AUGUST
Everything's fine, Earl.
August nods to Jacob, who pushes past Earl to exit.
Jacob enters to find Greg still treating Rosie.
JACOB
How's she doing?
77.
GREG
Oh she's a strong one, this one.
(TO ROSIE)
Jestes dobra dziewczynka
Jacob watches as Rosie lifts her foot and Greg rubs ointment.
Jacob sees the many empty whiskey bottles.
JACOB
Is she drunk?
GREG
(LAUGHS)
She's four tons..she'll just sleep
good.
(Screwing ointment top)
Potoz noge.
Jacob watches as Rosie puts her foot back on the ground.
GREG (CONT'D)
Masz, moja piekna
Jacob watches as Greg digs in his pocket and pulls out a
mint, brushing off the lint. Rosie's trunk investigates, then
nimbly plucks it out of his hand and into her mouth.
SUDDENLY, JACOB HAS AN EPIPHANY.
JACOB
Oh my God...
Jacob leads August to Rosie. A curious Greg stops tending to
Rosie. Jacob hands August a slip of paper with Polish words.
JACOB
Just read those out loud. To Rosie.
August reads the words in Polish with Jacob's help...
AUGUST
Rosie...da--da---
JACOB
Daj.
78.
AUGUST
Daj...daj..no-ge.
Rosie does nothing. August looks to Jacob. Jacob is worried.
Greg suggests, in a low whisper;
GREG
Might help if he said please.
JACOB
Say...Prosze Rosie daj noge.
AUGUST
Pros--Prozze Rosie...daj noge.
Rosie lifts her foot. August's eyes gleam.
JACOB
Go on.
AUGUST
(Reads and recites)
Rosie...potoz noge.
Rosie puts her foot down. August starts to understand.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
(Reads and recites)
Do tylu, Rosie! Do tylu!
Rosie sighs, shifts her weight, then takes a couple of steps
backward. August is amazed. Jacob is thrilled.
JACOB (V.O.)
That Fox Bros bull man didn't tell
us was the elephant tramp who sold
Rosie to them was Polish...
August grabs Jacob and kisses him on the mouth.
AUGUST
We've got a new star!
Greg remains cautious.
PRE-LAP : LIVE JAZZ BAND MUSIC.
The live band plays on a raised platform. The dance floor is
jammed with couples.
79.
Tables and U-shaped booths surround the dance floor. Tuxedoed
bartenders serve from a wooden bar lined with hundreds of
bottles in front of a smoky mirror.
August, Jacob and Marlena sit in a booth. They are drunk on
their third bottle of champagne. Marlena is wearing a
beautiful, low cut beaded red gown. Jacob can barely keep his
eyes off of her.
Marlena is particularly drunk - we've never seen her this
wild or spontaneous. She sings along with the band...she
keeps rhythm by banging her hands on the table.
However, she is acting distant to August.
August is happy she is having a good time. When he slides
next to her and puts his arm around her, Marlena stiffens;
AUGUST
Would you like to dance, darling?
MARLENA
No, thank you.
Awkward beat. Marlena takes her champagne glass and drinks
the last of it. August tries to make light of it.
AUGUST
We need more champagne.
JACOB
I'll get it.
AUGUST
No, you stay with Marlena.
August kisses her cheek, but Marlena is clearly still upset.
August lets her be. He exits O.S.
JACOB
You ever going to let him off the
hook?
MARLENA
Hook? That's an unfortunate choice
of words.
JACOB
Rosie's going be great. He won't
hurt her again. I know it.
MARLENA
Jacob, what you know about August
is pretty much nothing.
80.
Jacob feels put down. Marlena realizes that came out too
brusquely. She softens, and explains with vulnerability;
MARLENA (CONT'D)
You know how many star acts we've
had? How much money we've made and
lost and made...? Silver Star paid
for our new stateroom and look what
happened to him. Everything August
touches gets fed to the cats one
way or another.
(SADLY)
He'll never change.
Jacob is moved. Marlena shifts gears and rises.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
I want to dance.
JACOB
Maybe you should wait for August.
MARLENA
I want to dance now!
She pulls him up onto the dance floor. Marlena dances light
as air. She spins from Jacob then returns to his arms, so
that her back is to him. Jacob's forearm is on her collarbone
- skin to skin. Her chest rises and falls under his arm. Her
hair under his chin, Jacob can smell her fragrance - then she
unwinds away from, like a ribbon.
When the music stops, everyone applauds their dance -
including Marlena. Jacob beams. He looks up to the bar:
August stands stock still. His eyes glaring at Jacob. The
dark expression we've come to know. Seething with quiet rage.
Jacob takes a step back from Marlena when suddenly they hear;
OFF CAMERA SHOUT
RAID!! RAAAAID!!! EVERYBODY OUT!!!
PANDEMONIUM: Jacob is swept by a crush of bodies. People
scream, shoving their way towards the exit. Marlena is shoved
along with them, a few heads in front of Jacob.
Jacob reaches through the sea of flesh and grabs a hand. By
Marlena's expression, we know he has grasped her hand. Jacob
scans the panicked crowd for August but all he sees are
strangers running in every direction, people screaming..
Jacob's hand is ripped apart from Marlena at the doorway.
81.
Jacob enters the menagerie, heading straight for Rosie. He
gets on the ground beneath her and lies down...Rosie raises
her trunk to allow Jacob to lie beneath her.
DISSOLVE TO:
SAME LOCATION - DAWN
Jacob is asleep under Rosie when Walter wakes him up.
WALTER
Why are you sleeping here?
Somebody's looking for you.
Jacob and Walter enter to find Bill and Grady hiding an
ailing Camel in a dimly lit car. Jacob kneels down to him.
CAMEL
Hey kid. How nice to see ya.
JACOB
Hey, Camel. What's wrong?
CAMEL
I don't know, kid. Woke up a few
days ago and my feet was all
floppy. Jes can't feel'em right...
87.
CAMEL (CONT'D)
(CONFIDENTIALLY)
...It ain't just that though. It's
other stuff too.
WALTER
Like down there...man stuff?
Camel, his eyes wide and fearful, nods slowly.
BILL
What's wrong with him, doc?
JACOB
I don't know.
WALTER
Jamaica ginger paralysis.
Jake leg. I've seen it before.
CAMEL
No such thing. Is there Doc?
Walter looks at Camel's empty "Jake" bottle.
WALTER
The manufacturer started putting
this plasticizer in it, or
something, to get around
regulations that Jamaica ginger
extract not be sold as booze.
(TO CAMEL)
You're not supposed to drink this
stuff, ya know.
CAMEL
Well what the hell am I supposed to
drink to stop the shakes? It's
Prohibition and I ain't no Astor.
GRADY
It's OK Camel. Tomorrow's payday.
We'll get you some moonshine.
BILL
Grady don't lie to the man. If men
were getting paid, Blackie wouldn't
have tossed four of "em between
Boonton and Weehawken.
JACOB
Four?...Will he get better?
88.
Walter looks at him, his expression says No.
BILL
We can't leave him here. They'll
red light him for sure.
Jacob understands. He gets an idea and turns to Walter.
Walter understands and reacts with an adamant:
WALTER
NO! NO!
The cookhouse tent is divided into two sections by a curtain.
One one side: working men and the buffet table of food. It is
made up of benches and bare wood tables with salt and pepper
shakers.
The other side of the curtain is filled with performers. The
tables have a checkered tablecloth and flowers.
Marlena is sitting alone, drinking a cup of coffee. Jacob
approaches. He sits opposite her.
JACOB
Good morning.
MARLENA
Good morning Jacob, how are you?
Marlena smiles. Jacob senses others eavesdropping...but the
table is far enough away, so they can't be heard.
JACOB
I wanted to, uh...Is there any
chance I could speak with you
alone?
MARLENA
About what? Is something wrong?
JACOB
No, I...I just wanted to...Walter
said people are talking about what
happened...last night...
MARLENA
(LAUGHS)
Oh Jacob, champagne completely
overwhelms my senses..I always feel
the better for it when I abstain.
All I remember is getting pushed by
the crowd and then running and
getting a hole in my stocking. I
don't even know how I got home. I
don't remember a thing.
JACOB
Well, I want to apologize for--
90.
MARLENA
Ha,ha Jacob, it's silly of you to
apologize for my torn stockings.
You weren't even there.
Jacob is crushed by her reaction. Marlena maintains her
upbeat facade. August enters with his tray of food and
crosses to them. He is smiling like a man who has spent the
night having great sex.
August kisses Marlena right in front of Jacob. It is a long
sensual kiss...a holdover from their night together.
AUGUST
I slept like a baby after last
night. Thank you my darling.
MARLENA
August, please. We're in public.
Jacob understands his meaning and is quietly devastated.
AUGUST
(SITS)
Ah, nothing to be ashamed of. Man
and wife reuniting in the most
sacred of marriage places.
(BEAMING)
My Marlena has forgiven me. All's
well with the world again, right
Jacob?
(JACOB NODS)
That was quite an adventure last
night. I'm glad I didn't have to
bail you out. How did you get home?
JACOB
I don't know. I just ran.
AUGUST
(EATING)
How did you two get separated? You
were so close on the dance floor.
MARLENA
I told you, sweetheart. We got
pushed apart by the crowd. This
older married couple brought me to
the ferry.
AUGUST
I'd like to look them up and invite
them to the show free of charge...
(MORE)
91.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
...I'll even pay for their
transportation. I'd pay it a
hundred times over to anyone who
helped my wife to safety. Thank
goodness she had chaperones. If
anyone had harmed her, or even
touched her, there's no knowing
what I might do.
Jacob makes note of the implication. Marlena ignores it.
MARLENA ATOP ROSIE IN FULL COSTUME MAKING THEIR ENTRANCE TO A
PACKED HOUSE AS AUGUST LEADS THE WAY TO CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.
When they enter the center ring, they stop. August gives
Rosie the command to lift Marlena down with her trunk.
But Rosie hesitates. August commands her again, with more
force. But Rosie doesn't move forward...she shuffles a foot
backwards. August grips his silver tipped cane. Oh-oh...
92.
Jacob and other performers watch anxiously. Will Rosie fail?
Then August turns to the audience and mimes apologizing to
the crowd. When he back is turned, Rosie hits his butt with
her trunk. August freezes. The crowd laughs uproariously.
Jacob and the others realize it's all part of the act. Walter
slaps his back. Barbara kisses his cheek.
August displays great performance skills. He turns to Rosie
acting suspicious. Rosie lifts her head away, as if to say
"It wasn't me".
August turns back to the crowd to apologize and once again,
Rosie flicks his behind with her trunk. This time August
knows it her. He turns to her, tips his hat over his brow and
shakes his finger, scolding, as if to say, "No, no, no"
Rosie responds by waving her trunk, mocking him.
And the crowd bursts into applause.
August commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena with her trunk and
places her on the ground.
Marlena blows kisses to the audience. She skips theatrically
around the ring, with Rosie trotting behind her, August
hovering beside.
Marlena stops and wipes her brow, feigning exhaustion, and
sits on a small ball.
93.
Rosie observes her with a smile and a raised trunk. Rosie
copies Marlena's actions, placing her enormous rear down on a
much larger ball.
The crowd screams with laughter.
Marlena stands in mock outrage, wagging her finger at Rosie.
She turns her back on her, folding her arms.
Rosie also stands and presents Marlena with her rear end
facing the other way. The audience loves it.
JACOB (V.O.)
In that center ring, Rosie became a
guaranteed star attraction...
Jacob sits alone facing Rosie, in her massive stock car made
of steel, talking to her, in Polish...
JACOB (V.O.)
Alone with me, telling her every
thing I couldn't tell anyone else,
she became the closest thing I had
to family.
Marlena looks back and scowls. With dramatic flair, she
raises one foot and places it on the small ball as if to say,
"Take that, elephant!"
Rosie, not to be out done (guided by August's Polish
commands) curls her trunk, lifts her foot and places it on
her larger ball.
Marlena straightens out both arms and extends her other leg,
like a ballerina's, toe pointed. She place the foot alongside
the other, so that she is now standing atop the ball.
Rosie waits a moment, then lifts her other front foot onto
the ball.
The crowd explodes! August pretends to be outraged with
Marlena. But as showers of coins and money rain upon them,
August and Marlena stand beneath showers of glittering coins.
JACOB (V.O.)
And August! Ha, August was a new
man..
94.
Jacob, Walter and a Camel enjoy a card game and moonshine.
JACOB (V.O.)
..And with business so strong,
nobody was worried about getting
tossed, so we didn't have to worry
so much about old Camel.
August is filling a bucket with gin and ginger ale for Rosie.
JACOB (V.O.).
And nothing was too good for Rosie.
When August found out she liked gin
and ginger ale, he made sure she
got both every day, treating her
like some favorite child...
Marlena does a double take, then lifts up her finger as if to
say "I have an idea!". With a rising drum roll, she shuffles
her feet atop the ball, moving herself around the ring...
Rosie places all four of her feet onto the larger ball and
rolls herself around the ring...Marlena and Rosie go faster
and faster, along with the music...
THE CROWD GOES WILD....August takes Marlena's hand and kisses
it as they take their bows.
JACOB (V.O.)
But I didn't trust the new August.
I kept waiting for the real one to
show up.
95.
Marlena and Jacob are laughing, listening to August telling a
story after a private dinner. Jacob glances at Marlena...
JACOB (V.O.)
Maybe, I was the man not to be
trusted.
Marlena moves to August's lap. They kiss...Jacob watches
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Marlena looked happy...And it broke
my heart.
PRE-LAP AUGUST:
AUGUST (V.O.)
The circus is nothing without it's
traditions..
August has gathered all the performers and trainers in a
circle. Jacob stands in the center. Marlena beside August.
AUGUST
..It's a family. And like any
family, when a new member is born,
it's arrival must be greeted with
celebration and gratitude. Now,
we've been a little busy with sold
out performances, thank the Gods..
(EVERYONE CHEERS)
(MORE)
96.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
..but right now I want to take this
moment before today's show to
gather together..We close our
eyes..
Everyone closes their eyes.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
..and we thank whoever's up there
that sends desperate men running
for the rails..
Everyone laughs.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
..because it was a lucky day when
Jacob Jankowski jumped our train.
Because of him - together with our
beautiful Rosie and my beloved
Marlena - we have the greatest star
attraction in Benzini Brother's
history. He found a way to save us
all. And so, to officially welcome
Jacob into the family, we open our
eyes..
Everyone opens their eyes.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
..And we give him the traditional
Benzini Brothers baptism.
SUDDENLY, EVERY CLOWN PULLS OUT A SELZTER BOTTLE AND DOUSES
JACOB..BARBARA AND ALL THE GIRLS THROW HALF A DOZEN PIES INTO
HIS FACE AND BODY. OTHERS THROW CONFETTI, STREAMERS...
Jacob is a mess, covered in pies, seltzer and confetti. The
company breaks up with laughter, applauds and cheers...Walter
and Barbara bring Jacob towels, embracing and kissing him.
The rest of the company follows suit.
August motions for Marlena, who retrieves a large mens
clothing box and carries it to Jacob as August watches from a
distance...The crowd parts as Marlena hands him the box.
August watches Jacob open the box to find his own TUXEDO.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
Now you don't have to borrow mine.
Everyone applauds, hugging and kissing Jacob:
JACOB
Thank you, August.
97.
AUGUST
It's from both of us.
Jacob looks to Marlena. It is awkward between them. They
can't kiss each other. Jacob nods and says courteously;
JACOB
Thank you, Marlena.
MARLENA
You're welcome, Jacob.
As Marlena exits with the others, we discover August watching
from them a distance;
August's expression tells us he knows what they are hiding.
Rosie is staked into the grass inside Marlena's tent, happily
occupied with a pile of watermelons.
Marlena wears a silk beaded dress with the diamond necklace.
There is a serving table with silver domed platters and wine
bottles. Marlena is trying to open a champagne bottle when
Jacob enters.
MARLENA
Oh, he'll be here any second.
Jacob, can you open this for me?
Jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork.
Rosie's trunk is curious, inspecting the bottle in Jacob's
hand. Jacob laughs. Marlena sees and laughs as well.
JACOB
Rosie...get away....ssstop!!
Rosie continues fooling around, causing Marlena and Jacob to
laugh even harder when the cork pops...
AUGUST (O.S.)
What is this?
Jacob and Marlena turn to see August enter, laying down his
hat and coat, his shirt unbuttoned at the top.
MARLENA/JACOB
OH!....SURPRISE!..SURPRISE!
Jacob pours the champagne into two flutes, which Marlena
rushes up to August, handing him a glass and kissing him.
AUGUST
Did you show Jacob the opening
night present I gave you?
Marlena turns to Jacob and indicates the diamond necklace.
MARLENA
(indicating the necklace)
Oh. No...Do you see Jacob?
JACOB
Beautiful.
AUGUST
It looks stunning on you.
99.
They kiss again. Marlena raises her glass of champagne.
MARLENA
To August - an authentic miracle
man because he made a star
attraction out of me.
JACOB
To August!
August nods in gratitude. They tilt their glasses and drink.
AUGUST
Many thanks. Forgive me for
arriving too soon and spoiling the
surprise.
August takes out a cigarette and lights it.
MARLENA
Don't be silly. I couldn't wait for
you to come.
AUGUST
I could go back out to give you
more time...or better yet, yell
RAID and clear the place out so you
two can be alone.
In a split second, Jacob and Marlena know the danger present.
August gave no sign of it coming.
MARLENA
What?
AUGUST
I'm sorry. I'm probably wrong. I
assumed that night after the RAID
was the first time you two fucked,
but obviously it's been going on
longer than that.
MARLENA
Auggie, you're being silly.
AUGUST
Did you think I didn't know?
MARLENA
August don't do this!
AUGUST
Shut-up. SHUT UP!
100.
Marlena gets frightened. August saunters over to the silver
tipped cane leaning against the flap. He picks it up as
Marlena and Jacob remain still. Suddenly they hear:
Rosie peeing where she is staked. She too is frightened.
AUGUST (CONT'D)
How long did you think you could
keep this from me?
MARLENA
August, please, there's nothing-
AUGUST
GO ON! INTERRUPT ME ONE MORE TIME!
August swipes the tables with the cane, knocking all the
platters and glasses to the floor.
JACOB
We should go!
AUGUST
WE!...So you two are a couple?
JACOB
NO! I just don't think you're safe
to be around a woman right now.
AUGUST
A woman? This is not a woman. This
is my wife you Ivy League lying
piece of shit! Say, I bet the
authorities would like to know you
practise without a license.
MARLENA
Auggie, please... Don't you see how
much I love you?
AUGUST
I see you. I see you too clearly.
Always have. I have to admit that
was a nice touch when you got back
from the speakeasy. Being with me
in our bed, after being with him.
Covering your tracks. I should have
known a whore only performs for a
man like that when she wants
something.
JACOB
Marlena, come with me...
101.
AUGUST
YOU DON'T EVEN DENY IT! LOUSY
TRAMP!!
Marlena drops the fluted glasses, crying:
MARLENA
STOP IT!..AUGGIE STOP IT..PLEASE!
Suddenly, he's quiet. He stands still. Marlena approaches him
now, cautiously but tenderly.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Auggie? Are you all right now?...
August looks at her. Marlena's expression is one of care and
concern. Jacob watches carefully. Has it passed?
Suddenly, August flicks his lit cigarette into Rosie's open
mouth - Rosie reacts and Jacob moves to help her - as August
grabs Marlena, shoving her so hard she falls against the
table, knocking it and her to the ground. He attacks her,
trying to rip off her diamond necklace.
Jacob attacks August, pulling him off of Marlena.
JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT: savagely pounding each other's faces,
crashing against broken plates and spilled gravy, banging
their heads viciously against the ground, rolling over each
other as they alternately share domination...
Marlena screams for them to stop. Rosie bellows, pulling on
her leg chain.
The FIGHT SPILLS OUT OF THE TENT INTO THE CIRCUS GROUNDS.
Walter uncorks a jug of moonshine and hands it to Jacob, who
holds a towel to his bloody, beaten face. Jacob drinks from
the jug, panting, until the pain subsides. Camel speaks from
behind the trunks.
WALTER
The only thing that's keeping you
alive right now are the rubes who
saw everything. August can't risk
getting rid of you here. But you
better not get back on this train
when we leave tomorrow night.
CAMEL (O.S.)
What happened? Somebody turn me
around. Share some of that jug!
WALTER
Shut-up Camel.
CAMEL (O.S.)
Well, what the hell...!
103.
Camel uses whatever strength his has to push aside the trunk
and see bloody Jacob.
CAMEL (CONT'D)
Jesus Christ! Who did that to you?
WALTER
August.
(TO JACOB)
Is it true?
Jacob wants to deny it but his silence speaks the truth. He
can only manage to shake his head NO...But Walter can read
between the lines....He lowers his head in despair.
THE TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE. All three react with surprise.
JACOB
Why are we moving? We have a
matinee tomorrow.
WALTER
Something's gone wrong.
SUDDENLY, A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. The three men immediately are
on alert. Walter grabs his knife from beneath his pillow.
Camel tries to shove himself behind the trunks. THE KNOCK
COMES AGAIN as we hear:
MARLENA (V.O.)
Jacob? Jacob, it's Marlena.
They breath a sigh. Jacob opens the door to reveal.
Marlena with a black eye. Jacob rises to her.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. I had nowhere to go. I
told him I'm leaving him.
JACOB
My God. Are you all right?
MARLENA
Looks worse than it feels.
(Re: Jacob's face, laughs)
Ha, look at the two of us.
Marlena awkwardly enters the room to Walter and Camel's
stares. She sees the moonshine and breaks the ice.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
Can I have a swig of that?
104.
Walter throws her the moonshine. Marlena drinks like a pro.
WALTER
Why is the train moving?
Marlena sits with the jug, casually talking:
MARLENA
We're being run out. Apparently,
August was so optimistic about
money coming in for Rosie, he
figured he'd double down and find
himself a new fat lady to put him
really toe to toe with
Ringling...So he sent Mr. Erwin
into town who finds this rather
large woman in a restaurant and
offers her the job. Except, she...
(STARTS LAUGHING)
...she was the police chief's wife.
Mr. Erwin got a left hook in the
jaw and we got til morning to get
out of town.
This cracks everybody up. Laughter. A release of tension.
But the laughter turns to quiet sadness as the reality of
their situation sinks in....Marlena looks to Jacob and leans
into his arms. He holds her, clearly in love, then ushers her
out of the room for privacy.
Walter sees what he knew all along. He kisses Queenie:
WALTER
Aw girl. We're all in it now.
Marlena and Jacob exit Walter's room outside of which Marlena
placed her small suitcase. They pass by Marlena's horses..
MARLENA
Why are you hiding that roustabout?
JACOB
Because Blackie and his men don't
work the performer train and
they'll red-light him if they find
him. He can't work anymore.
MARLENA
My God.
105.
They come upon Silver Star's stall - empty - right before the
door to the next car. They stop.
JACOB
Does August know where you are?
MARLENA
No. He thinks I'm with Barbara and
the girls. He won't go there.
JACOB
He can't find you. As soon as we
stop - before we stop - we'll jump
off and I'll take you to a hotel in
town.
MARLENA
And after that? August has all our
money. Where will I go?
JACOB
Marlena, I'm not leaving you. We'll
find a way together. I won't let
you go back to him. I promise.
Marlena smiles, needing to hear him say those words. She
embraces him, grateful. Jacob holds her tight, assuring;
JACOB (CONT'D)
..I'll call my dean at Cornell..If
I can take my finals again, get my
degree, I can get my license.
They lay in the Silver Star's empty stall. Moonlit through
the wooden slats. Making plans...
MARLENA
Oh Jacob, that would be wonderful.
You know, I bet Ringling would take
us both then - they'd be getting a
vet and a star attraction - that's
a sweet deal for them. Although I
won't be a star but I don't care.
I'll take no billing at all...We'd
be safe from August if we were with
Ringling.
JACOB
Don't worry about him.
MARLENA
Of course, I'd have to wait a while
until I can work again...
106.
JACOB
What do you mean?
MARLENA
Jacob...I'm going to have a baby.
Jacob is stunned...then confused...
MARLENA (CONT'D)
It's yours. Please don't ask me how
I know...Is it all right? You can
change your mind. I'd understand.
Overwhelmed, Jacob keeps kissing her. Marlena lets go of all
the anxiety she had about him. He loves her. She knows it.
JACOB
Change my mind??? Oh Marlena,
please...please be happy.
MARLENA
(Cries, relieved)
I will...I promise...as soon as I
stop being terrified.
Jacob kisses her. He guides her to the ground, against the
hay. She nestles in his arms.
MARLENA (CONT'D)
I'm so tired.
JACOB
Rest...I've got you now.
Marlena tries, closing her eyes.....Then, without warning;
FROM THE ROOF, AUGUST, BLACKIE & HIS MEN JUMP IN THROUGH THE
OPEN STOCK CAR DOOR. THEY CHARGE INTO THE ROOM CAUSING THE
HORSES TO PANIC. THE THUGS DRAG JACOB AWAY FROM MARLENA,
BEATING HIM. AUGUST FORCIBLY TAKES MARLENA, HITTING HER...
MARLENA JACOB
DON'T HURT HIM!!!AUGUST NO!! MARLENA! MARLENA!...
AS BLACKIE AND HIS MEN DRAG JACOB PAST WALTER'S MAKESHIFT
DOOR, JACOB FIGHTS EVEN HARDER TO PULL THEM AWAY FROM
BREAKING INTO WALTER AND CAMEL'S ROOM.
FAST CUT TO:
107.
Kinko sits against the door, holding a trembling Queenie
hearing the screams and struggle. Camel quivers in fear
behind the trunks.
FAST CUT BACK:
AUGUST IS DRAGGING A SCREAMING MARLENA THROUGH THE DOOR TO
THE PLATFORM - TAKING HER THROUGH THE TRAIN BACK TO HIS CAR.
BLACKIE BEATS JACOB WHO CRIES OUT FOR MARLENA'S SAFETY,
HOLDING ONTO THE OPEN CAR DOORS. THE MEN BANG HIS HANDS WITH
THEIR FISTS UNTIL JACOB LOSES HIS GRIP AND BLACK TOSSES HIM
OFF THE FAST MOVING TRAIN.
Jacob opens his eyes. Walter is applying wet cloths to his
head. Camel watches nearby. Jacob suddenly rises;
JACOB
Marlena!!
WALTER
Sshh. Lie back.
JACOB
Where is she? Did he hurt her?
WALTER
I don't know. Your pupils are two
different sizes.
Jacob pushes himself up onto his elbows but his world spins.
JACOB
I have to get Marlena. What if he--
WALTER
Jacob, look at me. You've got a
concussion and you're on a moving
train. There's nothing you can do.
Marlena can handle him. She's done
it for years...
110.
JACOB
I have to get her.
WALTER
Jacob, you can't.
JACOB
She's going to have a baby.
Walter is stopped. Camel shakes his head.
WALTER
Does August know?
(Jacob shakes his head)
What have you done to us?
JACOB
We're going to Ringling. Me,
Marlena. You can too.
WALTER
I'm a fifth rate clown when second
rate circuses are folding all over
the place. Doesn't put me on top
of Ringling's list. They've got a
dozen of me in the wings. I
couldn't even go if I wanted to.
August won't pay anyone. Says the
show's debts have to come first.
First time in Benzini Bros history
performers haven't been paid.
People are starving out there,
Jacob. In the United States of
America. Starving. Where am I going
to go?
CAMEL
What about family? Like my son.
Gotta have somebody...a mother.
WALTER
Not a woman I have any use for.
She's sold me to this outfit when I
was 13.
CAMEL
She sold you?
WALTER
I'm not exactly cut out for farm
work. Don't worry about me..
(MORE)
111.
WALTER (CONT'D)
..If you and Marlena go, if August
doesn't kill you first - I'll know
what to do...I'll tell August how
well I got to know you and how I
can help him find you. Might even
get myself a better room out of the
bargain... It won't be anything
personal, you understand.
Beat. Each wants the other to survive at any cost.
JACOB
Do whatever you have to, Walter.
WALTER
You too, Jacob.
They exchange a final look, which is a goodbye. Walter turns
away from Jacob, holding Queenie to his chest.
Camel looks compassionately at Jacob and says:
CAMEL
Ya poor kid. The night this train
passed ya...you shoulda kept on
running, I guess.
Camel and Walter are snoring, asleep with their backs to
Jacob. Queenie is asleep, nestled in Walter's arms.
Jacob struggles to raise himself up. His world spins. He
holds tight to the bedroll, until the spinning subsides.
Jacob is a man with a mission. His eyes focus on: Walter's
Knife, sticking out from beneath Walter's pillow.
Jacob enters the stateroom, leaving the door open. He creeps
towards the velvet curtain which is closed. He grips the
knife. When he reaches it, he pulls the edge and peeks
inside.
August is asleep on his side, his arms locked around Marlena,
who is awake facing the curtain.
Jacob and Marlena's eyes meet. She sees the knife in his hand
August suddenly moves, pulls Marlena closer to his chest,
burying his face in her neck.
Jacob steps forward, raising the knife. His hands tremble.
The moonlight glints off the blade, throwing off light.
Marlena is looking up at him, tears in her eyes. She subtly
shakes her head "NO"...She doesn't want him to do this.
Jacob's hands are shaking now. The knife gripped in his hand.
He wants to rescue her, he's so close. We hold the moment...
Marlena's expression convinces Jacob not to do it...not to
cross that line and kill August.
113.
Defeated, Jacob kneels beside her and hangs his head. Marlena
reaches out to touch him...this time she really is saying
goodbye. But Jacob can not bear it. He looks at her for the
last time, then rises and exits.
Jacob returns to the ring stock car, hopping down from the
roof. The Horses are stirring, agitated. He calms them...
And then Jacob sees: the door to Walter's room is open. He
APPROACHES;
JACOB
Walter? Camel?
Jacob enters to find the room in a shambles. A terrible
realization comes over him:
Walter and Camel are gone. They have been red-lighted.
JACOB
WALTER! CAMEL!!
He finds Queenie, shaking with fear curled in a ball. He
takes her in his arms. Jacob panics.
JACOB (CONT'D)
No..no..no..no....!!!!
With Queenie, he rushes back into the ring stock car...he
checks everywhere calling out their names. He stops at the
open stock car door. The rain continues to fall. Jacob
collapses, holding Queenie to his chest. Tears fill his eyes
as he tries to hold it together, looking out the moving
train, his worst nightmare realized.
POV; IN THE DISTANCE, THE TRESTLE THE TRAIN PASSED OVER
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I wanted to believe taking Walter's
knife didn't make a difference. But
still. I left him without a
fighting chance. Maybe they
survived. Maybe they were tossed
over grassy land...I couldn't let
myself believe what I already knew.
Jacob falls apart, crying without shame.
114.
Jacob enters alone. He takes in all the animals who look back
at him. He crosses to Rosie and stands before her. Her trunk
greets him, stroking him. He presses his head against her.
Rosie comforts him. It makes Jacob fall apart all the more...
After a few moments, Jacob turns and walks away. He stops in
the center of the menagerie. He looks at each animal in their
den - in the same way as when he first met them - this time
saying goodbye.
Each animal is at the front of it's den or cage, looking at
Jacob. There is a silent exchange between them. Earl enters.
EARL
Come on kid.
When Jacob starts to exit again, something happens:
ALL THE ANIMALS BEGIN BANGING AGAINST THEIR CAGES AND SHAKING
THEIR BARS OR STOMPING THEIR FEET, SCREECHING OR ROARING OR
BELLOWING, AS IF IN PROTEST OF THEIR JACOB'S DEPARTURE.
The lock on Rex's cage busts a little as he rams against it.
Jacob shoots through the tent flap and is immediately flung
up against the sidewall as:
THE YAK THUNDERS PAST HIM, HIS HORN INCHES FROM JACOB, THE
HYENA ON HIS BACK. Jacob looks to the menagerie and faces;
A FULL FLEDGED STAMPEDE:
- ALL THE ANIMAL DENS ARE OPEN.
- CREATURES OF EVERY SORT...CHIMP, ORANGUTAN, LLAMAS, ZEBRA,
LION, GIRAFFE, CAMEL AND HORSES... RUN IN A MAD TERROR AS
THEY SCREECH, SCREAM, SWING, WHINY AND ROAR...
- MONKEYS ARE SWINGING ON ROPES, SLITHERING UP POLES
- THE CENTER CONCESSION STAND IS CRUSHED UNDER FOOT.
- A TOWERING POLAR BEAR SLASHES WITH HIS SKILLET-SIZED PAWS,
MAKING CONTACT WITH THE LLAMA, KNOCKING IT FLAT.
118.
Jacob is scanning the tent for Marlena when:
- THE ORANGUTAN RUNS THROUGH THE STAMPEDE DIRECTLY TO JACOB
AND CLUTCHES ONTO JACOB'S LEG. JACOB MOVES TO PICK HER UP
WHEN BOBO SWINGS FROM A ROPE AND JUMPS ONTO JACOB'S BACK.
Jacob manages to hold Bobo in one arm and the Orangutan in
the other as his eyes sweep the tent, searching for Marlena:
Then Jacob sees - THE PANTHER MAKES IT'S WAY THROUGH THE
CONNECTED WALKWAY TO THE BIG TOP AUDIENCE.
- SECONDS LATER, AUDIENCE SCREAMS OF TERROR ARE HEARD. THE
CROWD EXPLODES THROUGH THE BIG TOP, TRAMPLING OVER FELLOW
AUDIENCE MEMBERS...THEY CHARGE INTO THE MENAGERIE ONLY TO
FACE THE STAMPEDE..
- THE MASS OF ANIMALS CHANGE DIRECTIONS AND THERE IS AN INTER-
SPECIES FLOCK; LIONS, LLAMAS AND ZEBRAS RUNNING SIDE BY SIDE
WITH THE CHIMPS AND ORANGUTANS..A HYENA SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
WITH A TIGER...TWELVE HORSES AND A GIRAFFE WITH A SPIDER
MONKEY ON IT'S NECK...THE POLAR BEAR NOW ON ALL FOURS,
CHARGING...ALL OF THEM HEADING FOR THE CROWD OF PEOPLE...
- THE CROWD SHIFTS, RIOTING BACK INTO THE BIG TOP. CLOGGING
THE ENTRANCE...PEOPLE BANGING ON THE BACKS OF THOSE IN FRONT
OF THEM..
- THE CLOG BURSTS. PEOPLE AND ANIMALS FLEE IN EVERY
DIRECTION...
- A BENGAL TIGER FORCES ITSELF BETWEEN A WOMAN'S LEGS,
SWEEPING HER TO THE GROUND...
Searching and dodging animals, Jacob sees a flash of pink
sequins. He sees August with Marlena standing beside him, in
front of Rosie.
JACOB
MARLENA!
Marlena sees Jacob and makes a run for him, but August
quickly grabs her arm and flings her to the ground. She falls
out of view from Jacob.
Jacob runs to them, dodging the fleeing animals, when
suddenly: A BULL HOOK FLIES FROM OUT OF THE AIR ACROSS THE
ANIMALS AND PIERCES JACOB'S SHOULDER. He cries out.
Rosie cries out. She begins to stamp her feet. Marlena lies
with her face in the dirt, crawling beneath the ropes to get
under Rosie for safety.
119.
August pulls Jacob with a new bull hook, tossing him the
ground. August glares at him, his eyes full of rage;
AUGUST
YOU! YOU DID THIS!!
He attacks but Jacob dodges the next blow, grabbing onto the
bull hook and twisting it with such strength, it topples
August who refuses to let it go...
JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT SAVAGELY, AMIDST THE STAMPEDE. Like
madmen fighting with the intention to kill.
Jacob unleashes a rage and a strength we have yet to see in
him, as he beats August without mercy...
But August manages to overpower Jacob, unleashing his own
maniacal fury. By taking advantage of the bull hook wound,
August gets Jacob into a death grip around his neck.
Marlena screams out, unable to help as animals stampede
around the two men locked in combat.
Only Rosie, who towers above them, knows what to do.
Jacob, choking under August's grip, looks up at Rosie. She
raises her trunk to smile at him. Jacob looks down and sees
that ROSIE'S STAKE HAS BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND.
Jacob fights August to breathe as Rosie reveals she is
holding the stake loosely, resting it's end on the dirt. The
chain still attached to her foot.
Jacob flips himself which forces August to turn his back on
Rosie in order to keep his grip on Jacob.
Marlena covers her head in her arms, not wanting to see.
Jacob can not breathe..August is squeezing the life from him
AS:
Rosie lifts the stake as if it weighs nothing and brings it
down onto August, splitting his head in one clean move. She
continues to hold the stake until August topples forward,
dead, his skull opened like a hardboiled egg..
Released of August, Jacob rolls himself under the ropes just
BEFORE:
A HERD OF ZEBRAS RUN PAST, CRUSHING AUGUST BENEATH THEM.
120.
Rosie then slides the stake back to the ground. Marlena, head
hidden under her arms, sees nothing. The menagerie is clear
of the stampeding animals.
Marlena lifts her head up from beneath her arms, remaining
under Rosie. She sees August lifeless body. She looks to
Jacob. He rises, bloodied and beaten, but alive.
WIDE ANGLE: The empty menagerie except for: Jacob standing,
Marlena under Rosie and the two monkeys inspecting August's
dead body.
Two Children are delighted that a GIRAFFE is eating from
their second story window.
Camera discovers a DISHWASHER and REX THE LION, both
quivering, huddled opposite each under beneath a sink.
JACOB (V.O.)
I don't know who was more scared -
the rubes or the animals.
DICK NESCI and the Sheriff fight with Jacob over Rosie...
SHERIFF
...These animals are now the
property of Altoona and we're here
to sell them to Mr. Nesci.
JACOB
Not all of them! Some of these
animals are mine, like this bull.
DICK NESCI
Do you have any proof?
Jacob is stalled. Greg appears.
GREG
He's right. He's just an elephant
tramp. The bull is his.
JACOB
You don't want her anyway. She
can't do anything. Dumb as a box of
peanut shells.
Skeptical, Dick Nesci steps up to Rosie.
DICK NESCI
What's her name?
JACOB
Gertrude.
Jacob and Rosie exchange eye contact. Nesci is skeptical.
DICK NESCI
Gertrude! Gertrude, step up! UP!
Rosie blows and swings her trunk, throwing dirt across the
people around her.
Dick Nesci takes the bull hook and prods under her leg,
ordering her UP! Rosie just swings her ears and sniffs Dick
Nesci with her trunk. Then checks his pockets for treats.
Jacob exchanges a look with Rosie.
122.
Jacob is finishing his story. Charlie is enthralled. The
first bottle of scotch is gone. The second half full.
JACOB
I convinced my dean to let me take
my finals. Marlena was right. With
my degree, our animals and
Marlena's acts, Ringling got a
sweet deal. Our son was born our
first season. We named him Walter.
He spent the first seven years of
his life with Ringling.
(BEAT)
That's why I...I just can't
understand how he forgot to show up
today.
(His eyes glitter
CHILDLIKE)
There was a circus in town.
Charlie understands. He looks affectionately at Jacob.
JACOB (CONT'D)
By the time our third son came,
we'd had enough. Rosie was tired.
(Charlie smiles. )
Luckily, the vet at the Albany Zoo
dropped dead, so I got the job.
(MORE)
123.
JACOB (CONT'D)
We bought some property so we could
keep the horses...Rosie...then five
kids...Bobo and that
Orangutan...Never named that
Orangutan. Nothing ever sounded..
elegant enough for her. Just called
her Ma'am.
(Smiles with great joy)
Man oh man that was...that was a
life, boy, I'll tell ya...
Charlie smiles, appreciating this old man's big life.
JACOB (CONT'D)
And then before you know it, the
kids are borrowing the car and
moving out. Marlena and I on our
own again...until she passed.
This moment causes Jacob to pause. He still loves her.
JACOB (CONT'D)
I never told Marlena it was Rosie
who got August. I didn't want her
to know. When Rosie passed on, she
cried for days. I owe that bull my
whole life...my kids, everything..
A KNOCK. Charlie peeks through the window and sees a COP:
CHARLIE
It's the heat.
JACOB
They're here for me.
Charlie and Jacob exchange a look. Charlie understands.
Charlie opens the door to greet a LOCAL COP.
CHARLIE
Hi Officer, can I help you?
COP
Yes, I'm hoping you can. An elderly
gentleman went missing from the
nursing home down the street. Staff
seems to think he came here.
124.
CHARLIE
We had a lot of folks from the home
today. But no, I haven't seen him.
The Cop peers past Charlie and sees Jacob.
COP
Excuse me, but who is that?
CHARLIE
(Pause, then)
Oh....that's my Dad.
The Cop is suspicious. Charlie covers:
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
He can't talk. Had a major stroke a
few years back. But he's doing
well. Ain't ya Pop?
Understanding the ruse, Jacob starts to play the part of a
stroke victim: he opens his mouth, his jaw quivers. He
reaches for his glass with a shaking arm. Charlie helps him.
Jacob holds out his tongue like a parrot's as Charlie helps
him drink. The Cop watches with a blank expression. Jacob
swallows and nods speechless, smiles and manages to drool.
Beat. The Cop wonders. Then, pulling out his card:
COP
OK, well, thanks for your time.
Here's my number in case you hear
of anything. Sorry to bother you.
The Cop exits. Charlie returns to sit opposite Jacob. They
consider this unspoken proposal:
JACOB
You sure about this?
Beat as Charlie pours another shot. Then:
CHARLIE
I wonder if we can get you into the
book of records. "Oldest man who
ever ran away with the circus".
JACOB
Nah, I'm not running away. Just
coming home.
125.
Old Jacob uses his walker to enter the menagerie. He moves to
each animal meeting his eyes with theirs. Each animal gives
him a look of acknowledgment.
He comes to an ORANGUTAN...younger than the one from his
Benzini days. Jacob stops. He steadies himself.
Jacob lets go of the walker and reaches his arm out to the
Orangutan's cage.
The Orangutan studies him for a moment. Judging.
Jacob keeps his arm extended, which isn't easy for him.
The Orangutan then extends his hand through the bars to
Jacob's hand.
Jacob's fingers entwine around the Orangutan's hand. They
hold for a moment. Jacob smiles.
JACOB
Thank you, Ma'am.
