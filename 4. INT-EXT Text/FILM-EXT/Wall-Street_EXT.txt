FADE IN. THE STREET. The most famous third of a mile in the
world. Towering landmark structures nearly blot out the
dreary grey flannel sky. The morning rush hour crowds swarm
through the dark, narrow streets like mice in a maze, all in
pursuit of one thing: MONEY... CREDITS RUN.
The bubbling mass charges up the stairs. Steam rises from a
grating, shapes merging into the crowd. Past the HOMELESS
VETS, the insane BAG LADY with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags
huddled in the corner of Trinity Church...
Bud the Fox straggling behind, in a crumpled raincoat, tie
askew, young, very young, his bleary face buried in a Wall
Street Journal, folded, 'subway style', as he crosses the
street against the light.
BUD
Why Fox? Why didn't you buy...
schmuck?
A car honks, swerving past.
TWILIGHT
In the background, a 747 ascends into the night sky,
climbing over the roof tops of weathered brick tract houses.
Bud, coat collar pulled up against the wind, crosses the
street, entering a neighborhood bar. We see an old maroon
Honda behind him.
Bud, crossing lower Broadway, enters a magnificent towering
glass structure.
The upper West Side. The young, the rich and the restless
parade along the avenue, jamming the neighborhood restaurants
and bars. Bud glides along, feeling a part of the crowd now,
past a dreadlocked DERELICT swigging Thunderbird and
shouting obscenities, shaking a wooden African spear.
Bud and a DATE he's obviously just picked up, are struggling
to be seen in a mass of people trying to get in the hottest
new club in Manhattan. Bud easing forward along the ropes to
a large BOUNCER who roughly pushes one of the bridge-and-
tunnel kids back across the rope.
Joe discreetly shows him $50 but they guy says: "No room!,"
humiliating him in front of his date. The bouncer shoving
Bud aside as Gordon Gekko and KATE, his wife, and ENTOURAGE
(ALEX, others) are shown through the ropes into the door.
Bud says something to Gordon but it gets lost in the confusion.
People pouring into the subway on the way to work. Bud
rifles through the Financial Times he's just bought at the
newsstand and finds the article he was looking for: BLUESTAR
EXONERATED IN 1984 CRASH. He thrusts his fist in the air,
victoriously...bounds down the subway stairs.
A stretch limo is parked in front, neighborhood WINOS
inspecting it. The CHAUFFEUR opens the back door, as Lisa
steps inside, Buddy in tow. The winos clap, howling at her.
The CHAUFFEUR lets Bud out the door... Bud looks back at Gekko.
BUD
All right, Mr. Gekko...you got me.
His eyes telling us he is weighed down by chains of guilt.
Gekko smiles, gazes at the twilight skyline, a sudden look
of contentment.
GEKKO
Yeah, it's a beautiful night. I
love this hot stinkin' city.
(pointing up Park Avenue)
... nothing else like it in the
world. Seven million people living
on each other's heads, kids born,
millionaires dying, people praying,
junkies, whores, wills, lawyers,
deals, parties, sex... guys like
you sport -- dreaming about the big
score. You know the best thing
about New York is everything you
can do here. And the worst thing is
everything you can't do here...
He shuts the door. Bud watches as the limo drives off.
Bud, in a suit, waits next to a motorcycle across from one
of the most desirable addresses in New York.
The Doorman rushes to open the door under the canopy as a
tall strong man in his fifties emerges with a LAWYER TYPE
and a FEMALE EXECUTIVE. The man is SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN and
his manner and gait convey the impression of an authoritative
presence with little patience as the chauffeur opens the
door and he slides into the back seat of the limo.
Buddy, astride Marv's Kawasaki 500, hits the streets after
him. The music through the following Montage should suggest
a chase brio.
Bud shooting past the Trinity Church structure... Wildman
gets out of his limo with his people, strides into the lobby.
Bud quickly parks his bike on the sidewalk and rushes in
after them... not a second too late.
The street now jammed with people hurrying to work. Buddy
paces the curb, reacting when Wildman walks out, saying
goodbye to the female executive and getting in the limo with
his lawyer... Buddy follows.
Buddy waits outside, bored, as Wildman steps out, shakes
hands with the bankers... Bud making an entry into his
notebook like any good spy.
Music rising to triumphant proportions. AERIAL SHOT of Limo
emerging from the tunnel and onto the Long Island Expressway.
CAMERA MOVES IN, picking up Buddy on the Kawasaki, darting
through lanes, staying several car lengths behind.
The Limo winds its way along the perimeter road, past
commercial airliners. It takes the turnoff for Butler
Aviation. Buddy exits the ramp shortly after them.
A corporate saberliner jet, its engines running, idles at
the end of the taxiway. The limo pulls up along the tarmac
next to it and Wildman steps out, walking past a MECHANIC to
the stairs of the plane. A STEWARDESS waits for him.
Bud watches, wondering what to do as the plane taxies down
the runway. He spots the flight mechanic and the answer
comes to him. He starts running towards the mechanic.
Bud races up to the mechanic.
BUD
Oh shit, don't tell me Mr. Wildman
was on board that plane?
(the mechanic nods)
My boss is gonna kill me. I was
supposed to give him this.
(holding his notebook)
You know where that plane is going?
MECHANIC
(walking off)
Erie, Pennsylvania...
Wind and waves. Gekko's modern, Sante Fe structure house
sits on a dune overlooking the grey Atlantic.
GEKKO (V.O.)
Sweeten the offer, throw 2 bucks
more in a convertible preferred.
And 5 year contracts for themselves.
Bud's P.O.V. as he pulls up to an austere, ultra-
sophisticated monolith of glass and wood dominating a
stretch of dune overlooking the Atlantic's angry surf.
Several Jags, state of the art Jeeps and a Rolls are drawn
up outside.
Bud, getting out of his faded Honda, goes up the stairs to
the door. He rings several times.
A BLACK BUTLER opens it and looks at Buddy somewhat warily.
Laughter and voices are heard from inside.
BUTLER
(pretentiously: high
English accent)
Can I help you?
BUD
Bud Fox. Got some papers for Mr.
Gekko to sign.
BUTLER
Wait a moment please.
Without thinking he closes the door in Joe's face. He stands
there, harrassed peering around through a window on the lawn.
A small gathering of friends in progress around a glowing
fireplace. The butler waves him in from the door.
The sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up
over the ocean. Gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker,
restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing
around him. He's been up all night and has an exhausted,
driven look as he whispers over the wind into the cellular
phone...
GEKKO
Money never sleeps pal. When I came
in in '69, they traded six hours a
day, now the clock don't stop,
London's deregulated, the Orient is
hungrier than us. Just let the
money circle the world, sport,
buying and selling, and if you're
smart it comes back paying. I just
made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold.
It's been wired to you -- play with
it. You done good, but you gotta
keep doing good. I showed you how
the game works, now school's out.
BUD
(protests)
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
GEKKO
You don't understand. I want to be
surprised...astonish me, sport, new
info, don't care where or how you
get it, just get it... My wife
tells me you put a move on Darien.
Here's some inside info for you.
That Euroflash GQ guy she's going
with's got big bucks but he's
putting her feet to sleep. Exit
visas are imminent. So don't lose
your place in line.
(gazing at the surf)
Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this.
The lights coming up over the water.
I've never seen a painting that
captures the beauty of the ocean at
this moment.
(suddenly fatigued)
...an old Russian proverb - "a
fisherman always sees another
fisherman from afar." I like you
sport, I ever tell you that...
Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
BUD
(off)
...Gordon.
GEKKO
Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud
Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough
you can afford a girl like Darien.
Remember, power is the best
aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up
call. Go to work.
He lets the phone drop to his side, staring glazed-eyed at
the ocean.
Bud comes out of the building and starts walking away. As he
passes the freight entrance, Bud abruptly notices a van
marked MARSALA MAINTENENCE COMPANY. He looks back, thinks
for a moment: a look in his eyes.
Bud walks past a row of small warehouses and enters one.
Gekko, Kate, Bud, Darien and A FIFTH PERSON roar over the
dunes, each in their own dune buggy, laughing and hollering
at one another...
Buddy driving right up precariously close on Darien, who
screams... Buddy flips over his vehicle... comes up
laughing... we sense he is getting wilder now...
Darien rides expertly. A beautiful, immaculately-groomed
stallion is being shown to Gekko by the trainer.
Bud is sipping wine as he looks on with Kate.
GEKKO
(proudly)
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
BUD
How much?
GEKKO
(fondling the head)
Close to two million.
(Bud whistles)
But this sucker can go all the way
to Devon and the nationals.
Darien rides in, smiling to Bud.
BUD
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew.
What about the Triple Crown?
DARIEN
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a
jumper.
BUD
How would I know? I once bet a
horse. He went out at ten to one
and came in at quarter to five.
He laughs, a little sloppy.
Darien swims in the ocean, long looping athletic strokes.
They're finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower
garden where Kate and son Rudy play. HAROLD SALT, Gekko's
chief lawyer, thick glasses, smart eyes and bags of worry
that could only come from watching other people's money,
looks very city-like in his clothing, examining his
paperwork before passing it to Bud, who is the picture of
relaxation.
HAROLD
...You understand Mr. Gekko is
constantly barraged with nuisance
litigation and IRS audits.
BUD
(nods)
Of course.
HAROLD
...So it's in both our interests to
put a safe distance between you and
us...
(passing a document
with a 2nd pen)
...this gives you limited power of
attorney for Mr. Gekko's account.
Every trade you make is at your
discretion. Every ticket you buy
must be marked "power of attorney."
That means you call the shots and
Mr. Gekko has no official knowledge
of what stocks you're buying. Sign
here and here...
Buddy looks, then up to Gekko, who smiles, casual.
GEKKO
...just the beginning, sport, just
the begining...
Bud smiles, signs.
HAROLD
(a worrier)
...you understand if any problems
arise, you're out there on your own.
The trail stops with you...
BUD
All's fair in love and war.
GEKKO
The art of which is deception.
Spread the buy orders through
different accounts and you won't
get burned...
BUD
I think I got some friends that
won't mind making some easy money...
As Kate drifts over with Rudy and the French au pair GIRL,
NICOLE.
GEKKO
Rudy, viens ici, dit bonjour a
Monsieur Bud.
Rudy either says "No!" or "Bonjour Monsieur Bud!' depending
on the mood of the kid. Gordon sweeping him up and playing
with him. The kid squeals with glee.
GEKKO
(proudly)
Already speaks a little French, kid
got the highest score on his IQ test.
KATE
(to Darien)
...it's so tough to get into a good
nursery school now. They even visit
your home to make sure your
paintings and furnishings are
acceptable.
BUD
What's it cost these days?
KATE
$5,000 just for the tuition... plus
the books and supplies...
(with a look to Gordon)
...some parents even have bodyguards.
It's not a bad idea...
(picking up Rudy)
...now that's it for you with the
grown-ups young man.
As Rudy smashes the strawberries around his face and resists
going. "No! No!" Kate exasperated gives the child to Nicole.
KATE
Nicole, take him for a nap, please.
NICOLE
He doesn't nap anymore, Madame.
It's been...
KATE
(stung)
Then play with him till he gets
tired. We're going out tonight but
we like to see him at, let's see,
six; give him a bath and put that
cute little black suit on him...
(to Bud and Gordon)
Black clothes are the newest
things, so chic and milk stains,
carrot juice stains just don't show
up. Kids -- boy, can they take it
out of you!
Nicole's "Oui, Madame" is lost in the wrestling match she
goes through to drag him out screaming. Kate walking off.
Harold gives Buddy another piece of paper...
HAROLD
This is a contact at one of our
banks. On settlement day you'll
open an account there for Mr. Gekko
under the name of Geneva, Roth
Holding Corp. Then you'll wire
transfer the money to this account
in the Cayman Islands...
GEKKO
(rising, finished
with lunch)
Think about incorporating yourself
there, Bud, Harold will take care
of it for you.
(with a look to Harold)
... at a reasonable fee. You're
gonna make a lot of money now Bud...
stakes are gonna go up, no mistakes...
BUD
...piece of cake, Gordon...
The camera glides off some FISHERMEN hauling their catch off
their beached boat to Darien who comes tromping out of the
surf, water glistening off her lean athletic body. Bud
stands before her, cool seductive eyes, holding out a towel.
She steps up to him and smiles inscrutably. Takes the towel
from him, drying herself, instead.
DARIEN
(gazing at the beach)
If I could have anything... this
would almost do.
BUD
Yeah, almost...
Looks at her, stifles his thought.
DARIEN
(teasing)
So, how did your conference go with
Gordon?
BUD
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We
reached an agreement and decided to
divide up the world between us.
DARIEN
(laughs)
You have modest wants. I like that
in a man.
BUD
And what do you want?
DARIEN
...a Turner, a perfect canary
diaiaond... a Lear jet... world
peace... the best of everything...
BUD
Well, why stop at that?
DARIEN
I don't.
BUD
(has to smile)
You're not trouble by any chance.
Are you?
She looks at him, tosses the towel over her shoulder and
starts back toward the house. Buddy watches her go.
Bud walks out alone in his blue bathrobe on his parapet
overlooking Central Park. The wind stirs his hair. The East
and West sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond
necklace of brilliant light.
Bud stares down at the world. He has it all now. The money.
The girl. The magic palace apartment. What more is there?
Something...because Bud suddenly throws a wrenching
dislocated look into himself that makes us wonder as he
brushes his hand across his face and mutters to himself.
BUD
Who am I?
There is no ready answer. As he finally turns and goes back
inside and closes the door.
Cocktail hour in the background, yuppies trying to score for
the weekend. Bud on the phone, strained look transforming to
a bright, upbeat personality as the phone is answered.
BUD
Dixon! It's your lucky day! That's
right. I want to give you some
stock and you don't have to put up
a penny...
INTERCUT:
A small cabin in the mountains.
BUD
No, no Dixon, my client wants to
buy a large, large block of stock
and needs to spread it around. I'll
park some money in your account and
if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm
telling you, this is the easiest
money you ever made...
Bud following Carl.
BUD
And what if you're wrong? What if
one day, the sun didn't rise in the
East and birds didn't fly South in
winter and for once in your life
your compass was off? Huh?
He grabs Carl by the arm, stopping him.
BUD (CONT'D)
Would you be willing to wreck your
men's future? My future? Please...
Dad. Think. Be practical, for a
change. I'm asking you, I'm fucking
begging you...
Bud lets go of Carl's arm. Carl looks at his son, seeing the
desperation. Sadness and confusion take hold of him.
CARL
I don't sleep with no whore and I
don't wake up with no whore. That's
how I live with myself, Buddy. I
don't know how you do.
(a beat)
I hope I'm wrong, I'll let them
decide for themselves, that much I
promise you.
He walks away. Bud watches him go, knows he has won.
Long shot of the towering stone structure. A tall angular
figure crosses through the glass doors with a bulky folder
under his arm...
Bud walks out, heading up the street, absent amid the
scurrying mid-day hordes tearing up the street for the loot
inside.
Darien approaches, carrying groceries, enters the building.
Bud's MOTHER is outside with Dominick Amato and another
neighbor just visiting, bringing candies.
BUD
(lighting a cigarette)
Mom! How is he?
MOM
(shaken)
...he was complaining about chest
pains at work. Next thing I know he
collapsed... Oh Buddy, talk to him,
he's so stubborn.
AMATO
(to Bud)
...don't worry, he's got another 20
years in him. He's a tough ol' nut,
your Dad...
They walk the sunny streets, a jubilant Gekko, savoring his
triumph, grabs Darien's arm.
GEKKO
What do you say we go get a suite
at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne?
Celebrate, just like the old times
Sunshine.
DARIEN
(indignantly)
Those days are over, Gordon. They
were over a long time ago.
GEKKO
(condescendingly but
paying little
attention to the rebuff)
Can't blame me for trying. You look
as beautiful as that painting I
just bought.
He pats her on the back in a preprietary fashion.
GEKKO (CONT'D)
(mockingly)
So what's the problem Sunshine? You
look like Black Thursday. Bad case
of puppy love?
DARIEN
(indignant)
It's not puppy love, Gordon.
Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
GEKKO
(off handed)
Sorry to hear that. I thought the
kid had staying power.
DARIEN
It's over you, Gordon.
GEKKO
(cooly)
You told him about us?
DARIEN
No, are you crazy? And I don't want
him ever to know. Do you
understand?...
She moves closed and takes Gordon's hand.
DARIEN (CONT'D)
I want to ask you a big favor,
Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
GEKKO
(stroking her face)
Now tell me, why would I want to do
that?
DARIEN
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
GEKKO
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had
a little talk. We came to an
understanding.
(takes her hand paternally)
I want you to go back to him.
Soothe him. Help keep his head
straight. Okay?
DARIEN
I can't...and I won't.
GEKKO
Come on, we both like Buddy. But
this bleeding heart puppy love act
is over the top... It doesn't fit.
DARIEN
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me
Gordon.
GEKKO
You and I are the same, Darien.
We're smart enough not to buy into
the oldest myth running: love... A
fiction created by people who got
nothing to keep them from jumping
out of windows.
DARIEN
You're really twisted, Gordon.
You're incapable of giving to
anybody because deep down inside
you there's a poverty that every
last dollar in the world won't fill.
GEKKO
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared
little girl all wrapped in a pretty
grown-up package. Does this mean
you're ready to cut the umbilical
cord and step out into the world on
your own? Because, Darien, if
you're through with me, you're
through with everything I'm a part of.
Darien's eyes cloud over...the look of a scared child being
banished by her father. Then...
DARIEN
I know...but maybe, just maybe
Gordon, I'm good enough so I don't
need you anymore.
She walks away.
Wildman is off the Long Island Sound waters in his boat
lighting a cigar. Two beautiful women and an aide are with him.
WILDMAN
Well then... guess I'll have to
carry him a few rounds before he
drops.
Switches lines, checking his quotron...
WILDMAN
Bluestar. Don't make a big deal.
Buy it lightly on the way down.
(emphatically)
When it hits 18--buy it all.
People rushing to work. Bud crosses the street, his face
buried in The Financial Times. Insert: "SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN
MOUNTS BLUESTAR BUY WITH UNION SUPPORT".
Satisfied, Bud folds the paper and heads into his office
building.
Long shot. Activity is winding down, a few sunbathers
collecting their blankets. A solitary figure stands on a
hill silhouetted by the sunset. A second figure appears on a
footpath and starts climbing the hill towards the other man.
Gekko waits, expressionless... Bud approaches him. They
stand facing each other.
GEKKO
Hello Bud.
BUD
Gordon.
GEKKO
You sandbagged me on Bluestar.
(smiles)
I guess you think you taught the
teacher a lesson, that you can make
the tail wag the dog, huh?
Bud looks away. Gekko's smile fades.
GEKKO (CONT'D)
Well let me cue you in: the ice is
melting under your feet sport...
Without warning, he grabs Buddy roughly by the lapels and
lets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps
across his face.
GEKKO (CONT'D)
You think you could've gotten this
far this fast with anybody else?
You think you could be out there
dicking somebody like Darien? No,
you'd be cold calling dentists and
widows to buy twenty shares of some
dog stock! I took you in! A nobody!
I opened doors for you!...I showed
you how the system works!...
Gekko slapping him harder and harder, Buddy staggering with
the blows, saying nothing, not defending himself.
GEKKO (CONT'D)
...the value of information! How
you get it! Anacott Steel, Brant
Resources, Transuniversal, Fulham
Oil. And this is how you pay back,
you cockroach! I gave you Darien, I
gave you your manhood. I gave you
everything.
He backhands Bud across the face. Bud lies on the ground,
spent, as is Gordon breathing hard. Bud gets to his knees,
blood streaming from his nose, his suit muddied. Passersby
look on, wondering.
Gekko seems to relent, the rage going into hurt, remorse. He
hands Bud a handkerchief. Bud staunches the flow of blood
from his nose.
GEKKO (CONT'D)
(softly, innocently)
You could've been one of the great
ones Bud...I look at you and see
myself...Why?
Bud looks at Gordon, torn by mixed emotions: the bonds they
share and the betrayal wrought.
BUD
(shakes his head, thoughtfully)
I don't know. My Dad once told me,
"money is something you need in
case you don't die tomortow." I
guess I realized I'm just Bud Fox.
And as much as I wanted to be
Gordon Gekko--I'll always be Bud Fox.
He looks at Gordon, as if wanting to say more, but doesn't.
In long shot, Gordon stands alone as Bud walks away.
The DOORMAN looks askance. Bud, mud-splattered suit and
bloody nose, walks straight past him thru the door.
Bud getting out...crossing to Darien. A pause.
DARIEN
(nervous)
Hi.
BUD
Why?
DARIEN
I figure a guy who's made some
mistakes should be able to
understand a girl who's made some
of her own...
Bud looking at her, moves closer, longing and hope and
happiness have returned to his dull eyes... and forgiveness,
the greatest of all.
They embrace. Bud will never know about her past, nor need
he. The camera leaving them on a slanting, circular crane,
lifting past the Federal Building to a panorama of Wall
Street in all its icy magisterial splendor...and thus ends
our tale.
