      JANE, CHO and LISBON in the shorter, cops-only security line, 
      suffering the usual pre-coffee office boredom.  A looooong 
      beat... Jane points to a Woman in a red dress in the civilian 
      line --

                                  JANE
                    Red dress.  Go.  Guess.

      A game they play sometimes.  Cho eyes the Woman carefully --

                                  CHO
                    She s... allergic to perfume?  
                          (off them; defensive)
                    It s a good guess.  She just 
                    sneezed.

                                  JANE
                    She s having an affair.  Next?

                                  LISBON
                    Hang on.  An affair?  You just made 
                    that up.

      Jane points to others in line in quick succession --

                                  JANE
                    Hiding a terminal illness, about to 
                    propose to her girlfriend, and... 
                    about to quit his job.  That or 
                    kill his boss.

                                  LISBON

                                  JANE
                    Not at all.  You see, the woman in 
                    the red dress has a peculiar --

      But we ll never know how Jane knew, because just then --

      ANGLE - NEAR THE BIG GLASS DOORS

      Carl Resnick pushes through the entrance doors, still 
      dragging something, making a ruckus, still determinedly 
      muttering self-help jargon --  

                                  CARL
                    My attitude toward life determines 
                    life s attitude toward me, got a 
                    job to do, ya gotta do it right...

      Whatever he s dragging gets stuck as the doors close.  He has 
      to yank it free.  Thunk, thunk.  

                                  LISBON (O.S.)
                    Stop!

                    Let me see your hands, NOW.

      There s a trail of smeared BLOOD behind Carl.  Leading up to 
      the thing he s dragging:  a knotted-up blanket with something 
      heavy in it.  An ARM has popped out.  It s a YOUNG WOMAN, 
      gunshot wound.  Carl blinks.  And oddly, laughs.

                                  CARL
                    Whoa!  Make a federal case out of

      RIGSBY and VAN PELT quietly enter, guns drawn --

      To join Lisbon, Cho, and the other agents, their guns still 
      trained on Carl.  He holds the blanket end in one hand and 
      the other is suspiciously thrust in a pocket.  Jane watches, 
      intrigued, as the situation escalates --

                    your hands above your head.

      A calm voice, controlled.  Lisbon inches forward, her eyes 
      never leaving Carl s hand in his pocket.  Carl is miffed.

                                  CARL

                    will not be walked all over!

      Carl takes a step forward, Lisbon has no choice but to fire --

      And Jane steps toward Carl.  From this angle, he s blocking 
      everyone s shot.

                    Hey.  Look over there.

      Carl looks where Jane points and Jane takes Carl s wrist.  
      Carl absently drops the blanket.

                    Jane, you need to move away.

      Jane eyes the woman s body, then Carl, puzzled.

                                  JANE

                    Near enough. 

      Jane waves his hand in front of Carl s face twice, quickly, 
      studying how his pupils react.

      FADE IN:


      Rigsby and Jane watch Cho and Carl in INTERROGATION.

                                  RIGSBY
                    The man s lying.

                    Given that the girl he dragged in 
                    here dead is not actually a bag of 
                    spuds like he says, yes.

                    It s not a lie if he believes it.


      Carl is trying his best to help Cho.

                                  CHO
                    So, Carl.  Why would you bring a 
                    bag of potatoes to the police?

      Carl pauses.  He can t remember.  An embarrassed grin --

                                  CHO
                    Carl, what if I told you it wasn t

                    dead girl you were dragging around.

      Carl seems genuinely horrified. 

                                  CARL
                    You have a twisted sense of humor.

                                  CHO
                    Here s proof, Carl.  What do you 
                    see here?

      Cho throws down a PHOTO:  the dead Woman on the Lobby floor, 
      still in the blanket.  Carl is bewildered, seeing only --

      Rigsby and Jane.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    He s crazy.

                                  JANE
                      Hypnotized.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Come on.

      And Lisbon enters as --

                                  JANE
                    Hypnosis is just a way to connect 
                    to the imagination rather than the 
                    conscious mind.  The mind will 
                    accept whatever the imagination 
                    creates, however bizarre.

                                  LISBON
                    Hypnosis is what you use -- against 
                    my explicit orders -- to get 
                    witnesses to tell the truth.  
                    That s a little different from 
                    getting someone to see a dead girl 
                    as a sack of vegetables.

                    But he doesn t look like he s in a 
                    trance or anything.

                                  JANE
                    Neither did Minelli, when I 
                      hypnotized him to stop smoking.  
                    A subject acts normally, except 
                    inside the suggestion.  Carl s 
                      suggestion was to have this very 
                    powerful hallucination.  And to 
                    forget who did it.  Whoever did 
                    this is very good, I must admit.

                                  LISBON
                    Good enough to hypnotize Carl into 
                    killing the girl?

      Jane is thoughtful.  

                                  JANE
                    Depends on whether Carl, deep down, 
                    wanted to kill the girl.  

                                  LISBON
                    But if he s hypnotized --

                                  JANE
                    -- No suggestion in the world can 
                    make you do something against your 
                    moral character, against your true 
                    will.  A hypnotized saint is still 
                    a saint.

                                  LISBON
                    So if Carl s a killer, he can be 
                      hypnotized to kill.  Otherwise...

                                  RIGSBY
                    Otherwise the hypnotist must have 
                    killed the girl and framed Carl for 
                    it.

      Lisbon peel into --

                    So, is Carl a killer?  What do we 
                    know about him?

      Before Van Pelt can speak --

                                  JANE
                    I could try, but without knowing 
                    the trigger it would be like 
                    playing Marco Polo in the Atlantic.

      puts his arm around the Older Man as they face the audience.

                    I d love a quick word in private if 
                    I may. 

      Daniel plays to the audience.

                                  DANIEL
                    I m kind of in the middle of 
                    something here.

      The audience thinks this is more of the routine and laughs.

                                  JANE 
                    It s important.  Your boat is on 
                    fire.

                                  DANIEL
                    My boat?  I don t have a boat.

                                  JANE
                    No, not any more.

      Daniel looks to RICK TIEGLER, 20 s, slick, in the front row.

                                  DANIEL 
                    Rick, page security, would you?
                          (tough, to Jane)
                    Sir, I don t know what your issue 
                    is but --

      Looking daggers at Jane, Lisbon moves him aside to show her 
      badge to Daniel.

                                  LISBON
                    Sir...

      Jane throws up his hands.

                                  JANE
                    All right, all right.  I was trying 
                    to avoid upsetting everybody.  Your 
                    assistant Mary Beth has been 
                    murdered. 

      Daniel looks stunned.  The audience gasps and murmurs.  
      Lisbon comes to the front and shows her badge.

                          (to audience)
                    I know you ll understand and excuse 
                    me, folks.  The very able and 
                    eloquent Rick Tiegler will conduct 
                    this seminar from here on in.  Hope 
                    to see you all again soon. 

      Daniel hands the mike to Rick, who is flustered, but recovers 
      fast.  Bounds up onstage as Daniel gets down offstage and 
      follows Jane and Lisbon out of the auditorium.

                                  RICK
                          (to audience)
                    Wow.  Well, as Dr. Daniel showed 
                    you, trance is incredibly powerful.  
                    And we re going to teach you how to 
                    unleash that power for yourselves.  

      The audience rustles with interest. 

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    Let s start by relaxing with a few 
                    simple breathing exercises, then 
                    I ll show you how to supercharge 
                    your life.  How s that sound?

      The audience thinks that sounds good.


      Jane, Lisbon and Daniel emerge from the auditorium and join 
      Carl and Rigsby.  Daniel shows no recognition of Carl.  

                                  CARL
                          (sheepish)
                    Hi, Dr. Daniel.

                                  JANE
                    Carl?  Is this who hypnotized you?  
                    Let s see your eyes...

      Jane pushes Carl so he s almost nose to nose with Daniel.

                                  DANIEL
                          (backs away)

                    Mmmm, the face is familiar.  Is he 
                    one my students?

      Jane looks at Carl, then Daniel, discerns no hypnotic 
      connection. 

                                  JANE 
                    Hmm, well.  Nope.  Rigs, why don t 
                    you and Carl go to the seminar 
                    while we speak with Dr. Daniel?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Boss?

                                  LISBON
                    I ll stick with Carl.
                          (off Jane)
                    That way I ll know he won t get 
                    lost or broken.


      Opulent but tasteful.  Dr. Daniel with Rigsby and Jane.  
      Daniel is trying to hide his upset.

                                  DANIEL
                    This is terrible.  Poor kid.  I had 
                    a bad feeling -- when I couldn t 
                    reach her last night.  Not like her 
                    to disappear.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    She have problems with anyone 
                    lately?  Bad breakup, anyone who 
                    might want to hurt her?

                                  DANIEL
                          (shrugs)
                      I wouldn t know.  Mary Beth s  
                    personal life was her own.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    She was brought to us by Carl 
                    Resnick out there.  He was 
                      hypnotized to think she was a big 
                    old bag of potatoes.  

      Daniel is impressed.

                                  DANIEL
                    Strong stuff.

                                  DANIEL
                    Oh, very few people have the talent 
                    to create a trance that powerful.  
                    Very few.

                                  JANE
                    Besides you, of course.  What were 
                    you doing last night between 
                    midnight and six?

                                  DANIEL
                    Oh, wait now.  You don t think I 
                    killed Mary Beth?

                    Well.  Maybe I need a lawyer here.

                    Maybe.  I wouldn t know.  Rigsby?  
                    He need a lawyer?

      A standoff, two alphas locking horns.  Rigsby breaks through 
      the tension.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Dr. Daniel, how about you tell me 
                    about your students.  What kind of 
                    people want to get  what they want 
                    from whoever they want ?

                                  DANIEL
                    Who doesn t want to make his life 
                    better?  Using trance as a tool, 
                    NLP can help everyone from

                    them.  Nothing wrong with that, 
                    right?

      This last directed at Jane with a cheerful fuck-you smile. 

                                    LINDSAY
                    Royston, I have those files you 
                    needed -- the advance work for the 
                    seminar in San Francisco.  

      Lindsay Hendrix is at the door.  Daniel is surprised.

                                  DANIEL
                    Lindsay?  You came in?

                                    LINDSAY
                    I had to keep busy, you know, I... 
                    I had to.

      Lindsay forces a smile, but the vulnerability shows.  Daniel 
      takes the file.  

                                  DANIEL
                    Thanks.  But you don t belong here, 
                    Lindsay.  Not today.  Whatever it 
                    is can wait.  It s not important.

                                    LINDSAY
                    What?

      She seems a little lost.  Daniel uses a gentle tone to mask 
      the harsh words.

                                  DANIEL 
                    I am otherwise occupied, as you can 
                    see.  Go home.  Grieve.  We ll 
                    survive, don t worry.  Take care of 
                    you.

      A beat.  Lindsay s emotional, embarrassed.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Sorry... Sorry... You re right, 
                    this was a bad idea... Sorry...

      Lindsay exits, tearful.  Jane is admiring.

                                  JANE
                     Take care of you.   That s the 
                    smoothest blow-off I ve ever heard.  
                    You really are good.

      And he exits with a smile, leaving Rigsby alone with Daniel.


      Lisbon and Carl seated in the back of the auditorium 
      listening to Rick Tiegler in mid spiel.  Carl is watching 
      Tiegler like a hawk, but then so is Lisbon...

                                  RICK
                    Are you feeling it?  Are you all 
                    feeling it?

      All in the audience say or at least murmur  YES.   Lisbon 
      almost does, but stops herself.  

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    Good, good.  Now I m going to talk 
                    to you individually, and invite one 
                    or two of you to come and help me 
                    up onstage.  Will you do that?  
                    Will you help me if I ask you? 

      Again all in the audience say  Yes.  

      Rick gets down off the stage and prowls up the aisle, looking 
      for good soft targets.  He starts in a alarm when he sees 
      Carl in back.

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    Wh -- why are you --?

                                  CARL
                    What do you want me to do here?

      Too late, Tiegler realizes that the woman next to Carl is a 
      cop.  Lisbon eyes Carl, sees his mesmerized expression, looks 
      back to Tiegler, suspicion in her eyes...

                                  RICK

                    Oh, sorry, I thought you were

      Tiegler tries to move on...

                    Kinda busy right now.

      Lisbon stands up.  Tiegler runs to the door.  Lisbon quickly 
      cuffs Carl s handcuffs to his chair and sprints after 
      Tiegler.

                                  LISBON
                    Stop!


      BOOM!  Lisbon and Tiegler come tumbling through the 
      auditorium doors, pound toward the grand stairway.  Like an 
      expert calf roper, Lisbon swiftly subdues Tiegler --

      Just as Jane comes down the stairs.

                                  JANE 
                    You didn t like the class?

                    I think we found our mystery 
                      hypnotist.

      She handcuffs Tiegler (with a second set of handcuffs).    
      Jane smiles at Tiegler on the ground...

                                  JANE
                    What do you know, I got what I want 
                    from who I want.  This NLP stuff 
                    really works.

      Off his smile --

      Cho interrogating Rick.  Rick s agitated, a little twitchy.

                                  RICK
                    I m not talking about Carl.        
                    I don t know anything about him. 

                                  CHO
                    Okay.  Let s talk about your job.   
                    You re pretty good at what you do I 
                    guess.

                                  RICK
                    I try.

                                  CHO
                    Agent Rigsby asked around at the 
                    center.  Everyone says you re Dr. 
                    Daniel s number one guy.    

      Rick can t help puffing a bit with pride.

                                  RICK 
                    I m proud to assist Dr. Daniel in 
                    his work.  And yes, I m good at 
                    what I do.  That s what the model 
                    life is all about.

                                  CHO
                    If anyone could put the hex on Carl 
                    Resnick, it s you.

                                  RICK
                      I wouldn t say that.  Nope.  

                                  CHO 
                    You ever try your stuff on Mary 
                    Beth Hendrix?

                                  RICK
                    I don t want to talk about her 
                    either.

      Cho eyes Rick carefully.  Then Rick s hands.  A little shaky.

                                  CHO
                    Are you a drinker, Rick?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       24.
      CONTINUED:1919

                                  RICK
                    No.  I mean, I like a drink.

                                  CHO
                    Would you like one now?  

                                  RICK
                    You offering?

                                  CHO
                    No.

      Beat.

                                  RICK
                    I m not a drunk.  I ve been under a 
                    lot of stress.

                                  CHO 
                      I understand.  Were you drunk when 
                    you killed Mary Beth?  

                                  RICK
                    I didn t.

                                  CHO
                    That s right, you didn t.  But if 
                    something happened when you were 
                    drunk, that means you had 
                      diminished capacity.  It means 
                    you re not responsible like you 
                    would normally be.    

                                  RICK 
                    Yeah?...  Yeah, I know that.

                                  CHO
                    Well.  Is that how it was?  

      A long beat.  Rick squirms.

                                  RICK
                    Maybe.  I really don t know.

                                  CHO
                    Tell me what happened.

                                  RICK
                    I was mad at Mary Beth.  Yesterday 
                    I d kind of... asked her out, and 
                    she said no.  She said no way, 
                    actually.  In hell.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       25.
      CONTINUED: (2)1919

                                  CHO
                    So last night you were mad, maybe 
                    you went to a bar to forget?

                                  RICK
                    Yeah, I hoisted a few.  Dozen.  A 
                    man s gotta blow off steam, you 
                    know?  I know I lasted till like 
                    one, but then I guess I blacked 
                    out.  

      FLASHBACK


      QUICK FLASHES:  Mary Beth s BODY on the floor, the GUN in 
      someone s hand, a pool of BLOOD...

                                  RICK (V.O.)
                          (hard to say it)
                    When I woke up... It was five a.m. 
                    and I was in Mary Beth s living 
                    room.  Standing over her body.  A 
                    gun in my hand, I could smell the 
                    powder.  I was just standing there, 
                    calm as could be.

      And now the whole picture:  RICK with the gun, horrified as 
      he looks down at Mary Beth...

      END FLASHBACK


                                  CHO
                    So you killed her.

                                  RICK
                    I... I guess I did.  I don t know.  
                    But like you said, I m not 
                      responsible!  

                                  CHO
                    And after you killed her.  That s 
                    when you decided to use your skills 
                    to frame Carl Resnick?

                                  RICK
                    We d been partners in a trance 
                    exercise.  I d already put him 
                    under a few times.  It s easier 
                    after that.  Especially on Carl.  
                    Such a creampuff.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       26.

                                  CHO
                    What did you think was going to 
                    happen, when Carl dragged a 
                    murdered girl s body to the cops 
                    with a gun in his hand?  Did you 
                    think Carl was walking out of there 
                    alive?

                                  RICK
                          (sheepish)
                      Weeeeellll...

      Cho stands.

                                  CHO
                    Rick, we re charging you with the 
                    murder of Mary Beth Hendrix.  Stay put.  

      OMITTEDA22A22 *


      Late afternoon shadows.  At the big table, Rigsby and Carl 
      sit near each other.  Lisbon pops her head in just as a  *
      Teacher exits.  Rigsby s just scribbling a final note -- *

                                  RIGSBY
                    Be with you in a sec...
                          (seeing her)
                    Oh, hey, Boss.  Has Cho searched  *
                    Tiegler s place yet? *

      Lisbon plops into the seat next to Rigsby.  (NOTE:  During 
      the following, Rigsby will be mirroring Lisbon s movements -- 
      the way she sits, crosses her legs, touches her face, etc.)

                                  LISBON
                    He s getting the warrant.  I m all  *
                    done with the student interviews --  *
                    how s it going here? *

      She crosses her legs.  Rigsby follows suit.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Couple more teachers to go.  So 
                    far, nobody knows much about 
                    Tiegler or Mary Beth.

                                  CARL
                    I can t believe Rick killed Mary 
                    Beth.

                    Do you think Dr. Daniel will set up 
                    a place to make donations in her 
                    name?  A charity for a school would 
                    be good.

                    of what these guys say.  

      Lisbon leans forward to look at Rigsby s notes.  Rigsby leans 
      forward, too.  Odd.  Lisbon clocks it.

                                  LISBON
                    What are you doing?

                    What?  Nothing.

      She sits back.  Rigsby sits back.

                                  LISBON
                    Are you... mimicking me?

                    It s called  modeling.   You kind

      Carl smiles, and as we ll remember later, snaps his fingers 
    and points at Rigsby.

                                  CARL
                    You will.

      And he exits.  Another Teacher enters and Rigsby starts the

      Lisbon and Van Pelt take a slice.  Jane refuses, troubled by

      Rigsby approaches (we see Carl exit in the b.g.) --

                    He got drunk, he blacked out, killed

                                  JANE
                    Tiegler came out of a drunken 
                    stupor standing upright over a body 
                    instead of lying facedown in a pool 
                    of vomit?  Almost sounds more like 
                    a trance than a blackout.

                                  CHO

                    I didn t eat all this cheese and 
                    grease for nothing.  The case is

                    You re too suggestible.

      But Lisbon hears him, gives him a hard look.  Just then 
      Lindsay Hendrix enters, timid.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Um, hi, Agent Lisbon.  I m here for my 
                    sister s effects, from our apartment?

                    Sure.  Agent Rigsby will help you. 

      Rigsby, about to take a huge bite of pizza, puts it down, 
      gravely disappointed.  Lindsay turns to go with Rigsby.  Jane 
      calls after her.

                                  JANE
                    Ms. Hendrix.  A question: do you believe 
                    Rick Tiegler killed your sister?

                                  LISBON
                    Jane.

      But Lindsay turns, puzzlement and relief mixed.

                                    LINDSAY
                      Actually... I kind of don t.  I was 
                    going to talk to you about it. 
                    How did you know?

      Lisbon doesn t want Jane to have quite such a swift victory.  
      She steers Lindsay away --

      Jane enters.

                    It s just nagging at me, I m sorry.  
                    Did Rick say how he got into our

                    It s just... Mary Beth really 
                    disliked him.  Like really.  I 
                    can t imagine she d let him into 
                    our place.  

      Lisbon slides a file toward Rigsby.

                    Well, there s no way he broke in.

                    Beth got really security-conscious 
                    after she and Royston got mugged.

                                  RIGSBY
                    She and Dr. Daniel?

                    the weekend, some kids there mugged 
                    them.  It was awful.

                                  RIGSBY
                    She and Dr. Daniel were a couple.

                                    LINDSAY

      Lisbon sighs.  


      Rigsby, Jane and Lisbon confer quietly.  We can see Lindsay 
      in Lisbon s office, waiting patiently.

                                  RIGSBY 
                    Daniel told us Mary Beth was just 
                    his assistant, he didn t know 
                    anything about her personal life.

                                  LISBON

                    It s probably nothing.  But it is a

                    you?  Weren t you?  Tell the truth, 
                    Royston.  Tell me.

      Cho rushes to Rigsby as Jane, Van Pelt and Lisbon rush in.

                                  DANIEL
                    All right!  All right!  We were 
                    together!  We d been dating since 
                      September.  Okay?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       33.

      Cho and Lisbon wrestle Rigsby away.  But he offers no 
      resistance.  A satisfied grin on his face.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Now that feels better, doesn t it?

      Van Pelt stares at the nonchalant Rigsby, horrified.  Daniel 
      grips his bloody nose, moaning.  

                                  DANIEL
                    You broke my nose!  You crazy 
                      bastard!...

      Jane eyes Rigsby s face as Lisbon hisses in Rigsby s ear --

                                  LISBON
                    Agent Rigsby, step outside.  


      Jane, Lisbon, Van Pelt with Rigsby.  (Cho is Interrogation 
      with Daniel.)  Jane studies Rigsby as --

                                  LISBON
                    Your gun and your badge.

                    Boss, come on...

                                  LISBON
                    Now.

      Rigsby hands over his gun and badge to Lisbon.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Do you get what you ve just done?  
                    Damnit, Wayne.  

                                  JANE
                    Oh, dear.

                          (Duh, Rigsby hit a guy)
                    I know!

                                  JANE
                    No.  This.

      Jane waves his hand in front of the Rigsby, just as he did 
      with Carl in Act One.  Lisbon remembers it, too.

                                  LISBON
                    No.  No way.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      The gang follows Rigsby toward his desk.  Rigsby is skeptical 
      but mightily amused.  (Note:  he no longer has a sidearm.)

                                  RIGSBY
                    Oh, I ve been hypnotized, have I?  
                    Are you going to make me do 
                      embarrassing things?  Pretend I m 
                    Tina Turner or something?

                                  JANE
                    Would you like to be Tina Turner?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Jane, trust me.  I m not 
                      hypnotized.  I feel fine.  Totally 
                    normal.

                                  CHO
                    Normally, you don t break the noses 
                    of your suspects.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (a chuckle)
                    What are you talking about?  I just 
                      questioned the man.

      Jane and a worried Lisbon step aside into the HALLWAY...

                                  LISBON
                    Could this be something 
                      psychological?  A psychotic break 
                    or something?

                                  JANE
                    No.  Hypnosis, that s all.

                                  LISBON
                    I thought you can t hypnotize 
                    someone to do something against his 
                    moral character.

                                  JANE
                    Rigsby has a brutal streak.  If you 
                    didn t know, now you know.  Not an 
                    uncommon trait in those drawn to 
                      policework.

                    I m calling a shrink, to make 
                    sure...

                                  JANE
                    I ll prove it.  Deeply hypnotized 
                    subjects have very few inhibitions. 

      Jane leads them back to the BULLPEN.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Rigs, do me favor.  Close your 
                    eyes.  Relax.  Good.  Now, don t 
                    tell me, just think about it, think 
                    about what you most want to do 
                    right now.  You can do anything you 
                    like in the whole world.  What will 
                    you do?  I want you to open your 
                    eyes and do it.  Do what you want.  

      Rigsby rises from his chair, goes to Van Pelt, takes her in 
      his arms, and gives her the longest and sexiest kiss in the 
      history of CBS television.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Okay, then.

                                  CHO
                    Huh.

      Lisbon shakes her head.  Rigsby and Van Pelt come up for air.  
      Van Pelt is upset, embarrassed and aroused all at once, and 
      takes a beat before wrenching herself away.  

                                  LISBON
                    Okay, he s hypnotized.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Well, unhypnotize him.

                                  JANE
                    Are you sure?  

      Van Pelt punches Jane on the shoulder.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Do it.

                                  JANE 
                    I can t.  The hypnotist used a 
                    specific trigger to induce trance.  
                    Without knowing it, I can t bring 
                    him out.

      He shoves Cho aside.

                    Hey!

                    real killer and just thought he

                                  CHO

      Off Lisbon, not liking the sound of that at all --


      Dark, empty, spooky.  The doors open... It s Rigsby.  Looking 
      for someone...


      Dr. Daniel (black eye, bandaged nose) sits behinds his desk.  
      Rigsby enters.  (Note:  Rigsby seems normal in tone and

      Lindsay Hendrix steps from the corner, her gun trained on 
      Daniel.  Now we see Daniel is handcuffed to the chair.  
      Lindsay s tone to Rigsby is gentle, vulnerable (and she s 
      using it to reinforce Rigsby s trance).

                                    LINDSAY
                    Royston wouldn t hurt Mary Beth, if 
                    that s what you re thinking.  Not 
                    in a million years.  He loved her.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       44.

                                  RIGSBY
                    This is just routine.  Relax, we ll 
                    be done in no time.

      CLOSE ON:  Lindsay s hand as it touches Rigsby s shoulder 
      once, quickly.  (This is the trigger.)  Then she leaves her 
      hand on his arm.  Establishing rapport.  Matching Rigsby s 
      breathing, his blinking...

                                    LINDSAY
                    I will, I ll relax.  I feel safe 
                    with you, Wayne.  Very safe.

      HER EYES seem kind.  Rigsby has to lean close to hear her low 
      voice.  Her voice is alive with inflection now --

                                    LINDSAY (CONT D)
                    I feel safe and relaxed, very 
                    relaxed sitting here, and I feel I 
                    can tell you anything, anything at 
                    all.  Let me tell you about Dr. 
                    Daniel...

      Lindsay takes his other hand in hers.  Rigsby doesn t resist.  
      Off him --

                                    LINDSAY
                    Don t worry, everything will be 
                    fine now. 

                                  DANIEL
                    Agent Rigsby.  Agent, I want you to 
                    relax and listen to the sound of my 
                    voice.  Listen to me, for God s 
                    sake!

      Lindsay frowns...

      ANGLE ON DR. DANIEL - SECONDS LATER

      A RIIIIIIP! SOUND and then a piece of duct tape is plastered 
      over his mouth.

      Rigsby and Cho walk away from their desks.  Rigsby s modest 
      but pleased.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    ...I don t know, I just suddenly 
                    came out of it.  I knew I had to 
                    take her down.  Bam. 

      They go to...


      At a table, Jane is enjoying some tea.  Lisbon is fixing her 
      fourth coffee.  Van Pelt is burrowing in the fridge when 
      Rigsby and Cho enter.  

                                  CHO
                    Yes, you  took down  a 100-pound 
                    woman, but in that context, you did 
                    good. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    What d you mean, in that context?

                                  LISBON
                    Oh, in the context of someone who 
                    let himself get hypnotized and 
                    nearly threw his colleague off a 
                    building, and finally managed to 
                    overpower a small crazy woman to 
                    retrieve the situation, you did 
                    good.  

      She smiles to take the sting out of it.  Rigsby knows he s 
      owed a ribbing, so he s good-natured about it.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       52.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Be fair, a small crazy woman with a 
                    gun.  A gun is a gun.   

                                  JANE
                    And anyone can be hypnotized.  And 
                    she was extremely good.  Better 
                    than, well no, not better than me, 
                    but close.  Close-ish.

                                  LISBON
                          (hands Rigsby his gun)
                    Which is why the Professional 
                    Standards Unit cleared you for 
                      assaulting Dr. Daniel.  You weren t 
                    yourself.  
                          (to Jane)
                    But he is now, right?  Himself?  
                      Completely unprogrammed.

                                  JANE
                    Yes, he is. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Last two days are gone, but other 
                    than that I m good to go...

                                  VAN PELT
                    Oh.  So you don t remember anything 
                    from when you were hypnotized?

                                  RIGSBY
                    You know, fragments, but not 
                    really.  Thank goodness, right?  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Yeah.

      Mixed emotions in the  yeah.   Rigsby laughs, not noticing.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Oh lord, did I make a fool of 
                    myself?  Cluck like a chicken?
                          (beat)
                    I didn t do Tina Turner, did I?

      Lisbon and Jane exchange a look with Cho.  Van Pelt gives 
      them a warning glare.

                                  VAN PELT
                    No.  You were perfectly normal.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Well, good.  That s a relief.

      She moves off.  Rigsby studiously avoids watching her go.  

                                  JANE
                    Coward.

                                  RIGSBY 
                    What?

                                  JANE
                    You really don t remember?

                                  RIGSBY
                    What don t I remember?

                                  CHO
                    He remembers.  

      Cho exits.  Lisbon follows.

                                  LISBON
                    You so remember.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Remember what?

      Jane rests a hand on his shoulder.  

                                  JANE
                    It ll come to you.

      Jane exits.  Off Rigsby --

                                                                          FADE OUT.
