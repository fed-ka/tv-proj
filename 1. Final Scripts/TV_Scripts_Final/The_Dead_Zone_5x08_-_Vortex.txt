  11OVER BLACK WE HEAR A MAN'S VOICE:

                                        CARTER'S VOICE
                        And they went up on the breadth
                        of the earth, and compassed the
                        camp of the saints about, and the
                        beloved city: and fire came down
                        from God out of heaven... and
                          devoured them.

          And with those last words... WHOOSH!!!


22A WALL OF FIRE BILLOWS OUT AT US IN SLOW MOTION

          It's like watching the head of a match ignite in extreme
            close-up.  Times a thousand.

          Hungry tongues of flame devour the screen, their hurricane-
          like howls interspersed with demonic cracklings and
            hissings.  A vision of the Apocalypse?  For a moment, it
          seems that way, but then...

          ...THE FLAMES BECOME PIXILATED and we begin to pull back,
            revealing what they're feeding on:  several wooden
          structures, farm buildings that have been converted into
          some kind of residential compound. 

          Smoke rises into the sky as our frame widens to include a
          TIME CODE.  Suddenly, the image FREEZES, and we RACK FOCUS
          to a MAN'S HAND holding a REMOTE, his thumb on "pause." 

          The hand belongs to MAJOR RAY SEYBOLD, a uniformed, no-
          nonsense State Police supervisor in his 40s.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        At this point, the structures
                        were fully involved.  We --

                                        STILLSON (O.S.)
                                  (condescending)
                        "Fully involved?"

          REVEAL we're:

    3CONTINUED:3

          members of an INVESTIGATING PANEL.  A SEAL on the wall
          identifies the "Maine State Commission of Investigation." 
          Seybold testifies from a table near a wide-screen monitor,
          as a COURT REPORTER and a smattering of OFFICIALS listen.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        It means the entire compound was
                        completely on fire.

                                        STILLSON
                        So rescue efforts...?

                                        SEYBOLD
                        ...were impossible.  I didn't
                        want to risk more lives.

          Stillson eyes the time code.

                                        STILLSON
                        All this within twenty minutes. 
                        Major, how do you account for the
                        rapid spread of the fire?

                                        SEYBOLD
                        Incendiary devices.  If you'd
                        like to hear from the head of our
                          forensics team, he's right over --

                                        STILLSON
                        No.  Right now, I want to hear
                        from the man responsible for this
                          disaster.
                                (beat)
                        This panel calls Johnny Smith.

          ON THE DOORS as they open and Johnny is ushered inside. 
          Off Johnny, as he takes in the scene...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  44EXT. AUGUSTA, MAINE - STATE CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY
          (STOCK)

                                        STILLSON (V.O.)
                        Madame Chairman, for the record I
                        would like to state my belief
                        that these hearings should be
                        open to the press.


  55INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

          Stillson may be addressing the panel, but his eyes remain
          on Johnny, and they betray a personal animus.

                                        STILLSON
                        The citizens of Maine don't deserve
                        to be kept in the dark about the
                          progress of this investigation.

          The 50ish CHAIRWOMAN, State Senator MEGAN CLEARY, nods,
          her tone diplomatic.

                                        CHAIRWOMAN
                        Nor will they be, Congressman,
                        once this panel establishes all
                        the relevant facts.  And for the
                        record I would like to express my
                          gratitude that you have volunteered
                        to help us in that important task.
                                (turns to Johnny)
                        Mister Smith, will you please
                        state your full name?

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        John Robert Smith.

                                        CHAIRWOMAN
                        Your occupation?

          When Johnny hesitates, Stillson seizes the opportunity to
          retake control of the hearing, and get another dig in.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm afraid Mister Smith may find
                        that a sensitive question.

          Johnny eyes Stillson coolly; clearly, there's no love
          lost between these two.  Then, to the Chairwoman:

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was a science teacher.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/23/05 - BLUE-2  3A.


    5CONTINUED:5

                                        STILLSON
                        Why be disingenuous, Mister Smith? 
                        It's well known that you're a
                          professional psychic.

                                        JOHNNY
                          "Professional" implies I make
                        money at it.  I don't.

  5CONTINUED: (2)5

                                        STILLSON
                        This panel needs to know how you
                        became involved with the religious
                        cult known as "The Seekers."

          A beat as Johnny considers how best to explain.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had a vision.

                                        STILLSON
                        And this "vision," what did it
                        tell you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That a child was going to die.

          And as an expectant hush falls over the room, we PUSH IN
          on Johnny... begin to hear a woman's voice --

                                        WOMAN'S VOICE
                        The bomb went off right next to 
                        my son's convoy.


  66EXT. FAITH HERITAGE - DAY

            A charity fund-raiser in progress.  Volunteers, including
          Sarah, sell donated clothing from behind folding tables. 
          But right now they're just listening.  Panning across
          their rapt faces as we continue to hear --

                                        WOMAN (O.S.)
                        His face was lacerated and he
                        lost two fingers on his left hand,
                        but his body armor saved his life.

            REVEALING a 50ish WOMAN holding a mic as she speaks from
          a small portable stage.

                                        WOMAN
                        The Army wouldn't pay for that
                        armor, so our church did.  That's
                        why I'm so grateful to the Desert
                        Storm Veterans of Maine.  Maybe
                        we can save another mother's son. 
                        Thank you.

          APPLAUSE as she hands the mic off to Reverend Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        Thank you, Mrs. Londstrom.  A
                          reminder:  Faith Heritage will
                        match every dollar raised today,
                        so please, help our young men and
                        women, who are fighting the good
                        fight in a country that desperately
                        needs their help.

          During which, camera finds Johnny and Bruce sorting used
          clothing donations at a table in the back.  Bruce can't
          seem to get into the spirit of things.

                                        BRUCE
                        The "good fight."  It's more like
                          a lottery -- only the winners get
                        to go home in body bags.

          Johnny gives him a look, sensing there's more to this.  A
          beat, then Bruce sighs, admits what's been eating him.

                                        BRUCE
                        A good friend of mine from high
                        school, career soldier, just bought
                        it over there.  Suicide bomber.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.

          Bruce grabs a shirt, angrily folds it.

                                        BRUCE
                        He had no chance, man.  But I 
                        guess we're all in the same boat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We still talking about the war?

          Bruce gives him a look.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's not easy sharing your secrets,
                        John, if you know what I mean.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Armageddon.

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, Armageddon.  I mean look at
                        these people.  One foot in the
                        grave, only they don't know it. 
                        And only you can save them.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (attempting lightness)
                        Hey, don't put it all on me.

                        We're a team, remember?

          Bruce just shakes his head as Sarah approaches.

                                        SARAH
                        How we doing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're a sorting and folding
                          machine.

                                        SARAH
                        If you find any more of those
                        camouflage shirts or pants, shoot
                        'em over.  The kids are really
                          snapping them up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Camo's hot.  Got it.

          Another VOLUNTEER MOM waves to Sarah from the sales tables.

                                        SARAH
                        Back to the front line.

          Johnny sorts through a pile of clothes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Camo, camo, camo.  Nothing like a
                        teen in uniform.

          He sees a flash of camo but when he grabs it, WHOOSH!


77A VISION:  EXT. N.D. FIELD - DAY

          Johnny finds himself looking at a YOUNG BLOND GIRL, about
          thirty yards away, as she turns to look back at him.  A
          charged moment of connection as we hear the roar of O.S.
          flames.   Then the girl turns and starts to take a step --

                                        JOHNNY
                        NOO!!!  

          Suddenly the ground EXPLODES beneath the girl, clods of
          dirt and shrapnel flying toward Johnny, who shields his
          face just before they BLACK OUT the screen! 


  88RESUME ON JOHNNY

          Still holding the shirt.  He finds a name tag sewn over
          the breast pocket: "STYRON."


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/17/05 - YELLOW  7.


    8CONTINUED:8

          His gaze goes to a group of Gulf War vets hanging near
          the stage.  Bruce catches this.

                                        BRUCE
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hold the fort.

          We hang on Bruce as he watches Johnny head toward the
          vets, still clutching the shirt.

          WITH THE VETS AS JOHNNY APPROACHES

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yo, anyone here named Styron?  I
                        found a twenty in the pocket.

                                        VET
                        Throw it in the kitty, Jimmy won't
                        mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                          "Jimmy"?  I feel like I should
                        ask him first.

                                        VET
                        If you can catch him.  Lazy bastard
                        just took off.


  99EXT. FAITH HERITAGE - PARKING LOT - DAY

          Johnny runs up, scans the lot, and sees a guy in a fatigue
          jacket, JIMMY STYRON, 30s, about to get into a beat-up
          van.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yo, Jimmy!  Jimmy Styron!

          WITH STYRON as he turns, watches Johnny run up.  His eyes
          narrow suspiciously as Johnny arrives, out of breath.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: shirt)
                        Hey.  This is yours, right?

                                        STYRON
                        Yeah.  So?

          Johnny looks at him, feeling awkward.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/22/05 - WHT-2  8.


    9CONTINUED:9

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, it's just I... um... I
                        mean...

          Flustered, he gives up and just grabs Styron's arm.  He
          doesn't get a vision, but he does get a reaction.

                                        STYRON
                                (jerking away)
                        What are you?  Some kind of freak?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry, I just --

          But now Styron grabs Johnny, SLAMMING him against the
          side of the VAN.  But as he does -- FREEZE and WHOOSH!

          THE VAN SPINS AROUND 180 DEGREES, STYRON DISAPPEARS, AND
          JOHNNY FINDS HIMSELF STANDING BESIDE THE VAN IN -- 


  1010EXT. TBD LOCATION - NIGHT - VISION

            A highway underpass, desolate loading dock, or whatever
          similar location fits our board.  Styron's van is parked
            alongside a TAN PASSENGER VAN (same as in Sc. 29), Styron
          standing by the open rear door, showing a semi-automatic
          rifle to an intense-looking man (JACOB FRANKEL, 30s) --

                                        STYRON
                        Then you got your AR-15, the gold
                          standard.  Only difference between
                        this and the M-16 is mode-of-fire. 
                          Full-auto and 3-shot burst modes
                        are disabled on the civilian model.

                                        FRANKEL
                        Say you want to "enable" them? 

          Styron grins, tosses Frankel a ZIPLOCK filled with small
          gun parts and a computer-printed manual. 

                                        STYRON
                        With the right parts and
                          instructions, a six-year-old could
                        do it.

          As Frankel fingers the bag, Styron sizes him up, then
          flips a blanket off a box with military markings.

                                        STYRON
                        While you're at it, you might
                        want to check out these.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/17/05 - YELLOW  9.


    10CONTINUED:10

          Johnny peers into the box with Frankel.  It's packed with
          dull metal discs.  LAND MINES.

                                        STYRON
                        M-14 anti-personnel land mines. 
                        Guess you could say they fell off
                          a truck. 
                                (picks one up)
                        Step on one, you hear a click. 
                        Step off, you won't hear anything. 
                        The last word in home defense.

          A beat, then Frankel nods, his expression somber.

                                        FRANKEL
                        I'll take them.  All of them.

          And as Johnny reacts, he WHOOSHES out of the vision.


  1111RESUME ON JOHNNY, PINNED AGAINST THE VAN

          Only now he grabs Styron by the shoulders, spins and jams
          him up against the van, shouting --

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's in the van, Jimmy?  Machine
                        guns?  Land mines?

                                        STYRON
                                (freaked)
                        Get off me!

          Across the parking lot, Johnny sees --

          DEPUTY ROSCOE

          Getting out of a sheriff's cruiser with a box of clothes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Deputy!

          Off Roscoe, his face falling...

                                        ROSCOE (V.O.)
                        It was one of those days I wished
                        the Sheriff was around.


  1212INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

          Roscoe now at the witness table.  He fidgets with his
          collar, clearly uncomfortable.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/17/05 - YELLOW  10.

                                        STILLSON
                        Mister Smith's a loose cannon,
                        isn't he?

                                        ROSCOE
                        I wouldn't say that.  He's just
                        very...


  1313INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce pressure a harried Roscoe as they eye
          Styron in the interrogation room.

                                        ROSCOE (V.O.)
                        ... determined.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You searched his van?

                                        ROSCOE
                        We found some gun parts that might
                        be illegal.  Provided he doesn't
                          challenge our search.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So, let's get him to tell who he
                        sold the mines to.  It won't take
                        much to throw a scare in him.  He
                        already thinks I'm crazy.

          Roscoe eyes Johnny like he just might agree.  Then:

                                        ROSCOE
                        Can't we just wait 'til the Sheriff
                        gets back from his fishing trip?

                                        JOHNNY
                          A girl's life is at stake.

          As Roscoe sighs, relenting...

                                        STILLSON (V.O.)
                        So you allowed Mr. Smith to
                        intimidate the suspect?

                                        ROSCOE (V.O.)
                        I wouldn't call it intimidation.


  1414INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

          Johnny berates Styron as Roscoe hangs back nervously.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/21/05 - GOLD  11.


    14CONTINUED:14

                                        JOHNNY
                        You think that's the only thing I
                        can find out?  Ever cheat on your
                        income tax, Jimmy?  Steal weapons
                        from the Army?

          As Styron jerks away from Johnny's hand --

                                        ROSCOE (V.O.)
                        As it turned out, Mister Styron
                        was willing to cooperate.

                                        STYRON
                        His name's Jacob.  Lives in some
                          "commune" up in north county.

          Suddenly ROSCOE looks green; he wants to say something
          but can't.  Johnny doesn't notice, pressing Styron --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where in north county?


  1515EXT. RUSTIC GAS STATION/GENERAL STORE - DAY

          Situated in a picture-perfect small Maine town, which at
          the moment is overrun with anglers in crisp new fishing
          vests and spotless waders.  They cluster around their
          SUVs, gabbing and comparing equipment.

          Johnny's Range Rover pulls up at a pump, across from a
          big BUS-CONVERSION RV with dark windows.

                                        BRUCE
                        Guess the bass are really running
                        this year.

          An ANGLER who's filling up the RV touches his billed cap. 
          Johnny nods back, then hands Bruce a credit card.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Fill her up.  I'll ask for
                          directions.

          Johnny starts toward the store, passing an angler carrying
          a bag of food items.  The two men exchange nods, but then
            something makes Johnny look back --

          HIS POV - THE ANGLER

          The butt of a 9 mm pistol sticks out the back of his pants,
          partly hidden by the bottom of his fly fishing vest.

          JOHNNY reacts to this, puzzled and slightly disturbed.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/17/05 - YELLOW  12.

          He looks at all the anglers again, including one who's
          cleaning the windshield of a nearby SUV.  Johnny starts
          back toward his own car, "casually" allowing a hand to
          brush the back of the SUV.  WHOOSH!

          Now Johnny's really spooked.  Bruce, putting the pump
          back, notes his distraction.

                          Something's going down here and
                        it's not the bass.

          His eyes are drawn to the big RV again, now parked at the
          edge of the lot.  Instinctively, he starts toward it.

          Johnny approaches the RV, Bruce trailing him.  As they
          pass a couple of anglers, we see one of them touch his
          ear.  PUSHING IN CLOSE, we see he's wearing a small
            BLUETOOTH HEADSET.  As he listens --

          MOVING WITH JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          touch it --

          Johnny and Bruce turn just enough to see that they've
          been hemmed in by the two Fisherman, both holding guns at
            belly-level, their bodies shielding them from view.

          Johnny and Bruce turn again as the door HISSES open, then 
          react as Walt comes down the steps, wearing his uniform
          and a stony, all-business expression.

                        One thing I've learned working
                        with John:  it's hard to keep a
                        secret from him.

                                        STILLSON
                        Because he's psychic?

                        Yes.

          Stillson shakes his head derisively, as though he can't
          believe what he's hearing.

                                        STILLSON
                        And yet, with a covert raid only
                        two days away, you allowed him
                        into your command post?

                        He'd made it that far.  I thought
                        he should at least understand the

                          commune."  They farmed their land,

                        Carter thinks he's some kind of
                          prophet.  He made it onto our
                        radar a year ago, when we heard
                        he was stockpiling weapons.  About
                        a month ago, he started sending

                        over.  They talked about "doubters"

          their own welcoming committee a pudgy, mild-looking guy.

          a raised dais at one end.  Adult sect members of varying
          races and ages surround the newly arrived Australians. 
          Several CHILDREN dart among the adults, playing tag.

                        It didn't seem like a "cult," at
                        least at first.  More like a...
                        family.

                          A family.  You must have found
                        that very comforting.  Not having
                          a family of your own, I mean.

                        My point is you had reason to be
                          sympathetic to these people.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I keep an open mind.

          The pudgy guy, a 30ish Philip Seymour Hoffman type named
          ROGER, collects Bruce's cell, apologetic:

          During which, Johnny notes a group of CHILDREN sitting
          around a table drawing, supervised by a young woman (LUCY). 
          She lingers beside a BLOND GIRL who's immersed in her
          work, ignoring the more rambunctious kids around her.

          As the girl looks up, her eyes meeting Johnny's --

                        I used to work in an electronics

                          Technology's just a distraction
                        from what really matters.

          He drops the phone in a bag as Johnny fishes out his cell.

          Just "John" for now.  Lucy holds out her hand.

                          Welcome, John.

          Johnny takes her hand.  WHOOSH!  Camera 180s around him --


  4040EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT - VISION

          Johnny finds himself standing in an empty intersection. 
            Something clicks.  He looks up, sees a STOP LIGHT has
          just turned red, then turns again at the sound of OPERA
          MUSIC.  It's wafting from the open windows of an expensive
          SUV which stops near Johnny.  He steps close, peers inside.

          Lucy is in the front passenger seat; a man, evidently her
          HUSBAND, at the wheel.  The blond girl sits in back,
          fussing with a doll.  The family's dressed up, returning
          from the opera.  Lucy closes her eyes, reliving a moment
          from the performance.

                                        LUCY
                        The aria was so beautiful.  I
                        felt like I was floating.

                                        HUSBAND
                        It's that new tenor.  A year from
                        now, he'll be bigger than
                        Pavarotti.

          Suddenly both front doors are jerked open by two GUN-
          wielding CARJACKERS --

                                         CARJACKER 1
                        Get out!  Get outta the damn car!

          The little girl is frozen with fear, unnoticed by the
          carjackers as they toss her parents into the street.

                        Wait!  Our daughter! 

          He lunges toward Carjacker 1, trying to reach his daughter
          over the back of the seat.

                                        CARJACKER 1
                        Crazy mother --

                        You remind me of someone.

                        Forgive us, Mister Smith.

          Johnny and the others turn to see Carter entering with
          Frankel and two other men.  The energy in the room
          immediately ratchets up.

                                        CARTER (Cont'd)
                        We're a little behind the celebrity

                        It is Johnny Smith, isn't it?

          A murmur runs through the group.  Any hope Johnny had of
          going unrecognized is out the window.  He nods.

                          Curious, I guess.  About why I've
                        been seeing you in my visions for
                        weeks.

                        These "visions" led you here?

                        time to walk through it.

          Cyrus and the others turn to her.

                        That's what you always say.  That
                        we came together for a purpose. 
                        What if John's part of that
                          purpose?

          The others make sounds and gestures of assent.  Challenged
          with his own words, Cyrus backs down, smiles at Johnny.

                        We'll explore it together.  Welcome
                        to our home, John.

          He takes Johnny's hand.  WHOOSH!  And once again it's not
          an ordinary whoosh but the amplified sound of a flame

                        with a crystal ball...

          No laughter from the audience this time.  Stillson can't
          help but wonder if the tide is turning.

                                        STILLSON
                        ...or maybe you're just making
                        this up as you go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You subpoenaed me, Congressman. 
                        If you don't like my answers you
                        should ask different questions.

          Stillson smiles slightly at Johnny's challenging tone, as
          if he knows something Johnny doesn't.

                                        STILLSON
                        This panel's only interested in
                          establishing the facts, Mister
                        Smith.

                                        JOHNNY
                        In that case, all you need to do
                        is listen.

          STARTING TIGHT ON CARTER, his eyes closed as he finishes
            a prayer.

                                        CARTER
                        Amen.

                        Amen.

          Carter's eyes open, and we reveal he's seated at the head
          of a long communal dining table (several tables pushed
          together?).  Instant bustle as we begin tracking down the
          center-line of the table, following a heaping platter of
          fresh vegetables as they are passed down to Jacob Frankel,
          who sits beside his PREGNANT WIFE, his TODDLER SON on his
          lap.  We catch snatches of conversation --

                                        FRANKEL
                        Looks good today.

          He serves himself and his son, then passes it to a FRAGILE
          YOUNG WOMAN, who takes just a few items, then passes it
          to Roger, who's enthusiastically telling her --

                                        ROGER
                        With hydroponics, we could grow
                        more in the greenhouse than we do
                        in the fields.

          Roger serves himself, then passes it to...

          Johnny.  WHOOSH!

          Frankel, in a suit and tie, sits behind a fancy desk,
          holding a gun to his head.  Unable to pull the trigger,
          he drops his head on his desk. 

                                                                                FLASH TO:

          The fragile young woman, now looking wasted and bruised,

          of meth from a glass pipe.  As the smoke rises,

                                                                                FLASH TO:

          room surrounded by Carter, who holds a bible, and a ring
          of sect members.

                                        CARTER
                        Can you see Him, Roger?  Can you
                        see His light? 

                                        ROGER
                                (half crying)
                        Yes.  Yes!  I can! 


  4949RESUME ON JOHNNY

          Still holding the plate, he looks down the table at the
          row of beaming, content faces.  Lucy, seated beside Nora
          and across from Johnny and Bruce, notices his odd look
          and attributes it to the food.

                                        LUCY
                        Hope you two aren't die-hard
                          carnivores.

          Johnny turns to her, caught off-guard.  Bruce covers.

                                        BRUCE
                        We love our veggies.

                                        LUCY
                        John, you said your visions led
                        you here.  Are you still wondering
                        why?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You could say my visions work in
                        mysterious ways.  Usually, they
                        take me places where I can help
                        people.

                                        LUCY
                        Maybe this time we're supposed to
                        help you.
                                  (heartfelt)
                        Cyrus has the answers you're
                          seeking, John.  Even if you haven't
                        figured out the questions yet.

          Johnny nods, his eyes going to Nora, who's picking at her
          food as she clutches her doll.

                                        JOHNNY
                        When did you two come here?

                        Almost a year ago.  Cyrus saved
                        me.  Saved both of us, didn't he,
                        honey?
                                (when Nora doesn't
                                  respond)
                        She's shy around strangers.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about this little girl here?

          He's referring to Nora's doll.

                                        LUCY
                        Nora knows she's not supposed to
                        bring Emily to meals.  Right?

          Nora remains silent, but puts the doll on her lap.  Off
          Johnny, watching her, troubled.


  49A49ATIME CUT

          The meal is being cleared.  Bruce leans toward Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        What'd you see before?

                                        JOHNNY
                        All these people, they're...
                        broken.  In pain.

                                        BRUCE
                        And I'll bet Carter uses that.*

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods to Roger)
                        That "brainwashing" thing Walt
                        talked about?  He really puts
                        them through a wringer.  Gets
                        them seeing things.

                                        BRUCE
                        Jesus.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We've got to get word out to Walt
                        to stop this raid, or they're all
                        going to die.  I've seen that,
                        too.

          Suddenly a bell chimes three times.  Pleased reactions.

                        Time for what?


  5050INT. CAFETERIA/CHAPEL - DAY - LATER - STARTING WIDE

          The cafeteria has been converted into a chapel, the sect
          members sitting in rows of folding chairs facing the dais,
          where Carter preaches, brandishing his Bible.  (See*
          Addendum A for his b.g. dialogue.)*

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        It was like Carter threw a switch
                        and they all became pod people.

          PANNING across rapt faces:  Frankel sitting with his wife
          and son; Roger; Lucy and Nora - the little girl still
            clutching her doll and staring past Carter at a shaft of
          light beaming through a high window.  Heavenly light.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        He played on their vulnerabilities
                        and fears, promising them
                        salvation.  Salvation that would
                        only come at the end of the Last
                        Days.

          Finding JOHNNY AND BRUCE seated near the back, watching
          Carter gesture with his Bible.  Bruce looks like some
          part of him is actually being affected by Carter's sermon. 
          As Johnny eyes him --

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        He was the prophet who would lead
                        them in the final battle against
                        the forces of Babylon.

          CARTER lays his Bible on a table.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        He said they had the weapons...

          As Carter now lays a semiautomatic HANDGUN atop the Bible --

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        ...and that they shouldn't be
                        afraid to use them.

          ON JOHNNY, worried.

    50CONTINUED:50

          He glances at a door in the back, then at Frankel, who's
          been keeping a suspicious eye on him.  Finally, Johnny
          and Bruce exchange a look.  Bruce gets the message:  a
          distraction is needed.

          ON CARTER --

                                        CARTER
                        "And I saw a strong angel
                          proclaiming with a loud voice,
                        Who is worthy to open the book
                        and loose the seals thereof?"

            Suddenly, Bruce stands --

                                        BRUCE
                        I saw the Angel!

          Heads turn, including Frankel's.  Carter gestures him
          forward.

                                        CARTER
                        Tell us, brother.

                                        BRUCE
                        When I was a boy, in my father's
                        church.  I beheld an Angel.
                                (takes a breath)
                          I beheld an Angel and he broke
                        the seal.

          Bruce is giving these people a taste of his own past as a
          boy preacher ("Zion"), a potent experience for him even
          if it is a ruse.  The sect members respond, a few calling
          out, "Tell us, Bruce" and "That's right," etc.

                                        BRUCE
                          I beheld the sun, black as
                          sackcloth... And the moon became
                        as blood... And in Heaven there
                        was Silence.  And the Angel said...

          ON FRANKEL, as he looks back, notes Johnny's empty chair.

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        ... come and see.

          Johnny enters cautiously, then reacts to the sleek computer
          set-up.  He moves to the desk, notes a PHOTO of Carter
          with a few followers, and realizes he's in Carter's office.

          He notes a DSL modem, its lights blinking, has an idea.

          Johnny exhales.  Then he notices a WEBCAM perched on the
          monitor.  He's about to touch it when --

                        Don't.

          Johnny turns to see Carter in the doorway, flanked by
          Frankel and another BURLY MAN.

                                        CARTER
                        I've got it set just the way I
                        like it.

                        Fine.  Right now we've got to
                        call off the raid.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        Why would I do that?

                                        WALT
                        John got a message out to my wife. 
                        Said if we go through with this,
                        people will die.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        The only way anyone's gonna die
                        is if that crazy bastard warns
                        them.

                                        WALT
                        If John's saying hold off, it's
                        'cause he's seen what'll happen
                        if we don't.
                                (when Seybold scoffs)
                        You haven't worked with him. 
                        This is a risk we can't afford to
                        take.

          Seybold considers him a beat, then --

                                        SEYBOLD
                        You're right.  Conditions change,
                        you adapt.
                                (to an Officer)
                        We're moving up the timetable by
                        24 hours.  We go tomorrow.

          Off Walt's surprise as Seybold crosses to his men...


  5757INT. COMPOUND - LUCY AND NORA'S ROOM - EVENING

          Starting on a DEVOTIONAL CANDLE near a PHOTO of Nora's
          father, then panning to a few of Nora's drawings and water
          colors, which depict angels, a child's view of heaven,
          and more disturbing images: bodies flying up out of graves.

          ON JOHNNY, seated on a child's bed, wrists cuffed behind
          him to a metal headboard, as he eyes the drawing.

                                        NORA
                        It's the Rapture.

          Johnny turns to see the little girl staring at him
            spookily, still holding her doll.

                                        NORA
                        Are you saved?


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT THREE - 8/17/05 - YELLOW  33.


    57CONTINUED:57

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.

                                        NORA
                        If you're not saved, you don't
                        get to go to heaven when the
                        Rapture comes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hope that won't happen for a
                        long time.

                                        NORA
                        I hope it happens soon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why?

          Nora points to a CRAYON DRAWING - a mother, father, and a
          little girl happily holding hands atop a cloud.

                                        NORA
                        'Cause my Daddy's in heaven, so
                        when my Mommy and I get there,
                        we'll be a family again.

          It's a disturbing statement.  Johnny has to wonder if
          Nora hasn't been doubly traumatized, first by her father's
          murder, then by Carter's Apocalyptic preachings.

                                        LUCY (O.S.)
                        Nora.

          She's standing in the doorway, holding a tray with a bowl
          of soup.

                                        LUCY
                        Honey, go downstairs with the
                        other kids.

          Nora starts to go, then turns to look at Johnny again.

                                        NORA
                        Can you really see the future?

                                        LUCY
                        Nora.

          Nora leaves, shutting the door.  Lucy puts the tray on a
          bedstand and sits in a chair by Johnny.

                                        LUCY
                          I thought you might be hungry.

                        Thanks.

          She lifts a spoonful to his lips.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You asked if I knew why my visions
                        led me here.

                                        LUCY
                        I can't talk about this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Lucy, I came here because I saw
                        someone die.  A child.

          He holds her look as she realizes...

                                        LUCY
                        Nora?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need to get her away from
                        here.  You both need to get away.

          Lucy stands up, torn.

                                        LUCY
                        Cyrus says you came here to spy
                        on us.  You didn't "see" anything.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Emily.  Her doll.  It's the same
                        one she's had since the carjacking. 
                        It's a connection to her father,
                        no wonder she won't let it go.
                                (off her look)
                        If you don't help me, Nora will
                        die.  And not just her--

                        No!

    5858SUDDENLY IT IGNITES INTO A SCREEN-FILLING INFERNO

          We hear Carter's voice, quoting from the Bible, his words
          then ECHOED by a group of his followers.

                                        CARTER (V.O.)
                        "And I will give power unto my
                        two witnesses..."

                                        FOLLOWERS (V.O.)
                        "And I will give power unto my
                        two witnesses..."

          As now, within the inferno, we detect TWO FIGURES, one
          close, the other further way, gesturing angrily.

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        I found out later they put
                          something in the water.


  5959INT. COMPOUND - N.D. ROOM - NIGHT - POV ANGLE

          TILTING UP from an empty WATER BOTTLE on the floor by a
          chair leg, to a ring of BLURRY and DISTORTED faces.  A
          man paces in the foreground, seen from the chest down, a
          Bible in his hand.

                                        CARTER
                        "And they shall prophesy a thousand
                        two hundred and threescore days,
                        clothed in sackcloth."


  6060WITHIN THE INFERNO

                                        FOLLOWERS (V.O.)

                        two hundred and threescore days,
                        clothed in sackcloth."

          Now we see that the first figure is Carter, wearing the
            sackcloth of a prophet.  As we approach the second...


  6161INT. ROOM - WIDER

            Revealing Bruce cuffed to a chair, sweating and disheveled,
          and, as Roger was before, ringed by Carter and a score of
          his followers, including Frankel.

                        I guess the drugs... all that
                        Bible thumping... I started to
                          hallucinate.

                        I believed I was having a vision.

          Bruce's blinking dilated eyes turn to follow...

          HIS POV - CLOSE ON CARTER (DRUG-DISTORTED)

          As he circles Bruce.

                                        CARTER & FOLLOWERS
                        "These are the two olive trees,
                        and the two candlesticks standing
                        before the God of the earth..."


  6262INFERNO VISION

          As camera now reveals the second figure.  It's Johnny,
            similarly robed in sackcloth.

                        and devoureth their enemies."

          And as we push in CLOSE on Johnny's angry features...


  6363INT. N.D. ROOM - BACK ON BRUCE

          As his eyes fly open.  He looks anxious, overwhelmed,
          clearly not in control of himself or his emotions.

                        I saw them.

          Carter crouches beside him, puts a hand on his shoulder.

                          Revelations, the ones who predict
                          Armageddon.  That one of them was
                        Carter, and the other was...

                        Smith?  He's lying!

          Carter turns back to Bruce, his tone patient and soothing.

                                        CARTER
                        How could John Smith be the Second
                          Prophet?

          A beat, then it's like the words just burn their way out
          of Bruce -- the awful truth that's been eating him alive.

                                        BRUCE
                        Because he's seen it.  Johnny's
                        seen Armageddon.

          Frankel and the others react, but Carter looks like he
          was expecting it.  He nods gravely... as the moment is
          interrupted --

                                        STILLSON (V.O.)
                        Excuse me.


  6666INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

          Stillson's tone is disparaging, but there's a hint of
          genuine curiosity, and perhaps surprise, in his expression.

                                        STILLSON
                        Are you saying Mister Smith has
                        seen the end of the world?

          Bruce is trying to testify honestly about what happened,
          but he's not about to spill this secret to Stillson.

                                        BRUCE
                        No.  I'm saying I was
                          hallucinating.  I'd been drugged,
                        kept up half the night.  I saw
                        what Carter wanted me to see.

                                        BRUCE
                        I think he used me, both of us,
                        to convince the others of something
                        he already believed.

          As Carter stands, nodding gravely.

                        It's the last sign... the one
                        we've been waiting for.  The Day

          Everything seems utterly still.  Then we detect a slight
          movement in the tall grass in the f.g. and, moving closer,
          see it's a camouflaged SNIPER.

          report.

          State police officers wearing flak jackets and SWAT

          BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  A series of EXPLOSIONS erupt along a
            perimeter between the officers and the compound, separating
          them.  The concussive force sends several officers
            sprawling in SLOW MOTION.  Panicked, other officers
          immediately OPEN FIRE on the building.  The gunfire is
            returned, bullets from the sect members' automatic rifles
          kicking up dirt.  We see TWO OFFICERS WOUNDED as others

  7474INT. STATE CAPITOL BUILDING - BATHROOM - DAY

          Johnny steps in and washes his hands, as we HEAR a FLUSH
          and Stillson steps out from the far stall.  He hesitates
          as he sees Johnny, then joins him at the sinks.

                                        STILLSON
                        Years ago, there would've been an
                          attendant here to hand you a nice
                        fluffy towel.  Now we've got sand
                        paper and liquid soap.  This
                        country has taken a big step
                        backwards.
                                (beat)
                        I think things are moving along
                        very well, don't you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't want to know what I
                        think.

                                        STILLSON
                        But I do.  I'm fascinated by
                        everything that goes on inside
                        that nutty head of yours.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why are you exploiting this
                        situation?

                                        STILLSON
                        It's my job to search for the
                        truth.

          Johnny can't help but smile, but it's a bitter smile.

                                        STILLSON
                          Something funny?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We both know why I'm here, and
                        why you wanted the media involved. 
                        So you could drag me around by
                        the neck and make yourself look
                        good.

                                        STILLSON
                                (adjusting his tie in
                                  mirror)
                        I think we both agree I look good.

                          A figurehead should look good.
                                (off his look)
                        Face it, Greg.  You're not calling
                        the shots anymore, are you?

                                        STILLSON
                        You think you know things, Smith. 
                        But you don't have a clue.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then tell me: how does it feel to
                        be a pawn?  To trade the life of
                        a woman you said you loved for
                        another rung on the ladder to
                        power?

          Stillson's smirk vanishes.

                                        STILLSON
                        Leave my wife out of this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your wife?  She never made it to
                        the altar, remember?  And who saw
                        to that?  You?  Malcolm Janus?

          Stillson controls his anger.

                                        STILLSON
                        Like I said, Smith.  You think
                        you know things.

                        I know you're a killer.  Your
                        father, and now Miranda.  Someday
                        they'll all see you for what you
                        are.

                                        STILLSON
                                (checks watch)
                        We should get back.

          He starts out, but Johnny grabs his arm, then reacts to
            something awful shooting through the theater of his mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know what you've got
                          planned, but I'm not going away. 
                        I'm going to be right there
                          waiting.

          Stillson yanks his arm away.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm counting on it.

          Stillson walks out, leaving Johnny to consider those
          cryptic words.


  7575EXT. COMPOUND - GRASSY FIELD NEAR COMMAND AREA - DAY

            A wounded Officer is being loaded into an AMBULANCE. 
          PULL BACK to reveal Walt watching, troubled, taking in a
          mass of SUVs, police vehicles, and milling, angry officers.

          He approaches Seybold, who's conferring with one of his
          lieutenants in the command area.

                                        SEYBOLD

          The officer nods and moves off as Walt approaches.

                        I won't let them turn this into a
                        media circus.  We regroup, hit
                        them with tear gas, then go in
                        hard.

                                        WALT
                        That's exactly what the Feds tried

                        You're playing right into their
                          paranoia.  We need to step back,
                        before this escalates.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        No, Sheriff.  You need to step
                        back.  Way back.

          He moves off.  Off Walt's frustration and concern...


  7676INT. CAFETERIA/CHAPEL - NIGHT

          Moving with Johnny, who's no longer handcuffed, as two
          men, armed with AR-15s, escort him into the room where
          Carter's assembled the sect members.  A number of the men
          are armed with rifles.  A woman is bandaging one man's
          wounded arm.

          Johnny expects a hostile reception, but instead the crowd
          parts for him, people murmuring "John" and "The Other,"
            revealing Carter at the dais, Frankel by his side, also
          armed with a rifle.  Bruce sits in a chair, looking like
          he's been through a wringer.

                                        CARTER
                        Welcome back, John.  I'm sorry
                        about your confinement.

          Johnny ignores him, moves to Bruce's side.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce?  You all right?

          Bruce is still shaky, but he's mostly suffering from guilt.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm sorry.

                        Opened his mind.  Then he opened
                        ours.

                                        BRUCE
                        I told them.

          And as Johnny reacts to this, Carter steps down.

                        Your coming was a sign, John.  As
                        sure as famine or war.  You and

                        He thinks you're the "second
                          witness" from Revelations.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (remembering)

                          Armageddon, John.  We've both
                        seen it.  Now it's here.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                        You can't deny your own visions. 
                        Accept your role, as I've accepted
                        mine.

          Johnny eyes Carter's followers, their determined, fervent
            expressions, knows that somehow he has to reach them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do all of you believe I'm the
                        Second Prophet?  Do you believe I
                        can see the future?

          Nods and murmurs of assent from the group.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have seen Armageddon.  Only
                        there weren't any angels, or
                          horsemen, or bodies of the
                          righteous flying up to Heaven.  I
                        saw fire.

          And as camera PANS to take in their reactions, we begin
          to SUPERIMPOSE images of the scenes Johnny describes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not God's fire.  The kind that
                        comes from man.

          Over which we see our classic Armageddon "beauty shot" of
          Washington being leveled by a massive fireball.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Our cities will be destroyed...

          Over which we see Christopher Wey surveying the dust-
          covered rubble that was once Baltimore ("Visions").

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...leaving a wasteland.  The dead*
                        will live only as memories...*

          As we see a 9-11-style wall of "missing" posters and
            handbills ("Finding Rachel: Part One").

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...and they'll be the lucky ones.*

          From the same show, we see flashes of deformed survivors,
          maybe even a flash of a burned and blind FUTURE JOHNNY.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Armageddon might be coming, but
                        it won't be God's doing, it'll be
                        ours.  Our choices.  Like the one*
                        you have today.  Ask yourselves
                        if it's worth risking your lives
                        so one man can call himself a
                          Prophet.
                                (looking around)
                        How about it, Lucy?

          LUCY's been standing with her arms lightly around her
          daughter's shoulders.  She looks away from Johnny but
            instinctively pulls Nora closer.  Johnny turns --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jacob?  Is this really why you
                        didn't pull the trigger that night,
                        so you could pull it now?

          FRANKEL reacts, then exchanges a look with his pregnant
          wife and son.  Carter sees the group is wavering.  He
          tries to reassert control, stepping closer to Johnny.

                                        CARTER
                        You disappoint me, John.  You've
                        been given the gift of light, but
                        you choose to live in darkness. 
                        Join us and be saved.

          But as he puts his hands on Johnny's shoulders -- WHOOSH!

          Sounds of gunfire outside, controlled pandemonium in the

                        people.  You're killing them!

          The sect members react with a mix of confusion and alarm. 
          Carter, stunned himself, is briefly speechless.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's rigged this place with
                          explosives.  He's going to make
                        you into martyrs.

          The others turn to Carter.

                        What does it matter how we
                          sacrifice our lives?  Babylon's 
                        fired the first salvo.  We've
                        seen the signs.  It's our time.

                                        FRANKEL
                        But what if it isn't?
                                (as Carter turns)
                        What if John was sent here to
                        tell us it's not our time.

          Carter stares at him like a wounded Caesar eyeing Brutus.

                                        CARTER
                        Jacob?  Are you doubting me, too?

                                        FRANKEL
                        We have families, Cyrus.  Children. 
                        What if you're wrong?

          Carter turns to another man, one of Johnny's guards.

                                        CARTER
                        Take his weapon.

          But the man just lowers his head.  The tide has turned. 
          Carter crossed to Frankel, wrenches his rifle away, then
          backs away and aims it wildly at his people.

                                        CARTER
                          Cowards!  You want salvation
                        without the sacrifice.  But God
                        has given me a mission, and I
                        won't shirk it.

          He rushes out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's it.  Exactly in my
                        footsteps.  Keep coming.

          One by one, he and Bruce help the others across.  But
            Suddenly, a line of armed officers appear from the border
          of woods ahead of them.  Johnny freezes, until he hears --

                                        WALT (MEGAPHONE)
                        John.  It's all right.  No one
                        will fire on you.

          WITH WALT AND THE OFFICERS

          Seybold hangs back, reluctantly letting Walt take charge
          of this rescue effort.  An AMBULANCE stands by.

          As JOHNNY sighs with relief, waving the others along. 
          Officers take custody of some members, MEDICS give others
          oxygen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        C'mon.  That's it.  Keep coming.

            Suddenly, a woman shouts, panicked --

                        Nora, no!

          Johnny turns, sees Nora standing alone in field, clutching
          her doll.  He takes a few steps toward her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nora!  Don't move!

          Frightened and confused, Nora calls out to her mother.

                                        NORA
                        You said when the Rapture came,
                        we'd be with Daddy.  If I die,
                        then I can go to heaven and be
                        with him.  We should both go.

                                        LUCY
                        No, honey!  Not this way!

          Johnny shushes Lucy with a gesture, then edges closer to
          Nora, each step again laced with danger.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nora, I know what it's like to
                        lose a father.  But I'm telling
                        you, as a father myself: he
                          wouldn't want you to join him
                        like this.

                        They said we'd be together again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know they did, honey.

          He inches closer, as we see Walt, Bruce, the other sect
          members, and even Seybold, tensely watching.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But your Daddy wouldn't want that
                        to happen now.  He wants to watch
                        you grow up, play and make friends,
                        and maybe someday have kids of
                        your own.  That's how you'll make
                        him happy.

          Tears are rolling down Nora's cheeks.

                                        NORA
                        How do you know?

                        my son.

          He holds out a hand.  A tense beat, then Nora dashes across
          the few dangerous yards separating them and leaps into
          his arms.

          WALT, BRUCE, and even Seybold collectively exhale.

                        He may've saved all of us.  I
                        know that those of us who shot at
                        the officers will be tried, but
                        none of us wanted to fight.  We
                        just wanted to be left alone to
                          practice our beliefs.

                        Thank you for your testimony, Ms.
                        Caron.  Madame Chairman, would
                        you agree we've heard enough?

          The Chairwoman considers, then nods.

          Johnny and Bruce wait amidst a crowd of milling PRESS. 
          Walt approaches.

                                        WALT
                        They're coming out.  Looks like
                        that "interference" charge against
                        you is gonna be dropped, John.

                                        BRUCE
                          Wouldn't look too good anymore,
                        would it?

          Stillson enters followed by the other panel members.  The
            Reporters surges toward him, shouting for comments. 
          Stillson quiets them with a gesture.

                                        STILLSON
                        What we heard today was
                          frightening, not just because of
                        what did happen but because of
                        what could have.  Ultimately,
                        there was only one confirmed
                          fatality: Mr. Carter himself. 
                        But even one life lost is too
                        many.
                                (speech mode)
                        An incident like this is proof
                        that it's time for change in this
                          country.  These people may have
                        been misguided, but they were not
                          a threat that had to be met with
                        deadly force.  We need leaders
                        capable of understanding that
                          dialogue is more valuable than
                          confrontation, and that
                          intimidating others through
                          violence, because we disagree
                        with their religious choices,
                          compromises who we are as a people
                        and a nation.  Thank you.

          But the Reporters trail him anyway as he moves off,
          shouting flattering follow-up questions like "Is it true
          you're already considering a Senate run?"  that suggest
            Stillson, and not Johnny, is the man of the hour.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How does he do it?

                                        WALT
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Make me look like a dangerous
                        lunatic while he comes off as a
                        hero?

                                        BRUCE
                        That 'man-of-the-people' act won't
                        play forever.  Folks'll catch on.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I wonder.

          Then he catches sight of Lucy and a bunch of sect members
          gathered in a park-like area at the base of the steps, a
          couple of them talking to Reporters.  Lucy waves to him.            DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT FOUR - 8/17/05 - YELLOW  54.

          sect member.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So you're gonna rebuild?

                                        LUCY
                        It was a good place for us.  For
                          a while, anyway.  I think it can
                        be again.

          Johnny watches Nora horsing around with some other kids.

                                        JOHNNY

                        She's excited.  She starts fourth
                        grade next fall.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No more home schooling?

                                        LUCY
                        Our kids need to know we're part
                        of a bigger world, and it's part
                        of us.

          She indicates Roger, who's showing off a new iPod to an
          attractive Female Reporter.

                                        LUCY
                        Roger just downloaded his first
                        "podcast."  Alternative Christian
                        Rock.  I didn't even know there

                        Like you said, it's a big world.

                                        LUCY
                        Sure you won't join our little
                        part of it, guide our evolving

                        I don't think you need another
                        "prophet".

          Lucy touches his arm, her warm smile pregnant with meaning.

                                        LUCY
                        Maybe you'll need us some day.

          She moves off to join her daughter.  Johnny looks around
          at the group of determined but cheerful people, and has
          to smile, too, as Bruce joins him.

                                        BRUCE
                        Guess I'm not the only one who

                        they'll do a better job of keeping
                        it?

          Johnny watches the sect members.

                        Maybe Armageddon shouldn't be a

                        It's one thing to believe the End

                        you can do something about it.

          Bruce nods, understanding.

                        At least then there's hope.

          And as Nora turns and catches Johnny's eyes, we feel that

                        From the Divine spark that animated*
                        us, to the Fire that will consume*
                        us.  And when the time comes for*
                        us to surrender our earthly shells,*
                        in a final battle that honors our*
                        faith and delivers our salvation,*
                        we will do so gladly.
