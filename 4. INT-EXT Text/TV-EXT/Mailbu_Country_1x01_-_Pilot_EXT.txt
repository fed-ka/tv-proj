    WE COME UP ON THE EXTERIOR OF AN F-150 TYPE OF TRUCK (WITH 
    REAR SEATING), DRIVING DOWN A HIGHWAY, PULLING A UHAUL 
    TRAILER.  WE HEAR AN UPBEAT, A CAPELLA SONG.

                                                                            CUT TO:

    (REBA, SHIRLEY)

    SHIRLEY IS RELAXING ON A LOUNGE CHAIR.  REBA ROUNDS THE 
    CORNER AND SITS NEXT TO HER.

                                      REBA

                  Hey, Mama.

                                      SHIRLEY

                  Hi, sweetie, how d it go?

                                      REBA

                  Well, I made an impression.

                                      SHIRLEY

                  So, not so good, huh?

                                      REBA

                  What was I thinking, counting on some 

                  old record contract?  I didn t even 

                  have a plan B.  Now what are we going 

                  to do for money?  How are we going to 

                  get by?

    SHIRLEY TRIES TO SUPPRESS A LAUGH.

                                      REBA (CONT D)

                  Did I say something funny?

                                      SHIRLEY

                  No, I just remembered something.

                                      REBA

                  What?

                                      SHIRLEY

                  ...I forget.  Anyway, go ahead, dear.    MALIBU COUNTRY PILOT                                    33.


                                      REBA

                  This is serious.  I mean, I didn t want 

                  the kids to worry, but all I ve ever 

                  been is Mrs. Russell Howard.  I wanted 

                  them to believe that I could take care 

                  of us. (BEAT, THEN) I guess I wanted to 

                  believe that, too. 

    SHIRLEY STARTS TO GIGGLE.

                                      REBA (CONT D)

                  What is it?!

                                      SHIRLEY

                  I just saw a pelican poop, and I m 

                  sorry, but that is funny.

                                      REBA

                  Have you been drinking?

                                      SHIRLEY

                  No, no.  I ve just been taking my 

                  anxiety medication.

    (REBA, KIM)

    REBA WALKS UP AND RINGS THE DOORBELL.  A BEAT, AND KIM 
    OPENS IT.

                                      KIM

                  Hey, Reba!  I was wondering when you 

                  would pop by.  Come on in!

                                      REBA

                  No, it s only going to take a minute.

    REBA TRIES TO STOP HER, BUT KIM IS GONE.

                                      REBA (CONT D)

                  (SIGH)  Fine.

    REBA ENTERS.

                                                                          RESET TO:

    (REBA, SHIRLEY)

    SHIRLEY IS  RELAXING  AGAIN.  REBA COMES RUSHING UP. 

                                      REBA

                  He loved it!  He says he s willing to 

                  let me make an album.  CD.  Whatever, 

                  he loved it!  All I need are twelve 

                  more songs. (THEN) Mama?

                                      SHIRLEY

                  (CLEARLY STONED) All I see are colors.

    AND WE:

                                                                          FADE OUT.
