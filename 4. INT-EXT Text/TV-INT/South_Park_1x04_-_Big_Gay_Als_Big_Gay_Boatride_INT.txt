               Cartman is at the head of the class, giving what appears to 
               be a book report.

                                     CARTMAN
                         And so you see, Simon and Simon were 
                         not brothers in real life, only on 
                         television.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Thank you for that presentation, 
                         Eric, but the assignment was on Asian 
                         cultures. You get a D-.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Aw, Dammit!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?

                                     MR. HAT
                         Well how about Stan, our little South 
                         Park quarterback star?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh, good idea. Okay, Stanly, you're 
                         next.

               Stan gets up.

                                     STAN
                         Umm... I'm not really prepared either.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well, just make something up like 
                         Eric did.

                                     STAN
                         Okay... Uh... Asian culture has... 
                         plagued our fragile Earth for many 
                         years. We must end it --

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Excellent! A-.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AY!

                                     STAN
                         Wow, cool!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Wait a minute! Why the hell does he 
                         get an A-?!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Eric, Stanly just might lead our 
                         team to victory against the Middle 
                         Park Cowboys for the first time in 
                         decades, and we treat star athletes 
                         better, because they're better people.

                                     CARTMAN
                         That's not fair!

                                     MR. HAT
                         Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to 
                         it.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (To himself)
                         Stupid puppet.

               The school bell rings. The kids all start to get up.

                                     MR. GARRISON (CONT'D)
                         Don't forget your assignments tonight, 
                         children. They're due tomorrow for 
                         everybody but Stan.

               The kids all walk out, but Stan stays behind and walks up to 
               Garrison's desk.

                                     STAN
                         Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a 
                         question?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Of course Stanly, what is it?

                                     STAN
                         What's a... homosexual?

               Mr. Garrison's eyes get a little wide, he takes a deep breath.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh... Well, Stanly, I guess you came 
                         to the right person... Sit down.

               Stan sits down, Mr. Garrison folds his hands.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                              (Soft and calm)
                         Stanly... Gay people... Well, gay 
                         people are evil. Evil right down to 
                         their cold black hearts, which pump 
                         not blood like yours and mine, but 
                         rather a thick, vomitus oil that 
                         oozes through their rotten veins and 
                         clots in their pea sized brains which 
                         becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque 
                         patterns of violent behavior. Do you 
                         understand?

                                     STAN
                         I guess.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Good, I'm glad we could have this 
                         little talk, Stanly. Now you go 
                         outside and practice football like a 
                         good little heterosexual.

               Stan blinks.


               The interior is ridiculously huge. Like the sports book at 
               Ceasars Palace.

               Ned and Jimbo walk up to the booking counter.

                                     JIMBO
                         I want five hundred dollars on the 
                         South Park Cows!

                                     BOOKIE
                         Are you crazy?

                                     JIMBO
                         No siree, I'm telling you I got the 
                         line. My nephew Stan is the best 
                         quarterback the school has ever seen. 
                         I GUARANTEE they'll beat the spread!!

               Suddenly, all the South Park residents go crazy placing bets 
               at the counter.

                                     TOWNSPERSON 1
                         I'm gonna put all my money on the 
                         Cows!

                                     TOWNSPERSON 2
                         I'll put three hundred on the cows 
                         if they guarantee it.

                                     TOWNSPERSON 3
                         Hey I wanna put some money on the 
                         cows too!

                                     TOWNSPERSON 1
                         He guarantees it?

                                     JIMBO
                         Uh -- Woa... Woa... Don't get TOO 
                         carried away, now... I...

               The place is an absolute frenzy, everyone in South Park is 
               betting their life savings.

                                     TOWNSPERSON 3
                         You better be right about this, Jimbo.

                                     JIMBO
                              (A little uneasy)
                         Huh, huh... yea, don't, don't worry 
                         yourself.

                                     NED
                         Are you sure Stan is that good?

                                     JIMBO
                              (Quietly)
                         Not THAT sure... I think we better 
                         come up with a back up plan... Uh 
                         let's see. Hey Bookie, what's the 
                         half time show gonna be?

                                     BOOKIE
                         You haven't heard? John Stamos' older 
                         brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 
                         'Loving You'.

                                     NED
                         I love that song.

                                     JIMBO
                         Loving You?? THAT'S PERFECT!!! Come 
                         on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a 
                         halftime show they'll never forget!

                                     NARRATOR
                         And now back to Jesus and Pals on 
                         South Park public access.


               Jesus sits at a desk with his hands folded.

                                     JESUS
                         Yea, many of you are seeking answers. 
                         And I am the way for you my children. 
                         Let's open the phone lines back up 
                         for some questions.

               Jesus hits a button on the desk.

                                     JESUS
                         Hello caller, you're on the air.

                                     MAN
                         Yeah, is this Jesus?

                                     JESUS
                         Yes my son.

                                     MAN
                         This... this is Robert from Torrey 
                         Pines. I called last week asking for 
                         advice on my Ex-wife.

                                     JESUS
                         Of course, Robert, how are things 
                         now?

                                     MAN
                         Everything's much better, Jesus, she 
                         hasn't mouthed off since. I just 
                         wanted to thank you for the advice. 
                         Oh, and for dying for my sins, too. 
                         That was really nice of you.

                                     JESUS
                         Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, 
                         you're on the air.

                                     STAN
                         Uh, hi, Jesus? I have a dog... And 
                         he's... Uh... He's a homosexual.

                                     JESUS
                         My son, a lot of people have wondered 
                         what my stance on homosexuality is. 
                         So I'd like to state once and for 
                         all my true opinion. You see --

               Suddenly, the image is replaced by a card that reads 'South 
               Park Public Access'.

                                     NARRATOR
                         That's all the time we have left for 
                         Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for 
                         Marty's Movie Reviews!


               Stan angrily hangs up the phone.

                                     STAN
                         DAMMIT!

                                     KYLE
                         What'd he say?

                                     STAN
                         I got cut off for Marty's stupid 
                         Movie Reviews!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh Marty's Movie reviews are on?! 
                         Kick ass!!

               Cartman leaves.

                                     STAN
                         ISN'T THERE ANYBODY WHO CAN HELP 
                         ME?!?! ISN'T THERE ANYBODY WHO CARES?!

                                     KYLE
                         Come on, dude, we have to get to 
                         practice.

                                     STAN
                         NO IT'S NOT OKAY!! I DON'T WANT A 
                         GAY DOG!!!


               Jimbo and Ned are sitting at a small table looking at a small 
               bomb.

                                     JIMBO
                         What we want to do, Carl, is put a 
                         trigger on that bomb that makes it 
                         go off at a specific moment during 
                         halftime.

                                     CARL
                         And what moment would that be?

                                     JIMBO
                         Well, John Stomos' older brother is 
                         all set to sing 'Loving You' during 
                         halftime. We want that bomb to go 
                         off when he hits that high F.

                                     CARL
                         What high F?

                                     JIMBO
                         You know --

                                     CARL
                         Doot'n doot'n doo doo. Ahhhhh, Uh 
                         yea okay.


               The animals continue to dance. Stan dances techno with them, 
               when suddenly he spots something.

                                     STAN
                         SPARKY!!

                                     SPARKY
                         Bark.

               Sparky walks over with his pink bandana, happy to see Stan.

                                     STAN
                         Hiya Sparky, how's it going?

                                     SPARKY
                         Bark.

                                     STAN
                         I missed you, old pal, you really 
                         had me scared.

                                     SPARKY
                         Bark.

                                     STAN
                         Come on, let's go home, I can still 
                         make it in time for the game.

               Sparky starts to follow Stan out.

                                     STAN
                         We can work on making you not gay 
                         together.

               Sparky stops in his tracks. Stan turns back around, puzzled.

                                     STAN
                         Sparky?

               Just then, Big Gay Al walks up behind Stan.

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         Young man it appears you still don't 
                         understand.

                                     STAN
                         What don't I understand?

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         Come this way, I have to show you 
                         something.


               Stan follows Big Gay Al through a large Corridor.

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         Okay Stan, I think you should get in 
                         line for my big gay boat ride.

               Big Gay Al points to a Disneyland-esque ride with 'Big Gay 
               Al's Big Gay Boat Adventure' sign above it.

               Little wooden boats travel along a man-made canal, similar 
               to the Jungle Cruise.

               About four people are standing in line.

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         Step aboard, Stanly.

               Stan and Big Gay Al get on one of the little boats, which 
               heads down the canal. Big Gay Al picks up a microphone at 
               the front of the boat.

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         Hello everyone, and welcome aboard 
                         the big gay boat ride. On this 
                         adventure, we'll be seeing the world 
                         of gayness throughout time.

               Stan blinks.


               The Cowboys kick off the ball to the Cows.

                                     SPORTSCASTER FRANK
                         And the South Park Cows are set to 
                         receive... There's the kick... It's 
                         taken by number 23, Kenny McKormik.

               Kenny grabs the ball and runs down the field. He actually 
               manages to dodge some tacklers!

               He runs faster and faster! He just might make a good play!

                                     SPORTSCASTER FRANK
                         He's at the 50! The 40! The 30!

               Suddenly, two Middle Park players tackle Kenny, violently 
               ripping off one of his arms. Kenny starts bleeding profusely, 
               then gets his head ripped off by another Cowboy player.

                                     SPORTSCASTER FRANK
                         The little running back is DOWN! I 
                         think he's... Yes he's been 
                         decapitated!

                                     KYLE
                         OH MY GOD! THEY'VE KILLED KENNY! YOU 
                         BASTARDS!!

                                     SPORTSCASTER PHIL
                         That's gotta hurt, Frank!

                                     SPORTSCASTER FRANK
                         Ouch-a-roo!

                                     CHEF
                         Hey, come on, that was roughing!! 
                         ...At least let us scrape him off 
                         the field!!

                                     SPORTSCASTER FRANK
                         Looks like the South Park Cows aren't 
                         even going to beat the 72 point 
                         spread, not by a long shot.


                                     BIG GAY AL
                         You see, Gayness has existed since 
                         the beginning of time...

               The boat passes little animatronic cave men. Two of the cave 
               men are holding hands.

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         From the Egyptian Pharaohs...

               The boat passes two gay Egyptian men.

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         To the Shoguns of Japan...

               Two Shoguns in a techno dance club.

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         Oh, oh! Look out! It's the oppressors! 
                         Christians and Republicans and Nazis 
                         OH MY!

               Three lame animatronics dressed respectively as a Christian, 
               a Republican and a Nazi, beat an innocent homosexual with a 
               pipe.

               Just like the jungle cruise, Big gay Al takes out a fake 
               pistol and fires blanks at the animatronics.

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         Hoo! Oh gosh That was close! Okay 
                         let's steer our big gay boat out of 
                         here, and into a place where gays 
                         are allowed to live freely...

               The boat passes through to large doors, which open into a 
               HUGE, colorful, festive room where tons of animatronics dance 
               and sing merrily.

                                     SONG
                         We're all gay and it's okay! 'Cause 
                         gay means happy and happy means gay! 
                         We're not sad anymore 'cause we're 
                         out the closet door! It's OKAY to be 
                         GAY!!

               Stan looks around in disbelief. All the gay things dance, 
               sing and do silly things.

                                     SONG
                         It's okay to be Gay! it's okay to be 
                         Gay! La La La La La...

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         So what do you think, Stan?

                                     STAN
                         This kicks ass!

               Stan looks down at Sparky.

                                     STAN
                         I'm sorry I tried to change you, 
                         Spark. I just didn't understand.

               Sparky barks and pants happily. Stan pets him on the head.

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         Isn't this precious?
