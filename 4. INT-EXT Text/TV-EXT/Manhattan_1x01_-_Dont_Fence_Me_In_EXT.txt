Silent canyons.  Mountains surrendering to dust.  Could be 
the ancient past or some apocalyptic future.

In fact, it s the dawn of America s superpower heyday, 
Springtime, 1944.

The only sign of life is a black DESOTO SEDAN speeding on an 
empty night road, kicking up sand.



A DEPUTY, 30s, permanent sunburn, rolls up to Frank s window.

DEPUTY
Trying to kill somebody?2.


But Frank is oblivious.  He s feverishly jotting NOTES.  The 
Deputy just a buzzing fly.

DEPUTY (CONT D)
Hey Hemingway -- 

Frank holds up a finger: one minute.

DEPUTY (CONT D)
Step out of the car.
(hand on gun)
Now.

Frank finally looks up.  Does as he s told.  The cop pats him 
down, pulls a DRIVER S LICENSE from his wallet.

ECU THE LICENSE.  Type-written in the name column is  NUMBER 
22.   The address reads  BOX 1663. 

DEPUTY (CONT D)
You get this thing in a cereal box?

FRANK
There s a phone number in my 
wallet.  Do me a favor and have 
somebody call it.

The Deputy peers inside the car, spots the flask.

DEPUTY
Been drinking tonight, chief?

Frank sizes up the Deputy.  Evenly:

FRANK
Listen.  I m going to ask you to 
trust me and let me go.  You ll 
save both of us some trouble.

The Deputy nods.  Out come the cuffs.



Arid, endless, empty of promise.  The sun already scorching.  
Might as well be Arabia, or Mars.  O.S. the rumble of a CAR.



Throngs of crisply-dressed men in fedoras stream toward a 
barbed-wire fence.  Beyond it lies a campus of nondescript 
clapboard buildings, secret nucleus of a secret city.

Amid the crush, Frank gestures with a page of notes, talking 
Babbit through last night s breakthrough.

FRANK
Not explosive charges -- explosive 
lenses.
(off Babbit)
We bend the detonation waves, same 
way your glasses bend light.  
Streamline the build.  It ll save 
time.

Babbit takes the paper, studies it, impressed.  Then peers at 
Frank, who looks like hell.

BABBIT
You can t work in your office like 
everybody else?8.


FRANK
I do my best analytic geometry in 
the car.

BABBIT
They already think you re out of 
your tree.  And I know you don t 
care, but the General does, and 
he s the guy who signs our budget.

FRANK
It s the military.  Give  em a 
billion taxpayer dollars, they blow 
it on green paint and chicken wire.

Babbit and Frank hand IDs to an armed SOLDIER at the gate.  



SNIP!  CLOSE ON SHEARS decapitating a ROSE.

LIZA WINTER (39) picks her way through a lush community 
garden, collecting stems.  Her hair is pulled back.  She s 
beautiful, even in a men s shirt and trousers, but there s a 
loneliness about her.

She stops at a plot of violet CHRYSANTHEMUMS.  One blossom 
stands apart -- it s a hallucinatory YELLOW.  Odd.  Liza 
frowns, cuts the stem at its base, as we abruptly

CUT TO:

A DRAWER flying open.  HANDS search clothes -- underwear, T-
shirts.  18.


Moving with cold efficiency, finding an envelope of scallop-
edged PHOTOS: Frank and Liza Winter on a boat, Liza laughing.  
Three years and a lifetime ago.  We are:



Abby Bell and the twins stand pondering something O.S.

JUDY
It s green!

And here s their new home: a grim clapboard four-plex, 
painted like a barracks.  Abby stares, shell-shocked.



Abby stands, helpless, as the welcome wagon unloads her car.

FAY
You ll want to join the Mesa Club 
and the Culture Council.

MAY
And the book group, obviously.

MARY-ELLEN
You re a science widow now.  Sit 
around and you ll kill yourself.

MAY
What s your church?  Lutheran?  
Methodist?

May hefts a box out of the trunk.  On top is a MENORAH.  She 
bites her tongue.

ABBY
Physicist.  Charlie s god is Albert 
Einstein.

FAY
(tactful subject change)
You re lucky with twins.  They 
ration the Indians.  You ll jump 
straight to the front of the line.

Fay nods to indicate an Indian MAID, 20s, passing with a 
group of CHILDREN.  The kids  heads are SHAVED.  Creepy.

MARY-ELLEN
(opens cigarette pack)
Just watch out the help doesn t 
smoke your husband s peace pipe.
(re cigarette)
Don t tell my Walter.  
(MORE)21.

MARY-ELLEN (CONT'D)
If the men can keep secrets we re 
entitled to a few of our own.

ABBY
What do you mean?

MARY-ELLEN
Oh, you know.  What they do behind 
their fences.

FAY
I heard they re building submarines 
and floating them down the Rio 
Grande.

Abby stares at the children s shaved heads.

ABBY
They look like little convicts.

MARY-ELLEN
Head lice.  I spent a day picking 
nits out of my best sweater.

AN EXPLOSION thunders across the mesa!  Abby jumps.  The 
women barely blink, detonations common as car horns here.

ABBY
What was that?

The women smile beatifically.  A Greek chorus of inanity.

MAY
You re going to love it here, 
really.



Crosley, Liao, Meeks, Fritz and Helen hustle across the 
compound crawling with ARMY PERSONNEL.

LIAO
(re soldiers)
They re like fucking fruit flies.  
Every fifteen minutes the 
population doubles.

CROSLEY
Colonel s beefing up security.  
Site Z is about to start pumping 
out Product.

Fritz peers around, leery of eavesdroppers.22.


FRITZ
Urchin or Apple?

HELEN
Opal.

FRITZ
What?

HELEN
It s not  Apple,  it s  Opal. 

FRITZ
Then what s Apple?

LIAO
There is no Apple.  It s a goddamn 
fruit.

A JEEP cuts them off.  Inside are the corn-fed MPs who found 
the manila envelope.  MP 1 singles out Fritz, Liao and Meeks.

MP 1
You three.  Get in.



A half-dozen freshly-arrived GIs hump kit-bags through a dust 
bowl of Quonset huts and trailers, among them our freckled 
Iowan kid.  A gruff STAFF SERGEANT plays tour guide.

STAFF SGT
Used to be a private boarding 
school, toughen up rich 
pantywaists.  When it s dry you get 
sandstorms, when there s rain it s 
a swamp.  Only action you ll see is 
in the Universal Newsreel.

Iowa, weighed down by luggage, nips at the Sergeant s heels.

IOWA
Sir?  Excuse me, Sergeant?

STAFF SGT
That s West Mess Hall.  We call it 
Worst Mess Hall, you ll figure out 
why.  The PX is behind it.  That s 
the dorm where the WACs bunk.  Get 
caught in there, the court-martial 
is the least of your worries.
(off Iowa)
V.D.

IOWA
Sir I think there s... Somebody 
made a mistake.  They said I d be 
fighting in Europe.

They arrive at a vast canvas tent full of bunk beds.31.


STAFF SGT
At great expense, your president 
has gathered the world s largest 
collection of prima donnas and 
longhairs in a Mexican sandbox.  
It s your job to baby-sit them.

Iowa looks like he could cry.



Frank hunkers against the cold, headed in to work.  The husky 
soldier at the gate blocks his path, hand on his sidearm.

FRANK
You remember looking at my badge 
this morning?  And every morning 
for the last ten months?

Frank clips on his badge.  The soldier stands down.

SOLDIER
There s a war on.

FRANK
No kidding.



Bleary-eyed, half-asleep, our freckled Iowan GI rides in the 
bed of a truck full of soldiers armed with shovels.

GUNFIRE echoes in the woods as they bump up a dirt road and 
stop in a clearing.

As the GIs debark, two SOLDIERS emerge from the trees, the 
first with a BROWNING MACHINE GUN slung over his shoulder, 
the second hefting an ANTELOPE HEAD, gore trailing from the 
neck.  The soldiers  cheeks are painted with blood.39.


SOLDIER
(holding up head)
Lookit -- I got Joseph Goebbels!

The GIs whoop.  Off Iowa, wide-eyed, wondering how the fuck he 
got here.



Fritz huffs to keep up with Frank striding back from the mess 
hall.  They haven t slept and it shows.  Frank s got coffee 
in one hand, a sheaf of typed onionskins in the other.

FRANK
You know how to work a mimeograph?  
We need copies in case Oppenheimer 
has to sell it in D.C.

He hands Fritz the onionskins.

FRANK (CONT D)
Where are we on the numbers?

FRITZ
Still at it.  And we re running out 
of nylons.41.


Frank doesn t have time to ask, because up ahead a loose 
crowd of LAB PERSONNEL stands watching two MPs frog-march a 
worried SCIENTIST out of a lab building.

Frank and Fritz join Crosley, Babbit, Helen and two LAB TECHS.

FRANK
The hell s going on?

BABBIT
They drafted Bill Seaver.

FRANK
What?

BABBIT
Effective this morning he s a 
private in Pharaoh s army.

FRITZ
They can do that?

CROSLEY
They ve got tanks.  They can do 
whatever they want.

The MPs stiff-arm the drafted man into the back of a car.  
Babbit locks eyes with Frank, grave.

BABBIT
MPs found a lab book in his dorm 
room.  

ON CROSLEY, processing this news, thinking.

Troubled, Frank watches the car pull away, ferrying the 
doomed scientist into military limbo.



An olive-drab stretched Packard limousine clears the security 
gate leaving the Hill.  Surreal opulence in the desert.



Blinding sun.  A JEEP idles, waiting to taxi Frank home.

FRANK
What about you?  What do you 
believe?

In the back of the army limo, the most powerful scientist in 
history puts on his hat.

OPPENHEIMER
I believe the world is on fire and 
Thin Man s our chance to put it out.  
You ll report directly to Akley.

He offers up the implosion brief.  Case closed.  Frank 
standing there, defeated -- then taking the papers.

The limo rumbles off, leaving Frank in a rooster-cloud of 
dust, in the middle of nowhere, a year of work dead in his 
hands.



Liza stands over a row of VIOLET CHRYSANTHEMUMS, collecting 
fresh bouquets to replace yesterday s.  She frowns, noticing 
a YELLOW BUD.  Then a SECOND.  A THIRD.

Now that she s looking, she finds irregularities everywhere.  
Plants that are curiously wilted. Plants with mutations --  
Some beautiful, some strange.  She s mystified, unable to 
fathom the monster growing under her nose.



Liao s in the glass coffin of a phone booth, an impatient 
queue of SCIENTISTS waiting.  One outside line for a staff of 
a thousand.

LIAO
(into phone)
Just hold it up to her ear ... So 
wake her up.  All she does is 
sleep, she s a baby.

A Scientist glares at Liao, taps his watch.  Liao ignores it, 
cradling the phone.  Suddenly awkward, fumbling for words:54.


LIAO (CONT D)
Hi Gracie.  It s Sid.  It s your 
father.

A KNOCK at the glass.

LIAO (CONT D)
(covering mouthpiece)
Jesus, hold your --

But it s not the Scientist.  It s two MPs.



A fortress in the high desert silence.



Somewhere a radio is playing.  Families laugh in lit windows.  
Life carrying on, but not for Sid Liao.  Liao stalks down a 
residential street, alone, weaving a little.  He tests the 
doors of a row of parked CARS.  All locked.66.


Finally the door of an OLDSMOBILE swings open.  Liao looks 
around -- about to cross a line that can never be uncrossed.  
A spitting rain picks up as he gets in the driver s seat. 



BING CROSBY
Oh give me land, lots of land, 
under starry skies above / Don t 
fence me in

SOLDIERS sit or lean on bunks, passing a bottle.  The young 
CORPORAL who slugged Liao at the party holds forth.

CORPORAL
I m telling you, kid went down like a 
bowling pin.  I barely touched him.

SOLDIER
Hey Schmelling.  What happened to 
your sidearm?

The Coporal looks down at SHOULDER HOLSTER.  It s EMPTY.

CORPORAL
The fuck?



BING CROSBY
Send me off forever, but I ask you 
please / Don t fence me in

Lashing rain.  Liao second in line.  The GI at the window of 
the lead car nods to his partner.  Up goes the gate.

This is Liao s moment.  He hits the gas.  But before he can 
tail the lead car off the Hill, the gate slams down.

GI
Whoa, buddy.  This ain t the Indy 
500.  You gotta show me your pass.
(seeing Liao)
No tickee no washee.

Liao stares ahead through the windshield, gun in his hand, 
hand in his lap.  His hand is shaking.

In Liao s POV, we watch taillights recede and wink out on the 
far side of the gate.  So close to freedom he can taste it.68.


LIAO
(low)
Open the gate.

The GI looks at his partner, hunkered against the weather, 
sensing something wrong.

GI
Step out of the car, will ya?

LIAO
Open the gate.

The GI leans in, sees the gun leveled at his chest.

GI
The fuck are you --

BLAMMM!  The passenger window explodes!

ANGLE ON the second GI, gun outstretched.

It s our freckled Iowan newcomer.  We ll come to know him as 
PRIVATE COLE DUNLAVEY.  Only child of elderly parents, writer 
of science fiction stories, huge hearted.  For now, he s just 
a scared kid a long way from home.  He drops the gun.

COLE
What d I do?

GI opens the car door and Liao half-slumps out onto the wet 
road.  Right side of his head is gone, a mess of red.



BING CROSBY
And I can t look at hovels and I 
can t stend fences / Don t fence me 
in...

The klaxon sounds, again and again.  As Bing Crosby croons, 
we RISE above the tree-lined streets to find a GUARD TOWER 
and the miles of BARBED WIRE FENCING that protect the world s 
most closely guarded secret from the desert wasteland beyond.

The pitched suburban rooftops could be Levittown, any town.  
The first of many JEEPS speeds toward the main gate and we --

FADE TO WHITE.
