      FADE IN:

      INT. AUDRY S - DAYA1A1

      The ramshackle dive.  Sparsely populated.  We re on BOYD 
      CROWDER, posted up in a corner of the bar --

      When DEWEY CROWE slides up beside Boyd.  To the BARTENDER:

                                  DEWEY (O.C.)
                    Bourbon.  You can keep the ice.
                          (then, to Boyd)
                    Hey Boyd.  You mind?

      Boyd, eyes glazed, takes in Dewey.

                                  BOYD
                    Not at all, Dewey.

                                  DEWEY
                    Surprised to see you here.  Thought 
                    you d given up these poisons.

                                  BOYD
                    I had.  But things have changed 
                    quite a bit since last we spoke.

                                  DEWEY
                    You mean, when you had your gun 
                    pointed at me?

                                  BOYD
                    The irony in that, of course, is 
                    that me pointing my gun at you is 
                    the only reason you re alive today.

                                  DEWEY
                    Yeah, heard you had some trouble 
                    out there.

                                  BOYD
                    More than some.

      The Bartender comes back, sets down Dewey s Bourbon.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Three twenty-five.

      Dewey reaches into his pockets, fumbles a mess of CHANGE onto 
      the BAR.  Counts it as Boyd and the Bartender stare.  Dewey 
      finishes counting.  Looks up at the disapproving Bartender.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    2.

      CONTINUED:A1A1

                                  DEWEY
                    It s currency ain t it?

      The Bartender gathers the change, heads off.  Boyd just 
      stares, amused by Dewey.

                                  DEWEY (CONT D)
                    What?

      Boyd just shakes his head, as an attractive working girl 
      named ELLEN MAY walks up to Dewey, slides a hand across his 
      back.

                                  ELLEN MAY
                    Dewey Crowe.  How re you this fine 
                      afternoon?

                                  DEWEY
                    I m good, Ellen May.  And you?

                                  ELLEN MAY
                    I dunno.  You tell me...

                                  DEWEY
                          (then)
                    Afraid I don t have nothing for you 
                    right this second,  but I ll be 
                    back real soon, and I m gonna be 
                    flush.

                                  ELLEN MAY
                          (same old story)
                    You ever get it together, you know 
                    where to find me.

      And Ellen May saunters off.  Dewey watches her go, 
      practically licking his lips.

                                  BOYD
                    Be happy to help you out, if you 
                    like.

                                  DEWEY
                    I don t need your charity, Boyd.  I 
                    got things lined up.

                                  BOYD
                    I m certain that you do.

                                  DEWEY
                    What, you don t believe me?
                          (then, sotto)
                    You heard of them Oxy busses?  
                                  (MORE)


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    3.

      CONTINUED: (2)A1A1
                                  DEWEY (CONT'D)
                    Make the runs down to Florida, come 
                    back with a shipment of pills?
                          (Boyd nods)
                    Well I just happen to be getting on 
                    one of them tonight.  Gonna nab me 
                    a sweet little pay day.

                                  BOYD
                    That s very enterprising of you.

                                  DEWEY
                    Damn straight.  Come back in here, 
                    get me some of Ellen May and every 
                    other piece of ass in this joint.

      Dewey slams his drink.

                                  BOYD
                    Whatever puts a smile on your face, 
                    Dewey.

                                  DEWEY
                          (rises, then)
                    You know Boyd, for a guy who s 
                      supposedly changed, you sound an 
                    awful lot like you always did.

      And with that, Dewey Crowe is up and gone.

11INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT 

      An old school, out of the way kind of place.  On stage, Dave 
      Alvin is just about finished setting up.

      Amidst all this, we find RAYLAN and WINONA, at a table, 
      drinking beer.

                                  WINONA
                    I m so glad we did this.  Can t 
                    remember the last time I saw live 
                    music.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (then)
                    What are we doing, Winona?

                                  WINONA
                    You mean right now?
                          (unsure)
                    Having a beer, about to see Dave 
                    Alvin?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    3A.

                                  RAYLAN
                    At a roadhouse 50 miles from 
                      Lexington.

                                  WINONA
                          (not following)
                    Was he playing somewhere else 
                    tonight?









































                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    4.

      CONTINUED: (2)11

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, and that s my point.

                                  WINONA
                    What s your point?

                                  RAYLAN
                    If he were playing in Lexington, 
                    would we have gone to see him?
                          (then, elaborating)
                    We drive to the middle of nowhere 
                    anytime we wanna go out in public.
                    Lie to our friends.  We ve eaten so 
                    many meals in bed I m starting to 
                    feel like the grandparents in Willy 
                    Wonka.

                                  WINONA
                    I thought we were being discreet.

                                  RAYLAN
                    When Gary didn t know about us I 
                      understood that.

                                  WINONA
                    Just because Gary knows, doesn t 
                    mean the whole world s got to.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I just don t see why--

                                  WINONA
                    Because I m still married, Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    So what if you weren t?

                                  WINONA
                    That s a longer conversation.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I want to be with you, Winona.  And 
                    I don t care who knows it.

                                  WINONA
                          (then)
                    Do you know how people are going to 
                    look at me when I tell them I m 
                    divorcing husband number two to go 
                    back to husband number one?

                                  RAYLAN
                    That depends: will they know which 
                    husband I was?

                                  WINONA
                    Like I m somewhere between pathetic 
                    and delusional.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I was joking.

                                  WINONA
                    I wasn t.

      Then, on stage, the band finished tuning up.

                                  DAVE ALVIN
                    How s everyone doing tonight?

      A general hum of energy rises amongst the audience.

                                  DAVE ALVIN (CONT D)
                    I d like to start with something I 
                    just recently wrote.  Hope you 
                    enjoy it.

      Then, the MUSIC STARTS.  It should be the end of the 
        conversation... but it won t be.  A few beats, and then:

                                  RAYLAN
                    Does this mean you re not planning 
                    on divorcing Gary?

                                  WINONA
                    Can we talk about this later?

                                  RAYLAN
                          (no)
                    Because if you re not, then I 
                    really don t know what the hell 
                    we re doing--

                                  WINONA
                    Maybe I wouldn t be so hesitant to 
                    tell the world and divorce Gary if 
                      I actually felt like you and I 
                    could be a happy couple.

      And there it is.  This just sits there, then:

                                  RAYLAN
                    I can t believe you just said that.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    4B.

                                  WINONA
                    I m sorry, it s just... tonight was 
                    supposed to be fun, you know?  This 
                    was supposed to be fun.

      Winona turns away from Raylan, then sees something, she 
      shakes her head, cannot believe this is happening.

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    Tim s here.
                          (on Raylan: what?)
                    Tim Gutterson, your fellow Marshal?  
                    He s at the bar.





































                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    5.

      Raylan now turns, and sure enough --

      There s TIM.  Waiting for a beer alongside a guy named BEN, 
      20s, handsome, solemn.  It appears Tim hasn t seen Raylan and 
      Winona yet, and they both realize that.

                        RAYLANWINONA
      Let s invite him over--Let s get out of here--

      A beat.

                        RAYLANWINONA
      Are you serious--You can t be serious--

      A beat.

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    Were you listening to a single word 
                    I just said?

                                  RAYLAN
                    The band just started!

      Winona checks to make sure Tim still hasn t seen them, which 
      he apparently hasn t.  Then:

                                  WINONA
                    Either give me your keys or leave 
                    with me now.

      Raylan considers, then moves to leave the booth, as does 
      Winona.  Off these two, slipping out, Dave Alvin still 
      rocking on, Tim Gutterson apparently never seeing them.

      EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY22

    A quiet, backwoods road.  We re on a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS that 
      rolls past us, CHURCH OF THE MODERN DAY SAVIOR painted on the 
      side, and then we re --

      INT. CHURCH BUS - DAY33

      Moving down the aisle, past TIRED PASSENGERS, greasy and 
      unkept... they ve been on this bus a few days and it d be 
      great if we could sense that.  Then, towards the BACK of the 
      bus we find Dewey, who despite the mood around him, is 
      anxious and fidgety, and then we re --  

      At the front of the bus.  Where the DRIVER sees that they re 
      approaching a CLOSED OFF BRIDGE.  Slows, then STOPS.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    5A.

        CONTINUED:33

      On BOBBY, 30s, napping, seated right behind the driver.  Upon 
      realizing they re stopped he STIRS, gets to his feet, 
      addressing the driver:

                                  BOBBY
                    Why are we stopped?

      The driver just nods, to indicate what Bobby has seen as he s 
      asked the question... namely, the DETOUR.  Shit...

      ON DEWEY

      Who s out of his seat, moving towards the front with urgency.

      Bobby, turning back to his seat, blocks him.

                                  BOBBY (CONT D)
                    Go back to your seat.

                                  DEWEY
                    Come on Bobby, I gotta drain it.

                                  BOBBY
                    Hold it.

                                  DEWEY
                    I been holding it!

      As Bobby reaches below his seat, extracts a SHOTGUN.























                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    6.

                                  BOBBY
                    Sit.  Now.

      Dewey sits.  Passengers are stirring, wondering why they re 
      stopped.

                                  DRIVER
                    You want me to back it up?

      But Bobby doesn t answer, as he scours the horizon --

      ON DEWEY, returning to his seat, tense --

      As a PASSENGER named ELROD (30s, thick, bumbling) rises from 
      his SEAT, pulls a GUN, steps into the AISLE and AIMS --

      As BOBBY catches a GLIMPSE of ELROD in the REARVIEW MIRROR, 
      HITS THE DECK --

      As ELROD FIRES, missing Bobby and putting a BULLET through 
      the FRONT WINDSHIELD --

      As all the passengers PANIC, GET LOW IN THEIR SEATS --

      BOBBY, in the STAIR WELL, FIRES back at Elrod, who DIVES INTO 
      A SEAT, the BLAST BLOWING OUT A WINDOW --

      ELROD takes aim over a SEAT BACK and FIRES at Bobby, missing 
      him, the BULLETS SHATTERING the DOOR S GLASS --

      As DEWEY, crouched and huddled, watches all this happen --

      As BOBBY tries to get a line on Elrod, about to SHOOT HIS 
      FEET, when he s SHOT FROM BEHIND, his BRAINS splattering 
      across the BUS S FLOOR and onto the DRIVER S PANTS.

      ELROD now rises, cautiously moves towards Bobby.

                                  ELROD
                          (to passengers)
                    You all stay down and quiet!

      Elrod goes to the door, sees Bobby, clearly DEAD.  He then 
      looks up and through the BROKEN GLASS PANEL sees the 
        Construction Worker whose name is actually CUTTER (20s, mean, 
      scarred) approaching, holding a RIFLE.

      Elrod tries to OPEN THE DOOR USING THE LEVER, but he can t as 
      it s blocked by Bobby s DEAD BODY.

                                  ELROD (CONT D)
                      Goddammit.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    7.

      CUTTER, almost amused, LIGHTS UP A CIGARETTE.

                          (to the driver)
                    Move him.

                                  DRIVER
                    I got a bad back.

                                  ELROD
                    Lift with your legs.

      As the Driver awkwardly drags BOBBY S BODY out of the way --

      ON DEWEY

      peering over his seat, trying to get a look --

      ON THE DRIVER

      Finished moving Bobby.  Stumbles back into his seat.  As 
      Elrod steps forward and opens the door.

      Cutter steps aboard the bus.  He and Elrod take in BOBBY.

                                  CUTTER
                    You wanna grab the junk?  Or were 
                    you thinking we d stay awhile?

      ELROD reaches beneath Bobby s SEAT, extracts a GYM BAG --

      ON DEWEY

      now getting a good look at CUTTER.  And on Dewey s face is a 
      strange recognition: he knows this asshole...

      ON ELROD

      who opens the GYM BAG, peers inside --

      INSERT: The bag is full of PRESCRIPTION BOTTLES --

      Cutter takes a peek as well.  His face lights up.

                                  CUTTER (CONT D)
                    Looks like Christmas come early.

      But we go off of DEWEY, staring at them, his wheels spinning, 
      having to piss the last thing on his mind...

44INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - ART S OFFICE - DAY 

      Art is finishing up with Raylan and Tim.

                    the AUSA is gonna say the shooting 
                    of Jess Timmons was good.

                                  RAYLAN
                    No surprise there.  He had a gun to 
                    her pregnant belly.

      Tim and Raylan exchange a nod.  Tim goes.  Beat, then:

                                  RAYLAN
                    About what?

      Art kind of nods, towards Tim and the door.  Raylan realizes 
      what he s hinting at.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Oh, Christ.  He saw us, didn t he?
                          (then)
                    Listen, it s not a big deal.  Just 
                    two people, having a beer, seeing 
                    some music.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    9.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Goodbye, Art.

      Raylan turns to leave.  But Art grabs his coat, says:

                                  ART
                    I ll walk with you.  Something else 
                    you should hear.

      As Art and Raylan exit his office into --

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUSA5A5

      And continue the walk and talk...

                                  ART
                    Got a call right before you came in 
                    from Tom Bergen, State Trooper down 
                    in Harlan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Sure.  Helped us out on the Jimmy 
                    Earl Dean thing.

                                  ART
                    Well, one of his Troopers came 
                    across an abandoned church bus out 
                    on Glen Hollow Road.  Lone 
                    remaining passenger had a hole in 
                    his head the size of a .38 caliber 
                    bullet.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I ll be sure to steer clear of that 
                    church.

                                  ART
                    Shouldn t be a problem: apparently 
                    the  church  doesn t exist.  Bus 
                    was stolen.  And they found a 
                    receipt on the floor from a 
                      convenience store in Jacksonville, 
                    Florida.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (then)
                    They think it was an Oxy run?

                                  ART
                          (yup)
                    Probably on the return leg when it 
                    was hit by another set of 
                      criminals.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    11.

      As they exit the bullpen into --

      INT. MARSHALL S OFFICE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUSB5B5

      Where Raylan is hit with a revelation:

                                  RAYLAN
                    God dammit.

                                  ART
                    You think it was him?

                                  RAYLAN
                    What, you don t?

                                  ART
                    Thought you said he was playing it 
                    straight.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Wouldn t be the first time he said 
                    one thing and did another.  I ll 
                    call when I get down there.

      Raylan moves to leave.  Then, Art gets it:

                                  ART
                    Holy shit.  I just got it...
                          (then)
                    Winona.  You were out with Winona.

      Raylan stops, busted.  Art starts laughing.

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    And I thought sleeping with a 
                    witness was stupid--

                                  RAYLAN
                    It isn t like that.

                                  ART
                    I would love to hear what it is 
                    like.

                                  RAYLAN
                    And I d love to tell you, but my 
                    presence is needed down in Harlan.

                                  ART
                    Raylan, you are a thrill a minute, 
                    you know that?  We should sell 
                    tickets.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    12.

      Off Raylan, leaving, as Art just shakes his head...

55EXT. MINE - DAY 

      Where we find a number of MINE WORKERS done for the day. 
      Walking to their cars.  Among them is BOYD CROWDER.  He looks 
      tired, beat down.

      Then a guy named PRUITT (30s, sturdy, imposing) walks up 
      alongside Boyd.

                                  PRUITT
                    I ask you something, Crowder?

      Boyd looks to Pruitt.  Takes him in.  Keeps walking.  

                                  PRUITT (CONT D)
                    How d you manage to get this job?  
                    Because I heard of you, some of the 
                    things you done, and even though 
                    this ain t the most reputable 
                    operation in the world, seems to me 
                    they could do better than hiring an 
                    ex-con.

      Boyd just keeps going, tries to ignore him.  Pruitt puts a 
      hand on Boyd s shoulder, stopping him.  Boyd takes him in 
      coolly.  OTHER MINERS now stop, taking this in.

                                  PRUITT (CONT D)
                    You gonna answer me, or you just 
                    gonna stand there, look stupid?

      Boyd considers, then turns to go.  Pruitt s hand stays put.

                                  BOYD
                    Maybe you should ask the people who 
                    hired me.

                                  PRUITT
                    I d rather ask you.

      But Pruitt doesn t.  Standoff, it s about to go down, when:

                                  KYLE (O.C.)
                    Hey, Pruitt?

      Boyd and Pruitt look over, find another miner named KYLE, 
      30s, smart, tough.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    You ain t got cause for this.  
                    Leave him be.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    13.

        CONTINUED:55

      Pruitt looks from Kyle to Boyd, considers it, then walks off.  
      The other miners disperse.  Boyd and Kyle.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Spend all that time lookin  out for 
                    each other down below, only to come 
                    up top, start brawlin .

      Boyd is quiet, doesn t want to engage.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    I m Kyle.

                                  BOYD
                    Boyd.

                                  KYLE
                    I just started a few days ago.
                          (then)
                    How about you?  Been here long?

                                  BOYD
                    Not this go  round.

                                  KYLE
                    I was wondering, if you knew a 
                    place where a man might get a drink 
                    in a dry county?

                                  BOYD
                          (considers, then)
                    There s a bar in Cumberland.

                                  KYLE
                    Tell you what, I ll buy if you d 
                    like to join me.

                                  BOYD
                    Nothing personal Kyle, but I prefer 
                    to drink alone.

                                  KYLE
                    No problem.  Maybe some other time.

      And Boyd nods, walks off.  Kyle stands, watching him.  A 
      moment later, Pruitt and another guy we ll call MARCUS (30s) 
      slide up beside Kyle.  All watching Boyd.  Then, Kyle, not at 
      all the friendly guy he just sold himself as:

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Bit of a cold fish.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    14.

      Off Pruitt and Kyle, clearly closer than they just led us to 
      believe, something strange happening here...

      EXT. GLEN HOLLOW ROAD - DAYA6A6

      The BUS ROBBERY crime scene.  Raylan s taking it in with TOM 
      BERGEN, the State Trooper we met in 201.  

                                  TOM
                    Way I figure it, we got two tracks: 
                    Who was running this Oxy bus, and 
                    who robbed it.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Oh, Tom, I think I know who robbed 
                    it.  I just came to see the swath 
                    of destruction.

      Raylan sees where Bobby s body had been before it was hauled 
      off.  There s a lot of blood.  

                                  TOM
                    Question remains -- who was sending 
                    it through here to begin with?  The 
                    fella who was shot -- Bobby Lawton  
                    -- he s Frankfort, born and raised.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Home of the Dixie Mafia.

                                  TOM
                    Tracks about right.  You have any 
                      experience with that lot?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Little.  

      Their eyes are caught by a police car driving up.  DOYLE 
      BENNETT gets out, walks up to Raylan and Tom.

                                  DOYLE
                    Good day, gentlemen.

                                  RAYLAN/TOM
                    Doyle.  Chief.

                                  DOYLE
                    Quite a mess we got here.

                                  TOM
                    That it is.

      An awkward silence descends.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    15.

                    I know you two don t hold the local 
                    P.D.. in the highest regard, and I 
                    can t say I blame you after some of 
                    what s transpired down here.  But 
                    the last thing anyone wants is 
                    criminals stealing from criminals 
                    and people shooting at each other 
                    from pickup trucks.  So you all 
                    find anything, or need a hand, you 
                    let me know.

      Raylan and Tom nod, start to walk off.  Then:

                                  DOYLE (CONT D)
                          (to Raylan)
                    You planning on talking to Boyd 
                    Crowder about this?  It seems in 
                    his wheelhouse as they say.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That it does.

      They begin to walk again, when:

                                  DOYLE
                    Just out of curiosity, and I hope 
                    I m not crossing any line here, but 
                    how do you feel about his current 
                    living arrangement?

      Raylan furrows his brow, not sure what Doyle means.  Which to 
      Doyle, is delightful.

                                  DOYLE (CONT D)
                    You don t know?

      EXT. AVA S HOUSE - DAYA7A7

      Boyd lounges on the porch. As up to the house speeds Dewey s 
      CAR.  Stops.  Out steps Dewey, a man on a mission.

                                  DEWEY
                    How many Cutters you know?

                                  BOYD
                    And what is it you think I had him 
                    do?

                                  DEWEY
                    Rob the damn bus, whatta you think!

      Now AVA emerges onto the front porch.  Takes in the riff raff 
      causing all this racket.

                                  AVA
                    Well this figures.

                                  DEWEY
                    Oh, hey Ava.

                                  AVA
                          (to Boyd)
                    You ve got two minutes to get him 
                    outta here.

      And Ava s already headed back inside.

                                  DEWEY
                    Bye Ava.
                          (then, to Boyd)
                    She looks good as ever, huh?

                                  BOYD
                    Dewey, are you here because Cutter 
                    robbed your Oxy bus and you think 
                    I m responsible?

                                  DEWEY
                    I don t care that you robbed it 
                    Boyd, but I need that money.  These 
                    here are rock hard times for Dewey 
                    Crowe.

                                  BOYD
                    I had no hand in it.

                                  DEWEY
                    Why should I believe that?

      Boyd stares.  Dewey considers.  Frustrated.  Then, a thought:

                                  DEWEY (CONT D)
                    Alright.  If you didn t have a hand 
                    in it, I ll assume you won t mind 
                    if I make a play on my own behalf.

                                  BOYD
                    What re you thinkin , Dewey?

      Only takes a beat for Boyd to see it.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Don t.

                                  DEWEY
                    Don t what?

                                  BOYD
                    Don t go to Amber Holler and try to 
                    rob some robbers.

                                  DEWEY
                          (then, full of shit)
                    I wasn t gonna do that.

                    They ve probably already unloaded 
                    the goods by now.  And even if they 
                    haven t, they ll be on edge.  
                    High on their own stash.  You don t 
                    wanna walk into that--

                    Spoken like a man protecting his

                    Spoken like a man who doesn t wanna 
                    see you killed.

      Dewey starts off.  Boyd follows, trying to impart reason.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Those pills were someone s property 
                    before Cutter took  em.  And you 
                    can bet that someone will be down 
                    here in short order wanting them 
                    back.  You take  em off Cutter, 
                    you ll have two sets of angry 
                    killers scouring this Earth for you 
                    and that Oxy.

                                  DEWEY
                    I know you think I m stupid and 
                    weak.  But I ain t.

                                  BOYD
                    Gonna ask you one last time not to 
                    do this.

      Dewey considers it, but he can t pass up this chance.  Dewey 
      pulls loose, goes.  Off Boyd, hoping he doesn t end up with 
      Dewey s blood on his hands after all --

      EXT. AVA S HOUSE - DAYA8A8

      TIGHT ON A FRONT DOOR.  A knock.  A beat, and then it s 
      opened by AVA, pretty in a simple dress, no shoes.  She s a 
      bit thrown, as she realizes the man standing at her door --

      Is Raylan.  First time they ve seen each other since 
        Bulletville, and we should sense that.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hello, Ava.  Sorry to just show up 
                    like this, but I need a minute.

                    Okay.*

      Ava comes out, shuts the door behind her.*

                    What can I do for you, Raylan?*

                    Actually, I came to talk to Boyd.*

                    door to talk to Boyd, or to ask me *
                    why he s living in my house?*

                    much more than shitty memories and *
                    a balloon payment on a mortgage I *
                    can t afford.  I been working the *
                    beauty parlor in Corbin, but it *
                    ain t hardly enough.  Boyd helps *
                    out.  I know it s odd.  *

                    Ava.  Why I m here.  I m looking *

                      I wouldn t be standing here *

      Ava is at first going to yell.  But then she swallows it, *

      INT. CRASH PAD - DAY88

      A shithole in the middle of nowhere (*could be a trailer). 
      Cutter is emptying the pills from the INDIVIDUAL PRESCRIPTION 
      CONTAINERS into a single LARGE ZIPLOC BAG.  Elrod is watching 
      ANGEL THE DOG happily lick his own crotch.

                                  ELROD
                    You think I could manage to do 
                    that?

      Cutter stops what he s doing.  Looks at Elrod.  The dog.

                                  CUTTER
                    Sure, but you oughta pet him first.

      Elrod just looks at Cutter, confused.  As Cutter s CELL PHONE 
      RINGS.  He checks it.

                                  ELROD
                    That him?

      Cutter nods.

                    Leave it alone.

                    You really are ball-free, aren t

                    We got the pills, he don t.

      Cutter ANSWERS THE PHONE.  (*PRODUCTION NOTE: WE DO NOT HEAR 
      THE VOICE ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE)

                    We gotta talk.  There s a lot here. 
                    Much more than you said.
                          (then)

                          (then)
                    Think about it.  We could keep the 
                    pills, sell  em ourselves, make 20 
                    times that.

      But then Cutter swallows, as he s threatened brutally by the 
      voice on the other end.  Elrod shrugs -- what the fuck did I 
      just tell you?

                                  CUTTER (CONT D)
                    Alright, see you then.

      Cutter hangs up.  A beat.

                    What d he say?

                                  CUTTER
                    We could sell  em ourselves, but we

      INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - DAY1010

      A MANAGER, 50s, married, civil, is moving towards the front 
      door to lock up, when in comes --

        A breathless Dewey.  Sees the Manager coming at him.

                                    MANAGER
                    Sorry son, close up early on

                    take but a second.

      The Manager looks Dewey up and down.  Considers it.

                                    MANAGER
                    A ski mask.

                                  DEWEY
                    That s right.

                                    MANAGER
                    Son, this is Kentucky, what do you 
                    need a ski mask for?

                                  DEWEY
                    Who re you, ski mask police?  You 
                    have one or not?

                                    MANAGER
                    I don t have ski masks.  You might 
                    try a surplus store--

                                  DEWEY
                    They re the ones told me to come 
                    here!

                                    MANAGER
                    There s always eBay.

                                  DEWEY
                    eWhat?
                          (then)
                    It don t have to be a ski mask.  
                    You got a catcher s mask?  Or one 
                    of them hockey goalie masks, like 
                    the one from the slasher movie?

                                    MANAGER

                    in America no more?

                    You re welcome to buy anything you

      On Dewey, who s desperately SCANNING THE STORE, taking in the 
      VARIOUS SPORTS EQUIPMENT AND GEAR --

      Including the HUNTING RIFLES on the far wall, and beside 
      them, a MOUNTED DISPLAY OF STETSON HATS --

      He looks for just another moment, when Dewey Crowe has what 
      can only be described as a moment of divine inspiration, a 
      wide smile finding its way onto his face.

      INT. CRASH PAD - DAY1212

      It s dark, blinds drawn, just a hint of daylight poking 
      through.  Elrod and Cutter.  PILLS spread out on the table, 
      the two of them partying, having a good ol  time.

      Elrod has crushed up a pill.  Is calling to the DOG:

                                  ELROD
                    Angel baby, you come on over here.

                                  CUTTER
                    Elrod, you feed any of that shit to 
                    my dog we re gonna have a problem.

      Elrod s considering whether or not to keep going, when --

      DEWEY COMES CRASHING THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR, wearing his best 
       Raylan Costume  - jeans, boots, hat pulled down low - and 
      brandishing a REVOLVER.  He KILLS THE LIGHTS, YELLS:

                                  DEWEY
                    Federal Marshal!  Show me those 
                    hands and get on the goddamn 
                    ground!

      And Dewey, comic as we ve seen him, in this moment Dewey s 
      pretty fucking scary.

      Cutter and Elrod, off guard and afraid, have their hands in 
      the air, and do begin to get down on the ground --

      As the DOG SCURRIES BENEATH THE TABLE --

      As Dewey, FIRES A FEW TIMES, managing to TAKE OUT the LAMP at 
      the far end of the TRAILER --





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    25.

                    Face down!  Hands behind your head! 
                    I m US Marshal Raylan Givens and I 
                    will put a hole through ya if you 
                    make me!

      Dewey walks up to Cutter, who s trying to look over his 
      shoulder, HITS HIM ON THE HEAD WITH THE GUN.

      Elrod and Cutter, high on Oxy and pretty well terrified, stay 
      face down on the floor, hands behind their head.

      The DOG COWERING, STILL SCARED --

      As Dewey FRISKS each of them.  Finds a HANDGUN on Elrod, puts 
      it into his WAISTBAND.

                                  DEWEY (CONT D)
                    You boys think you re pretty smart, 
                    don t ya?  Well if you was, I 
                    wouldn t be standing here.  So you 
                    wanna tell me where the rest of 
                    them pills are at, or you wanna 
                    keep being smart?

                                  CUTTER
                    What pills--

      But Dewey FIRES A SHOT through the WINDOW, causing both MEN 
      to FLINCH and YELL.

                                  DEWEY
                    Outlaw life s hard, ain t it?  Now 
                    you gonna tell me, or am I gonna 
                    start putting bullets in places 
                    that bleed?

                                  ELROD
                    You can t do that.

                                  DEWEY
                    Hell I can t.  I m Federal Marshal 
                    Raylan Givens!  Don t nobody mess

                          (then)
                    The microwave.

      Cutter shoots Elrod a harsh gaze.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    26.

                    Either of you move it ll be the 
                    last mistake you ever make.

      As Dewey goes to the microwave, we re suddenly --

      ON A REVERSE POV with STEVIE, 20s, scared, hiding in the back 
      room.  She PEEKS around the door frame, watches Dewey go to 
      the kitchen.  And though the LIGHT shining in the KITCHEN 
      WINDOW she gets a look at him, especially the top of his NECK 
      TATTOO.  This clearly strikes her as odd, but she stays quiet 
      and still, and then we re --

      BACK WITH DEWEY, removing the PILLS from the microwave.  
      Paydirt.

                                  CUTTER
                    You have any idea who you re 
                    stealing from right now asshole?

                                  DEWEY
                    Hmm, well, let me see... is he a 
                    Federal Marshal, like I am?
                          (then)
                    Then I don t give a shit!

                                  CUTTER
                    You watch your back.  We ll see you 
                    again.

      Dewey now walks up to Cutter, KICKS HIM HARD right in the 
      gut.

                                  DEWEY
                    I see you either of you again, I m 
                    gonna put a hole through you.
                          (then, can t resist)
                    If I was you boys, I d give up this 
                    Oxy bullshit, go back to poaching 
                    gators, safer.

      And as Cutter and Elrod make eye contact, not sure what the 
      fuck just happened, Dewey hustles out of the trailer.

      as Raylan walks up and sits.  Boyd can t believe it: all he 
      wants to do is drink in peace.

                    taste of the local flavor?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Wish I had.  We did have some fun

                                  BOYD
                    Don t recall ever doing that.

                    Now why, considering the context of 
                    our last conversation, would you 
                    come asking me about that?  Because 
                    I thought I d made my intentions 
                    fairly clear--

                                  RAYLAN
                    Simple question Boyd.  Yes or no.

                                  BOYD
                    The real question, is will you 
                    believe my answer?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Why don t you give it a shot and 
                    we ll find out.

                          (then)
                    I had nothing to do with that bus 
                    being robbed.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Okay.  I believe you.
                          (then)
                    But that doesn t mean you don t 
                    know who did.

                                  BOYD
                          (smiles, then)
                    And what if I did?  Would I be 
                    obligated to tell you?

                                  RAYLAN
                    No.  You could always lie.

                          (then)
                    What would you have me do, Raylan?  
                    Be a snitch?  One of your 
                      informers?  Is that what you want?

      Raylan s PHONE RINGS.  Raylan checks it.  Looks back to Boyd.

C14C14EXT. CRASH PAD - DAY 

      Raylan and Doyle.  They re in mid-conversation.  Raylan can 
      vaguely make out someone in the back of Doyle s unit.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    So your C.I. was here when this guy 
                    came in and stole the pills from 
                    Cutter and Elrod?

                                  DOYLE
                    That s right.

                                  RAYLAN
                    And she got a good look at him.

                                  DOYLE
                    Yes she did...
                          (on Raylan: And?)
                    Raylan, you and me go back a long 
                    way.  We grew up around each other.  
                    Both come from families that have 
                    had their... issues with the law.  
                    And then, with all that in common, 
                    we both became lawmen.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (then)
                    I m sorry, what are we talking 
                    about?

                                  DOYLE
                          (smiling)
                    See, I got to thinking: maybe 
                    Raylan isn t the man I thought he 
                    was.  Maybe he isn t the man anyone 
                    thinks he is.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Was that supposed to be an answer?

                                  DOYLE
                    I m saying, sometimes a man does 
                      something, and certain folks might 
                    see it as wrong.  Others, they 
                    might embrace it.  Hell, they might 
                    even be in a position to help that 
                    man out, provided the favor gets 
                    returned later.

                    Are you speaking Martian?  Doyle, 
                    is there any way you could just say 
                    what it is you re trying to say?

                                  DOYLE
                    I know you took those pills, 
                    Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I did what now?

                                  DOYLE
                    You probably thought Cutter and 
                    Elrod would never tell anyone.  And 
                    they didn t.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You re having fun with me, right?

                    Raylan Givens busted in, hat and 
                    all, and stole the pills at

                    I don t know you, Raylan.  You

                    And what was all that shit you were

                                  RAYLAN
                    That s what that was, huh.  Not 
                    like the way one drug user tries to 
                    see if the man he s just met is 
                    carrying?

                          (to Stevie)
                    Would you describe him for me, 
                    Stevie?  Man who took the pills?

                                  STEVIE
                    Well, he was smaller, kinda 
                    scrawny.  Had a neck tattoo peekin  
                    up outta his shirt, and I never 
                    seen a lawman with a tattoo on his 
                    neck.  Made some strange comments 
                    too.  One at the end about poaching 
                    gators.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Poaching gators?

                      I remember it cause it didn t make 
                    no sense at all.

      And this detail combined with everything else, suddenly it 
      hits Raylan like a ton of bricks.

                    I ll be damned.

      Through the door comes Dewey.  Still on a rush from having 
      pulled off the job.  He immediately sees Ellen May.  Goes 
      right at her.

                    Ellen May.  Why don t you grab a

      Dewey produces a COUPLE PILLS from his pocket, hands them 
      over.  Ellen May examines them, then, delighted:

                    Oh.  I m good either way.

      And Ellen May, smile on her face, walks off.  Dewey then 
      spots Boyd at the bar.  Goes to him.  Sits.  Boyd s already 
      seen Dewey, knows exactly what this is.

      ELLEN and and the other girl, each down to bra and underwear, 
      high as hell.  Also there is Dewey, King for a Day, wearing 
      underwear, boots, gator necklace and Stetson Hat.  Ellen May 
      and the other girl KISS.

                                  DEWEY
                    That is just about the best thing I 
                    ever laid eyes on.

                                  ELLEN
                          (putting the HAT ON)
                    I always knew you d be a good time, 
                    Dewey Crowe.

                                  DEWEY
                    That s right, gonna be nothing but 
                    good times from here on in.  Now 
                    why don t you two kiss a little 
                    more so I can watch.

      Dewey is so excited he s about to burst.  As Ellen May and 
      the Girl go to kiss each other, when suddenly --

      A POUNDING ON THE DOOR.  WTF?

                                  DEWEY (CONT D)
                    This here s a private party!

                                  RAYLAN (O.C.)
                    It s Raylan, Dewey.  Open up.

      Dewey takes this in, shattered.

                                  DEWEY
                          (changing his voice)
                    Ain t no one by that name in here!

                                  RAYLAN (O.C.)
                    To the two young ladies who are 
                    also in the trailer, this is U.S. 
                    Marshal Raylan Givens, and unless 
                    you want to go to jail I suggest 
                    one of you opens up that door.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    37.

      CONTINUED:1818

      Ellen May moves to the door.  Dewey doesn t move to stop her. 
      As the other GIRL covers herself, Ellen May opens the door --

      And there s RAYLAN.  Taking in the scene before him.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    This looks like quite the party. 
                    You mind if I come in?

                                  DEWEY
                    Hell yes we do.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (to Ellen May)
                    Ma am?

                                  ELLEN MAY
                    If you got cause.

      Raylan enters as Ellen May now moves away and covers herself 
      as well.  Raylan takes in Dewey, half naked.  Yikes.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I always figured you for a special 
                    kind of idiot, Dewey Crowe.  But 
                    what you have done in the past 12 
                    hours is light years ahead of any 
                    stupidity even I thought you were 
                    capable of.

                                  DEWEY
                    I don t know what you mean.

      Raylan now holds up a bag of PILLS.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You left these in your trunk.

      Tosses him the bag.  Dewey catches it.  Stunned.

                                  DEWEY
                    Don t you remember, Marshal?  You 
                    deputized me.  I was just seizing 
                     em for you.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That s good - I am impressed, 
                    Dewey.  And I assume you were 
                    planning on telling me right after 
                    you finished up here, that it?

                                  DEWEY
                    That s right.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    38.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Put your clothes on.  Party s over.

      Dewey now approaches Raylan, who inches back, extremely 
      uncomfortable being this close to an almost naked Dewey.

                                  DEWEY
                    Raylan, please, I m begging you: 
                    just give me five more minutes, and 
                    I ll do whatever you want.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You serious?

      Dewey holds up FIVE FINGERS.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Dewey, I heard within five minutes 
                    you were handing out pills.  How 
                    long you think it s gonna take the 
                    men you robbed to hear the same 
                    thing?
                          (then)
                    Clothes.  Now.

      As Dewey realizes it s over, he grudgingly begins to put his 
      clothes on.  Raylan goes to the trailer door, just to make 
      sure they re in the clear.  So far so good.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    While I m waiting, you mind telling 
                    me who hired you to go on that bus 
                    ride in the first place?

      Dewey eyes the girls.  Raylan gets it.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    If you re worried about looking 
                    like less than a man, I think that 
                    ship has sailed.

                                  DEWEY
                          (then)
                    Bobby Lawton.  He got killed.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You deal with anyone above him?

      Dewey just shakes his head.  Raylan s considering this, as 
      from the doorway he sees --





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    39.

      CONTINUED: (3)1818

      Elrod and Cutter walking around the side of Audry s back up 
      towards the trailer.  And they do not look happy --

      ON RAYLAN.  Shit.  He pulls his BADGE, and from the doorway:

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Boys, U.S. Marshal!  I m gonna ask 
                    you to stop right there and put 
                    your hands where I can see  em.

                                  CUTTER
                    We ain t falling for that shit 
                    again.

      As Elrod and Cutter both PULL GUNS and START SHOOTING --

      As RAYLAN PULLS HIS GUN, FIRING BACK, as he FALLS INTO THE 
      TRAILER and SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT --

                                  RAYLAN
                    Down!

      As EVERYONE HITS THE DECK, BULLETS RIP THROUGH THE TRAILER 
      ALL AROUND THEM.  Raylan raises himself up to the WINDOW, 
      BREAKS IT, THEN FIRES A FEW SHOTS OFF --

      Which send Elrod and Cutter running for COVER --


                                  END OF ACT THREE    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    40.


                                        ACT FOUR

      INT./EXT. TRAILER - DAY1919

      Raylan reloads, looks at Dewey.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Well you wanted to be Raylan 
                    Givens, here s your chance: go get 
                     em.

      On Dewey, not sure whether or not Raylan is serious.  Raylan 
      peeks out the window, sees --

      Elrod and Cutter trying to ADVANCE on the trailer.  Raylan 
      FIRES, sending them both SCRAMBLING back to their COVER.

      Raylan considers, then, YELLING OUT THE SHOT-OUT WINDOW: 
        (*Throughout this, we will continue to CUT BACK AND FORTH 
      between Raylan and Cutter and Elrod.)

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Would you both stop shooting long 
                    enough so s I can have a word with 
                    you?
                          (then)
                    By now I m sure you ve figured out 
                    it wasn t Raylan Givens that robbed 
                    you.  But the person who did do it 
                    is in here with me right now, as 
                    are the pills that he took from 
                    you. That s the bad news.  But the 
                    worse news is that I actually am 
                    Raylan Givens, so right now you re 
                    trying to kill a US Marshal, which 
                    no jury is going to take kindly to.

      Elrod and Cutter both take this in.  Shit.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Now, I know you want your pills and 
                    the guy who took  em, and to be 
                    honest I m tempted to give him to 
                    you.  But unfortunately I can t, so 
                    I can only offer you a deal: put 
                    down your guns and let me take you 
                    in.  Then, you give me some idea of 
                    who recruited you to rob that Oxy 
                    shipment in the first place, and I 
                    can promise that the D.A. will go 
                    easier on you for killing Bobby.  
                                  (MORE)




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    41.

                    Or you can keep shooting, and in 
                    two minutes when the cavalry 
                    arrives you ll either be killed, or 
                    arrested and offered a deal much 
                    less sweet than what I m offering.

      Off RAYLAN, who knows if they re not shooting, he must be 
      reaching them --

      ON ELROD AND CUTTER.  Considering it.

                                  CUTTER
                    You wanna be a snitch?

                                  ELROD
                    I don t wanna be dead.

      Then, DOYLE appears behind them both, gun held high.

                                  DOYLE
                    Either of you move I ll kill you.
                          (then)
                    Put the guns down, hands where I 
                    can see  em.

      Off Cutter and Elrod, knowing they re fucked --

      TO RAYLAN, who peeks out, sees Doyle.  Gets to his feet --

      TO DOYLE, speaking quietly with Elrod and Cutter.

                                  DOYLE (CONT D)
                    You two get one shot at this: tell 
                    me who hired you to hit that bus.

                                  CUTTER
                    You honestly don t know?
                          (then)
                    It was your brother, Dickie.

                                  DOYLE
                    Yeah, that s what I thought.

      Off Doyle, considering this, we go to --

      RAYLAN, struggling to get a good look at what s going on out 
      there.  Then he HEARS:

                                  DOYLE  (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    Don t do it!

      Followed closely by FOUR GUNSHOTS.  Raylan busts out the 
      TRAILER DOOR --



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    42.

      CONTINUED: (2)1919

      Sees Doyle moving to the BODIES, KICKING their guns away, 
      watching coldly as Cutter and Elrod take their last breaths.

      Raylan moves to them, gun still drawn.

                                  DOYLE (CONT D)
                    Must a thought I was kidding when I 
                    told them to put down their guns.

      As Raylan goes from Elrod to Cutter, both of them already 
      DEAD and GONE.  Doyle holsters his weapon and moves away, 
      already pulling out his phone to call this in.  Off Raylan, 
      staring at these bodies, and then Doyle, on his phone...

Aa21Aa21INT. DICKIE S TRAILER - NIGHT 

      Coover and Dickie are sitting on the couch.  Coover takes a 
      bong rip.  Holds it.  Then, coughs mightily.  Dickie looks 
      over from the t.v., shaking his head.

                                  DICKIE
                    All that you smoke and you still 
                    just can t help yourself, huh?

                    I m under some serious stress here.  
                    Don t know why you re so calm.

    A beat.  Then, Dickie s PHONE RINGS.  He checks it.  Looks to 
      Coover, a little confused.

                                  COOVER (CONT D)
                    Who is it?

                    But... the news said Cutter was 
                    dead...

      Dickie gives Coover a look, answers the call:

                                  DICKIE

      The three brothers out in the night.

                    hired Cutter and Elrod to jack that

      Coover and Dickie take this in, clearly busted.

      Ava is sitting out on her porch.  Raylan coming towards her.

                    Twice in the same day.  Lucky me.*

                    Assuming you re still looking for *
                    Boyd?

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, I found him.

                    You throw him in jail?*

                                  RAYLAN
                    I d imagine he s down that mine *
                    working his shift as per usual.

                                  AVA
                    So he didn t rob that bus after

                          (on Raylan: nope)*
                    And you came here just to tell me *
                    that?

                                  RAYLAN
                      Considering your and Boyd s living *

                    throw him out because of something *

                    Listen, there are plenty of ways to *

                    This has nothing to do with you, *

                    figure otherwise.*

                                    RAYLAN*
                    Then why?  Why invite even the *

                    bring into your home?*

                                  AVA*
                    I already told you--*

                    Yeah, I know, you need rent money *
                    and he s your kin.  Call me *
                    arrogant if you want but I don t *
                    buy it.*

                                  AVA*
                    And maybe I believe Boyd can *
                    change, that he just needs help.*

                                    RAYLAN*

      As Ava heads inside.*

      INT. BAR - CUMBERLAND - DAY2222

      Boyd, posted up at the bar in Cumberland where he had a drink 
      with Raylan in 202.  It s late morning, very quiet, almost no 
      one else in the place.  Boyd has come straight from his shift 
      and he s drunk, conflicted, tightly wound when --

      Coming at him from down the bar is Kyle.  Pruitt and Marcus 
      sit a few seats away.  Boyd can t believe it.

                                  KYLE
                    Well whatta you know?  Boyd 
                    Crowder.  Fancy that.

                                  BOYD
                          (almost to himself)
                    I wonder what a man must do to have 
                    a quiet drink in these parts.

      Kyle extracts FIVE DOLLARS, slides it to the Bartender.

                                  KYLE
                    Bourbon, please.

                                  BOYD
                    I thought I d made it fairly clear 
                    that I prefer to drink alone.

                                  KYLE
                    You did.  And I respect that, I do.  
                    But I have something to offer you, 
                    was hoping maybe we could help each 
                    other out.

      The Bartender comes by, sets Kyle s drink down.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                      I probably should have just come 
                    clean at the mine, but the truth is 
                    I know who you are Boyd, and I 
                    admire all that you done.
                          (then)
                    I mean, Crowder s Commandos?  Shit 
                    brother, you re a local legend.  
                    Killing Jews like you was in a 
                    video game--

                                  BOYD
                    I never killed any Jews, Kyle.  In 
                    fact, I don t believe I ve ever met 
                    a Jew in my life.

      Boyd finishes his drink.  Begins to leave cash.

                                  KYLE
                    All I m trying to say is I 
                      understand all that you done.  You 
                    had a vision.  Well, I have a 
                    vision too, Boyd.  You and me, 
                    we re the same--

      But now Boyd is up from his seat.  Kyle quickly moves to 
      block his path.  A beat.

                                  BOYD
                    You know nothing about me, or why 
                    I ve done the things that I have.

                                  KYLE
                    Ain t nothing to be ashamed of 
                    Boyd.  I killed people, too.  I ve 
                    lost friends, just like you did out 
                    in those woods.  But that 
                      sacrifice, it s necessary.  Men 
                    like you and me understand that.

      follows Boyd, as do Pruitt and Marcus from the mine.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Oh come on, Crowder...

      As Boyd exits the bar, all three men are not far behind him --

      EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS2323

      Boyd walks towards his TRUCK (both his WINDOWS have been left 
      down).  Kyle and his friends continue to follow.

                                  KYLE
                    No need to run off.

      But Boyd, ignoring him, opens his CAR DOOR.  Gets in.  Shuts 
      the door behind him, and now we re --

2424INT./EXT. BOYD S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS - DAY 

      As Boyd starts the ignition.  Just as Kyle reaches the truck, 
      and REACHES across Boyd to TURN OFF THE IGNITION.

                                  KYLE
                    Hear me out, just two more minutes, 
                    that s all I m asking--

      And in this moment all the anger Boyd s been ignoring, all 
      the pain that has been roiling down deep inside, finally 
      BOILS OVER.  He GRABS Kyle around the NECK with one arm, as 
      he throws the TRUCK INTO REVERSE WITH THE OTHER --

                                  BOYD
                    You wanna talk some more, Kyle?  
                    Fine, you come on with me, we ll 
                    have us some one-on-one time.

      And Boyd quickly BACKS UP, then throws the car into DRIVE, 
      and PULLS OUT ONTO THE ROAD.

      Kyle is pissed off and scared, trying with all his might to 
      shake loose.  His friends try to grab him, but Kyle s quickly 
      out of reach, as he SCRAMBLES TO KEEP UP WITH THE 
        ACCELERATING TRUCK.

                                  KYLE
                    Oh, shit!

      But Boyd is holding tight; there s no shaking loose.

                                  BOYD
                    You wanna hear about my past?  How 
                    I blew shit up, killed people, got 
                    people killed?  That what you re 
                      interested in?

      And now they re out on the open road --

      The SPEEDOMETER AT 25 MILES AN HOUR --

      A FIRE IN BOYD S EYES --

                                  KYLE
                    Stop the car, Boyd!

      As Kyle s FEET BEGIN TO DRAG, and now he s gone from trying 
      to wriggle free to trying to HOLD ON with all his might.

      But Boyd s not stopping.  In fact, he continues to SPEED UP --

      THE SPEEDOMETER now CROSSING 30, to 35 --

                                  BOYD
                    Or, maybe you d like to talk about 
                    God.  About religion, that it?

                                  KYLE
                    Jesus Christ, Boyd--


                                  BOYD
                    You want to talk about Jesus?  You 
                    want to meet him, maybe?
                          (then)
                        WHHHHHEEEEEEEHHHHHAAAAWWWW!!!

      And Boyd, unleashing this YELL, all his fires burning, the 
      SPEEDOMETER at 40, RELEASES KYLE --

      Who GOES TUMBLING ACROSS THE PAVEMENT, HEAD OVER HEELS, the 
      kind of fall that could kill a man.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    50.

      ON BOYD, as the truck moves down the road, his adrenaline 
      pumping, his eyes still wild with the thrill of the moment.

      But a few beats and Boyd s breathing slows.  His smile fades.  
      He STOPS THE TRUCK.  Cranes out the window, where he sees --

      KYLE, lying motionless on the road --

      ON BOYD, taking in what he just did.  He then turns the 
      wheel, starts to go back to help Kyle, when --

      KYLE MOVES.  Slowly and painfully, but he s moving.  Manages 
      to sit up, holding his arm, banged up but alive.  Not too far  
      away, Pruitt and Marcus are jogging up the road towards him --

      ON BOYD, who reconsiders, straightens out the wheel, and 
      continues on down the empty road.
