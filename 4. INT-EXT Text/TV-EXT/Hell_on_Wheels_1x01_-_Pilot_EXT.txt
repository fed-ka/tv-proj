        Soldier walks down street.  Some early morning foot traffic.  
      He heads up the steps of St. Matthews Cathedral.


      The train chugs through stunning, big sky country.

        OMIT1212


        Cullen standing outside the car, hanging on, surrounded by 
      other workers.  Train lurches to a stop.  Cullen steps off. 

      All of the following is seen from his P.O.V...

        A BLACK POWDER EXPLOSION

        DEAFENING.  Blowing up an outcropping of rocks.  Black smoke 
      and debris blown skyward.  

        Cullen is joined by a flock of Irish workers from the train; 
      they seem intimidated by the violent incident.  Cullen calmly 
      takes it in; his eyes have seen much worse.

      The LOUD RHYTHMIC MUSIC of hammers on spikes rings out, as a 
      SQUAD OF TRACK LAYERS fastens the rail to the ties.  

      The ringing of the hammers gives way to the sound of 
        SQUEALING PIGS.  Cullen turns...                                                                                      11.


        A pack of pigs is herded from one of the other cars.  Coming 
      from the same car, a group of FREEDMEN hustle out among the 
        squealing pigs.  

        A TEAMSTER delivers rail to the track layers on a horse drawn 
      cart.  As soon as the cart ahead is emptied, it is tipped on 
      its side to clear room for the next cart.

        Graders and cut crews dig with picks and hammers, shaping and 
        leveling the ground for the road bed.  The air is thick with 
      dust.  

        Cullen navigates his way through the bedlam, his intense eyes 
        taking in everything...

        A buffalo is being slaughtered in a slaughtering pen adjacent 
      to the tracks.  Nearby, buffalo hides hang, tanning in the 
        blistering sun.  

      Trees adjacent to a river bank being cut down.  Carpenters 
        sawing and planing the trunks into railroad ties.

      This is a battle between man and nature.  And nature is 
        losing.

        Cullen walks toward a series of tents...

      One is a makeshift hospital tent.  Front flap open.  Cullen 
      sees the injured and sick inside.  This is hard, dangerous 
      work.

      Men lined up outside the other tents, seeking employment.  He 
      walks toward these tents. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


      Not far from the railroad, the EXPLOSIONS can be heard.  
      Black smoke can be seen above the hills.

        A SMALL CONGREGATION has gathered on the banks to witness a 
        baptism.  The worshippers, mainly the old and young, sing a 
      hymn -- Pass Me Not O Gentle Savior.

                                    HYMN
                      Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
                      Hear my humble cry;
                      While on others Thou art calling,
                    Do not pass me by. 

        REVEREND NATHANIEL COLE leads JOSEPH BLACK MOON into the 
        water.                                                                                        12.


      Maybe twenty years old, Joseph is a full blooded Cheyenne 
        Indian.  He wears a stiff suit; his blue-black hair is shorn 
      in a severe bowl cut.

      With his long white hair and beard, Cole is a ringer for John 
        Brown.  He has the energy of a man forty years his junior.  
      The hymn continues.

                                    REVEREND COLE
                      Jesus, accept this humble servant 
                      into your heart...

      As Joseph wades out with Reverend Cole, his eyes dart around 
      at the surroundings.

        JOSEPH S POV-- the wind rustling the tops of the trees.  The 
        clouds scuttling across the sky.  The river flowing, then...

      An eagle soaring high overhead.  

        Joseph s eyes widen slightly at the portentous sight.  

        Reverend Cole, pinches Joseph s nose with his fingers, then 
      dunks him backwards into the water.  

                                    REVEREND COLE (CONT D)
                    Be reborn in the glory of Jesus!  
                      Brother Joseph, your sins are *
                      washed away!

      He retrieves a gasping Joseph from the water.  Joseph s eyes 
      scan the skies for the eagle but it is gone.  The hymn 
        continues. 


        Johnson sits a skittish horse.  Cullen stands at his side. 

        A work gang made up of the TWENTY FREEDMEN stand opposite. 
      All of them with dark black skin, except one...

      ELAM JEFFERSON.  Separated from them not only by skin color, 
      but by a certain intense look in his eyes.

        Johnson nods towards Cullen.

                                    JOHNSON
                      This is Mister Bohannon, your 
                      walking boss. You will address him 
                    as boss or boss man or walking 
                      boss.                                                                                         15.


      An explosion goes off in the distance.  Johnson steadies his 
        horse.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      Mr. Bohannonis a former master of 
                      slaves...

        ON ELAM -- Shake of his head.  Wry smile.   

                                    ELAM
                            (sotto)
                      Some things never change.

      One of the other slaves, WILLIAM, stands next to him.  He 
        smiles slightly.

                                    JOHNSON
                      ...So he s up to your tricks.  He s 
                      gonnawork the blue outayour gums, 
                      boys.  Any coffee boilers and 
                      otherwise slack work ethic will be 
                      dealt with severely.  Now dig me a 
                      cut!

      The freedmen commence digging in the hardscrabble earth.  
        Johnson turns to Cullen.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      Meet me at the saloon for a drink 
                      tonight.  We ll talk about old 
                      times.

        Cullen surveys the area with a puzzled look.

                                    CULLEN
                      What saloon?

        Johnson scans the horizon.  Points.

                                    JOHNSON
                      That one.  

        Cullen follows Johnson s finger.


        A cluster of tents has already been erected.  More going up. 

        A hasty, hand-painted, wooden Hell on Wheels sign has been 
      put up.  POPULATION: One Less Every Day.

        A frenetic, whirling dervish of activity.                                                                                       16.


        PROSTITUTES cavort and carry on.  Crates of whiskey and 
        barrels of beer are offloadedfrom the wagons.   

      More wagons speed to their appointed destinations.  People 
        scatter to avoid being trampled.  

        Reverend Cole drives his own wagon into the melee. Joseph 
      sits next to him.  Cole stops the wagon.  

                                    REVEREND COLE
                      Right here!  Unload the tent!  
                      Raise the church!

      One of the prostitutes watches with amusement.

                                      PROSTITUTE
                      You re putting up a church here?

                                    REVEREND COLE
                      What better place to convert the 
                      wicked, sister?*

                                      PROSTITUTE
                      Keep an eye on your flock, 
                      reverend. We do our own share of 
                      converting around here.

      She winks, spits out a jet of brown tobacco juice and smiles, 
        revealing a set of crud-coated teeth.

      CLOSE ON JOSEPH -- taking in the commotion of the small 
        metropolis.

      From the raucous NOISE AND ENERGY of Hell On Wheels...


        Absolute silence on the cut.  River runs through stunning 
        scenery.  Dramatic, grass covered bluff.

                                    LILY BELL S VOICE
                      The charmed sunset linger dlow 
                      adown.  In the red West thro 
                      mountain clefts the dale was seen 
                      far inland.

      The pristine landscape looks untouched by man, until we 
        see...

        A TEAM OF SURVEYORS toiling along the river bank. 

        A series of red stakes stretches towards the eastern horizon, 
        marking the path of the oncoming railroad.                                                                                      17.


                                    LILY BELL S VOICE (CONT D)
                      And round about the keel with faces 
                      pale...

      LILY BELL is seated on a folding stool.  She reads from a 
        well-worn volume of Tennyson.  Her husband, ROBERT BELL, sits 
        nearby, writing in a notebook.  He muffles an intermittent 
      cough with a handkerchief as he writes.

                                    LILY
                      Dark faces, pale against that rosy 
                      flame, the mild-eyed melancholy 
                        Lotos-eaterscame. 

      She closes the book.  Lily and Robert sit in silence as Lily 
      takes in the stunning scene. Robert looks up from his 
        notebook.

                                    LILY (CONT D)
                      This land, it s bewitching.  

                                    ROBERT
                      It s just as Lewis and Clark saw it 
                      sixty years ago.

      Lily sighs, continuing to take in the view.

                                    LILY
                    Do you ever wonder if our laying 
                      out the course of the railroad will 
                    be the ruin of all of this?

        Sweeping gesture at the land.

                                    ROBERT
                      Progress comes with a cost, Lily.

                                    LILY
                      I know.  I just think it s so much 
                      more beautiful without... people.

                                    ROBERT
                      Don t fool yourself; there are 
                      plenty of people here.  

      She looks at him.

                                    ROBERT (CONT D)
                      We re entering Cheyenne territory.  
                    Do you remember our agreement?

                                    LILY
                      Which agreement is that?                                                                                      18.


                                    ROBERT
                      Don t play dumb, Lily.  It doesn t 
                      suit you.  Stubborn, yes but not 
                      dumb. 

      He coughs into his handkerchief.

                                    LILY
                      Oh, you mean our agreement 
                      regarding my not leaving your side 
                      while you re sick?

        Robert closes his notebook.  Goes to Lily.

                                    ROBERT
                      No.  I meant our agreement that you 
                      would go back to Chicago as soon as 
                    we entered hostile Indian 
                      territory.  

                                    LILY
                      But that was before you took ill.  
                      I think the second agreement 
                      supersedes the first.

                                    ROBERT
                      Dear God, now you sound like a 
                      lawyer.

      She takes Robert s hands in hers.  

                                    LILY
                    If you want me to go back to 
                      Chicago, lead the way. I m not 
                      leaving you, Robert. 

                                    ROBERT
                      Don t tempt me.  I might just do 
                      it.

      Lily smiles.

                                    LILY
                      Now you re playing me for dumb. 
                      You ve dreamed about this for too 
                      long to go back now. 

                                    ROBERT
                        We vedreamed about it.  

        Finally, he puts his arms around her.                                                                                      19.


                                    ROBERT (CONT D)
                      This would mean nothing to me if 
                      you weren t here to share it.

      He pulls her closer.  He loves the way she feels.  He 
        breathes in the scent of her hair.  Lily s expression 
        changes.

                                    LILY
                      Robert Bell!  You rascal. Are you 
                      hiding something in your trousers?

        Robert smiles rakishly.

                                    ROBERT
                    It must be this fresh air.  

      Now Lily smiles.

                                    LILY
                      Then breathe deeply my dear.  

      SLOW ZOOM AWAY from Robert and Lily on the hilltop until they 
      are specks again.  They are being watched by...

        REVEAL two Cheyenne Indians -- PAWNEE KILLER and SUN BEAR -- 
      lying atop the bluff, secreted by boulders. They wear only 
        breechcloths, leggings and moccasins.  Their long hair is 
        braided with a top knot in the shape of a pompadour.  

      With their sun-burnt skin, their high cheek bones and 
        epicanthic eyes, they look almost like they could be from 
        another planet than that of the white people below.


                                    END OF ACT TWO                                                                                      20.


                                        ACT THREE


      Men stagger and stumble around on the streets, blind drunk.  
        Others already passed out in the muck.  Gaunt dogs roam the 
        street, sniffing at the passed out drunks.

      Lit by torches, Hell on Wheels is fully assembled and in full 
        swing.  Saloons, gambling tents, a dance hall, a whorehouse 
      and some legitimate businesses.  But mainly it is vice 
        unbridled.  

        A sign on the periphery reads: HELL ON WHEELS.  POPULATION: 
      ONE LESS EVERY DAY.


      The eastern sky glows faintly. 


      The muck is littered with passed out bodies and empty whiskey 
        bottles.  Some men stagger out into the dim light.A TRAIN *
        WHISTLE SUDDENLY SOUNDS, LOUD AND PIERCING.*                                                                                      22.



      THE WHISTLE CONTINUES. The side of a Casement car slides open *
      and men begin to emerge from their bunks. They greet the day 
        stretching, scratching their asses, yawning, coughing, 
        blowing snotrockets, pissingand farting.  A symphony of 
        bodily functions.

      Other men fall to their knees -- no not to pray -- but to 
      throw up last night s whiskey.  


      The freedmen labor under the hot sun.  The shovels and picks 
      beat out a staccato rhythm.  They are digging a channel 
        through a rocky hill, making room for the railroad bed.                                                                                        25.


      Many of the men are tiring and gasping for breath in the 
        scorching weather.  The dust is relentless.  

        Cullen walks the line, shouting encouragement.  

                                    CULLEN
                      Come on!  Put your backs into it!

      He checks his pocket watch. 

                                    CULLEN (CONT D)
                      Half an hour till lunch!  Pick it 
                      up!   

      Elam and WILLIAM, another freedman work shoulder to shoulder.

                                    ELAM
                      Peckerwood.

                                    WILLIAM
                    He ain t so bad.

                                    ELAM
                      Shut your dumb black ass up.  I 
                      don t need no slave boss motivatin 
                      me.

      Elam swings his pick, attacking the hardscrabble ground with 
        gusto.  There is an anger, a violence, to his movements.   

                                    CULLEN
                      Gimmethe full chisel, boys!

      Elam shoots a look at Cullen.

                                    ELAM
                          (to William)
                      Help me out here.

      Elam starts singing a call-and-answer work song.

                                    ELAM (CONT D)
                      All dempurtygals will be dar!

        William and the other ex-slaves look up at Elam.

                                    ELAM (CONT D)
                      Come on!  I said all dempurtygals 
                      will be dar!

      Some of the freedmen join in the response.

                                    FREEDMEN 
                      Shuck datcorn before you eat!                                                                                      26.


                                    ELAM
                      They will fix it for us rare!

      A few more join in.

                                    FREEDMEN
                      Shuck datcorn before you eat!

      The workers pick up their pace.  Cullen starts to say 
        something but Elam shouts over him, drowning Cullen s voice 
      out.

                                    ELAM
                      I hope dey llhave some whiskey 
                      dar!

                                    FREEDMAN
                      Shuck datcorn before you eat!

      Elam continues the call and response.  He and Cullen make eye 
        contact.  The message from Elam is,  I m the boss here, not 
      you. 


        A huge full moon hangs in the sky.  

      Five tents stand in a clearing.  Some of the tents are lit 
      from the inside, making them look like Japanese lanterns.


      Three figures sit atop horses on a promontory in the fading 
        light:  Joseph, his father, CHIEF MANY HORSES, and his 
        brother PAWNEE KILLER. Joseph dressed in his  white man s  
        clothes.  Many Horses and Pawnee Killer in Cheyenne 
        buckskins.

        Pawnee Killer is really worked up; his horse circles and 
        stomps.                                                                                      28.


                                    MANY HORSES 
                      I m sure we can come to an 
                      agreement with the white men.  Look 
                      out there...

      Many Horses makes a sweeping gesture at the pristine, empty 
      land that stretches to the horizon all around them.

                                    MANY HORSES (CONT D)
                      ...somuch good land.  Enough for 
                      everyone.  

                                    JOSEPH
                      It s not just the railroad, father.  
                      Towns will be built.  Ranches.  
                      Farms.  They ll need land and 
                      water.  Their cattle will need to 
                      graze in the pasture of the 
                      buffalo. There s nothing we can do 
                    to stop it...

                                    PAWNEE KILLER
                      I say we fight the bastards.

        Joseph turns to Pawnee Killer.

                                    JOSEPH
                    In the name of Jesus Christ I ask 
                      you to put down your weapons and 
                      submit.

        Pawnee Killer scoffs.

                                    PAWNEE KILLER 
                      This man Jesus was weak.  He let 
                      them whip him and nail him to that 
                      strange tree so that he died.

                                    JOSEPH
                    He died for our sins.

                                    PAWNEE KILLER 
                      I ll die for my own sins, little 
                      brother.

                                    JOSEPH 
                      You willdie.  Make no mistake 
                      about it. 

                                    PAWNEE KILLER 
                      There are some things worse than 
                      dying,   hmo' htavaestse.  All you 
                      need do is look in a mirror.                                                                                      29.


        Suddenly, Joseph has his horse up close against Pawnee 
        Killer s.  Looks him in the eye.

                                    JOSEPH
                      I m not scared to die. But I don t 
                      want to watch my people 
                        slaughtered.

        Pawnee Killer looks Joseph up and down disdainfully.

                                    PAWNEE KILLER
                       Your people?   Look at you...

        Pawnee Killer flits at Joseph s hair; Joseph snatches hold of 
      his wrist, suddenly pissedoff. 

      In a flash, Pawnee Killer unsheathes his knife with his other 
      hand and has it at Joseph s throat.  No fear in Joseph s 
      eyes, just anger.

                                    PAWNEE KILLER (CONT D)
                            (smiles)
                      So, this Jesus hasn t taken your 
                      balls away completely.

                                    MANY HORSES
                      That s enough!

      Their eyes turn to their father.  Another beat, then Pawnee 
        Killer lowers his knife; Joseph finally releases his 
        brother s arm.  

                                    PAWNEE KILLER
                      You re right.  Enough  talk. 

      With that, Pawnee Killer heels his horse and rides away in a 
      cloud of dust.  Many Horses watches him go.

                                    MANY HORSES
                    He knows that you were always my 
                      favorite.  It feeds his fire.

      He turns back to Joseph, his eyes filled with sadness.  He 
      looks at his son sitting there looking so different, so 
        foreign to him.

                                    MANY HORSES (CONT'D)
                      The clothes, not so bad.  But you 
                      shouldn t have let them cut your 
                      hair.                                                                                       30.



      The freedmen continue digging out the cut.  They have made 
      good progress and are working well as a unit.  

        William is having a very hard time of it.  He falls to a 
      knee.  Exhausted.  Parched.

      Elam goes to the water barrel, brings him a drink in a ladle.

        Cullen roams the periphery of the cut, overseeing the 
        operation.

      He sees two men with wheelbarrows dumping their debris.  

                                    CULLEN
                      You men!

        Cullen heads towards them.  

                                    CULLEN (CONT D)
                      I thought I told you to dump that 
                      dirt over on the other side!

      Elam, giving William water, shoots a withering look at 
        Cullen.  

                                    ELAM
                      Hey!--

        William puts his hand on Elam s arm, cutting him off.

                                    WILLIAM
                      Keep your mouth shut.

                                    ELAM
                      I told  em to do it.

        Cullen turns to face Elam.  

                                    ELAM (CONT D)
                      We s fixin to fill in that dip 
                      over yonder next.  I figured we 
                      might as well have some fill dirt 
                      nearby.  

        Cullen looks over at the low area to which Elam is referring.

                                    CULLEN
                      You talk to me before any decisions 
                      are made.

                                    ELAM
                      Yassuh, massah.                                                                                        31.


      Elam looks at Cullen contemptuously.  Before Cullen can 
        respond...

                                    JOHNSON
                      What the hell is going on here? 

        Johnson rides up to them on his horse.  Sees Elam with the 
      water ladle. 

      He rides over to Elam, strikes him hard on the arm with his 
        riding crop.  Ladle, and water, go flying.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      You drink when I say you drink.

      Elam, pissed, grabs the horse s reins.  Horse spooks.  Rears 
      on hind legs.  Strikes William a violent blow in the head.

        William goes down.  Blood spurting from head laceration.

      Elam falls to his side.

                                    ELAM
                      Willie!

        William s eyes are wide, but unconscious.  

      Elam pulls off his shirt, tries desperately to stem the 
        bleeding.

                                    JOHNSON
                      This is what happens when you break 
                    my rules.

        Johnson rides away.  Elam glares hard up at Johnson.  Then 
        catches Cullen watching him.   


                                    END OF ACT THREE                                                                                      32.


                                        ACT FOUR


        Bustling with a booming trade.  Cullen makes his way through 
      the dirt main thoroughfare.  Something catches his eye.

        A long line of men leads from a small tent.  Above the tent a 
      sign: MCGINNES BROTHERS MAGIC LANTERN SHOW.  ADMISSION FIVE 
        CENTS. 

        Curious, Cullen goes to investigate.


      One surveyor awake.  He treads to the perimeter of the trees 
      to take a piss.  As he pees, he scans the tree line with 
      still sleepy eyes.

      He looks down as he buttons his pants. Suddenly...

      The TWANG of a bow string. An arrow rips into his stomach.  
        Passes right through him and sticks with a THWACK into a 
        buckboard.

      The surveyor looks down at the bloody stain blooming on his 
        shirt.  Then looks back toward the trees.  Now, we see what 
      he sees...

        Pawnee Killer and a group of Cheyenne braves materialize like 
        ghosts from the trees.  Pawnee Killer has the bow that shot 
      the surveyor.                                                                                      35.


        Awesome war bonnettatop Pawnee Killer s head.  Bristling 
      with hundreds of black magpie and raven feathers.  He wears 
      an ornamented dog rope over his shoulder and a bird bone 
        whistle hangs around his neck.

      His face painted red and black for war. 

      The surveyor goes to cry out, but Pawnee Killer fires another 
      arrow at him.  Striking him in the throat.  Surveyor s cry 
      cut off into a muffled gurgle.

      The braves move into the camp.  Utterly silent.  Which makes 
      the sight even more terrifying.

        OMIT4141


        Robert and Lily slip from the rear of the tent.  Robert has 
      the satchel.

                                    ROBERT
                      Run for the trees.  Don t look 
                      back.

        A brave looks up from scalping a surveyor just as Robert and 
      Lily disappear into the trees.  

      Lily and Robert make their way through the trees.

      The brave sees them.  Follows them into the tree line.

        Robert and Lily continue, running as fast as they can. Robert 
        starts gasping for breath.  Finally, he has to stop.  They 
      squat behind a clump of trees while Robert catches his 
        breath.

      Lily is trembling from head to foot.  Robert puts his arm 
        around her.  

      The brave continues stalking them.  He moves silently, a war 
      club in one hand, a bow in the other.

        Robert and Lily can hear the brave approaching.

      LILY AND ROBERT S P.O.V. -- The brave stops.  Listens.  A few 
      tense moments, then he starts to move on.

      Lily looks relieved.  They are about to move on, but Robert 
        suddenly starts to cough.  He tries to muffle it with his 
        handkerchief. 

      ON THE BRAVE -- He stops, tilts his head when he hears the 
        muffled coughing.  He grabs the handle of his war club.

      ON ROBERT AND LILY -- They start to move again, when...

        ...the brave is upon them, smashing Robert over the head with 
        a sickening crack, breaking the war club.  

      He turns on Lily.  She crawls backwards on her elbows.  The 
      brave drops the broken war club and pulls an arrow from his 
        quiver. He loads it into the bow.  

      Lily puts her hands up in front of her.  The brave lets the 
      arrow fly.  It rips through her palm and lodges in her 
        shoulder. It is all weirdly silent.  

      He loads another arrow and starts to shoot when...                                                                                      37.


        Robert, covered in blood, jumps him from behind, starts 
        choking him.  They fall to the ground. 

      Lily grabs the arrow in her shoulder.  Starts pulling it out.  
      It rips and tears at her flesh.  She grimaces in agony.

        Robert tries to hold onto the brave, but the brave pulls his 
        knife, thrusts it backwards into Robert s gut.  Robert falls 
      away from him. The brave gasps for breath.   

      Then, he stands and turns toward Lily.  But as he does...

        ...Lily attacks with the arrow she pulled from her shoulder.  
      She plunges it into the brave s neck. He tries to pull the 
      arrow out but Lily pushes it deeper.

      They do an awkward dance in the prairie grass, the brave s 
        carotid blood spraying Lily. Finally, he falls to the ground.

      Lily goes to Robert s side.  He is barely alive.  Both of 
      them are covered in blood.  

      Lily holds his face in her hands.  With his last ounce of 
        strength, he takes one of her hands and moves it to the 
        valise with the survey work in it.  

      Then, his eyes close.  She looks at him, heartbroken.  Not 
        wanting to leave him.  But then...

      Lily hears the Indians moving nearby.  She has no choice.  
      She slips off into the trees.

      They do not see her.


        Cullen comes out of the tent followed by Johnson, who keeps 
      his gun to the back of Cullen s head.

                                    JOHNSON
                      Out back.

        Cullen cuts between two tents.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      I know you killed two of the men in 
                      Maryland.  

      They reach the end of the tents.  

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      Out in that field.

        Cullen continues on.                                                                                        40.


                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      Then, I read in the newspaper about 
                      Prescott being killed in that 
                      church by a Griswoldand Gunnison  
                      six shooter.

      They make their way out into the field.  

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      I didn t think you d track me down 
                      out here, but I ll be damned if you 
                      didn t show up a few days later 
                      with that Griswoldplain as day on 
                      your hip.  Then you ask me about 
                      Meridian tonight and that cinched 
                      it.

      It s darker the farther into the field they go.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      I m not proud of what happened to 
                      your wife, Bohannon...

                                    CULLEN
                    It didn t  happen  to her.  You did 
                    it to her.

                                    JOHNSON
                      Yes.  We didit to her.  Idid it 
                    to her.  It d been a particularly 
                      bloody day.  Few of our boys had 
                      got ambushed and we were out for 
                      blood.  Then, the drinking 
                      started...
                            (pause)
                      Your wife was just in the wrong 
                      place at the wrong time.

        Johnson stops walking.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      Stop right here.

        Cullen stops.  Turns and faces Johnson.  

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      I just want you to know, it wasn t 
                    my idea to kill her.

                                    CULLEN
                            (confused)
                      She hung herself.                                                                                      41.


                                    JOHNSON
                      No.  The sergeant strangled her.  
                      Strung her up to make it look like 
                      a suicide.

                                    CULLEN
                      Sergeant?  What sergeant?

                                    JOHNSON
                      He s out here too.  Figured you 
                      were saving him for last.

        Smiles, seeing the desperation in Cullen s eyes.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      And you didn t even know about him.

                                    CULLEN
                      Who is he?

      He clicks back the hammer on his gun.

                                    JOHNSON
                      Hardly matters now. *

        Suddenly, Cullen s eyes go to something moving behind 
        Johnson.

                                    CULLEN
                      No!  

        Johnson frowns.  There is a sudden flash of silver at his 
        throat.  A long asthmatic wheeze escapes from Johnson s 
        throat, then a huge bloody knife wound becomes visible, 
        stretching from ear to ear.

      When Johnson falls to his knees, Elam is revealed standing 
        behind him, Bowie knife in hand.  Cullen looks at Elam.   

                                    ELAM
                      You welcome.

      Elam kicks Johnson face forward in the dirt. 

        Cullen kneels beside Johnson.  Turns him over, makes Johnson 
      look at him.

                                    CULLEN
                      Tell me his name.  

        Johnson manages an enigmatic smile.  Blood gurgles in the 
        terrible throat gash.   The name dies with him.

                                 END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                      42.


                                            TAG


      The horribly mutilated bodies of the surveyors lie sprawled 
        around the camp.  Scalps have been removed.  Noses cut off.  
        Bodies bristle with arrows.

                                    DURANT S VOICE
                    It is a thorny, brutal affair that 
                      rewards the lion for his ferocity.

        A black feather from Pawnee Killer s war bonnet is stuck to 
      the dried blood of one of the victim s scalps. 

        A HAND reaches down, picks it up.  REVEAL that the hand 
        belongs to...

        ...Joseph.  Joseph inspects the feather.  The concerned look 
      on his face tells you that he knows where it came from.  

                                    DURANT S VOICE (CONT'D)
                      And what of the poor zebra you ask?  
                      Well, the zebra is eaten as the 
                      zebra should be.  

      Now, we MOVE UP AND AWAY FROM THE SLAUGHTER, over a hill, 
      down to the adjacent valley...

      ...a SPECK moving on the horizon.  MOVE CLOSER, CLOSER, to 
      see that it is Lily.  Bloodied.  Limping along alone.                                                                                        43.


      Lost in the vast wilderness.  Still carrying the valise.  And 
        armed. A survivor.  

                                    DURANT S VOICE (CONT'D)
                      Make no mistake.  Blood will be 
                      spilt.  Lives will be lost. 
                      Fortunes will be made and men will 
                    be ruined.  


      The cut crew once again working.  At a NEW LOCATION. Cullen 
      now the leader.  He shouts a command.  The freedmen stop 
        working, go to get water.

      In the near distance, Hell On Wheels is being re-constructed 
      in the new location.

                                    DURANT S VOICE
                      There will be scandal and betrayal 
                      and perfidy of epic proportions but 
                      the lion shall prevail.

      Now, Cullen and Elam see TWO RIDERS galloping toward them.  
      They exchange a look. 

        Cullen s hand eases down and unfastens his holster strap.

        CAMERA MOVES AWAY FROM THEM... back down the tracks, in the 
        direction from which they came.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


      The area blighted.  Not a living tree to be seen.  Just 
        stumps.  Near the river bank.  Effluvium rising from a layer 
      of scum on the water.

      Flies rioting around unused buffalo carcasses which lie 
        rotting in the relentless sun.  

        Several crude graves, punctuated by rustic crosses, offer 
        testimony to the harshness of life in Hell on Wheels.    

      Wild dogs and coyotes sniff and pick through a smouldering 
      hill of garbage.  Follow the smoke up... 

        Vultures circle overhead in a black-smudged sky.

      But through it all, runs the railroad track.  Clean line.  
      Iron tracks gleaming in the sun.  Stretching straight and 
      true to the horizon.                                                                                      44.

                      You see, the secret I know is this:  
                      all of history is driven by the 
                      lion.  We drag the dumb zebras 
                      kicking and braying behind us, 
                      staining the earth with their cheap 
                      blood.


      The train hurtles through the night, passing through a vast 
        wasteland, then it is gone. The railroad tracks glow in the 
        moonlight. The image becomes...  

        A STYLIZED MAGIC LANTERN SLIDE OF THE SAME IMAGE.  A 
        MECHANICAL CLICK AND WHIR AS THE SLIDE IS REMOVED, LEAVING 
      ONLY A BLANK SCREEN.  

                                                                            FADE OUT:



                                    THE END
