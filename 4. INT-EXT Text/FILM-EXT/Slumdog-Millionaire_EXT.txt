Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present
Mumbai dust. A group of children are playing cricket on
a tarmac cricket ground. They are bare-foot, dressed in
little more than rags, wiry-skinny and fast on their
feet. Salim, a nine-year old, polishes the ball on his
almost non-existent shorts, comes in with surprising
speed and bowls. The batsman hooks it high in the air.
The bowler screams at a boy in the outfield.
SALIM
Jamal! Catch it! Catch it!
The seven-year old Jamal stares up at the ball, jinks
around trying to get into position.

He pays no heed to the rest of the children who are
scattering fast to the edges of the tarmac. The ball
seems suspended in the blue sky. Shouts from the other
children seem very far away. He doesn't notice that
they are screaming for him to get out of the way. Jamal
adjusts his feet for the perfect catch. Then out of
nowhere, a light aircraft almost takes his head off as
it comes in to land on the tarmac runway. Jamal is
knocked to his feet by the down-draft of the plane. The
ball bounces away. Also flattened, Salim gets to his
feet.
SALIM (CONT'D)
How could you drop that? It was
a sitter.
Then Salim's face turns to one of alarm.
12
12
At the back of a pack of children, carrying a piece of
wood crudely fashioned into a sword, Jamal is running
for his life, pursued by an ancient but surprisingly
nimble Security Guard from the airport who is screaming
abuse and wielding a long stick. The kids dash across a
rubbish dump and disappear down dozens of tiny lanes
that run in between the shacks of the slum.
SECURITY GUARD
Private-ka land! Private-ka
land! The planes won't kill you,
mader chod, I will!
Jamal and Salim- also with a wooden sword- break off,
head down a separate lane. The Guard pursues them.

Salim is sitting on a chair at the end of a rickety
wooden pier, though it is not water, but a sea of
rubbish and sewage that lies below them. There are
dozens of these piers protruding from the slum onto
airport land, each with a toilet shack perched right at
the end. Another man hurries up the pier and hands
Salim a coin.
SALIM
Immediately, sir.
Turns to the toilet door.
SALIM (CONT'D)
Bhai, get out of there. Prakash
wants a shit.
JAMAL O.S.
Not finished.
PRAKASH
Stop your time-pass. This is
urgent.

JAMAL O.S.
It's a shy one. Since when was

SALIM
Since there was a customer
waiting, that's when.
He flashes another placatory smile at Prakash.
JAMAL O.S.
(singing/ grunting)
Come on out, you beauty, unveil
yourself, my darling-warling....
PRAKASH
Look, kid, I got a bad stomach.
It's borderline....
A disturbing combination of heaving and snake-charmer
noises come from the toilet shack. Finally Prakash can
stand it no longer.
PRAKASH (CONT'D)
I'm off to Devi's bog. Give me
that.
He snatches the coin back from Salim and hurries off.
Salim bangs on the toilet door.
SALIM
You just lost me good money, you
stupid idiot-
Salim stops. In the distance, there is the faint sound
of shouting, a crowd coming closer. Then the crowd
bursts through the outer shacks of the slum, pour onto
the rubbish dump and make for the airfield.
MAN
It's Amitabh! That's his
helicopter!
JAMAL O.S.
Amitabh? Amitabh Bacchan?
21
21
Jamal peers through one of the many cracks in the
shack. He sees crowds surging around the pier, charging
towards a landing helicopter. Salim shoves the chair
under the door handle- effectively locking it- and runs
down the pier to join the chase. Jamal pulls up his
shorts.
JAMAL
No! Wait! Salim, sala! Salim!

Rattles the locked door. Pulls a torn flyer from his
pocket advertising an Amitabh movie.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
Wait! Amitabh....
He looks down the toilet hole at the sewage beneath
him, the landing helicopter, the disappearing crowd. A
final rattle of the door. There is only one way out. He
jumps down the hole, sprawling headlong into a year's
worth of human waste, managing to keep the flyer out
the mire. He runs for the helicopter.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
Amitabh-ji! Amitabh-ji!
Salim is at the back of the crowd, trying to force a
way through, but the adults shove him back. Not so for
Jamal. The down-draft from the helicopter flicks bits
of sewage from his clothes. Disgusted fans curse him
and get out of his way. Suddenly, the red sea parts and
there is nobody between Jamal and Amitabh Bacchan
getting out of the helicopter.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
Please. Amitabh-ji.
Jamal holds out his flyer. Used to signing autographs,
the movie star barely looks at Jamal. He takes the
flyer and scribbles his autograph on it.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
A thousand thanks, Amitabh-ji.
He hands the flyer back to Jamal as his bodyguards
surround him and hustle him into a car. Jamal chases
the flyer across the tarmac, grabs it. Kisses it.
22
22
From high up, the rickety tin roof-tops of the slum
seem to stretch to the horizon. There is a distant
shout, a figure waving an arm.
MAN
It's coming!
Then another shout and another, a chain of voices
coming closer. People come out of their doorways with
pails and buckets. The shouts come closer until we see
a naked figure entirely encased in bubbles dancing and
singing in the lane. Jamal is the happiest boy in the
slum.
JAMAL

Amitabh, Amitabh, oh Amitabh!

Water comes bubbling through a hose and Jamal's mother
hoses down her ecstatic son.
23
23
Not far away, Salim wanders to Mister Chi's stall. He
glances around to make sure everybody is glued to the
hindi film on Mister Chi's tv and surreptitiously slips
Mister Chi the signed flyer. Mister Chi takes a look
and gives Salim a small wad of rupees. He sticks the
money in his pocket, slinks away.
24
24
A tear-stained Jamal is furiously trying to batter
Salim, but Salim's extra strength and height means that
he can keep Jamal at bay with one hand, Jamal's
flailing fists punching thin air.
JAMAL
Sala! Sala!
Salim's laughter only makes Jamal cry harder.
25
31
Right next to the railway lines is a pond of dirty
water surrounded by shacks in which dozens of women are
washing clothes. Trains flash past only feet away from
them. Down the other end of the pond, nine-year old
Jamal and Salim are splashing noisily with some other
children. Jamal's mother pauses in her scrubbing, wipes
sweat from her forehead and gazes up at the leaden sky.
JAMAL AND SALIM'S MOTHER
It's going to come. Today. I can
feel it.
The woman next to her nods.
WOMAN
Hope so. My head is exploding.

MOTHER
Yes. We need rain.
Jamal is trying to intercept the ball that Salim and
Krishna are throwing to each other. He's not having
much success. The ball flies overhead again from Salim
to Krishna. Jamal dives for it, misses and goes
underwater. When he comes up for air, he shakes his
head, clearing his ears of water. Then he stops,
listens. Shakes his head again. Definitely something
strange. Thunder? Salim and Krishna are trading
catches, unaware that anything has changed. But Jamal's
mother has heard it too. The faintest sound of
shouting, roaring. The wave of noise is still faint but
getting louder. A frozen moment broken by:
MOTHER (CONT'D)
Run! Jamal, Salim, run!
Everybody stares at her. A train speeds through as she
continues to shout, her words lost beneath the
thundering train.
MOTHER (CONT'D)
Go! Run!
The train goes through, the last carriage flying past
suddenly opening up the sight of a wall of rioting men
wielding clubs, scythes, metal bars. They come
screaming across the railway tracks.
SALIM
Krishna, quick!
Salim holds out his hand to Krishna who is wading with
difficulty through the water.
KRISHNA
No way! You're a bloody Muslim.
Get away from me!
The rioters leap the tracks and are upon them.
KRISHNA (CONT'D)
They're Muslims! Him and him!
MOTHER
Go!
Salim and Jamal scramble out and retreat into the
lanes. Salim turns to see his Mother felled by a
rioter. She is surrounded by screaming, chanting men
who rain blows down on her. Jamal runs back and drags
Salim down an alley. As they head down the alley, they
get glimpses of burning houses, fleeing women, a three-
year old boy in a doorway, painted entirely in garish
blue. He stares at them. In his hand, he is carrying a
bow and arrow. An eleven-year old girl dressed only in
a pair of pants runs after them.

She has two bleeding red gashes on her back. They turn
a corner and head towards some vans full of police.
Jamal sees Mister Nandha, the school teacher, stops.
JAMAL
Salim!
Then Mister Nandha starts walking towards him. An oasis
of calm in the chaos. Jamal looks at him with relief.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
Mister Nandha.
Mister Nandha smiles, walks towards them.
MISTER NANDHA
Ram nam satya hai, Babri Masjid
dhvasth hai.
JAMAL
Mister Nandha?
MISTER NANDHA
We have destroyed your mosque.
Now, the followers of Ram will
drive you dogs out of our city.
From behind his back he produces a knife and runs
towards Jamal, screaming.
MISTER NANDHA (CONT'D)
Ram has returned to his temple!
Ram has returned!
They flee, but Jamal turns, sees the girl, frozen. He
chases back a few steps, hauls her arm. The spell
broken, and they are off.
32
33
Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.
Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly
the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.
JAMAL
We should go back.
Silence.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
See if Ama-
Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a
moment. But only a moment.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
What about Jeevan Chacha?
Salim shakes his head.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
Maybe he-
Salim shakes his head again.
SALIM
- I saw him. He was with them.
JAMAL
But he wouldn't hurt-
SALIM
- he was with them!
JAMAL
But-
SALIM
- shut up, Jamal, can't you?
Just shut up!
Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and
hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps
back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds
another rock and hurls this in her direction too.
SALIM (CONT'D)
Ja!
Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across
the city. Rain begins to come down.
JAMAL
What shall we do?

No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

A flash of Jamal's mother being clubbed to the ground.
Her scream.
36
49
Jamal is studying a piece of paper and reading out
numbers from it. There is something not quite right
about Jamal- perhaps the fact that there are two feet
by his ears. Salim is standing on his shoulders and
spraying the numbers on a wall with an aerosol and a
certain lack of confidence.

Four, nine, zero, nine- the one
with the stick going down, Salim-
six- stick going up-
Latika's head appears from around the corner.
LATIKA
(whispered)
Oi!
But they don't hear. Then she is running for her life
past the pair of them.
JAMAL
Six, one, shit, let's go-
Salim collapses off Jamal's shoulders and all three run
off down an alley past a dozen of the gang's sprayed-on
adverts all reading: "Beanbags- 989 4909661". A fat
Security Guard with a long stick huffs round the
corner. Chases them up an alley. Nowhere to go except
through an imposing gate that clearly leads to a
private house.
SECURITY GUARD
Got you now, little shits.
50
50
They charge across the lawn, down one side of the house
where all the washing is hanging. The Guard gets caught
up in drying sheets, towels. He fights his way through
to see Salim, Latika and Jamal leaping over the wall to
safety. But Jamal turns, jumps back and grabs a girl's
dress from the line.
SECURITY GUARD
Aha! Little thief!
The Security Guard lands a couple of blows on Jamal's
back as he dodges around him and back across the lawn,
dress in hand. The Security Guard gives up.
SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
Pervert!
51
52
Blazing sun. Diggers and trucks are shifting mounds of
rubble on a rubbish dump that seems to stretch for
ever. Oblivious to the dust kicked up by the trucks,
Latika is picking up old plastic bags, examining each
one and putting the less worn in a big sack. The dress
is recognisable but dusty and torn. She stoops to dig
another bag out of the dirt, but stops and stares.
Shimmering in the heat, a rickety pick-up truck comes
through the rubbish dump gates. Toots at the Guard who
waves, pulls up in the dump. "Hope Orphanage is written
on the side of the van. A man gets out. Looks around.
53
54
The hills on the edge of Bombay. Greenery and space,
for the first time in the film. The pick-up truck pulls
up outside a building with Jamal, Salim and Latika
sitting on a bench in the back. Maman gets out. Drops
the gate on the back of the pick-up.
MAMAN
Anyone hungry? Come on in.
35.
55
57
A group of children are sitting in the jumble of
concrete under a motorway flyover. Cars surround them,
bumper to bumper. Latika and Jamal are playing an
improvised hopscotch on concrete slabs. They are
giggling, bumping into each other, tickling, laughing.
Salim and Punnoose are sitting together, smoking. Salim
is staring hard at Jamal and Latika until Punnoose
grunts, a sign for Salim to clap his hands.
SALIM
Okay, let's go, let's go! It's
not a bloody holiday!
The children get to their feet. Latika sighs, puts a
patch over her eye and grabs a pair of crutches.
Suddenly, the lame beggar. Salim goes over to one of
the girls, who is carrying a sleeping baby. Puts out
his hand.
SALIM (CONT'D)
Give me that.
The girl shakes her head. Salim grabs her by the hair
in one hand and takes the baby with the other. He
shoves her to the ground. The other children stare.
JAMAL
Hey, Salim!
He challenges Jamal.
SALIM
What, chot bhai? You got a
problem?

He laughs and walks over to Latika.
SALIM (CONT'D)

LATIKA
I don't want it.
SALIM
You'll earn double. I'm doing
you a favour, Latika.
JAMAL
She doesn't want it.
SALIM
Chup, Jamal.
Latika turns away and begins to walk towards the cars.
SALIM (CONT'D)
I'll drop it.
He holds the baby up. Latika grabs the baby with a cry
just as Salim releases it from his hands. Salim pinches
the baby.
SALIM (CONT'D)
Triple if it's crying.
Latika snatches it away. Salim laughs, goes back to
sitting with Punnoose. The children scatter to the cars
trapped at the lights, tapping plaintively on the
windows and making the universal begging gesture.
58
63
Salim and Jamal walk along the path, Jamal humming
happily. Salim checks behind him, sees Punnoose
following.
JAMAL
So, this is it, hey, bhai? The
good life, here we come....

Athos.
Jamal is suddenly alert. Slows

the wall.

They charge past the prone Arvind- a flash of bloodied
bandages covering his eyes.
67
67
Heavy, desperate breathing. Feet stumble on roots. Fall
into holes. The three children are running. Branches
smack into their faces. But they are so scared, nothing
will stop them. Behind them, torches scour the
undergrowth. Men shouting. They break out of the woods
and are confronted with a train goods yard.
68
68
They run over the tracks, between the trains, but the
shouts are getting louder, the torches closer. A diesel
engine is moving out of the station. Jamal, Latika and
Salim sprint for the Guard's Van at the very back of
the moving train. Punnoose is closest to them. Salim is
fastest and first to jump the train. He holds out his
hand. Jamal grabs it and is hauled in. Jamal holds his
hand out to Latika.
JAMAL
Come on! Faster!
She reaches out to him. Their hands almost touch.

JAMAL (CONT'D)
Take it! Take it! I can't

Salim barges Jamal out of the way. Jamal
stumbles back
as Salim reaches his hand out to Latika,
so he doesn't
see Latika's hand grasp Salim's, nor see
their eyes
lock onto each other, nor see Salim very
deliberately
let go of her hand. Latika stumbles.
LATIKA
Jamal!
Jamal scrambles to the rail. The train gains more
speed. Jamal climbs on to the top rung, makes to jump,
but Salim flings him backward. Jamal tries to scramble
to his feet again, but Salim restrains him.
JAMAL
Got to go back. We've got to go
back.
SALIM
He'll kill us if we go back.
Jamal! He was going to take your
eyes out- with a bloody spoon!
The train is speeding along. Jamal breaks free and
stares back at Latika.
SALIM (CONT'D)
She'll be alright. She always
is.
Latika stumbles again and stops running. They watch as
Punnoose catches up with her and stops running. He
smashes Latika to the ground.
69
71
Salim and Jamal are sitting on top of the train. Jamal
is staring blankly down the track.
SALIM
Ar, Jamal...
Salim puts an arm around Jamal's shoulder. Jamal wipes
the tears from his eyes, shakes his head furiously.
Salim gets up. Holds out his hand.
SALIM (CONT'D)
Come.
JAMAL
Where you going?
SALIM
First class, bhai. Where else?
45.
72
72
The ancient train is huffing slowly up an incline. A
middle class Indian couple with their three children
are sitting at a table, their breakfast spread before
them. Into this domestic scene, unseen by them comes
Jamal. Upside down and still outside the train, he is
clearly being dangled by his ankles from the train
roof. He gives a few, silent directional signs to Salim
who manoeuvres him across, dips his hand into the open
window, snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be
hoisted up. The family continue to eat, unperturbed.
Then Jamal appears again. This time one of the children
spots him. Despite Jamal giving her a friendly wave,
she yelps. The father of the group grabs Jamal's hand
which has just snatched a samosa. There is a tussle,
Salim holding onto Jamal's legs, the father holding
onto Jamal's arms and Jamal in the middle, shouting.
Salim is losing the battle and his footing. He stumbles
and the pair of them fall from the train, rolling and
tumbling down an embankment in slow-motion.
Interspersed with the seemingly endless tumble are
images of Jamal and Salim on top of different trains-
- huddled together against the freezing rain...
- surfing the wind at the front of the train...
- admiring the distant Himalaya....
JAMAL V/O
We criss-crossed the country
from Rajasthan to Calcutta.
Every time we were thrown off we
got back on again. This was our
home for years. A home with
wheels and a whistle.
The final tumble as they crash onto flat ground.
73
73
Groggily, Jamal sits up and groans. Somehow in the
tumble, he has been transformed into a twelve year-old.
And Salim a strong fourteen year-old. Through the haze
of pain and dust, Jamal sees something glinting in the
distance- something impossibly beautiful.
JAMAL
Salim? Is this heaven?
SALIM
You're not dead, Jamal.
Jamal clears his head. Sees Salim picking himself up
from the ground. But the apparition is still there.
(CONTINUED)

JAMAL
So what's that?
SALIM
Wow.
They stare at the apparition. The unmistakable outline
of the Taj Mahal rises from the horizon, pink in the
morning sun. Nothing could be more beautiful.
JAMAL
Some hotel, huh?
74
74
Jamal and Salim wander under the great dome of the Taj
Mahal. Two tiny slum kids dwarfed by this massive
monument to love. It is a moment of genuine wonderment
for them. Then a tour guide bustles nearby, tourists
flowing behind him.
GUIDE
...there are five main elements
to the Taj. The Darwaza, the
main gateway, the Bageecha or
garden, the Masjid or mosque,
the Naqqar Khana, the rest house
and the Rauza or mausoleum. If
you would like to follow me, I
will show you the ninety-nine
names of Allah on Mumtaz's tomb.
As before, please remove your
shoes.
Jamal follows the Guide and his entourage into the
mausoleum. Salim meanwhile is studying the line of
shoes. Tries a smart pair of women's court shoes,
before slipping a foot into a nice, white sneaker. A
smile crosses his face. His other foot quickly follows
and he saunters away, all mock-innocence.
75
75
Jamal comes out of the mausoleum into the bright
sunlight and looks around for Salim. No sign of him.
Suddenly, a German couple approach.
ADA
Please, what time is the next
tour?
JAMAL

JAMAL

schedule, you see, young man.
Have to see the Red Fort this
afternoon. Would it be possible
to show us around now? Obviously
we understand it would cost more
for just the two of us...
Peter waves a couple of thousand rupee notes at Jamal.
His eyes widen.
JAMAL
But of course, Madam. Please
follow me.
Jamal stalks off. The Germans follow. Jamal stops
before the monument. Points a confident arm at it.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
This is....the Taj Mahal.
A terrible pause as Peter and Ada stare at him. Clearly
more is expected. He moves off at a pace.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
The Taj Mahal was built by the
Emperor Khurram for his wife
Mumtaz who was maximum beautiful
woman in the whole world. When
she died, the Emperor decided to
build this five star hotel for
everyone who wanted to visit her
tomb...but he died in- in
fifteen eighty-seven, before any
of the rooms were built. Or the
lifts. The swimming pool,
however, as you can see was
completed on schedule in top
class fashion.
He waves confidently in the direction of the fountains.
ADA
It says nothing of this in the
guide book.
JAMAL
With respect, Madam, the guide
book is written by a bunch of
lazy, good-for-nothing, Indian
beggars.

Jamal shows the tourist a battered postcard of Princess
Diana, staring doe-eyed into the distance with the Taj
behind. The tourist sits. Jamal adjusts her legs so
that they match the postcard. Takes the photo....

Jamal stands a Tourist on a wall and positions his
hands to create the optical illusion that he is
dangling the Taj from his fingers. Takes a photo for
the Tourist. Behind the Tourist, Salim and a boy called
Shankar pick up the Tourist's shoes and saunter
casually across the grass.
CUT TO:

By the side of a busy market street Salim stands next
to a row of stolen shoes. Sneakers, court shoes,
sandals, high heels...he is busy bartering with a man
over a pair whilst Jamal tries to shout up business.
JAMAL
Top-class fashion, bottom-class
prices! Shoes for all! Shoes for
all!
79

Hectares of drying clothes by the side of the river.
Spectacular squares of red, saffron, white. Not far
away from the dhobi ghat, there is a makeshift slum-
camp where Salim and a gang of children are sitting,
smoking. Jamal joins them, hands over a wad of rupees
to Salim. Salim counts the cash, hands half to Shankar
and slaps Jamal so hard on the back that he nearly
falls over.
JAMAL V/O
And life was good.

Jamal gets out of a new Mercedes driven by an Indian
Man. A middle-aged American couple also get out. Jamal
points them down a lane which opens out on India's
largest dhobi where hundreds of women are beating
clothes on stone slabs.

He gets out his video camera and wanders towards the
dhobi ghat. Behind them a motor rickshaw pulls up.
Salim, Shankar and a couple of the street kids from the
Taj leap out. Within seconds, the Mercedes is up on
bricks and the wheels are being removed. Salim takes a
hacksaw to the Mercedes badge on the bonnet, whilst
urging the others on.

A shout from the top of the lane and the boys scatter,
bouncing the four wheels at speed down the lane. Jamal,
the Indian driver and the two Americans return. They
stop in front of the denuded car.
CLARK
Woah. What happened here?
Suddenly the Indian driver is slapping Jamal
ferociously around the head with one of his shoes.
DRIVER
I give you two tight slaps,
mader chod!
JAMAL
I don't know! I didn't do it,

But the beating continues, the driver kicking Jamal
down onto the floor. The two Americans stare, uncertain
what to do.

CLARK (CONT'D)
You okay?
JAMAL
You wanted to see the `real
India', Mister David. Here it
is.
ADELE
Well, here's a bit of the real
America, too, son.
Adele pulls out his wallet and rummages for dollars.

A battered Jamal limps along the river bank towards the
Taj. He stops, bathes his swollen face in the river.
Then looks up. Strange lights appear to emanate from
the base of the monument. And then strange sounds.
82
82
Jamal climbs
a crumbling
wall and is confronted with an
opera taking
place right
under the dome. Gluck's Orfeo
ed Euridice.
Hundreds of
India's smartest professionals
are watching
from banked
seating on a scaffolding
frame.
83
83
Jamal and a couple of street kids slip under the
scaffolding supporting the banked seats. The street
kids are trying to reach the hand-bags of the women
above them.
BOY
(hissing)
Oi, Jamal! There's a woman with
no panties on over here.
Jamal reaches up and easily lifts a wallet from a man's
trouser pocket. On stage, the actors start singing.
Jamal seems to have forgotten the wallet and stares,
mesmerised, at the stage.
WOMAN
Why don't you put it back and
listen to the music?
(CONTINUED)

Jamal starts, makes to run, but the woman who spoke
holds out a cigarette. A Canadian back-packer is
sitting, staring at the singers.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
It's called Orfeo. Orpheus and
Eurydice. Orpheus- that one
there- is looking for his lover,
Eurydice. She died, but he can't
live without her.
She hands him a cigarette. He puts the wallet back. She
smiles at him and they both turn to the stage.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
The pain is so bad that he goes
to the underworld- the place we
go when we die- to try to get
her back.
JAMAL
You can't do that. Can you?
WOMAN
(shrugging)
You can in opera.
JAMAL
Does he find her?
WOMAN
Watch and see.
Jamal watches as Orpheus sings one of the most
beautiful pieces of music a human is likely to hear.
Tears are running down Jamal's cheeks.

Salim, Shankar, Jamal and the Taj Gang are gathered
around a campfire. All of them wear extraordinary foot-
wear of one form or another, from elaborate high heels
to walking boots five sizes too large. A home-made
hooka pipe is being passed around the fire. The eyes of
the children have long since stopped focussing. Salim
is sporting a Mercedes Benz badge on a chain around his
neck. Behind him, Jamal appears, his face swollen. He
takes off his fake Guide's Badge and throws it in the
fire.
SALIM
Woah! What are you- Jamal?
JAMAL
We have to go, Salim.
SALIM
Go? Go where?
(CONTINUED)

JAMAL
Bombay.
SALIM
Don't be stupid. We're making
good money here.
JAMAL
We should have gone a long time
ago.
Salim turns to Shankar with sudden understanding.
SALIM
Oh, God. Baby brother's in love.
With a flat-chested hijra.
JAMAL
Latika was one of us. A
musketeer.
SALIM
A musketeer...Grow up, Jamal.
Look, how was I to know they'd
beat you up. Here, you can have
some of the cash. Come on...
JAMAL
I've got cash.
He rips out a wad of dollar bills from his pocket.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
Dollars.
SALIM
How much?
JAMAL
Enough. I'm getting my stuff.
He walks off.
SALIM
Wait! Jamal! Ah, shit!
He gets up, kicks the fire in rage and stomps after
Jamal.
85
89
From a thousand feet in the sky, looking down on the
limitless megatropolis of Mumbai. Half-built sky-
scrapers, slums, factories, roads, trains.
JAMAL V/O
Bombay had turned into Mumbai.
We descend, down until the lines of ants become people.
JAMAL V/O (CONT'D)
The orphanage had gone, the slum
had gone, the people.... all
gone. And everywhere was
building, building, building.
Descending even further, we pick out a construction
site and then Jamal....
90
90
..who is staring through a wire fence at the
construction site.
JAMAL V/O
But I knew she was here.
Somewhere she was here.
He turns away, then something catches his eye.
Underneath all the scraps of flyers and posters on a
broken wall is a corner of something that Jamal
recognises. He tears back a poster. Underneath, faded
but recognisable is one of their beanbag graffiti
advertisements.
91
91
Jamal asks a group of stall-holders on the slum main
street. They shrug, aren't interested. The camera pulls
up and up until Jamal is nothing but a dot wandering
the maze of lanes, railways and highways, one among
endless millions of people.
JAMAL V/O
Evenings, I searched. Days, I
worked.

92

Jamal wanders up to the rickshaw drivers parked outside
the hotel. He stops and asks a question. The drivers
shake their heads. Jamal continues up the steps towards
a door, exhausted face and grubby clothes walking
straight towards camera. He goes through the door and
immediately....
93
96
Jamal is dodging the traffic at a busy junction. He
moves around the beggars who are working the cars. Then
he hears singing. He looks around, suddenly panicked.
It is a siren song drawing him across the road, not
even noticing that he is narrowly run down by a couple
of cars, to a traffic island underneath a flyover. He
turns a corner and there is the singer, leaning up
against one of the struts of the flyover. Arvind. Older
now, just like Jamal, a fourteen year-old boy. But eye-
less. Jamal freezes. He approaches Arvind and waits
until he has finished singing. Despite his eyeless
sockets, Arvind appears to know somebody is there. He
turns and bows low, putting his hands together.
ARVIND
Namaste, Sahib. Any kindness you
give will be repaid in heaven
many times.
(CONTINUED)

Jamal gets a couple of notes out of his pocket and puts
them into Arvind's outstretched hand. He feels the
notes with his fingers.
ARVIND (CONT'D)
A fifty. And a hundred!
Blessings upon you, Sahib.
JAMAL
How do you know?
ARVIND
There are many ways of seeing.
Arvind puts his hands together and bows deep again.
Then, Jamal takes his shoe off and gets out a hundred
dollar bill.
JAMAL
Here.
Jamal crouches down and puts the bill into Arvind's
hand. His fingers feel it. He sniffs it.
ARVIND
Dollars. But how many?
JAMAL
One hundred.
ARVIND
Now you are playing with me,
Sahib.
JAMAL
No. I swear.
ARVIND
What is on it? The pictures.
Tell me.
JAMAL
A building. With a clock on it.
Trees behind it.
ARVIND
The other side. Turn it over.
JAMAL
A man- it doesn't say his name.
He is sort of bald, but has long
hair on the sides.
ARVIND
(smiling)
Benjamin Franklin. My God, my
God. Thank you, Sahib. You were
generous the first time. But
this...
(CONTINUED)
61.
96
CONTINUED: (2)
96
He stops. Suspects.
ARVIND (CONT'D)
And without even a song?
A long pause. Arvind keeps hold of Jamal's arm.
ARVIND (CONT'D)
So you are rich, now, are you,
Jamal? I am happy for you.
JAMAL
I am so sorry, Arvind.
ARVIND
You got away. I didn't. That is
all. No, no tears. Tears mock me
all the more.
JAMAL
Arvind, I am looking for-
ARVIND
- how's your voice, Jamal?
JAMAL
I don't know. I haven't sung
since- since then. Arvind, I-
ARVIND
- and your eyes?
JAMAL
(surprised)
My eyes? My eyes are fine.
ARVIND
Then stay away, chutiy, and
count your blessings every
morning you open them and see
the sun rising. You owe Maman.
He doesn't forget.
JAMAL
I owe Latika.
Arvind shakes his head angrily.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
Please. Is she alive? Arvind, is
she alive?
ARVIND
Alive? Oh, she's alive alright.
It's your life, Jamal. Pila
Street. They call her Cherry,
now.
(CONTINUED)

JAMAL
Thank you.
Jamal heads off through the traffic. Arvind shouts
after him.
ARVIND
I will sing at your funeral,
yaar.

Dark, crowded streets. Gangs of women stand outside the
doorways or lean out of upstairs windows. They are
garishly-dressed prostitutes varying in age from 13 to
60. Men wander past, eying the possibilities,
exchanging lewd comments with them. Among the hordes on
the pavement are Jamal and Salim. They pass doorway
after doorway of narrow rooms where prostitutes wait
for customers. Jamal and Salim stop at each group of
women, Salim taking the lead, clearly asking them
something, as the women either shrug or offer them
something lewd- judging by the laughter that follows.
But one woman in a narrow doorway points down the
street. Jamal has to drag a reluctant Salim away from
the group.
98
101
Children are splashing in the sea, flying kites,
digging sand, laughing. Salim, Latika and Jamal are
crouched on the shore watching the sun sink into the
sea. Latika is going through Maman's wallet, Salim is
fingering the pistol, admiringly. Jamal is staring out
to sea. Each in their own world, yet sharing swigs from
a bottle of Johnny Walker.
LATIKA
Shit, there's thousands here.
SALIM
We should be celebrating.
JAMAL
You just killed somebody.
SALIM
He was going to kill us.
JAMAL
Where did you get the gun?
SALIM
Bought it. Now, I'm going to
have to throw this beauty in the
sea.
LATIKA
You didn't need to kill him.
SALIM
What? Typical. I save your life
and you're on at me. All you
ever do is mess us up. Whenever
you're around-
JAMAL
- shut up, can't you? Just shut
up.
Silence.
SALIM
Why can't you just be happy,
huh?
(CONTINUED)
67.
101
CONTINUED:
101
JAMAL
Happy?
SALIM
You got what you wanted, didn't
you? So, let's celebrate.
LATIKA
Yeah. Let's celebrate.
She takes a long swig from the bottle.
LATIKA (CONT'D)
While we can.
She nudges Jamal and holds the bottle out to him.
Smiles at him. He smiles back, shakes the black dog
from his head and takes a long, long drink. Latika and
Salim cheer.
101A
101A
Latika, Salim and Jamal bend back a bit of the wire
mesh fence that protects the deserted hotel. Crawl in.
102
105
Salim wanders the crowded streets of a slum. He stops
uncertainly at a doorway where a group of men are
lolling, smoking. Plucks up his courage.
SALIM
I'm looking for Javed-bhai.
MAN
Ja, mada chod. He's not looking
for you. Ja!
SALIM
I need to see him.
The group of men stir, irritated now. Salim begins to
back away, then stops. Pulls the gun from behind his
back.
SALIM (CONT'D)
I killed Maman. I'll kill you
too. Easy.
The group are frozen.
JAVED
You killed him?
Javed is standing in the doorway.
JAVED (CONT'D)
My enemy's enemy is my friend,
no? So, come in, friend.
106
110
At the gate, a Security Guard is sitting in his chair.
JAMAL
Where are they?
The Guard grunts.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
Where did they go?
A more impatient grunt from the Guard. He stands up,
walks towards Jamal.
JAMAL (CONT'D)
Please, Sir. Which way?
SECURITY GUARD
I don't know and I don't care.
The Guard raises his stick and gives him a roar. Jamal
backs away onto the street. The Guard slams the gate
shut. Jamal looks despairingly up and down the street
at the teeming traffic, the crowds.
PREM V/O
Ready for another question.
JAMAL V/O
Yes. I'm ready.

Leaden skies. Torrential rain is hammering on the tin
roofs of the slum.
114
116
Jamal nods hello to a number of neighbours, also bare-
legged, also with their shoes in hand. Together, they
wade to higher ground, put on their trousers and shoes
and trudge up to the main road.

An Indian batsman hits a nicely-timed stroke, heads
down the wicket for a single. Turns. The other batsman
is taking a second run.

The Indian tries to halt the other batsman with a
shout, then succumbs to the inevitable and charges down
the wicket. A fielder hurls the ball at the stumps. The
bails fly off.
130
131
Jamal is riding the construction lift to the top of a
high building, still just a shell but buzzing with
carpenters, bricklayers, cable-layers. The lift stops
at the top. Jamal gets out. Looks around. He is miles
up. Alone.
SALIM
Jamal!
Jamal looks around. There is Salim standing on the edge
of the building. He saunters over to Jamal, his arms
outstretched in theatrical greeting. He is groomed,
expensively dressed with the best mobile money can buy
dangling from a gold chain around his neck.
SALIM (CONT'D)
God is good, bhai. God is good.
He tries to embrace Jamal. With as much force as he can
muster, Jamal punches him in the face. Salim takes it.
Stands there. Wipes blood from his lip. Gets another
punch. Then another and another, not even defending
himself, until he is being beaten back by a raging
Jamal towards the edge of the building. Finally, he
tries to reason with Jamal
SALIM (CONT'D)
Maman's boys were after us. Had
to skip.
Jamal keeps on beating him back.
JAMAL
Liar.

SALIM
Left a message at reception.
Waited weeks for you in Nagpur.
JAMAL
There was no message at
reception.
SALIM
Bhai, I left a message.
Salim opens his arms, defenceless. It would take one,
small push to send him over the edge. There is a
moment, when Jamal might. He even has his hands on his
chest.
JAMAL
I will never forgive you.
SALIM
I know.
The fury in Jamal subsides minutely. Finally, he turns
away with a roar of frustration. Salim hangs his head.
131A
131A
Jamal and Salim are sitting on the very edge of the
building. They can see for miles across the city. Salim
has rediscovered his attitude.
SALIM
Can you believe it? This was our
slum. We lived just there, huh?
Now it is business, apartments,
call centres...Fuck USA, fuck
China. India is at the centre of
the world, now, bhai. And I am
at the centre of the centre,
Jamal. This is all Javed-bhai's.
JAMAL
Javed Mehta? The Gangster from
our slum? You work for him?
SALIM
Who else would protect us from
Maman's gang, huh?
JAMAL
What do you do for him?
SALIM
Anything he asks.
Salim's mobile rings. Salim is immediately subservient
on the phone. Rings off.

SALIM (CONT'D)
He is coming. You must go. My

He hands Jamal a card.
JAMAL
What for?
SALIM
You think I am going to let you
out of my sight again, little
brother? You stay with me now.
Ab phut!
JAMAL
Salim, where's Latika?
SALIM
Still? She's gone, Jamal. Long
gone. Now go. Quick.
Jamal gets up, hurries away, hidden behind piles of
building materials just as Javed appears in his flash
suit and jewelry. Three of his young henchmen walk
alongside.
132
135
Salim comes out of his apartment block. Gets into his
jeep. Drives off. Doesn't notice Jamal in the motor
rickshaw that pulls out and follows him.
136
136
Salim approaches a gate-house to a large bungalow. The
Door-Keeper nods to him, rings a bell. From the
rickshaw, Jamal watches a woman come to the door.
Latika. Eighteen, completely beautiful and rich. She
hands Salim a package and goes back inside. Salim gets
in his jeep and drives away.
137
137
Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.
JAMAL
Baba, I am the new cook from the
agency. A thousand apologies, I
am late for the Memsaab.
The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief
pause, he returns.
DOOR-KEEPER
She doesn't know anything about
any cook. There's supposed to be
a dishwasher being delivered.
Know anything about that?
(CONTINUED)

JAMAL
Baba, I am your dishwasher!
The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.
Latika appears at the gate.
LATIKA
Haven't I told you, don't
interrupt when I'm watching-
She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.
LATIKA (CONT'D)
- come inside. I'll show you the
kitchen.
138
147
Latika is jumping the tracks, crossing in front of
trains. But the Thugs are gaining on her. He brings her
down and drags her across to Javed's waiting Mercedes.
Salim is standing by the car. Jamal pushes through the
crowds just in time to see Salim bundling her into the
car.
JAMAL
Salim!
Salim spits disgustedly on the ground. Gets in. Latika
twists her head to see Jamal as the car skids off.
Jamal screams with hopeless fury.
148
149
Waving a kitchen knife in on hand, a desperate Jamal
slams through the gates of Javed's bungalow, the
objecting Doorkeeper running along behind. He bangs
open the front door.
JAMAL
Latika!

150
153
Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the
rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is
thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into
the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at
the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens
screaming.
DIRECTOR
What's going on?
PREM
He's a cheat.
DIRECTOR
This was you? You called them?
Prem shrugs.

You gave him an answer?
PREM
Well, I didn't exactly-
The Director walks away shaking his head. In the
doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.
PREM (CONT'D)
Nita?
But she too turns and walks away.

....alighting on a crowd of hundreds of people jostling
to get a view of the building. News crews are setting

camera.
TV REPORTER
....behind the walls of this
police station lies the mystery
all of India is talking about.
Did Jamal Malik, an uneducated,
eighteen year-old boy from the
slums of Mumbai win one Crore
rupees by fair means or foul?
And in the crowds all around me
there is an even bigger
question. Will he be back on the

Jamal sits silent in the back seat next to the
Inspector as he drives through the traffic. Then:
JAMAL
Truth alone triumphs? I should

The Inspector stops the jeep. Unlocks the handcuffs.
Holds the back door open for Jamal.
INSPECTOR

He nods towards the outside world. Dazed, Jamal gets
