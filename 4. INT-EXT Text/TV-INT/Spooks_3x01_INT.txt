      Oliver Mace is sitting in a comfortable armchair sipping a 
      cup of tea.  A steward brings him a cordless telephone.

      Around her there is chaos. SPECIAL BRANCH OFFICERS are

      Ruth walks along a corridor.  She turns round suddenly.  For 
      a moment a MAN stands at the end of the corridor looking at 
      her.  Then he walks out of sight.  

      She walks on along the corridor.  She comes to a window - 
      white Venetian blinds - and sees Harry lying in bed, his  
      eyes closed.

      Ruth goes to the door.  A SPECIAL BRANCH HEAVY is sitting on 
      a chair.  He holds a heavy communications device.

      the table.  

      SHOT: the camera pans along some of the place markers before

      Defence Intelligence,   M.I.6  and  M.I.5.

      He is a battered looking fifty year-old.  But alcohol has not

                    the evidence is there, prosecuted 
                    for helping the rogue officer 
                    amongst them.

                                  HUGO
                    Are you sure this is in the 
                    interests of National Security?

                                  OLIVER
                      Absolutely.  We cannot have another 
                    Tom Quinn.  So could I have a vote 
                    to authorise the investigation  ...

                                  HUGO
                          (Interrupting)
                    Which is nearly over.  Did the  
                    Prime Minister personally order 
                    this?

                                  OLIVER
                    He is fully informed.

                                  HUGO
                    Not the same thing.

                                  OLIVER
                    Hugo I know you re an old friend of  
                    Harry Pearce so I take your 
                    judgement to be clouded..

                                  HUGO
                    Oh, clouded am I? 

                                  OLIVER
                    Anyone against?

      ignores him.

                                  OLIVER (cont d)
                    Then I proceed.

      CHRISTINE DALE is looking out into the street from behind 
      gauze curtains.  Danny and Zoe are walking away talking 
      animatedly. Her face is ashen with strain.  The C.I.A MAN  
      comes into the room behind her. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      GENERAL POV of the room.  It is full of men.  Recording 
      equipment is on the table.  

                                  CHRISTINE
                    Again and again, I m loyal to the 
                    United States of America, so no, I 
                    didn t help Tom, no, no!

2424

      Zoe is being interrogated in the meeting room by Oliver Mace.  
      She is shouting  No!  No!  No!  

      There are two  SPECIAL BRANCH OFFICERS present.    

      On the table there is a sprawl of tape machines and 
      microphones and the sniper s weapon that killed the Chief Of 
      The Defence Staff.  

      Oliver s interrogation technique is cool but with a steely, 
      mocking edge which is really getting to Zoe.

                                  ZOE
                    I never helped Tom Quinn!

                                  OLIVER
                    So why does your computer reveal so 
                    many visits to sites selling 
                    illegal firearms?  Some personal 
                      pornographic interest?

                                  ZOE
                      Monitoring those sites is part of 
                    my job!

                                  OLIVER
                          (Caressing the rifle)
                    Shall I tell you what I think, Miss 
                    Reynolds?  You procured this gun 
                    for Tom Quinn.

                                  ZOE 
                    How dare you accuse me ...

                                  OLIVER 
                    A little career advice.  Let the 
                    waters close over your time in the 
                    service. And ...   

      Danny comes into the room.  He is very angry.  

                                  DANNY
                    OK that s it!  What s behind this 
                      investigation?  Just what is the 
                    Chair of the JIC doing down here 
                    getting his hands dirty with the 
                    likes of us?

                    Well this is jolly.

      A nod from Oliver and the two Special Branch Officers stand.  
      Big men.

                                  OLIVER (cont d)
                    Mr Hunter, I am minded to have you 
                    arrested.

                                  DANNY
                    For what?

                                  OLIVER
                    The Official Secrets Act is a whole 
                      supermarket of offences.  

                                  DANNY
                    You ve got some kind of hidden 
                    agenda here.  

      And Harry is standing at the open door of the meeting room.  
      He is bandaged about his chest beneath his shirt.  His jacket 
      is draped over his shoulders.  He looks very ill.

                                  HARRY
                    If there is to be an agenda it s 
                    mine.  Oliver, we speak.  Now.  Or 
                    must I embarrass you before junior 
                      personnel?

      A beat.  No one moves.

2525

      Everyone - including the Special Branch officers - is looking 
      at the window in Harry s office.  Inside Harry and Oliver can 
      be seen facing each other.

2626

      Harry and Oliver.

                                  HARRY
                    The JIC will be recalled so I can 
                    defend this department.

                                  OLIVER
                    There s a serious threat to 
                    national security here, I can t

                                  HARRY

                    The moral high ground s a bit of a 
                    sand bank for you, Harry.  The tide

                                  HARRY

      Harry is holding court in the middle of the grid.  Everyone 
      is gathered around, some sitting on desks some standing.

      ADAM CARTER comes across.  He is in his thirties, fit, 
                                                                                              *
      relaxed.  He is often casually but always well dressed - if 
      Adam is wearing trainers they will of a rare brand.  He is a 
      chameleon: an expert at disguise.  Despite his easy manner 
      there is a coiled spring within him.  He smiles but is 
      watchful and can make sudden rapid decisions.  They who like 
      him find him democratic and warm and think he has a heart of 
      gold; they who dislike him suspect there is calculation 
      behind the charm, that he is always reading people and 
      judging how to play them.  Both friends and detractors are 
      right.

      He grins at the company.

                                  ADAM
                    Hello.  How are you doing?

                    We prove Tom Quinn was innocent.

                                  DANNY
                    Yes!

      The others are stunned by Adam s confidence.  Who is this 
      guy?

                                  ADAM 
                    Sorry about this. I think we re in

                    for an all-nighter.  We need a heap

                    What?  Oh, no.

      A big smile.  Sam goes red. And turns away.  The others are 
      turning away.  But Zoe stands her ground.

      personally.

                    Zoe, with Tom, until we really

      Main Hall.  Huge dinosaurs.  Echoes.  

      Harry is waiting, looking up at a vast rib cage.  Hugo 
      Weatherby joins him.

                    There is a conspiracy.  In the

      He crosses himself, bows and turns.

      He sees something.  

      Joyce whips around, a pistol with a silencer already in his 
      hand.

      And Tom comes out of the shadows behind him arm raised to 
      strike.  Joyce hears him and is beginning to turn, so the 
      terrible blow does not catch him fully on the neck.

      The gun spins away across the stone floor.

      Tom puts Joyce into an arm lock and drags him across the 
      floor.  Joyce is in pain. 

                                  JOYCE (cont d)
                    Hey Tom.

                    Shut up!

      Tom reaches the gun.  He drags a half stumbling Hermann to 
      the side of the aisle. 

                                  JOYCE
                    Bright fellow, knowing I d come 
                    here.

                                  TOM
                    I said shut up.

                                  JOYCE
                          (Ignores that)
                    Hey Tom what are you going to do?

                                  TOM 
                    That is the idea.

      Joyce scoffs.

                                  JOYCE 
                    Remember my CV?  A year in the 
                    Lubianka a prisoner of the KGB? You

      Zoe, Danny, Ruth, Malcolm, Colin and Sam have pushed desks 
      together.  There are plates of food, fruit, thermos flasks. 
      It is clear from the food eaten, the plastic cups and the way 
      they are sitting - Adam has his feet up on the table - that 
      they have been going for a few hours.  And it is clear they 
      have been getting nowhere.  Adam lifts a sandwich and bites 
      into it.  Danny lifts a coffee cup.  Zoe turns away.

      SCREEN:

      A video clip is playing upon a computer screen.  A funeral.  
      Many men in big black cloaks.  The video is official.  There 
      is a WOMAN in black - it is CARMEN JOYCE - and a young woman 
      in a wheelchair, who is sobbing.  A nurse leans over the 
      comfort her.

                    The funeral of Hermann Joyce, hero 
                    of the C.I.A.  17th of August, 
                    1999. Official video from the 
                    Library of Congress. Not a dry eye 
                    in the cemetery.

                                  ZOE (V.O.)
                    And here goes the flag to the 
                    widow.

      The American flag, folded, is handed to Carmen.

      CAMERA PULLS BACK.

                    Old school boys putting bugs in 
                    people s trousers?  Dinosaurs.  All 
                    right, you wanted this.  What s so 
                    urgent?

                    Hermann Joyce s body was delivered 
                    to Thames House at midnight.  

      A beat.  

                                  JASON
                    There is no doubt it is the man Tom

                                  OLIVER
                    No doubt.  It  ...  raises the 
                      possibility that Tom Quinn was 
                    innocent.  

                                  JASON
                    Have they hard evidence?  A 
                      confession, a tape?

                                  OLIVER
                    No.  But the truth may be  ...

                                  JASON
                    The truth is the intelligence 
                    services in this country are not 
                    giving the Government what it 
                    wants: clear unambiguous 
                      statements.

                    Raw intelligence is murky, never

                    It s time to dump the old fashioned 
                    spy.

      Christine is being  baby sat.   Three large MEN sit in the 
      room on chairs.  She is on a sofa.  She stares at a bottle of 
      wine before her on a small coffee table. 

      Then with a quick movement she lifts the bottle and the 
      opener.  

      But before she can open it the door opens.  Oliver Mace comes 
      in with the C.I.A MAN whom Danny and Zoe saw.

                                  C.I.A MAN
                      Christine, this is Mr. Oliver Mace 
                    of British Intelligence.  We have 
                    agreed to put your interrogation on

                    Got another glass?

      One of the large men immediately goes to the kitchen.  Oliver  
      takes the bottle of wine from Christine.  The man comes back 
      with a wine glass and puts it on the coffee table.

      Oliver is pouring wine.  The men watch without emotion.


      A chill in the air.

                                  OLIVER (cont d)
                    I can help you.

      He suddenly slaps her on the side of the head, making her ear 
      go dead.  A deliberately brutal blow.  She cries out.  The 
      men in the room are stone.

      A hand touches hers, stopping her.

      She turns.

      Tom is very close to hers, in the semi darkness.  He is

      She gasps.  He puts a hand to his lips.

      He points at the curtains.

      SHOT from Zoe s POV.  Tom looks like a tramp.  A big, dirty

      She is about to react but again he stops her - a quick 
      gesture understood immediately:  is it bugged? 

      She nods.  He shrugs, smiling again, meaning  Let s get

      her go and they hug each other.  And she breaks away 
      abruptly, turned away from him, struggling to control 
      herself.

      A beat.

      Danny opens the door of the flat.  He stops.

      Tom is sprawling on the sofa, his hold-all beside him.  He is 
      drinking a mug of tea. 

                                  TOM
                    Hello Danny.

                    Dead inside, but we don t want to

                    want to go there.

      He smiles.  Danny and Zoe think  what the hell is he talking 
      about? 

                                  DANNY
                    Do you have any idea what we ve

                    Yeah about that.  You see, no 
                    matter how brilliant Joyce was he 
                    had to have a flaw.  Each man kills

                    And I remembered something Harry

                    really brilliant agents, vices and 
                    virtues are linked together.  And 
                    it hit me.  What was Hermann 
                    Joyce s great virtue?  Family love.  
                    For his daughter.  Lisa was a 
                    devout catholic.  She had a 
                    favourite Church. So I staked it 
                    out.  And staked my life on her 
                    father making a sentimental journey 
                    before he disappeared again, into 
                    his faked grave.  And he did.

                    Salu, Adam.  

      Quickly she picks up the pistol, puts the barrel in her mouth 
      and blows her brains out all over the net curtains.

      They are all standing, open mouthed.  Danny is shouting.

                                  DANNY
                    Oh my God!  Oh my God!

      The door is burst open by Special forces.

      He looks at Carmen s body and sits down, thoughtful.

114114

      They have all come running, led by Tom. 

115115

      They burst into the room and stop before the body.

                                  ADAM
                    She and Hermann used to be great.  
                    We all pay the price in different 
                    ways.

      Adam looks up at Tom.  

                                  TOM
                    Yes.

116116

      Tom is sitting at his station, legs out straight.  He looks 
      relaxed.  Zoe, Danny and Ruth are nearby.  There is tension.  
      Tom looks around at the grid.

                                  TOM
                    Do you know, I thought everything 
                    would look completely different.  
                    But it doesn t.

      Harry appears beside Tom.

      He stares at her.  It s dead between them.

      GO TO: Adam thirty yards away, keeping an eye on Christine 
      and Tom.

      RETURN TO Tom and Christine.

                                  CHRISTINE 
                    It nearly destroyed me.  It is 
                      destroying you.

                                  TOM
                    No I m fine.  Dandy.  Cock-a-hoop.

      She looks at him.  There is a flicker in his gaze. 

                                  CHRISTINE
                    Goodbye Tom.

      She turns and walks away.

                    You damn well nearly landed us with  
                      a Ministry of Security running a 
                    secret police.

                                  OLIVER
                    I ...  was perhaps somewhat blinded 
                    by ambition.

                                  HARRY
                       Somewhat  blinded?  

                                  OLIVER
                    You can t force my resignation you 
                    know.  This is only a one all draw.

      Oliver Mace looks away.  A beat.  Then Harry calls.

                                  HARRY 
                    James, one more round I think.  Not 
                    on my tab.
                                                                                              *
