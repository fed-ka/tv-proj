SUPER: THE FRENCH RIVIERA
EXISTING FOOTAGE: Austin and Vanessa gaze at the stars.
AUSTIN
Look how beautiful the night sky is.
VANESSA
Isn't that the big dipper?
AUSTIN
Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus.
VANESSA
Austin!
AUSTIN
(sheepish)
Well, you know.
VANESSA
Hey, I've never seen that big star
before.
AUSTIN
Yeah, what is that?
Austin pulls out his telescope and takes a look.
AUSTIN'S POV - TELESCOPE EFFECT
EXISTING SHOT: The Bob's Big Boy rocket.
The Bob's Big Boy rocket. Suddenly, a hatch opens in Bob's
rear end and Dr. Evil's silver egg capsule poops out.
SFX: PLOOP!
Capsule begins fiery re-entry to Earth
European types stare and point. We see Austin from behind.
His bottom half is blocked by a bicycle. The bicycle moves
away. Just as Austin's bum is about to be revealed-
A CREDIT APPEARS blocking it. Austin turns his head around
to the camera and puts his hand to his mouth in an 'oh my!'
take and we FREEZE FRAME.
A MAN IN A RAINCOAT flashes Austin, his thingy blocked by a
credit. Austin just laughs...crazy, man!
Austin goes around a corner. A moment later he returns,
followed by a NUDE MARCHING BAND.
A SIGN on the left side of the screen reads "Warning! Nude
Beach". Austin enters from the left.
We see his naked, hairy torso from the waist up. Just as he
is about to appear from behind the sign, a...
CREDIT APPEARS MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT Blocking his penis
lengthwise as he walks.
NUDE BEACH - CREDIT SEQUENCE
A girl sits on a blanket; a HORIZONTAL CREDIT blocks her
bare chest. Austin lays on his back beside her, trying to be
suave; A VERTICAL CREDIT appears.
The wind blows away a kite, revealing a stark-naked girl.
The credit "PRODUCTION DESIGN" blocks her chest; the credit
"BY" blocks her you-know-what. Austin walks into frame; the
"PRODUCTION DESIGNER'S NAME" disguises his growing interest.
Austin joins a nude volleyball game in progress. CREDITS
appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of
nudity. People leap in all directions to make saves, causing
CREDITS TO APPEAR at crazy angles.
A pretty girl watches Austin lift weights. Her boobs are
blocked by the "WRITTEN BY" credit.
Austin lifts a dumbbell. The credit "MIKE MYERS" sticks out
from his waist. Austin looks proud.
A BUFF NAKED BODYBUILDER joins them. He lifts a much heavier
weight. A much longer credit sticks out from his waist: "AND
MICHAEL MCCULLERS". Austin pouts.
Austin runs down the beach, his bum blocked by the credit
"DIRECTED BY". He jumps on a trampoline and does the splits
in mid-air:
FREEZE FRAME AND PAN AROUND LIKE IN THE GAP "KHAKI SWING"
AD.
Austin smiles crazily, his penis blocked by "JAY ROACH."
Austin does a super-duper double flip into his JAGUAR.
AUSTIN
Shaguar, baby, yeah!
CU on the chrome script on the grill: it reads "Shaguar"
where it would normally read "Jaguar".
The car speeds off.
FULL SCREEN TV JERRY SPRINGER SHOW
On the stage we see a Klansman father and his Klansman son,
a Nazi father and his Nazi son, and SCOTT EVIL all seated on
a panel.
Lower Third Chyron: "MY FATHER IS EVIL AND WANTS TO TAKE
OVER THE WORLD"
JERRY SPRINGER
If you just joined us, today's topic is "my father is evil
and wants to take over the world". Now, Bobby, you had
something you wanted to share with your father before the
break.
BOBBY
Dad, I know you're against race mixing
and all that, but I met someone...
KLANSMAN
Don't say it!
The crowd WHOOPS.
BOBBY
I met someone... and he's black.
The crowd goes crazy.
KLANSMAN
He?
The Klansman holds his hooded head in his hands.
JERRY SPRINGER
Please welcome Tim.
A handsome Blair Underwood look-alike enters and hugs the
Klansman's son. The crowd screams.
JERRY MOVES TO SCOTT EVIL.
JERRY SPRINGER
Now Scott, tell us about your father.
Share with us.
SCOTT
Well he's the head of an evil
organization that has aspirations
for world domination.
JERRY SPRINGER
And where is your father right now?
SCOTT
He's in outer space, like frozen in
a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big
Boy rocket with his cat, Mr.
Bigglesworth.
JERRY SPRINGER
Really? Well, we have a surprise for
you, Scott. Let's bring out
SCOTT'S
father, Dr Evil.
Dr Evil enters.
Lower Third Chyron: "WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD"
DR. EVIL
Hello Scott, I'm back.
SCOTT
I can't believe you'd do this to me
on national television!
DR. EVIL
They offered me a free makeover.
JERRY SPRINGER
Dr. Evil, we've seen a lot of the
fathers here today open up to their
sons, sons to the fathers. Is there
anything you'd like to share?
DR. EVIL
Share?
JERRY SPRINGER
Yes, don't you have any secrets?
DR. EVIL
OK. I have a vestigial tail.
Everyone is a little grossed out.
DR. EVIL
It's more of a nub, really. The spine
just goes on a little longer than it
should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean,
perform fellatio once and you're a
poet, twice and you're a homosexual.
I remember once I was being fisted
by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where
the story gets interesting. He was
lactose-intolerant. He could eat red
meat all night long, but one sip of
milk and it was gastric hell. And I
remember we were caught in fragrance
delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you
can imagine my humiliation at having
Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no
teeth." One of my greatest
disappointments is that I never became
a song and dance man. I could have
been a quadruple threat, kind of
like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer,
singer, actor, and I would possess
nuclear weapons, the latter being
the most threatening of the four. I
once sat on a bus and tried to will
myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended
up with was a sense of failure and a
mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth
and perhaps a grudging respect for
the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage.
For the most part I distrust dogs. I
slept in a horse once. It was quite
roomy. On second thought, it was the
Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss'
and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I
wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the
Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I
also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy
of The Fonze while I was in coma
after smoking some Peruvian prayer
hash, but who at the end of the day
can honestly say they haven't done
that?
The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once
quiet.
KLANSMAN
What are you, some kind of freak?
SCOTT
Shut up, jagoff!
Studio audience whoops at this.
KLANSMAN
I'll kick your ass punk!
Crowd goes crazy.
DR. EVIL
No one talks to my boy that way!
Dr. Evil charges at Klansman and starts to bitch slap him.
Security men, with headsets on, rush in to separate them.
DR. EVIL
I'm OK, I'm OK.
There is a BEAT, then Dr. Evil CHARGES the guy again, knocking
him down.
DR. EVIL
Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new
evil lair.
We pan up a modern office building. The camera reaches the
top of the building and we see a giant STARBUCKS LOGO and
the words: Starbucks World Headquarters.
We cut outside to see that window is in fact the left eye of
a Mt. Rushmore-type depiction of Dr. Evil carved into the
side of a volcano on a tropical island.
DR. EVIL (V.O.)
(maniacal laugh)
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!
Austin drives in MODERN TRAFFIC. He is drinking a STARBUCKS
COFFEE and listening to the Jag's in-dash CD PLAYER. Suddenly
Austin DROOPS. The car starts to sputter. The fuel gauge
reads empty.
AUSTIN
Gor blimey, I'm on empty! That's
funny, I just filled the Shaguar up
this morning.
Austin hits a button on the dashboard.
BASIL EXPOSITION appears on the picture phone in the dash.
BASIL EXPOSITION
(on picture phone)
Hello, I'm Basil Exposition, head of
British Intelligence.
AUSTIN
You always are, Basil. Listen, the
weirdest thing just happened, I've
run out of petrol.
BASIL EXPOSITION
We'll send a man around immediately.
How was your honeymoon?
AUSTIN
Vanessa tried to kill me, Basil. She
was a Fembot!
BASIL EXPOSITION
Ah women, who can understand them?
Moving on, let's discuss your new
case.
AUSTIN
New case? Very shagadelic, Basil!
BASIL EXPOSITION
You'll be doing a photo shoot. We
know that one of the models is an ex-
KGB agent selling top secret material
to the highest bidder.
AUSTIN
That sounds easy enough, you know
what they say: all work and no
shagging makes Austin a dull boy,
man!
An ambulance races through the streets, SIREN BLARING.
SUPER: "MINISTRY OF DEFENSE"
The Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches
to a stop. A London HIPPIE smoking a hukka watches. He throws
the hukka down. Austin hops out.
AUSTIN
I feel better already, man!
Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being
TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car.
Austin enters the park in high spirits. We PULL BACK to see
that Austin is being watched through binoculars by a big
ARYAN ASSASSIN.
PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal a beautiful MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who
she is.
A sign reads "BE-IN FOR PEACE". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of
all descriptions dance to the music of a PSYCHEDELIC BAND.
The band's name is on the drum kit: "MING TEA."
AUSTIN
Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!
Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of
the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage
and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song:
"SEXUAL REVOLUTION."
Austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number
begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet
Charity or Hair.
AUSTIN
(singing)
'THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, YOU
CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR.
PEOPLE
SHAGGING JUST LIKE WEASELS AND THEY
JUST DON'T SEEM TO CARE.
Hip-thrusting young MOD FREAKS Fosse-hump rhythmically.
AUSTIN
(singing)
HEY, WATCH OUT SQUARES...
YOU MAKES
US BORED!
THE PENIS IS MIGHTIER
THAN THE SWORD
Austin does various groovy dance moves like THE ROCK 'EM
SOCK 'EM ROBOT and THE HEAVYWEIGHT.
AUSTIN
(singing)
THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION AND YOU
AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET PEOPLE SHAGGING
IN THE CLUBS AND INSIDE A JUMBO JET
Forty Austins appear in a KALEIDOSCOPE EFFECT.
AUSTIN
(singing)
HEY SQUARE WORLD THE END IS NIGH.
WHEN WE SAY HUMP YOU SAY 'HOW HIGH?'
Three GROOVY CHICKS behind Austin suddenly have tambourines
for the big finale. The assassin and the mysterious woman
are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin. All we
see of the woman are shots of her BOOTS, CLOTHES, and a FEMALE
SYMBOL MEDALLION.
AUSTIN
(singing)
SO GO MAKE LOVE OR MASTURBATE--
SEXUAL FREEDOM WILL NEVER BE
OUT OF DAAAAAAAAAAATE!
Austin holds the note an improbably long time, arms
outstretched.
The dancers crouch-walk towards the camera.
EVERYONE
(chanting)
FREE-- LOVE!
(louder)
FREE-- LOVE!
(louder)
FREE-- LOVE!
(shouting)
IT'S THE SIXTIES!
The SONG ENDS and all the dancers end up on one knee with
their arms outstretched, panting. Austin breathes heavily
and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.
We are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is
the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN who is watching Austin's ass. She SMILES
behind the binoculars hiding her face.
Austin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM.
Sitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN.
The Aryan assassin nods to a SHOE-SHINE on the street.
The shoe-shine boy nods to a BUSINESS MAN in a Homburg.
The business man nods to a BOBBY.
The bobby nods to a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE.
The woman with a baby carriage nods to a MIME.
The mime nods to a BLIND BEGGAR with a tin cup.
The blind beggar nods to a CARPENTER on a roof.
The carpenter FLASHES A LIGHT to an INDIAN CHIEF.
The Indian Chief gives a SMOKE SIGNAL to a TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.
The telegraph operator sends a signal to the BEEFEATER GUARD.
The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR
on a double-decker bus.
The sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER.
The taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by.
Austin walks along. Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at
him.
He dives out of the way and takes off running. He rounds
a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a
wall by hugging himself.
The assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his
gun.
Austin turns as he hears a car HONK.
It's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps
out.
We see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a
sight it is. She has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing
suit, unzipped just enough to show the female symbol
medallion.
She is FELICITY SHAGWELL.
MUSIC: FELICITY'S THEME
FELICITY
Care for a ride?
AUSTIN
That's my Beetle, baby.
FELICITY
It was your Beetle. Get in.
Austin dives in as the assassin FIRES. The car speeds off.
The Beetle zips along, and then-- the Citroen appears behind
it.
The assassin FIRES.
The assassin's tire BLOWS. The car skids towards a Cliff and
he jumps out as it goes over.
The car goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three
times before it EXPLODES.
The assassin hangs on to a branch with one hand. He falls.
ASSASSIN
Ahhhhhhhh!
Same shot as the car: The assassin's body goes over and
tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three times before it, too,
EXPLODES.
FELICITY
Well, Austin, I think this time you
may have met your match.
AUSTIN
Oh, I've beaten Dr. Evil before, and
I'll beat him again.
FELICITY
I was talking about me.
She smiles, turns, and walks away.
Austin's plane in flight.
Austin and Felicity drive against obvious rear screen
projection of India.
Literally a window in a wall. Fat Bastard is placing his
order.
FAT BASTARD
...and I'll have a fried-prawn
sandwich, with extra mayonnaise, two
whole chickens, a kidney pie, a toad
in the hole, bubble and squeak,
bangers and mash, 3 orders of fish
and chips, and... a Fresca. No ice.
We pan to see Felicity beside him.
FELICITY
I love a man with a large appetite.
FAT BASTARD
And I love a woman with big (bleeps),
so let's shut up and get to
(bleep)ing.
Felicity swallows hard and forces a smile.
They land with a THUD. Robin cushions Austin's fall. Oedipus
is dead on the pavement.
ROBIN SWALLOWS
Oedipus, Oedipus...
AUSTIN
Sorry baby, too late. He's as dead
as vaudeville.
ROBIN SWALLOWS
You can't win, Powers. Dr. Evil has
your mojo and it's only a matter of
time before he kills you and takes
over the world.
(weak)
Tell Fat Bastard I'll miss him...
CUT TO:
Austin and Felicity walk along the street.
FELICITY
Austin, tell me about the Nineties.
AUSTIN
You know I can't tell you details
about the future, baby, it could
alter history.
FELICITY
Not details, just what it's like.
You know, what's the scene?
Where's
it at?
AUSTIN
There've been a lot of advances in
the Nineties, baby. The economy is
stable, people take better care of
their health concern for the
environment is on the rise and, um,
let's see, there's an entire
television channel dedicated to golf.
FELICITY
Sounds awful.
AUSTIN
It's not so bad once you get used to
it. The Nineties are about
responsibility. You know, having
respect for yourself and other people.
I even got married.
FELICITY
You? Married? What about the sexual
revolution?
AUSTIN
Well, it turns out there were some
casualties, baby. Don't you think
you'll ever get married?
FELICITY
No, not until I get a little more
'experience' under my belt.
AUSTIN
Oh, behave!
Suddenly Austin notices something outside and puts his hand
to his mouth in fear.
AUSTIN
(wide-eyed)
Oh my God!
Felicity is immediately on her guard. She pulls her gun.
FELICITY
(looking around)
What is it! Is it Fat Bastard?
AUSTIN
No, written here on my hand, see?
Austin turns his hand around to show her. He has written 'oh
my God' on his hand with the pen.
AUSTIN
Says 'Oh my God!'
They laugh.
FELICITY
Austin, look.
Austin and Felicity duck into a CAMERA SHOP and come out an
instant later with SUPER-8 CAMERAS.
They run down the street filming each other.
AUSTIN AND FELICITY - SUPER-8 MONTAGE
This is a Richard Lester-like sequence shot on grainy film
from Austin and Felicity's POVs.
There's lots of SPEEDED UP stuff and POPPING IN AND OUT of
frame like the MONKEES TV show.
BACK ON THE STREET
AUSTIN
Felicity, I haven't had this much
fun since I worked undercover in
Amsterdam-- '66 I think it was.
FELICITY
1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch
cheese expert to stop Dr.
Evil from
poisoning the world's water supply.
Austin is impressed.
FELICITY
I've studied your file, Austin. I
want to be a trailblazer, just like
you.
The Seventies are right around
the corner. It's going to be a
glorious time for fashion and music
and technology-- it won't be long
before every flying car has its own
8-track.
Austin starts to say something, then bites his tongue.
FELICITY
The CIA has always been a boy's club
until now. Well move over, this
chick's taking over.
AUSTIN
(hoarse)
Very impressive.
FELICITY
Austin, your voice!
AUSTIN
Yes, I think I'm coming down with
something.
Austin and Felicity stop at an ICE CREAM MAN with his
pushcart.
AUSTIN
I'll get some ice cream. Would you
like some?
FELICITY
No thanks.
AUSTIN
(hoarse, to ice cream
man)
Could I have two scoops of Vanilla,
please?
ICE CREAM MAN
Right away, governor. Would you like
chocolate syrup?
AUSTIN
(hoarse)
Yes, please.
ICE CREAM MAN
Will you have any whipped cream?
AUSTIN
(hoarse)
I will, thank you.
ICE CR@ MAN
Candy sprinkles?
AUSTIN
(hoarse)
Yes please.
ICE CREAM MAN
Crushed nuts?
AUSTIN
No, laryngitis.
ICE CREAM MAN
Here's your change, sir. Oh, and
Austin--
We cut back to the ICE CREAM MAN to see him pulling off a
very fake beard. It is BASIL (though it was clearly another
actor before).
AUSTIN
(now with phlegmy
throat)
Basil!
BASIL EXPOSITION
Hello, Austin. What's wrong with
your voice?
AUSTIN
(still phlegmy throat)
I just had ice cream. Listen to me,
I have dairy throat.
"Mary had a
little lamb and it was always
gruntin'. She tied it to a five bar
gate and kicked it's little-
BASIL EXPOSITION
(Interrupting)
Austin! Things are heating up, so I
thought it best to contact you in
disguise. Felicity, your plan worked.
You and Austin track Fat Bastard
back to Dr. Evil.
AUSTIN
But how can we track Fat Bastard?
FELICITY
I planted a homing device on him
last night.
BASIL EXPOSITION
Yes, and we're starting to pick up
the signal now.
Basil hands Felicity a tracking device that BEEPS.
AUSTIN
How did you get close enough to plant
a homing device?
FELICITY
I shagged him, I shagged him rotten.
Austin and Basil are confused and grossed out at the same
time.
AUSTIN
You... him? Just like that?
FELICITY
Yes, Austin, we needed that
information.
BASIL EXPOSITION
Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity,
we now know that-
AUSTIN
(interrupting, to
Felicity)
Did you use an elaborate set of
pulleys? A block and tackle?
BASIL EXPOSITION
Anyway, you two follow the signal
back to Dr. Evil's headquarters and
then-
AUSTIN
(interrupting, to
Felicity)
I just can't get my head around it,
baby. You're so small and he's so
... not small. The sheer mechanics
of it are mindboggling!
BASIL EXPOSITION
Never mind, Austin, you two have
work to do. You must find Dr.
Evil.
We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen.
The Beetle comes from under the water and lands on the beach.
We still hear the BEEP-BEEP.
Austin and Felicity have set up a tent with a view of the
Dr.
Evil Mt. Rushmore face. Austin is looking at the mountain
through a pair of binoculars which hang around his neck.
AUSTIN
According to the readings, Dr. Evil's
headquarters is over the next ridge.
FELICITY
Can I have a look?
AUSTIN
Sure.
Austin hands her the binoculars. Unfortunately the strap is
still around his neck, pulling his face into her cleavage.
FELICITY
Question is, how do we get in?
AUSTIN
(muffled)
Mmmmmmm...mmmmm...
FELICITY
Austin, did you hear me?
AUSTIN
I seem to be stuck in your dirty
pillows.
FELICITY
Where are the topographical maps
that Basil drew up?
AUSTIN
I think they're in the tent.
He and Felicity enter the tent. A LIGHT is on inside casting
shadows of Austin and Felicity on the side of the tent. From
the outside it appears the shadow Austin is leaning over
with his back to-the shadow Felicity, who appears to have
her hands up his butt.
AUSTIN (V.O.)
Have you got it out yet?
FELICITY (V.O.)
Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things
do you put in there?
The shadow Felicity appears to be tugging a string of sausage
links from his ass.
AUSTIN (V.O.)
Oh, anything that catches my fancy.
FELICITY (V.O.)
How do you manage to fit it all in?
AUSTIN (V.O.)
Oh, it stretches to fit.
The shadow Felicity appears to pull a tennis racket out of
Austin's ass.
AUSTIN (V.O.)
Are you almost done? I can't hold it
much longer.
We see the shadows again. It now looks like Felicity is
putting things into Austin's ass.
FELICITY (V.O.)
Do you want everything to go back
in?
AUSTIN (V.O.)
Yes. Listen, Felicity, about Fat
Bastard-
FELICITY (V.O.)
It's my job, Austin. You of all people
should understand that.
Marakesh,
1962. Rome, 1964. Tokyo, 1966. I
know your record backwards and
forwards.
You've had more sex on
the job than a Swedish stewardess.
The shadow Felicity tries to cram the tennis racket into
what appears to be Austin's ass.
AUSTIN (V.O.)
You're right, Felicity, I can't deny
it. But the world changed, and I
changed too.
Pull back to reveal that THE HE-BOTS are watching. Felicity
shoves the tennis racket extra hard.
Austin stands up rapidly.
AUSTIN (V.O.)
Ow!
(beat)
My back hurts.
FELICITY (V.O.)
Are you OK?
AUSTIN (V.O.)
I'm fine, just keeping packing.
The He-Bots shrug their shoulders and march towards the tent.
NUMBER TWO (V.O.)
Two, one, liftoff!
The rocket lifts off from the volcano into the night sky.
The rocket in flight.
FULL SCREEN - NORAD TRACKING SCREEN
The rocket enters the screen. It has the silhouette of a
flying penis.
MAN
Pecker!
WOMAN
Where?
He raises his binoculars.
MAN
Over there. A rare red-billed
woodpecker!
(looks over with
binoculars)
What sort of bird is that? Oh
goodness, it's not a bird, it's-
CUT TO:
SERGEANT
Privates! We have reports of an
Unidentified Flying Object. It has a
long, smooth shaft, complete with-
UMPIRE
Two balls! No strikes.
(looking up)
What is that? It looks just like an
enormous--
CUT BACK TO:
Austin and Felicity run up to the Beetle.
AUSTIN
Hold on, I have something very
important to do.
Austin drinks the mojo.
FELICITY
How do you feel?
AUSTIN
Sound as a pound, my spuds are
boiling. Fancy a shag?
FELICITY
Austin, we don't have time.
AUSTIN
C'mon, luv, let's hop on the good
foot and do the bad thing!
FELICITY
Dr. Evil's taken his laser to the
moon. The world is in danger.
AUSTIN
Right, the moon. I think I know
someone who can give us a lift.
The Apollo ready for lift-off.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
There's been some sort of delay in
the launch of Apollo 11, Walter, but
we understand that America's first
manned mission to the moon will be
blasting off shortly.
The rocket lifts off.
MISSION COMMANDER (V.O.)
We have lift-off! Apollo 11 has
cleared the tower and is heading for
a rendezvous with the moon.
The stages separate.
The lunar module settles on the moon.
AUSTIN (V.O.)
Mission control, the swinger has
landed.
Austin and Felicity step out in their spacesuits.
AUSTIN
This is one small step for man, but
a giant step for shagging.
Can you
imagine it, baby, weightless? The
permutations are mind-boggling.
FELICITY
Naughty boy!
Austin plants a UNION JACK on the moon.
AUSTIN
God Save the Queen.
The laser beam hits the Big Boy Rocket in the crotch and Big
Boy's eyes cross in pain.
Austin emerges from the TIME PORTAL to see Dr. Evil getting
into a car. Austin waves his hands and a 1974 RED FORD TORINO
with a white stripe pulls over.
AUSTIN
I have to commandeer this vehicle.
(noticing)
Hey, aren't you Hutch?
VOICE (O.S.)
No.
We see PAUL MICHAEL GLASER (STARSKY).
PAUL MICHAEL GLASER
I'm Starsky.
DAVID SOUL
I'm Hutch.
Austin jumps in and the Torino speeds off. Dr. Evil's car
disappears into a car wash which is a TIME PORTAL. The Torino
follows.
A sign at the car wash reads: "1911"
CUT TO:
Passengers in period garb walk past a lifesaver with "Titanic"
stenciled above it. Dr. Evil enters through a portal with
Austin hot on his heels.
CAPTAIN (O.S.)
Iceberg, dead ahead!
Suddenly the ship tilts at a radical angle. LEONARDO DICAPRIO,
KATE WINSLET, and JAMES CAMERON slide by.
JAMES CAMERON
I'm king of the world!
Dr. Evil and Austin slide backwards into the TIME PORTAL
they just came from.
CUT TO:
Dr. Evil runs into the street with Austin chasing him. In
SLO-MO Austin dives for a ridiculously long time, and TACKLES
Dr.
Evil, pinning him.
AUSTIN
I'm going to kill you, you bastard!
DR. EVIL
(breathing heavily)
Before you do that, know this: Austin,
I am... your... father.
MUSIC: DRAMATIC STING
AUSTIN
Really?
DR. EVIL
No. I can't back that up. I was just
grasping at straws. I had nothing.
But isn't it interesting, Mr. Powers,
you really have become a product of
the Nineties.
AUSTIN
How so?
DR. EVIL
You're more interested in your job
as glorified policeman than you are
in love. You won the battle, but I
won the war. Love means nothing,
you've proved it.
AUSTIN
I didn't think that Felicity was
going to die, man.
DR. EVIL
What a cowardly response. I'm
disappointed really. You have the
power to go back in time and save
her, but it means letting me go.
Austin looks over and sees a TIME PORTAL. Through it he can
glimpse the lair, and Felicity.
DR. EVIL
Well, Mr. Powers, which is it going
to be? Me or the girl?
AUSTIN
Felicity!
Austin runs through.
CUT TO:
The Big Boy Rocket spins to avoid the laser as it passes
harmlessly by.
Dr. Evil's escape rocket in flight.
FULL SCREEN - RADAR
Dr. Evil's rocket enters the screen. It has the silhouette
of a flying penis.
RACHEL HUNTER
Rod?
ROD STEWART
Yes, Rachel?
RACHEL HUNTER
(pointing to sky)
What's that?
