TORTURE ROOM #1
1
CLOSE ON - A YOUNG WOMAN'S EYE. Bloodshot blue. Her
eyelashes tremble. A tear rolls out. She blinks.
CLOSE ON - A filthy, coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside
her mouth.
CLOSE ON - The same type rope binds her ankles together.
CLOSE ON HER HANDS - A mixture of blood, dirt.
IRON SPIKES
ARE NAILED THROUGH HER PALMS.
FROM ABOVE - The Young Woman, 20s, wearing a handmade dress
with a small crest embroidered over the heart, lies nailed to
a wooden table.
AN OVERHEAD LIGHT BULB DIMS, CRACKLES.
OFF SCREEN: A BLOOD-
CURDLING SCREAM cries out.
The Young Woman's breathing intensifies.
She watches the
light bulb, listens to the screams.
The light bulb returns to normal. The screams stop.
Peace
for a moment. But she knows that won't last.

TORTURE ROOM #2
2
A YOUNG MAN, 20s, hangs by his wrists from iron shackles
secured to the ceiling. He's bloodied, bruised... a mess.
CLOSE ON - The end of a pair of jumper cables. They TOUCH,
sending SPARKS into the air. Brought together by...
A CONCEALED FIGURE. All that's visible are his hands.
His
left hand is SEVERELY BURNED, SCARRED, while his right
appears normal. He touches the jumper cables together
again... SPARKS FLY.
YOUNG MAN
Please-please stop. D-don't.
The Concealed Figure ignores his pleas, connects the left
cable to one shackle chain... and then the right side.
ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE BODY OF THE YOUNG MAN. HIS
BODY CONTORTS. HE SCREAMS. The lights DIM and CRACKLE.

CLOSE ON - The light bulb DULLS.
The screams of the Young
Man echo through the room.
2.
The Young Woman closes her eyes. Takes SEVERAL FAST BREATHS
then... MUSTERS every ounce of strength in her body and...
Her right hand TREMBLES... The Young Woman GRIMACES, in
unbelievable agony, but then... HER RIGHT HAND INCHES UP THE
IRON SPIKE. Slowly and painfully. PIECES OF BLOOD, SKIN and
BONE cling to spike as the hand moves up.
The light bulb returns again to normal.
The screams stop.
The Young Woman gives a final hard push and...
FREES HER
RIGHT HAND. Blood pours from the wound.
No time to waste. She turns her attention, strength to her
left hand... ever-so-slowly (and painfully) it moves.

TORTURE ROOM #2

CLOSE ON - The jumper cable attaches to the metal and...
ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE YOUNG MAN'S body. HE SCREAMS.

CABIN - TORTURE ROOM #1
5
The Young Woman's left hand POPS free.
Blood oozes out.
OFF SCREEN: SCREAMS FROM THE YOUNG MAN.
She sits up, goes for the gag, but her fingers cramp in pain.
Finally, she unties the knot, removes the gag. She coughs,
tries to muffle the noise best she can.
The SCREAMS STOP.
Lights return to normal.
Half way free. She goes for the ropes at her ankles, unties
them, slides off the table. She grabs a couple rags, ties
them around her palm's wounds.
6
HALLWAY/ TORTURE ROOM #2
6
The Young Woman opens the door, checks to see if the coast is
clear. It is.
We're at the end of a long, dark hallway (more like a tunnel,
really). There are two more doors in the hall, one in front
of her another to her right. The door across from her is
slightly ajar...
YOUNG WOMAN'S POV THRU DOOR - The Young Man dangles from the
chains. Suddenly, the Concealed Figure appears between the
door and the Young Man.
The Young Woman retreats, but realizes the Concealed Figure
has his back to her.
3.
THE YOUNG MAN sees past the Figure, LOCKS EYES with the Young
Woman. No hope for himself, his eyes say: Save yourself.
The Young Woman fights back tears, mouths the words "I Love
you". She carefully opens the door to her right, REVEAL a
rickety set of wooden steps. She heads up, just as...
LIGHTS FLICKER.
OFF SCREEN: The Young Man SCREAMS again.
The Young Woman quickens her pace. The SCREAMS drown out any
sound, until... just before she touches THE TOP STEP...
The lights return to NORMAL.
The Young Man STOPS screaming.
The place goes silent.
The Young Woman's foot TOUCHES THE STEP...
A LOUD CREAK
RINGS OUT. The Young Woman FREEZES.

TORTURE ROOM #2--

The Concealed Figure TURNS towards the sound.

HALLWAY, STAIRS--

The Young Woman holds her breath.
Did he hear her?
9
TORTURE ROOM #2--
9
A STEEL AXE/SICKLE hybrid (a scary, handmade invention),
rusted, save for the razor sharp edge, sticks in a nearby
wooden horse. The Concealed Figure SNATCHES the weapon.
YOUNG MAN
SARAH!
RUN!
10
HALLWAY, STAIRS--

Sarah (Young Woman) bolts up the remaining steps.

TORTURE ROOM #2--

The Concealed Figure rushes for the door.
In pursuit.
SMASH CUT TO:

RANGER BASE STATION - DAY
18
Maps and local artifacts adorn the walls. A display of some
of the local animals, stuffed of course, including a giant
bear, fill in the gaps.
Mike and Sheryl enter. They take in the place. Mike heads
toward the Ranger's desk while Sheryl eyes the decor.
SAM, 65, a round-faced RANGER with a grumpy disposition, a
hearing aid in his right ear, sits behind a desk. He
continues working, scribbling on something as Sheryl and Mike
wait. And wait. Then...
MIKE
Good morning.
Sam holds up a "wait a second" finger.
After a beat...
SAM
Now what can I do you two for?
Sheryl spots some fliers tacked to a bulletin board. Hiking
gear for sale, Tour Info, National Park History, etc.
MIKE
Well...ah...
SAM
First time here and you're not quite
sure where to begin.
Sheryl grabs a National Park Information flier.
ANGLE ON - There are pictures, an Emergency Contact
Information, Guided Tour Info, etc.
SAM
Something like that.
SHERYL
Precisely like that.
Sam stands, grabs his lower back, a recurring discomfort.
As
he digs around for something...
SHOOTING SCRIPT
OCTOBER 17, 2006

Sheryl notices, on the board...
ANGLE ON - A flier for a young missing couple.
Below that...
ANGLE ON - A photo of a girl: "Sarah Travers"(from the
opening scene).
Sheryl studies it and shakes off any concern by locking arms
with Mike at the desk.
SAM
Get you started with one of these.
Sam grabs a map and lays it out in front of the couple.
SAM
How long you folks hiking for?
MIKE
Two days.
Heading out early Sunday.
SAM
Well, if you move at a decent clip,
you could hit the summit by midday
tomorrow. Should still give you time
to take it all in and make it down.
SHERYL
Any particular path?
SAM
You folks experienced hikers?
MIKE
We've done some ah--
SHERYL
(interrupting)
No. Nothing like this.
SAM
For first-timers, I recommend either
Willow Creek Bridge or Donner Trail.
SHERYL
Donner Trail? As in "The Donner
Party?"
SAM
I'm not sure of the name's origin.
They're the two paths we regularly
patrol. Something happens and you're
on one of the other trails, it might
be awhile before we find you.
9.
MIKE
Where do we camp?
SAM
Unless it says not to, you can set up
where you like. Just make sure when
you turn in that you extinguish your
fire. Oh, and this here's bear
country. They're not animals to fool
with. You see one, you head the other
way, especially if he's feeding. If
the bear thinks you're getting in the
way of his food, that's all she wrote.
Sheryl warily eyes the stuffed Bear in the station.
SHERYL
(Sarcastic)
Great.
SAM
You got yourself a first aid kit?
MIKE
Nurse Betty here's my first aid kit.
Sam looks confused...
SHERYL
Don't mind him. I'm a nurse.
SAM
Good for you. The question was, do
you have a first aid kit?
SHERYL
Yes, we have a first aid kit.
SAM
Great, see how easy that was.
(Moving on)
It's off-season, park's pretty quiet.
Even more than usual. You may run
into a few locals, but--
SHERYL
People live up here?
SAM
We have a few generations of families
that have called these mountains home.
Most of `em are friendly. Respect their
land and they'll respect you.
10.
Mike twangs and air banjos, "Dueling Banjos" from
`Deliverance.' Sam is not amused. Sheryl fights her
temptation to laugh.
MIKE
Sorry.
SAM
(Moving on)
Base is just outside, to the left. At
about two miles up there'll be a
junction where you can pick your path.
MIKE
Thanks.
Mike and Sheryl offer a smile and quickly exit.

TENT - NIGHT
34
Sheryl pulls off her sweatshirt, then the T-shirt.
Mike
kicks off his shoes, drops his pants.
Mike unbuttons Sheryl's jeans, tugs them off.
Sheryl unhooks her bra, tosses it aside.
Mike slides her
panties down her legs and off.
33.
Few things in life can be described as perfect.
Sheryl's
naked body is one of them.
Sheryl pulls Mike's boxers down, climbs on top of him.
She
reaches down and slides Mike inside her.
Sheryl KISSES Mike. He slides his hands around Sheryl's
butt. Sheryl paws his chest, bites his lower lip HARD.
The lovers move in unison.
Perfection.
35
36
Breaths get shorter, stronger. Sheryl and Mike build to
climax. They don't/ can't notice...
A SHADOW passes across the wall of the tent.
The last final moments before... climax. The lovers EXHALE.
Sheryl crashes on top of Mike. He wraps his arms tightly
around her.
TIME CUT TO:

TENT - NIGHT
36 B
Mike and Sheryl spoon, their hands and fingers messed
together as one.
MIKE
I was good. I mean, even better than
usual.
SHERYL
If you don't say so...
MIKE
... if I don't say so myself, yeah.
Top notch performance. What, you
disagree?
34.
SHERYL
Nah, it was good.
Do you think I had
anything to do...
MIKE
No.
All me.
SHERYL
Fine.
(Beat; cautious)
I liked what the old woman said about
us earlier.
MIKE
What did she say?
SHERYL
That she thought we were married.
MIKE
(Groans)
You are relentless.
Mike gets up, starts dressing.
SHERYL
I wouldn't be a proper girlfriend if I
didn't nag every now and then.
MIKE
I get it, but it makes me feel like
the bad guy every time. Which makes
me feel like shit.
SHERYL
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
Where
are you going?
MIKE
Do out there, what you did in here.
SHERYL
What's that?
MIKE
Put out the fire.
Mike exits.
Sheryl lies back down, exhales in frustration.
37
Mike compares his
boot to it. It's not the same size.
Mike surveys the area. All's quiet now. But an uneasy
feeling has crept back into his bones. Mike climbs back
inside the tent, zips it shut.
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
38
TENT - DAY
39
Sheryl's eyes SNAP open. She's nestled comfortably in Mike's
arms. He's still asleep.
40
TENT - DAY
42
Mike opens his eyes. Something woke him up, not exactly sure
what. He sits up and yawns, stretches his stiff body. He's
alone in the tent.
43
IDA'S CABIN - DAY
55
CLOSE ON - Mike's eyes SNAP open, dart side to side, blink.
REVEAL - Mike lays on a ragged couch.
The place is dark and
dusty. A glance around...
Gaslights hang in the corners. A stack of logs rest next to
an old fireplace. Just off the main room is a kitchen
alcove, with a coal stove. On the stove a WHISTLING TEAPOT.
Mike's memory slowly comes back.
He leans up when...
MIKE
Ow!
43.
A sharp pain shoots through his body. Mike reaches for his
leg. The tourniquet conceals the damage. A damn towel is
wrapped around where the wound is. A bandage has replaced
the Gray Bandana on his arm.
Ida enters the cabin from the back door, into the kitchen.
She removes the teapot from the burner. The whistling stops.
IDA
Look who's up.
MIKE
Where am I?
IDA
You're in my home, Michael. You gave
me quite a scare. I thought I lost
you.
Ida grabs a wet wash cloth, wrings it out over a basin and
walks back to Mike.
IDA
Lucky the snap didn't break the bone,
just bruised it. I know that's of
little comfort now, but trust me, it's
a good thing. That dirty trap
however's prime for spreading
infection, need to finish cleaning out
that wound and then I'll get some
"evening primrose" in you. Same stuff
the Indian Tribes used it back in the
day to heal, well... just about
everything. So's do I.
Ida unwraps the tourniquet, examines the wound.
IDA
Try and relax.
Ida cleans the wound.
Mike winces.
He can't watch.
MIKE
Thank you.
For saving my life.
IDA
You don't have to thank me. Up here,
we take care of one another. That's
the only way any of us survive.
MIKE
Um...
(Thinks...)
I'm sorry, but I don't know your name.
SHOOTING SCRIPT
OCTOBER 17, 2006
44.
IDA
Oh for the sake of sunshine... how
rude a host am I? Name's Ida Foster.
Ida moves to the kitchen, grabs a mason jar with clear
liquid. It looks just like the jar Mike bought from Brody.
MIKE
Ida, I need some help.
IDA
I'm moving as fast as I can, sweetie.
MIKE
No, not me. It's Sheryl. My
girlfriend. You met her with me
yesterday. Something's happened to
her. She was gone this morning when I
woke up. I looked everywhere and I
couldn't find her. We need to call
someone. A Ranger. Somebody. We
need to find her right away. Do you
have a phone?
IDA
I'm sorry, but I don't. Never really
had use for one.
(Beat)
I do have a radio. We can call down
to base if you'd like.
Ida comes back to the couch.
IDA
After we take care of you.
MIKE
I'm fine, Ida, please... if you could
call now.
IDA
You want to lose this leg? Cause
that's what you're risking. Soon as
we're done, I'll call. Okay?
Mike concedes.
Ida hands a second rag to Mike.
IDA
Bite down on this... I ain't gonna
lie... Lotta pain about to hit you
sweetheart.
45.
Mike puts the rag in his mouth. Ida dips the used cloth in
the moonshine. He closes his eyes TIGHT, and... Ida applies
the moonshine to the wound.
Mike SCREAMS through the cloth.
IDA
It's okay.
It's almost over.
Ida repeats. Mike SCREAMS again. His eyes water.
Ida offers her palm.
Mike opens his mouth.
The cloth falls
into her hand.
Mike BREATHES HEAVILY, coming down from the pain.
Ida crosses to the kitchen, disposes of the two wash cloths
and grabs a larger towel. She walks back to Mike and wraps
his calf with the towel.
IDA
We'll get some of that primrose in you
and you'll be good as new.
MIKE
Ida? The radio. Please... Can you
call down please?
IDA
I'll take care of it right now.
Ida heads to a closed door on the far side of the room.
She
opens and enters, sure to close the door behind her.
Mike relaxes, as best he can anyway.
Until...
KNOCK, KNOCK.
BRODY (OS)
Ida, you in there?!
MIKE'S POV - Through a small slit in the drapes, Brody waits
outside.
Ida exits the room, heads for the door.
MIKE
(Whispers)
He's looking for me.
IDA
(Whispers; concerned)
Why's that?
46.
BRODY (OS)
Ida!
MIKE
(Whispers)
I think he had something to do with
Sheryl going missing.
KNOCK, KNOCK.
IDA
(Whispers)
I'll take care of it.
BRODY (OS)
Ida, lemme in!
IDA
I'm coming!
Ida helps Mike stand, re-directs him to the kitchen alcove.
He winces all the way. She leans him up against the near
wall so that he is out of view of the door.
Ida goes to the front door, opens it halfway, revealing an
agitated Brody, shotgun in hand.
Suspicious, Brody tries to peek past Ida into the cabin.
She
doesn't budge.
BRODY
What took you so long?
IDA
What do you want, Brody?
BRODY
I'm looking for a man hiker.
IDA
This "man hiker" alone or wit someone?
BRODY
He had a lady friend, but...
I'm just
looking for him now.
ON MIKE - Listening nervously.
IDA
Well, I ain't seen no one in days.
Brody glares at her. She glares right back. Brody again
tries to see past her into the cabin, but she blocks him.
47.
IDA
What'd he do you for anyway?
BRODY
He busted Darryl's face in with a
shotgun. Left him a mess of blood and
teeth. Nearly killed him.
(Beat)
You spot anyone you don't know, you be
sure to find me.
IDA
Fine.
Brody eyeballs Ida one last time, then leaves. Ida watches
him go, closes the door and heads to the alcove.
IDA
He's gone. Brody and those boys are a
pain in the backside. I'm sure that
cousin of his had it coming.
Ida leads Mike back to the couch.
MIKE
What did the Ranger say? Does he need
to speak to me? When is he coming?
Ida heads back to the kitchen, grabs a mug and pours hot
water into it. She dishes a small spoonful of yellow powder
into the hot water.
IDA
Sorry, I wasn't able to reach anyone.
Ida stirs the powder in as she walks back to Mike.
MIKE
God damnit!
Ida pauses...then:
IDA
Please don't take the Lord's name in
vain in this house.
She GLARES LONG, COLD and HARD at Mike, until...
MIKE
I'm sorry.
IDA
Drink this.
48.
Ida hands him the steaming mug.
Mike's mind races.
MIKE
Something's not right.
IDA
I'm sure they're just on rounds and
will be back any minute. We'll try
them again and we'll find Sheryl.
You'll see. She probably just took a
wrong turn up here, ended up in the
middle of "don't know where." Happens
lots of times.
(Looks to the mug)
Please drink up, Michael, it will make
you feel better.
Mike holds the mug, stares at the drink. He puts it to his
lips but then stops, looks at Ida. She stares at him.
Unnerved by the stare, Mike lowers the mug without sipping.
IDA
What's wrong?
MIKE
How did you know my name?
IDA
(Confused)
Excuse me?
MIKE
Michael. You keep calling me Michael.
You did it just now. You did before,
just after I woke up. You called me
Michael. Nobody calls me Michael.
IDA
I'm sure you're mistaken.
You musta
told me before.
MIKE
No, I would have told you "Mike."
Only my grandmother, who's dead, ever
called me Michael.
IDA
Well, how else could I have known your
name?
ANGLE ON - IDA'S BOOTS.

MIKE
(Beat; thinks...)
On my driver's license and credit
cards, it says Michael. If you stole
my wallet from the campsite... that's
how you'd have known.
Long beat.
IDA
You're accusing me of stealing your
wallet? I saved your life. Twice.
Why would I steal your wallet?
(Mike doesn't respond)
Now, just drink your primrose...
MIKE
Fuck the primrose!
Mike TOSSES the mug across the room.
It SHATTERS.
Mike lifts himself up. Despite the pain, he heads for the
room Ida went in to make the radio call.
IDA
Where do you think you're going?
MIKE
I want to call the Ranger myself.
IDA
NO!
Ida springs to her feet, jumps in front of Mike.
MIKE
I'm getting in that room, Ida.
Mike maneuvers around her, when... Ida grabs the iron fire
poker by the stove, holds it like a baseball bat.
IDA
I can't let you in there.
Mike takes a step forward. Ida SWINGS the poker. Nearly
hits Mike. Mike jukes left, she SWINGS again. Misses.
MIKE
Where is Sheryl, Ida?
She's in that
room, isn't she?
IDA
You sinners are all alike. I heard
you last night. Spitting in the face

IDA'S CABIN - DAY

Suddenly, Ida appears in a new light...
IDA
You and your bitch whore girlfriend
will atone for your sins.
Mike LUNGES forward, grabs hold of the poker before Ida can
swing it again.
THEY STRUGGLE, CRASH UP AGAINST THE WALL!
The poker falls to
the floor.
Ida JUMPS on Mike's back, wraps her arms around his throat.
Mike spins Ida around in circles, then SLAMS Ida up against
the wall. The two fall to the floor.
Mike pushes himself up, but before he can get away...
IDA GRABS HOLD OF HIS BEAR TRAP WOUND, SQUEEZES!
MIKE SCREAMS IN AGONY! Instinctively, Mike kicks Ida in the
face, boot to nose. Ida's head snaps back, then falls face
first on the floorboard.
Mike is PANTING, glances at Ida.
She's out cold.
Mike pushes himself up, limps to the door.
He grabs the
handle, PUSHES IT OPEN...
58
SEWING ROOM, IDA'S CABIN - DAY

Mike enters to find a sewing machine, some yarn, an antique
radio, but more importantly, No Sheryl. He steps over to the
radio, when he notices...

OCTOBER 17, 2006
51.
AN INCH THICK LAYER OF DUST COVERS THE RADIO. He swipes it
with his finger. This thing hasn't been used in years.
Mike turns, steps on a throw-rug laying in the center of the
floor... HIS FOOT SINKS a little. Mike tests the floor board
again. It's RICKETY. He pulls the rug out...
REVEAL: A TRAP DOOR.
Mike grabs the latch, lifts it open.

FROM BELOW... Looking up past a weathered, worn and wooden
staircase up at Mike.
Carefully, Mike makes his way down the steps, into...

CHAPEL - CABIN BASEMENT - DAY
60
Religious artifacts, lots of them. Crosses, photos of Jesus,
statues of Mary, etc. Don the walls, shelves... everywhere.
On the far side of the room... like an altar shrine...
NINE
LARGE GLASS JARS FILLED WITH LIQUID...
INSIDE EACH JAR - HUMAN FETUSES, all in various stages of
development and DEFORMITY. Each jar is labelled with their
own individual bronze nameplate (#1, MATTHEW... #2, JOHN...
#3, PETER... #4, LUKE, etc...).
THE LAST JAR - The fetus is closest to term, maybe 8 months
along). The nameplate reads, "TIMOTHY."
Mike, completely freaked out, backpedals, bumps into AN IRON
DOOR. He turns the handle, opens it...
61
HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT
61
It's pitch black as Mike opens the door.
Next to the door, a
light switch... He flips it ON.
Sounding like small gunshots, a series of overhead lights
TURN ON illuminating a long, narrow, curved hallway. At the
far end... THREE DOORS. (RECOGNIZE THIS FROM THE OPENING
SCENE.) A sound. It's distant, muffled...indistinguishable.
Mike stirs, hearing the faint, muted sound from the end of
the hallway.
Mike staggers, leans against the wall for support. He's
woozy, but determined. He proceeds down the hall, towards
the doors.
Just as Mike passes underneath a light... POP! THE LIGHTS
EXPLODES. SPARKS, GLASS SHOWER onto Mike. As he brushes
himself off.
52.
A SCREAM cries out.
MIKE
Sheryl!?
Mike moves faster, reaches the end of the hallway, faces the
door. He turns the knob, pushes it open, and...
62
TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT
62
Mike steps into the room, the light from the hall SPILLS INTO
THE ROOM, falls across...
Sheryl, tied to a beam that extends from the ceiling to the
floor, a coarse rope secures a gag in her mouth. She's
bruised with a lot of nicks and scratches.
Sheryl and Mike's eyes lock.
Euphoria, pain all at once.
MIKE
Oh my God.
Mike runs to her, touches her face.
He checks the ropes
tying Sheryl. They're very secure.
MIKE
I need something to cut you down,
baby.
Sheryl tries to motion to the other side of the room.
Mike follows her gaze... Searching wildly...
scanning the
room... a tool bench... tools... TOOLS!
ON A TOOL BENCH - A litany of the conventional and
unconventional. A hammer, screw drivers, axes, a FLASHLIGHT,
then, finally... in the middle of bunch... A HUNTER'S KNIFE.
Mike grabs the knife, hobbles back to Sheryl.
He slides the
blade between her cheek and the rope, SLICES.
Several tense
moments later... the rope breaks.
Mike tosses the rope and gag away.
They kiss.
MIKE
Are you okay?
SHERYL
Get me out of here.
Hurry.
Mike starts cutting the ropes around her wrists.
SHERYL
He'll be back soon.
53.
MIKE
Who's he?
OFF SCREEN: A LOUD THUD resounds.
Where did it come from?
Not wanting or waiting to find out, Mike doubles the effort.
SHERYL
Come on, come on, come on...
SNAP!
Finally, the ropes tear.
Sheryl's free.
Just as...
ALL THE LIGHTS SIMULTANEOUSLY GO OUT. COMPLETE AND TOTAL
DARKNESS SURROUND THE YOUNG COUPLE. Sheryl lets rip a short,
but loud SCREAM. Mike quickly silences her.
BREATHING INTENSIFIES.
Mike and Sheryl take refuge in each
other's arms. Then...
Mike remembers... on the tool bench... THE FLASHLIGHT.
He
feels around for the bench, when... WHACK.
MIKE
Fuck!
He banged his injured leg on something.
SHERYL
(Whispers)
What are you doing?
Mike reaches the tool bench, feels around.
Finds it.
SHERYL
(Whispers)
Mike? Mike?
Mike TURNS ON THE FLASHLIGHT.
The beam CUTS through the
darkness and onto...
The Concealed Figure, stands face to face with Mike
brandishing his axe/sickle.
SHERYL SCREAMS!
The Concealed Figure swings the axe/sickle, slices Mike
across the forearm. BLOOD SPRAYS ACROSS THE FLOOR.
Mike YELPS in pain, drops the flashlight and knife.
MIKE
Sheryl, run!
But Sheryl freezes.

He comes at Mike again, but... he eludes the attack.
Mike grabs the flashlight, the only weapon within his reach,
and SWINGS, STRIKING THE CONCEALED FIGURE IN THE KNEE, he
drops to the ground.
The Concealed Figure grabs Mike by the throat, runs him as
hard and fast as he can against a wall!
Sheryl's frozen in fear.
He SQUEEZES his throat harder, tighter.
Mike can't breathe.
Mike smacks the Concealed Figure in the face, squirms, all to
no avail, until...
Mike JAMS his THUMB INTO HIS EYE.
He SCREAMS, DROPS Mike.
They both fall to the floor.
The fallen flashlight's beam illuminates Sheryl backed in the
corner.
MIKE
(To Sheryl)
Get the fuck out of here!
Now!
Finally Sheryl runs out of the room...

As the Concealed Figure writhes in pain...
Mike catches his breath, attempts to stand, only... his body
buckles under the pain.
He throws a look to the Figure, then crawls over to the tool
bench. He pulls himself up using the bench for support. He
haphazardly feels for a weapon... any weapon.
He grabs a hammer, turns and...
The Figure grabs Mike's wrist, then HEAD-BUTTS MIKE between
the eyes. He falls to the floor. Out cold.
The Concealed Figure holds his injured eye with one hand,
grabs the SICKLE/AXE with the other.

HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT

Sheryl reaches the iron door, but stops.
Looks back into the
darkness.
SHERYL
Mike?
(No response)
Mike?
Still no answer. Then... Sheryl spots the light switch,
FLIPS IT... THE LIGHTS SNAP ON!
Suddenly, THE CONCEALED FIGURE APPEARS OUT OF THE DARKNESS!
SHERYL SCREAMS!
HE LUNGES FOR SHERYL, but misses.
She runs through the door,
into...
66
CHAPEL - IDA'S CABIN - DAY
66
... Sheryl rushes into the room, but trips on something.
When she gets up, the first thing she sees... THE FETUS JARS!
She coughs violently, almost pukes.
She stumbles, hurries up
the trap door steps...
A moment later...
The Concealed Figure pops through the iron door.
For the
first time we see the Concealed Figure wholly...
THIS IS DEACON. Half his body scarred, burned. He stands
well over six feet tall, muscles rippling everywhere. A
frightful sight.
He peers up the trap door steps, pursues Sheryl...

TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY
70
SHERYL'S POV - OUT OF FOCUS, WOBBLY. LIGHTS, a rainbow of
FUZZY COLORS DANCE BEFORE US. Slowly, bring into focus...
Sheryl coughs, gags on something.
SHERYL'S POV - She lifts her arms to discover her wrists are
tied together tightly.
SHERYL'S POV - Ida enters the room carrying something.
Sheryl's breath quickens. Ida walks right up to Sheryl.
She
places a FLOWER WREATH in her hair, adjusts it to fit.
58.
IDA
Perfect. Just perfect. You are
lovely as a summer's day.
(Checks her watch)
It's almost time.
Sheryl catches her REFLECTION in a small wall mirror.
71
CHAPEL - DAY
71
ANGLE ON - A ROPE looped through a hook in the ceiling.
FOLLOW THE ROPE DOWN... PASS A PAIR OF BLOODY AND BRUISED
HANDS, WRISTS... keep going... end on Mike.
Mike's passed out. He dangles in the middle of the room. He
wears an old, moth-eaten sports jacket and slacks. A rope
gags his mouth.
ANGLE ON - the SICKLE/AXE.
As it moves towards Mike...
Deacon, a black ring surrounds his injured eye, steps in
front of Mike, holds the blade CENTIMETERS from Mike's eye.
An eye for an eye?
Mike wakes and... immediately freaks out. He tries to shake
loose, but can't. Deacon stares at him, but...
CLYDE (O.S.)
Deacon!
Clyde enters. He wears a long garment around his neck,
carries a bible.
CLYDE
That's enough. Get him ready.
Deacon backs off. He undoes a slipknot on the far wall,
which causes Mike to come CRASHING to the floor. Deacon
lifts Mike to his feet, positions him.
It's only now Mike gets a gander at the room.
The FETUS JARS adorn the far wall. There's a giant WOODEN
CROSS hanging over a makeshift altar. CANDLES anywhere and
everywhere.
An old phonograph, one that you CRANK to play, rests in the
corner. Clyde places the needle down on a record, CRANKS THE
WHEEL. The MUSIC kicks in, CLASSICAL RELIGIOUS... It's
hollow, full of static and futz.
Mike watches... HIS EYES OPEN WIDE, as...
59.
The iron door slowly CREAKS open.
ANGLE ON - A FILTHY PAIR OF WHITE DRESS SHOES. Ropes secure
the ankles so movement's limited to inches at a time.
Shimmying into the room, wearing a dusty, old wedding dress
and a flower wreath in her hair is Sheryl. Her wrists still
bound. Her mouth gagged.
Mike and Sheryl take each other in. Tears spring to Sheryl's
eyes. She takes another jerky step closer.
Ida is visible behind her, guides her towards Mike. She
positions her next to him so that both face the altar.
Clyde glances to Ida who silences the music.
CLYDE
And Jesus answered and said unto them,
"Each man should have his own wife,
and each woman her own husband. The
husband should fulfill his marital
duty to his wife, and likewise the
wife to her husband."
IDA
Amen.
CLYDE
And so, in the presence of our Lord
Jesus Christ, I ask you Michael... and
you Sheryl, do you accept the sacred
covenant of marriage?
Mike and Sheryl stare at Clyde.
Neither flinch.
Clyde glances to Deacon, who immediately steps forward,
touches the sickle blade to Sheryl's throat.
CLYDE
I'll ask again... Do you accept this
covenant of marriage?
Sheryl nods immediately.
Mike nods too.
Clyde signals for Deacon to step back.
He obeys.
CLYDE
Then by the power vested in me, I
pronounce you man and wife.
Clyde signals to Ida.
60.
Ida removes Sheryl's graduation ring from her finger. She
then slides TWO TARNISHED GOLD BANDS, one on Sheryl's finger,
the other on Mike's.
Clyde unties the rope securing Mike's gag in his mouth,
removes it.
MIKE
Why are you doing this? We did
nothing to you people. Let us go!
CLYDE
You may kiss the bride.
MIKE
You fucking people are fucking sick!
Clyde's temper flares...
CLYDE
(Stern and cold)
Do not use that type of language in
this house again. Now... kiss the
bride or...
(Gestures to Deacon)
... he'll cut off your lips.
Mike stares in horror at Clyde, turns to Sheryl.
MIKE
I love you.
Mike kisses her briefly on the cheek.
Clyde smiles satisfied, nods to Deacon. He immediately lifts
Sheryl up and throws her over his shoulder.
MIKE
What are you doing?
Deacon carries her from the room.
Sheryl CRIES.
MIKE
LET HER GO! SHERYL!
(To Clyde)
Let her go!...Please, let her go!
Clyde pulls the ropes, hoists Mike back into a dangling
position. He secures the knot before exiting the room.
MIKE
SHERYL!
(To Ida)
(MORE)
61.
MIKE (cont'd)
Please. Don't hurt her. Whatever it
is you want, I'll give it to you.
IDA
I know you will.
She stuffs the gag in, secures it in place with the rope.
She ties the knot. Perfect.
Ida exits the room.
Mike is alone.
Mike tries to yank his hands through the knot. His wrists
and hands turn red, his face is flushed...the knot is too
tight. He stops.
Mike takes a breath and tries again. His face and hands are
beet red. He pulls and pulls...but the rope doesn't budge.
Mike exhales. It's no use. He dangles there, helpless.
72
CHAPEL - NIGHT
72 A
Mike still dangles by his wrists.
Clyde enters.
Clyde unties the end of the rope on the floor.
The rope
UNFURLS, Mike DROPS to the ground.
Clyde picks him up, sits him in a nearby chair. Mike's
wrists, ankles and mouth still bound and gagged.
CLYDE
Gonna untie your mouth, now.
Have a
little "man to man" talk.
Clyde undoes the gag in Mike's mouth.
MIKE
Please... It's not too late.
Let us
go.
We won't tell anyone.
CLYDE
(Beat)
How well do you know your bible,
Michael?
MIKE
Jesus Fucking Christ...
Clyde SLAPS Mike across the face.
62.
CLYDE
I told you before to watch that mouth,
mister.
MIKE
Fuck you.
Clyde PUNCHES him, not once, but twice.
He readies a third.
CLYDE
You through?
Mike spits some blood on the floor.
Nods.
CLYDE
I'll ask again... how well do you know
the bible?
MIKE
Not very.
CLYDE
That's okay. It's fine. That's why I
am here... teach you the way things
are and the way they should be.
73
TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT
73
Sheryl sits in a chair in the middle of the room. Still
gagged. She wears a new outfit. A handmade dress with a
small crest embroidered over the heart. IT'S SIMILAR TO THE
ONE WORN BY SARAH (GIRL FROM THE OPENING SCENE OF FILM).
Ida pulls tight the rope securing her wrists to the arms of
the chair. Satisfied.
IDA
I'll be right back.
Ida exits the room. Deacon stands by the door.
He and
Sheryl alone together.
Sheryl tries not to make eye contact.
Deacon stares at her.
Longingly.
DEACON'S POV - On Sheryl's chest, expanding and contracting
with every breath.
ON DEACON - SLOWLY PUSH INTO TIGHT CLOSE UP
DEACON'S POV - Sheryl, a heavenly glow encircles her (and her
gag mysteriously gone), turns to Deacon. A look of calm and
lust in her eyes.
63.
SHERYL
I want you, Deacon.
(Jump Cut to...)
I want you to fuck me.
Hard.
ON DEACON - His stare deepens.
Sheryl, the heavenly glow gone, her gag back in place.
Watches Deacon. She squirms, cries.
74
CHAPEL - NIGHT
74
Clyde sits in a chair next to Mike.
CLYDE
Lord knows the will of a man gets
tested. Cruelly most times. But the
righteous persevere. They do what
needs to be done, even though they
don't want to. It's what makes a man,
a man. Let me tell you the story of
Judas, he was one of Jesus's apostles.
Judas led Roman Soldiers to the
capture and eventual death of our Lord
Jesus Christ. And now, is supposedly
seated next to Satan, his soul burning
in hell forever for this sin. But I
don't believe that's the case. I have
my own theory. The death of Jesus was
predicted thousands of years before
Judas ever came along. And for the
prophecy to be fulfilled, Jesus had to
die. If he didn't, the gates of
heaven couldn't be opened for mankind.
I don't think, for an instant, Judas
wanted to be the one, but... someone
had to. Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus
could die for our sins. Save us all.
And I believe at this moment... Judas
is in heaven, despite his sin, because
it led to the greater good.
(Beat)
Relations prior to marriage is a sin.
You and Sheryl are sinners in the
Lord's eyes. And because of those
sins, your souls are damned. But Ida
and Me, we're gonna give you a chance
to save your souls and do the right
thing, but... as previously stated,
you will need to persevere and show
the strength and will of your
character. But you'll do it. Because
that's what needs to be done.
64.
Mike stares unflinching at Clyde.
75
TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT
75
Deacon kneels before Sheryl who tries to move, but can't.
ANGLE ON - Deacon lays his scarred hand on Sheryl's thigh.
Sheryl squirms, but that's all she can do.
Then...
IDA (O.S.)
Deacon!
Deacon jumps up, backs off.
IDA
You get away from her.
Git!
Now!
Ida sets a tray she was carrying down, chases Deacon from the
room. She shuts the door behind him.
IDA
I'm sorry about that, Sugar.
My
brother, he's not well.
She retrieves the tray, brings it over closer to Sheryl.
IDA
It's not all his fault. Our father
wasn't very Christian and then there
was the accident. Along with the
scarring, lost use of his vocals.
Can't speak a lick. Now, I've spoken
to him. What happened with the others
won't happen to you. He's promised me
that.
What others?
What did he do?
IDA
I'm gonna take that out of your mouth
now. I brought you some tea, got some
primrose in it. Help you relax, get
some rest. Okay?
Ida unties the gag in Sheryl's mouth. She coughs a few
times. Ida raises the mug of tea to her lips...
SHERYL
Please don't do this. Please let me
go. Please..I just want to go home.

IDA
(Cold)
Drink the tea.
Ida brings the mug to her lips again, pours some in Sheryl's
mouth. She swallows a big gulp.
IDA
That's better. Good girl.
(Changing topics)
I almost forgot to ask... How does it
feel being married?
SHERYL
Why are you doing this?
IDA
I thought you'd be happy about that.
All I ever wanted out of life was two
things... to be married and to have a
baby. The Lord blessed me with Clyde
and I thank Him every day for that.
Ida pours some more tea into Sheryl.
IDA
But having a baby's been...
complicated.
76
CHAPEL - NIGHT
76
Clyde walks over to the fetus jars.
Stares at them.
A
sadness in his eyes.
CLYDE
She can conceive fine... just...
can't seem to make it all the way
through. Timothy was the toughest...
Made it to month eight.
ANGLE ON - The "Timothy" Fetus jar.
The most developed of
them all.
CLYDE
City Doctor had some fancy mumbo-jumbo
words for the condition.
(Beat; turns to Mike)
Breaks my heart every time. That
woman was born to be a mother. It's
her calling in life. Just like you
and Sheryl have a calling.
MIKE
What exactly do you want from us?
66.
The IRON DOOR FLIES OPEN, Deacon emerges, stands over Mike.

TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT

Sheryl sways back and forth.
Her EYELIDS heavy.
The
primrose "kicking in."
Ida places her hand on Sheryl's cheek.
IDA
You're young, strong... It's gonna be
easy for you. Not like me.
SHERYL
(Barely conscious)
Wh-what...?
IDA
You're gonna have a baby, Sheryl.

My baby.

The door to the room FLIES OPEN.
Deacon drags Mike inside,
Clyde right behind them.
To Mike's horror...
MIKE
Oh my God...
Sheryl lies unconscious on top of the table, Ida by her side.
ANGLE ON SHERYL - Each of her limbs tied down with heavy
rope. Her legs are spread apart.
MIKE
What have you done to her?
IDA
She'll be out for hours, but she's
fine.
CLYDE
Ida'll come back in a little bit,
check to see that the deed has been
done. If it hasn't...the next time
you see your little lady...a piece of
her will be missing.

Don't test us on that one.
IDA
Now, we know conception's not
automatic. So don't feel like all the
pressure's on right now. We're
prepared to do this however long it
takes. You give us the effort each
time, eventually the magic will
happen.
MIKE
You're out of your fucking minds.
Clyde grabs Mike's wrist, turns over his palm.
Clyde takes a
knife from his belt, SLICES MIKE'S PALM.
MIKE SCREAMS.
BLOOD POURS FROM THE WOUND.
CLYDE
What did I tell you about the
language?
Ida grabs a fresh rag, wraps Mike's hand in it.
CLYDE
Deacon will be right outside that
door. The only door. This room has
no windows and is buried twenty feet
below ground. Cutting to the chase...
there's no way out and you can scream
yourself hoarse, no one will hear you.
IDA
We'll let you have your privacy now.
(Remembers)
Oh, almost forgot.
Ida goes to the corner where the phonograph sits.
She cranks
the handle, places the needle on the record.
The record crackles, Pachelbel's "Canon" fills the room.
Deacon, Clyde and Ida exit.
They SHUT and LOCK the door
behind them.

Promise me, Clyde.
CLYDE
I promise.
Clyde wraps his arm around Ida's shoulder, comforting her.

TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT
81
Mike makes his way to the table, to Sheryl.
He pulls himself
to his feet.
He takes Sheryl in. She looks peaceful. He runs his good
hand through her hair. Tears roll down his cheeks.
Mike checks each of Sheryl's ropes.
They are all tightly
secured.
Mike haphazardly checks every nook and cranny of the room.
But Clyde was right. No way out.
Mike stares at the phonograph...
HE KICKS IT OFF THE TABLE,
KICKS AND BASHES IT TO PIECES.
VFX: Mike's breathing INTENSIFIES. PUSH INTO TIGHT CLOSE
UP... His world is not caving in, it's already caved.

Sheryl's head falls to the side, bumps the table.
She wakes.

holding hers.
The door UNBOLTS, FLIES open.
Mike comes to and glances up as Deacon storms into the room,
drags him out screaming.

Mike, without his shirt, hangs by his wrists from iron
shackles secured to the ceiling. (He's hooked up the same
way the Young Man was in the opening scene of the story.)
Deacon secures the last of the restraints.
Clyde enters,
walks straight up to Mike...
CLYDE
Was I at all unclear yesterday?
MIKE
No, but...
CLYDE
Did you understand what was expected
of you?
MIKE
Yes, but... How do you expect...
CLYDE
Clearly you did not understand. You
did not even attempt relations last
evening.
MIKE
What you're asking to do is sick.
You're sick.
CLYDE
You didn't have a problem when
penetration was a sin, but when it's
your wife, it's sick?!? Unbelievable.
Clyde glares angrily at Mike, then heads to the door.
CLYDE
You knew the rules, Michael. I warned
you. Now, Deacon, here, will remind
you.
Mike turns to Deacon, who stands over the tool bench.
DOZENS
of sharp instruments of torture lay before him.
Clyde shuts the door on Mike.

TORTURE ROOM #2 - DAY
87
Deacon stands by the TOOL BENCH, his back to Mike. Deacon
grabs several different SCARY INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE, tests
them out.
Mike tries to see what he's doing. HORRIBLE SOUNDS, METAL
STRIKING METAL, BLADES SHARPENING, ETC.
Deacon finally selects a weapon, turns around...
Mike stares at Deacon who holds a CAT-O'-NINE TAILS in his
hand. Deacon walks behind Mike...
MIKE
You don't have to do this.
Come on.
Deacon pulls his arm back, WHIPS MIKE ACROSS THE BACK.
MIKE SCREAMS IN AGONY.
88
TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY
88
Sheryl hears MIKE'S SCREAMS, but she's in a predicament of
her own.
Sheryl's tied to chair. Her hand is secured to table top.
She can't move it. Fingers separated.
SHERYL
What are they doing to him?
IDA
You should concern yourself with
what's about to happen to you.
Ida opens a SEWING BOX, but instead of needles and yarn, she
removes a CLEAVER.
71.
Sheryl looks at the cleaver, then... to her hand... the pinky
finger separated and immobile.
SHERYL
What are you doing, Ida?
IDA
You think you're so much smarter than
me, don't you?
SHERYL
No.
IDA
Yes you do. Admit it'cause I can see
it in your eyes, darling. With your
fancy schools and job and such.
(Realizes)
You think you are better than me.
SHERYL
No, I don't.
Yes she does.
IDA
(Beat)
Might surprise you, but I was quite
the student back in the day. Straight
A's. Every subject'cept for Science.
Infuriated me how they tried to
explain away the Lord's creations.
Our teacher, Mr. Billings, once
said... in the future, humans won't be
born with a pinky finger'cause of
evolution.
(Frustration building)
Of all the... I shouted, "No! We are
created in the Lord's image... not
some nonsensical theory by Darwind."
Sheryl stares at Ida, terrified would be an understatement.
IDA
I suppose Mr. Billings and Mr. Darwind
can stand up and cheer, because you,
little lady... you're about to
evolve.

Mike dangles...
HIS BACK CUT, BRUISED AND BLOODY.

Please.
No more.
Deacon faces Mike, looks him square in the eyes. He walks
back to the tool bench, lays the whipping device down.
Mike breathes a touch easier, until...
Deacon reappears, A JAR OF MOONSHINE in his hands. He dips
one of his scarred fingers into the liquid and GENTLY touches
a wound on Mike's body.
The liquid stings.
Mike WINCES.
MIKE

IDA
You think I want to hurt a pretty
thing like you? Pains me, but...
until you and your husband obey, my
hands, much like yours, are tied.
SHERYL
I know about your condition, Ida.
It's not your fault. There are a lot
of women that can't carry a baby full
term. I know how much you're hurting.
Ida takes her attention from the finger, starts to pay
attention to Sheryl.
IDA
You don't know anything about me or
what I've gone through.
SHERYL
I'm here for you now.
I'll help you.

Sheryl on table, unconscious.
Her hand/finger bandaged.

NOTICE:
the back of Mike's shirt SOAKED in blood.
MIKE
How do you expect me to do this?
Like
this?
CLYDE
Do we need to provide you with some
more motivation?
IDA
You wouldn't want to put that lovely
bride of yours through a day like she
had today again, now would you?
MIKE
You'll never get away with this. We
have friends and family. They know
where we went. They'll come looking
for us. They'll find us!
CLYDE
That may very well be... but they
won't find your car.
Clyde dangles the keys - HIS KEYS - in front of Mike.
Deacon, Clyde and Ida leave.
THE DOOR BOLTS, LOCKS.
Mike limps over to Sheryl, he sees her bandaged hand.
MIKE
Oh baby, what did they do to you?
I'm
sorry. I'm so sorry.
SHERYL

audible)
Are they gone?
MIKE
(Surprised)
Yeah. You're awake?

SHERYL
Oh my God.
Mike...
MIKE
It's okay.
I'm okay.
SHERYL
You're not okay. We're not okay.
What are we gonna do?
MIKE
I don't know.
Sheryl takes a moment. Thinks carefully about how exactly to
phrase this... Then...
SHERYL
Maybe... we should just give them
what they want?
MIKE
What?
SHERYL
If it stops them from hurting you and
me... maybe we should...
MIKE
Absolutely not. No fucking way.
Forget the fact, that the moment you
get pregnant, they'll kill me. Then
the moment you give birth, you're
dead. Beyond both of those reasons...
ain't no fucking way I am going to
give them our child.
Tears POUR from Sheryl.
MIKE
For all my coward marriage moments...
I've thought about our child. Is that
stupid? I picture what he'll be
like...
SHERYL
He?

MIKE
Wishful thinking. I picture your
heart... your eyes... And I picture
us, raising him. Growing old with
him.

No. Ain't no fucking way I'm going to

EVELYN
Good morning, Sam.

Sam grabs some papers from his mailbox.
Evelyn's used to
Sam's moods.
EVELYN
Hey, Sam, do you remember a Virginia

Friday?
SAM
Friday? Well...There was one couple,
but they didn't say where they were

EVELYN
Gal's mother's called three times this

SAM
She sure this was the park they were

EVELYN
Yup. Woman's already offering up a

Damn it. Have her fax some photos up

Clyde and Ida are pissed.
79.
CLYDE
We do appreciate your honesty,
Michael. And believe me, we
understand your extreme situation,
but... Punishment's going to have to
be handed down.
Suddenly, Clyde's walkie-talkie goes off.
SAM (V.O.)
Clyde, it's Sam at base, come back.
CLYDE
Go for, Clyde.
Mike screams trying to be heard while Clyde has button
pushed.
CLYDE
(To Deacon and Ida)
Restrain him.
Deacon holds Mike, while Ida grabs the gag.
SAM (V.O.)
Yeah, morning, Clyde. Got a missing
person's report. Young Couple out of
Alexandria. We're printing up some
flyers with their photos right now.
MIKE
I told you. I told they'd be coming.
Ida shoves the gag into his mouth, ties it secure.
SAM (V.O.)
When you get a chance, grab some and
let's start circulating, huh?
Clyde throws a concerned look to Ida.
SAM (V.O.)
Clyde?
CLYDE
Copy that.
Clyde thinks a beat, then...
CLYDE
(To Deacon)
Get him in the other room.
Now.
Concern covers Clyde's face...

TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY
102
Sheryl sits alone, tied, gagged and confined to a chair on
the far end of the room.
CLOSE ON - Behind Sheryl's back. Her bloody hands, sans one
finger, tremble softly. Her remaining digits start to LOOSEN
her restraints.
103
TORTURE ROOM #2 - DAY
103
Mike hangs, once again. Clyde stands before him, Ida enters.
She wheels the bar-b-q in the room.
IN THE PIT - It's filled with hot, smoking coals. Also,
THREE IRON BRANDS rest buried in the coals. All glow a FIERY
ORANGE.
CLYDE
I think we have to have another... man
to man discussion, here, Michael.
But unlike previous moments, Mike is not begging or pleading.
He holds a calm demeanor.
CLYDE
Seems as though, time is now factoring
into our situation.
104
TORTURE ROOM #1
104
Sheryl continues working the ropes, as... THE DOOR CREAKS
OPEN. Sheryl freezes, stops working the ropes.
Deacon enters, sickle in hand. He's calm and determined.
He
stares at Sheryl. Sinister thoughts in mind.
83.
QUICK CUTS DEACON'S POV: Sheryl's mouth/ chest/ legs.
Deacon approaches Sheryl, kneels down in front of her. He
LAYS THE SICKLE ON THE FLOOR. Sheryl eyes the weapon.
Deacon takes something from his pocket, lifts his arms up
towards Sheryl's head.
She winces, expecting the worst.
Deacon slides Sheryl's locket around her neck.
The chain
repaired. Deacon beams with pride.
Deacon shifts her skirt exposing more skin and places his
hands on Sheryl's bare thighs. She twitches instinctively
causing Deacon to squeeze her thighs TIGHTER.
Sheryl winces in pain, stops her struggle. Locks EYES with
Deacon. Suddenly, an aura of CALM falls over her.
BEHIND SHERYL'S BACK... She resumes untying the knots.
Deacon savors every moment of Sheryl. Her smell, form. He
glides his hands up her body, past her stomach and onto her
breasts. He GROPES them, in his own heaven.
CLOSE ON - The knot loosens... almost there.
105
TORTURE ROOM #2 - DAY
105
Ida ROTATES the brands in the bar-b-q, doing her best subtle
intimidation.
CLYDE
We're not violent people, Michael.
It
pains us to pain you.
MIKE
I don't know... Seems as though
Deacon and yourselves get a real kick
out of it.
CLYDE
Now see, this is what I am talking
about. It's your attitude. It's the
disobedience, the cussing...Sooner we
get what we want, then no further harm
has to fall upon you and your wife.
MIKE
Way I see it, you need us alive. You
need us, period. And now that Park
Services and State Police are looking
for us, you're starting to panic,
(MORE)
84.
MIKE (cont'd)
knowing your whole plan's crumbling
down before your eyes.
(To Ida STRONG)
So you can stop spinning those fucking
irons thinking you're scaring me,
cause you're not.
(Beat; to both of them)
You're a couple of demented, sick,
pathetic freaks.
Ida grabs a brand, JABS IT ONTO MIKE'S CHEST.
MIKE SCREAMS. THE BRAND BURNS INTO HIS FLESH.
HIS EYES
BULGE. HE VOMITS.
106
TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN
106
Deacon TEARS open Sheryl's blouse, exposing her bra and more
cleavage. He slides his hands over her breasts... he's in
heaven. Sheryl doesn't resist because...
CLOSE ON - The knot's undone.
Her hands are free.
Deacon looks into Sheryl's eyes.
He senses something
different. Does he know?
Deacon pulls himself closer to Sheryl. Their faces only
inches apart. He PULLS her gag out of her mouth, lets it
dangle around her neck. Sheryl swallows nervously. Resists
the urge to scream. She's frozen. Then... Deacon leans
in... KISSES SHERYL.
Knowing it's now or never, Sheryl KNEES DEACON IN THE BALLS.
He falls over in agony.
Deacon looks up at her, when... SMACK! She KICKS him right
in the face. Sheryl springs from the chair, grabs the
sickle, turns and...
CRACK! Deacon, already back on his feet, PUNCHES Sheryl hard
across the jaw. She hits the wall, then falls to the floor,
drops the sickle.
ANGLE ON - A SMALL POCKET KNIFE falls off a shelf in the room
onto the floor.
Deacon grabs the sickle, then lifts her up BY HER HAIR and
drags her across the room.
He throws her face/stomach down on the table top, flips her
dress up onto her back. He slides the sickle between her ass
and underwear and... CUTS HER PANTIES OFF IN ONE QUICK
MOTION, SPREADS HER LEGS APART.
SHOOTING SCRIPT
OCTOBER 17, 2006
85.
Sheryl, still stunned from the punch, only now starts to
realize what is happening to her.
SHERYL
(Weak, soft)
No.
She tries to wiggle off table or close her legs, but Deacon's
too strong. He grabs the back of her head, SLAMS it against
the table, pinning it in place. With the other hand, HE
SLIDES OFF HIS PANTS.
SHERYL
(Stronger)
No!
107
TORTURE ROOM #2 - IDA'S CABIN
107
Mike, his chest scarred, bloody, from the fresh wound,
dangles helplessly. Vomit splashed down his body.
Clyde and Ida look to one another...
CLYDE
What was that?
108
TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY
108
Deacon slaps his left hand over her mouth, climbs on top of
Sheryl using his weight to keep her in place. Deacon
positions himself for penetration, when...
Sheryl SCREAMS, but Deacon's hand muffles the cries.
With every ounce of strength left inside her, SHERYL BITES
DOWN ON DEACON'S HAND. He SCREAMS, falling off of her.
CLOSE ON DEACON'S HAND - blood oozes, a large piece looks
ripped out.
Sheryl SPITS the small chunk of his hand out of her mouth.
Deacon grabs the SICKLE/AXE, starts towards Sheryl...
At the top of her lungs, SHERYL LETS LOOSE A BLOOD CURDLING
SCREAM! And...
Ida bursts in the room...
IDA
Deacon!
Stop right there!
Deacon turns to Ida, stops his attack on Sheryl.
86.
IDA
Out!
Get out!
Deacon slinks away. Sheryl curls up in a ball, emotions
consume her. She breaks down.
109
TORTURE ROOM #1
110
Sheryl's tied, once again, to the table. Mike tied to a
chair, which is dragged into the room by Clyde.
Sheryl sees Mike's burned chest.
CLYDE
This is getting out of hand, y'all.
Nobody wanted what just almost
happened to Sheryl to happen. But,
you keep dragging this thing out...
things are gonna... happen.
IDA
I sent Deacon away for a bit. He
knows he done wrong. You say right
now that you are ready to perform your
marital duties, then I'll keep him
away.
MIKE
Have you ever thought that God doesn't
want you to have a child? That's why
he fucking kills them before they're
born. Because you're fucking insane
monsters that don't deserve a child.
Ida SLAPS Mike.
IDA
You take that back!
MIKE
No.
IDA
Take it back.
Ida digs her hand into Mike's bear trap wound, squeezes.
But
Mike doesn't scream or squirm. He endures the pain.
87.
MIKE
Go ahead and torture me. There's
absolutely no way I would ever give a
child of mine to you.
IDA
How very brave. Fine. I won't
torture you.
(Looks to Sheryl)
I'll torture her. I can bring back
Deacon. Let him have her. Plenty of
other holes he can go into where a
baby can't be made.
Ida grabs a nearby knife, walks up to Sheryl.
IDA
Or maybe we can just start dicing.
All we need is a healthy heart, brain
and uterus. She don't need the rest
of her fingers, or toes... or her
nose, ears. I could carve out her eye
right now.
Ida places the knife on top of Sheryl's cheek, just below the
eye. The tip just centimeters away from the eyeball.
MIKE
No!
Ida takes the knife away, gets in Mike's face...
IDA
Then you will give me my baby. My
child, born in wedlock, saved from its
sinner parents and raised to fear God
and give him praise.
Sheryl starts LAUGHING. Inappropriate, but nonetheless,
She's cracking up. Has she finally cracked?
SHERYL
That's why you married us? So we
could conceive our child in wedlock?
The fucking joke's on you... I'm
already pregnant. Eight weeks
yesterday.
Clyde and Ida stare disbelievingly at Sheryl.
IDA
You're lying.
Mike stares in shock at Sheryl.
88.
In that look, Ida knows Sheryl's telling the truth.
SHERYL
I was trying to find the right time to
tell you.
TEARS fill both their eyes.
IDA
No, no, no, no!
This can't be.
NO!
Clyde grabs hold of Ida, tries to calm her down.
When...
OFF SCREEN: A GLASS BREAKS.
It came from upstairs.
IDA AND CLYDE SPRING INTO ACTION.
They exit the room, BOLT
THE DOOR LOCKED.

Sheryl lies on the table, out cold.
Clyde levels the shotgun to Mike's head.
But something odd
catches Clyde's attention...
ON THE FLOOR - Behind Mike's chair, some rope shavings,
pieces.
CLYDE
What the...?
Mike SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABS CLYDE PULLS HIM IN.
As Clyde falls into Mike's body.
The SHOTGUN FIRES
HARMLESSLY INTO THE GROUND.
Mike swings his hand around, PLUNGES the pocket knife into
Clyde's neck!
Clyde SCREAMS. The knife embedded in his neck.
He throws
his hands to it, stumbles backwards and falls.
Clyde tries to speak, but it comes out GURGLING and BLOODY.
MIKE
Believe me, I understand your extreme
situation, but... Punishment's going
to have to be handed down.

No more ammo.
Mike glances around the room, then spies... THE KNIFE he
stabbed CLYDE with. He picks it up off the floor.

life is gone. Before she know what's happening, she turns...
MIKE, knife in hand, EXPLODES FROM TORTURE ROOM #2, RUNS
STRAIGHT FOR IDA, but...
Ida SWINGS THE SHOVEL, KNOCKS MIKE'S LEGS OUT FROM UNDER HIM.
He trips and falls to the floor.
Ida gets up, STOMPS DOWN ON MIKE'S HAND.
The knife drops.
FROM THE HALLWAY... Sheryl looks out, watches as...
BACK IN THE ROOM...
Ida grabs the knife, PLUNGES it deep
into Mike's calf.
IDA
In for a penny, in for a pound. I
can't save your soul now, Michael. I
tried. I gave you a way to cleanse
yourself of all your sins and deliver
you to heaven... and how do you repay
me?
Ida takes the knife, DAGGERS IT INTO MIKE'S THIGH.
IDA
BY KILLING MY CLYDE?!?
SHERYL--
Spots the shovel on the floor, grabs it...
IDA
There is no soul blacker than yours.
And now, by the grace of God, I must
deliver you to Satan myself.
Ida retracts the blade, pulls herself on top of Mike.
Ready
to stab again, when...
SHERYL SLAMS THE SHOVEL OVER IDA'S HEAD.

Ida falls over.

CRIPPLES HIM. Mike falls back to the ground.

I can't make it.
SHERYL

MIKE

Clyde's walkie-talkie. It's probably
upstairs. Find it. Call the Ranger
base.
(Remembers)
My gun. See if you can find our
stuff. My gun's in my backpack, side
pocket.
SHERYL
What good's the gun?
You tossed away
the bullets.
Mike turns away.
Guilt etched on his face.
MIKE
There's another box of ammo.
SHERYL
Mike...!?!
MIKE
Let's get out of this alive first,
then you can bitch me out, okay?
Sheryl concedes.
She goes to the ladder, stops... turns.

Please, someone? Is anyone there that
can help?
SHERYL... Lowers the walkie, waits for an answer.
EVELYN... stops. She heard something, but not sure exactly
what. She re-enters, heads over to the CB. Just as she
picks up the CB Mic...
DEACON, dripping wet, appears in doorway, lunges for Sheryl.
Sheryl screams, drops walk-talkie, as Deacon tackles her onto
the bed. The WALKIE-TALKIE BREAKS into pieces.
EVELYN... Pushes the "talk button" on the CB...

Well, if you love me... Fight.

On a shelf are some towels, linens, etc.

Sheryl quickly rummages through her backpack. She finds...
her CELLPHONE. The fliers with the emergency contact info.

breath sounds, feels for his pulse, finds one. Very weak,
