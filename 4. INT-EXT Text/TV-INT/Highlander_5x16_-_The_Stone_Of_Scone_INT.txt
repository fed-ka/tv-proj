      SUPER: TUNNELS BENEATH WESTMINSTER ABBEY - 1720

      A dark netherworld of dripping water and slime.  In flickering
      TORCH-LIGHT we see two CLOAKED BRIGANDS squish their way
      through the tunnels, as we HEAR --

                                      MACLEOD
                          (quietly, muffled)
                    51, 52, 53, 54...

      CLOSER

      and we see URIAH: a thick lout, lugging a pick and shovel.
      Ahead of him, carrying the torch, we see the other is --

      MACLEOD

      carrying a crowbar, a length of rope coiled around his
      shoulder, he takes measured steps, counting carefully --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    57... 58... 59... sixty paces.

      He stops, jabs a triumphant finger at the wall.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    There.  Once we're in... we go
                    straight up.

                                      URIAH
                          (nervous)
                    I dunno.  If we ever gets caught --

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're paid well enough not to ask
                      questions.  Just dig.

      Uriah shrugs, drops his shovel and prepares to swing the
      pick.  But just as he winds up --

      MacLeod gets the BUZZ.  He lunges and grabs the pick handle,
      stopping Uriah in mid-swing.

                                      URIAH
                    What?


                                                                (CONTINUED)96515  "The Stone of Scone"    2.   Final Shooting Script 12/10/96

                                      MACLEOD
                    You just stay right here.
                          (grim)
                    I'll take care of whoever it is.

      He draws his sword.  Holding the torch in his free hand, he
      cautiously inches up the tunnel towards the BUZZ --

      Uriah waits nervously a moment -- then bolts!

      ON MACLEOD

      as he inches cautiously forward along the tunnel.

      MACLEOD S POV - THE TUNNEL AHEAD

      shadows from ANOTHER LANTERN flicker there.


      Where "dry land" meets the water system.  A SKIFF loaded
      with several STAVE BARRELS is moored with a thin rope.  on
      the barrels, the word GUNPOWDER.  Standing by the skiff --

      FITZCAIRN

      holds a lantern.  With him is his own brigand, PATRICK,
      shouldering a POWDER BARREL.

                                      PATRICK
                    'eere, Guv'ner... this stuff's bloody
                    'eavy.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    You're getting paid well enough aren't
                    you?

      Patrick shakes his head.

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                    Just quit whining and carry the
                      gunpowder.

      They begin to trudge down the tunnel, in the direction MacLeod
      is in.  As they PASS CAMERA we see --

      PATRICK'S BARREL

      leaks a long trail of GUNPOWDER behind him as he walks. 
      Neither man notices.  Then --

      CLOSE - FITZCAIRN

      as he gets the BUZZ.  He raises a hand for silence, and slowly
      draws his own sword.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96515  "The Stone of Scone"    3.   Final Shooting Script 12/10/96

1502CONTINUED:1502

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Stay here.  I'll take care of this.

      He starts edging along the tunnel.  Behind him, Patrick waits
      a BEAT -- then scoots back down the tunnel, laying the BARREL
      down near the boat as he does.  Then he turns and scrambles
      off into the dark, abandoning Fitzcairn.

      Fitzcairn continues on, a mirror image of MacLeod, making
      the same stealthy creep as he reaches the junction.  He takes
      a deep breath, grits his teeth...

      ON MACLEOD

      as he takes a breath, grits his teeth and leaps around the
      corner, sword already on the move

      ANGLE - MACLEOD AND FITZCAIRN

      as their swords clash at the same moment.  Then --

                                        FITZCAIRN/MACLEOD
                          (in unison)
                    You!

      They continue to parry, more in irritation than anger.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    What the devil are you doing here?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Stealing the Stone of Scone from
                      Westminster Abbey, to return it to
                    its rightful place in Scotland.
                          (then)
                    What the devil are you doing here?

      (DIALOGUE NOTE: Scone is pronounced as "skoon.")

                                      FITZCAIRN
                          (with pride)
                    I'm going to blow that pompous ass
                    George off the English throne and
                    bring the bloody abbey down around
                    his ears.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not before I've got the Stone, you're
                    not!

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    But if you steal the Stone, I'll
                    never get back in here!  They'll
                    close the place up so tight a mouse
                    won't be able to sneak in.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Fitzcairn, the Stone is what is most
                      important.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                          (pushing forward)
                    Says who?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (pushing back)
                    The people of Scotland.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    And what about the people of England?

                                      MACLEOD
                    To hell with the thieving bastards.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                          (flares)
                    That's it!  I'll take no more!

      The lantern is knocked from Fitzcairn's hand as he charges.

      ANGLE - TUNNEL FLOOR

      as the lantern EXPLODES and the powder ignites with a WHOOMPH
      and a FLASH.  The blazing trail of burning gunpowder races
      down the tunnel like a burning snake, heading straight to
      the SKIFF.

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                    Uh-oh.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What do you mean... "Uh-oh?"

      THE SKIFF

      suddenly FLARES with a WHOOMPH and starts BURNING.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    I mean... UH-OH!

      He turns and SPRINTS away down the tunnel -- and DIVES behind
      a pile of rubble.  A BEAT -- MacLeod follows.

      ON THE SKIFF

      as it EXPLODES in a huge fireball.

      MacLeod and Fitzcairn crouch down, smoking debris raining
      down on them.  As the smoke clears, they slowly stand and
      look at the smoking mess.

1502CONTINUED: (3)1502

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    This wouldn't have happened if you
                    hadn't been here!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Me?!  You're the one who brought the
                    bloody gunpowder...
                          (beat)
                    And you didn't even bring enough!

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    How would you know?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because the bloody Abbey's still
                    standing, you English nincompoop!

                                      FITZCAIRN
                      Nincompoop?!

      That does it.  Fitzcairn throws a haymaker at MacLeod, hits
      him.  MacLeod is taken by surprise, rubs his jaw.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Fine.

      He hauls back and SLUGS Fitzcairn.  Fitzcairn staggers, sees
      MacLeod with his fists up, ready to continue.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Wait!  Hold!  This is no way for
                    gentlemen to settle a dispute.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How do you suggest we settle it?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Man to man, like the warriors we
                    are...
                          (beat)
                    On the true field of battle.

      MacLeod stares a BEAT.  This is serious.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Very well.  What terms?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    If I lose, I'll help you steal your
                    precious Stone.  If you lose, you'll
                    help me bring the bloody place down
                    around their ears.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Done.

1502CONTINUED: (4)1502

      Suddenly A BULLET smashes into the wall over their heads. 
      We hear SHOTS -- Beefeaters are shooting down the tunnel at
      them.  MacLeod and Fitzcairn scramble in opposite directions.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    The battlefield at dawn!

      A SECOND BULLET SMASHES near MacLeod's head.

                                      MACLEOD
                    If we live that long.

      As he scuttles away into the darkness --

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      A dark, dirty ale house.  Two slatternly buxom WENCHES serve
      an array of the dregs of the Empire.

      At the entrance, MacLeod and Fitzcairn eye the place
      dubiously.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I should have kept my mouth shut.

      There's a SAILOR near the entrance, slumped face down over a
      table.  Fitzcairn shakes his head at the sight.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Look at that.  Dead drunk.

1507CONTINUED:1507

      MacLeod lifts the man's head by his collar, revealing a pair
      of sightless eyes.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.  Just dead.

      He releases the head, which THUNKS onto the table.  MacLeod
      squints into the murky room.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    You're sure your man knows how to
                    get into the Tower?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    I should hope so.  He works there.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    As what?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    The Executioner.
                          (beat)
                    He's Bernie Crimmins.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Crimmins the fence?!  Are you out of
                    your tiny English mind?!

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Why not?

                                      MACLEOD
                    They say he'd sell his own mother
                    for two pennies... he breaks people's
                    legs for breakfast!

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    You worry too much.
                          (beat)
                    Besides, he doesn't have a mother.

      They approach the back of the pub -- and get the BUZZ.  Their
      hands instinctively go to their hilts as they round a POST
      to find --

      BERNIE CRIMMINS

      a coarse, tough-looking gent seated at a table, near a
      sideboard loaded with STOLEN STERLING and other items.  Two
      brutal HENCHTHUGS flank him.  Resting beside him, within
      easy reach -- his huge EXECUTIONER S AXE.

      MacLeod and Fitzcairn share a look.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Great plan this is.

      Crimmins is chomping on a leg of lamb, watching Fitzcairn
      and MacLeod as it they might be next on the menu.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (aside)
                    Does he know he can actually cut the
                    meat off the bone first?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Do you want to tell him?
                          (louder, to Crimmins)
                    Mr. Crimmins, I presume!

                                      CRIMMINS
                    Who the hell wants to know?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    I'm the one that Johnny Whipsnade
                    sent.  Hugh Fitzcairn?

      Crimmins grunts and tosses the lamb aside.  He wipes his
      hands on the Thug beside him, reaches into his filthy shirt --
      withdraws a PAPER and lays it on the table.

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                    The floor plans to the Tower...

      He grabs eagerly for it -- WHAP! Crimmins' paw slaps down on
      the hand-drawn map.

                                      CRIMMINS
                      Forgetting something, are we?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Right, of course.  A hundred guineas,
                    as agreed.

      He fumbles with his purse, starts to open it -- Crimmins
      grabs away the entire purse.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    You're welcome.

      He starts to reach for the map  - once again Crimmins' hand
      slams down.

                                      CRIMMINS
                    Well, see, we have a little problem
                    here.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What problem?

                                      CRIMMINS
                    Your man told you the wrong price. 
                    It's two hundred.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    That's robbery!

      Crimmins flashes a lopsided grin.

                                      CRIMMINS
                    Yeah.  Times is tough all over.
                          (beat)
                    Take it or leave it.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    But I don't have another hundred.
                          (beat, to MacLeod)
                    MacLeod?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (firmly)
                    No.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    I'll pay you back.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I ve heard that one before.

      Fitzcairn points to the door excitedly.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    It's Connor MacLeod!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Where?

      MacLeod turns and looks.  Fitzcairn uses the opportunity to
      pick MacLeod's purse and toss it to Crimmins.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    That's my money!

      He starts to step forward --

      Crimmins casually swings up his heavy EXECUTIONER'S AXE and
      SLAMS it on the table.  The sound echoes in the ale-house.

                                      CRIMMINS
                    Not any more.

      And OFF his menacing leer --96515  "The Stone of Scone"    15.   Final Shooting Script 12/10/96




      it's dark as MacLeod cautiously pokes his head inside.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Fitzcairn?  Fitzcairn!
                          (no answer)
                    Idiot.  Can't leave him alone for
                    one minute.

      He slinks quietly inside.  In the gloom, we see TAPESTRIES,
      COATS OF ARMS adorning the walls.  MacLeod peers around, but
      Fitzcairn is nowhere to be seen.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (hoarse whisper)
                      Fitzcairn?

      Then a hoarse whisper comes back --

                                      FITZCAIRN (O.S.)
                      MacLeod... over here!

      MacLeod, the SACK over his shoulder, moves towards a corner
      where we see the SLIGHT GLOW of lantern light.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Stop playing... we've work to do!

      He rounds the corner -- and his face drops.

      FITZCAIRN

      stands there, a flintlock PISTOL aimed at his temple.  A
      GUARD has him captured, and has his arms shackled.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (disbelief)
                    How do you manage it?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    It's not my fault, he took me by
                    surprise.
                          (beat)
                    I think you'd better give up.

      MacLeod raises his sword, ready to make a stand.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It'll take more than one man to make
                    me yield.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Well, yes... I was meaning to get
                    around to that.

      BEAT.  MacLeod swings around to find himself facing --

      TWO MORE GUARDS

      who have slipped in behind him, swords drawn, one holding a
      PISTOL at his side.

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.

      MacLeod turns suddenly -- throws the SACK at Fitzcairn's
      captor, knocks him down.  As the man falls, MacLeod whirls
      to face the others, brandishing his sword.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Who wants it first?

      One of the Guards swings up his pistol -- and FIRES.

      MACLEOD

      dodges aside at the moment he fires, and --

      FITZCAIRN

      is hit square in the ass.

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                    AGHH!

      He hops around, gritting his teeth in pain.  MacLeod turns
      to the Guards, swings -- and KNOCKS the pistol from the man's
      hand, and swings to face the other.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Drop your weapons and I'll show mercy!

                                      FITZCAIRN
                          (through his teeth)
                    No...!  No mercy... NO MERCY!
                          (re his wounded ass;
                          to MacLeod)
                    I blame you for this.

      The GUARDS rush in.

1510CONTINUED: (2)1510

      MACLEOD

      dodges and dips, flipping over a table, jumping over it,
      passing Fitzcairn.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    It's your own fault.

      THE TWO GUARDS

      close in

      MACLEOD

      fights, holding both of them at bay --

      FITZCAIRN

      his hands still manacled, delivers a vicious KICK to one
      Guard's butt.

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                    See how you like it!

      As the Guard turns -- Fitzcairn HEADBUTTS him.  The Guard
      staggers back.  So does Fitzcairn.

      THE THREE GUARDS

      regroup, making a united front As they dome at MacLeod, swords
      out.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    MacLeod!  Save yourself!

      MACLEOD

      looks at the approaching swords then seems to do exactly
      that.  He turns and RUNS away from them, towards the WALL.

      THE GUARDS

      go after him.

      FITZCAIRN

      reacts in horror.

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                          (dismayed)
                    Wait!  Wait!  I didn't mean it. 
                    Save me too!

      MACLEOD

      races for the wall, where a ROPE hangs well above head-height --
      it secures one of the WALL HANGINGS.  MacLeod LAUNCHES off a
      table, jumps -- GRABS the rope -- and SWINGS back at the
      approaching Guards in an Errol Flynn swing.

      ON THE GUARDS

      as MacLeod SWINGS INTO THEM, planting both feet into the
      first one -- sends them tumbling backwards into a heap.

      MacLeod releases his rope -- and a huge WALL HANGING plummets
      down on the fallen Guards, tangling them.  They stare at the
      fallen Guards a moment.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    I could have done that.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Don't start on me.  Quick now, the
                    chains!

      Fitzcairn places his manacled arms against a wall.  MacLeod
      WHACKS the chain with his sword, cutting it.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Now let's get the bloody hell out of
                    here.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Without the jewels?!

      A BELL sounds, echoes through the halls.  We hear FOOTSTEPS
      of what could be a REGIMENT running through the tower.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Either that, or without your head.

      He turns and takes off.  Fitzcairn follows, grimacing.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                      MacLeod... Not so fast... I'm
                      wounded...

      As they HEAD OUT, the sound of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS behind them --


      A radio plays a big band tune.  Amanda is wearing a sexy
      little slip.  She is kissing MacLeod's fingers, but it's
      clear MacLeod is not with the program.  His thoughts are
      elsewhere.

                                      AMANDA
                    Am I boring you?

                                      MACLEOD
                    What?

      Seeing this isn't the direction she had hoped, she sits up.

                                      AMANDA
                    MacLeod, I think you're taking this
                    a little too hard.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The man has no honor at all.

                                      AMANDA
                    Okay, so he cheated you.  The question
                    is, what are we going to do about
                    it?

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's done.  There s nothing to do
                    about it.

                                      AMANDA
                    It breaks my heart to see you like
                    this.
                          (with resolve)
                    If this Stone is so important to
                    you, I say we go and get it.

                                      MACLEOD

                    a little longer.

                    you the only one who can be selfless.

                          (resigned)
                    The Stone is in Westminster Abbey. 
                    It's been locked up tight as a drum
                    for the past 230 years.

      Amanda rubs thumb and forefinger together.

                                      AMANDA
                    Locks are my specialty.

                    We couldn't handle it ourselves and
                    there's nobody else crazy enough to
                    try it.

      There's an explosion of KNOCKING at the door.

      BEAT.  They look at each other.  Amanda gives a "why not"
      shrug.  Amanda gets off the bed, goes to the door and opens
      it, just as --

      FITZCAIRN

      launches himself at the door staggers past Amanda -- and
      lands on the bed, on top of MacLeod.

                    you ever forgive me.

      His BREATH wafts over MacLeod in a nauseating wave.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Could you breathe in another
                      direction?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    For two hundred and thirty years the
                    memory of that betrayal has been
                    like a curse hanging over me.
                          (beat)
                    Please, just give me a chance to
                    make it up to you.

      MacLeod and Amanda trade looks.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (finally)
                    All right.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    You mean it?

      Fitzcairn grabs his hand and babbles gratefully.

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                    Thank you... thank you.  You won't
                    be sorry.

      He kisses MacLeod on the mouth with drunken joy.  MacLeod
      pulls away.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm already sorry.

      And OFF this --


      A plaque near the entrance reads "CLERMONT CLUB".  The
      CLIENTELE wandering in are carriage trade.  Older, monied,
      stiff.  In the hallway are expensive bronze busts, china on
      tables, etc.

      Amanda, dressed to impress, is breezing in.  She's immediately
      stopped by a distinctive looking BUTLER.

                                      BUTLER
                    I'm sorry Madam.  I'm afraid the
                    Clermont Club is a members only
                      establishment.

                                      AMANDA
                    Really.  From all the action I see,
                    I thought it was a morgue.
                          (beat)
                    Tell Mr. Crimmins that I'm here to
                    see him.

      She hands him a card, and he scans it doubtfully.

                                      BUTLER
                    Very good, Madam.

      He goes to a nearby door -- KNOCKS once -- and enters.  Amanda
      begins to finger the objects d'art in the room as if doing
      inventory.

      The Butler clears his throat O.S. as he returns.  Amanda
      withdraws her hand from an expensive piece of porcelain.

                                      BUTLER (CONT'D)
                          (frowning)
                    Lord Crimmins will see you now.

                                      AMANDA
                          (as she passes)
                    Quelle surprise.


      A grand room, quiet elegance, wood paneling -- unlike the
      place we last saw Crimmins hold court.  He's now seated behind
      a huge a Regency table, where he's been dining alone on
      Georgian silver, clad in an elegant Saville Row suit.  Two
      beefy, suited BODYGUARDS flanking him.  Behind him on the
      wall, the CRIMMINS COAT OF ARMS: two crossed HEADSMEN S AXES.

      He stands graciously as Amanda enters.

                                      CRIMMINS
                    My dearest Amanda.

      He moves to kiss her hand.  They've done business over the
      centuries, but she hasn't seen him in years.  Crimmins has
      adopted a "posh" accent along with his manners.

                                      AMANDA
                    Lord Crimmins?  You bought a title?

                                      CRIMMINS
                    One doesn't buy a title, Amanda.
                          (a smile)
                    I merely helped the Royal Family out
                    of rather nasty business.  A set of
                      unfortunate photographs came into my
                      possession.

      Amanda looks over the room.

                                      AMANDA
                    Not exactly unfortunate for you.

      He shrugs, extracts a cigar from a nearby humidor and snips
      off the end.

                                      CRIMMINS
                    A matter of being at the right place
                    at the right time.

                                      AMANDA
                    That's my Bernie.... always working
                    the angles.

                                      CRIMMINS
                    It's Lord Crimmins, if you don't
                    mind.
                          (beat)
                    So what brings you to see your old
                    friend?

                                      AMANDA
                    I have a deal lined up, Bernie...
                    but I need a little advance.

                                      CRIMMINS
                    How much?

                                      AMANDA
                    Fifty thousand pounds.

                                      CRIMMINS
                    Sorry.  The bottom dropped out of
                    the art market.

                                      AMANDA
                    It's not art.

                          (a dramatic beat)
                    It's a stone.  A priceless stone.
                          (beat)
                    It's the score of the twentieth
                    century, Bernie... makes the Crown
                    Jewels look like dirt.

                                      CRIMMINS
                    So why come to me?

                                      AMANDA
                    Because you're the only one I know
                    who can handle something this big.

      Crimmins mulls it over as he pours two flutes of champagne,
      hands her one.

                                      CRIMMINS
                    Here's my preposition.  A seventy-
                    thirty split on this stone.

      Amanda nearly gags.

                                      AMANDA
                      Seventy-thirty?!  Get serious.  Why
                    would I take that?

                                      CRIMMINS
                    Because your luck at the gaming tables
                    has been abysmal and you owe the
                    Curzon Street boys forty-seven
                    thousand four hundred and eighty six
                    pounds... and they're going to break
                    your lovely legs.
                          (a smile)
                    Cheers.

      He toasts her with the champagne.

                                      AMANDA
                          (beat, defeated)
                    Okay, it's a deal.  Sixty-forty.

      Crimmins smiles.

                                      CRIMMINS
                    I like you, Amanda.  As much as I
                    like anyone.

                                      AMANDA
                    You're warming my heart, Bernie.

      He nods at the CROSSED AXES behind him.

                                      AMANDA
                      Perfectly.

      And OFF her forced smile --

      FADE IN:


      Amanda wanders -- bumping into doors, sipping from a hip
      flask, HUMMING "Jingle Bells".  She doesn't panic in the
      least when a BOBBY approaches, looking severe.

                                      BOBBY
                    You can't be in here, Miss.  We're
                    closed.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96515  "The Stone of Scone"    36.   Final Shooting Script 12/10/96

1520CONTINUED:1520

                                      AMANDA
                    But it's Christmas.  Won't you have
                    a lil bit of Christmas cheer with
                    me?

      The Bobby ignores the thrust-out flask and takes her elbow,
      trying to guide her out.

                                      BOBBY
                    No madam, not while on duty.

                                      AMANDA
                    I've only come to the Abbey to toast
                    the dead soul of my poor departed
                    mother.
                          (beat)
                    Please.
                          (offering it)
                    To Mother.
                          (beat)
                    After all... It is Christmas.

      The Bobby glances around, takes a polite swig.  A grimace as
      he swallows.

                                      BOBBY
                    What the dickens is in here?

                                      AMANDA
                          (no longer slurring)
                    Something to separate the men from
                    the boys.

      The Bobby suddenly staggers.  Amanda holds him up, leads him
      towards a CLOAKROOM DOOR.  She OPENS the door, aims him inside --
      he falls into the cloakroom, out cold.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                      Nighty-night.


      Empty as a church.  One fabric covered CHAIR dominates the
      far wall.  MacLeod and Fitzcairn enter carrying ropes,
      crowbars, picks.  They stop as they see the chair.  MacLeod
      gazes at it, visibly moved.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There it is.

      Amanda peers around, doesn't see what he's getting at.

                                      AMANDA
                    Where?  There's nothing but a chair.

                    It's under the chair.  Right where
                    it's been for all these centuries.
                          (beat)
                    Come on, Fitz.

      He starts a reverential walk towards it with Fitzcairn.

      Amanda suddenly grabs MacLeod's arm.

                                      AMANDA
                    Quiet!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (listens)
                    I don't hear anything.

                                      AMANDA
                    Someone's coming!

      They look around -- there's nowhere to hide in the Great
      Hall.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Quick... I know where you can hide.

      The trio dart back into the corridor.


      They race into the corridor.

                                      AMANDA
                    In there!  Quick...

      She opens the cloakroom door MacLeod and Fitzcairn duck in.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    What about you?

                    I'll handle him like the last one.

      She closes the door on them -- pulls the KEYS she took from
      the Bobby -- and quietly LOCKS the door.


      In the darkness of the closet they hear a loud snore.  MacLeod
      uses his flashlight -- illuminating the passed-out Bobby. 
      Fitzcairn has his ear pressed to the door.  They hear a loud
      CLICK.

      MacLeod is puzzled.  He gently turns the handle it doesn't
      move.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    She's locked us in.

      Fitzcairn tries the door, too.  No action.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Why would she do that to us?!

                                      MACLEOD
                    To get herself into the building
                    with her tools...
                          (grim beat)
                    And get rid of her "partners" at the
                    same time.

                    Why would she want to do that?  The
                    Stone's worth nothing to her.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (a shrug)
                    She's Amanda.

      Fitzcairn tries his shoulder on the door.  All he succeeds
      in doing is hurting his shoulder.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Forget it.  By the time you break
                    down the door, every cop in
                      Westminster will be waiting for us.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    What do we do?

      Suddenly it all comes clear to MacLeod.  He smiles brightly.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Wait.  She'll be back.  She's looking
                    for the Stone.


      Amanda is at the CORONATION CHAIR, ripping out upholstery,
      and still can't find the bloody Stone.  She s frantic,
      frustrated and pissed...

                                      AMANDA
                    Where is it!?

      ANGLE - THE CHAIR

      nothing but a large unimpressive STONE is visible under the
      seat.  Amanda slumps on the chair, sitting on the Stone,
      despairing.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Bernie's not going to like this.


      Amanda stands by the open door as MacLeod and Fitzcairn step
      out.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (smug)
                    I guess you need us to help you move
                    it.

                                      AMANDA
                    I need you to help me find it.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (amused)
                    What do you mean?  It's right there. 
                    Under the chair.


      MacLeod, Fitzcairn and Amanda stand by the coronation chair.

                                      AMANDA
                    This is a joke.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No joke, Amanda.  That... is the
                    Stone Of Scone.

      He points to the Stone.  We PUSH IN ON:

      A three hundred and fifty pound block of SANDSTONE sitting
      right under the chair, among the granite slates.  (NOTE: 
      The Stone is known to many people.  Please duplicate as
      accurately as possible its appearance in 1950, before being
      broken.)

                                      AMANDA
                    This?!  It's nothing but a stupid
                    rock!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not just any rock.

      He clears away the mess on the CHAIR to see it better, places
      a hand on the Stone.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (with feeling)
                    Legend has it that this is the stone
                    Jacob lay his head on when he dreamt
                    of heaven.  That whoever sits on it,
                    sits on the Throne of Scotland.  The
                    English stole it....
                          (moved)
                    Now we'll have it back.

      He jams a CROWBAR under the Stone.  Fitzcairn jams one in
      the other side.

                                      AMANDA
                    A rock.
                          (beat)
                    I went through all this for a lousy
                    chunk of rock.


      CLOSE - A NEWSPAPER

      a composite indenti-sketch of AMANDA.  It's not very
      flattering.

                                      AMANDA (O.S.)
                          (grousing)
                    I'm much prettier than this.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

      MACLEOD, AMANDA AND FITZCAIRN

      huddled in a corner, looking at the paper.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Don't you think I'm prettier than
                    this?  The eyes are too close
                    together.  The nose is all wrong.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, as long as it doesn't look
                    like you, we'll be okay.
                          (frowns)
                    But they got the license number.

      They glance around nervously -- the pub is almost deserted. 
      One CUSTOMER reading a paper.  One or two others.

                                      AMANDA
                    Maybe we should leave the country
                    for a while.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    What about the Stone?

                                      AMANDA
                    What about it?  Bernie Crimmins wants
                    his money or my head.
                          (beat)
                    I'm catching the night boat to
                    Algiers.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    I'm with you.
                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    What?  I've done my bit.  You've got
                    the Stone now.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    Fine.  You two pack up and start
                    moving out.

      Amanda and Fitzcairn rise.  MacLeod isn't moving.

                                      AMANDA
                    What about you?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm staying.

      Amanda shrugs and starts out with Fitzcairn.  As she does --

      ANGLE - THE CUSTOMER

      the one reading the paper.  As Amanda and Fitzcairn pass, he
      lowers it: we see he is the "BUTLER" from Crimmins' club.


      ON AMANDA

      perched uncomfortably on a wooden chair, surrounded by the
      three Detectives, now wearing shirt-sleeves, ties loosened,
      grim looks.

                                      AMANDA
                    I told you, I wasn't any where near
                    the place on Christmas.  I was out
                    caroling.

      Detective Harry leans closer.

                                      HARRY
                    Luv, I don't think you quite
                      understand the trouble you're in. 
                    Breaking into Westminster Abbey,
                    stealing a national treasure...

                                      AMANDA
                          (flip)
                    Really?  Which Westminster Abbey
                    would that be?

                                      HARRY
                    The charge is treason against the
                    state!

                                      AMANDA
                          (feisty)
                    I suppose you have proof.

                                      HARRY
                    The guard you drugged.  Remember
                    him?  He remembers you.  And he'll
                    swear to it.

                                      AMANDA
                    You call that proof?

                                      HARRY
                    I know how it is, innocent young
                    girl falls under the wrong influences.
                          (beat)
                    We know you were just being used by
                    those two men.  Give us the names...
                    and you might not grow old in prison.

                                      AMANDA
                    You'd be surprised.

      A CONSTABLE enters with a knock.  He whispers in Harry's
      ear.  Harry reacts with a scowl.

                                      HARRY
                    What?  No one knows she's here.

      He turns to Amanda.

                                      HARRY (CONT'D)
                    It seems you've been sprung.
                          (off Amanda's look)
                    Go on... you're free to go for now.

      Amanda gets the BUZZ.  She smiles and rises.

                                      AMANDA
                    Next time, be a little more careful
                    who you pick up.

      She stands up, preparing to leave --

      AMANDA'S POV - THE WAITING AREA

      where we see CRIMMINS and his two Bruisers all dressed up
      like they were going to a funeral.  He smiles at her and
      waggles his fingers.

      Amanda's smile wipes off.  She suddenly sits down.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    I've changed my mind.
                          (beat)
                    I want to talk about that deal now.

      And OFF this --


      A BED with two bodies rolling under the covers.  Muffled
      GIGGLING, male and female is in progress.

      Two bodies appear.  One belongs to an undressed Fitzcairn. 
      The other, an amply endowed barmaid wearing next to nothing.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    What are the three words you never
                    want to hear when making love?

                                      BARMAID
                    I give up.

      THE BEDROOM DOOR

      smashes off its hinges -- and the three DETECTIVES charge
      into the room, surrounding the bed.  They don't say anything. 
      They don't need to.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Whatever it is, you've got the wrong
                    man!  I'm not even a Scot!  Why would
                    I steal the Stone?

                                      HARRY
                    Save it for the magistrate.  Your
                    partner turned you in.

                                      FITZCAIRN

                    Can I get my pants?


      Fitzcairn and Amanda are in adjoining holding cells.  Trying
      not to look at each other.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Tell me, Miss Judas... did you sell
                    MacLeod out, too?  Did you get a
                    package deal for the two of us?

                                      AMANDA
                    I didn't have any choice.  Crimmins
                    was waiting for me.
                          (beat)
                    I had to make the best of a bad deal.

      BEAT -- Fitzcairn puts his hand to his neck.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Speaking of deals... what do you
                    think they'll do to us?

                                      AMANDA
                    The charge is treason.

                    I figure it's sixty-forty we'll get
                    the hangman.

                    You haven't got five thousand.

      MacLeod, dressed in a morning suit, holding a bowler in his
      hand, is making his pitch to WINSTON CHURCHILL.  (We don't
      see him, just his fist holding a cigar behind a desk.)

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's a sticky situation, Mr. Prime
                    Minister.  If the Scots learn of the
                    Stone being broken, it'll give them
                      a rallying cry.

                                      CHURCHILL
                    Bad business.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not to mention the idea of thieves
                    breaking into Westminster Abbey.
                          (beat)
                    I'd let this die a quiet death.

                                      CHURCHILL
                    One can't cover up something of this
                      magnitude.  If the Press found out,
                    they'd tear me apart.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then use the Press, sir.  Issue a
                    Press release.
                          (beat)
                    Tell them it was all a schoolboy
                    lark... and the Stone has been
                    returned by Scotland Yard.

                                      CHURCHILL
                    I sense something more here than
                    love of King and Country, MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (squirming)
                    It's personal, sir.

                                      CHURCHILL
                            (thoughtful)
                    It would be for the good of the
                    country.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Exactly.
                          (beat)
                    And you do have the Stone back.

      A pause while smoke rises from the bulldog's chair.

                                      CHURCHILL
                    Good man, MacLeod.  Your service was
                      invaluable to us during the great
                    war.
                          (beat)
                    And England repays her debts.
                          (firm)
                      I consider this one paid in full.

      He reaches the chubby hand up to shake MacLeod's hand.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Absolutely, Mr. Churchill.

      And OFF this --
