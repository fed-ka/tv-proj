THE STREET - NIGHT
CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN as he streaks out the door and jumps
into the adjacent doorway, immediately peering down the
street. He spies the YOUNG MAN and RITA walking about
three quarters of a block down and follows them, keeping
out of sight. They turn occasionally to see if he's
around, then stop turning. They go around the corner and
disappear into a large apartment building. PUPKIN rushes
after them,
positioning himself across from
the building.
He searches
the windows for some clue as to
where they
have gone.
Finally a set of lights go on on
the fourth
floor and a
MAN's shadow is seen closing two
sets of
blinds.

THE APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER - NIGHT
PUPKIN enters the building and finds himself in a small
entranceway. The door to the lobby is locked. Next to
the door, on the wall, are listed the tenants, their
apartment numbers and a button next to each name. There is
an intercom speaker. There are eight apartments listed on
the fourth floor, running from 4A to 4H. PUPKIN looks them
over, takes a deep breath and pushes 4A.

YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
It is an extremely well-furnished studio apartment with all
the requirements of a contemporary bachelor pad -- an
imitation bearskin rug, nice bookshelves including an
elaborate stereo system, recessed lighting, including a
soft spotlight on the Queen-sized bed with its pseudo-satin
cover. The YOUNG MAN and RITA stand in the middle of the
room. RITA looks about uneasily. No intercom buzzer sounds.
YOUNG MAN
Welcome to the pleasure dome.
RITA
You don't kid around, do you?
YOUNG MAN
(smiling)
I do alright. What's your libation?
RITA
Huh?
YOUNG MAN
Your potion. Your drink.
RITA
Bourbon and soda.
Make it light.
The YOUNG MAN goes to his chic little bar and starts fixing
RITA a strong bourbon and soda. He also fixes himself a
strong scotch and water. As he works, they talk.
YOUNG MAN
You from the South?
RITA
Me?
YOUNG MAN
That's what Southern people drink.
Lots of bourbon.
RITA
What do people from Jersey drink?
YOUNG MAN
I make it a point to study things
like that. It's important to know
people's backgrounds, their tastes,
their culture. It gives you a little
head start.
The YOUNG MAN turns from the bar and hands RITA her drink.
YOUNG MAN
I'm Chet. Whom do I have the
pleasure of serving?
RITA
I'm Mary.
YOUNG MAN
Pleased to meat you, Mary. (He lifts
his glass) To our evening.

YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
RITA is seated on the couch. The YOUNG MAN is putting a
record on the phonograph. Once again, the intercom doesn't
sound. PUPKIN has drawn another blank.
YOUNG MAN
Leisure is America's fastest growing
industry. Did you know that? Think
about it. Short work weeks, more
vacation. People need something to
do with all that time and that's where
I come in. Leisure Villages, Inc.
We buy land an hour or so outside
your metropolitan centers. We set
up the bungalows, dig some lakes, lay
out a golf course, you know, fix the
whole place up so it's usable. Then
young, personable guys like me show
the people around. It the guy seems
tight, we point out the investment
factor. If he's a swinger, well,
the bungalows are very private. If
he's a sports nut, we talk up skiing
and fishing and tennis.
The phonograph starts playing Burt Bachrach.
YOUNG MAN
What's your work, Mary?
The YOUNG MAN walks back to her and stands over her.
RITA
Me.
I fly for National.

YOUNG MAN
Did you know that you have remarkable
hair?
RITA
Yeah? You know what?
I feel like
going to a movie.
YOUNG MAN
Now?
RITA
Sure. Why not? It's only twenty of
ten. We can make a ten o'clock show.
The YOUNG MAN takes her hands and looks deep into her eyes.
YOUNG MAN
Why don't we make our own movie?
RITA
No.
I don't think so.
YOUNG MAN
Don't be so uptight. Give it a chance.
RITA
I want to go to the movies, that's all.
YOUNG MAN
We can go to the movies later.
RITA pulls her hands away.
RITA
Let's stop playing games, okay.
I'm not a kid.
YOUNG MAN
You have something against pleasure?
RITA
I'm just not interested in being
tonight's ritual sacrifice, okay?

clear the air.
RITA
There's nothing wrong with me.
YOUNG MAN
Then it's me?
RITA
I don't even know you.
YOUNG MAN
Then find out. Sex is a great way
of breaking down barriers.
RITA
I don't think so.
YOUNG MAN
I'm sure this could lead to something
beautiful.
The YOUNG MAN kisses RITA roughly.
YOUNG MAN
Passive resistance, huh?
RITA
Let's just write this thing off as
a big mistake. What do you say?
YOUNG MAN
What's wrong with me?
RITA
Nothing.
I just want to go home.
YOUNG MAN
I can see I'm not turning you on.
RITA

You noticed that, huh?
YOUNG MAN
Come on.

What do you want?
RITA keeps walking out of the entranceway and onto the
street. PUPKIN is at her side.
PUPKIN
Don't be angry with me.
I was worried
about you, that's all.
RITA
Just go home and leave me alone.
PUPKIN take off his jacket and puts if around RITA's
shoulders.
PUPKIN

RITA
I'm so bad.
I'm such a dummy.

helps RITA out of the taxi. A dime bounces at PUPKIN's
feet.
CAB DRIVER'S VOICE
Stuff it, big spender!
PUPKIN pays no attention.
He walks RITA to her front
stoop.
RITA
Well, I guess you're entitled to come
up for coffee.
PUPKIN
That's okay, Rita. You're tired and
I know I'm not always the easiest guy
to be with.
There is a pause.
RITA
(puzzled)
What do you want, Rupert?
PUPKIN
(softly)
You don't understand anything, do you?
I love you, Rita. I want to change
your life ... if you'll only give me a
chance.
RITA just shakes her head sadly.
PUPKIN
Look, what if I arranged it so you
could meet Jerry? You'd have to
believe me if you heard it from him.
RITA
There's no ...
PUPKIN
I'll arrange that, Rita. We'll all
go out to dinner some night or maybe
out to his place, on a weekend. You'll
see. The trouble with you is you've
got no faith. Now go to bed and get a
good rest and I'll see you in a couple
of days.
PUPKIN gives RITA a very gentle, sweet kiss on the
forehead.
PUPKIN

clock, which moves in bites towards 11:30 to Broadway as
it looks to PUPKIN in the booth -- that cavalcade of
hustlers, whores, housewives, kids, weirdos and working
people; and SHOTS of various people waiting to use the
phone -- their impatience, anger, disgust. Each time one
of them arrives, PUPKIN pretends to thumb through the phone
book and dial a number. WE WATCH him chatting with
animation until the waiting party leaves. Then WE SEE him
push the coin return to retrieve his dime. Finally, PUPKIN
takes a last look at the clock.

You know the secret of dieting, Jerry?
Grapefruit. It's good for you. It's
filling. And it's low in calories.
LANGFORD
(to the camera)
Take note of that, you ladies.
PUPKIN
As a matter of fact, yesterday I went
to the outdoor market near where I
live and I bought twenty grapefruit.
The grocer looked at me and said,
"What are you gonna do with all those?"
So I bent over and told him (in a
confidential tone) "I'm gonna take 'em
back to Florida and set 'em free!"

Pardon me?
RECEPTIONIST
Mr. Langford's secretary has no
record of any appointment.
PUPKIN
Well, technically speaking, I don't
actually have an appointment. Jerry
asked me to call him today and when
I couldn't get through, I thought ...
As PUPKIN talks, a VISITOR has entered and stands behind
him waiting for the RECEPTIONIST's attention.
RECEPTIONIST
I see.
(Into the phone) He says Mr.
Langford
asked him to call. (To
PUPKIN)
Mr. Langford's secretary wants
to know
what this is in reference to.
The RECEPTIONIST glances past PUPKIN to the VISITOR
waiting.
RECEPTIONIST
(to PUPKIN)
Would you mind talking to her yourself?
The RECEPTIONIST hands the phone to PUPKIN and occupies
herself with the VISITOR.
PUPKIN
Hello? ... Jerry and I discussed
my being on the show last night and
he told me to call ... No. I don't
mind.
PUPKIN hands the phone back to the RECEPTIONIST.
PUPKIN
I'm supposed to wait.
The RECEPTIONIST listens to the phone for a moment and then
hangs up. The VISITOR has just disappeared into the back
offices. PUPKIN stands there, smiling politely at the
RECEPTIONIST who returns a professional smile.
PUPKIN
Who was that gentleman?

He's our executive producer.
PUPKIN
Oh, yes. I'm sure he is. But, you
see, I've already talked directly
with Jerry about my being on the show
and he told me to get in touch with
him. I'm just here to follow up on
that.
CATHY LONG
What do you do, Mr. Pupkin?
PUPKIN
Stand-up comedy.
CATHY LONG
Fine.
Where are you working?
PUPKIN
Well, right now I'm developing new
material.
CATHY
LONG

soon as you start
performing again,
let us know where
you are and I'll
send my assistant
down to check you
out.
PUPKIN
Sure. Sure. But that's not necessary,
Miss Long. Jerry and I already went
over all this.
CATHY LONG
Does Jerry know your work?
PUPKIN
(nodding)
Yes.
I don't think he does.
CATHY LONG
You don't happen to have a tape or a
demo that we might listen to?
PUPKIN
Oh, sure. I've got lots of tapes.
That's no problem.
CATHY LONG
Good. Why don't you just send one
to us and I assure you we'll listen
to it promptly.
PUPKIN
Great. I'll do that. I can see
that'd be a lot easier for Jerry.
Thanks a lot, Miss Long.
CATHY LONG
Don't mention it, Mr. Pupkin.

PUPKIN
I'm really in a hurry, Marsha ...
MARSHA

PUPKIN
I thought that was you.
That was
some stunt.
MARSHA
What did he say?
PUPKIN
We didn't talk about you.
MARSHA
You know Jerry?
PUPKIN
Yeah.
MARSHA thrusts an envelope into PUPKIN's hands.
MARSHA
Give him this for me.
PUPKIN
Why don't you ...
MARSHA
Because I can't! Please. I need
your help. You'll be my friend forever.
Come on. I'll buy you something.
What do you want?
She takes a great messy bunch of bills out of her raincoat
pockets and jams them into PUPKIN's hands.
PUPKIN
I don't want this.
MARSHA
Take it.
I can get all I want.
PUPKIN shrugs and pockets the money.
PUPKIN
Okay.

Don't try. Do it.

Okay.
Okay.
MARSHA
How soon can you get it to him?
PUPKIN
I don't know. Couple a days.
MARSHA

You'd better.
MARSHA turns and walks in the direction from which they
came. CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN who walks on for a block or
so, then opens the envelope. It contains a set of
apartment keys, a scrap of hand-knitted woolen cloth and a
note in lipstick that reads: "I've made you a sweater,
honey. Come try it on. I miss you. Love, M. 74 East

PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAY
PUPKIN enters. WE SEE that it is a small room, furnished
by the hotel in the plainest way. Nicely-done home-made
collages of show business figures decorate the drab green
walls. The room is neat and clean. PUPKIN goes directly
to a plain table which holds two tape recorders -- one a
small cassette the other a large table tape recorder. He
picks up the microphone of the larger one and speaks into
it.
PUPKIN
Testing.
Testing.
Testing.
In the following montage, we hear in the background the
replay of his "testing, testing testing" and various
other noises -- a bit of his voice taped, a burst of
laughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward,
a sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music. At the
same time, the CAMERA PANS about the room.
We look
at the collages which include all the obvious show business
figures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin
and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages
also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia
Childs, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford
Irving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a special
Kennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black,
Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also a
trio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray.
There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford
in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters,
Carson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable
library of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians,
treasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores
of tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked,
i.e., "LANGFORD MONOLOGUES:
7/5/72 to 9/9/72." "MISC.
MONOLOGUES 6/13/68 to 8/1/69."

PUPKIN sitting before the tape recorder lost in thought.
Finally, he starts the larger recorder and lifts the mike.
PUPKIN
First, Miss Long. Thanks very much
for your help at the office and for
passing this along to Jerry. I
appreciate it more than you know.
PUPKIN stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few
beats. He then starts the large recorder.
PUPKIN
Now, Jerry. Before I begin, I just
want to thank you for listening to
this material and for the opportunity
that you've given me. You know, lots
of people think that guys like you,
you know, people who have made it,
lose their feeling for struggling
young talent such as myself. But
now I know from experience that those
people are just cynics, embittered
by their own failure. I know, Jerry,
that you're as human as the rest of us,
if not more so. (pause) Oh well, I
guess there's no point going on about
it. You know how I feel. So let's get
on with the show.
The best of Rupert
Pupkin! I've sketched out this little
introduction in order to save you a
little time. So close your eyes and
imagine it's exactly six o'clock.
You're standing in the wings and we
hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike
up your theme song.
PUPKIN pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the
theme song of the Jerry Langford Show, followed by the
voice of BERT CANTER, the announcer.
BERT CANTER'S VOICE
And now, direct from New York, it's
the Jerry Langford Show! Tonight,
with Jerry's special guest ...
PUPKIN deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his
own voice for that of CANTER's. The large tape recorder
keeps rolling.
PUPKIN
... the comedy find of the year making
his television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the
King of Comedy!
PUPKIN rapidly races the cassette tape forward, then pushes
down the "play" button. We hear a burst of thundering
applause. PUPKIN lets the applause run for a while and
then shuts it off. The large recorder keeps rolling.
PUPKIN
Now you come on, Jerry, and do your
monologue. Then, when the time comes,
this is how I see you introducing me.
You'll say something like this.
"Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to
do something a little bit different
tonight. It isn't often that you can
call someone a sure thing in the
entertainment business. After all,
the verdict is always in your hands.
But I think after you've met my next
guest, that you'll agree with me that
he's destined for greatness. So,
now, will you please give your warmest
welcome to the newest King of Comedy,
Rupert Pupkin!!!"
PUPKIN pushes the cassette and we hear another enormous
burst of applause. PUPKIN lets it run, listening intently.
He stands up and faces a wall of his room, still holding
the microphone. WE SEE that the wall is covered by a huge
blow-up of an audience laughing and applauding.

small flat box, neatly wrapped with the words 'FOR JERRY
LANGFORD" written clearly across the top in large print.
CATHY LONG emerges from one of the back corridors into the
reception area.
CATHY LONG
Yes?
PUPKIN
(suddenly a bit shy)
I didn't want to take any chances
with this ... uh ... Miss Long, so I
... uh ... thought I'd just bring it
here myself.
He hands CATHY LONG the package as though it contained
nitroglycerine.
CATHY LONG
We talked about this this morning,
did we, Mr. ... ?
PUPKIN
Pupkin.
Rupert Pupkin.
CATHY LONG
Oh, yes. It's been some day. (pause)
Well, I certainly appreciate your
bringing this over, Mr. Pupkin, and
we'll listen to it as soon as possible.
PUPKIN
Fine. Er ... you don't have any idea
how soon that might be?
CATHY LONG
Well, you can try checking with us
tomorrow. We might know something
by then. Otherwise, it'll have to
be Monday.
PUPKIN
What if I just sort of waited around
here today, just in case? I'll stay
out of the way.
CATHY LONG
You'd just be wasting your time,
Mr. Pupkin. We won't know anything
until tomorrow at the earliest.
PUPKIN
Oh, I wouldn't consider it a waste of
time at all.
I'd be glad to do it.
CATHY LONG
Look, why don't you try us tomorrow.
Okay?
PUPKIN
Tomorrow? ... Right. I'll do that.
Thanks a lot, Miss Long. And thank
Jerry.
CATHY LONG smiles at
PUPKIN and
goes, leaving PUPKIN
staring at a picture
of LANGFORD
on the wall. WE FIX on
LANGFORD a moment and
PULL BACK
to see LANGFORD in what
PUPKIN would imagine
his office
to be.

INT:
AN OFFICE - DAY
A large, corner office furnished in royal red, with high
ceilings and a huge desk. Potted palms and hydrangeas rest
on a marble floor. LANGFORD is moving about restlessly,
clutching PUPKIN's tape in one hand and waving it about.
PUPKIN is seated on a comfortable couch.
LANGFORD
Dynamite!
This is dynamite!
PUPKIN
(shyly)
You think so, Jerry?
LANGFORD
Look, I've been at this for fifteen
years, Rupert, and I haven't come up
with anything like this -- not me,
not any of my writers.
PUPKIN
(smiling with obvious
pleasure)
Well, I'm glad you like it, Jerry.
LANGFORD
Tell me something, Rube. (pause)
How do you do it? I'm not asking
to use the material myself. I just
want to know how you (LANGFORD waves
his arms in a gesture of frustration)
how you do it.
PUPKIN
Well, I don't know if I can explain
it, really.
LANGFORD
Come on.
Try, Rube.
PUPKIN
Well,
it just sort of comes. I think
about
my life, see, mainly about the
worst
parts, all the awful things, and
I just
try to see them in a funny light.
That's
all.
LANGFORD
(eagerly)
Is that what you do? The worst parts,
and then you look at them in a funny
light? Is that what you do?
PUPKIN
More or less. It's hard to describe
how its happens.
LANGFORD
But that's just it, Rube. It doesn't
happen for me. Why do you think the
show is in so much trouble? By the
time I've done my monologue, everyone
has switched to Carson. Maybe if you
did a little writing ... ?
PUPKIN
Sure, Jerry, I'd do anything I could
to help out.
LANGFORD
You would? Great. Why don't you
come out to my place this weekend
and we'll hash it out. I'm having
a few of my friends but we should be
able to get a little work in.
PUPKIN
Would you mind if I brought someone?
LANGFORD
(smiling)
A girl, Rube?
PUPKIN
A very special girl, Jerry.
LANGFORD
I'd love to meet her.

U.N. PLAZA - DAY
It is a bright morning. LANGFORD, attempting to camouflage
himself by wearing a cap over his eyes and his trench coat
collar turned up, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses,
walks out of the building. A DOORMAN is standing by the
door.
DOORMAN
Cab, Jerry?
LANGFORD
That's alright, thanks.
WE FOLLOW LANGFORD as he walks. Some people don't notice.
Others stare but leave him alone, a few commenting to their
companions and pointing at him. A CAB DRIVER pulls
alongside.
DRIVER
Hey, Jerry. My brother can sing
and juggle at the same time. How
about puttin' him on your show?
LANGFORD keeps walking.
DRIVER
How about it, Jerry?
LANGFORD
Sorry, I'm off duty.

LANGFORD stands at the corner, next to a middle-aged

LANGFORD pulls his cap a little more tightly around his
eyes.
WOMAN
You know something.
(She giggles)
I undress in front of you every night
and Larry here doesn't mind at all.
LARRY
I can't get anything started with her
until you're off the air. Your show
is ruining my sex life, Jerry.
LANGFORD
Well then, you'll just have to put
on a better show than I do.

WE SEE MARSHA trailing LANGFORD. LANGFORD notices her and
starts walking quickly. MARSHA walks quickly. LANGFORD
starts jogging. MARSHA starts jogging. Finally, LANGFORD
breaks into a sprint. MARSHA runs after him. LANGFORD
disappears into his office building. MARSHA arrives
several seconds later.
MARSHA

Just as MARSHA turns around, PUPKIN, unaware of her, walks
cheerfully into the building.

RECEPTION AREA OF JERRY LANGFORD SHOW OFFICES - DAY
PUPKIN enters. The same middle-aged, plump RECEPTIONIST
is seated behind the desk.
RECEPTIONIST
Yes, sir?
(recognizing him)
Oh, hi.
PUPKIN
Hi.
How are you?
RECEPTIONIST
Not bad.
PUPKIN
I'm fine.
RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?
PUPKIN
I'd like to see Jerry, please.
RECEPTIONIST
You are ... ?
PUPKIN
Mr. Pupkin.
RECEPTIONIST
Just a minute.
The RECEPTIONIST dials a number.
RECEPTIONIST
Mr. Pupkin is here ... That's right
... (to PUPKIN) She'll be with you
in a minute.
PUPKIN
Who?
RECEPTIONIST
Miss Long.
PUPKIN
But I wanted to see Jerry.
RECEPTIONIST
Mr. Langford's not in. Miss Long
will take care of you.
PUPKIN
Alright.
PUPKIN paces for a few beats. He smiles at the
RECEPTIONIST. A beat later, CATHY LONG comes out,
carrying the tape in its box.
CATHY LONG
Mr. Pupkin?
PUPKIN
How are you today?
CATHY LONG
Fine, Mr. Pupkin. Thank you for
your tape. We listened to it with
great interest. And, frankly, Mr. Pupkin,
we saw a lot of good things in what
you're doing. We feel you have good
potential. Very good potential.
PUPKIN
(smiling)
Thanks.
CATHY LONG
That's why I'll be honest with you,
Mr. Pupkin ...
PUPKIN
Yes?
CATHY LONG
We just don't think you're ready yet.
PUPKIN
(baffled)
Not ready?
CATHY LONG
Well, we just don't feel right now
that you're right for Jerry.
PUPKIN
(rapidly, half-listening)
Right for Jerry. Sure.
CATHY LONG
Some of the material ... some of the
one-liners, for instance ...
PUPKIN
Yes?
CATHY LONG
... were not very strong.
PUPKIN
You didn't care for some of the jokes,
is that it?
CATHY LONG
That"s right.
PUPKIN
Good. Good. I can take care of
that right way. Thanks. Just tell
me the ones you think should go.
That would be a big help. (to the
RECEPTIONIST) This is great. (to
CATHY LONG) Which ones?
CATHY LONG
Well, it's not just that, Mr. Pupkin.
You see, Jerry likes to panel his
guests, you know, chat with them
afterwards.
PUPKIN
Sure.
Sure.
CATHY LONG
And frankly, we just don't feel you've
got very much to talk about right now.
PUPKIN
But I've got my whole life to talk
about!
CATHY LONG
Which is interesting to you, I'm sure
and to your wife ... and to a few
friends. But we feel that you should
keep developing your act. Test it in
some live situations. There are a
number of clubs in the city you can
try. And after a reasonable period,
get in touch with us again and we'll
be glad to send someone down to check
out your progress.
PUPKIN stares at her for a few moments as the tension grows.
PUPKIN
May I ask you a question, Miss Long?
CATHY LONG
Of course.
PUPKIN
Are you speaking for Jerry?
CATHY LONG
Let's put it this way, Mr. Pupkin.
Mr. Langford has complete faith in
our judgment.
PUPKIN
I'm sorry to have to say this, Miss
Long, and I certainly don't want you
to take it personally, but I have to
tell you that I don't ... I don't
have faith in your judgment.
CATHY LONG
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way,
Mr. Pupkin. But I'm afraid there's
nothing that can be done about that.
PUPKIN
No ... No ... I'm afraid I'll have
to disagree with you again.
CATHY LONG
(with strained politeness)
That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin.
Now, if you'll excuse me, please, I
have some things to do. I'm sorry
the news isn't better.
CATHY LONG turns to go.
PUPKIN
Miss Long?
CATHY LONG turns back.
PUPKIN
When are you expecting Jerry in?
CATHY LONG
He won't be in until very late this
afternoon.
PUPKIN
That's fine. Thank you.
CATHY LONG stares at PUPKIN for a moment, glances at the
RECEPTIONIST and then goes. PUPKIN takes a seat in the
reception area. He smiles once more at the RECEPTIONIST.
The RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY
LONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN.
PUPKIN continues sitting there.
RECEPTIONIST
Is there anyone else you would
like to see?
PUPKIN
That's alright. I'm happy just
waiting.
A few beats pass in silence.
RECEPTIONIST
Well, would you mind waiting outside,
please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception
area, not a waiting room.
PUPKIN
I understand.
PUPKIN remains seated. A few more moments pass. Several
OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by the entranceway and glance at
PUPKIN. After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed
MAN in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices. He
goes over to PUPKIN, who stands.
OFFICIAL
Mr. Pupkin? I'm Raymond Wirtz, in
charge of security for the Langford
organization.
WIRTZ puts his arm on PUPKIN's shoulder and, as the
following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down
the corridor and into the elevator.
WIRTZ
Now I think you understand that we
have certain rules here that are
essential to the smooth functioning
of our operation.
PUPKIN
Sure.
Sure.
WIRTZ
And that without these rules, we really
wouldn't be able to function at our
best. You follow my point?
PUPKIN nods.
WIRTZ
Now one of these rules is that only
authorized personnel and those having
official business with our organization
are permitted on our premises. And
that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin,
to cooperate with us.
They have reached the elevator and WIRTZ has pushed the
button.
PUPKIN
You want me to leave the building.
WIRTZ
That's right. It's nothing personal,
Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job.
The elevator arrives. WIRTZ signals with his head that
PUPKIN should enter. PUPKIN gets in.
WIRTZ
Have a pleasant day.

STREET OUTSIDE THE LANGFORD BUILDING - DAY
PUPKIN comes out and takes up a position outside the door,
preparing to wait for LANGFORD. MARSHA sees him and comes
over to him.
MARSHA
Well, did you give it to him?
PUPKIN
(out of a daze)
Huh?
MARSHA
Did you get my letter to him?
PUPKIN
He's not in there.
MARSHA
Look, if you don't want to give it
him, okay. I'll get somebody
else. But don't try to con me.
PUPKIN
I told you I'd try and I will. I'm
going to wait for him right here.
MARSHA
Give me the envelope, huh?
PUPKIN
Sure, but ...
MARSHA
I saw him go in myself!
PUPKIN
Who?
MARSHA
Jerry!
PUPKIN
But they said he wasn't in.
MARSHA
Just give me the envelope.
PUPKIN
When did he go in?
MARSHA
Ten minutes ago! That's when.
PUPKIN
You sure?
MARSHA
Look, I saw him my ...
PUPKIN
And he hasn't come out?
MARSHA
I've been standing right here.

RECEPTIONIST
I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Langford's not in.
PUPKIN
I happen to know he is.
So would you
please tell him I'm here.
RECEPTIONIST
I'm sorry.
He's not in.
PUPKIN
You're putting your job on the line,
lady.
The RECEPTIONIST starts making a call inside. PUPKIN
glances at her and walks right in to the inner corridors.
He starts peering into the open doors of the offices that
line the corridor. The whole place is like a gigantic
maze. OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by him, taking no notice of
him. He continues wandering around desperately, completely
lost. A few beat later, he spots WIRTZ leading a pair of
SECURITY GUARDS. PUPKIN keeps peering into offices quickly
as he flees. The GUARDS and WIRTZ finally catch up to
PUPKIN at the steno pool and, after a brief chase around
the pool, they catch PUPKIN and subdue him. They start
dragging him out past the eyes of the OFFICE PERSONNEL.
PUPKIN
(calling as he is dragged)
Jerry! Jerry! (to WIRTZ) You're
going the have a hell of a lot of
explaining to do! (calling) Jerry!
WIRTZ
You had your warning, Mr. Krupkin.

MARSHA comes straight up to PUPKIN who is brushing himself
off. His eyes are glazed and distant.
MARSHA
Well?
PUPKIN
Huh?
MARSHA
Does he have it?
PUPKIN

Don't worry. I'll get it to him.

SUBURBAN TRAIN - DAY
PUPKIN and RITA are seated side by side. Since it is

CONDUCTOR has just finished taking PUPKIN's tickets. RITA
is edgy. PUPKIN is strangely calm and a little remote.
He is wearing his new suit.
RITA
What are we going to do?
PUPKIN
(patiently)
Look, I told you, I've got some work
to discuss with him. That's all.
RITA
But what about me?
PUPKIN
You're with me.
RITA
That's fine, but while you two are
talking, what am I going to do?
PUPKIN
You can chat with the other guests.
RITA
I'm sure they'll be thrilled hearing
about the wonderful world of draft beer.
(pause) Let's tell 'em I'm a model,
okay?
PUPKIN
What?
RITA
If they ask what I do, let's just say
I model. You don't mind pretending
just a little, do you?
PUPKIN
If it make you feel better.
There is a pause.
RITA
This is
a gas! Too bad nobody'll
believe
it. (pause) After you guys
are done
working, what happens? Are
we going
out someplace, or what?
PUPKIN
I'm sure Jerry has something arranged.
There is another pause.
RITA
What do
these people do for fun?
Do they
party or do freaky things
or just
get drunk or ... I mean,
What do
they do?
PUPKIN
I guess they just sit around and talk
and enjoy each other's company, like
anybody else.
RITA
Talk?!? What can you talk about
for three or four hours?!
PUPKIN
What do
you mean? They've got plenty
to talk
about. They do things.
All
kinds of
interesting things happen
to them
and then they talk about them.
What do
you think Jerry's show is all
about?
RITA
Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks.
That's what all those shows are. At
least they help you get to sleep.
There is a pause.
RITA
(glumly)
Boy, this is going to be some great
weekend.
I thought we were gonna
have some fun.
PUPKIN

Just take it easy, Rita.
Everything's

FADE TO:

A NEO-CLASSICAL MANSION
It is a large white house with colonial columns set in the
middle of a palatial estate whose rolling lawns are
punctuated with fine old trees. We circle around to the
back where LANGFORD, a handful of his FRIENDS (which can be
familiar television celebrities) and PUPKIN and RITA are
just finishing a lavish lunch on the patio. A pair of
SERVANTS are clearing the table and serving the coffee and
desert as the scene unfolds. As we arrive, we hear a loud
burst of laughter. PUPKIN is regaling the COMPANY with
stories.
PUPKIN
Oh, you have no idea how bad it's
gotten in New York. Now the muggers
are so efficient that, each time
they jump you, they take your name
and address and put you on a mailing
list. (the COMPANY chuckles) And
once you're on the list, you're in
real trouble, like this friend of
mine who was mugged thirty-two times
on his way home from work. (a little
laughter from the COMPANY)
A SERVANT places the desert, a little, elegant tart, in
front of PUPKIN and RITA.
PUPKIN
(to SERVANT)
Thanks.
The SERVANT smiles. As PUPKIN continues his story, he
glances occasionally at RITA who has begun to nibble at her
tart. PUPKIN also glances conspiratorially at LANGFORD
who smiles back.
PUPKIN
So what my friend does is get himself
a dog, one of those huge German
Shepherds. One night, he's walking
the dog in Central Park when he hears
this voice behind him. (in a German
accent) Okay, Harry, drop your
vallet and keep your hantz over your
head or I bite your little fanny off.
The COMPANY breaks up.
ONE GUEST
(to LANGFORD)
Looks like you've found yourself a
winner, Jerry.
LANGFORD
(looking at PUPKIN)
He's the one who found himself
a winner.
RITA looks up, smiles and blushes. The rest of the COMPANY
smiles benignly and grows attentive as RITA returns to
eating her tart. Suddenly she bites down on something
hard. She fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it. The
COMPANY giggles. It is the ring PUPKIN purchased at
Cartier's. The COMPANY applauds lightly and laughs.
LANGFORD lifts his wine glass.
LANGFORD
To Rita and Rupert -- a short engagement
and a long, happy marriage.
The COMPANY drinks with murmurs of "Hear! Hear!"
RITA

A SECOND GUEST

Oh, yes.

the ORCHESTRA strike up Mendelssohn's Wedding March.
Down
one aisle walks RITA, accompanied by the MAN whom PUPKIN
hit over the head at the bar. Down the other aisle marches
PUPKIN, accompanied by LANGFORD. The AUDIENCE cheers
wildly. The two COUPLES walk to the stage where a white-
haired OFFICIAL awaits them. BERT CANTER stands at his
side. PUPKIN and RITA disengage from their ESCORTS and
stand before the OFFICIAL. The music stops and the
AUDIENCE grows quiet.
OFFICIAL
We are met here in these extraordinary
circumstances to join this man and this
woman in holy wedlock. But, before we
begin, let me voice a personal word
of thanks to you, Rupert and to you,
Rita, for choosing me to perform this
prestigious ceremony. Because we are
on prime time, I am going to discard
my customary remarks in favor of a
few personal reflections.
When I was
principal at Clifton High and these
two were students, I had very little
faith that Rupert here would amount
to very much. But like his teachers
and his fellow students, I underestimated
this fine young man.
Some say that
this misjudgment is directly tied to my
recent dismissal as head of the Clifton
School System. But let me take this
opportunity to set the record straight.
Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were
most certainly destined for a great
career and a lifetime of happiness,
I voluntarily stepped down. I would
only here add my own wishes to those
of millions of viewers for their
continued health, wealth and
boundless success.
The OFFICIAL looks quickly past RITA and PUPKIN.

We'll be back to marry them in a minute,

DRIVER
This is it.
RITA
It's gorgeous!
PUPKIN is genuinely puzzled.
PUPKIN

You sure?
DRIVER
Look, friend, I wouldn't want to
tell you how many times I made this
trip.

That'll be three
seventy-five.
PUPKIN, still puzzled, hands him a five dollar bill.
PUPKIN
(abstractedly)
Keep it.
The DRIVER gets out and puts PUPKIN and RITA's bags,
which he had stacked on the front seat, onto the sidewalk.

Jonno nods politely but uncertainly.
JONNO

Mr. Langford asked you to come?
PUPKIN
That's right. Would you mind
taking those up? Jerry and I have
some work that may oblige me to
stay overnight.
JONNO
But Mr. Langford's not here.
PUPKIN
Out playing golf, right?
JONNO
(still puzzled and unsure)
That's right.
PUPKIN
Maybe he'll finally break a hundred.
JONNO
Maybe it's better if you came back ...
PUPKIN

That's alright. We don't mind waiting.
PUPKIN walks from the foyer into the living-room, leaving
JONNO staring after him holding the bags. RITA walks into

It is a handsomely furnished room, done in old American
antiques and other tasteful pieces. There is a grand piano
heavy with pictures in one corner and wall-to-wall
bookshelves that are mostly full and mixed with a balance
of classics and modern popular reading. The whole room
marks LANGFORD as a man of discernment. The shelves also
house a fine stereo and a small, discreet bar. RITA and
PUPKIN walk in like strangers in paradise, awed by the
obvious elegance and expense the room reflects.
PUPKIN
(as though he owned it)
How do you like it?
RITA
(admiringly)
I could live here.
PUPKIN
(smiling proudly)
It's the only way to live.
RITA stands in the center of the room, ill at ease, while
PUPKIN strolls about comfortably, picking up an ashtray
here, a cigarette case there, inspecting the artifacts for
inscriptions, clues, hints about LANGFORD's character and
life.
RITA
How come he isn't here?
PUPKIN
You heard the guy.
He's out playing
golf.
RITA
Didn't you tell him when we'd get here?
PUPKIN continues to move about the room, fielding RITA's
suspicious inquiries effortlessly.
PUPKIN
We didn't have time to iron out the
details. Now just relax. We're
the first guests, that's all.
RITA

It probably slipped Jerry's mind.
He has better things to think about
than what he tells his houseboy.
RITA
It's just not time way I expected it,
that's all.
There is a pause. PUPKIN continues his investigation.
He
has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room.
RITA
What do we do now?
PUPKIN is looking
at a picture of an American Gothic couple
standing in front
of a wood-frame house. As he comments on
the pictures, the
CAMERA PANS over them. They form a kind
of slide-show of
LANGFORD's life.
PUPKIN
These are Jerry's parents. His father
runs the Post office in Wolverine --
that's in North Dakota.
PUPKIN then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy
standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet (obviously
held by the boy) staring at its master.
PUPKIN
This one was in Newsweek. He started
giving these puppet shows when he was
still in grade school.
WE SEE a picture of a very young LANGFORD seated before a
microphone with some celebrity.
PUPKIN
And this is from his quiz show in
St. Louis. Can you believe it?
RITA
Sure I can.
PUPKIN
That was the name of the show.
WE MOVE to a picture of LANGFORD smiling at JACK PAAR.
PUPKIN
And here's when he wrote for Jack
Paar. He made a hundred and fifty
a week and look at him now.
Another picture of LANGFORD with a group of women sitting
in a studio.
PUPKIN
And this is his morning show.
A picture of LANGFORD standing in a park with his two boys,
eleven and eight.
PUPKIN
And his kids. He's divorced.
RITA, who has been only half-listening, has picked up a
small, beautifully enameled cigarette box.
RITA
Look at this. I love these kind of
things. Look at the work.
I've got
this thing about boxes.
RITA puts it down reluctantly, picks it up, then puts it
down again.

THE LIVING ROOM - DAY
RITA has just finished fixing herself a drink. She takes a
large sip and starts pacing around. PUPKIN is seated.
RITA
How much longer are we gonna have
to wait?
PUPKIN
I don't know. Until he gets back.
RITA.
Do we have to just sit here?
PUPKIN
He should be back pretty soon.
RITA
Doesn't he have any music or anything?
Let's get a little life into this place.
It's like a funeral parlor.
She walks over to the stereo and opens the cupboard beneath
it, revealing rows and rows of records.
RITA
This is more like it.
She pulls out a record.
PUPKIN
Come on, Rita.
RITA
Come on, yourself.
She puts the record on. Frank Sinatra starts singing "They
Can't Take That Away From Me." She takes a big sip of her
drink, puts it down and comes over to PUPKIN.
RITA
How about a little spin, handsome?
PUPKIN
(pulling back)
Here?
RITA snuggles into PUPKIN and starts dancing him around.
He resists feebly.
RITA
Come on, Rupert.
I came up here for
a good time.
PUPKIN gives in and starts
dancing with her in the
style of
the 1950's, elbow out, arm
up, box step. After a
few
moments, PUPKIN closes his
eyes. He has reached a
moment
of perfect bliss, his dream
girl in is arms. They
dance
silently as we hear Sinatra
singing.
SINATRA'S VOICE
The way you wore your hat,
The way we danced till three,
The memory of all that --
Oh no, they can't take that away from me,
No ... they can't take that away ...
from ... me.
The orchestra plays.
RITA
You never could dance, could you?
PUPKIN
How would you know?
RITA
Oh I danced with you a couple of
times -- at the Sigma U party.
PUPKIN
You were there with Tommy Winston.
RITA
You didn't ask me.
PUPKIN
That's the one time I did ask you
and you went with him anyway.
RITA
Well, I couldn't go with you!
PUPKIN
Why not?
RITA
Be serious, Rupert.

The music has stopped momentarily and PUPKIN and RITA
disengage. PUPKIN looks lovingly at RITA.
PUPKIN
Well, it's all ended happily and
that's what counts.
RITA grows jumpy under his gaze.
She looks around.
RITA
I wonder what the rest of this
place looks like?
PUPKIN
I'm sure it's all very nice.
RITA
(gaily)
Well, there's only one way to find out.
RITA scampers over to the stairs and pauses on the first

RITA bounds up the stairs.

CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN up the stairs.

Finally, PUPKIN opens the door to another room.

It is clearly LANGFORD's bedroom with a few clothes strewn

PUPKIN

What are you doing, Rita?
RITA
I love it! All those millions of
women out there dying to change
places with me right now.
PUPKIN
Come on.
We shouldn't be here.
RITA
Relax, will you. Let me have a

RITA gets off the bed and runs into the john.

PUPKIN enters the large, beautifully done bathroom.
RITA
examines her face in the mirror.
PUPKIN
(urgently)
Let's go, Rita.
RITA
Boy, I really need some sun.
PUPKIN
Rita, this is Jerry's ...
RITA
Lay off, will you, Rupert.
PUPKIN
But we have no right ...
RITA picks up a can of shave cream and squirts a large
dollop in PUPKIN's face. WE COME IN for a CLOSE UP of
PUPKIN's face, buried under shaving cream.
PUPKIN
That wasn't funny, Rita.
RITA hands him a towel.
RITA
Here.
She looks around.
RITA
Now for something that smells nice.
She swings open the cabinet with a flourish. The door
swings open violently and the mirror shatters against
something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink.
PUPKIN and RITA stand there, staring at each other. RITA
begins to laugh, but her laugh is cut short by the slam of
the downstairs door.

THE FOYER
LANGFORD has entered, drawn and businesslike.
JONNO and
the COOK have moved out to greet him.
LANGFORD
(looking around)
Where are they?
JONNO
I was going to call the police but
then I thought to myself 'what if
they are Mr. Langford's friends?'
We hear some whispers and scuffling at the top of the
stairs. LANGFORD, JONNO and the COOK look up. PUPKIN
comes bounding down the stairs jauntily with RITA following
cautiously behind. PUPKIN has large traces of shaving
cream behind his ears and on his neck.
PUPKIN
Hi, Jerry.
We were just freshening up.
PUPKIN stops at the base of the stairs, turns around, and
waves RITA down.
PUPKIN
(to RITA)
Come on, Rita. No need to be shy.
PUPKIN smiles conspiratorially at LANGFORD.
RITA comes
slowly down.
PUPKIN
Jerry, I'd like you to meet Rita
Keane. Rita, say hello to Jerry!
RITA
(tentatively)
Pleased to meet you.
LANGFORD nods imperceptibly, his face tense, his eyes
alert. RITA, reading her frigid reception, looks to
PUPKIN who walks blithely past LANGFORD into the living
room, toward the bar.
PUPKIN
What's your pleasure?
PUPKIN glances at the small mess he has left on the bar and
turns back to LANGFORD who has moved into the living room
with JONNO and the COOK a few steps behind. PUPKIN flashes
LANGFORD an apologetic smile.
PUPKIN
(to LANGFORD)
We've already taken the liberty, so
to speak. Rita was a little nervous.
It isn't every day she meets someone
like you.
LANGFORD
What's going on here?
PUPKIN
We've been sitting around, waiting.
That's all. How was your golf game?
JONNO
I told them you weren't here.
COOK
That's right.
PUPKIN
He did, Jerry. He was very helpful.
We had to take an early train. There
was nothing else until after one.
(pause) I brought the material.
It's upstairs, in my bags. (pause)
Where is everybody?
LANGFORD
Who?
PUPKIN
The other guests! (in a confidential
tone) We're getting a little hungry,
to tell you the truth.
LANGFORD
(as though confirming
what PUPKIN said)
You are.
PUPKIN
(backing off)
But we don't mind waiting, do we,
Rita?
RITA says nothing. She has sensed something terribly
wrong and is slowly backing away from PUPKIN.
LANGFORD
You know, I could have you arrested,
both of you.
PUPKIN
(seizing the idea)
You know you could! And there'd be
absolutely no way we could prove we
belonged here. I never thought of that.
LANGFORD
Well, you should have before you ...
PUPKIN
(still fixed on the idea)
Maybe we could work up a routine
about that, about a guy who throws
all his friends in jail. Let's talk
about that.
LANGFORD
(sharply)
Let's not.
PUPKIN
Sure, Jerry. Whatever you ...
LANGFORD
(exasperated)
Look, if you've got something for
me to sign, let's have it and get
it over with so I can get back ...
PUPKIN
(interrupting)
That wouldn't be right, Jerry.
Not in your own house!
LANGFORD
(summoning his last
bit of patience)
I have a lot of work to get to.
(to JONNO) How did they get here?
PUPKIN
We took a taxi, Jerry ... But don't
worry about us. You go ahead and
do your work and we'll just take a
stroll around until lunch is ready.
LANGFORD
You're a little thick, aren't you?
PUPKIN
(smiling as though complimented)
Well, maybe a ...
RITA
What's he's saying, Rupert, is that he
wants us out.
PUPKIN
Don't listen to her, Jerry. She
doesn't understand anything about us.
RITA
Don't get me into this.
LANGFORD
(to JONNO)
Call the station.
JONNO goes back into the foyer, followed by the COOK.
LANGFORD
There'll be a cab here in a few
minutes. Now if you'll just wait
at the gate ...
PUPKIN
Look, Jerry, if I've said anything
out of line, let's chalk it up to
inexperience, okay? I'll just go
upstairs and get my tape and we can
start working. It shouldn't take
long and then you'll have the rest of
the afternoon to yourself.
LANGFORD
I've told you just as clearly as I
can. I want you out of here and I
want you out now. Scram, beat it,
vamoose, out! Is that plain enough!
RITA deftly pockets the enamel box.
PUPKIN
But what about my material?
When
are we going to go over it?
RITA
Come on, Rupert, the man wants us
to go.
PUPKIN
Tell her she's wrong, Jerry!
RITA
Look, Mr. Langford. I didn't know
anything about all this. I hardly
know this guy. I haven't seen him
in years.
PUPKIN
Rita!
RITA
So if there's anything I can do, any
way I can make this up to you.
PUPKIN
She's nothing, Jerry. She's just
some girl who works in a bar.
Don't let her spoil things.
LANGFORD starts herding RITA and PUPKIN towards the door.
LANGFORD
Come on.
Let's go.
PUPKIN
All I'm asking is fifteen minutes.
That's all. Just long enough to
listen to my act. Is that asking
too much -- fifteen minutes of your
day against my whole life?
LANGFORD
I'll call the police if I have to.
LANGFORD realizes he is being hard.
He stops for a moment.
LANGFORD
I have my own life, that's all.
PUPKIN
But what about me, Jerry? What about
my life? I made plans -- based on
what you said. You can't just turn
your back on me.
LANGFORD
I'm not telling you again.
There is a long pause as the truth finally sinks in. PUPKIN
just stares at LANGFORD with disbelief that turns to anger.
PUPKIN
So this is the way it
works when
you're big, huh? You
just play with
people. Is that part
of the kick,
Jerry? (pause) I can
see I was all
wrong about you. All
wrong.
RITA starts tugging at PUPKIN.
RITA
Come on, Rupert.
PUPKIN
(to RITA)
Shut up! (to LANGFORD) You weren't
my friend at all, were you? You were
just playing some kind of game with me.
Well, that's not going to stop me,
Jerry. I'm just going to work a
little bit harder, that's all, use a
little bit more enterprise. And not
count on anybody. That's where I
made my mistake. I can see that now.
PUPKIN picks up the pair of small suitcases.
PUPKIN

Come on, Rita. We're wasting our time.

She casts LANGFORD
an apologetic glance as she goes. The
door slams behind
them. They walk down the path silently
for a few moments
as the CAMERA PULLS UP, following them
in an OVERHEAD SHOT.
We hear them start talking as they make
their way towards
the gate.
RITA
(baffled and angry)
What did you think was going to
happen? You think he'd just ... ?
What's the matter with you? (pause)
You can't just walk into a guy's
house! And what about me? What

How much longer?!?
PUPKIN
Do you want him or not?
There is a pause.
MARSHA
You sure he's in there?
PUPKIN
Certain.
MARSHA

My parents are going to be furious!
PUPKIN pulls a toy revolver from his jacket pocket and looks
it over. MARSHA glances at it.
MARSHA
It looks real.
PUPKIN
That's the whole point. (gesturing
with his head towards the entrance
of the building which is some 50 yards
away) Pay attention.
MARSHA looks towards the entrance.
A few beats pass.
MARSHA
What if he doesn't come down?
PUPKIN
He will.
MARSHA
But what if he doesn't?
PUPKIN
We'll come back tomorrow.
MARSHA
And wait again?

Look, you're going to have him all
to yourself. What else do you want?
A MAN resembling LANGFORD walks out the entrance.
PUPKIN
Is that him?!?
MARSHA
No.
PUPKIN
You sure?
MARSHA
Sure I'm sure. That looks too much
like him.
PUPKIN
What do you mean?
MARSHA
When it's him it doesn't look like him.
PUPKIN
Keep watching.
PUPKIN closes his eyes and rests for a moment.
MARSHA
That's him.
PUPKIN's eyes snap open. WE SEE LANGFORD, concealed in his
trench coat, dark glasses and tightly pulled cap start walking

LANGFORD looks at PUPKIN in terror.
He falters a bit, out
of fear.
PUPKIN
I said keep walking. This is a gun
in my pocket and I've got nothing
to lose.
LANGFORD

What do you want?

Just keep walking and don't talk

A MAN
coming the other way stops and stares at LANGFORD
out of
curiosity. PUPKIN and LANGFORD keep walking. They

in the

on the apartment in two ways: First, the place is abso-
lutely chaotic. Secondly, there are a number of blow-up
pictures on the wall. A picture of LANGFORD sits on the
bureau. There is a big brass bed with an ornate brass
frame at the foot. LANGFORD stares at MARSHA and PUPKIN.
PUPKIN closes the blinds and turns on the lights. MARSHA
trains the gun on LANGFORD. PUPKIN finishes his work and
takes the gun back.
PUPKIN
I didn't like being so rough out
there, Jerry. But I wanted you to
know that I meant business. I didn't
want anything happening to you over
some misunderstanding.
LANGFORD just stares at him, frozen with fear.
PUPKIN
Now I know you're wondering
what
this is all about. Actually
you've
got nothing to worry about.
You
just do what I tell you and
by, say,
midnight, you'll be safe and

clever, I'll kill you -- or

will. She knows how to use

Give me a little

PUPKIN looks over to a small phone table with a chair next

Sit down.
LANGFORD docilely sits by the phone.

MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY
LANGFORD is seated on a chair whose back is pressed right
up against the high, ornate brass bedstead at the foot of
the bed. MARSHA trains the gun on LANGFORD now. PUPKIN
is unpacking a suitcase. He takes out a handsome blue suit,
ruffled shirt, a bow tie, black shoes, underwear, socks,
shaving equipment, soap, a hairbrush, a clothesbrush, a
small shoe shine kit, aftershave lotion, deodorant and a
dozen or so rolls of inch-and-a-half wide adhesive tape.
He removes this stuff from a suitcase that is barely big
enough to hold it -- so the mere packing of all this para-
phernalia into such a small space represents something of an
achievement. As he takes the stuff out, he talks to
LANGFORD, his back turned to him.
PUPKIN
This wasn't an easy decision for
me, Jerry, believe me. For one
thing, I knew it meant we could never
be friends again and that hurt me.
It's hard to lose a friend, even one
who has let you down. You always
hope you can patch things up. You
know, a guy like me doesn't make
friends that easily.
PUPKIN pauses a moment, then turns to LANGFORD, his voice
filled with emotion.
PUPKIN
Why didn't you just listen to the
tape when I asked you? Then I
wouldn't have to be doing all this.
Was it really too much to expect --
a few minutes of your time to listen
to something I'd worked on my whole
life?
LANGFORD's eyes shift rapidly.
He is obviously calculating
how to deal with PUPKIN.
LANGFORD
(with disarming charm)
Hey, if that's what's bothering you,
let's go over to my office and listen
to that tape right now.
PUPKIN
Are you crazy, Jerry? Do you know
what would happen to me?
MARSHA listens to this exchange a bit nervously.
Gesturing
to her gun, she says:
MARSHA
Am I going to have to hold this
thing all day?
PUPKIN sees she has lowered it practically to her side.
PUPKIN
(to MARSHA)
Just keep it on him. (to LANGFORD)
You know, Jerry. Friendship is a two-
way street. All that time I was
worrying about you and your ratings
and everything, you couldn't have
cared less about me.
LANGFORD thinks rapidly for a beat or two.
LANGFORD
You're right. You know that? I
was thoughtless. It's just that
when you're doing a big show, it's
hard to tell who your friends really
are. I was wrong. I apologize.
Why don't we just shake hands and
forget the whole thing?
PUPKIN
(suspiciously)
That's easy to say, Jerry.
LANGFORD
But I mean it. I'll tell
them that
the whole thing was a joke
and then
we can go to my office and
listen to
that tape. Come on. What
do you say?
LANGFORD rises with his hand extended toward PUPKIN.
MARSHA
(to LANGFORD, sharply)
Sit down!
LANGFORD looks to PUPKIN.
MARSHA
I said sit!
LANGFORD reluctantly sits down.
PUPKIN
(to MARSHA)
What's the matter?
You heard
what he said.
MARSHA
All of a sudden, with a gun on him,
he wants to make up and be friends.
And, once he's out the door, what
happens then?
PUPKIN
What happens then, Jerry?
MARSHA
You get to his office and they
jump you, that's what happens, Rupert.
PUPKIN
She's right, Jerry.
LANGFORD
Not if I tell them not to. This is
Jerry, Rupert, I give you my word.
PUPKIN
(to MARSHA)
He gives me his word.
MARSHA
Yeah? And what else? Come on,
Rupert, I'm sick of waiting.
PUPKIN
And what else, Jerry?
LANGFORD
Come on, Rupert. My word's good
enough, isn't it.
PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a few beats. Then he shakes
his head sadly and says in a very quiet, discouraged voice.
PUPKIN
No, Jerry. It's not. (to MARSHA)
Keep the gun up!
PUPKIN comes over to LANGFORD with a few rolls of adhesive
tape in his hand.
PUPKIN
I'm sorry to do it this way, Jerry,
but I'm no good at knots. Just put
your arms up and out, okay?
LANGFORD spreads his arms back against the brass bedstead.
As PUPKIN goes to tape them, LANGFORD tries to grab him,
but, with sudden, demonic force, PUPKIN pins him against
the bedstead. They are practically nose to nose.
PUPKIN
Oh, no, Jerry. None of that.

We are in the office of WILSON CROCKETT, president of the

desk, facing a group which includes several other NETWORK
EXECUTIVES, BERT THOMAS, CATHY LONG, F.B.I. INSPECTOR
PATTEN, and his assistant, GIARDELLO.
They are in the
midst of debate.
PATTEN
Look, I tell you, the bureau is doing
everything possible to locate Mr.
Langford. Right now our men are out
checking out every radical group in
this city.
AN EXECUTIVE
Radical?
PATTEN
They're willing to sacrifice their
leader in order to get their message
across, aren't they? You've got to
figure that this is a desperate outfit.
I don't know who they are anymore than
you do. But I do know I've got to
stop them. Otherwise, what you're
seeing here is just the first of a
whole wave of these kinds of kidnappings.
THOMAS
(upset)
Does this mean we're not supposed to
put him on?!?
PATTEN
Who am I addressing, please?
CROCKETT
That's Bert Thomas. He produces the
show.
PATTEN
I'm only saying, Mr. Thomas, that we
can't allow this to reach the public.
When the kidnappers call in, of course
you're going to be cooperative.
Promise them anything they want.
After all, this King character is
going to have to show up sooner or
later. And once we get our hands
on him, he'll tell us where Mr. Langford
is.
PATTEN grinds his fist into his palm.

Sure. Let him go on if you have

you? (pause) All I'm saying is this:
don't put him on the air.
THOMAS
That's fine, Inspector, but let's say
he finishes his bit and you've worked
him over ...
PATTEN
Questioned him, Mr. Thomas.
There is light laughter.
THOMAS
Okay, questioned him and he still
won't talk. We get to eleven thirty
and what do we do? Do we air him or
what?
There is a heavy pause.
PATTEN
I would say no.
THOMAS
But they might kill Jerry!
CROCKETT
(breaking in)
Okay, Burt. (to PATTEN) Thank you,
Inspector. We appreciate your position
and we'll do all we can to cooperate
with you.
But I have to tell you
right now that, if it comes down to
it, we're not taking any chances with
Mr. Langford's life.
PATTEN
I understand but ...
CROCKETT

If your men haven't been able to
locate Mr. Langford by air time,

LANGFORD mumbles incoherently through his gag and tape.
MARSHA
Good. Tell me if you're not.
I guess you're wondering why I do
stuff like this. I think it's
because I'm a Leo, but my shrink says
I'm pathologically rebellious and
self-destructive. You don't think
I'm self-destructive, do you?
LANGFORD, mummified, again mumbles and struggles a bit in

McCabe. The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.
CROCKETT
He's out.
CATHY LONG
What if we don't run this King guy?
Who'll fill the time?
CROCKETT
We'll stretch the other guests. But
I think we're going to wind up running
him. For one thing, we've got to think
about Jerry.
FIRST EXECUTIVE
And from a news point of view, we've
got a responsibility to air this story.
CROCKETT
Exactly, Lou. (pause) I mean, who
would you rather watch -- some tiger
expert or a live kidnapper.
A SECOND EXECUTIVE
But nobody's going to know he's a
kidnapper. They'll think we've gone
crazy.
CROCKETT
Then they'll read about it in the papers
tomorrow and, believe me, tomorrow night,
everyone in America will be watching
Jerry talk about his experience. And
he can put this King guy on rerun.
THOMAS
You're going to put him on twice?
A THIRD EXECUTIVE
What if his stuff's unusable?
SECOND EXECUTIVE
And remember what Patten said about ...
CROCKETT
Hold on. (pause) We can always edit

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you. Thank you very much. I
have some sad news for you. Earlier

in Central Park by the network firing
squad so there'll be no sensational
Randall monologue this evening.

we're going to do something a little
bit different this evening -- a lot
different if you ask me. We're going

It isn't often that you can call
someone a sure thing in the entertainment

always in your hands. But I think
tonight, after you've met my first

is more confident, comfortable and self-assured than we
have ever seen him.
PUPKIN
Good evening, ladies and gentleman.
Let me introduce myself. My name is
Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton,
New Jersey, which was not, at that
time, a federal offense. (laughter)
Is there anyone here from Clifton?
(silence) Good. We can all relax.
Now, I'd like to begin by saying that
my parents were too poor to afford me
a childhood but the fact is nobody is
allowed to be really poor in Clifton.
Once you fall below eleven thousand
you're exiled to Passaic. My parents
did, in fact, put down the first two
payments on my childhood. Then they
tried to return me to the hospital
as defective.
But, like everyone else
I grew up in large part thanks to my
mother. If she was only here today
I'd say, "Hey, mom. What are you
doing here? You've been dead for
nine years?" (laughter) You should
have seen my mother. She was wonderful
-- blonde, beautiful, intelligent,
alcoholic. (laughter) We used to
drink milk together after school.
Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded.
(laughter) Once she was picked up for
speeding. They clocked her doing fifty
-- in our garage. (laughter) When
they tested her they found that her
alcohol was two per cent blood. They
took away her license and she died
shortly afterwards. We used to joke
together Mom and me, until the tears
would stream down her face and she'd
throw up. (laughter) And who would
clean it up? Not Dad. He was too
busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on
his own. In fact, until I was sixteen,
I thought throwing up was a sign of
maturity. While the other kids were
off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I
was hiding behind the house with my
fingers down my throat. (laughter)
I never got anywhere until one day,
my father caught me. Just as he was
giving me a final kick in the stomach,
for luck, I managed to heave all
over his new shoes. "That's it,"
I thought. "I've made it. I'm
finally a man!" (laughter) As it
turned out, that was the only time my
father ever paid any real attention
to me. He was usually too busy out
in the park playing ball with my
sister, Rose. And, today thanks to
those many hours of practice, my
sister Rose has grown into a fine man.
(laughter) Me, I wasn't especially
interested in athletics. The only
exercise I ever got was when the
other kids picked on me. They used
to beat me up once a week, usually
Tuesday. After a while, the school
worked it into the curriculum. And,
if you knocked me out, you got extra
credit. (laughter) Except there was
this one kid who was afraid of me. I
kept telling him, "Hit me! Hit me!
What's the matter with you? Don't you
want graduate?" As for me, I was
the only kid in the history of the
school to graduate in traction. The
school nurse tucked my diploma into
my sling. But my only real interest,
right from the beginning, was show
business. Even as a young man, I
began at the very top, collecting
autographs. (laughter)

but that's the only way I could break
into show business -- by hijacking
Jerry Langford. (laughter) I'm
not kidding. Right now, Jerry
Langford is strapped to a bedstead
somewhere in the middle of this city.
(laughter) Go ahead. Laugh. But
the fact is ... I'm here. Tomorrow
you'll know I wasn't kidding and
you'll think I was crazy. But I
figured it this way: better to be
King for a Night than Schmuck for
a Lifetime!!! (laughter) Good

We hear the sound of tape ripping.
LANGFORD
Ow!

I'm sorry.

PATTEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
PUPKIN is hustled before PATTEN again.
A PLAINCLOTHESMAN
Still nothing.
PUPKIN glances at the clock.
It is 11:05.
PUPKIN
I've got to get out of here.
PATTEN
You're not going anywhere, Pupkin.
Now, where is he?
PUPKIN
I'm telling you, Inspector,
if I don't
see that show where I
want to see it,
Jerry Langford is dead. My
people
have instructions to execute
him
unless they hear from me by
midnight.
PATTEN glances apprehensively at GIARDELLO.
PATTEN
Just where is it you want to watch
this show?

MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
LANGFORD is half unwrapped now. The place is covered with
yard after yard of tape.
MARSHA is working frantically to
finish unwrapping LANGFORD who is helping now that his arms
are free.
LANGFORD
Ow!
God damnit! Not so fast!
MARSHA
(working frantically)
We haven't all night, baby.
MARSHA rips the tape off LANGFORD.
LANGFORD
OW!!!!
MARSHA
Oh, I love you, baby.
I love you
so much.

A limo drives down Broadway, followed by an unmarked car.

INT:
THE LIMO - NIGHT
PATTEN and GIARDELLO sit up front, with the DRIVER. PUPKIN
sits in the back between two PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The limo
pulls up in front of the bar-restaurant where RITA works.
PATTEN turns around in the front seat to address PUPKIN.
PATTEN
Here we, are, Pupkin. I don't know
what this is all about, but as soon
as you've seen yourself, you're going
to talk to us or I promise you,
you'll never see daylight again.
PUPKIN
I'll need a couple of minutes, Inspector.
PATTEN
What?!?
PUPKIN
After it's over, I want a couple of
minutes. And I'll need ten dollars.
Does anyone of you gentlemen have my
wallet?
PATTEN
Don't push me, Pupkin.
PUPKIN
A condemned man's last request,
Inspector.
PATTEN
Well, I'll tell you right away, the
answer is no, Pupkin.
PUPKIN
It's not much of a ransom, Inspector ...
PATTEN
(losing his temper)
Look, I'm drawing the line, that's
all! No ten dollars and that's it.
(emphatically) No -- ten -- dollars!!!!
You understand?!?
PUPKIN
(in mollifying tones)
Sure. Sure, Inspector. No ten dollars ...
PATTEN
(appeased)
Okay.
PUPKIN
... and no Jerry Langford.
There is a pause as PATTEN stifles himself.
PUPKIN
Come on, it's getting late, Inspector.
PATTEN
(exploding to
one of his MEN)
Go ahead. Give him
his goddamned ten
dollars! Give him
twenty! I don't
care. Just get him
out of here!
One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN in the back opens the door and
PUPKIN and the other PLAINCLOTHESMAN get out. The unmarked
car has pulled up behind the limo and other PLAINCLOTHESMEN
stand next to it. PUPKIN and the two PLAINCLOTHESMEN start
walking the ten yards or so to the bar-restaurant.

144
INT:
THE BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHT
PUPKIN marches in flanked by the PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The
clock over the bar reads 11:30. RITA looks up from talking
with a CUSTOMER and sees PUPKIN. She says nothing. She
just looks at him. There are five CUSTOMERS at the bar. A
working class COUPLE in their late fifties are half-stewed,
the man telling the woman that her friend, Maud, isn't
really her friend because she wants $150 for a used
refrigerator. A few seats down, two MEN in their mid-
forties, in wind-breakers are locked in an intense but
inaudible conversation. And, close to the television set
which hangs over the far end of the bar sits a MOUSY MAN
with glasses, who looks like an accountant. He is sipping
a beer, his eyes fixed on the set where the CBS late movie
is just showing its logo. PUPKIN marches up to the bar.
PUPKIN
(urgently to RITA)
Turn on Langford. Seven.
MOUSY MAN
Hey!
I'm watching this.
RITA keeps staring at PUPKIN.
PUPKIN
Just turn it. Come on.
MOUSY MAN
I was here first, mister. You can't
just walk in like this. It isn't
fair.
RITA glances at the MAN. PUPKIN can't
wait. He vaults
onto the bar and turns the set to the
Langford Show, just
as, on screen, he walks from the wings
onto the stage to
the applause of the studio audience.
Perched atop the bar,
standing next to the image of himself,
PUPKIN looks down at
RITA, a smile of pride and triumph on
his face.

MONTAGE -- NIGHT
PUPKIN walking onto television screens in various homes
across America -- in a chic New York living room, in a
suburban bedroom, in the parlor of an Indiana farmhouse,
in a kitchen where a COUPLE is in the middle of a raging
domestic quarrel, in an otherwise dark bedroom where a
COUPLE is in the throes of lovemaking, in a bar, a station
house, in a television store window display.

INT:
MARSHA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
MARSHA has just removed her dress and stands in
her bra and
panties as LANGFORD unwraps the last tape from
about his
ankles. The room is swimming in tape, like an
enormous
boa constrictor gone mad. MARSHA moves towards
LANGFORD,
her arms open.
MARSHA
Oh, baby.
Baby.
LANGFORD frees his ankles of tape just in time to side-step
MARSHA and moves quickly to the dining room table where he
grabs the gun. He trains it on her.
LANGFORD
Stop!
MARSHA moves toward him. He pulls the trigger, releasing
a plastic pellet that hits MARSHA in the stomach, stinging her.
MARSHA
Ow!
LANGFORD glances down in horror at the gun which he now
realizes is a toy and looks up in horror to see MARSHA,
bigger than life, bearing down on him.
MARSHA
Don't be afraid of Marsha, baby.

INT:
BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The CUSTOMERS are watching the conclusion of Pupkin's
monologue, along with the PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN. WE
COME IN a split second after a joke. The CUSTOMERS laugh,
with the exception of the MOUSY MAN who is waiting, in bad
humor, for Pupkin's act to finish. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN
laugh reluctantly. PUPKIN, no longer standing on the bar,
but back down with the others, watches with fascination.
RITA watches grimly, occasionally glancing at PUPKIN.
PUPKIN on TV
But I figured it this way: better to
be King for a Night than Schmuck for
a Lifetime. (audience and CUSTOMERS
laugh)
Good night, ladies and
gentlemen, and God bless you.
The television audience applauds and the CUSTOMERS applaud
and cheer in good humor except for the MOUSY MAN. The
HALF-STEWED MAN leans across his WOMAN to yell at PUPKIN
as the two FRIENDS in windbreakers congratulate PUPKIN at
the same time. There is a brief moment of carnival
excitement.
HALF-STEWED MAN
FIRST FRIEND
Hey, that's pretty good.
(to PUPKIN)
Schmuck for a Lifetime!
How do you think up all
(to the WOMAN) You know
that stuff?
who he's talkin' about?
Your brother!

It's a trick, that's

HALF-STEWED MAN
MOUSY MAN
What about him?
Is it over now?
HALF-STEWED WOMAN
FIRST FRIEND
He's another one.
He's funnier than Larry.
Larry just makes a lot

I told you to shut up about

Well, if nobody

minds ...
PUPKIN takes all this praise and excitement with a shy
smile of satisfaction, glancing at RITA from time to time
for her reaction. She merely stares at PUPKIN with a sad
expression on her face.
PUPKIN
Come on, Rita. Don't spoil the party.
(to the CUSTOMERS) Drinks all around
on me.
HALF-STEWED MAN
(in a loud voice, to HALF-
STEWED WOMAN)
What about the hundred and fifty?
We never saw a penny outta your
brother.
HALF-STEWED WOMAN
That's because my brother is a family
man, not like Phil.
The argument between the HALF-STEWED MAN and his WOMAN
continues at the end of the bar. The two FRIENDS have
resumed their intense conversation.
PUPKIN
(to the two FRIENDS)
What'll you have?
FIRST FRIEND
I'm okay.
Thanks, pal.
SECOND FRIEND
Me, too.
The MOUSY MAN has climbed up on the bar and has turned the
TV back to the late movie. He sits enthralled by a scene
of violence courtesy of Tony Curtis as the Boston
Strangler. PUPKIN looks down the bar at the STEWED COUPLE
to offer them drinks, but they are lost in an argument
over the relative merits of their brothers. PUPKIN turns
to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN.
PUPKIN
I don't suppose you're allowed anything.
(to RITA) I guess nobody's in a
celebrating mood. How about you?
You want something?
FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN
It's getting time, Pupkin.
PUPKIN
In a second.
RITA
(in a sad, serious voice
to PUPKIN)
That was true, wasn't it? ... about
the kidnapping.
PUPKIN nods and shrugs.
PUPKIN
Now you can say you knew me.
That's
something, anyway.
FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN
Come on, Pupkin.
PUPKIN
(to RITA, in a quiet,
tender voice)
I guess I've got go. Take care of
yourself, will you. And when you're
bored -- you know, when you're brushing
your teeth or something, give me a
thought, okay?
RITA
Okay.
The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN out of the bar. The two
FRIENDS are still buried in their intense, private
conversation. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN walk past
the HALF-STEWED COUPLE.
HALF-STEWED WOMAN
It's okay to talk about my sister,
but we can't say nuthin' about Phil,
is that it?
HALF-STEWED MAN
(to PUPKIN)
She's just had one too many.
The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN onto the street.

EXT:
THE BAR - NIGHT
As they walk the few steps to the car, the FIRST
PLAINCLOTHESMAN turns to PUPKIN.
FIRST
PLAINCLOTHESMAN
I just don't get
it, Pupkin. You're
gonna spend eight
years in the can --
"minimum" -- and
for what?
SECOND PLAINCLOTHESMAN
Yeah, Pupkin. You threw it all away.
PUPKIN

We'll see.
WE CLOSE IN on PUPKIN, smiling.

THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW STUDIO - NIGHT
The STAGE MANAGER is counting down. At zero, he points to
RICK ROSS who launches the orchestra into the Langford Show
theme song. BERT CANTER, standing stage right, speaks into
the mike.
CANTER
And now! Direct from New York!
The Jerry Langford Show, starring
Jerry's special guest, out on bail,
Rupert Pupkin, the kidnapping King
of Comedy!!!!
The AUDIENCE applauds mightily and the FINAL CREDITS roll.
As they roll, the music to the Langford Show continues and
WE WATCH a MONTAGE that shows PUPKIN progressively taping
LANGFORD to the back of a brass bedstead on stage as the
two of them talk and laugh. By the end of the MONTAGE,
LANGFORD is once again mummified and PUPKIN, having
finished, bows and smiles. WE CLOSE on a FREEZE-FRAME
CLOSE UP of PUPKIN in ecstasy.
FADE OUT.
