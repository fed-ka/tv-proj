      Will pours a CUP OF COFFEE as his wife THERESA HAYDEN KEEN
      (30's playful, supermom/wife) sorts through the MAIL in the
      kitchen.  Her LAPTOP is open on the counter. Lucy eats a
      BOWL OF CEREAL and plays with a MERMAID DOLL.  Theresa holds
    up a PACKAGE to Will.

                                      THERESA
                    Can you open this for me?

                                    WILL
                    This is a job for...

      Will takes out a SMALL POCKET KNIFE.  Lucy GIGGLES.

                                    LUCY
                    The Old Mohaska!

      Will smiles as he cuts the package open.

                                      THERESA
                    Where is Nathan?

                                    LUCY
                    He's trapped in the bathroom because
                    he saw a spider. 

      Will opens the package, it's a VIDEO GAME.                                                                                        7.

                                    WILL
                    Dead Space 2!  Awesome! Thanks, Hon. 

                                      THERESA
                          (Laughing)
                    It's not for you.  It's a birthday
                    present for Nathan. 

                                    WILL
                    Okay, see?  This is a great gift. 
                    It's violent, it's scary, it's not
                    for kids.  This would have been a
                    great gift for me to give him.

                                      THERESA
                    So, we'll put both of our names on
                    it.  I don't care.

                                    WILL
                    Theresa, you don't understand.  I'm
                    his father.  I've got to give him
                    something that will prepare him for
                    manhood.

                                      THERESA
                    You're over-thinking this.

      Will looks into the fridge.

                                    WILL
                    We need more Hazelnut creamer.  And
                    next time get the non-dairy stuff.   

                                      THERESA
                    Did your father give you something
                    special when you turned 13?  Is that
                    what this is about?

                                    WILL
                    Are you kidding me?  My father didn't
                    even know it was my birthday!  He
                    didn't get off the couch.  He didn't
                    even put on pants. 

      Theresa giggles. 

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    I've got to give Nathan something
                    that signifies his entry into manhood. 
                    I don't expect you to understand it. 
                    You're a woman.  I'm a man.  

                                      THERESA
                    Oh, please, Will.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        8.

                    Your grandfather fought in World War
                    Two.  Your father fought in Vietnam. 
                    You play Call of Duty on Playstation
                    3 and drink non-dairy Hazelnut
                    creamer.  

                                    WILL
                    Are you saying I'm not a man?

                                      THERESA
                    I'm saying that the whole "real man"
                    thing died out a generation ago.

                                    WILL
                    Is this about my pomegranate body
                    wash?

      Theresa giggles.

                                      THERESA
                    It's not a bad thing!  It's a good
                    thing.  You're evolved.  You're
                      socialized. You're sensitive.  

      She kisses him and sits at her COMPUTER. 

                                      THERESA (CONT'D)
                    It's why I married you.

                                    WILL
                    Let me tell you something.  You really
                    don't know me.  Because I protect
                    you from the violent, primal beast
                    that lurks deep within.  

                                      THERESA
                    You mean the primal beast that cries
                    during Grey's Anatomy?

                                    WILL
                    That's the one!  Izzie was very brave
                    battling that cancer.  

      NATHAN KEEN (13, dorky) enters holding the CORDLESS PHONE. 

                                      NATHAN
                    Dad!  Samantha just called and said
                    she is coming to my party tomorrow. 
                    This girl is a firecracker.  What do
                    I do?

                                    WILL
                    Try to get her in the bounce house.                                                                                        9.

                                      THERESA
                          (Appalled)
                    Will!!

                                    WILL
                    It wasn't a euphemism, T.  I was
                    being literal.

                                      THERESA
                          (Embarrassed)
                    Oh.

                                    WILL
                    A bounce house is like a twelve year-
                    old's bachelor pad.  She'll be putty
                    in your hands.

                                      NATHAN
                    Got it!

      Theresa sees something on the COMPUTER that jars her. 

                                      THERESA
                    Nathan! Did you just defriend me on
                    Facebook?

                                      NATHAN
                    Well, you update your status too
                    much and it's embarrassing. 

                                      THERESA
                    No, it's not. 

                                      NATHAN
                    "Nathan's turning thirteen.  Mommy's
                    little baby boy all growed up! Waaah!"

                                      THERESA
                    That's not embarrassing.  It's sweet.

                                      NATHAN
                    Dad?

                                    WILL
                    It's very embarrassing, T.  

      Theresa crosses to her son, holds his face in her hands. 

                                      THERESA
                    Well, I'm sorry that I love you. It
                    makes me sad that you're growing up. 
                          (Kisses him)
                    Now, go refriend me or you're
                    grounded.                                                                                         10.

      Nathan sighs.

                                    LUCY
                    Nathan, daddy is gonna get you a
                    special birthday gift.

                                      NATHAN
                    Really, Dad?

                                    WILL
                    You bet.  You're becoming a man. A
                    real man!  Just like your Dad.   

      Will and Nathan do a CHOREOGRAPHED HANDSHAKE: A series of
      fist bumps that ends with them about to take a drag on an
      imaginary JOINT, but they simultaneously think better of it. 

                                      NATHAN
                    What is it, Dad?  Give me a hint.

                                    WILL
                    Nope.  It's a surprise.  Nobody knows
                    what it is.  I mean, literally, nobody
                    in this room knows what it is.

      Kenny bursts in through the BACK DOOR.

                                      KENNY
                          (To Theresa)
                    You turn your phone off now?

                                      THERESA
                    I do when you're acting like an idiot. 

                                      KENNY
                    She can't come, T.  We're divorced!  

                                      THERESA
                    She's Nathan's Godmother!

                                      KENNY
                    I'm his Godfather.  That's a higher
                    rank.

                                      THERESA
                    Look, I realize that you guys couldn't
                    work it out, but I've decided that
                    for the sake of the kids you're gonna
                    have to deal with each other like
                    adults.  She's my best friend.

                                      KENNY
                    Well, I'm your brother. I'm putting
                    my foot down.  You hear me?

                                      KENNY (CONT'D)
                    She is not welcome in this house. 
                    Bridgette is no longer a part of
                    this family. 

                                      FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello!

                                    LUCY
                    Aunt Bridgette!

      Lucy gets up and runs to hug BRIDGETTE HAYDEN (30's, pretty,
      lots of energy) entering the kitchen.  Kenny is frustrated.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Hi, everybody.  And Kenny. 

                                      KENNY
                    Bridge, we're gonna have to set some
                      boundaries.  Alright?  I'm sorry,
                    but you can't come to Nathan's party. 

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Theresa invited me.

                                      KENNY
                    Well, I'm uninviting you.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    It doesn't work like that.

                                      KENNY
                    Oh, it doesn't?!  Well, I'm the
                    Godfather!  How about that?

      Will rises and grabs Kenny's arm.

                                    WILL
                    Okay. Time out! Kenny, come with me.

                                      KENNY
                    This is why we're divorced.  You
                    always have to push my buttons!

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    We're divorced because you sold my
                    Kitchen Aid mixer so you could buy a
                      twelve-inch Boba Fett on Ebay!

                                      KENNY
                    It's a collector's item!

      Will drags Kenny out the door.  Bridgette and Theresa hug.                                                                                        12.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Is this gonna be a problem, T?  I
                    don't want to cause trouble. 

                                      THERESA
                    Oh, yeah.  Cause you never want to
                    cause trouble.


      Nathan's party is underway.  Kids run around and jump in and
      out of a BOUNCE HOUSE.  Parents mingle and chat.  Will and
      Theresa carry food from THE GRILL to the PATIO.  

                                      THERESA
                    Tell me!

                                    WILL
                    Nope. It's a surprise. 

                                      THERESA
                    Well, give me a hint. 

                                    WILL
                    All right. It's a hooker.

                    Will!

                                    WILL
                    Let's just say it's the perfect gift
                    for a boy crossing over into manhood. 
                    It's useful, it's exciting and he's
                    gonna think it's very cool.

                                      THERESA
                    It actually sounds like it could be
                    a hooker.

      They laugh as they arrive at the PATIO where Craig stands
      across from Kenny and Bridgette, who is enthralled.

                                      CRAIG
                    Then she started reminiscing about
                    how I used to sing "Brown-Eyed Girl"
                    in her dorm room sophomore year. 

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Oh, my god. I love that song.                                                                                        19.

                                      THERESA
                    Craig, are you still on this?

                                      KENNY
                    He's gonna be "on this" for a while.

                                      CRAIG
                    She's getting married today and I
                    think that secretly she doesn't really
                    want to do it.  That's why she needed
                    to see me.  Now, do you think I should
                    do something?

                                      THERESA
                    No, Craig, I told you.  She's just
                    feeling nostalgic.  That's all. 

                                      BRIDGETTE
                          (Sincere)
                    Oh, I totally disagree.  She wants
                    you to come after her.

                                      CRAIG
                    You think?

      A collective, ad-libbed "No!" from Will, Kenny and Theresa.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Totally! Craig, this girl is your
                    soulmate.  You can't let her get
                    away.  Once you realize someone is
                    your soulmate, it's forever.  

                                      KENNY
                    You said I was your soulmate.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    No, my soulmate is gonna be here any
                    minute and he's bringing Lemon Bars. 

                                      KENNY
                    Oh, so this guy's your soulmate now?

      Bridgette's PHONE BUZZES and she walks off. 

                                      KENNY (CONT'D)
                    Okay, I can't promise that this sweet
                    little birthday party isn't gonna
                    turn into an all out bloodbath!

                                    WILL
                    Hey!  W.W.T.M.D!  Play it cool.  He
                    can't affect you!  You're in charge.                                                                                        20.

                                      KENNY
                    Right.  I'm in charge. 

                                    WILL
                    Besides, when this guy shows up I
                    guarantee he's a full blown loser!

      Bridgette enters the yard with GRANT (30's tall, fit and
      very attractive.)  Will sees him.

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    Or he could be an underwear model. 

      They approach the group with an armload of gifts. 

                                      GRANT
                    Folks, thanks for having me.  Bridge
                    has told me so much about all of you
                    guys.  You must be Theresa.

    He kisses Theresa and hands her LEMON BARS and WINE.

                                      THERESA
                    Grant, you shouldn't have. 

                                      GRANT
                    Momma raised a gentleman.  
                          (To Will)
                    You must be Will.  Man of the house. 

    He shakes his hand and hands him a BOX OF CIGARS.

                                      GRANT (CONT'D)
                    Cohibas.  Illegal.  You didn't get
                    them from me. 

      Grant cracks up.  He greets Craig and tousles Lucy's hair. 
      His eyes land on Kenny and he pauses.

                                      GRANT (CONT'D)
                    You must be Ken.  There's no need
                    for this to be awkward for us.  I
                    want you to know I respect you and
                    everything you had with Bridge.  You
                    guys are connected.  I get that.  If
                    we need to clear the air, hash out
                    what needs hashing, I say let's do
                    it and then grow to be close friends. 

    He extends his hand.  Kenny reluctantly shakes it.

                                      KENNY
                    Whatever.                                                                                         21.

                                      GRANT
                    Sweet.  Now, where's the birthday
                    boy?

      Grant turns to Nathan and hands him a NICELY WRAPPED GIFT.

                                      NATHAN
                    Wow, thanks.  Can I open it, Mom?

                                      THERESA
                    Okay.  But just this one.

      Nathan tears into the gift.

                                      GRANT
                    Thirteen is an important age.  I
                    remember Dad gave me this very gift
                    when I hit that poignant milestone. 
                    Becoming a teenager.  That cross
                    over in to manhood. 

      Nathan reveals the gift.  His face lights up.

                                      NATHAN
                    A shaving kit!  That's awesome. 

                                      GRANT
                          (Laughing)
                    You're gonna need it, soldier. 

      Will's face is frozen in a HORRIFIC SMILE.  It's obvious
      what his secret gift is. 


      The CHURCH DOORS burst open and Will and Kenny drag Craig
      quickly down the steps as the real "Brown-Eyed Girl" plays. 
      They race towards the car.  A moment later the GROOMSMEN
      burst through the door and chase them. 

                                    END OF ACT TWO                                                                                        26.

                                      ACT THREE


      Kenny nurses a beer and watches Grant PLAYING BASKETBALL
      with a group of kids. Bridgette sidles up. 

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    You know, he played in college.

                                      KENNY
                    Yeah, well, I played in High School! 
                    You forget?  They used to call me
                    Tempo cause of my speed.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    They called you Tempo cause you played
                    bass drum in the marching band. 

      Kenny HANDS HER HIS BEER and briskly steps onto the court. 

                                      KENNY
                    Grant!  Little "One on One"?

                                      GRANT
                    Oh, I love a friendly pick-up game.                                                                                        29.

      The kids clear the court as Kenny and Grant square off. 
      They both simultaneously REMOVE THEIR SHIRTS.  Grant is
      incredibly chiseled.  Kenny, not so much.  He immediately
      puts his shirt back on. 

                                      KENNY
                    We'll go shirts and skins.  That way
                    there's no confusion about whose on
                    what team.

      A gaggle of Moms notice Grant's torso and gather around. 
      They check the ball.  Kenny dribbles and stares Grant down. 

                                      KENNY (CONT'D)
                    It's Go time. 

    He brings the ball into play.  Grant immediately steals it
      and does an EFFORTLESS LAY UP.

                                      GRANT
                    Two-zip!  We playing to twenty-one?

      Kenny sighs.  Maybe this wasn't a good idea.


      Grant and Kenny are mid-game.  The crowd cheers as Grant
      SLAMS the basketball and knocks Kenny to the ground. 

                                      GRANT
                    Game point!

      Kenny is wrecked, winded, in agony.  The CAR HORN continues
    to blast.  Kenny looks up.  His eyes go wide.                                                                                        30.


      A BIG BLACK SUV sits in front of the house.  THE GROOMSMEN
      from Lisa's wedding, now drunk, stand on the lawn.

                                      GROOM
                    Bring out the Brown-Eyed Girl!

    He smashes a BEER BOTTLE on the sidewalk. 


      Will exits the house followed by Craig and Grant.  The ENTIRE
      BIRTHDAY party is pressed against every window in the house. 
      The women clutch children to their breast.  Will steps out
      onto the grass.  Craig and Grant stay on the porch.  A tense
      beat of silence passes and you can actually HEAR THE WIND. 
      A NEWSPAPER blows between Will and the Groom. 

                                    WILL
                    What's up?

                                      GROOM
                          (Pointing at Craig)
                    We want him.

      Will looks back at Craig, then back to the Groom. 

                                    WILL
                    You can't have him. 

      Will glances to his right, looking for Kenny.


      The scene is as we left it.                                                                                         32.

                                    WILL
                    You guys don't want to do this. 
                    You're drunk.  You're angry.  You
                    should go home and sleep it off.

      Kenny emerges from the garage and walks down the DRIVEWAY. 
      His face looks stone cold, but he carries a PINK POGO STICK
      with TASSELS on the handlebars.  Will glances over and does
      a small DOUBLE TAKE.  Kenny shrugs: "Best I could do."

                                      GROOM
                    He ruined my wedding!  And we're
                    gonna kick his ass. 

                                    WILL
                    I can't let you do that.

      The Groom looks to his MEN.  Signals them.  They all start
      moving towards Craig on the porch.  Will steps up, Kenny
      moves in from the DRIVEWAY.  It's on.  The tension is cut by
      a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.  All parties turn to see it's source: 
      Grant, still shirtless, barrels off the porch in a MAD RAGE.  

                                      GRANT
                    Barracuda!

    He whips past Will and TACKLES the Groom.  The GROOMSMEN
      descend on him in a savage HOG PILE.  Will and Kenny share a
      look.  "Should we help him out?"
