          CHYRON OVER BLACK: TERRY - THE MOM

          TERRY GANNON, JR., 30 s, beautiful in a tomboy kind of 
        way, moves on to a little league pitcher s mound.  She 
          picks up a BASEBALL and looks around...

          SPECTATORS, young and old, line around the field watching 
          Terry s every move.

                                            TERRY
                              (to self)
                        What in the hell are you doing out 
                        here?  You promised yourself, 
                        you d never let baseball into your 
                        life again.  

          Terry looks to home plate where WE SEE the unbearably 
          cocky DICK SLINGBAUGH, 40, holding a bat and moving into 
        the batter s box.  Dick wiggles his hips, takes a couple 
          practice swings, then...

                                          DICK
                        Alright, pumpkin, I ve seen your 
                        best  bitch,  now let s see your 
                        best pitch.

          Terry eyes Dick then reaches down and deliberately, maybe 
        even in SLOW MOTION, rubs some dirt on her hands.  Terry 
          steps on the rubber and THE CAMERA MOVES IN on the ball 
        as she grips a  four seamer.   She winds up and uncorks a 
          pitch with everything she has.  As the ball rips out of 
        her hand and gets halfway to home plate we FREEZE FRAME, 
          and...



          CHYRON OVER BLACK: THE CANNON - TERRY S FATHER

          TERRY GANNON, SR., 60 s, nicknamed  The Cannon  for his 
          powerful pitching arm as well as his volatile temper, 
          exits his car wielding a BASEBALL BAT.  He makes his way 
        up the driveway of a quaint, single-family home where a 
          PRIUS is parked.

        The Cannon smashes the car s windshield in.  He then 
          starts smashing the side windows.  The Cannon moves to 
        the back window when A MAN rushes out of the house.

                                          MAN
                        Hey!  Stop!  What the hell are you 
                        doing?!




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                      2.

          CONTINUED:

        The Cannon looks at the Man, then smashes the car s back 
          window.

        WE FREEZE FRAME ON THE BACK WINDOW EXPLODING, as we...



          CHYRON OVER BLACK: DANNY - TERRY S SON

          DANNY GANNON, 10, stands in front of a large, menacing 
        boy, DAVID SLINGBAUGH, 11.

          VANESSA TAYLOR, 11, beautiful, stands watching the boys.  

          Danny looks adoringly at Vanessa who smiles at him.  A 
          beat, then Danny grabs David s face and KISSES HIM ON THE 
          LIPS.

        WE FREEZE FRAME ON THEM KISSING, as we...

          CHYRON:  A COUPLE DAYS EARLIER

          A large BANNER proclaims:  LITTLE LEAGUE TRYOUTS TODAY. 

          Terry and Danny walk toward the field. Danny is geared up 
        for his tryout.  THE CANNON follows behind drinking a 
        beer wrapped in a paper bag.  Terry looks around the 
          field, the stands, the people...

                                            TERRY
                        Why are we even here, Danny?  
                        You ve never shown any interest in 
                        baseball before.  Is this your way 
                        of rebelling after the divorce?  

                                            DANNY
                        Yes, I ve chosen America s pastime 
                        to hurt you deeply.
                                (Then)
                        Mom, I m fine and you have to stop 
                        feeling guilty.  Dad was cheating 
                        on you.  Heck, if I could drive, 
                        we would have left months ago. 

                                            TERRY
                        He was cheating on me?!

                                            DANNY
                        You re still very funny.

                                            TERRY
                        So, why baseball...?

          Terry looks toward The Cannon who drinks then burps.

                                            TERRY
                              (re: The Cannon)

                        Whoa! Way to use your words, mom.
                                (Then)
                        No, The Cannon didn t say a word.  
                        You want to know the reason...?

          Danny nods past Terry who looks and SEES the beautiful 
          VANESSA talking to David Slingbaugh in his all-star 
          jacket.

                                            DANNY
                        Her.

                        She will be mine.

                        Don t worry.  You re still my 
                        number one chick.

          Terry gives Danny a hug.  Danny looks at The Cannon.

                                            DANNY
                        And, I know you have problems with 
                        The Cannon, but it ll be OK. 

                                            TERRY
                        I ve already got job interviews

                        Good news, because it smells like 
                          a urinal...

          Terry hands Danny his mitt.  Danny tries to put the mitt 
        on the wrong hand.

        The Cannon rushes up.

                        Hey kid, if they give you a chance 
                        to pitch, throw as hard as you can 
                        and hit the first kid right in the 
                        face.  They'll be scared shitless 
                        of you.

                              (To Danny)
                        No! Do not hit a kid in the face.  
                        We don t do that.  Just go have 
                        fun.  Go...

          Danny runs off.  Terry turns to The Cannon.

                                            TERRY
                        Why the hell would you say that to 
                        him?!

                        One: It s funny.  Two: It worked 
                        for you when you played.  Remember 
                        when you hit that kid in the side 
                        of the head and they had to get 
                        him one of those "giant shoes" 
                        because he could never get his 
                        balance back?  

                                            TERRY
                        Yeah, and every kid in that league 
                        thought I was a lunatic.

                                          THE CANNON
                        And you loved it.  You loved 
                        having that power over them.  
                        That s why you threw that pitch. 

                                            TERRY
                        I was nine, you buffoon!  I threw 
                        that pitch because you said I 
                        could have ice cream and a pony if 
                        I did it.

                                          THE CANNON
                        Hey, you got your ice cream.

                                            TERRY
                        Ice cubes sprinkled with non-dairy 
                        creamer isn t ice cream.

                                          THE CANNON
                        Well, all I remember is you threw 
                        six perfect games that season and 
                        we made it to the championship.

                        And all I remember is you peeing 
                        on home plate in protest after we 
                        won the championship.

                        I told you to throw that game!  I 
                        bet two grand that we would lose!

                        I know.  The guy you bet gave me 
                        five-hundred to win it.
                                (then)
                        I have to go watch Danny now... 
                        Alone.

          Terry exits.  The Cannon guzzles his beer and throws it 
        on the ground.  A BOY moves past him.

                        Hey, mister.  You shouldn t

        The Cannon pulls out his cell phone and aims it.

                                          THE CANNON
                        I ve never seen a kid as ugly as 
                        you before.

        The Cannon takes a picture and the Boy runs off.  The 
          Cannon starts off and passes TWO MOMS...

          Terry sits at the top of the bleachers watching Danny.  A 
          YOUNG GIRL sits to the right of her eating a SNOW CONE.

          ANGLE ON:  Danny warms up with the other BOYS.  Danny can 
          barely throw and can t catch anything. 

          Terry puts her face in her hands, when...

          Terry looks up to SEE GIGI FERNANDEZ-LOVETTE, 30 s, a 
          fashionably fabulous Hispanic beauty sitting on her left.  
        Gigi is offering Terry a FLASK.

                        nerves.  Go ahead, bang one out.

          Terry looks around then grabs the flask and takes a long 
          swig.  She hands the flask back.  Gigi hands Terry a lime 
          wedge.  Terry sucks on the lime, then...

                        Let me hit that Tequila again. 

        Gigi gives Terry the flask.  She takes another swig.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                      8.

        Gigi points to FOUR MEN with clipboards, standing at the 
          bottom of the bleachers, evaluating the kids trying out.

                        him last year for cheating with 
                        four different moms.  Word is he s

          Terry looks out and SEES Danny is at the front of a line 
        of Boys in the outfield.  A COACH hits a fly ball to him.

          ANGLE ON: Danny circles under the ball and as it gets 
          close, he ducks his head and runs away from it.

          ANGLE ON: The Cannon watching Danny.

                                          THE CANNON
                        Geezus, that kid stinks.  

        BACK ON: Danny picks up the ball and throws it back to 
        the Coach.  The ball barely goes ten feet.

                                          THE CANNON
                        Hey, Pinocchio, throw like a real 
                        boy! Boo! Boo!

        The Cannon walks away in disgust.

          ANGLE ON:  Dick with the other coaches.  They laugh at 
          Danny s throw which gets Terry s attention.  Then...

                                            COACH T 
                        Wow... Did that kid go to Stephen

                        come out here and embarrass 
                        himself like that?  The only thing 
                        that kid s ever gonna catch is a 
                        short bus and a beating.

          Terry hears this, turns to the Young Girl sitting on the 
          bleachers, grabs her snow cone and fires it at Dick 
          hitting him hard in the back of the head.

        Dick turns to SEE Terry who now has Gigi standing next to 
        her.  Both Terry and Gigi POINT to the Young Girl.

          Danny is walking at recess.  Other KIDS are doing what 
        kids do at recess.  Danny glances TO HIS RIGHT and BAM! 
        He SEES the beautiful Vanessa. 

                                            DANNY
                        Whoa...

          Vanessa is flirting with THREE BOYS, DAVID SLINGBAUGH 
          (from the Cold Open), 11, BOBBY VANCE, 11, and RYAN

          LITTLE LEAGUE ALL-STAR JACKETS.

        The school BELL RINGS, David gives Vanessa a hug, and the 
          three boys walk off.  As Vanessa grabs her backpack, a 
        book falls out unnoticed by her.  Danny SEES the fallen 
        book and rushes after it.  He picks it up and moves after 
          Vanessa.

                                            DANNY

                        You dropped this.

          Danny hands Vanessa the book.

                                            DANNY

                        The new kid.  I ve seen you 
                        around.  You were at the little

                        You have ridiculously blue eyes.

          Suddenly, from behind, Danny is SHOVED to the ground.  
          Danny looks up and SEES David, Bobby, and Ryan standing 
        over him.  Danny gets up and David moves to him.

                                            DAVID

                        that bullying at our age is linked 
                        to compensating for a small penis?

          Vanessa bursts out laughing.  David grabs Danny by the 
          shirt and gets in his face.

                                            DAVID

                        and there s not a damn thing you 
                        can do about it.

          Danny looks at Vanessa who smiles at him.  A beat, then 
          Danny grabs David s face and KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS.  
          David is frozen.  Bobby and Ryan are shocked.  Vanessa 
          looks at Danny and he WINKS at her.  Vanessa smiles, 
          then... BANG!  David punches Danny in the eye.  

                                            DAVID
                        You stay away from her... And me!  
                        Weirdo...

          David wipes his mouth and he, Ryan, and Bobby exit.  
          Vanessa moves to Danny and helps him up.

          Danny shakes his head and exits.                                                                                    15.



          Terry is in front of guy, JOE, standing by a VAN.  

                                            TERRY
                        Am I in the right place?  I m here 
                        about an advertising job? 

                                          JOE
                        Bitchin.  We need more chicks. 
                        Let s see what you got. 

        Joe throws open the van and pulls out a LARGE SIGN which 
        he twirls and flips and then hands to Terry.  Terry looks 
        at Joe, drops the sign and exits. 



          Terry drives her car up to the drive-thru speaker box.

          Terry s cell rings again.  She grabs it.

        Cars behind Terry start HONKING.  Terry moves the phone 
        away and yells back out the window...

        COLD OPEN)

          Terry on the mound with a baseball in her hand.  WE SEE 
          SPECTATORS, young and old, lined around the baseball 
          field watching Terry.

                                            TERRY
                              (to self)
                        What in the hell are you doing out 
                        here?  You promised yourself, 
                        you d never let baseball into your 
                        life again. 

        Dick moves into the batter s box.

                                          GIGI (O.S.)
                        Let s go Terry!

          Terry looks and SEES Gigi sitting on the bleachers with 
        her son, Michael, next to her.  Michael is wearing 
          earbuds and spelling out the letters,  Y-M-C-A  with his 
          arms.

          David, the boy who punched Danny, stands at the fence 
          behind home plate with Vanessa.

                                            DAVID
                              (to Dick)
                        Come on, dad, hit it out and send 
                        these freaks home!

                        I ve got this, son.

        Dick wiggles his hips and takes a couple practice swings.

          ANGLE ON: Danny and The Cannon stand watching at the 
          fence on the third base side.  The Cannon SEES Danny 
          looking at David and Vanessa.

                                          THE CANNON
                        That the kid who punched you?

                        In all his jerkish glory. 

        The Cannon takes a bat that is leaning against the fence 
        and offers it to Danny.

                        Where d you learn that?  Glee?

        As The Cannon eyes David, we...

          ANGLE ON: Terry and Dick.  Dick readies himself.

                                          DICK
                        I m gonna take you so deep you ll 
                        think you re a Chilean miner...

          Terry steps on the rubber, grabs the ball tightly, winds 
        up and uncorks a pitch with everything she has.  The 
          pitch soars toward Dick and he has no time to react as it 
        HITS DICK RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES.

                                          THE CROWD
                        Ooh...!

        Dick goes down hard holding his face.

          ANGLE ON: The Cannon and Danny.

                        That s my boy!

        BACK ON: Terry moves off the mound towards Dick and...

                        Didn t hit it... See you on the 
                        field, Dick.

          Terry marches off toward Danny and The Cannon.

                        team.

          Danny hugs Terry.  Terry looks back at Gigi who raises 
        her arms in victory.  Michael steps in and they both 
          start making the  Y-M-C-A  letters with their arms.

          David rushes onto the field to help his dad.  

          Danny looks at Vanessa who smiles at him.  Then...

                                            VANESSA
                              (re: Terry)
                        Oh, I want to play for her.

        Off the Gannon family walking from the field, we...



          Terry and Danny are about to play catch.

                        mechanics... Just follow through 
                        and hit the target...

          Terry bangs her mitt and Danny throws.  The ball flies 
        over Terry s head and through the garage window.

                                            DANNY

                        The Cannon probably locked himself 
                        out again.  You find the ball.

          Terry exits to...



        The Cannon gets out of his car and starts bashing the 
          windows of the Prius in.  As he bashes the back window 
        in, A MAN, DOUG, comes running out of the house.

                                          DOUG
                        Hey!  Stop!  What the hell are

                                          THE CANNON
                        If your kid ever touches my 
                        grandson again, I won't be coming 
                        back here to get him.  I'm coming

                        What are you talking about?  I 
                        don t have a kid!

        The Cannon pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket.

                        No.  It s 4622...!

                        Never mind...

        The Cannon drops the bat, runs to his car and peels out.

          Terry walks with Danny toward home plate with a bat.   
        She turns to SEE Vanessa behind the fence watching Danny.  
          Danny waves to her and she waves back.

                                            TERRY
                        First practice.  Go on.  Show her 
                        what you got.

          Danny runs to third base.  Terry grabs a practice ball, 
          steps up to the plate and...

                                            TERRY
                        OK, Angles... Let s get one...

          Terry hits a ground ball between third and short.  Danny 
        and Parvu both go for it and SMASH INTO EACH OTHER, face 
        to face.  They both go down holding their faces.

                                            TERRY
                        Aw, crap...



          Steve, holding a book of matches, strikes and flicks one 
          after another onto the grass.  He s started a tiny fire. 

        The CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL Terry watching.  She turns on 
          SPRINKLERS which soak Steve and puts out the little fire.

                                            TERRY
                        No matches!



          Terry approaches Hunter and Owen who are sitting in the 
          dirt, legs crossed.  They have carved out a checker board 
          design in the infield dirt.

                                            TERRY
                        What are you two doing? 

                                          OWEN
                        We re playing dirt chess.

                        Five laps.  Go.  Now! 



          Terry is at home plate.  She yells to Steve who has the 
        ball at first base but doesn t know what to do.  

                                            TERRY
                        Throw it home!  Throw it!

          Steve throws the ball toward home.  It whistle by Terry 
          uncaught.  Terry looks around. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

        The CAMERA ANGLES to reveal DUDLEY at the side gate 
          paying a DELIVERY GUY for a PIZZA. 

                                            TERRY
                        Dudley, what are you doing?

                        Relax, lady...



          SHINJO is fielding third base.  He looks toward Angel who 
          barrels toward him from second base.   As he get near, 
          Shinjo, grabs Angel and gives him a JUDO FLIP.  Terry 
        runs over. 

                                            TERRY
                        Shinjo, no!  Why did you do that? 

                                          SHINJO
                        He was trying to attack me. 

                                            TERRY
                        No... He s a base runner... He was 
                        just... Let s try you in the 
                        outfield. 



        The team is lined up taking turns to catch fly balls from 
          Terry.  Ryan makes a catch.  Michael runs up and slaps 
        him on the butt. 

                                            MICHAEL
                        Nice catch. 

          Vance steps up and misses his catch.  Michael runs up and 
          slaps Vance on the butt. 

                                            MICHAEL
                        Nice catch...

          Herbie gets ready to field a fly ball.  Michael runs up 
        and slaps him on the butt. 

                                            MICHAEL

                        She didn t hit it yet. 

                                            MICHAEL
                        My bad.                                                                                     31.



          Parvu sits in the dugout and takes a big drag off his 
          INHALER.  Terry enters and sits down next to the kid. 

                                            TERRY
                        How you feeling? 

                                            PARVU
                        Everyone says I m fine.  But, I 
                        know I m sick.  It s just a matter 
                        of time, you know? 

                                            TERRY
                        Good talk. 

          Terry gets up and exits. 



        The team is gathered on one knee around Terry. 

                                            TERRY
                        So... A couple of things we talked 
                        about today that I want you to 
                        focus on before next practice -  
                        Gotta wear your shoes.   All the 
                        time.

                                            TERRY
                        Let s play it safe - all the time. 
                        Also, no phone calls when you re 
                        out in the field.

                                          ALL PLAYERS
                        What about texts? 

                                            TERRY
                        No texts.  
                                (then)
                        And lastly, I don t know why I 
                        even have to address this -  There 
                        are no ghosts in the outfield...

                                            VANCE
                        You calling me a liar?

                                            TERRY
                        No ghosts.  Never have been.  
                        Never will be.  
                                (then)
                        Any questions? 

                                          DUDLEY
                        Yeah.  These jerseys suck.  What 
                        the hell s an  Angle  anyway?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

        The Kids laugh.  Dudley throws his mitt at Ryan.

                        Cut it out...
                                (then)
                        I ll tell you what  Angles  are... 
                        They re misfits, they don t always 
                        fit in the way they re supposed 
                        to... Just like all of us.  No one 
                        in this league wants this team 
                        here.  They expect us to lose 
                        every game.  And kids from the 
                        other teams... They re gonna call 
                        you fat, and weird, and foreign, 
                        and creepy, and unathletic, and 
                        weak, and gay, and crazy, and 
                        scared...

          Terry looks at Danny.

                                            TERRY
                        So, wouldn t it be great, if just 
                        one time, you could take all the 
                        insults, all the bullying, all the 
                        meanness, and just wrap it up and 
                        shove it right up their asses?

          Daniel, the smallest player, raises his hand.

                                            DANNY
                        I do... I want to shove it up 
                        their asses.

                        Anyone else...?

          A beat, then all the Players raise their hands.

                                            TERRY
                        The good news is, I can teach how 
                        to do that.  Right here on this 
                        field.  But it s going to take 
                        hard work, and sacrifice, and 
                        above all... Being a team.  Now, 
                        are you with me?!

                                          TEAM
                        YEAH!

          Terry puts her hand out.

                                            TERRY
                        OK!  Everyone in.  Angles on 
                        three...

        The team all put there hands on top of Terry s.

                        you Tuesday.

        The Players all exit.  Danny moves to Terry carrying a 
          brand new baseball.  He holds it out.

                                            DANNY
                        Here, mom.

                                            TERRY
                        You want me to hold that for you?

                                            DANNY
                        No.  It s for you.  It s your game 
                        ball.  You said a game ball goes 
                        to the person who sacrifices the 
                        most for their team... Well, after 
                        that mess, clearly you ve 
                        sacrificed the most for all of us.  
                        I want you to know... I love you.

          Terry takes the ball and fights a tear.

                                            TERRY
                        You re a helluva kid.

          Terry and Danny hug for a moment, then...

                                            TERRY
                        Grab those balls off the mound and 
                        let s get out of here. 

          Danny runs to the pitcher s mound and picks up a ball.   
        He turns and sees VANESSA at home plate holding the bat. 

                                            DANNY
                        Vanessa... Hey.

                                            VANESSA
                        Pitch me one. 

                                            DANNY
                        OK, but don t be mad if I strike 
                        you out.  I ve been practicing. 

          Danny pitches the ball to Vanessa and she CRUSHES a line 
          drive over his head.  ANGLE ON: Terry who s been 
          watching.

                        So, your name s Vanessa right? 

        As Terry moves toward Vanessa, we...
