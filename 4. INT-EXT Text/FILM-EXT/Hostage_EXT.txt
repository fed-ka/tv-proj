The sky is overlaid with the slow whup-whup-whup of an LAPD
helicopter flashing through the frame, here and gone.
LAPD radio transmissions crackle like static electricity
around a dirty clapboard bungalow that looks like the
puckered asshole of Eagle Rock.
A man's terrified voice screams invisibly from the house --
MALIK'S VOICE
I'm gonna kill this dog!
You make my
wife talk to me or I'm gonna shoot this
fuckin' dog!
A five-member SWAT tactical team appears out of nowhere--full
black assault gear, M5s, gloved and masked--hustling into
position on either side of the front door.
Only now do we
get the full picture:
Helicopters overhead, radio cars
surrounding the house, an army of cops itching the pull the
trigger --
When the tac team is good to go, the team leader gives a
thumbs-up to --
SERGEANT JEFF TALLEY AND LT. MURRAY LEIFITZ
Talley and Leifitz are hunkered behind the LAPD Command and
Control van.
Leifitz is the Crisis Response Team SWAT
commander; Talley, the primary negotiator.
It's so hot out
here that Talley has stripped down to a tee-shirt and vest.
LEIFITZ
They're good to go, Talley.
Your word,
and we're in the house.
TALLEY
No one's going anywhere, L-T.
We can
talk this guy down.
Talley lifts a dedicated crisis phone that's been hardlined
into the house, his tone reasonable and friendly --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
(into the phone)
Hey, George?
George, don't kill the dog,
okay?
We don't want to hear a gun go off
in there.
A phone crashes through the window and lands in the front
yard --
MALIK'S VOICE
(screaming from the house)
Fuck you!
LEIFITZ
I don't think he wants to talk.
Frustrated, Talley slumps back against the van as the SWAT
Intelligence Officer, Lloyd Keith, scuttles up to them --
TALLEY
Where's the guy's wife?
KEITH
She didn't take the kid to her sister's.
The neighbors were wrong.
TALLEY
Goddamnit, you said we had her.
I told
him we had her!
KEITH
We got bad information, Talley.
I can't
pull her out of my ass!
Up at the house, George Edward Malik steps into the window.
Malik is a forty-year-old freaked-out loser who has turned
the corner on insanity --
MALIK
(shouting at Talley)
You said my wife was gonna talk to me,
you lying fuck!
I'm gonna kill her dog,
then shoot myself!
I mean it!
Talley stares at Malik, thinking, then abruptly grabs Keith
by the collar --
TALLEY
(to Keith)
Pull the dog's name out of your ass.
Get
the dog's name.
Talley steps out from behind the command van so that Malik
can see him.
LEIFITZ
(alarmed by Talley's move)
Talley!
You're in the line of fire!
Talley ignores Leifitz; he is totally focused on Malik and on
defusing the situation --
TALLEY
I didn't lie to you, George.
You scared
your wife pretty good last night.
We're
having a hard time finding her.
MALIK
She better talk to me!
I'm gonna kill
her goddamned dog!
TALLEY
You and I have been talking for, what,
sixteen hours?
Keep talking.
Is that
your dog, too?
Malik steps away from the window --
MALIK'S VOICE
I don't know whose dog it is.
She lied
about everything else, so she probably
lied about the dog.
TALLEY
I know you're hurting.
You lose your
job, you find out your wife's fucking
another guy . . . but don't give up.
We'll have her talk to you.
MALIK'S VOICE
Then why won't she open her mouth?!
Why
doesn't the bitch say something???
Something about Malik's statement bothers Talley.
The
wording is odd, suspicious --
TALLEY
George?
Come back to the window.
MALIK'S VOICE
STOP LOOKING AT ME!!!
Talley grows even more concerned.
Was Malik talking to him?
TALLEY
George?
Leave the dog alone and come to
the window.
Talley sees Keith rejoin Leifitz --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
(to Leifitz)
What's the dog's name?
LEIFITZ
The neighbors say he doesn't have a dog.
The pieces fall into place for Talley:
The wife that no one
can find, the dog that doesn't exist....
MALIK'S VOICE
OPEN YOUR GODDAMNED MOUTH OR I'M GONNA
SHOOT THIS DOG!
In a single terrible moment, Talley realizes that Malik is
not talking to him; he's talking to his wife --
TALLEY
Murray!!
They're in the house!
His
wife's in the house!
Even as Talley screams, a gunshot echoes from the house,
freezing the moment.
A second shot follows the first as the
tactical team breaches the front door --
Talley sprints forward, running as hard as he can in
nightmare slow motion --
A rotted-out Toyota pickup lurches to a stop alongside the
minimart, white-boy hip-hop booming on the radio which dies
with the engine --
Dennis Rooney is driving; twenty-three years old, working-
class desert trash with a high opinion of his own brooding
good looks.
In the middle: Kevin Rooney, nineteen, scared
shitless at what they're about to do.
Riding shotgun:
Mars
Krupchek, twenty-four, a large pasty guy with a shaved head
and faraway eyes.
KEVIN
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.
I thought
we were gonna go to the movies.
DENNIS
(grins past Kevin to Mars)
Mars?!
Whattaya think, dude?
Out here
on the edge, no one around, it's perfect,
right?
MARS
I'll check it out.
Mars slides out of the truck.
He has a tattoo on the back of
his tattoo that says:
BURN IT.
As soon as Mars is gone, Dennis frowns at Kevin --
DENNIS
Try to act cool, okay?
He's gonna think
you're a dick.
KEVIN
Robbing this place is gonna put you back
in prison.
DENNIS
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
KEVIN
We got jobs, man; we're working.
Why
even take the chance?
DENNIS
Because if you don't take the chance,
you're already dead.
Dennis pulls a pistol from his pants to check the magazine.
DENNIS (CONT'D)
Thirty seconds, we'll be down the road.
Thirty seconds.
Then we'll go to the
movies.
Mars returns and nods his approval --
MARS
It's perfect.
That's all it takes.
A forty-something soccer mom named Margaret Hammond is about
to enter the minimart when Dennis and Kevin burst out,
knocking her on her ass.
Mars follows a moment later --
Margaret watches their red pickup lurch away, then rushes
into the store --
Flanders Road is lined with trees, hedges, and the exclusive
housing developments that dot the countryside around Bristo
Camino.
The Toyota jerks to a stop well off the road, and Dennis,
Mars, and Kevin pile out, stuffing pistols and bullets into
their pockets --
KEVIN
That woman's gonna call the cops.
DENNIS
Shut up, goddamnit!
Just calm down!
KEVIN
What if he's dead?
What if you killed
him?
Dennis grabs him by the throat; Mars steps between them --
MARS
People are looking.
Dennis sees that Mars is right; people in passing cars are
looking.
He releases his brother --
DENNIS
That's why we gotta keep going.
I'm not
gonna go in for murder.
KEVIN
We're on foot.
We can't get away.
DENNIS
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass.
Every house has a car in the garage.
All we have to do is take one.
Dennis and Mars take off for the wall, Kevin reluctantly
following --
The camera reveals a two-story California Mediterranean home
in the exclusive housing development known as York Estates.
You can't get in the door for less than one-point-five, and
this house costs more:
Eight thousand square feet of used
brick and custom tile set on a lushly landscaped acre --
WALTER SMITH'S VOICE
You can pick them up whenever you want.
A boom box blasts the latest teendiva megahit as Walter's
sixteen-year-old daughter, Jennifer, stretches out in cutoff
shorts and a bikini top, working on her tan.
Walter and Thomas appear in the French doors that open from
the back of the house --
WALTER
(calling)
Jen!
Come feed your brother!
He's
wasting away!
JENNIFER
Can't we send him to Florida?
WALTER
Jen, c'mon, chop-chop!
I've got to
finish my work!
Jennifer rolls her eyes, rises from the chaise longue, and
pads to the house.
As she clears the frame, the camera
swings toward the overgrown wall at the edge of the property.
Dennis silenty drops into the bushes --
A sky blue Bristo Camino patrol car cruises along Flanders
Road --
Mike Welch climbs out of the patrol car and keys his shoulder
mike as he appraises the house --
WELCH
(into his radio mike)
They had to go through the yard at 455
Castle Way.
I'm going to approach.
Welch slowly moves up the walk toward the front door --
Welch is halfway up the walk when the door opens and
Jennifer, clearly terrified, peers out.
Welch hesitates --
WELCH
(into his mike)
Teenage female opened the front door.
(to Jennifer)
Miss, I found an abandoned vehicle on the
other side of your wall.
Did three young
men run through the area?
Jennifer doesn't answer.
Her eyes fill until two huge tears
roll down her cheeks.
Welch grows uneasy.
Something is
wrong, but he doesn't know what.
He stays where he is --
WELCH (CONT'D)
Miss?
JENNIFER
I didn't . . . see anyone.
Welch stares into Jennifer's eyes, pointedly shifting his
gaze to ask the silent question:
Are they here?
tumbles backward, struggling weakly to pull his gun as blood
bubbles in his mouth.
He tries to rise, but can't --
WELCH
(into his radio)
Officer down.
Jesus, I've been shot.
RADIO VOICE
Mike?
Mike, what did you say?!
Mike Welch blinks at the sky, but cannot answer --
Talley wheels into a wide, spacious cul-de-sac lined with
expensive estate homes, and pulls up behind another radio
car.
Anders and Jorgenson are crouched in the street --
Bullets snap into Talley's windshield, starring the glass --
TALLEY
Sonofabitch.
Talley scrambles out of his car --
Talley takes cover behind his front wheel.
Anders and
Jorgenson are young guys; they've never worked a high-crime
area; they've never made a felony arrest; and right now
they're scared shitless.
Mike Welch lies on the Smiths' front lawn, forty feet away --
ANDERS
Welch is down!
They shot him!
JORGENSON
We think it's the three guys who robbed
Kim's.
TALLEY
Are civilians inside?
JORGENSON
He said something about a girl --
TALLEY
Holster your guns!
Another shot cracks from the house as we hear the faint wail
of approaching sirens.
Talley edges around his car, trying
to see Welch --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
(calling)
Mike!
Mike, can you hear me?
ANDERS
I think he's dead!
TALLEY
Don't shout, Larry.
I'm three feet away.
Talley considers the situation and comes up with a plan --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
We have to cordon off the streets, then
evacuate these houses.
JORGENSON
What are we going to do about Mike?
TALLEY
Keep your head down.
Talley scrambles back into his car.
He backs up, then powers
the car up the drive and onto the front lawn --
WITH WELCH
Talley roars to a stop between Welch and the house, using the
car as a shield.
More shots ping off his car as Talley
climbs out --
TALLEY
How you doing, buddy?
You still alive?
Welch moans.
His shirt is soaked with blood where the
bullets caught him beneath his vest.
Talley can't waste
time.
The siren is closer now --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
Jesus.
You hang on.
Talley hoists Welch into the backseat, then dives behind the
wheel.
He fishtails off the lawn and up the street --
The ambulance waits as Talley powers to a stop --
TALLEY
He's in the backseat!
Paramedics pull Mike Welch from the car as Talley gets out.
He can see into the cul-de-sac from here, where Anders and
Jorgenson still hunker behind their car.
Talley keys his
radio --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
This is Talley.
Who's on?
His radio crackles with overlapping voices --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
One at a time!
Clear the air!
(as they settle)
Louise?
Talk to me.
What do we have?
LOUISE'S VOICE
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Frantic voices once more overlap --
COP VOICES
What about Mike?
Is Welch alive?
What
happened?
TALLEY
(forcefully)
Quiet!
I want radio discipline.
(as they quiet)
Mike's hanging in.
Larry, Jorgy?
Listen
up.
JORGENSON'S VOICE
Go, Chief.
TALLEY
Find out who lives at four-five-five.
We
gotta know who's in there.
LOUISE'S VOICE
Chief?
Mike said a young girl answered
the door.
TALLEY
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
LOUISE'S VOICE
(hesitant)
He didn't say.
TALLEY
Then we don't know if she's part of this
or not.
Mickey, you up?
MIKKELSON'S VOICE
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
TALLEY
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on
Flanders.
You see it?
MIKKELSON'S VOICE
It's right in front of us.
TALLEY
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's
name.
LOUISE'S VOICE
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the
minimart.
TALLEY
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a
crime scene like that.
Put a unit out
there.
LOUISE'S VOICE
We only have eight officers on duty,
Chief.
More sirens are approaching, but their help seems too little,
too late.
Talley stares up the cul-de-sac at the Smiths'
house as if this was a terrible nightmare --
TALLEY
(to himself)
That's not enough.
LOUISE
What's that, Chief?
Say again.
TALLEY
Get everyone out here.
Then call the
Sheriffs.
Tell them we have a possible
hostage situation.
Talley is at his car with Anders and two other officers,
Leigh Metzger, a woman in her early thirties, and Cliff
Campbell, a slender guy who looks like a retired security
cop.
Talley is getting information reports both in person
and over the radio --
ANDERS
(referring to notes)
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela
Smith.
They've got two kids, a girl
about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer
and Thomas.
TALLEY
That would be the girl who opened the
door.
Are the others inside?
ANDERS
The mother is in Florida visiting her
sister.
The father works at home, so
he's probably inside.
Talley keys his mike --
TALLEY
(into his mike)
Louise?
LOUISE'S VOICE
Go, Chief.
TALLEY
Get a phone number for the Smiths.
MIKKELSON'S VOICE
(from the radio)
Chief, Mikkelson.
TALLEY
Go, Mickey.
MIKKELSON'S VOICE
The truck is registered to Dennis James
Rooney, white male, twenty-two.
He has
an Agua Dulce address.
TALLEY
Contact the landlord.
I want to know
employment, friends, family, anything we
can find out about this guy.
A news helicopter swoops overhead in a tight turn.
The cops
look up --
CAMPBELL
What in hell is that?
TALLEY
(grimly)
News hawks.
There'll be more.
They
monitor our frequencies.
Talley realizes that his officers are staring at the
helicopter as if they've never seen one; these people have
never dealt with a crime this large, and have probably never
even seen a felon.
Talley keys the mike again --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
Everyone be cool.
That's our job right
now--stabilize the situation and don't
let things get out of hand.
All we have
to do is hang on until the Sheriffs take
over.
That's all we have to do.
No one looks particularly convinced --
METZGER
How do we do that?
TALLEY
That's my job, Metzger.
That's why I get
the big bucks.
Talley puts away his mike --
Talley is once more behind his car.
He's on his cell phone,
with Jorgenson nearby --
TALLEY
(into his phone)
My name is Jeff Talley.
Is this Dennis
Rooney?
Intercut Dennis on the phone in Walter's office --
DENNIS
You with the cops?
TALLEY
The Bristo Police Department.
Look out
the window.
You see the car?
Dennis peers through the shutters --
DENNIS
Yeah.
I'm Rooney.
TALLEY
We had an awful lot of shooting.
You
need a doctor in there?
Dennis shoots a guilty glance at Walter, then lies --
DENNIS
We're cool.
TALLEY
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.
I want to
hear it from him.
DENNIS
Fuck you.
I'm running this shit.
You
talk to me.
TALLEY
How about your two friends?
You don't
have a man dying in there, do you?
DENNIS
They're fine.
Talley cups the phone to tell Jorgenson --
TALLEY
All three subjects are confirmed inside.
Call off the house-to-house.
(back to the phone)
Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your
situation --
DENNIS
(interrupting)
You don't have to explain shit!
That
Chinaman pulled a gun.
We wrestled for
it.
That Chinaman shot himself.
TALLEY
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.
He died.
DENNIS
How about the cop?
TALLEY
Dennis?
I want you to release those
people.
DENNIS
Fuck that.
They're the only thing
stopping you from blowing us away.
TALLEY
We're not coming in there by force, okay?
No one wants to hurt you.
DENNIS
I got these people!
You try to come get
me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
The phone clicks in Talley's ear as Dennis slams down the
phone --
Talley, Jane, and Amanda are walking to the street.
Amanda
is excited; she thinks this is cool --
AMANDA
Are men with guns really barricaded in a
house?
TALLEY
Just around the corner and up that
street.
See the helicopters?
Five news choppers now hover high over the house.
The crime
scene is only two blocks away.
Close.
JANE
Wait by the car, Mandy.
Give me a minute
with Dad.
They wait until Amanda is gone, then --
TALLEY
(apologizing)
I should've called.
This thing broke
right after we spoke, then everything
happened so fast --
JANE
Don't worry about it.
How are you doing?
TALLEY
The Sheriffs will take over when they get
here.
JANE
But they're not here yet.
Tell me about
you.
Jane touches his arm --
JANE (CONT'D)
Jesus, you're shaking.
Self-conscious, Talley moves away so that he's out of reach --
TALLEY
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at
the Thai place?
I'll meet you there as
soon as I can.
JANE
You sure?
TALLEY
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
JANE
I'm in no rush.
Maybe later we can talk.
Talley gives her a gentle nod, then watches her walk away
until --
TALLEY
Jane?
She turns back, her eyes asking 'what?'
TALLEY (CONT'D)
I'm scared shitless.
JANE
That's okay.
I love you anyway.
Talley and Jane share the moment, and then she walks away.
A news chopper swings by overhead bringing us to the main
entrance of York Estates.
The entrance has been blocked, and
cars are being turned away, so traffic is backed up both ways
along the street --
A low-rent motel on the road between Bristo Camino and
Newhall.
Glen Howell's Mercedes is parked on the side, along
with several other cars.
It's late-afternoon going into evening.
The sun is sinking
fast --
The sun has set.
The donut shop glows greasily at the end of
a strip mall.
It is empty except for the overweight woman
behind the counter and a lone man seated at a window booth --
Talley and Leigh Metzger stride through a pool of street light
as she reports --
METZGER
PacBell shows six lines into the house.
They blocked all six like you wanted.
TALLEY
I have the only number that can call into
the house?
METZGER
Yes, sir.
They'll only accept calls from
your cell.
TALLEY
Way to go.
They arrive at Larry Anders, who is waiting at his car with a
slim, nervous cement contractor named Brad Dill --
ANDERS
Chief, this is Brad Dill.
Dennis and
Kevin work for him.
DILL
I didn't know anything about this.
I
didn't know what they were gonna do.
TALLEY
Mr. Dill, these pricks didn't know what
they were going to do until they did it.
I want you to take a look at something.
Metzger holds out a still picture that was made from Junior
Kim's security tape --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
Can you identify this man?
DILL
That would be Mars Krupchek.
Jesus, he
works for me, too.
TALLEY
(to Metzger)
Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek'
through DMV and NCIC.
Tell her to list
the tattoo as an identifier.
Metzger hurries away as Talley turns back to Dill --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?
Hot-
tempered?
Anything like that?
DILL
Keeps to himself, more like.
TALLEY
You have his address?
DILL
Pretty sure I do.
Yeah, here we go --
Dill pulls out a tattered address book.
Talley hands the
book to Anders, who copies the address --
TALLEY
(to Anders)
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a
telephonic search warrant.
When you get
the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer
search his house.
ANDERS
Yes, sir.
Anders turns away as Metzger calls from Mrs. Pena's door --
METZGER
Chief!
The Sheriffs are ten minutes out!
Talley has wanted to hear that, but now his sense of relief
is tempered by something he did not expect:
Loss.
Talley keys his shoulder mike --
TALLEY
(into his radio)
Louise?
LOUISE'S VOICE
Go, Chief.
TALLEY
Call Jane for me.
She's at the little
Thai place.
LOUISE'S VOICE
I know the one.
TALLEY
Tell her I'm almost home.
The Sheriff's Crisis Response Team rolls through the streets
like an invading army:
A brown sedan leads a huge van known
as the Mobile Command Post, which is followed by a Sheriff's
SWAT support vehicle, two SWAT Suburbans, and four radio
units.
Pools of light from the helicopters follow their progress --
Talley walks out to meet the lead vehicle as the convoy
stops.
Up and down the row, uniformed Sheriffs pile out of
their vehicles and off-load their gear --
Two people climb out of the lead car:
Will Maddox, a
bespectacled African-American Sheriff's SWAT negotiator, and
Captain Laura Martin, the CRT commander --
TALLEY
I'm Talley.
Who's in charge?
MARTIN
Laura Martin.
This is Will Maddox, the
primary negotiator --
MADDOX
Is the perimeter around the house secure?
TALLEY
I've got fourteen officers on my
department including me.
We're as secure
as we can be.
MADDOX
(to Martin)
Permission to deploy the line?
MARTIN
Do it.
TALLEY
(to Maddox)
Don't crowd the house.
The alpha's a kid
named Rooney.
He's amped up and
volatile.
Maddox turns away to bark orders into his shoulder mike --
MARTIN
Sounds like you know the job.
TALLEY
I've done it once or twice.
I blocked
their phones to incoming calls, so you'll
have to cut in a hard line to talk to
him.
MARTIN
(over her shoulder)
Maddox!
You got that?
MADDOX
Doing it now!
MARTIN
(back to Talley)
I'd like you to brief my supervisors
before we take over the scene.
TALLEY
Whatever you want.
Talley and Martin hurry toward her troops --
Martin, Maddox, and her supervisors are gathered around
Talley when the gunshots crack across the neighborhood --
TALLEY
(startled)
Who's that shooting?
Martin, what's
going on?
Radio transmissions crackle over Martin's radio --
RADIO VOICES
Shots fired!
We are taking fire on the
back wall!
Talley immediately knows what's happening, and he knows why --
TALLEY
They're too close!
I told you not to
crowd him!
Pull back your people; do not
breach that house!
Talley sprints toward the cul-de-sac --
Talley, Martin, and Maddox run into position behind a
Sheriff's unit where a deputy has set up the dedicated crisis
phone --
Talley grabs up the phone --
TALLEY
(to the deputy)
This thing good?
Talley doesn't wait for the confused deputy to answer; he
presses the button in the handle that dials the phone --
MADDOX
What in hell are you doing?
He's
shooting at my men!
The phone rings in Talley's ear --
TALLEY
(to Maddox)
Then get your men off the wall!
(to Martin)
You breach that house, we're gonna have a
bloodbath!
I know this guy, Captain --
I can talk to him.
MARTIN
(to Maddox)
Order your men to stand down.
The phone is still ringing.
Talley pulls the mike from the
deputy's car and speaks over the public address --
TALLEY
(over the p.a.)
Look out the window, Dennis.
We are NOT
entering the house.
We're pulling back.
The Bristo officers manning the gate swing the blockade aside
and wave Talley through --
The assembled television microwave vans, radio newsvans, and
reporters are parked together in an empty lot one block from
the front gate.
Ken Seymore steps into the street, speaking into a cell phone
as he watches Talley drive away --
SEYMORE
(into his phone)
He's leaving now.
A traffic light on the outskirts of town, deserted until
Talley's car pulls to a stop --
The three cars turn into the alley.
They stop, the first and
last cars bumper-to-bumper with Talley's.
The cars are so
close to Talley that his own vehicle is pinned; he couldn't
drive away now even if he wanted --
The helicopters orbit in the distance; the empty lot with the
news vans is in the background.
Talley turns into the development, then stops at the side of
the street where Larry Anders is waiting --
Talley pulls up behind the Sheriffs' command van.
Martin,
surprised to see Talley, steps from the van --
TALLEY
I'm re-assuming command of the scene.
Martin is surprised and angry --
MARTIN
Excuse me?
You requested our help.
You
turned over command --
TALLEY
And now I'm taking it back.
We're
getting Smith out of the house.
Talley heads for the cul-de-sac --
Talley joins Maddox behind the car --
MADDOX
What put a wild hair up your ass?
TALLEY
I changed my mind.
That's all you need
to know.
Talley picks up the dedicated crisis phone that's been cut
into the Smiths' telephone line.
He lifts the receiver and
presses a button.
The phone inside the house rings --
Intercut Dennis inside Smith's office.
He answers --
DENNIS
That you, Talley?
TALLEY
The one and only.
We got a little
problem out here, Dennis.
DENNIS
You oughta try on the problem I got in
here.
TALLEY
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Dennis shoots a nervous glance at Walter, who's twitching and
shuddering on the couch --
DENNIS
We been through that.
Forget it.
TALLEY
We can't forget it.
The Sheriffs think
you won't let me talk to Smith because
he's dead.
They think you murdered him.
Maddox can't believe that Talley is saying this --
MADDOX
(low, so that Dennis can't
hear)
What in hell are you doing?!
DENNIS
That's bullshit!
The guy's right here!
He's alive!
TALLEY
(pressing Dennis harder)
If you don't let me talk to him, they're
going to attack the house.
Maddox grabs Talley's arm, his voice a low hiss --
MADDOX
You're gonna set him off, goddamnit!
That's crazy!
DENNIS
(screaming)
They better not!
Talley pushes Maddox away and amps the pressure on Dennis --
TALLEY
Help me keep them out!
Let me speak to
Smith, Dennis.
Let me speak to him right
now.
Dennis is freaking.
He believes that the Sheriffs are about
to crash through the doors --
DENNIS
SHIT!!!!
Now Talley throttles back; he senses that Dennis is at the
breaking point and wants to coax him back from the edge --
TALLEY
(calmer; coaxing)
Talk to me, Dennis.
Help me help you.
Why can't you put Smith on the phone?
Dennis finally makes the admission --
DENNIS
(quietly)
He got knocked out.
It's like he's
sleeping.
He just lays there.
Talley gives a thumbs-up to Maddox, who sits back in awe.
This crazy shit is working --
TALLEY
(to Dennis)
Now I understand.
That helps.
I can
make them understand that.
DENNIS
Okay.
TALLEY
Let me come get him.
DENNIS
Fuck that!
You bastards will jump me!
TALLEY
If you won't let me come in, then put him
outside.
DENNIS
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out
the door!
TALLEY
You've already helped yourself once,
Dennis; be smart again.
If you save his
life, it'll help when you get to court.
Dennis is at the edge; he's looking straight down into his
deepest fears.
He finally relents --
DENNIS
Fuck you, Talley, fuck you!
You and one
other guy, but that's it!
I want you
stripped!
I gotta know you don't have
guns!
Dennis slams down the phone --
Talley lowers the crisis phone, then looks at Maddox --
TALLEY
Bring up the ambulance.
Mobile banks of flood lamps illuminate the front of the
house.
The ambulance waits behind the lights; tactical
officers with M5s and M16s hunker in position in case the
program goes south --
Talley and a paramedic named Bigelow emerge between the
lights, wearing only shorts and shoes.
Bigelow is carrying a
collapsable stretcher --
They stop in the mouth of the drive with a full view of the
front door.
Talley lifts his cell phone --
TALLEY
(into the phone)
Okay, Dennis, we won't approach the house
until you've closed the door.
The front door opens, a crack at first, then wider.
The line
of officers behind the lights shifts --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
(over his shoulder)
Easy....
Kevin and Mars waddle out with Walter Smith between them.
They put him down about six feet from the front door, then
return to the house --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
(to Bigelow)
Let's do it.
Talley and Bigelow move forward.
When they reach Walter,
Bigelow opens the stretcher and locks out the frame.
He
peels back Walter's eyelids and flashes a penlight --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
How's he look?
BIGELOW
He's got a concussion for sure.
I'm
going to brace him.
As Bigelow sets a cervical neck brace, Talley gets the creepy
feeling that he's being watched.
He turns toward the
shutters, and finds a pair of eyes only inches from his own.
It's Mars.
Talley stares at Mars, and Mars stares back.
It's as if
they're locked in a contest of wills until --
BIGELOW (CONT'D)
Let's get him on the stretcher.
Talley turns away to help Bigelow --
BIGELOW (CONT'D)
I'll support his head and shoulders.
You
lift his hips and knees.
On three.
Three.
As they carry Walter away, Talley glances back at the eyes.
Mars is still watching him --
IN THE CUL-DE-SAC--TALLEY AND BIGELOW
are surrounded by cops as soon as they step into the shadows
behind the lights.
Another paramedic takes the stretcher
from Talley.
Maddox is waiting with Talley's clothes --
MADDOX
You ready to tell me what's going on?
Talley pulls on his pants --
TALLEY
No.
Talley stalks straight to the ambulance, pulling on his
sweatshirt as he goes --
As Talley emerges from the van, he pulls Metzger aside --
TALLEY
I want you waiting in Smith's lap.
I
want to know the second--and I mean the
second--that he wakes up.
As Metzger hurries after the ambulance, a phone in Talley's
pocket rings.
He's startled and scared; it might be the
Watchman.
Talley takes out the Watchman's white phone, but
it's not ringing.
He answers his other phone --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Talley.
ANDERS' VOICE
It's me, Chief.
Can you talk?
Talley notices that Martin, Maddox, and the others are
staring at him.
He turns away --
TALLEY
(into his phone)
What'd you find out?
ANDERS' VOICE
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry
store in Beverly Hills.
The phone
company shows no unusual --
TALLEY
(cutting him off)
Dead end--it's a clone.
What about the
Mustang?
ANDERS' VOICE
It was stolen.
Talley lowers the phone in frustration, then --
TALLEY
You get anything on Smith?
ANDERS' VOICE
Chief...it's like none of this exists.
I'm sorry.
TALLEY
Keep trying.
Talley pockets his phone.
He watches the ambulance pull
away, then strides back through the banks of lights to the
nearest patrol car.
He grabs the dash mike and keys the
public address --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
(through the p.a.)
Call me.
If you're safe, call me.
Talley's voice echoes across the neighborhood.
Every cop in
the cul-de-sac stares at him.
He has addressed the house
for, apparently, no reason.
Dennis shouts from his window --
DENNIS
I'll be safe when I'm outta here, you
asshole!
I'm not talking any more!
Talley drops the mike without a word and walks away --
Talley is by himself, pacing at the curb well away from the
other officers.
He is holding his cell phone.
Waiting.
Finally, it rings.
Talley answers, listens, then --
TALLEY
Put him on.
Intercut Thomas, phoning Talley in his room --
THOMAS
Is my daddy okay?
TALLEY
The doctors are taking care of him right
now.
Thomas . . . are you safe?
Can you
talk?
THOMAS
I think so.
TALLEY
I need your help with something.
But if
you think those guys could catch you,
then I don't want you to do it, okay?
THOMAS
Okay.
TALLEY
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to
get hurt.
THOMAS
What do you want me to do?
TALLEY
Your dad has two computer disks.
They
have funny names:
Marlon and Al.
THOMAS
He has lots of disks.
TALLEY
I think he was working on them today, so
they're probably in his office.
Could
you find them and see who they belong to?
THOMAS
Dennis won't let me go to the desk.
He
makes me sit on the floor.
Talley absorbs the bad news like his last best hope of saving
his family is circling the drain --
THOMAS (CONT'D)
But I might be able to sneak into the
office if they're not around.
Then I
could open the disks here in my room.
TALLEY
I thought they locked you in your room.
THOMAS
I can get into the crawlspace from my
closet and climb all over the house.
TALLEY
Can you get into the office?
THOMAS
I can get into the den.
The office is
right across the hall.
Talley thinks about what the boy is saying, and what he'll
have to do to get Marlon and Al --
TALLEY
If I get Rooney into the back of the
house, can you find the disks without
being caught?
THOMAS
Yes, sir.
Talley glances toward the SWAT Command Van as he comes up
with a plan --
Martin, Maddox, and several of her supervisors are gathered
outside the van as Talley approaches --
Martin sees him coming and steps away to meet him.
She's
pissed off and she wants answers --
MARTIN
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
TALLEY
I'm looking for you.
I need your
tactical unit.
MARTIN
I'm not stupid!
You can't get out of
here fast enough, then you take back
command; you agree to wait on Smith, then
you risk everything in a stupid stunt to
get him out --
TALLEY
(interrupting)
Don't question me, Captain!
This is my
crime scene!
MARTIN
(shouting over him)
-- then when you get him, you damn near
assault the man in the ambulance!
What
is going on?
Talley glares at her, half-a-heartbeat from going off, and
then he throttles back --
TALLEY
(simply)
I'm a negotiator, Captain.
I negotiate.
That's all you need to know.
Now are you
going to help me or not?
Martin weighs the determination in his eyes.
She's angry,
she's resentful, and she wants to knock Talley onto his ass--
but, instead, she glances back to her van --
MARTIN
Maddox!
Let's give the man a hand!
Talley, Maddox, and several tactical officers are lined along
the rear wall, watching the house.
Talley, with a phone to
his ear, is looking through a night-vision scope --
He can see into the kitchen through the French doors.
Mars
and Jennifer are inside, and, as we watch, Dennis and Kevin
enter --
TALLEY
(into his phone)
Okay, bud, here we go.
Talley hands the scope to Maddox, then keys his radio mike --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
(into his mike)
Captain?
Kill the lights.
Talley approaches the house.
He can see flashlights moving
in the kitchen --
TALLEY
Come on, Dennis.
Talk to me.
Dennis doesn't answer, so Talley moves closer.
He spreads
his hands wide --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
I'm unarmed.
I'm looking at you.
Get
out here and let's talk.
Dennis comes to the French doors.
He stuffs his pistol into
his pants, and opens the doors --
DENNIS
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot
me?
TALLEY
Only if you try to grab me.
We could've
shot you from the wall.
Dennis considers that and accepts it.
He steps out of the
house and walks over to Talley --
TALLEY (CONT'D)
You've been in there a long time.
What're you waiting for?
DENNIS
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison
for the rest of your life?
TALLEY
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I
could.
DENNIS
Maybe that's what I'm doing.
Can I reach
in my pocket, show you something?
Dennis Rooney steps closer because he doesn't want anyone
else to see the wad of money he pulls out --
DENNIS (CONT'D)
That's fifty hundred-dollar bills.
Five
grand.
They got money in this house,
Talley, more than you've ever seen.
Dennis pushes the money back into his pocket.
DENNIS (CONT'D)
How much would it be worth to you,
getting me out of here?
So that's what keeps Dennis in the house--money.
This is the
first that Talley has heard of the money --
TALLEY
You picked a bad house to hole up in,
son.
DENNIS
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your
pocket, no one needs to know.
TALLEY
Give up.
DENNIS
There's a million dollars in there, maybe
two million.
I'll give you half.
Talley stares at Dennis, wondering how much to tell him and
whether or not it will do any good --
TALLEY
The man you sent to the hospital is a
criminal.
He has partners.
This is
their house and their money and they want
it back.
These simple facts settle on Dennis like a funeral shroud--
everything that Smith said earlier now makes a horrible
sense:
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Dennis's eyes fill with defeat and helplessness --
DENNIS
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
TALLEY
Give up, Dennis.
Let these people go.
At least you'll have your life.
Dennis steps inside and pulls the door closed, the darkness
in the house swallowing him like dirty water.
The power is turned on.
The house comes to life --
As Talley turns away, his phone once more rings --
Marion Clewes is stepping from his car as Talley's police
unit rips into the parking lot with flashing lights --
Marion watches Talley and Jorgenson rush into the ER, then he
frowns and punches the speed dial on his phone --
MARION
(into his phone)
We're too late.
The police are here.
Talley is pacing by his car in the deserted parking lot.
He
pounds the hood, cursing, awash in rage and frustration --
And then a phone rings.
Talley takes out the phones.
The white phone is ringing.
The Watchman's phone --
Talley answers furiously, the two of them instantaneously
screaming at each other --
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up bad!
TALLEY
Do you think I'm going to let you murder
someone?!
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
You want a blowtorch on your daughter's
pretty face?!
TALLEY
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now!
I'll give those disks to the real FBI,
you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!
And I've
got Smith!
I've got Smith!!
A profound silence fills the parking lot, both men now
purged.
When the Watchman speaks again, his voice is
measured --
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
I guess we each have something the other
wants.
TALLEY
I guess we do.
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
My people are good to go.
You know who I
mean?
TALLEY
Your phony FBI assholes.
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
We're almost home, you and me.
Keep your
shit together.
This isn't L.A.
TALLEY
What do you mean by that?
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
You don't want another dead child on your
conscience.
The line goes dead --
Talley is returning to the hospital.
As he turns into York
Estates, he's stopped by one of his officers, Dale Cooper.
Talley rolls down his window to see what Cooper wants --
COOPER
Come FBI guys showed up, Chief.
They
said you were expecting them.
TALLEY
They here now?
COOPER
You'll see'm up the street.
Talley nods, and continues through the gate --
Two gray Econoline vans are parked at the curb beneath a
street light, four men in the lead van, two in the rear.
Talley pulls up behind them, then gets out of his car.
He
walks up the middle of the street to the lead van, eyeballing
the men in the vans:
They all have short haircuts and are
wearing black tactical fatigues.
Some of them wear ball caps
that say FBI.
THE DRIVER
You Talley?
TALLEY
Yeah.
The man in the passenger seat, Mr. Jones, gets out.
He looks
the part of FBI SWAT:
black tac fatigues, jump boots, buzzed
hair.
A pistol hangs under his left arm in a ballistic
holster --
MR. JONES
Let me see some ID.
Something with a
picture.
I don't give a shit about your
badge.
Talley takes out his wallet and flashes his photo ID.
Jones
does the same in return --
MR. JONES (CONT'D)
Okay, here's mine.
My name is Special
Agent Jones.
TALLEY
Are all of you named Jones?
MR. JONES
Don't be funny, Chief.
You can't afford
it.
Jones slaps the side of the van.
Doors open, and the
remaining five men climb out.
They strap into vests with FBI
emblazoned on the back, then pass out load-bearing gear, knit
masks, and flash-bang grenades.
MR. JONES (CONT'D)
In a few minutes the white phone is going
to ring.
So let's get our shit straight
before that happens.
TALLEY
You used to be a cop.
All of you used to
be cops.
I can tell by the way you move.
MR. JONES
Don't worry about what we used to be.
TALLEY
How do you people expect this to work?
The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team
here.
MR. JONES
What's my name?
TALLEY
What?
MR. JONES
I asked you my name.
You just saw my
commission slip.
What's my fucking name?
TALLEY
Special Agent Jones.
MR. JONES
Think of me that way and you won't fuck
up.
I'll handle the Sheriffs.
The men at the second van are now passing out MP5s, CAR-15s,
and loaded magazines --
TALLEY
What are you people going to do?
MR. JONES
You and I are gonna straighten this out
with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait
for the man to call.
When he gives the
word, we move.
TALLEY
What does he have on you?
I know why I'm
doing this, but what does he have on you?
One of the other men hands an MP5 to Mr. Jones.
Jones
jacks the bolt to chamber a round.
He slings his gun without
answering --
MR. JONES
Let's go, Chief.
Time to get real.
Jones walks away, and all Talley can do is follow --
We're at the end of a gravel road in the low foothills of
Pearblossom, a farm community of fruit orchards in the low
foothills.
A Bristo Camino police car pulls up outside a thirty-foot
Caravan trailer, and Mikkelson and Dreyer get out.
Mikkelson
lights up the trailer with the radio car's spotlight --
DREYER
Krupchek lives in a shithole.
The trailer is dark and silent.
They walk to the door
carrying their Maglites.
Mikkelson tries the knob --
MIKKELSON
I guess we could jimmy it.
DREYER
I don't want to pay for breaking it.
Mikkelson pulls hard and the door pops open.
Both officers
cringe as a smell like simmering mustard greens rolls out at
them --
MIKKELSON
Christ, that stinks.
Talley, Jones, and Jones's phony "FBI" team are moving down
the cul-de-sac toward the house with Martin at their heels --
MR. JONES
Walter Smith is in the Federal Witness
Protection program.
When Washington
learned about the situation here, they
asked Chief Talley for his cooperation.
MARTIN
This is bullshit.
I should've been
notified.
MR. JONES
I'm sure you will be, Captain, but it's
after midnight.
Now, if you'll pull your
people off the perimeter, I want to get
my people in position.
Martin looks like she wants to spit bullets --
TALLEY
Let it go, Captain.
MARTIN
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Martin relents and stalks away just as Talley's phone rings.
Both Talley and Jones tense at the ring, thinking it might be
the white phone, but it's not --
TALLEY
It's mine.
(into his phone)
Talley.
MIKKELSON'S VOICE
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
TALLEY
Go, Mickey.
Both Mikkelson and Dreyer are leaning against their car.
They look shellshocked.
Mikkelson is making the call --
MIKKELSON
Chief, we just found Krupchek's trailer.
We just went in there.
She trails off and looks at Dreyer for help:
How do I say
this?
Dreyer, at a loss, looks away --
MIKKELSON (CONT'D)
He has human body parts in his
refrigerator.
He has five human heads.
Mikkelson can't handle it any more.
She lowers the phone --
WITH TALLEY
The shock that Mikkelson is feeling sweeps over Talley as
well.
He takes a moment to get his head around this --
TALLEY
(into his phone)
Mickey?
Call the state Homicide Bureau.
Don't touch anything, just sit back and
wait.
MIKKELSON'S VOICE
Yes, sir.
Talley lowers the phone as he stares at the house, wondering
what sort of monster is in there with Thomas and Jennifer.
His gaze shifts to Mr. Jones, who is watching him --
TALLEY
We're getting those kids out of there.
Talley is arguing with Jones, trying to convince the man that
they need to move into the house now --
TALLEY
We've got to get those kids out of there!
MR. JONES
Not until the man calls.
TALLEY
Those kids are in there with a fucking
psychopath!
He kills people!
MR. JONES
They've been in there all day.
Talley's phone rings.
Again, they both think that it's the
white phone, but instead it's Talley's personal phone --
TALLEY
(into his phone)
Talley.
It's Thomas.
His voice cuts in and out, broken by static --
THOMAS'S VOICE
Mars killed Kevin and Dennis!
We're in
the security room.
He's burning the
house --
Thomas' phone cuts out.
Talley turns toward the house and
sees a growing column of smoke.
He looks back at Jones --
TALLEY
You do what you have to do; I'm getting
those kids.
Talley hurries away.
Jones stares after him, then comes to
his own agonized decision.
He catches up --
MR. JONES
Talley!
We'll secure the house, but then
we get the disks.
Talley accepts that; they move toward the house --
The banks of floodlights abruptly shut off, plunging the
house and grounds into darkness --
Talley and Jones slip up to a side window at the front of the
house.
Both are carrying fire extinguishers.
They peer
inside, then Jones uses a pry bar to lift the window --
Talley is alone in his car, his phone to his ear, listening
to the ring at the other end of the line.
A familiar voice
answers --
HOWELL'S VOICE
Hello?
TALLEY
Two words:
Glen Howell.
Intercut Howell in his motel room.
He is thrown by getting
this call --
HOWELL
How did you get this number?
TALLEY
Mr. Jones is dead.
So are two of his
men.
The other three are in jail.
I
have the disks.
I have Walter Smith.
And you know what, you motherfucker?
I
have you.
HOWELL
I have your fucking family.
Don't forget
that.
TALLEY
I also have a couple of million in cash.
Call Sonny Benza.
Ask if I can keep it.
This throws Howell, too.
He didn't expect anything like
this; not from Talley --
HOWELL
What do you want?
TALLEY
My wife and my daughter and the money.
I'll bring the disks to the mall by the
freeway, you bring my family.
We'll
trade.
HOWELL
Fuck that!
You think I'm crazy?!
TALLEY
I think you got no choice.
Howell thinks about it.
It's a tough call because Talley
might be setting him up, but they're playing even hands--
Talley still has the disks --
HOWELL
Fuck the mall.
You know that motel on
the road west of town?
TALLEY
Yeah.
HOWELL
You got ten minutes.
If you're one
minute late, we won't be here to find.
Talley tosses his phone aside, then drives away --
A graphic identifies our location:
New York City.
The motel floats like an island of light in the middle of
nowhere.
A few cars are scattered throughout the quiet
parking lot --
MIKE RUIZ
is hiding in weeds across from the motel, keeping an eye on
the road for Talley's approaching vehicle.
A radio
transmission crackles quietly --
MANELLI'S VOICE
You see anything?
Ruiz keys the mike --
RUIZ
Not yet.
Talley steps silently behind him and presses his gun to Mike
Ruiz's ear --
LOU BUSTER
Buster is on the dark side of thge parking lot, standing watch
outside the pool of light in the shadows --
Gravel crunches behind him; Buster turns, and --
Talley cracks him across the face with his .45 --
WITH TALLEY
He edges along the perimeter of the parking lot, working as
close as he can to a Fat Man who is leaning against the green
Mustang --
The door to a ground floor room opens, and Glen Howell steps
out.
Talley recognizes Howell from the big gold watch --
HOWELL
(to the Fat Man)
Keep your eyes open.
He should've been
here.
Howell returns to the room.
The Fat Man steps away from the
Mustang, and --
Talley slams into his blindside, using the .45 as a club.
The Fat Man staggers, and Talley wraps an arm around his neck
in a choke hold, running him at the door --
Talley rams the Fat man into the door, knocking it open and
shoving the Fat Man through --
Talley stumbles out of the room and runs to his family.
He
scoops up Jane and Amanda, hugging them tightly as the camera
pulls up and away, rising, leaving this reunited family as
Marion Clewes disappears like a passing thunderhead --
CLOSING CREDITS
The credits roll to black, then--
The garage door slides up.
Benza backs out in his Mercedes,
then roars to the front door.
He pops the trunk, then gets
out and hurries to the front door.
He sticks his head inside
and calls to his wife --
BENZA
The fucking jet's waiting!
Would you get
your shit out here?!
He picks up two bags from inside the door and brings them to
the car --
AT THE TRUNK
Benza steps behind the raised trunk to put away his bags.
When he steps back around again, a nondescript sedan is
waiting in the drive --
A VOICE
No fuckups allowed.
Gunfire erupts on the quiet ridge above Palm Springs.
FADE OUT
THE END
