      The last rays of a spring sun bounce off the decaying 
      sandstone spire of Christchurch, Spitalfields. And bounce 
      back again to the heavens. Where they belong. Because they 
      don t belong where we re going...

      Down here. Leman Street. The axis of our world. The unholy 
      chaos of it. Napthalights being lit for the night, flares 
      bouncing off the glass windows of horse-drawn omnibuses. Kids 
      - untamed, running wild. Drunks hanging off tarts. A wild 
      mass of humanity. And a dateline:

      APRIL 1889. EAST LONDON.


      TIGHT on the purple, veined face of this TOUR GUIDE. A man in 
      his early 50s, attempting gentility --

                                    GUIDE
                      Ladies. Gentlemen. Be sure to look 
                    down as keenly as you would up. Mr. 
                      Gladstone himself - only last week - 
                    found himself fitted for new boots.

      And he laughs unpleasantly. Turns away into a small alleyway 
      as a group of perhaps 15 WELL-TO-DO MEN AND WOMEN follow on. 
      All obey the instruction to avoid the various forms of shit
      and matter on the cobbles beneath them.

                                    GUIDE (CONT D)
                      Miller s Court. Five months  past - 
                    the scene of the worst of them. The 
                    worst and - please God - the last. 
                    Mary Jane Kelly. What the man Jack 
                    did to her... well, we shall not 
                    say.

      The MEN and WOMEN gawk - a visceral chill running through 
      them.

      Behind them another group building up. LOCALS, themselves 
      gawking at the fine clothes and hats of the tour group. Among 
      them - a number of SMALL BOYS.

                                    GUIDE (CONT D)
                    But let us not dwell.

      The GUIDE moving on again, turning through a narrow archway. 
      Above and around them various lodging houses. From their 
      windows, several TARTS look out. Much laughter as a gap-
      toothed HAG lifts her skirts for a young CHURCHMAN. 

                                    GUIDE (CONT D)
                    Rents here are paid by the day. I 
                      believe that is all you need know.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/122.


      Pick out - A BOY PICKPOCKET, perhaps 10, catching the eye of 
      the GUIDE. Collusion here. The barest of nods exchanged as 
      the BOY makes his move toward a particular COUPLE. In a 
      footstep, he s relieved the entirely innocent GENTLEMAN of 
      his wallet.

                                    GUIDE (CONT D)
                          (all outrage)
                      I say! You, boy!

      And in a deft step or two, the GUIDE lays a meaty fist on the 
      collar of the escaping boy, takes back the wallet in triumph. 
      Holds it aloft.

                                    GUIDE (CONT D)
                      Gentlemen. Please. Vigilance is 
                    your only guardian on these - mean 
                    and wicked pathways.

      The BOY and the GUIDE - another barely visible moment of 
      complicity as the child stamps on a foot --

                                    GUIDE (CONT D)
                          (all theatre)
                      Wretch! Ruffian!

      But the BOY - a smile on his face - is gone.


      Stay with the BOY as he runs. Fast, agile, a left, a right. 
      And then he careers to a halt. Sudden, real fear on his face. 
      Stood above him --

      A man. All we see - his looming black GREATCOAT. And the DEAD 
      BODY at his feet. What was once a young woman, wrapped in 
      drapes, her throat cut, her face sliced, disfigured. 

      The GREATCOAT - disturbed from his work perhaps - advancing 
      on the appalled child as --

                                    GUIDE (O.S.)
                    ... theyoung of this parish know 
                      little else but thuggery...

      The grateful BOY - his skin surely saved by this 
        interruption, taking off and away. The GREATCOAT no choice 
      but to scarper too.

      And here is the TOUR GROUP again, turning blithely into the 
      alleyway --

                                    GUIDE (CONT D)
                    ... howbest to raise them up from 
                    such iniquity? That is a matter for 
                    you good people, of course...                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/123.


      But he has not seen what lies beneath him. That privilege 
      belongs to an OLDER WOMAN. Her utter disgust at the profane 
      sight of the body, and she SCREAMS.

      The GUIDE - seeing what the WOMAN sees --

                                    GUIDE (CONT D)
                    Black shitand buggery.
                          (then; bellowing)
                      Murder! Murder!

        TITLES1/41/4

      Those screams and bellows mixing into music. Urgent, 
        orchestral, onward-moving. 

      And images - archive photographs, drawings, press-cuttings - 
      of serious, whiskered, hard-looking POLICEMEN about their 
      business. They clobber FELONS, hold back MOBS, drink outside 
      pubs.

      And they are all gathered now about the imposing Victorian 
      frontage of the Leman Street Headquarters of H Division. 

      Over which, letters form now. The legend:


      RIPPER STREET.


      A YOUNG MAN (HOBBS, 19) - a police constable in uniform. And 
      he is sprinting across wet dark cobbles. Coated in sweat, his 
      chest heaves, at the limits of his endurance. And his face - 
      almost a boy s face - is the picture of fear and anxiety. 
      Still he runs, keening with exertion.

      Clattering around a corner now. Sees what he s looking for: 3 
      other COPPERS in uniform, gathered, hidden in an alleyway 
      about a Black Maria (police-wagon).

      HOBBS - almost collapsing into the arms of an older COPPER --

                                    HOBBS
                          (can barely speak)
                    The Inspector... Must... see him...

      COPPER dismisses this notion with a laugh --

                                    COPPER 1
                    Show yourself in there - he ll have 
                    you bounced and flushing sewerage 
                    by morning.

      HOBBS won t listen though. Just hands his helmet across and 
      strips rapidly to undershirt and trousers.                         Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/124.


      A look for the COPPER and he s striding away, disappearing 
      into the darkness...


      The Black Maria - flying through nighttime streets. Inside - 
      those three uniformed COPPERS. And with them - REID. Urgently 
      addressing his men as they travel --

                                    REID
                    Like as not, word will have spread. 
                    We find a mob there - you follow 
                    the Sergeant.

      And looking now to the boxer DRAKE - towelling the sweat from 
      his body throwing his jacket on. Around his waist he slings a 
      chain, vicious billy club attached to the end of it --

                                    DRAKE
                      They ll do their duty, sir.


      The sounds of a seething MOB - gathered at one end of a now 
      sealed street. Rage and fear in equal measure. DRAKE and the 
      other COPPERS barely manage to hold it all back.

      Beyond them a courtyard at the end of the street that is 
      signalled and illuminated for us by a series of phosphorous 
      flashes. 

      Reveal the source of that strange light - the insect-like 
      shape of a PHOTOGRAPHER, a tripod camera, and the stamen of 
      his flash gun raised high.

      Reid, lantern in front of him, stops - despite everything, 
      the machine fixates him. A moments wonder as the gun FLASHES. 
      And reveals the bundle of drapes and flesh that was once a 
      young woman.

                                    REID
                    You.

      The photographer - CECIL CREIGHTON (50s, pale, bespectacled, 
        unimpressive whiskers) - turning to Reid, who still must 
      shout above the clamourof the mob --                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/127.


                                    REID (CONT D)
                    Name.

                                    CREIGHTON
                      Creighton.

                                    REID
                      Creighton - have you touched 
                      anything? Arranged matters to your 
                      benefit in anyway?

                                    CREIGHTON
                    No, sir.

      REID - stepping slowly, his lantern in front of him, lighting 
      the ground beneath, his eyes keen, focussed as he approaches 
      the body. Moves the light over the corpse. The things he 
      doesn t want to see are the things he sees --

      Her cut throat. Slits cut into her eyelids, small stars 
      carved into her flesh and forehead.

      REID - the clear dismay on his face at the sight of this. 
      Turns to CREIGHTON --

                                    REID
                    Who is it s paid for your time 
                    here?

                                    CREIGHTON
                    The Star, Inspector. Who else?

                                    REID
                    Well - you re on my ticket now. I 
                    want these details - her face, her 
                    eyes, her throat.

      CREIGHTON - nothing to be said. He nods, goes to it, as REID 
      steps back. He scans the cobbles all about --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                          (to himself)
                    No pooling of blood. She wasn t cut 
                    here.

      He looks up - the sound of the mob baying from the streets at 
      one end of the courtyard, a small alleyway.

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    Then where was she brought in?

      He walks slowly, swinging the lantern before him, working the 
      scene with the little light available. Disturbed now by the 
      sound of a pair of heels clattering into the courtyard.

      It s DRAKE, and he looks worried --                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/128.


                                    DRAKE
                    Sir. We can t keep  em penned much 
                      longer.

                                    REID
                          (of the area around him)
                    But this is vital. All of it.
                          (the lantern)
                    And this is next to useless.
                          (beat)
                      I need this place uncorrupted and 
                    in daylight.

      But DRAKE is distracted by something. His eyes move beyond 
      REID, to the wall behind, only now lit by his own lantern 
      glow --

                                    REID (CONT D)(cont d)
                    What is it?

                                    DRAKE
                    The wall. He s left word again.

      REID turns, his light thrown ahead of him. Both men aghast at 
      what they see. On the wall - thick, ill-formed letters. But 
      the message entirely clear.

      DOWN ON WHORES.

                                    REID
                          (almost a plea, this)
                      I need more time with her. 

                                    DRAKE
                    Sir. There s the way things are and 
                    the way they should be, but that 
                    lot are coming through...

      REID - a contained fury. Knows there s nothing for it --

                                    REID
                    Then we have to move her. Get the 
                    Maria brought through.

      DRAKE - on it immediately. Turns back to the crowds. REID - 
      turning to CREIGHTON --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    You. You re not finished. I want 
                    the cobbles - running in all 
                      directions away from her. As many 
                    as you can get. The wall, that 
                      writing too. Understand?

      CREIGHTON does, steps away as REID crouches to the body --                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/129.


                                    REID (CONT D)
                          (to himself)
                    Come on, boy.

      And - Creighton s phosphorous flashes going off behind him - 
      he places his arms beneath the drapes and the body. Searches 
      for strength. Lifts. And as he does, a pain (that we won t 
      understand yet) shoots through the left side of his torso and 
      he grimaces, steals himself against it...


      The COPPERS - still somehow holding back the crowd. But the 
      MOB Sfever is intensified now by the sight of REID emerging 
      from the courtyard, that burden in his arms. 

      But here s DRAKE - riding the Black Maria, whipping the 
      horses through, driving the crowds aside to screams of 
      objection. One DRUNK tries to clamber aboard, but a lash of 
      DRAKE S whip opens his cheek and sends him back into the 
      scrum.

      DRAKE - jumping from the carriage, a concern on his face as 
      he goes to him --

                                    DRAKE
                    Here, Mr. Reid. Give her to me.

      REID does just that. Watches as DRAKE effortlessly places the 
      bundle of ex-human in the carriage. He breathes, extends his 
      left shoulder. And now has to contend with --

                                    BEST (O.S.)
                          (a shout)
                      A comment for The Star, Inspector! 
                    Is it him? Is it Jack?

      The crowd, hearing the name. The hysteria. The shouts of 
       Ripper!  and He s back! .

      REID - turning to the owner of that voice --

      FREDERICK BEST - 30s, aspires to the dandy, though neither 
      his looks or his ancestry are helpful in this matter. His 
      thumbs jammed into the pockets of his yellow waistcoat, his 
      mood is entirely at odds with the febrile mob. He could be at 
      a Sunday fair.

      REID - an ugly look for BEST, then he ignores the man. Climbs 
      up to join Drake.

      BEST - he hasn t got as far as he has by being this easily 
      dismissed. He pushes his way through the baying mob, shouts 
      up to REID --

                                    BEST (CONT D)
                    These citizens need their questions 
                      answered, Mr. Reid.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1210.


      REID - leaning down. Right into BEST S face --

                                    REID
                          (steel)
                    No. They need their fears pacified.

      And he pushes the reporter away.

                                    REID (CONT D)
                          (to DRAKE)
                    Go!

      And away DRAKE takes them. The carriage clattering back 
      through the incensed crowd and away into the night.

      BEST - a grin on his face, at the forefront of this ever more 
      incensed mob, crying out above the tumult --

                                    BEST
                    And where would be the sport in 
                      that!?


      REID and DRAKE atop the flying carriage --

                                    DRAKE
                    Where are we taking her? The 
                      London? Mr. Bagster-Philipps ?

                                    REID
                    No. No hospitals; no Met surgeons. 
                      They ll all talk.
                          (beat)
                    You take her back to LemanStreet. 
                    Use the back. Find a cell and lock 
                    her in it. You don t book her in; 
                    and Sergeant - you tell no one.

                                    DRAKE
                    And yourself, Mr. Reid?

      REID - eyeing DRAKE --

                                    DRAKE(CONT D)
                    Sir. Not the American.

      REID - ignores the protest; jumps to the street.

                                    REID
                    Just get her hid.


      Establish this exterior. The seemingly unremarkable facade of 
      this well appointed house on a quieter street.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1211.



      Gaslight illuminates the soot-black walls of this - our 
      precinct headquarters. A tide of humanity sweeps in and out 
      beneath the sign POLICE.

                                    JACKSON
                    You going to tell me what this is 
                      about?

                                    REID
                    Just keep walking.

      And Reid leads him through.


      An ugly, subterranean basement. A steel door and padlock. 
      Which Reid now hammers upon --

                                    REID
                      Creighton! Open up.

        OMITTED1/201/20


      DRAKE and JACKSON exchange looks again. 

                                    ABBERLINE (O.S.)
                      A Pinkerton?

                                    REID (O.S.)
                      That s right.

                                    ABBERLINE (O.S.)
                      A chartered mercenary with a badge.
                          (beat)
                    An ocean between him and his 
                      rightful manor...

      JACKSON shrugs. Examines a fingernail.


      Although not sure where we are yet. A tidy, modest home. And - 
      O/S - the growing sounds of a man and woman in congress.


      The sounds of a railway engine departing. Smoke in the air 
      perhaps.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1231.


      And Reid and Drake - turning out on to this wide street.

                                    DRAKE
                    It s the call to send them 
                      underground that troubles me, sir. 
                    Seems unnatural.

                                    REID
                    Well - they re building more. More 
                      trains, digging more tunnels. It 
                    means the city can spread out - and 
                    we can stop living like rats.

      Drake - looking around him. The trees, the grass. Genteel, *
      peaceful, entirely to be desired. 

                                    DRAKE
                    What? And come live on these 
                      streets?

                                    REID
                    Would you like that, Bennet?

                                    DRAKE
                          (may as well walk on 
                            water)
                    I d like many things, sir.

      REID - a sad little smile for that. And on they walk. Until --

                                    DRAKE
                    Left here. Number 42.

      Left they turn. REID, noticing an impressive coach parked *
      opposite - two black horses, plumage, a coachman. On they go, *
      past small but tended front gardens. Down a pathway. To a *
      door that s hanging open...

      REID - casting DRAKE a curious look, calling out --

                                    REID
                    Mr. Thwaites, sir? It s the police.

      From inside - a clattering, a crash of something being turned 
      over. REID and DRAKE on the move.

      I/E. THWAITES HOUSE -DAY 21/451/45*

      A pair of boots - suspended mid-air, thrashing. A CHAIR *
      KICKED OVERbeside them. Above - A MAN in his 30s(CHRISTIAN *
      THWAITES), hanged by rope from a high ceiling,his face puce *
      and distorted, CHOKING. Desperate hands clawing at the rope *
      about his throat.*

      REID - to the man in an instant, his shoulder forgotten. 
      Thrusting the legs upwards. But - from the interior of the *
      house. Another NOISE, a CRASHING.*                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1232.


      And Drake is racing through in an instant. Sees --*

      The window bust open and two GREATCOATS sprinting away across *
      the front garden and boarding that coach, its door held open *
      by THIS MAN- 30s, aristocratic, saturnine. DONALDSON. He *
      meets Drake s eye - the briefest moment. And the coach is *
      gone.*

      Drake - every instinct in him willing to give chase, but --*

                                    REID (O.S.)*
                      Drake! With me! I cannot hold him.*

      Thwarted for now, he turns back in. *

      Sees REID - grimacing with the weight of the struggling man --*

                                    REID*
                    Your knife!*

      Drake - producing a blade from the inside of his coat. Moves *
      to them.*

        OMITTED1/471/47*


      JACKSON and ROSE - turning out into this day-lit courtyard. 
      And a strange space it is too. Flats mocked up to present a 
      different period of antiquity. Mediaeval England; hanging 
      gardens of Babylon; ancient Greece.

      In the corner - two MEN and a WOMAN smoking, resting glasses 
      of gin on what looks like some kind of LARGE WOODEN CABINET 
      on wheels (we ll come back to this). They nod a hello for 
      JACKSON and ROSE --                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1237.


                                    JACKSON
                    Don t you all catch cold out here?

                                    ROSE
                      Wouldn t know. Never been here 
                      before.

      And they turn to leave. Back through into the warehouse. 
      Heading for the stairs. Where JACKSON stops by a large waste 
      paper container. Has a quick rifle through it all. Cast-offs, 
        over-exposures, that kind of thing. But something takes his 
      eye. The image is over-exposed, useless - but there are 
      figures discernible in it. Naked flesh; a man s hand clasping 
      a buttock. Jackson s eyes go wide. He pockets the image.


      Swooping in hard and low down the river. Heading for this 
      same warehouse. The sounds of a bedlam building.


      Donaldson - a measured pace about him. Climbing into his 
      carriage, and a word for his Coachman --

                                    DONALDSON
                    Best make haste, Tucker.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      Reid - great hope, great urgency. Descending on this 
      carriage. Ripping the door open to reveal --

        A TERRIFIED MOUSTACHED TOFF. But not the Moustached Toffhe 
      wants. 

      Reid slams the door. Spins. And sees --

      A pack of SIMILAR CARRIAGES disappearing into the night.

      He screams in frustration.


      CREIGHTON - taking up that sledgehammer, sliding it through 
      the brackets of the steel door. And calmly walking away.


      KABOOM!!!!

      That sledgehammer flies back. The door is wrenched, bent and 
      sheared apart. But there is a hole. 

      I/E. CREIGHTON HOME - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS1/711/71

      Oxygen rushing into the basement. Fire exploding with it. 
      REID, JACKSON and DRAKE - fighting through it. DRAKE - first 
      through. Wrenching that hole wider. Reaching for REID. 
      Pulling him out.

      And here s JACKSON looking out at him. Flames, his outreached 
      hands, needs his help.

      DRAKE - holding for the briefest of moments; just enough to 
      strike mortal fear into JACKSON --

                                    JACKSON
                    Come on! I was joking, Drake. A bad 
                    habit I ve developed for men who 
                      intimidate me!

      DRAKE - a broad smile all of a sudden. Reaching through and 
      dragging the American into the safety of the night air.


      LONG SUSAN - escorting ROSE and two other GIRLS through the 
      doorway, out on to the street, where --

      A large coach waits for them - 2 black horses, black plumage, 
      a new carriage door. And strapped to its roof - a LARGE 
      WOODEN CABINET; the same cabinet that the more observant 
      amongst us will remember from the porn studio.

      ROSE, MYRTLE, a couple of other GIRLS. Taken by the luxury of 
      the carriage. By the sight of the COACHMAN handing a large 
      bundle of cash to Susan; and a blindfold to each girl.

                                    COACHMAN
                    His Lordship would preserve his 
                      anonymity a while longer.

      Rose - a look for Susan, who offers a reassuring nod in 
      return. So she and the others blind themselves. Allow the 
      Coachman to help them aboard. 


      Our three heroes - their blackened faces, smoking cigarettes, 
      sat on the opposing sidewalk to the smoking building. A 
      frightened collection of CREIGHTON S NEIGHBOURS in their 
      nightwear looking on. After a moment --

                                    JACKSON
                    What now?

      REID - taking his time, removing from his pockets that strip 
      of film. He holds it up to the light of the flames - sees the 
      image of the caged bird flickering away --

                                    REID
                    See the way the images look 
                      identical, but by the end of the 
                      sequence the bird sits in a 
                      different position...

      JACKSON - a nod. And REID - standing now --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                      There s a man - A Frenchman, Le 
                      Prince. An engineer. He has - 
                      experimented with photographic 
                      images that...
                          (a bald statement of fact)
                    ... move.

                                    JACKSON
                    Like a lantern show?

                                    REID
                    No. Real. It s why the pictures 
                      appear of a kind - because every 
                      degree of muscular movement must be 
                      captured in one moment of 
                      precision. The end effect, 
                      therefore - a fluid movement.

                                  REID (cont'd)
                          (a wonder in him now)
                    The precise details of our lives 
                      caught and re-presented to others.

      REID - another thought. Producing now the singed and curled 
      portraits of Donaldson and Maude Thwaites doing extraordinary 
      things to each other. Hands them to JACKSON and DRAKE --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                      Imagine you could get theseto 
                    move? To be real?
                          (beat)
                    See the leash...


      The film. DONALDSON and MAUDE - abstracted images of their 
      sex. A leash placed about her neck...


                                    REID (CONT D)
                          (to JACKSON)
                      Enough - in a moment of grotesque 
                      passion to...

      And he wrenches with his two hands. Snap.

                                    JACKSON
                      A misadventure.

      REID - this his most urgent anxiety --

                                    REID
                    And what if that entire moment had 
                    been captured by this new camera.

      DRAKE - aghast at the idea --

                                    DRAKE
                    You d destroy it; as he attempted.

                                    REID
                      I don t agree. Not these men. 
                      Creighton is more than a peeper. 
                    One look at his darkroom should 
                    tell you he s an - experimentalist, 
                      however misguided, a man of 
                      science. 
                          (the image of DONALDSON)
                    And this man? Corrupt and evil? 
                      Absolutely. But in his way - 
                      equally progressive.
                            (another beat)
                    If this thing exists - they d 
                      celebrate it.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1255.


                                    JACKSON
                    In the right circles - it would 
                    make them a mint.

                                    DRAKE
                    Then they d make more.

      REID - the same ghastly thought has taken root in him as 
      well. He jabs at DONALDSON S ghoulish likeness --

                                    REID
                    This man. We have to find this man.

      OMITTED. CONTENT MOVED TO 1/811/771/77

1/781/78I/E. LEMAN STREET - BOOKING OFFICE - DAY 

      Broad shoulders and a dark suit, mounting the Leman Street 
      steps and throwing the doors open.

      Abberline - striding through the booking office toward where 
      Artherton, rook-like, sits at the dock --

                                    ABBERLINE
                      Artherton. I ve come for her.
                          (beat)
                      Where s Reid.

      Artherton - a look for Abberline. Jerks his thumb away --

                                    ARTHERTON
                    The Inspector addresses his men.

      Abberline - returning that look, passing on through. 


      Carriages waiting. DRAKE and a phalanx of UNIFORMS assembled. 
      And REID and ABBERLINE stood apart and alone.

      ABBERLINE - he s stiff, brings forth the information with the 
      discomfort of a man who knows he s proved wrong --

                                    ABBERLINE
                      Summer  86. 
                          (beat)
                      Before your time here.
                            (another beat)
                    He got his cock out at a church 
                      picnic in Victoria Park. Week or 
                    two later, tore the blouse off a 
                      pregnant woman on the Stepney 
                      Omnibus. Charged him but - man from 
                    such a family... as like to do Jug 
                    as Victoria herself.
                          (beat)
                    The address is all we ever had for 
                    him.

      REID -  he knows what it is the man had given up here. Lays a 
      hand on his shoulder --

                                    REID
                    Thank you, Fred.

                                    ABBERLINE
                    Go.

      REID nods. Withdraws his hand, turns to join DRAKE and the 
      UNIFORMS as they board the carriages and tear-arseaway.

      ABBERLINE - watching them go. A sudden sadness in him - he 
      has one look for the frontage of his old shop, then he s 
      turning away, his impeccable black suit disappearing into the 
        free-for-all of the streets.


      ROSE - her eyes adjusting to the bright light. Of DONALDSON 
      above her, his knees pinning her to the terrace. In his hand - 
      a vial of some kind, the liquid inside --

                                    DONALDSON (CONT D)
                    This will calm you.

      And he forces her jaw apart. Pours it into her.


      REID, DRAKE and JACKSON - running through the carnival mayhem 
      of Whitechapel. The wonder of the whole neighbourhood passing 
      by until --

      They turn into this quiet, deserted street. All the houses 
      about them derelict, run-down. Including the one at the end 
      of the street outside which - two GREATCOATS stand sentry.

                                    REID
                    Slow now.

      The three - slow purposeful strides toward the house. But - 
      as they draw near - the GREATCOATS are taking no chances. 
      Bring up a heavy SHOTGUN each. Aim and...

      JACKSON - the swiftest of moves. Two COLT .45sproduced and 
      unleashed. Two GREATCOATS spinning DEAD into the gutter.

      REID and DRAKE - twin looks of amazement to JACKSON, who just 
      shrugs, moves on.


      CREIGHTON and his BOX - set up outside now. He has his dry-
      plate camera too. Takes a photograph as - DONALDSON and ROSE 
      emerge from within dressed in that Egyptian finery. Take 
      their place against this backdrop of ancient Egypt.

      ROSE - all fight gone from her; entirely stoned. Her 
      desperate eyes swim to Creighton. Plead to him.

      But, Creighton - his fear, his shame - cannot meet them. 
      Attends to his business.


      CREIGHTON crouched over his camera, turning the handle, 
      filming - DONALDSON, on his knees, and ROSE, entirely blank, 
      astride him. His hands around her throat, her last breath is 
      upon her. DONALDSON - his mad eyes turning to see --

      DRAKE - first through the door, instant, appalled rage at 
      what he sees. Three easy steps to the man. Burying the 
      regimental sword in DONALDSON S skull.

      DRAKE - he keeps on moving, drops the sword and catches ROSE 
      as she falls. Sweeps her off and away, covering her up, 
      taking her back indoors past a concerned JACKSON.

      CREIGHTON - staggered by this sudden violence. Steps away 
      from the advancing REID --

                                    REID
                      Whatever happens, whatever 
                      punishment is seen fit for - all 
                      this...
                          (of the camera)
                    It is extraordinary.

      CREIGHTON - the machine on castors, backing away with it. His  
      hand reaching inside. Releasing film. Winding it about his 
      arm --

                                    CREIGHTON
                      I knew you were a man to appreciate 
                    such things.

      And he clutches the machine tight. Uses one hand to reach for  
      the lighter in his pocket.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1264.


                                    REID
                    No.

      Too late. CREIGHTON flicks once, flicks twice. And lights the 
      film. Up they go. Man, film, camera - swallowed by 
        incandescent flame.

      Reid and Jackson - no choice but to watch them burn.


      REID keeps walking. Out the pub, back into the clamourof the 
      streets. His streets, his manor. Striding on.
