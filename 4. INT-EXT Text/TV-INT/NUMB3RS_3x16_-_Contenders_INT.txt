      TWO FIGHTERS IN HEADGEAR circle each other in the ring. BEN 
      ELLIS (black, 32). PETE MUNSON (white, 28). Sparring while 
      MUSIC PLAYS. Until Ellis shoots off a combination; Munson 
      blocks the first punch. Takes the second on the chin.

                                  COACH
                          (yelling instructions)
                    Come on, Pete. Watch the left.


      ELLIS STINGS MUNSON WITH ANOTHER LEFT. Then another... Coach 
      jumps into the ring.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Stop! Stop! Hold up.
                          (to Ellis)

                    What the hell's wrong with you? 
                    You're a sparring partner.
                          (then to Munson)

                    You okay?


      MUNSON SHAKES his head... Then his LEGS BUCKLE underneath 
      him. He falls hard. His body CONVULSES gently. Then falls 

      DEADLY STILL.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Pete. Come on.

      Coach checks for a pulse.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                          (panic)

                    There's no pulse.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Three sixes.  Beat that.

      Amita puts down her cards.

                                  AMITA
                    Flush. All hearts.

                                    CHARLIE
                    But... you should have folded.

                                  AMITA
                    I was feeling lucky.

                                    CHARLIE
                    There was a less than 18 percent 
                      probability you'd complete the 
                    flush.  You really should have-you 
                    should have folded.

      She pulls the pile of chips towards her.

                                  AMITA
                    Charlie, how long are we gonna play 
                    poker?

                                    CHARLIE
                    The Texas Hold'em tournament s 
                    coming up--

                                  AMITA
                    I know, and you promised Larry that 
                    you would defend his title.

                                    CHARLIE
                    That s right. Against Professor 
                    Novich.

                                  AMITA
                    Who's practically a professional 
                    poker player....

                                    CHARLIE
                    He's a big jerk.

                                  AMITA
                    But your father is out of town for 
                    the weekend...

      Amita leans into Charlie...

                    ...and we have the house all to 
                      ourselves.

      She whispers something in Charlie's ear... They kiss 
      passionately.

      THE DOORBELL RINGS.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Wait.  Hold that thought. That's 
                    dinner.

      They kiss again. Charlie reaches for his WALLET.

                                  ALAN (O.S.)
                    No, that s okay.  I ll take it from 
                    here.  Thank you.  Uh...

      ALAN enters, holding CHINESE FOOD from a delivery.

                                    CHARLIE 
                    Dad.

      Amita pulls her robe closed.

                                  ALAN
                    I caught the delivery boy at the 
                    door. My meeting was over so I 
                    caught the last plane--
                          (looks up)
                    I-I-I think I'm interrupting. I 
                    should... I should leave.


      Charlie and Amita trade a look.

                                  AMITA
                    No, you should have dinner with us. 
                    There's plenty. Charlie always 
                    orders too much food anyway.

                                  ALAN
                      Really...because I m starving.

      Off Charlie,

                    The Larson Homicide?

      The patrolman points out DET. GRAHAM LARSON, 30 s.

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    David Sinclair, FBI. I got your 
                    call.

                                  LARSON
                    One of my suspects dropped your 
                    name. Called you as a courtesy.

                                  DAVID
                    Dropped my name?

                                  LARSON
                    Guy over there. Ben Ellis.

      POV on Ben Ellis talking to another PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE. 

      Ben looks up, sees David. They exchange a look. Then --

                                  LARSON (CONT D)
                    So, you do know this guy?

                                  DAVID
                    Yeah, I know him. What happened?

                                  LARSON
                    How much have you heard about mixed

                                  DAVID
                    It's like kick boxing, with some 
                    judo and stuff...

                                  LARSON
                    Kinda. Anyway... the deceased...

                    Pete Munson, was gearing up for an

                    Ken Bainsworth.

                                  DAVID
                      Qualifying for what?

      David points to the body.

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    You mind if I take a look?

                                  LARSON
                    Go ahead. If he beat Bainsworth, he 
                    was gonna get a shot at the champ.

                                  DAVID
                    And Ellis?

                                  LARSON
                    The training partner. Landed a 
                    punch. Munson gwent down, never 
                    came up.

                                  DAVID
                    Fighter dying in the rign is a 
                    tragedy, but not necessarily a 
                    homicide.

                                  LARSON
                    M.E.'s talking about Munson being 
                    drugged.

                                  DAVID
                    Drugged? With what?

                                  LARSON
                    Won't know until the autopsy.

                                  DAVID
                    Why's Ben a suspect?

                                  LARSON
                    Same thing happened six months ago. 
                    Ben was in a training match in 
                    Vegas. Other fighter, guy named 
                    Octavio Lopez...Also died in the 
                    ring.

                                  DAVID
                    Was Lopez drugged as well?

                                  LARSON
                    We're looking into that now. 
                    Meantime, we're putting together a 
                    list of everyone who was at either 
                    gym the day of each death.


                                  DAVID
                    Mind if I talk to him?

                                  LARSON
                    Be my guest.

      David crosses to Ben. A PATROLMAN brings the COACH to Larson.

                                  DAVID
                    Long time no see.

      A strained beat.

                                  BEN
                    I didn't know who else to call.
                          (then glances over at 
                            Larson)
                    So is it bad?

                                  DAVID
                    Cop says it s a murder.

                                  BEN
                    Murder? I just threw a couple 
                    punches. That's it.

                                  DAVID
                    Is that right?

                                  BEN
                    Yeah, that s it.

                                  DAVID
                    Cop told me about the other fight. 
                    The guy in Vegas.

                                  BEN
                    Look, I got no idea what's going 
                    on. I swear.

      David considers this as Larson approaches,

                                  LARSON
                    Just talked to a witness who says 
                    you threatened Munson earlier 
                    today.

                                  BEN
                    I didn't threaten anybody.

                                  LARSON
                    Then you won't mind giving me a 
                    statement at the station.

      Ben looks at David.

                                  BEN
                    You're arresting me?

                                  LARSON
                    Just wanna hear your side.

                    If you want, Agent Sinclair can be 
                    there.

      David nods and leans in.

                                  DAVID
                    Listen, don't say anything 'til I

      Charlie and Amita, now in jeans and sweatshirts, are at the 
      dining table with Alan AND NOW DON, playing cards, eating 
      Chinese out of the box. Amita PUSHES IN A STACK OF CHIPS.

                                  AMITA
                      Raise...ten.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I m out.

      Don matches the bet. Alan folds, throws in his cards.

                                  ALAN
                    Too rich for me.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Ten dollars is too rich for you?

                                  ALAN
                    Yeah.

      Alan rises, walks to kitchen.

                                  AMITA
                    Unlucky in love...

                    I didn't plan on any of this.

                                  AMITA
                    Charlie, I m kidding. I m having a 
                    great time.

                                  DON
                    Yeah, you re winning.  Of course 
                    you re having fun. I d be having

                    Sorry to bother you so late, but I 
                    kinda wanted to talk to Charlie 
                    about something.

                                  DON
                    Yeah, all right.  Come on in.

                                  DAVID
                    I was actually hoping to talk to 
                    Charlie about something.

      David joins them in the dining room.


                                    CHARLIE
                    What's up, David?

                                  ALAN
                    Hello, David.

                                  DAVID
                    Good evening, Mr. Eppes.  I m sorry 
                    to interrupt you guys.

                                    CHARLIE
                    That s all right.

                                  DAVID
                    I wanted to know if I could get 
                    some help on something. Guy I know 
                    got into a little bit of trouble.

                                  ALAN
                    What kinda trouble?

                                  DAVID
                    He's a mixed-martial arts fighter. 
                    In a sparring session, he threw a 
                      punch...and the other fighter... 
                    died.

                                  AMITA
                    That's awful.

                                  DAVID
                    Gets a little worse. Six months 
                    ago, the same thing happened. 
                    Another sparring session and that 
                    guy died as well.

                                  ALAN
                    Trouble seems to follow your 
                    friend.

                                  DAVID
                    Always has... LAPD thinks the two 
                    fighters could have been drugged.

                                  DON
                    So they're looking at your friend 
                    for this?

                                  DAVID
                    Yeah.

                                    CHARLIE
                    What can I do?

                                  DAVID
                          (takes paper out)
                    I'm hoping you can do something 
                    like what you did with the Syntel 
                      shareholders when the corporate 
                      whistleblower was killed.

                                    CHARLIE
                    So you have a large list of 
                    potential suspects.

                                  DAVID
                    Actually, I have two. This list is 
                    everybody who was at the gum 
                    tonight, and I'm waiting on a 
                    second list to come in from Las 
                    Vegas where the other fighter died.

      David hesitates.

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    I know it s alot, Charlie, but 
                    there s  a lot of overlap, about a 
                    hundred names-- spectators, 
                    trainers, some fighters.

      Alan picks up the cards, shuffles absently.

      ENTER CHARLIE VISION:

      The cards are dealt rapid fire. TWO COUNTERS perform a

                                    CHARLIE
                          (to Amita)
                    What if we construe the 
                      precipitating events of the two 
                    murders as appropriate for a 
                    Kruskal Count.

                                  AMITA
                          (gets it, impressed)
                    That's creative. We look for the 
                    linkages and find any key pattern.

                                    CHARLIE
                    It may help us narrow down the list 
                    to a few key suspects.

                                  ALAN
                    Or maybe just one.
                          (then, to David)
                    I mean, um...your friend.

                                        ACT ONE


55

      Ben Ellis sits opposite Graham Larson. David stands in a 
      corner.

                                  LARSON
                    My witness says you threatened 
                    Munson. Said you'd kill him.

                                  BEN
                    Wasn't like that.

                                  LARSON
                    So you don't deny saying it?

      Beat. Ben hesitates a moment --

                                  DAVID
                    Why don't you tell the detective 
                    what it was like.

      Larson glances over at David.

                                  BEN
                    We were just talking about what 
                    would happen in the ring.  Me and 
                    him.

                                  LARSON
                    And you said you'd kill him.

                                  BEN
                    It's a figure of speech, Detective.

      Larson puts a PHOTO down. Dead Fighter.

                                  LARSON
                    Doesn't look like a figure of 
                    speech to me... Does it look like a 
                    figure of speech to you, Agent 
                    Sinclair?

                                  DAVID
                          (beat)
                    Are you ready to charge him?

                                  LARSON
                          (a little pissed)
                    No. I'm not.

                                  DAVID
                    So he's free to go.

      Larson doesn't like it, but...

                                  LARSON
                    You need to stay in Los Angeles, 
                    Mr. Ellis.

                                  BEN
                    Why?

                                  LARSON
                    Because you're a material witness 
                    in a murder investigation.

      Larson, pretty hot, exits. Ben turns to face David.

                                  DAVID
                    You need to get yourself a lawyer.

                                  BEN
                    So this is how it s going to be?

                                  DAVID
                    Just get yourself a good lawyer, 
                    Ben. If you don't know anybody, 
                    I ll make a phone call--

                                  BEN
                    Shoulda known you'd take their 
                    side.

                                  DAVID
                    I'm down here in the middle of the 
                    night helping you out, am I not?

                                  BEN
                    Yeah. Least that much has changed.

      Ben exits, leaving David shaking his head.

      Don, reads from a FOLDER, finds MEGAN at her desk. COLBY is 
      on the phone.

                                  DON
                    More people watched a mixed-martial 
                    arts fight on pay-per-view than a 
                    baseball playoff game on network 
                    TV?

                                  MEGAN
                    Yeah, this is big business. I saw 
                    Larry Alston on the news the other 
                    night.


                                  DON
                    Who s that?

                                  MEGAN
                    Larry Alston?  He s the guy that 
                    partnered with some big casino 
                    money and bought the All-Out 
                    Fighting League. He's trying to 
                    clean it up, take it mainstream.

                                  DON
                    Yeah, well, this whole thing ain t 
                    gonna help.

                                  MEGAN
                    Yeah.  Neither is losing his 
                    fighter. Not that Munson could've 
                    taken Tino Alva.

                                  DON
                    Who s that?

                                  MEGAN
                    Alva s the AFL's champion.

                                  DON
                    So how do you know all this?

                                  MEGAN
                    The guys I teach Krav Maga to are 
                    way into it. They so excited for 
                    that Alva-Bainsworth rematch. Why 
                    are we looking at this? I thought 
                    this thing with David's friend was 
                    LAPD.

                                  DON
                    Yeah, well, might be two murders in 
                    two states, right? Meanwhile, we re 
                    just play a supporting role for 
                    now.

      Colby hangs up his phone.

                    Just got off with the Vegas M.E.. 
                    They found a heart defect in the 
                    Lopez autopsy. The death was ruled 
                      accidental.

                                  MEGAN
                    So the other fighter wasn't 
                    drugged?

                                  COLBY
                    They stopped looking once they 
                    found the defect, so they re going 
                    to pull an archived tissue sample 
                    and take another look.

                                  DON
                    Alright, meanwhil, Charlie's gonna 
                    need data, so we ll start looking 
                    into their background. Talk to this 
                    guy, Alston.

      Off Don, exaggerated innocence.

                    It disrupts the body's ability to 
                    process oxygen, induces cardiac 
                    arrest. To be honest, I almost

                                    CLAUDIA
                      Agricultural companies, chemical 
                      suppliers, nurseries. It's mostly 
                    used to protect crops from animal 
                    pests. But it's not regulated.

                                  DAVID
                          (re: the body)
                    How was it delivered?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Munson's reaction was localized to 
                    the tissue in his mouth.

                                  DAVID
                    So what? He drank it?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Probably. But LAPD checked all the 
                    water bottles from the gym... they 
                    all came up clean.

                                  DAVID
                          (slight disappointment)
                    So we've got a generic chemical and 
                    no forensics on delivery.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Sorry there's nothing more 
                    specific. You and this suspect old 
                    friends?

                                  DAVID
                    Back in grade school, Ben Ellis and 
                    me and another kid, we were pretty 
                    tight.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    And now?

                                  DAVID
                    Ben and I sorta drifted apart after 
                    high school.  You know how it is.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    What about the other kid?

      A beat. David focused on a memory, then quickly,

                                  DAVID
                    Earl s dead.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Sorry.

      They share a moment.

                                  DAVID
                    Thank you.

      He leaves.

      Charlie and Amita are working on the TWO LISTS. Amita surveys 
      the boards.

                                  AMITA
                    Tough to determine linkages when 
                    these two have almost nothing in 
                    common.

                                    CHARLIE
                    The first fighter killed, Octavio 
                    Lopez, is Hispanic, from Colorado. 
                    The other, Pete Munson, is a white 
                    guy from Wisconsin.

                                  AMITA 
                    Fighting seems to be the only point 
                    in common.

      Charlie looks at the board. Scribbles computations on a 
      YELLOW PAD. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    That's it.

                                  AMITA
                    What's it?

                    The common link is fighting. Look 
                    at these fight histories.

      He hands Amita the yellow pad.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    I'd have to assume the motive in 
                    both deaths involves the fighters' 
                    rankings.

      Amita scribbles into the pad. Looks up, winces.

                    David's friend, Ben Ellis... With 
                    Lopez and Munson out of the way, he 
                    moves to the top of the list.

      PROFESSOR STANLEY NOVICH ENTERS.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Stanley, you're a long way from the 
                    Bio-Chem Department. Amita, you 
                    remember Professor Novich.

                                  NOVICH
                    I hear you're taking Fleinhardt's 
                    seat in the Texas Hold'em 
                      tournament.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I am considering it, yes.

                                  NOVICH
                    You should think again. With 
                      Fleinhardt in space, I'm in line 
                    for the title.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I don't think it works that way, 
                    but okay.

                                  NOVICH
                    I've seen your game, Eppes. Won't 
                    make it at the big table.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I think you'll find my game is 
                    vastly improved.

      Charlie pats his LAPTOP, closes it.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I wrote a specialized training

                    What that was, was totally 
                      inappropriate. Novich is way out of

                    Charlie, come on. He's trying to

      Off Charlie, looking agitated, not ignoring him.

      LARRY ALSTON stands with Don. Colby takes in a POSTER OF TINO 
      ALVA, THE CHAMP, and another, ALVA VERSUS KEN BAINSWORTH 
      (PRODUCTION NOTE: From a fight 3 years prior), on the wall.

                                  COLBY
                    So, Tino Alva, he s been the AFL 
                    champion for a while, right? 

                                  ALSTON
                    Alva's 22 and 1. Hasn't lost a 
                    fight since he took the title away 
                    from Bainsworth.


                                  DON
                    So what s the deal?  This guy Pete 
                    Munson was his next opponent?

                    the Qualifier.
                          (beat)
                    Pete had real promise. And you get
                    past the tattoos, he was a good 
                    kid. Charismatic... A college 
                    degree. Our sport isn't as brutal 
                    as it looks. His death is an

                    How about Octavio Lopez?  His death

                          (off Alston's confusion)
                    We're also looking into his death 
                    as well.

                                  ALSTON

                    Look, we're in the middle of filing 
                      a petition to the State Athletic 
                      Commission. We're trying to put our

      We're back at the training gym. David enters, finds Larson 
      amidst the FORENSIC TEAM sweeping the area.

                    Examiner on Lopez came back 
                    positive for 1080 poison. I wanted

      They walk towards the lockers at the back of the gym.

      Larson and David follow him back through the door. Larson and

                    That's your friend's locker and gym

                    That's 1080.

1313

      Colby and David enter. Find Don, waiting.

                                  DON
                    I just heard from this homicide 
                      detective. What s going on?

                                  COLBY
                    Ellis got away.

                                  DON
                    Yeah, I know that.

                                  DAVID
                    Was my fault.

                                  DON
                    What s going on, David?  Is it too 
                    much?

                                  COLBY

                    Wasn't anybody's fault. And we're 
                    on it. We ve got pictures at the 
                    airport, we re monitoring his 
                    credit cards.

                                  DAVID
                    We caught him with the credit card 
                    once. He won't make the same 
                    mistake.

                                  DON
                    So, where will he go?

                                  DAVID
                    He's got no immediate family in 
                    L.A.... But we might have a few 
                    mutual friends out here. We could 
                    pull his phone records.

                                  DON
                    Do it.

      Charlie and Amita stand outside Charlie's office.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You said, "Just ignore him."

                                  AMITA
                      Obviously, I didn't see this 
                    coming.

      REVEAL Charlie's office door. COVERED IN PLASTIC, CORDONED 
      OFF WITH HAZ-MAT TAPE/SIGNS AND A CONTAMINATION REPORT. 
      Inside, A GUY IN A HAZ-MAT SUIT blows SMOKE.

                                  AMITA (CONT D)
                    Novich is a world authority on 
                    animal defense mechanisms.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (reading the REPORT)
                    And it says my office is 
                      contaminated with a strain of 
                      thioacetate.

                                  AMITA
                    That's the stuff that gives skunk 
                    spray its smell.

                                    CHARLIE
                    This says they have to run tests to 
                    determine the level of toxicity.

                                  AMITA
                    When will that be?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Three or four days minimum.
                          (then, realizing)
                    My laptop's in there. I can't get 
                    to my poker training program.

      Colby arrives with TWO FOLDERS, takes in the door.

                                  COLBY
                      Hi...What's happened here? 

                                    CHARLIE
                    I don't want to talk about it. Is 
                    that the information on Ben Ellis?

                                  COLBY
                    What is that smell?

                                  AMITA
                            (snickering)
                    He got skunked.

      Colby hands Charlie folder #1. Charlie opens it.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Is he familiar with the Los Angeles 
                    area?


                                  COLBY
                    He fights out of New York. He's 
                    only been here about a month, for 
                    training.

                                  AMITA
                    Ellis' knowledge of the area gives 
                    us a prior distribution on his 
                    location. We start with his 
                    training regimen, who he works 
                    with, who he knows...

      Charlie has a thought, seems to regret expressing it.

                                    CHARLIE
                    And we should also factor in anyone 
                    David knows from their old 
                      neighborhood who's now in Los 
                    Angeles. If they're old friends, 
                    Ben's escape route might go through 
                    points in common.

                                  COLBY
                          (hands over folder #2)
                    Exactly what David thought.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Good.

      Off the man in the hazmat suit spraying...

      David crosses, finds Megan at her desk, looking at a PHOTO of 
      Ben Ellis; PHOTO of Pete Munson.

                                  MEGAN
                    You knew this guy, Ben Ellis, 
                    pretty well...

                                  DAVID
                    Something on your mind?

                                  MEGAN
                    You think he's really capable of a 
                    double murder?

                                  DAVID
                    These murders do move him to the 
                    top of the rankings. But I'm 
                    sensing maybe you don't think he 
                    fits the profile.

                                  MEGAN
                    I think our killer has to be 
                      methodical, calculating. These 
                    murders were planned out in 
                    advance.

                                  DAVID
                    Ben did two years in a Youth 
                      Correctional Facility. You know 
                    what those places can turn you 
                    into.

                                  MEGAN
                    What did he do?

      David thinks a beat, conjuring the memory.

                                  DAVID
                    Three of us went to a movie-- me, 
                    Ben Ellis and another kid...Earl 
                    Day. Afterwards, I went home, but 
                    Ben and Earl went to hang out at 
                    Earl's lady over at this burger 
                    spot she worked at. Ben got into it 
                    with some guy over there-- as 
                    usual. Gun came out. Earl was 
                    killed.


                                  MEGAN
                    And you blame Ben.

                                  DAVID
                    So did the state of New York.


      Off Megan,

      Charlie is in the living room with FIVE OR SIX GRADUATE 
      STUDENTS. There's a CHALKBOARD from the garage. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    I think with that we'll call it a 
                    night. And thanks again for dealing 
                    with the venue change.

      Alan enters through the front door. Is a little surprised by 
      the parade of STUDENTS exiting.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Hey, Dad.  This is my graduate 
                    harmonic analysis seminar.

                                  ALAN
                    In our living room.

                                    CHARLIE
                    We usually meet in my office, but 
                    I'm kinda "locked out" at the 
                    moment.

                                  ALAN
                    Why are you locked out of your 
                    office?

                                    CHARLIE
                    It's a long story.

                                  ALAN
                    Okay.

      Alan heads toward the kitchen.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (now eager)
                    But, I can tell it quickly. There's 
                    this professor, he's the 
                      competition in the tournament...

                                  ALAN
                    And he stole your keys?

                                    CHARLIE
                    No, he turned my office into a 
                    toxic swamp. He's a bio-chemist, 
                    works with skunks.

                                  ALAN
                    So what? You got skunked?

      Charlie starts to respond, stops. Takes another tack.

                                    CHARLIE
                    He's trying to psych me out.

                                  ALAN
                    Well, you know they always say the 
                    best defense is a good offence.

                    Yes. That's a great idea. I m going 
                    to call Amita.

      Charlie picks up the phone on the table, listens, HEARS THE 
      STACCATO TONE that means,

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)

                                  ALAN
                    I thought you were calling Amita?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Think I just found a way to help 
                    Don catch his fugitive.

      Megan sits in front of a LONG BANK OF MONITORS, watching 
      curiously (ON THE MONITORS: "DIALING", PHONE NUMBERS APPEAR, 
      "CALL CONNECTED", ETC). Charlie enters.

                                  MEGAN
                    Per your instructions, all the 
                    computers are networked. We're 
                      monitoring calling patterns on 50 
                    numbers we got from Ben Ellis' 
                    phone records.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Here's the program with the 
                    algorithm I constructed on Amita's 
                    laptop.

      He hands her a CD-ROM. She puts it into a TOWER...

                                  MEGAN
                    Mind telling me what exactly it is 
                    we're doing?

                                    CHARLIE
                    We're going to find Ben Ellis by 
                      identifying his calling pattern.

                                  MEGAN
                    But he hasn't used his cell since 
                    he got away from David and Colby.

                                    CHARLIE
                    But that doesn't mean he hasn't 
                    been making any calls.

                          (gets it)
                    He's borrowed someone else's phone.

                                    CHARLIE
                    And this algorithm will find his

      Charlie is lost in the monitors, watching the ALGORITHM 
      highlight calls, the numbers flash until the pattern fails 
      and the numbers are abandoned.

                    Traces of the poison used to kill 
                    both Munson and Lopez were on your 
                    locker. In your gym bag.

                                  BEN
                    How many times I gotta tell you 
                    this? I've never seen that bag.

                                  COLBY
                    Really? It was in your locker.

                                  BEN
                    Why? Why would I kill those 
                    fighters?

                                  COLBY
                    Moves you up in the rankings.

                    moves up too. Or Bill Tallridge? 
                    Tallridge was in prison.

                    Yeah, that's it. Walk away. Because 
                    that's what you do.

      David turns to go at Ben, Colby blocks him.

                                  COLBY
                    Easy.

      David and Ben lock eyes. Then David exits, real hot.

                    away an inner emotion -- like your 
                    brother. He always checks his watch 
                    anytime he feels threatened.

                                    CHARLIE
                    He does do that...Anyway, all I 
                    need you to tell me to figure out 
                    what Novich's tell is?

                                  MEGAN
                    Well, strictly speaking, Charlie, 
                    you're talking about an 
                      observational exercise.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I have to watch Novich?

                                  MEGAN
                    But it's got to be under the right 
                      conditions. You have to watch him 
                    while he's under duress.

                                    CHARLIE
                    And then I can see his tell.

                                  MEGAN
                    Mm-hmm.

      Charlie processes this.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Can you help me with some 
                      surveillance equipment?

                                  MEGAN
                    No.

      David arrives at the morgue.

                                  DAVID
                    I got your message. You said you 
                    had something.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    From the DNA tests. I found three 
                    different specimens on the bag. 
                    Compared them to your friend's 
                    swab.

      She hands David a folder.

                                  DAVID
                    Ben's not a match. So someone did 
                    plant the bag in his locker.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Physical evidence says he's telling 
                    the truth.


                                  DAVID
                    I owe you one.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    David, if Ben Ellis didn't kill 
                    those two fighters. Who did? And 
                    why would they want to frame him?

2727

      Don paces in front of the PLASMA. Pictures of Munson and 
      Lopez. Megan, David and Colby man the desks.

                                  DON
                    Okay, so if Ellis is in the 
                    clear...

                                  COLBY
                    Which takes us back to square one. 
                    Who killed these guys?

                                  DAVID
                    Maybe somebody opposed to the 
                    violence of the sport.

                                  COLBY
                    Charlie said the motives were 
                    related to the fighters' rankings.

                                  DAVID
                    So what about the other fighters 
                    Ben mentioned.

                                  MEGAN
                      Tallridge?

                                  COLBY
                    Nah. I checked it out. He was 
                    fighting in Japan when Lopez was 
                    killed. Gives him an alibi.

                                  DAVID
                    What if this is just about the All- 
                    Out Fighting League?

                                  DON
                    You thinking this could be an 
                    attack from a competitor?

                                  MEGAN
                    Somebody with a grudge against 
                    Alston.

                                  DON
                    Let's talk to Alston again. And 
                    let's take a closer look at his 
                    business. See what the competition 
                    might be worried about.

      Don and David talk to Alston.

                                  DAVID
                    We think someone may be targeting 
                    fighters as a away of getting at 
                    you.

                                  ALSTON
                    Me? I don't understand.

                                  DAVID
                    These murders don't exactly help 
                    your efforts to clean up the sport.

                                  DON
                    Who might want to sabotage your 
                    business?

                                  ALSTON
                    I don't know... Boxing, baseball, 
                      basketball. Our ratings make us the 
                    fastest growing sport in the 
                    country.

                                  DON
                    Yeah?  What about you personally? 
                    Any threats against you?

                                  ALSTON
                    What? No.

                                  DON
                    I d like to take a look at a list 
                    of your investors, if that s all 
                    right.

                                  ALSTON
                    I don't see how that will help.

                                  DAVID
                    If you're not the target, someone 
                    else involved in the business might 
                    be.

                                  ALSTON
                    You're Sinclair, right? A detective 
                    from LAPD came to see me yesterday. 
                    Told me about you and Ben Ellis.

                                  DAVID
                    I don't think that's the issue.

                    Oh, I think it's right on point. I 
                      understand loyalty. I do. But 
                    you're not going to jeopardize my 
                    business because you're not happy 
                    about arresting your friend.

                                  DON
                    Nice speech, but I want to see 
                    those records.

                                  ALSTON
                    I'll be happy to cooperate when you 
                    have something specific.

                                  DON
                    You need to cooperate now, or I'm

                                  ALSTON

      Colby and David step through the frayed remains of the HAZMAT 
      tape. Charlie stares at his laptop. Looks up.

                                  COLBY
                    Hey, Charlie.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hey. Check this out.

      David and Colby lean over Charlie's shoulders.

                                  DAVID
                    What is that smell?

                                    CHARLIE
                    You get used to it after a while.

                                  DAVID
                    I don't think so.

      ON THE MONITOR, B&W image of Stanley Novich walking down a 
      HALLWAY in the BIO-CHEM DEPARTMENT.

                                    CHARLIE
                    There he is! That's Stanley Novich. 
                    And that's where the door to his 
                    lab used to be.

                                  DAVID
                    Used to be?

                                    CHARLIE
                    I had one of my Dad's contractor 
                    buddies bring in a crew late last 
                    night. They dry-walled his doorway. 
                    Then painted it to match the wall.


                                  COLBY
                    You made his office disappear?

      David and Colby trade looks of amused confusion.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Now watch.

      ON THE MONITOR, Novich is realizing something is amiss. He's 
      checking his position, trying to make sense of his "loss."

      HE RUBS THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE.

                    Oh!  See that? That could be it 
                    right there.

                                  COLBY
                    Could be what?

                                    CHARLIE
                    I'm hoping the stress of losing his 
                    office will force him to reveal his 
                    poker tell.

      ON THE MONITOR, Novich starts to move more frantically now.

      RUBS HIS NOSE AGAIN.

                                  DAVID
                    He did it again.

                    Gotcha!

      Charlie rubs his hands together gleefully. Turns to the 
      agents. Amita enters.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Now. What can I do for you?

                    We have some new information 
                    related to that stuff you did on 
                    the fighter rankings.

                                  AMITA

                                  DAVID
                    You said before that Ben benefitted 
                    from the deaths of those fighters 
                    because his ranking improved.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Exactly.

                                  DAVID
                    What if the rankings weren't the 
                    only thing that determines who 
                    fights for the title?

                    Ben told me that the head of the 
                    league sets the fights, rankings 
                    are only a loose guide.

                                  AMITA

                    alone determined the fighting 
                    patterns.

                    Big time. Amita and I will need to 
                      completely rework the Network Flow 
                      analysis...

      Megan is working behind a pile of files. Don walks up. 

                                  DON
                    What's all this?

                                  MEGAN
                    Alston sent over the business 
                    records you asked for.


                                  DON
                    You could have gone. And?

                                  MEGAN
                    Not much here, really. Except that 
                    the All-Out Fighting League is in a 
                    fair amount of debt.

                                  DON
                    I thought the business was a big 
                    success.

                                  MEGAN
                    It is. But Alston's focus has been 
                    on expanding the business.

                                  DON
                    So he's over-extended.

      Megan looks closely at the STATEMENT she's holding.

                                  MEGAN
                    And it looks like he's using his 
                    equity in the business as 
                      collateral on the loans.

                                  DON
                    So if he can't cover... He loses 
                      everything.

      Charlie and Amita stand before the PLASMA. A PYRAMID OF 
      FIGHTERS (10) on the screen. Don and David look on.

                                    CHARLIE
                    We looked at almost 100 fighters 
                    over the past three years. Mapped 
                    out idealized fight trajectories 
                    for each.

                                  DAVID
                    Idealized trajectories?

                                  AMITA
                      Essentially, we used skill level 
                    and past performance to create an 
                    objective rating for each fighter. 
                    Then we compared our results with 
                    the actual fight histories.

                                    CHARLIE
                    And what we found... well, it's 
                    like driving two different routes 
                    to the same destination...

      ENTER VISION:

      QUICK-FIRE MONTAGE OF TRAFFIC, RED LIGHTS AND RAILROAD 
        CROSSINGS...

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    One way has all the normal traffic 
                    hazards, potholes, pedestrians...

      A CAR SPEEDS THROUGH A STRING OF GREEN LIGHTS.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    But the other considers road 
                    hazards in advance and maps out the 
                    most efficient route.

                                  DAVID
                    You compared what actually happened 
                    to what should've happened.

                                    CHARLIE
                    An ideal world where fighters 
                    advance only according to their 
                    merits.


                                  DON
                    So what did you find?

                                    CHARLIE
                    For the past two years, Ken 
                      Bainsworth has seen nothing but 
                    green lights.

                                  AMITA
                    There's no way that would have 
                    happened just by chance.

                                  DAVID
                    Are you saying they're fixing 
                    fights?

                                    CHARLIE
                    No. The fights are very real. But
                    someone's been manipulating his 
                    schedule to insure Bainsworth 
                    doesn't lose.

      David starts rifling through the pile of DOCUMENTS.

                                  DON
                    Why would someone do that?

                                  DAVID
                    Megan said the AFL's pay-per-view 
                    deal for the Alva Championship was 
                    going to be the richest in the 
                    sport's history... He finds what 
                    he's looking for...

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    But only if Bainsworth is the 
                      challenger.

      He hands THE CONTRACT to Don.

                                  DON
                    So Alston has no choice but ti make 
                    it happen.

                    So he gets Lopez and Munson killed.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Probably  cause they could have 
                    beaten Bainsworth.

      Colby enters.

                                  COLBY
                    Bill Tallridge broke his hand in

                                  AMITA
                    So will they cancel the fight?

                                  DON
                    No way.

                                  DAVID
                    Venue's already booked. Tickets are

                    If the fighter who goes into the

                    Ken Bainsworth, he's in danger.

                    Yeah, they announced the 
                      replacement, same time they broke 
                    the news about the injury.
                          (looks at David)
                    It's Ben.

3333

      Megan sits at Claudia's desk. On a TABLE nearby, there is an 
      array of WATER BOTTLES, MMA FIGHTING GLOVES, HEAD-GEAR and a 
      MOUTHPIECE all in EVIDENCE BAGS.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    I found traces of a silicone 
                    polymer in the sodium fluoroacetate 
                    used to kill Pete Munson. I was 
                    hoping I could use it to pin down 
                    the manufacturer.

                                  MEGAN
                    And?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    I've been through every chemical 
                    catalogue in the library. I've 
                    spoken to ten different 
                      manufacturers...

                                  MEGAN
                    And nothing?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    I've even checked with the 
                    packaging companies.

                                  MEGAN
                      Packaging?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Yeah, I figured the silicone might 
                    have come from the container the 
                    chemicals were sold in.

                                  MEGAN
                    Why would you think that?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Because that silicone compound is 
                    sometimes used to insulate molded 
                    plastic.

      Megan moves to the table. 

      POV on the MOUTHPIECE. She picks it up.

                                  MEGAN
                    Something like this?

                    I assumed the 1080 was on the

      Ben is on the table. A TRAINER stands nearby. David and Colby 
      enter.

                    Then he needs me to fight, doesn't

                                  COLBY

      The ANNOUNCER is announcing the FIGHTERS.

                                  ANNOUNCER
                    Fighting in the blue corner. 
                    Weighing in at two hundred and five 
                    pounds... The former light-
                      heavyweight champion... Ken "The 
                    Big Bang" Bainsworth.

      The trainer lifts the BUCKET into Ben's corner.

      ON DAVID, scanning the crowd from near the ring. He watches 
      Alston take his seat, ringside.

                                  ANNOUNCER (CONT D)
                    In the red corner. The challenger. 
                    With a record of 11 wins, 2 losses. 
                    From the Bronx, New York. The pride 
                    of Jerome Avenue... Ben Ellis.


      ON COLBY, walking the inside perimeter of the Arena.

      ON BEN, in his corner, waiting for the bell. The trainer 
      reaches into the bucket, pulls out the MOUTHPIECE, puts it in 
      Ben's mouth.

      ON DAVID, watching Alston. Alston checks his watch.

      THE BELL RINGS. Ben charges Bainsworth, delivers a big 
        combination. Bainsworth dances away. But Ben is relentless. 
      Bainsworth lands a COUNTER. Ben DIVES FOR HIS LEGS. Takes him 
      to the mat. Ben catches Bainsworth in an ankle lock. 
      Bainsworth taps out.

      The BELL RINGS AGAIN. BEN IS THE CHAMPION.

                                  ANNOUNCER (CONT D)
                    The winner by submission-- Ben 
                    Ellis!

      The crowd goes wild. 

      On Alston, disbelief. Then he notices David is standing next 
      to him. 

                                  DAVID
                    Expecting a different result?

      David holds the BLACK MOUTHPIECE in his hand already in an

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    We found the mouthpiece.  You re 
                    under arrest. Turn around! Hands 
                    behind your back.

      David gestures to two plainclothes.

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    Take him away.

      TWO AGENTS lead him away.

      Ben, smiling, makes his way out of the ring to Colby and 
      David.

                                  BEN
                    I didn't lose.

                                  COLBY
                    No, you didn't.

                                  BEN
                    Didn't die either... Thank you.
                          (a beat, then to Colby)
                    Back there, front of my cousin's 
                    house, when you picked me up... 
                    were you really gonna shoot me?

                                  COLBY
                    Yes.

      Colby exits. There's an awkward beat for Ben and David.

                                  DAVID
                    You looked good.

                                  BEN
                    Thanks.

                                  DAVID
                    Think you can take Alva?

                                  BEN
                    We'll just have to see about that.

      A beat.

                                  DAVID
                    Look, about Earl--

                                  (MORE)
                                  BEN
                          (cuts him off)
                    No, no.

                    What s in the past is past, right?
                          (beat)
                    We're cool... Right?

                                  DAVID
                    Yeah. We're cool.

      They hug, before Ben disappears into the crowd to cheering.

3636

      Fade in GREEN FELT, A STACK OF CHIPS. Charlie peers through 
      them. Novich and A THIRD PLAYER at the table. The Third 
      player tosses in her cards and exits to light applause.

      Charlie watches Novich rake in the chips. ON DON, working his 
      way along a line of people in the audience, takes a place 
      next to Alan and Amita.

                                  ALAN
                    Charlie's still in it. They're down 
                    to the final two.

                                  DEALER
                    Dr. Eppes, the small blind, please. 
                    The large blind is yours, Dr. 
                    Novich.

      Charlie pushes in chips, then Novich; twice as much. The 
      dealer deals TWO CARDS EACH to Charlie and Novich. Then turns 
      the FLOP. Three cards face up. KING OF HEARTS, TEN OF CLUBS, 
      THREE OF SPADES.

                                  DEALER (CONT D)
                    Action to you, Dr. Eppes.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I ll check.

      Charlie pushes in chips to match Novich's blind.

                                  NOVICH
                    Check.

      The Dealer drops the TURN (fourth card). QUEEN OF HEARTS.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I ll bet one hundred.

                                  NOVICH
                    Raise two hundred.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I'll call.

      ON Alan, Don and Amita. They whisper.

                                  ALAN
                    You think Charlie has the cards?

                                  AMITA
                    He must have a king. Otherwise he 
                    would have folded. Given the 
                      percentages.

      The Dealer drops the RIVER, the final card. TEN OF HEARTS.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I ll bet two hundred.

                                  NOVICH
                      I raise... one thousand.

      The crowd gasps.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You have the tens, don't you?

      Novich smiles a Cheshire Cat's smile. Then RUBS HIS NOSE.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    I'm all in.

      The crowd gasps again.

                                  DEALER
                    If you want to call, you're all in 
                    too.

      Novich blinks hard.

                                  NOVICH
                    I guess I m all in, too.

      Pushes in his chips. Turns over his cards. A KING AND AN ACE.

                                  DEALER 
                    Two pair. Kings and Tens.

      On Alan, Don and Amita.

                                  ALAN
                    Thta s not good. I guess Charlie 
                    got beat.

      On Charlie. He flips his cards. A TWO OF HEARTS and FOUR OF 
      HEARTS.

                                  DEALER
                    Flush. Winner.

      Charlie looks into the crowd. Amita looks back, smiles.

                                  ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

                    Eppes.
