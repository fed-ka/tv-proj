      It s a beautiful suburban morning.  Sun shines.  Birds chirp.  
      People are out watering their lawns, getting the mail, etc.    

      Two Moms pass, pushing strollers.  They look at the guys 
      house (which we haven t seen) and react --  What the hell? 

      REVEAL the front lawn and the house.  It s a wreck.  There 
      was clearly a BLOWOUT PARTY last night.  Beer bottles 
      everywhere.  The  Vo is parked halfway up on the lawn.  
      There s an inflatable raft in the bushes, scattered weight-
      lifting equipment (bench press, pull-up bar, cinder block 
      weights, etc.), and a hatchet stuck in the tree.  

      As we STEADY-CAM in towards the house, we see ADAM, weight 
      belt and Edward Forty-Hands asleep on the roof.  As he wakes-
      up and stretches, we push forward into the...  


      We push past Ders, towards the pool, which has two giant 
      empty trash cans floating in it -- their contents littered 
      across the pool, till we find Adam carefully climbing down 
      from the roof still rocking his Edward Forty-Hands. 

                                  ADAM
                          (wincing)
                    My brain is fucked. 

                                  DERS
                    Check this dude out. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                Workaholics - Dry Guys - Network Draft - 1/21/11            2.

      ANGLE ON: Blake, sitting on a lawn chair inside the hot tub, 
      clothes on, shades on, reading Nickelodeon Magazine, which is 
      half in the water.

                                  ADAM
                    How long you been up?

      Blake, clearly still asleep, tips forward into water and 
      wakes up in a panic.


      The guys play  OJ  pong.  Adam makes one.  Ders has to drink.

                                  BLAKE/ADAM
                    Drink!  Drink!  Drink!

      Ders looks in his cup of OJ. 

                                  DERS
                    Wasn t this ball just on the 
                    ground?  Look.

      Ders pulls a long hair off of the ball.  

                                  ADAM
                    Eww.  Blake hair.  

                                  BLAKE
                    My bad.


      The guys approach the office, passing a CONSTRUCTION SITE.  
      Ders  hair is still blonde but it now has black streaks in 
      it.  He looks miserable. 






                                                                              (CONTINUED)                Workaholics - Dry Guys - Network Draft - 1/21/11            7.

                    I thought not drinking was supposed

                    I tried to dye it brown but then 
                    this happened.  I didn t sleep at 
                    all.  Guys, I don t know if I can 
                    do this.  I m weaker than I

                    Here, this will help.

      Adam takes out a container of turkey slices. 

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                      Scientists say cold turkey is the

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Adam weaves through defenders and kicks the ball through the 
      makeshift goal.  He does a soccer-style runaround, shirt-over-
      head celebration.

                                  ADAM
                      GOOOOALLLLL!!!

      The construction workers clap and laugh with Adam.  They 
      think he s a riot.  One of the WORKERS approaches with a 
      sixer of beers.

                                  WORKER
                    Nice shot, buddy.  Have a beer.

      Adam s eyes light up as he s offered a beer.


      Adam is still fixed on the beer, but then he snaps out of it.

                                  ADAM
                    Actually I can t.  I m in a pact 
                    with my friends.  No beer.  So.  
                    Thanks, but - however you say  no  
                    in Spanish - that is what I m 
                    saying to you, my friend.

                                  WORKER
                    Man, I don t know anything about a 
                    sober pact, but I do know six-pack, 
                    so come on, drink up.

                                  ADAM
                          (caving in)
                    Dammit.  That s a beautiful play on 
                    words.

      And he hesitantly takes the beer from Worker.  Adam looks the 
      beer over, his self-control on overdrive.


      Blake and Ders bolt out to catch Adam, who wasn t drinking 
      the beer, but still feels like he s been caught.

                                  BLAKE
                    Hold it right there, bud!

                                  DERS
                    Well, well.  Looks like someone s 
                    too good for his friends.  You 
                    wanna bail on the shrink, I get 
                    that, but breaking the oath?

                    Did we not do our secret pinky 
                    swear?
                          (then)
                    I had your pinky in my mouth.

                                  ADAM
                    Slow your mouth... down.  I didn t 
                    break the oath, so don t even go there.

                                  DERS
                    You re the one who s going there.  
                    I m here.  You re there.

                                  ADAM
                    I wasn t going to drink it, stupid.  

                                  BLAKE
                    Just like you  didn t have any 
                    secret booze left.   Are you ever 
                    not lying?

                                  ADAM
                    You know what, now, I m drinking 
                    it.  So screw off, you dumb idiots.

                    Gimme that beer, you re not 
                    breaking the oath!

                                  ADAM
                    Get away!  It s mine!

      Adam scurries away and climbs up the construction site s 
      scaffolding for refuge.  He reaches the top (eight feet high) 
      and holds the beer up in victory.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Ha ha!  This beer s gonna taste so 
                      gooooooood.

      Ders and Blake start shaking the scaffolding, making it hard 
      for Adam to open the beer and hold on at the same time.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Stop!  I m gonna fall, come on!

                                  DERS
                          (shaking the scaff)
                    It s for your own good, you moron!

      Adam has a near-fall and drops the beer in order to grab 
      hold.  The beer lands on the ground.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)              Workaholics - Dry Guys - Network Draft - 1/21/11            21.

      He runs, picks it up.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                    You see this stuff, Adam?  You 
                    gotta get rid of it... before it...
                          (sniffs the beer, mmm...)
                    It s poison, you know.  Sweet sweet 
                    poison.

      And Blake taps the top of the can, ready to open, but Ders 
      runs over snatching it from him.

                                  DERS
                    NO!  HEY!  Get a hold of 
                      yourselves.  Show a little 
                      restraint.  I wish you could see 
                    how pathetic you two look.

      Adam and Blake catch their breaths.

                                  DERS (CONT D)
                    We re done with this beer, now 
                    let s go inside.

      And with that Ders THROWS the beer and walks past the guys to 
      head inside... but they didn t hear it land... Ders palmed 
      the beer, never threw it.  It s all an act, he wants the beer 
      just as bad.  The other guys spot the beer and rush Ders, as 
      he tries to open it.

      AHHHH!  He ends up dropping it and now it s spraying 
      everywhere.  They all scramble for it, but Ders picks it up.

                                  DERS (CONT D)
                    Oh great!  You want it?  All yours, buddy!

      And Ders aims to throw it at Adam, but Adam ducks and Ders 
      hits COOL ERIC in the face.  Shit.

                                  COOL ERIC
                    FUUUUUCK!  AGGGHHH.  INSIDE RIGHT NOW!

      ANGLE ON:  The construction workers that watched everything.

                    We ve got like sixty beers, man.

      1. Playing beer pong.  Adam shoots and scores!  We see inside 
      the disgusting cup.  With the ping pong ball there s hair and 
      other grossness.  Ders takes out the hair and chugs it with 
      no abandon.

      2. Devouring disgusting fast food with beers.

                                  ADAM
                    The crispiness of the taco shell 
                    really compliments the smoothness
