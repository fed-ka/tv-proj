It is morning rush hour. Sam and Carl, both wearing suits
and ties, exit the Wall Street subway station and approach
the Headquarters of Market Security Bank & Trust.
CARL
Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move
your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so
you could squeeze in Gary Alan. He
called yesterday and said he has to
see you today about the Danway stuff.
Three o'clock was the only time he
could make it. Also, the board meeting
in L.A. has been confirmed for the
12th. I got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight.
Sam seems preoccupied.
CARL
(continuing)
Hey, Sam, relax. This isn't brain
surgery you're going into.
SAM
I hate pitching to these Japanese
guys. They make me nervous. I mean,
what am I supposed to say, "Who do
you think'll win that big Sumo
championship"?
CARL
Sam, you'll be fine. You're great
with people.
Sam's jacket flares open. He is wearing yellow suspenders.
Carl notices.
CARL
(continuing)
Hey, nice. I like those.
Sam, not completely comfortable wearing them, buttons his
jacket.
SAM
...Molly.
Carl smiles and then turns to admire a car going by.
CARL
Jesus, look at that, a Testerossa.
That's the car I'm gonna drive when
I'm making two hundred grand.
SAM
Better pay off your Mustang first.
OMITTED
Bright marquee lights sparkle overhead as Sam and Molly exit
the theatre. It is a beautiful brisk night.
SAM
I loved it.
MOLLY
I could tell.
She smiles and squeezes his arm. They walk silently down a
dark street, heading toward their loft. The pavement is full
of shadows.
MOLLY
(continuing)
Did I tell you what Marcia said?
SAM
Six times.
MOLLY
Six? No I didn't. Sam, don't be so
blas. I'll have two major pieces in
the show. The New York Times reviews
her gallery all the time. This could
be huge.
SAM
Molly, the "New York Times" is some
frustrated little critic with pimples
on his ass who flunked out of art
school. Who cares what The New York
Times thinks?
MOLLY
Eight million readers, that's who.
SAM
Your work's beautiful. That's a fact,
Moll. It doesn't matter what anyone
thinks.
We can tell from the expression on Molly's face that it does.
Sam puts his arm around her. She nestles close to him. Then,
suddenly, she stops and looks up. There is an unexpected
seriousness in her voice.
MOLLY
(continuing)
I want to marry you, Sam.
SAM
(taken aback)
What?
MOLLY
I've been thinking about it for days.
More than thinking. I want to do it.
I want to jump in whole hog...
(she pauses)
What is that look for?
SAM
(staring at her)
It's just been so long since... I
mean, you never wanted to talk about
it.
There is a long pause.
MOLLY
Do you love me, Sam?
SAM
What do you think, Moll?
MOLLY
How come you never say it?
SAM
What are you talking about?
MOLLY
You say "ditto". It's not the same.
SAM
People say "I love you" all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.
MOLLY
Sometimes you need to hear it.
Sam stops and stares at Molly. He pauses quietly. He is about
to speak when A MAN'S FACE emerges from the shadows behind
him. Molly gasps. Sam spins around.
AN INTENSE LOOKING MAN
is standing in the darkness between two buildings. He stares
at the couple for a moment and then steps onto the sidewalk.
Sam and Molly stand motionless. The man hesitates and then
begins walking the other way. Molly exhales a deep breath.
Sam takes Molly's arm and they continue briskly down the
street. Suddenly they hear FOOTSTEPS coming after them.
MOLLY
What should we do?
SAM
Let me handle this.
Sam stops abruptly and turns around. A gun is staring him in
the face. Molly screams.
WILLIE
Your wallet!
Sam waits a beat.
MOLLY
Give it to him!
Sam reaches for his jacket. The Mugger grabs his wrist and
then carefully pulls the wallet out himself.
SAM
Take the money. Just leave the wallet
and my...
He swipes Sam across the head. Molly screams. The Mugger
whacks her across the face. Sam explodes, plowing into the
mugger with all his might.
MOLLY
Sam, No!
There is a wild, all out brawl. Sam fights like a mad man.
Suddenly the GUN goes off. The Mugger panics and takes off
running. Sam charges after him.
MOLLY
Sam!!!!!
The two men run down the dark street, but the Mugger is
already a full block ahead and disappears into the shadows.
Sam gives up. Slowly he turns and begins walking back toward
Molly.
We can see Molly dimly at the end of the block as Sam
approaches. She is screaming for help. Frightened, Sam calls
out.
SAM
Molly!
She doesn't answer. Sam tenses and starts running toward
her. He is just three feet away when suddenly he stops. An
expression of pure terror overwhelms his face.
CUT TO:
CLOSEUP - MOLLY
drenched in blood. Her eyes are glazed, on the verge of shock.
Panting, she stoops down to the curb as THE CAMERA TRAVELS
WITH HER. She grabs hold of something lying in the shadows
and pulls it toward her.
It is Sam's dead body she is holding in her arms.
Sam's ghostly form, still solid to all appearances, stands
beside Molly. His eyes are awash in horror and confusion. He
seems unable to move. THE CAMERA HOLDS on his face as the
full impact of his situation dawns in his eyes.
Suddenly he lets out a blood-curdling scream.
SAM
No!!!!!!
He jumps down toward his body and reaches out to grab hold
of his motionless form. His hands make a strange SOUND as
they pass right though it. It is terrifying. Sam jumps up,
crazed, frenzied, and begins circling Molly. It is as though
he is trying to undo what has been done.
SAM
(continuing)
This isn't happening. It's not
happening.
He reaches out to Molly for help. His hand cuts through her
shoulder. He screams.
FOOTSTEPS. People are running down the street. The sound of
SIRENS can be heard in the distance. Two MEN run toward Sam.
He yells out at them.
SAM
(continuing)
Help me!
They run right through him. He gasps in stunned terror.
Sam watches helplessly as they reach his body. Molly looks
up and begins screaming hysterically. One of the Men grabs
her as the other goes for Sam's wrist. There is no sign of
life.
The first Man holds Molly back as his friend stoops down and
begins some form of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. There is
no response. Sam bends down, trying desperately to help. It
is a futile gesture.
SAM
Do it! Do it!
The Man bangs on Sam's chest. Blood gushes from the wound.
Molly recoils. He bangs again.
CUT ABRUPTLY TO:
Swirls of light speed toward the ambulance as car headlights
and streetlamps merge in a wild dizzying rush. The SIREN
wails into the night.
Slowly, images begin to emerge out of the blackness. It takes
a moment to realize that they are scenes from Sam's funeral.
The CAMERA TRACKS along rows of mourners as seen from SAM'S
P.O.V. He seems to be floating among them. We hear snippets
of conversations. It all seems strangely odd and disjointed.
Time seems unfixed, malleable.
We see a MINISTER standing beside the grave.
MINISTER
As we say farewell to our friend Sam
Wheat, we are reminded of his
kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy
of spirit...
The CAMERA KEEPS MOVING. Sam's associates from the bank are
among the mourners.
MINISTER
(continuing)
All that we treasure, our friends,
our loved ones, our body, our mind,
are but on loan to us. We must
surrender them all. We are all
travelers on the same road which
leads to the same end.
Sam notices a WOMAN in a fancy print dress comforting one of
the mourners. The woman looks up at him, smiles, and waves.
Sam is surprised. He looks behind him, but no one is there.
As he turns back, the woman is walking away. She appears
just like any normal person until she approaches a large
gravestone and passes right through it. Sam is shocked.
MINISTER
As our loved one enters eternal life,
let us remember that love, too, is
eternal, that although we will miss
him, our love will light the void
and dispel the darkness.
Suddenly, Molly ENTERS THE FRAME. Sam spots her. The CAMERA
STOPS.
SAM
Molly.
She does not respond. RUTH, her sister, leans over to her.
Tears form in Molly's eyes. A hand reaches out to give her a
tissue. Molly looks up. It is Carl. She gives him her hand.
He squeezes it with affection.
MINISTER
...and into Your hands we commend
his spirit. May he rest in peace. In
the name of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost. Amen.
The casket is lowered into the ground. Molly approaches the
grave. She us a little unsteady. Carl takes her elbow. A
shovel is placed in her hands. With great emotional effort
she lifts a shovelful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket.
It lands with a REVERBERATING finality. Sam shudders.
DISSOLVE:
LONG SHOT - PEOPLE
leaving the cemetery. We hear them talking.
VOICES
What time you going back to work?...
What's the buzz on Digital? It's
sad. He was so young... How's your
new Honda?... Going away this weekend?
CUT BACK TO:
CLOSEUP - SAM
desperately alone. Down the hill, people are getting back
into their cars. Sam can see Molly being let into a limousine.
He stands there staring at his own casket, grieving. Then,
after a moment, he turns away. Separating from his body,
from his own grave site, he runs after her.
DISSOLVE:
The Mugger steps out onto the sidewalk and hurries toward
the subway. A patch of sleeve soaks up the blood from his
eye.
Sam starts after the man but instantly freezes. Hordes of
people crowd the sidewalk. The crush of humanity is
frightening. Two lovers, holding hands, are coming right at
him. Before Sam is able to move, we hear the sound of their
arms cutting through his ghostly form.
Sam tries instinctively to dodge the crowds but people
approach him from all angles.
We hear a BABY CARRIAGE roll through Sam's feet and he nearly
falls over trying to avoid it. His instincts will not let
go.
A barrage of images and SOUNDS assaults Sam. It is more than
he can handle. Still, he refuses to give up. He stays close
to the Mugger.
The Mugger heads down a flight of steps into the IRT.
The train stops at an elevated subway platform in Brooklyn.
OMITTED
SAM'S P.O.V.
Sam sees the Mugger exiting the train and frantically rushes
after him.
Sam follows the Mugger down a long covered staircase to the
street.
The Mugger heads toward 321 Prospect Place. The streets are
lined with old apartment buildings. Many windows are boarded
up. TWO MEN, standing on the corner, are slamming a piece of
heavy machinery onto the pavement.
Sam hears GOSPEL MUSIC coming from a storefront church and
notices a sign, "SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER,
ADVISOR." He looks up to a third story window and sees a
similar sign with day-glo arrows pointing to the entrance on
the street. He seems curious, but then realizes that the
Mugger is nearly halfway down the block. He turns and rushes
after him.
Sam and the mugger approach a tenement building at 321
Prospect Place.
Sam storms down the street. His movements seem undirected,
utterly aimless. He is seething inside.
Suddenly Sam looks up. An old BAG LADY is walking down the
street talking loudly to a SHORT WOMAN tagging along beside
her. As they approach a street pole, the Bag Lady swerves to
the side. The Short Woman, however, walks right through it.
Passersby laugh at the Old Lady talking to herself. Sam,
unsettled, rushes away.
As Sam rounds a corner, a sudden blast of MUSIC explodes out
of nowhere. Sam jumps into the street, gasping. A phonograph
needle SCRATCHES across a record and the MUSIC STOPS. A
woman's voice booms out:
WOMAN'S VOICE
Sorry 'bout that.
PANNING SHOT
to a pair of loudspeakers in a storefront window. The MUSIC
blares out once more and SOUNDS of gospel fill the street.
Sam looks up. He is back in front of the storefront church
with the sign for SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER,
ADVISOR, hanging overhead. Below it is another sign. "Contact
the dearly departed. $20.00".
Sam stares at the sign with curiosity. The MUSIC is
compelling. After a moment's hesitation, he goes in the open
door.
Oda Mae approaches the loft building and buzzes Molly's
apartment. She waits a few moments.
ODA MAE
There's nobody there.
SAM
Just wait.
ODA MAE
No, sir. I did what I promised. I
said I'd come and I'm here. I didn't
say anything 'bout waitin'.
SAM
Just one more time. Please. It's a
big place.
Oda Mae turns to leave. Sam, desperate, starts to sing.
SAM
(continuing)
"Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the
wall, ninety nine bottles of beer,"
Oda Mae stops. She turns back to the buzzer and rings once
more. Suddenly Molly answers.
MOLLY (V.O.)
Hello, who's there?
ODA MAE
(nervous)
Don't go away. It's Oda Mae Brown. I
called you last night. Your friend
Sam says you gotta talk to me.
There is a CLICK as Molly hangs up.
Oda Mae is standing by the curb and shouting up to Molly's
fifth floor window. Several people stare at her curiously.
She turns to them.
ODA MAE
Hey, do you mind? This here's a
private conversation.
The people turn away. She turns back to the window. Sam
prompts her.
SAM
Ask her about the sweater in the
closet, the one she knitted that's
too big.
ODA MAE
What about the sweater you knitted
that was too big?
SAM
Four sizes.
ODA MAE
Four sizes.
SAM
She couldn't throw it out. I saw. I
was there.
ODA MAE
You couldn't throw it out. He saw.
He was there. This is for real. Hey
do you hear me up there?
A WORKMAN peers out of a second story window.
WORKMAN
I hear you.
ODA MAE
I'm not talkin' to you.
WORKMAN
Haven't you ever heard of phones?
ODA MAE
Kiss my behind!
(yelling again)
Listen, I'm not gonna stand here all
day.
WORKMAN
Thank God.
ODA MAE
Forget it. I've had enough of this.
Oda Mae is about to walk away when the entrance door opens.
Molly steps outside. Oda Mae sees her and stops.
ODA MAE
(continuing)
Molly?
(Molly nods)
I'm Oda Mae Brown.
(walking over and
shaking her hand)
You can call me Oda.
Carl is on the street heading back to his car. Sam is beside
him, yelling right into his face.
He is screaming and cursing at the top of his lungs but Carl
doesn't hear him.
SAM
You fucker! You mother fucker! I had
a life, Goddamn you. I had a life!
From the distance, we see Sam smashing into Carl. It is like
hitting the air. For all of his rage and bluster, there is
nothing he can do.
Molly, neatly dressed, exits her building and hails a cab.
She hops inside. Seconds later she hops out again, yelling.
MOLLY
You white fascist bigot. Who do you
think you are? Bed Stuy's part of
New York, you know. This is America.
The driver speeds off. Molly gives him the finger.
Molly exits a subway station and walks toward 131st Street.
She is the only white woman on the block and heads turn as
she passes.
WOMAN
Hey, Snow, you lost or sumpin'?
Molly pays no attention. Children run up to her, stare, and
run away.
TRACKING SHOT
When Molly turns down 131st Street, the crowds disperse and
she is all alone. There is a sense of menace in the air. A
group of young men sitting on a stoop watches as she walks
by. One of them whistles. Molly keeps walking.
Molly sees Willie's building. She walks into the dank lobby.
It is dark and full of shadows. Leaning close, she examines
the mail boxes. Willie's name is there. She backs away,
afraid.
Sam rushes to the sidewalk and looks in all directions. Willie
is nowhere to be seen. He hurries back to Oda Mae.
OMITTED
Oda Mae, dressed to the hilt, is walking with Sam toward the
main branch of Market Security Bank & Trust. She seems nervous
and upset.
ODA MAE
This is crazy. This ain't gonna work.
I don't know nothin' 'bout bankin'.
SAM
I'll teach you. You'll learn fast.
As they reach the entrance of the bank, they pass a pair of
NUNS collecting money to build a shelter for the homeless.
One of them holds out a collection box. Oda Mae passes her
by, carefully avoiding eye contact.
Sam and Oda Mae are walking down the street in front of the
bank. Oda Mae is talking to herself.
ODA MAE
$4,000,000. $4,000,000. Lord Almighty.
SAM
Oda Mae. Take the check out of your
purse.
She stops. There is a nervous look on her face.
ODA MAE
Take it out? Why?
SAM
Just do it.
Oda Mae, worried, removes the check but holds onto it tightly.
SAM
(continuing)
Now endorse it. Sign Rita Miller.
ODA MAE
(in shock)
Endorse it? Why?
SAM
Do what I say.
ODA MAE
No!
SAM
That's blood money, Oda. I was killed
for that money. Endorse it now.
ODA MAE
What are you going to do with it?
SAM
We're giving it away.
ODA MAE
Away? What do you mean? To who?
SAM
Look to your left.
Oda Mae looks at the nuns collecting money for the homeless.
She recoils.
ODA MAE
Are you outta your mind?
SAM
Do what I tell you.
ODA MAE
No!
(clutching the check)
I can't.
SAM
Yes, you can. If you don't do it,
they'll track you down. Your only
protection is to get rid of it, now.
ODA MAE
Sweet Jesus, you're killing me, Sam.
SAM
I'm saving you, Oda Mae. You'll go
to heaven for this.
Oda Mae growls at him.
With great difficulty, she approaches the nuns.
The nuns look at her with curiosity and compassion.
SAM
Write "St. Joseph's Shelter".
With great hesitation, Oda Mae begins to write. We sense
that every word is a torment for her. The nuns politely avert
their eyes from the check.
NUN
Bless you, child.
Oda Mae gives her a dirty look and hands the check over.
SAM
I'm proud of you.
ODA MAE
Don't you talk to me. I don't want
you comin' round no more. I mean it.
Understand?
SAM
Come on, we're friends.
ODA MAE
Friends? Friends?
She turns on her high heels and wobbles away. Sam calls after
her.
SAM
I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae.
She growls again. In the background we see the nuns secretly
peeking at the check. One of them, wide-eyed, faints dead
away. The other nun stoops down and fans her face in an
attempt to revive her.
A red Mustang SCREECHES to a stop on the street below. Sam
and Oda Mae run to the window. Carl and Willie are looking
up.
Willie and Carl jump out of the car. They head for Oda Mae's
building.
Willie forces open a back door. They head into the building.
Willie runs from the building and careens down the sidewalk.
People clear a path as he hurls past them like a madman.
Carl, confused, runs after him.
Sam, too, races after Willie, unwilling to let him get away.
Suddenly, a man obstructs his way. Willie goes flying over
him and lands face down on the cement. Before he can get up,
Sam is all over him and does not let up. People stand back
to watch as Willie does battle with himself. Panicked, he
calls out to a bystander.
WILLIE
Help me!
People back away. Carl watches in terror. He understands
exactly what is happening.
Willie, blinded by his own hysteria, runs wildly into the
street. Cars are bearing down on him from all directions. He
does not get out of their way.
One driver sees Willie coming and swerves to avoid him. His
car skids. Another car brakes to avoid a collision and
suddenly both cars crash right into him.
CARL
Look out!
Willie's body is crushed instantly between the two vehicles
as his spirit is catapulted into the air still screaming and
writhing. His ghostly form reaches out to people for help as
they rush past. No one stops.
Willie spins around and sees a mangled body crumpled on the
street. Suddenly, he recognizes that it is his own dead body
lying there. He begins to scream.
A bizarre and frightening CLICKING SOUND fills the air. Sam
looks up. A group of strange dark figures has emerged from
the shadows.
With a loud, terrifying shriek, the dark forms swoop down
and grab hold of Willie. Sam freezes. In an instant they are
dragging Willie, kicking and screaming, down through the
sewer grates into the bowels of the earth.
ANGLE
Sam backs against a wall in absolute horror. Carl, standing
in the crowd, turns and runs.
Molly and Oda Mae are climbing the fire escape.
