    CAMERA PUSHES into a DIRTY HAZE of smoke and churned desert
  dust, DISCOVERING... 

  ... the smoldering heap of a WRECKED MEDEVAC HELICOPTER. 

    CAMERA SLITHERS along the ground, past busted pieces of
    ALUMINUM... a snapped ROTOR BLADE, stabbed in the dirt... 

    Ahead, obscured by smoke and pieces of detritus, there's an
    unidentifiable BODY lying motionless...    

    CAMERA CRAWLS over a cast-off slab of aluminum, and FINDS,
  lying on the ground -- 

  AN EMPTY CSI VEST

  Just its back visible, a couple of nasty slashes through the
    printed "LVPD CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATIONS"...      

                                                                      WHITE BURN TO:



  ANGLE ON THE SKY.  Sun blazing.  A VULTURE circling.  CAMERA
  TILTS DOWN, past the TREE-TOPS to FIND -- 

  A CSI DENALI, coming to a stop on a mountain trail. *

  OVER THIS, SUPER: "THREE HOURS EARLIER"

    RUSSELL, GREG and MORGAN climb out of the Denali.  All three*
    wearing their vests.  Been a long drive.  Ahead, two RANGERS*
  are standing beside a sprawled MAN'S BODY.     *

                                  GREG
                ... I'll give you the ocean, Morgan --    

                                    MORGAN
                And the weather.  The Lakers.  The
                  ability to walk down the street
                  without being handed full-frontal
                  business cards.

                -- But if you seriously think L.A.
                  beats Vegas at night, you need

                You offering your services? 

    Before Greg can tackle that one, Russell raises a hand.     

                                    RUSSELL
                You hear that? 

  The CHUNK-CHUNK-CHUNK of a HELICOPTER -- but as Russell scans*
  the sky, there's no copter visible.  Until, suddenly -- *

    A MEDEVAC COPTER THUNDERS UP from beneath a nearby ridge.  *

  The CSIs are approached by a hustling RANGER. *

                                    RUSSELL*
                        (to Ranger)*

                And you had it, 'til thirty minutes
                  ago.  

  As they follow him toward the body.*

                                  GREG
                Vic came back to life?

                  Didn't have a pulse when I found
                him on my patrol.  Called it in. 
                All a sudden, he groans. 

    They've reached the barely-conscious Vic ("FRANK CAFFERTY").
  45, blue-collar, lying on his back in the dirt.  A bullet*
  wound in his shoulder.  Bullet graze wound on his forehead. 
    Bruising and swelling on his face.  One of his palms is*
    visible, SCUFFED RAW and FILTHY WITH DIRT.  Knees of his*
  jeans also caked with dirt.    *

    Russell crouches, to look Vic in the face.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Hang in there, pal.  Help's here.

  But Vic's non-responsive.  PARAMEDIC SAM RILL rushes over
  from the copter with a gurney.  As he checks the Vic's vitals,
  Greg aims his camera.

    Russell notices RED, ABRADED CIRCLES around Vic's wrists.  

                                    RUSSELL
                  Abrasions on his wrists.  He was

                And burned.

  FADE IN:


6I/E. HELICOPTER/MOUNT STIRLING - DAY6

  AS THE COPTER GAINS ELEVATION, Morgan's at the window, peering
  down.  [Note: The helicopter interior is an open design, with
  no wall between cockpit and cabin.]  Behind her, Paramedic
  Rill is performing CPR chest compressions on the Vic. 

    Morgan grabs her cell, speed-dials Greg. 

                                  GREG (V.O.)
                  Miss me already?

                  o'clock.  Think I just found the*
                  rest of your scene. *

  She picks up binoculars. 

                                                                      INTERCUT WITH:*

    MORGAN'S BINOCULAR POV: Down below, Greg's where we left*
  him, cell-to-ear and turning to look toward his "three*
    o'clock."  *

    MORGAN'S BINOCULAR POV MOVES in that direction, fifty yards,*
  to: a patch of dirt with a LARGE BLOOD POOL, and a crumpled*
    HOODED SWEATSHIRT. *

                                    MORGAN
                        (into cell phone)
                  Won't tell Russell I gave you the tip. 
                You can look smart and owe me one. 

  The Copter suddenly JOLTS with turbulence.  Morgan drops the*
    binoculars, gets knocked against the wall.  

                                  PILOT KIRK HARMON (O.S.)*
                Hey sweetheart?

  She shoots a look to grinning PILOT KIRK HARMON, all aviators*
  and ego. 

                                  PILOT KIRK HARMON*
                  Might get a little bumpy. 

    Morgan pockets her cell.

  Nick steps outside, to --   CSI: "CSI Down" - 1205 - WHITE - 8/31/118.



  And finds, just a few feet from the door, a ditched Portable
    Plasma Cutter.  Picks it up, sees a metal label on it -- 

  CLOSE ON: THE METAL LABEL

  Reads "STOLEN FROM WALSH WELDING"

  Nick grins.  Turns to Brass, in the doorway. 

                                  NICK
                          (reads)

                  I'll give 'em a call.  Casa de Brass
                  could use some discounted pipe-work.

                                                                                CUT TO:



    Russell and Greg approach the spot that Morgan noticed from*
  the copter.  Russell sees a large BLOOD POOL.  *

                                    RUSSELL
                  Blood pool.  Your hunch to head*
                  this way was right.  *

                                  GREG
                  Just trusting my instincts. 

  As Greg PHOTOS and SWABS the blood pool, Russell sees the
  GLINT of something metal, on the ground five feet from the
  large blood pool.  Goes to it, and finds TWO CASINGS, near
  each other.  

                                    RUSSELL
                Two nine-mil casings.  One shot in
                the vic's shoulder, other shot grazed
                his head...

    Russell eyes the surrounding area... and plucks a SPENT BULLET
  from the dirt.  

                                    RUSSELL
                ... and landed here.

                  Ground took the brunt of these shots.  

    GREG'S POV - TWO HOLES IN THE SOIL

    Dispatch Operator isn't worried, business as usual --

    Russell notices -- Greg scanning the sky, face etched with
    concern. 



  We finally CRASH all the way to GROUND LEVEL, right beside a
    SHERIFF'S DEPUTY as he picks up Morgan's BUSTED CELL PHONE. 
  Dusts it off, turns to show it to --

  The SECOND DEPUTY, twenty yards away, who's waving another
    busted cell phone.  The two Deputies glance around the area. 
  All flat desert.  Miles of visibility. 

                                  GREG (V.O.)
                ... But there was no sign of any

                  Cafferty...  He made them toss their

                                  GREG
                  There haven't been any demands.

                  Cafferty.  In case we do establish
                  contact with him.     

    Russell's stressed energy paces him out to -- *

  as she's led by N.D. MAD-10 THUGS -- their faces out of focus --*
  to a clearing, where -- 

  Frank Cafferty is hand-cuffed, on his knees, with another
  N.D. MAD-10 THUG beside him.  Frank's been beaten groggy. *
    (Still wearing his sweatshirt).   *

    Tiffany is thrown to the ground.  BOOTED brutally in the
  head.  Again.  A WOUND trickles blood from her forehead.

    BLURRED VISION as one of the Thugs aims his .9mm at
    "Samantha's" (really Tiffany's) head, and BLASTS a shot. 
  Frank howls for his daughter. 

  CLOSE ON TIFFANY'S FACE

    Terrified, facing away from Frank, as a SECOND BULLET is
    blasted into the dirt, inches from her face.  (Creating the
    illusion, for Frank, that she's been shot in the head).  OFF

                  Tell me their names.  We'll protect

  Nick can tell she wants to talk... but then she freezes up. 
    Looking past Nick.  Nick follows her gaze, to --   

  THE OPEN DOORWAY

  Where a TATTED-UP BADASS is looming, staring in. 

  Nick moves toward the guy. 

                                  NICK
                You a friend of hers?

                  room.  My mistake. 

  With a look to Tiffany, he shuffles off.  Nick turns back to
    Tiffany, but -- 

                                    TIFFANY BAMFORD
                Get out.

    THROUGH THE WINDOW, looking down on the landscape of the
    ABANDONED WILD WEST VILLAGE.  A strip of dilapidated "Old*
  West" buildings. *

  PULL BACK TO FIND Frank, eyes scanning the landscape.

                On fumes man, what are we looking
                  for? 

  Frank shoves his gun into the back of Pilot Harmon's neck. 
  Keeps his eyes working the scene below.

                  Keep going.  

  ON FRANK 

  as he reacts to something coming into sight... 

    FRANK'S POV: TWO BLACK SUVs (Zadian's Cayenne is one) appear
  in the distance.  Tearing across the desert, toward the
    helicopter.  Still a long ways off, but -- 

  Frank spins around, aims the gun at Morgan.

    Morgan's confused, grabs the binoculars.

    MORGAN'S BINOCULAR POV: Honing in on the SUVs, as they
    continue ever closer.  

    Morgan looks at Frank, baffled.  

                                    MORGAN 
                Not cops...

    Again, lifting the binoculars.

    MORGAN'S BINOCULAR POV: FOCUSING IN on one SUV, as its
    PASSENGER-SIDE WINDOW ROLLS DOWN... and an AK-47 BARREL pokes
  out, glinting in the SUN. 

                                    MORGAN

  A BULLET SPIDERS THE WINDOW.  

  Frank and Morgan duck for cover.  Pilot Harmon tries to duck
  and torque the copter around.  It works, for a moment -- the
    copter JOLTING UP, LEANING into a hard turn, gaining elevation --  

  -- Until the SOUND OF THE PROPELLER CEASES.  Nobody breathes.

                                    ACT FOUR

  FADE IN:



  Deja vu.  Back where we began. 

  The THICK HAZE of smoke and churned desert dust is
    impenetrable at first.  But as CAMERA PUSHES into it, a
    HULKING SILHOUETTE looms into existence...  

  THE DESTROYED COPTER.  A tin can crushed into the earth. 
    Propeller blades jutting at insane angles.  Scattered around
  it, broken ROTOR BLADES, shimmering SHATTERED GLASS, and
    cast-off HUNKS of ALUMINUM...  

    CAMERA, WEAVING LOW through this carnage, crests over a hunk
  of aluminum and spies -- an UNCONSCIOUS BODY, lying in the
  haze.  Can't tell who.  As CAMERA MOVES TOWARD the body -- 

  Hear a stir of MOTION behind CAMERA.  A CRUNCH of footstep
  on wreckage.  And then --     

    MORGAN 

    staggers into view.  Her CSI Vest twisted halfway around her
    torso.  She rips the constricting vest off, drops it to the
    ground.  Right where we saw it in the Teaser.  

  As she stumbles forward, toward the heart of the wreckage -- 

    MORGAN'S POV: Vision rattled.  Ears ringing.  Putting one
  foot in front of the other, stumbling toward that unconscious
    body... REVEALED to be PARAMEDIC RILL.  BLOOD POOL widening
  out from under him.    

    Morgan checks Paramedic Rill's pulse.  He's gone.  She looks
  up, toward -- 

  THE COCKPIT

  where a HAND is all that's visible, dangling out of the
    wreckage.  

    Morgan goes to the cockpit.  Discovering whose hand it is -- 

  PILOT KIRK HARMON *

  Still in his captain's chair, head snapped back and half his
  face sheared off by the impact. 

    MORGAN  

  is gut-punched by the sight.    CSI: "CSI Down" - 1205 - WHITE - 8/31/1147.

    CAMERA SWOOPS OVER the oncoming CAVALRY OF RADIO CARS. 
    Finding BRASS' SEDAN, and SWOOPING DOWN, into -- 



    Morgan is out of the cockpit now, trying to decide which way
  to go.  She looks East --    

    MORGAN'S POV: Through the CLEARING HAZE, the Mad-10 SUVs are
    visible.  400 yards off, but tearing their way ever closer.  

  Makes the decision easier.  Morgan spins to head the opposite
    direction.   

    MORGAN'S POV: Ahead, the strip of Old West buildings.  A*
    possible shelter.  

  Just then, she HEARS a HACKING COUGH, and turns to see -- 

  FRANK CAFFERTY

    Stumbling in a daze.  One hand clutching busted ribs, the
  other still holding the gun.  He turns, sees Morgan.   

    A beat, as they look at each other.  Then -- 

                                    MORGAN

  And with a glance back (toward the off-screen SUVs), she's
    moving.  Frank follows. 



  The MAD-10 SUVs come to a dusty stop in front of the Saloon. *

  From one SUV, driver ALEXANDER ZADIAN hops out with his*
    LIEUTENANT.  Both men wielding AK-47s.    *

  The SUV tears off, just as -- *

  TWO RADIO CARS AND BRASS' SEDAN*

    suddenly WHIP AROUND the far corner of Old Main Street,*
    blocking the SUV's way!  Brass and UNIFORMS explode out of*
  the cars, guns trained on all four of the Mad-10s.  

  ANGLE ON - THE MAD-10 SUV

  The banger riding shotgun leans out the window, unloading*
  his AK at the cops -- and the cops OPEN FIRE, ripping him*
    apart.   



  As Morgan emerges from the building, Greg hops out of a
    DENALI, hustles up to her, Nick a step behind him. 

                                  GREG
                  Morgan...

                                    MORGAN

                You hurt? 

  But she just keeps walking, past -- 

  THE SHOT-UP MAD-10 SUV.  Both BANGERS in it dead and bloody.      

    MORGAN continues through the battlefield.  Stepping over the
    dozens of spent CARTRIDGE CASINGS.  Passing... 

  ... a Uniform, standing over the GUNSHOT DEAD BODY of
    ALEXANDER ZADIAN...     

    Morgan takes a few more steps, and then --  

  A CSI DENALI pulls up to her.  Russell the driver.  Ecklie
    shotgun and hopping out, going to his daughter.

96CONTINUED:96

  That last word a surprise to Ecklie, and he hugs her closer...
  which makes Morgan stiffen.  Clamping her emotions.  Pulling
  away from him.    

                                    MORGAN
                  Just need to get out of here. 

  And she opens the front passenger door of the Denali, climbs
  in.  Closes the door.  Leaving Ecklie outside.

                I'm fine. 

  But Russell knows better.  Touches a hand to Morgan's back...
  and Morgan's wall crumbles.  The whole terrifying day crashing
    through her in tears and trembling.  Russell holds her. 
  Looks up, to -- 

  THE PARTIALLY OPEN PASSENGER-SIDE WINDOW

    Ecklie standing there.  Gutted.      

    Russell means it for both father and daughter --

                  Going to be okay.

  he's approaching Ecklie.  Who's watching the Denali drive
  away.  Greg stands beside him, says nothing.
