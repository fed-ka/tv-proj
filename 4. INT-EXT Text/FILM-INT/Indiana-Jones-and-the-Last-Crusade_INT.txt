The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops
several degrees. Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair.
HERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's
drawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.
CONTINUED:
HERMAN
I don't think this is such a good
idea.
LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source.
The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light
of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach
cautiously, careful to stay hidden.
HERMAN
What is it?
This is what they see:
FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the
pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas."
The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery
Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his
shoulders).
And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT
FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet
anything that this is INDLANA JONES.
However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow,
we are shocked to discover that it is someone else.
We'll call him FEDORA.
TITLES END.
The TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.
Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES.
FEDORA
Alfred, did you get anything yet?
MAN
Nothing. Dig in.
Two of the men stand and look at ROSCOE who steps forward holding a box in his
hands.
ROSCOE
Hey, I've got something!
Whoops from the other men.
ROSCOE
I got something, Garth!
CONTINUED: (2)
ROSCOE rushes forward and gives FEDORA the box. Fedora steps toward a
lantern resting on a rock.
ROSCOE
I got something... I got something
right here.
More whoops from the other men.
FEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes
ROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the
box as Fedora opens it.
ROSCOE
(more whoops; then)
Oh, look at thatl
(more whoops)
We're richl We're rich!
HALFBREED
Shut up. Shut up.
FEDORA takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's
comrades practically salivate at the sight of it.
ROSCOE (O.S.)
Well, we're rich, ain't we?l
INDY takes off his hat and looks down at the o.s. action.
HERMAN
Indy? Indy? What are they doing?
Indiana? Indiana?
INDY
Shhhl
FEDORA blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its
beauty... and its value. He seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to
them.
HALFBREED
Hey, we got to find more stuff
to bring back.
INDY stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.
INDY
(hushed; urgent)
It's the Cross of Coronadol
Cortes gave it to him in 15201
CONTINUED: (3)
FEDORA continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the rock next to its box
and the lantern.
INDY turns back to observe the men.
INDY
That Cross is an important artifact.
It belongs in a museum.
A look of resolve comes into INDY's expression, and he turns back toward
HERMAN.
INDY
Run back and find the others.
Tell Mister Havelock that there
are men looting in the caves.
HERMAN doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror
as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.
INDY
Have him bring the sheriff.
INDY matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. HERMAN gasps.
INDY
It's only a snake.
INDY grabs HERMAN's scout scarf and pulls him closer.
INDY
Did you hear what I said?
HERMAN
Right. Run back. Mister Havelock.
The Sheriff. What, what are you
gonna do?
INDY
I don't know... I'll think of
something.
INDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees
the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for
additional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of
the Cross...
FEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.
FEDORA
Dig with your hands.
INDY picks up the Cross.
CONTINUED: (4)
FEDORA (O . S . )
Not with your mouth.
As FEDORA stands watching the other men digging, INDY puts the Cross in his
pants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's
feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention.
ROSCOE
He's got our thing!
HALFBREED
Get 'im!
The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock
each other over in the attempt.
Only FEDORA is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in
the direction of his fleeing companionsthen sets off
after INDY.
and finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the car's ceiling.
Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing all manner of reptiles:
Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc.
CONTINUED:
Then, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap doorfollowed by ROUGH RIDER.
Halfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp.
INDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at
Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.
The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended
for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.
Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL
BOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's
end of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.
He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye-
to-eye with an
ENORMOUS ANACONDA
The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
INDY
Oh...
INDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.
INDY
Oh... Oh...
Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him.
Engulf him. Almost smother him.
INDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.
INDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape.
HALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans.
ROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.
ROUGH RIDER
Here, let me.
as a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a HUGE
BLACK RHINOCEROS.
INDY CRASHES down from above. Dust rises.
INDY
Ohhh!
INDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in
through the cracks between the boards.
Then INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an
AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust
swirls up into the shafts of sunlight.
And INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged
from his belt during the fall...
INDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He
carefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.
INDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP
flying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.
The Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and
tries again. This timesuccess! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion
BELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.
INDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs
away even more. Indy inches forwardbends down (never taking his eyes off
the Lion)picks up the Crossand steps back again, sweat pouring down his
face.
But now... how to get out?
He looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING
DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.
FEDORA
Toss up the whip.
which contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. INDY rushes to the rear door of
the caboose but can't open it. He hears FEDORA coming, and dives into a MAGIC
BOX.
FEDORA
Okay, kid. out of the box.
Now.
FEDORA smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly
collapses; all four sides flop away... revealing NOTHING. INDY has completely
vanished.
FEDORA is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a breeze at his back.
He turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the
balcony and sees:
INDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.
FEDORA
Damn.
INDY bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky
BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father.
INDY
Dad!
INDY
Dad!
INDY charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, charts and maps
clearly reflect the father's passion for Medieval studies.
PROFESSOR HENRY JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he is studying a very
ancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. The page shows a
beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window. The
sketch incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just
studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook.
CONTINUED:
We never get to see the PROFESSOR's face in this scene.
So INDY CHARGES IN.
INDY
Dad!
HENRY
Out!
INDY
It's important!
HENRY
Then waitcount to twenty.
INDY
No, Dad. You listen to me
HENRY
(now he shouts)
Junior!
No question who is the boss here. INDY gulps, his look says "What am I going to
do with this guy?" And obeys
starts counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY.
INDY
One, two, three, four...
Now we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand
sketching; then, he holds up one finger.
HENRY
In Greek.
INDY's reaction:
INDY
(louder, in Greek)
One... two... three... four...
An ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps INDY glimpses it going past the
window. Anyway, it stops outside the house. Two men sit in the front seat.
HERMAN sits in the rear, BLOWING A TRUMPET.
INDY's reaction: Trouble!
HENRY is just finishing the sketch.
HENRY
May he who illuminated this...
illuminate me...
The study door is just closing, INDY closing it behind him... just as HERMAN
comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet.
INDY reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from HERMAN's mouth. Herman
continues to spitright into Indy's face. Indy flinches.
HERMAN
I brought the Sheriff.
HERMAN means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house.
INDY
Just the man I want to see! Now,
there were five or six of them.
SHERIFF
(interrupting)
All right, son.
INDY
(overlapping)
... they came after... me...
SHERIFF
You still got it?
INDY
Well, yes, sir. It's right here!
INDY shows the CROSS, more or less handing it to the SHERIFF to make his
point. The Sheriff takes it casually.
SHERIFF
I'm glad to see that... because
the rightful owner of this Cross
won't press charges, if you give
it back.
FEDORA enters the house, followed by ROSCOE, ROUGH RIDER and HALFBREED.
He politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand. He nods at INDY in a
friendly manner.
SHERIFF
He's got witnesses, five or six
of them.
The SHERIFF and FEDORA are in Cahoots
The SHERIFF hands the Cross to FEDORA. ROSCOE reaches in and takes it from
Fedora, then runs out the door.
ROSCOE
Yahoo!
CONTINUED:
As ROSCOE runs outside INDY seesthrough the screen doorthe MAN IN
THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car that is parked out front.
Roscoe approaches and gives the Man the Crossthe Man hands Roscoe some
money in exchange.
The SHERIFF tips his hat and leaves.
SHERIFF
Good day.
FEDORA remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to INDY in an ironic
man-to-man way.
FEDORA
You lost today, kid, but that
doesn't mean you have to like it.
Then, FEDORA takes off his hat and takes a step towards INDY. He holds the hat
by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for
the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face.
CLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE FEDORA HAT
The hat brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, WE SEE the face of FULL
GROWN INDIANA JONES.
And... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his
back.
FADE IN TITLE: "PORTUGUESE COAST1938"
PANAMA HAT
Small world, Doctor Jones.
INDY
Too small for two of us.
THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT (years older now) removes the CROSS OF
CORONADO from Indy's belt.
PANAMA HAT
This is the second time I've had
to reclaim my property from you
INDY
That belongs in a museum
PANAMA HAT
So do you.
(he moves his eyeline)
Throw him over the side.
THE DECK OF A PORTUGUESE CARGO SHIP
It's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent STORM AT SEA.
Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck.
The TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back)
propel INDY across the deck toward the rail.
As they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, INDY uses the Two Sailors as leverage
to KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on the metal bands that hold
the drums together.
INDY jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors and rushes toward
the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT.
PANAMA HAT sees INDY coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to
the bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes
his way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder
from behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the cross back from
Panama Hat.
A sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending the cross flying out of
his grip and skittering across the deck. Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two
sailors who attack him from the sides.
INDY sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He lunges for it.
He SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave.
He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the
deck around him.
SEVERAL MORE DRUMS come INDY's way. He sidesteps them all.
PANAMA HAT
Grab him, he's getting away!
Grab him!
Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. Indy sees a large
Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a
hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly
avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still
holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly
onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending
an enormous orange fireball into the sky.
LONG SHOT - THE BOAT EXPLODING OUT OF THE WATER
as bits of debris fall from the sky like rain.
INDY BOBS UP
in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for
something to keep him afloat. It turns out to be one of the ship's LIFE
PRESERVERS. INDY loops his arm through the preserver.
CONTINUED:
Only now do we see the FADED LETTERING on the preserver revealing the
destroyed ship's name and city of port:
VAZQUEZ de CORONADO
BARCELONA
A SHREDDED PANAMA HAT floats past.
DISSOLVE TO:
INDY, dressed in professorial tweeds, stands before his class. He turns to the
blackboard with a piece of chalk and writes the word: "FACT."
INDY
... the search for fact. Not truth.
If it's truth you're interested
in, Doctor Tyree's Philosophy
class is right down the hall.
Laughter.
INDY
So forget any ideas you've got
about lost cities, exotic travel,
and digging up the world. Eve
do not follow maps to buried
treasure and "X" never, ever,
marks the spot.
MARCUS BRODY approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through the window in
the door to see INDY completing his lecture.
INDY
Seventy percent of all archaeology
is done in the library. Research.
Reading.
BRODY enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room.
CONTINUED:
INDY
We cannot afford to take mythology
at face value.
The BELL RINGS. INDY stands at his desk as students begin to disperse. A
pretty coed puts a note on the desk.
INDY
Next week: "Egyptology." Starting
with the excavation of Naukratis
by Blinders Petrie in 1885. I will
be in my office if anybody's got
any problems for the next hour
and a half.
BRODY approaches as the last of the students leaves the lecture hall.
INDY
Marcus!
(slaps his pocket)
I did it!
BRODY
You've got itl
INDY removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places it on the desk
and takes off his glasses as BRODY examines the Cross.
INDY
You know how long I've been
looking for that?!
BRODY
All your life.
INDY
All my life!
BRODY
Well done, Indy. Very well done,
indeed This will find a place
of honor in our Spanish collection.
INDY gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door.
INDY
We can discuss my honorarium over
dinner and champagne tonight.
He turns back toward BRODY, now holding the Cross.
INDY
Your treat.
BRODY
Yes. My treat.
Bursting with STUDENTS, all competing for his attention at once: "Professor
Jones! " "Doctor Jonesl " etc., etc.
INDY
Shush! Shush! Shushl
INDY shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an overwhelmed Teaching
Assistant named IRENE.
IRENE
Doctor Jones! I'm so glad you're
back! Your mail is on your desk.
Here are your phone messages.
MALE STUDENT
Doctor Jones, you promised...
Doctor Jones
IRENE
This is your appointment schedule.
And these term papers still haven't
been graded.
INDY takes the term papers then turns to enter his PRIVATE OFFICE. Students
once again CLAMOR for his attention: "Doctor Jones!" "Wait, Doctor Jonesl"
"My grade!" "Sign my registration card!"
INDY silences the mob with a raised hand.
INDY
(very efficiently)
Okay. Irene, put everyone's name
on a list, in the order they
arrived, and I'll see each and
every one of them in turn.
The Students descend upon poor IRENE, each claiming to be first. INDY slips into
his -
PRIVATE OFFICE
where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it.
INDY
(softly; reading)
"Venice, Italy."
Then, INDY stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the WINDOW, slides it
open and STEPS OUT INTO THE GARDEN.
INDY is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone. Numerous
museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room. Indy takes this
opportunity to examine them.
After a moment, WALTER DONOVAN enters from across the room. During the
brief time that the door is open, we HEAR a COCKTAIL PARTY going on in the
next room: VOICES and SOFT PIANO MUSIC.
DONOVAN strides across the room toward INDY. Although in his late fifties,
Donovan has the broad shoulders and trim physique of a much younger man.
Dressed in a tuxedo, he exudes both confidence and power.
DONOVAN
I trust your trip down was
comfortable, Doctor Jones. My
men didn't alarm you, I hope.
He shakes hands with INDY.
DONOVAN
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
INDY
I know who you are Mr. Donovan.
Your contributions to the museum
over the years have been extremely
generous. Some of the pieces in
your collection here are very
impressive.
DONOVAN
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones,
I have a passion for antiquities.
(beat)
Have a look over here. This might
interest you.
CONTINUED:
DONOVAN goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth. He throws back
the cloth revealing a flat STONE TABLETabout two feet square, inscribed with
letters and symbols.
INDY looks impressed. He puts on his glasses to make a closer examination.
INDY
Well, it's sandstone. Christian
symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-
Twelfth Century, I should think.
DONOVAN
That was our assessment as well.
INDY
Where did this come from?
DONOVAN
My engineers unearthed it in the
mountain region north of Ankara
while excavating for copper.
(beat)
Can you translate the inscription?
Translating the inscription is no easy matter, even for someone as knowledgeable
as INDY.
INDY
(stumbling through it)
"... who drinks the water I shall
give him, says the Lord, will have
a spring inside him welling up
for eternal life. Let them bring
me to your holy mountain in the
place where you dwell.
Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy reads.
INDY
Across the desert and through
the mountain to the Canyon of
the Crescent Moon, to the Temple
where the cup that"
Suddenly INDY stops and looks up at DONOVAN with a startled expression.
INDY
"Where the cup that holds the
blood of Jesus Christ resides
forever. "
(CONT'D)
CONTINUED: (2)
DONOVAN
(reverently)
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones.
The chalice used by Christ during
the Last Supper. The cup that
caught His blood at the Crucifixion
and was entrusted to Joseph of
Arimathaea.
INDY rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne
DONOVAN now offers him.
INDY
The Arthur Legend. I've heard
this bedtime story before.
DONOVAN
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The
gift of youth to whoever drinks
from the Grail.
(beat)
Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd
like to wake up to!
INDY
An old man's dream.
DONOVAN
Every man's dream.
(beat)
Including your father's, I believe.
INDY stiffens slightly at the mention of his father, nods.
INDY
Grail lore is his hobby.
He's a teacher of Medieval
Literature. The one the students
hope they don't get.
The door opens and MRS. DONOVAN steps into the room. She's a matronly
woman in an expensive evening gown.
MRS. DONOVAN
Walter, you're neglecting our
guests.
DONOVAN
Be along in a moment, dear.
He leans over and kisses her cheek. MRS. DONOVAN sighs to herself and returns
to the party. INDY, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet,
obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with
champagne and rubs it over the tablet. DONOVAN steps up next to Indy.
CONTINUED: (3)
DONOVAN
Hard to resist, isn't it? The
Holy Grail's final resting place
described in detail!
INDY
What good is it? This Grail
Tablet speaks of deserts and
mountains and canyons. Pretty
vague. Where do you start
looking? Maybe if the Tablet were
intact, you'd have something to
go on. But the entire top
portion is missing.
DONOVAN
Just the same, an attempt to
recover the Grail is currently
underway.
INDY has to shake his head at DONOVAN's apparent lack of judgment.
DONOVAN
Let me tell you another "bedtime
story, " Doctor Jones.
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathaea, it
disappeared and was lost for a
thousand years before it was found
again by three Knights of the
First Crusade. Three brothers,
to be exact.
INDY
I've heard this one as well.
Two of these brothers walked out
of the desert one hundred and
fifty years after having found
the Grail and began the long
journey back to France. But
only one of them made it. And
before dying of extreme old
age, he supposedly imparted
his tale to ato a Franciscan
friar, I think.
DONOVAN
Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.
DONOVAN produces an ANCIENT LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME with very brittle
pages. INDY views the manuscript with considerable interest.
CONTINUED: (4)
DONOVAN
This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the Knight's
story... it doesn't reveal on
location of the Grail, I'm afraid...
but the Knight promised that two
"markers" that had been left
behind would.
(indicates the Tablet)
This Tablet is one of those
"markers." It proves the Knight's
story is true. But as you pointed
outit's incomplete.
(beat)
Now, the second "marker" is
entombed with the Knight's dead
brother. Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located
within the city of Venice, Italy.
(beat)
As you can now see, Doctor Jones,
we're about to complete a great
quest that began almost two
thousand years ago. We're only
one step away.
INDY
That's usually when the ground
falls out from underneath your
feet.
DONOVAN
You could be more right than you
know.
INDY
Yes?
DONOVAN
We've hit a snag. our project
leader has vanished. Along with
all his research. Uh, we received
a cable from his colleague, Doctor
Schneider, who has no idea of his
whereabouts or what's become of
him.
(beat)
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off. Find the man
and you will find the Grail.
CONTINUED: (5)
INDY
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister
Donovan. Why don't you try my
father?
DONOVAN
(after a pause)
We already have. Your father is
the man who's disappeared.
INDY approaches the half-open front door.
INDY
Dad?
(to BRODY)
He's an academic A bookworm.
He's not a field mans
He pushes open the door. He enters the house and calls out.
INDY
Dad? Dad?
INDY opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room.
We see the place has been ransacked.
CONTINUED:
BRODY sees INDY's face and opens the other half.
BRODY
Dear God.
They walk into the room.
BRODY
What has the old fool got
himself into now?
INDY
I don't know. But whatever it
is, he's in over his head!
BRODY picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk.
INDY
Dad?
BRODY
It's today's mail. And it's been
opened.
INDY turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes. Then something hits
him.
INDY
Mail! That's it, Marcus!
He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from
his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark.
INDY
(as he tears it open)
Venice, Italy!
BRODY
What is it?
INDY uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or
DIARY. Indy flips through it: Page after page of
handwritten notes and drawings. BRODY glances at it with
great curiosity.
INDY
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every
clue he ever followed. Every
discovery he made. A complete
record of his search for the Holy
Grail. This is his whole life.
Why would he have sent this to me?
CONTINUED: (2)
BRODY
I don't know. But someone must
want it pretty badly.
INDY
Do you believe, Marcus?
As INDY asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the wall: A depiction of
Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice.
A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting
to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair
because he holds the Grail in his hands.
INDY
Do you believe the Grail actually
exists?
BRODY
The search for the Cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all
of us.
BRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response.
BRODY
But if you want facts, Indy, I
have none to give you. At my age,
I'm prepared to take a few things
on faith.
INDY
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him
I'll take that ticket to Venice
now.
BRODY
I'll tell him we'll take two.
INDY opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages. He stops
at one page and glances at a PENCIL SKETCH of what might be a stained-glass
window. Below the sketch is a SERIES OF NUMBERS.
INDY, BRODY and ELSA enter, their heels CLICKING across the marble floor.
We notice, along with INDY and BRODY, that the library contains many stained-
glass windows.
ELSA
In this case it's the literal
truth. We're on holy ground.
These columns over here...
She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to ceiling.
ELSA
... were brought back as spoils
of war after the sacking of
Byzantium during the Crusades.
CONTINUED:
INDY glances at the Columns, then notices a Stained-Glass Window that depicts a
Knight of the Crusades. Indy lingers for a moment in front of the window.
ELSA
Now please excuse me. The library's
closing in a few moments. I'll
arrange for us to stay a little
longer.
The minute ELSA is out of earshot.
INDY
MarcusI've seen this window
before.
BRODY
Where?
INDY whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the
airplane.
INDY
Right here. In Dad's Diary.
You see?
BRODY glances at the Diary, then at the windownoticing that the Roman
numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.
BRODY
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
INDY
Dad was onto something here!
BRODY
Well, now we know the source of
the numbers, but we still don't
know what they mean.
INDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back
into his pocket.
INDY
(explaining to Brody)
My dad sent me this Diary for a
reason. Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
ELSA
Find something?
INDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving
across the walls and ceilingscharged with the thrill of discovery.
CONTINUED: (2)
BRODY
(to ELSA)
Uh, yes. Three, seven and tent
That window seems to be the source
of the Roman numerals.
ELSA
My God, I must be blind
INDY
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the Knight's Tomb... he was
looking for the Tomb itself
ELSA wears a blank expression.
INDY
Don't you get it? The Tomb is
somewhere in the library! You
said yourself it used to be a
church! Look.
INDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.
INDY
Three.
INDY looks again to the stained-glass window. He points.
INDY
Three!
INDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy
hurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep
up with him.
INDY
Seven.
He points again to the stained-glass window.
INDY
Seven... Ten.
He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.
INDY
And ten. Now where's the ten?
Look around for the ten.
INDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down.
CONTINUED: (3)
INDY
Three, seven and ten.
He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at BRODY and
ELSA. The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge
"X"visible only from this higher angle.
INDY
Ten.
(wryly; to himself)
"X" marks the spot.
INDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two
sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up,
but cannot.
INDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath
the stained-glass window.
INDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the
Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously.
INDY continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still
puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the library.
Finally INDY breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a
TWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED.
Cold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole.
INDY
Bingo.
ELSA
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones.
You're a great deal like your
father.
INDY
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
ELSA
Lower me down.
INDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeablyholding her by
the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground
below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY.
INDY
Look after this for me, will you?
Then INDY disappears into the hole.
INDY jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help ELSA.
INDY
Come on.
INDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank.
foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory
four-leaf clover design.
INDY and ELSA inspect markings carved onto the walls.
ELSA
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth
Century.
INDY
Right. Six hundred years before
the Crusades.
ELSA
The Christians would have dug
their own passages and burial
chambers centuries later.
INDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway.
INDY
That's right. If there's a
Knight of the First Crusade
entombed down here, that's where
we'll find him.
THREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an
unsuspecting BRODY. One of the Men, KAZIM, raises his gun and brings it down
hard on Brody's head.
BRODY
Ohhhh. . .
KAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two
men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles.
DECOMPOSING CORPSES rest in niches carved into the stone walls. Grotesque
skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones.
INDY holds the lighter up as he and ELSA inspect symbols carved into the walls.
CONTINUED:
ELSA spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't recognize. As she blows
away some cobwebs:
ELSA
What's this one?
INDY only has to give it a quick glance to know.
INDY
The Ark of the Covenant.
ELSA
Are you sure?
INDY
(deadpan)
Pretty sure.
INDY holds the lighter up and he and ELSA enter another dark passageway.
ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
INDY steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. He scrapes the cobwebs
away to reveal the ROMAN NUMERAL "X."
INDY
Watch out.
ELSA now holds the lighter as INDY rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall
collapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room.
ANOTHER ROOM - THE CATACOMBS
as INDY falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling,
green, slimy liquid. More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches.
ELSA holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall.
INDY
Petroleum. I could sink a well
down here and retire.
INDY reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which
breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water.
INDY uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then
dips into the oily water.
INDY
Give me the lighter.
ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, INDY and ELSA come
upon a NARROW PASSAGEWAY. The water is knee-deep and TEEMING WITH
RATS. Thousands of them Crawling on one another's backs. SQUEALING.
Squirming. Thrashing in the water.
INDY
Oh, rats...
ELSA gasps as the rats scamper between her legs.
INDY moves forward through the rat-infested water as ELSA follows, still gasping
in horror. Suddenly he slips into a hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out
to Elsa.
INDY
Come onl
She gasps once again, terrified. INDY lifts her and carries ELSA as he moves
forward.
THE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL
KAZIM and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their
flashlights through to the rat-infested water.
ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
More rat-infested water as ELSA, now walking again, follows INDY through
another passageway lined with skulls and bones.
INDY reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. A
bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all
directions.
He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to ELSA's
side. He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same.
INDY
Come here.
LARGE BURIAL CHAMBER
The chamber is flooded with black, briny water.
INDY
Look. . .
In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an
"island altar" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT COFFINS rest. They move toward the
altar.
CONTINUED:
INDY and ELSA begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of
antiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of
etched brass.
INDY
It must be one of these...
ELSA
Look at the artistry of these
carvings and the scrollwork.
One coffin is elevated above the others.
ELSA
It's this one.
Together they begin to push on the lidSTRAINING and GROANING until it
slides away and BANGS against the stone platform.
INSIDE THE COFFIN
lie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. INDY and ELSA look
in...Elsa gasps.
INDY
This is itl we found it! Look
the engraving on the Shield. It's
the same as on the Grail Tablets
The Shield is the Second Marker!
INDY unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.
ELSA
What's that?
INDY
It's a rubbing Dad made of the
Grail Tablet.
The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.
ELSA
Just like your fathergiddy
as a schoolboy.
INDY laughs.
ELSA
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he
were here now to see this?
INDY
(chuckles)
He never would have made it past
the rats!
He hates rats!
He's
scared to death of them!
CLOSE - A HAND
as it lights a match.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick
water.
INDY AND ELSA
ELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And
then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls.
This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the
Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDYSHRIEKING and
SQUEALING as they approach.
The rats literally wash over themlike a rodent tidal wavein their efforts to
escape a:
HUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE
ROARING around the corner hurtling towards themfeeding on the oil slick;
consuming the oxygen.
ELSA SCREAMS.
INDY
Get back! Back against the wall.
INDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet.
It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water.
INDY
Quick! Under it!
They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin.
INDY
Air pocket!
ELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath.
UNDER THE COFFIN
ELSA surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and
SPITTING.
Now INDY pops up into the air pocket. He looks at ELSAthey are both soaking
wet.
INDY
Don't wander off.
CONTINUED:
ELSA
What?
INDY disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin.
ELSA
What?
UNDER THE WATER
INDY swims, looking for an escape route.
UNDER THE COFFIN
The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water
and climbing on ELSA, who squirms and screams in terror.
INDY pops back up through the water.
INDY
I think I've found a way out.
Deep breath.
ELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water.
INDY fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a
Turkish Agent JUMPS in with him.
ELSA grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while INDY and the Turk trade
punches.
CLOSE ON THE WATER-SOAKED PAPER IMPRESSION: The rubbing taken from
the shield of the Grail Knight.
BRODY is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head
with an ice pack.
INDY
How's the head?
BRODY
It's better, now I've seen this.
It's the name of a city.
"Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
INDY, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.
INDY
The Knights of the First Crusade
laid siege to the city of
Alexandretta for over a year.
The entire city was destroyed.
BRODY lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at INDY.
INDY
The present city of Iskenderun
is built on its ruins. Marcus
you remember what the Grail
Tablet said. "Across the desert
and through the mountain to the
Canyon of the Crescent Moon."
(pause)
But where exactly?
CONTINUED:
BRODY
Your father would know. Your
father did know. Look. He
made a map.
BRODY picks up the Grail Diary.
BRODY
He must have pieced it together
from clues scattered through the
whole history of the Grail Quest.
A map with no names.
INSERT: A PENCIL-DRAWN MAP
It covers two pages of the Diary. BRODY's finger moves across it.
BRODY
Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east. Here.
He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river, and
the river led into the mountains.
Here. Straight to the canyon.
He knew everything except where
to begin, the name of the city.
INDY
(solemnly)
Alexandretta. Now we know.
BRODY
Yes. Now we know.
INDY
(rising)
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell
him to meet you in Iskenderun.
INDY closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe.
BRODY
What about you?
INDY
I'm going after Dad.
INDY opens the door. His bedroom has been ransacked...the mattress on the
floor, the drawers turned out.
INDY approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks.
INDY
Elsa?
He goes in.
... and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. The
room is empty.
He is worried for her, knocks and calls out:
INDY
Elsa?
He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door.
INDY
Elsa?
He opens the bathroom door, peering inside.
INDY
Elsa?
Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as
INDY enters. He retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a
record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub.
ELSA joins INDY, waiting in the ransacked room. she looks around in shock.
ELSA
My room!
INDY
Mine, too.
ELSA
What were they looking for?
She looks to INDY, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket.
INDY
This.
CONTINUED:
ELSA
The Grail Diary.
INDY
Uh-huh.
ELSA
You had it? You didn't trust
me!
She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.
INDY
I didn't know you.
She's awfully hard to resist.
INDY
At least I let you tag along.
ELSA
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and
they'll follow you anywhere.
INDY
Knock it off. You're not mad.
ELSA
No?
INDY
No. You like the way I do things.
ELSA
It's lucky I don't do things the
same way. You'd still be standing
at the Venice pier.
She stomps her foot angrily. INDY flinches. She starts to walk away but Indy
grabs her.
INDY
Look, what do you think is going
on here? Since I've met you,
I've nearly been incinerated,
drowned, shot at, and chopped into
fish bait. We're caught in the
middle of something sinister here.
My guess is Dad found out more
than he was looking for. And
until I'm sure, I'm going to
continue to do things the way I
think they should be done.
CONTINUED: (2)
He pulls her to him and kisses her.
ELSA
How dare you kiss me!
Now ELSA reaches for INDY and kisses him.
INDY
Leave me alone. I don't like
fast women.
But he embraces her, and ELSA begins to nibble at his ear.
ELSA
And I hate arrogant men.
INDY smiles slyly as they fall to the bed.
INDY lies on top of ELSA, kissing her. He stops for a moment as he hears the
GONDOLIER SINGING.
INDY
Ahh, Venice.
ELSA reaches up and pulls him back down to her.
INDY reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip.
ELSA
What are you going to do?
INDY
Don't know. Think of something.
He glances up to the beret ELSA is wearing. She reaches up and adjusts it.
A BUTLER walks to the door and opens it to reveal INDY and ELSA standing
outside in the rain. she now wears Indy's fedora; Indy is wearing Elsa's beret.
BUTLER
Yes?
INDY, followed by ELSA, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat. He
adopts a Scottish accent.
INDY
And not before time! Did you
intend to leave us standing on
the doorstep all day? We're
drenched!
As INDY says this he pushes his way past the startled BUTLER, pulling a
handkerchief from the man's pocket. ELSA follows, taking off her coat. INDY
SNEEZES HARD.
INDY
Now look! I've gone and caught
a sniffle.
INDY dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as ELSA looks on in amused
amazement.
BUTLER
(coldly; with
Austrian accent)
Are you expected?
INDY
Don't take that tone with me, my
good man. Now buttle off and tell
Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence
MacDonald and his lovely assistant
are here to view the tapestries.
(CONT'D)
CONTINUED:
BUTLER
Tapestries?
INDY
Dear me, the man is dense. This
is a castle, isn't it? There are
tapestries?
BUTLER
This is a castle. And we have
many tapestries. But if you're a
Scottish lord, then I am Mickey
Mouse.
INDY
How dare he?!
Simultaneously knocking the BUTLER cold with one slug on the jaw. The Butler
falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold.
INDY and ELSA move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway.
APPROACHING VOICES ARE HEARD. Indy and Elsa creep past a room full of
NAZI SOLDIERS working around a large table with a map atop it..
INDY reacts to the sight of them.
INDY
(to ELSA; softly)
Nazis. I hate these guys.
INDY and ELSA continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and
his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens.
INDY
This one. I think he's in here.
ELSA
How do you know?
INDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE.
INDY
Because it's wired.
He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other
doors. He knocks at the doorthere is no response. He looks back at ELSA and
enters.
The room is dark and empty. INDY throws open the window shutters and looks
out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window
but below that is a SHEER DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge,
which is several yards away.
ELSA
Indy? Indy?
INDY reassures her.
INDY
Don't worry... this is kid's play.
I'll be right back.
He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude
from the castle wall above the next window.
He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight.
INDY CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. The broken
shutters hang by their hinges. Rain and cold air whip through the open window.
No sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a VASE COMES CRASHING DOWN ON
THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.
Stunned, INDY sinks to one knee... and Indy's father, PROFESSOR HENRY JONES,
steps out of the shadows.
HENRY
Junior?
INDY gets to his feet.
INDY
(a reflex)
Yes, sirl
CONTINUED:
This reply is a kneejerk reaction on Indy's part. Now they look at each other.
HENRY
It is you Junior!
INDY
(an old familiar
irritation)
Don't call me that, please.
HENRY
(amazed)
But what are you doing here?
INDY
I came to get you! What do you
think?
NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. INDY and HENRY press themselves
against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand.
INDY steps to the window and looks down. HENRY moves to a lamp, holding the
vase under the light for a closer look.
HENRY
(sotto, mumbled)
Late Fourteenth Century, Ming
Dynasty.
HENRY is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand. Father and
son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments.
HENRY
Oh, it breaks the heart.
INDY
(quietly to himself)
And the head.
(to HENRY, aggrievedly)
You hit me, Dad!
HENRY
(referring to the
vase)
I'll never forgive myself
INDY
(surprised,
misunderstanding)
Don't worryI'm fine.
HENRY
Thank God!
CONTINUED: (2)
HENRY has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... he is examining the
broken end carefully.
HENRY
... it's fake. See, you can tell
by the cross section.
HENRY throws the vase against the wall where it SHATTERS.
INDY
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've
got to get out of here.
HENRY
Well, I am sorry about your head,
though. But I thought you were
one of them.
INDY
Dad, they come in through the
doors.
HENRY
(laughs)
Good point.
INDY steps to the door and stands, listening.
HENRY
But better safe than sorry.
HENRY slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.
HENRY
Humpfso I was wrong this time.
But by God, I wasn't wrong when I
mailed you my Diary. You obviously
got it.
INDY
I got it and I used it. We found
the entrance to the catacombs.
HENRY
(excited)
Through the library?
INDY
Right.
HENRY
I knew it. And the tomb of Sir
Richard?
CONTINUED: (3)
INDY nods.
INDY
Found it.
HENRY
(breathless)
He was actually there? You saw
him?
INDY
Well, what was left of him.
HENRY
(trembling with
anticipation)
And his shield... the inscription
on Sir Richard's shield...?
INDY
Alexandretta.
(beat)
It's a great moment in HENRY's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a
moment, then turns to INDY with joy.
HENRY
Alexandretta... of course... on
the pilgrim trail from the Eastern
Empire. Oh, Junior...
INDY winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the moment.
HENRY
... you did it.
INDY
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
HENRY
If only I could have been with
you.
INDY
There were rats, Dad.
HENRY
Rats?
INDY
Yeah. big ones. What do the
Nazis want with you Dad?
HENRY
They want my diary.
CONTINUED: (4)
INDY
(interested)
Yeah?
INDY's interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes.
HENRY
I knew I had to get that book as
far away from me as I possibly
could.
INDY's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. His eyes turn inward.
INDY
(thoughtfully)
Yeah. . .
Then... BAMI The door is kicked open and three NAZIS enter. One is an S.S.
OFFICER. The other two are SOLDIERS with machine guns. HENRY and INDY
raise their hands.
S.S. OFFICER
Doctor Jones!!
HENRY & INDY
Yes!!
S.S. OFFICER
I will take the book now.
INDY/HENRY
(simultaneously)
What book?
S.S. OFFICER
(to INDY)
You have the Diary in your pocket.
HENRY laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the
S.S. OFFICER.
HENRY
You doltl Do you think that my
son would be that stupid that
he would bring my Diary all the
way back here?
At which point an awful thought strikes HENRY.
HENRY
You didn't, did you?
(a beat)
You didn't bring it, did you?
CONTINUED: (5)
INDY
Well, uh...
HENRY
You did!!
INDY
Look, can we discuss this later?
HENRY
I should have mailed it to the
Marx Brothers.
INDY
(overlapping)
Will you take it easy....!
HENRY
Take it easy?! Why do you think
I sent it home in the first place?
(points towards
the NAZIS)
So it wouldn't fall into their
hands!!
INDY
I came here to save you.
HENRY
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to
save you, Junior??
INDY's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally RIPS A
MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the startled soldiers... and for a moment
we think he's going to use it on his dad.
INDY
I told you--
He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three NAZIS to
ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room.
INDY
--don't call me Junior!
HENRY looks shocked and horrified.
HENRY
Look what you did!!
Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead.
HENRY
(aghast)
I can't believe what you just....
INDY leads HENRY down the hallway as he searches for Elsa.
INDY
Elsa? Elsa?
He opens a door and enters:
INDY and HENRY rush back into the room where ELSA had been left, only to
find: A Nazi COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE.
His name is VOGEL: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. One arm is wrapped
around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a LUGER behind her
ear.
VOGEL
That's far enough Put down the
gun, Doctor Jones. Put down the
gun or the Fraulein dies.
HENRY
But she's one of them!
ELSA
Indy, please!
HENRY
She's a Nazi!
INDY
What?!
INDY
is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at ELSA, then back to his
father. Everyone is yelling at once:
HENRY
Trust me!
ELSA
Indy, no!
VOGEL
I will kill her!
HENRY
Oh yeah? Go ahead!
INDY
No! Don't Shoot!
CONTINUED:
HENRY
(to Indy)
Don't worry. He won't.
ELSA
Indy, please! Do what he says!
HENRY
And don't listen to her!
VOGEL
Enough! She diesl
VOGEL jams the barrel of the luger painfully into ELSA's neck. Elsa SCREAMS.
INDY
Wait!
Waitl
And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides
across, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly.
VOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled
directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest.
ELSA
I'm sorry.
INDY comforts her.
INDY
No, don't be.
Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary.
ELSA
But you should have listened to
your father.
She steps back next to VOGEL. INDY is stunned. HENRY gives him his most
withering look of reprimand.
A large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor.
Firelightfrom the giant fireplacedances across the ceiling and walls.
INDY and HENRY are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by VOGEL
and ELSA and TWO NAZI GUARDS.
ELSA crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace. INDY and
HENRY do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair. They
only see a HAND REACH OUT AND TAKE THE BOOK.
CONTINUED:
INDY
(quietly to HENRY)
She ransacked her own room and I
fell for it. How did you know
she was a Nazi?
HENRY
Umh?
INDY
How did you she was a Nazi?
HENRY
She talks in her sleep.
INDY nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He looks at HENRY
with surprise.
HENRY
I didn't trust her. Why did
you?
MAN IN CHAIR
Because he didn't take my advice.
The MAN IN THE CHAIR gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be...
WALTER DONOVAN. INDY and HENRY react with stunned expressions.
INDY
Donovan
DONOVAN
Didn't I warn you not to trust
anybody, Doctor Jones?
DONOVAN smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.
HENRY
I misjudged you WalterI knew
you'd sell your mother for an
Etruscan vase.
But I didn't know you'd sell your
country and your soul to the slime
of humanity.
DONOVAN
(suddenly erupting)
Doctor Schneider There're pages
torn out of thisl
ELSA rushes to DONOVAN's side. she takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes
a look for herselfthen glances up at Indy.
CONTINUED: (2)
ELSA
This book contained a mapa
map with no namesprecise
directions from the unknown city
to the secret Canyon of the
Crescent Moon.
INDY
So it did.
DONOVAN
Where are these missing pages?
This maps we must have these
pages backs
HENRY gives INDY a look of surprise. Indy smirks.
ELSA
(to Donovan)
You're wasting your breath. He
won't tell us. And he doesn't
have to... it's perfectly obvious
where the pages are...
(looking at Indy)
... he's given them to Marcus
Brody.
HENRY now wears a pained expression.
HENRY
(to Indy)
Marcus?! You didn't drag poor
Marcus along, did you? He's not
up to the challenge.
DONOVAN
He sticks out like a sore thumb.
We'll find him.
INDY
The hell you will. He's got a
two-day head-start on you, which
is more than he needs.
(beat)
Brody's got friends in every town
and village from here to the Sudan.
He speaks a dozen languages, knows
every local custom. He'll blend
in. Disappear. You'll never see
him again. With any luck, he's
got the Grail already.
HENRY looks amazed and impressed.
The room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the windows. A HUGE
FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates
one wall.
The NAZI GUARDS have tied INDY and HENRY back-to-back in a pair of chairs.
ELSA and DONOVAN stand over them. VOGEL enters.
HENRY
Intolerable.
VOGEL
Doctor Schneider. Message from
Berlin. You must return immediately:
a rally at the Institute of Aryan
Culture.
ELSA
So?
VOGEL
Your presence on the platform is
requested... at the highest level.
ELSA
Thank you, Herr Oberst.
(to DONOVAN)
I will meet you at Iskenderun.
DONOVAN
Take this Diary to the Reich
Museum in Berlin. It will show
them our progress, ahead of
schedule. Without a map, I'm
afraid it's no better than a
souvenir.
He hands her the Grail Diary.
VOGEL
(to DONOVAN, meaning
Indy and Henry)
Let me kill them now.
CONTINUED:
ELSA
No. If we fail to recover the
pages from Brody, we'll need them
alive.
DONOVAN
(to VOGEL, with a
helpless shrug)
Always do what the doctor orders.
DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone,
ELSA turns to INDY.
ELSA
Don't look at me like thatwe
both wanted the Grail, I would
have done anything to get it.
You would have done the same.
INDY shakes his head "no."
INDY
I'm sorry you think so.
She runs her hand down the side of his face. INDY pulls away.
INDY and HENRY are still tied back-to-back of course. ELSA bends to speak
quietly into INDY's ear... which is near enough to Henry's ear.
ELSA
(whispers)
I can't forget... how wonderful
it was.
HENRY
Thank you. It was rather wonderful.
She smiles and kisses INDY passionately. HENRY glances back and looks rather
disappointed.
VOGEL appears to remind ELSA of her appointment.
VOGEL
Doctor Schneider! Your car is
waiting.
ELSA
(to INDY, after
finishing the kiss)
That's how Austrians say goodbye.
ELSA exits. VOGEL stays behind for another moment.
CONTINUED: (2)
VOGEL
And this is how we say goodbye in
Germany, Doctor Jones.
VOGEL punches INDY in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head
around.
HENRY
Ohh. . .
VOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear.
INDY
(to himself)
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way
better.
HENRY
So did I.
INDY
Let's try and get these ropes
loose. We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do!
HENRY
(confused)
You said he had two days' start.
That he would blend in. Disappear!
INDY
Are you kidding?I made that
up! You know Marcushe got
lost once in his own museum!
Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.
INDY
Can you try and reach into my
left jacket pocket?
HENRY is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. INDY squirms his
body around towards Henry's hand.
HENRY
What am I looking for?
INDY
My lucky charm.
HENRY
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
CONTINUED: (3)
INDY
Try and burn through the ropes.
HENRY's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.
HENRY
Very good.
HENRY yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the
floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to
burn. INDY doesn't know it yet.
HENRY
I ought to tell you something.
INDY
Don't get sentimental now Dad
save it 'til we get out of here.
HENRY
The floor's on fire! See?!
INDY
(turns and sees)
What???
HENRY
And the chair.
INDY
All right, movel Move!
Rock
your Chair.
Do what I do.
They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet.
INDY and HENRY are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back. Indy tries to
communicate with Henry, but each time he calls him, the men turn their heads in
opposite directions.
INDY
Dad!
HENRY
What?
INDY
Dad!
HENRY
What?
INDY
Dad!
Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.
HENRY
What?
INDY
Head for the fireplace!
HENRY
Oh.
BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE
FIREPLACEthe only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE.
CONTINUED:
INDY
I think I can get these ropes
off.
Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal
grill that operates a Secret Door.
INDY
Whoopsl
The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find
themselves in the:
where a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials,
switches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over a map plotting coordinates.
Their backs are turned to INDY and HENRY.
The floor begins to rotate again, and INDY and HENRY find themselves back in:
inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back.
HENRY
Our situation has not improved.
INDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY.
INDY
Listen Dad... I'm almost free.
INDY's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates to:
FOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the WOMAN are still hard at work with controls and
coordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and spots HENRY and INDY. She
screams.
WOMAN
Alarm!
Now the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY.
WOMAN
Schnel!!
TWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at INDY and HENRY
INDY and HENRY rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO. The carpet,
drapes and furniture are all ablaze.
HENRY
This is intolerable!
INDY
I'm out, Dad!
INDY finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie his father.
HENRY
Well done, boy!
All FOUR RADIOMEN now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and
begin to rotate through the Secret Door.
The RADIOMEN appear in the fireplace on the other sidebut there is NO SIGN
OF INDY AND HENRY.
The RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one
hand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY
escaped through these flames?
Not a chance.
They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN,
BEHIND the RADIOMEN.
One of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against
the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY
behind.
HENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the
next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS
rush forward to him.
INDY picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place,
sealing the NAZIS inside the burning room.
Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an order, and TWO
MORE NAZIS fall into step with him.
INDY grabs his whip, his leather sack and Henry's case from a table. He hands
the case to HENRY and they begin to run.
INDY
Come on Dad.
INDY and HENRY step into an empty room.
INDY
Dead end.
HENRY looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as INDY searches
frantically for an exit.
INDY
There's got to be a... a secret
door around. A passageway or
something.
INDY begins to run his hands over the wallsfrantic.
HENRY
I find that if I just sit down
and think...
HENRY sits on a chair which tips back, hitting the wall behind it. The floor at
INDY's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAYI
INDY grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through
the opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.
INDY
Dad!
HENRY
... the solution presents itself.
HENRY follows INDY down the staircase.
The stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous WATERY CAVERN
beneath the mountain on which the castle was built.
A full-scale Nazi BOAT DOCK has been built inside the cavern. We see
MOTORBOATS, GUNBOATS, SUPPLY BOATS, etc.
INDY
Great. More boats.
CONTINUED:
INDY boards one of the motorboats and STARTS THE MOTOR.
HENRY
Would you say this has been just
another typical day for you? Huh?
HENRY tosses his case at INDY who catches it and angrily throws it back to his
father.
INDY
(ironically)
Ooofl No! It's been better than
most.
INDY moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. HENRY looks confused.
INDY
Come on, Dad. Come onl
HENRY
What about the boat? We're not
going on the boat?
VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS enter the room and spot the spiral staircase
leading below. They quickly descend the stairs.
as VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS rush to the dock. Vogel sees that a motorboat
is missing. He orders the Nazi Soldiers into a boat.
VOGEL
Sie alle ins Boat. Schnell!
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a large box which suddenly BREAKS APART
as INDY, now on a motorbike with HENRY in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE
DOCK, hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the river.
VOGEL screams after INDY and HENRY as they drive off.
STRAIGHT CUT TO:
A Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing HENRY'S PICTURE to Nazi
Soldiers inside the terminal.
HENRY leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as INDY enters down the stairs
and taps Henry's shoulder.
They begin to walk toward the boarding gates.
HENRY
What did you get?
INDY
I don't know. The first available
flight out of Germany.
HENRY
Good.
INDY and HENRY show their papers to the Boarding Guards, then join the line of
passengers, which has already begun to move toward a:
MOORED ZEPPELIN
Ten stories tall and longer than two football fields: Flying in the grand tradition!
The Zeppelin is about to take off. INDY and HENRY make themselves comfortable
in one of the compartments.
INDY
Well, we made it.
HENRY looks over his newspaper at INDY.
HENRY
When we're airborne, with Germany
behind us, then I'll share that
sentiment.
INDY
Relax.
But INDY looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees:
VOGEL AND A GESTAPO AGENT
rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin.
VOGEL
Nicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!
INDY
sits back in his chair, looks to HENRY, now reading his newspaper.
A STEWARD enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of INDY and
HENRY, then continues down the aisle of passengers. Indy follows after the
Steward. He puts his arm around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk
up a flight of stairs.
VOGEL
now walks up the aisle. He approaches a MALE PASSENGER hidden behind a
newspaper. VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the newspaper and show the
Passenger the leaflet with Henry's photograph.
VOGEL
Haben sie disen Mann gesehen?
The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative. VOGEL shows the
picture to other Passengers.
FEMALE PASSENGER
Nein.
INDY (O.S.)
Fahrscheine, bitte.
MALE PASSENGER
Nein.
VOGEL turns to see:
INDY
WEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD.
MALE PASSENGER (O.S.)
Ich habe ihn night gesehen.
INDY
Tickets please.
The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English.
INDY
Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.
VOGEL
approaches HENRY, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, VOGEL uses his
walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face.
VOGEL
Guten Tag, Herr Jones.
Now INDY, still playing the role of Steward, asks VOGEL for his ticket.
INDY
Fahrscheine meine Herr.
VOGEL
Weg.
INDY
Tickets please.
HENRY looks confused.
VOGEL
(in German)
Was?
VOGEL glances up and recognizes INDYwho quickly punches Vogel in the face,
knocking him toward the window. In another quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT
THE WINDOW onto the tarmac below.
Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment.
INDY
(in German; with a
shrug)
No ticket.
Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face.
INDY and HENRY together again in their compartment.
HENRY
You know, sharing your adventures
is an interesting experience.
CONTINUED:
INDY
(meaning ELSA)
That's not all we shared. It's
disgraceful. You're old enough to
be her fa---er, her grandfather!
HENRY
Well, I'm as human as the next
man.
INDY
I was the next man.
HENRY
(laughs)
Ships that pass in the night...
HENRY opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it.
INDY
Do you remember the last time we
had a quiet drink? I had a milk
shake.
HENRY
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
INDY
We didn't talk. We never talked.
HENRY
And do I detect a rebuke?
INDY
A regret. It was just the two of
us, Dad. It was a lonely way to
grow up. For you, too. If you
had been an ordinary, average
father like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.
HENRY
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
INDY
When?
HENRY looks up from his Diary.
HENRY
Did I ever tell you to eat up?
Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do
your homework? No. I respected
your privacy and I taught you self-
reliance.
CONTINUED: (2)
INDY
What you taught me was that I was
less important to you than people
who had been dead for five hundred
years in another country. And I
learned it so well that we've
hardly spoken for twenty years.
HENRY
You left just when you were
becoming interesting.
INDY
Dad, how can you --?
HENRY
(interrupting)
Very well. I'm here now.
He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat.
HENRY
What do you want to talk about?
Hmmm?
INDY stutters uncomfortably as HENRY stares at him, waiting for a response.
INDY
(laughs)
Well... I can't think of anything.
HENRY
Then what are you complaining
about?
(laughs)
Look, we have work to do. When
we get to Alexandretta we will
face three challenges.
(he reads from the
Diary)
"First, the breath of God. Only
the penitent man will pass.
Second, the Word of God, only in
the footsteps of God will he
proceed. Third, the Path of God,
only in the leap from the lion's
head will he prove his worth. "
INDY
What does that mean?
HENRY
(laughs)
I don't know. We'll find out.
CONTINUED: (3)
Sunlight falls across the table from the window. INDY reaches for the drink. The
bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks.
We see INDY puzzled. Only for a moment.
INDY
They're turning around. They're
taking us back to Germany.
INDY and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin.
The Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed.
INDY and HENRY hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a PAIR OF
DOORWAYS framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin.
INDY
Well, I thought it would take
them a lot longer to figure out
the radio was dead. Come on,
Dad. Move!
Then INDY opens the doors. We see plenty of blue sky and white clouds. We also
see a small BIPLANE that is suspended from the Zeppelin by a HOOK & CRANE
DEVICE.
INDY
Come on, Dad. Come on!
INDY turns in his seat to give HENRY the "thumbs up." Henry smiles valiantly
and points down to the ground.
Then they both become aware of a STRANGE SOUND in the skies behind them.
Something between a ROAR and a WAIL.
TWO MESSERSCHMIDT FIGHTER BOMBERS
streak out of the clouds and race across the sky.
INDY AND HENRY
shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three times as fast as they
are) SCREAM past on either side.
INDY
Dad, you're gonna have to use the
machine gun. Get it ready.
HENRY turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed
expression.
INDY
(turning; pointing)
Eleven o'clock!
HENRY pulls out his watch.
INDY
Dadeleven o'clock!!
HENRY
What happens at eleven o'clock?
INDY uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a
time.
INDY
(frustrated)
Twelveeleventen. Eleven
o'clock. Fire!
HENRY doesand the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of his seat.
Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The speeding
Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING past in a blurmaking
wide turns miles away in the sky.
HENRY has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger
--RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!
RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!
The Messerschmidt banks to the left, but HENRY keeps it in his gun sight. Henry
swings the gun around, inadvertently CUTTING HIS OWN REAR STABILIZER IN
HALF.
INDY
Dad, are we hit?!
HENRY
More or less.
CONTINUED:
HENRY
Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
INDY looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father.
The plane begins to go down. INDY struggles to control its descent.
INDY
Hang on, Dads We're going in!
HENRY slumps down fearfully in his seat.
INDY has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel.
HENRY is a very nervous passenger.
INDY sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in the SIDE
MIRROR.
As the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around them,
narrowly missing the car.
HENRY
This is intolerable!
INDY
This could be close.
The FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel like a bullet
down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its belly SCRAPES against the
pavement and the sides of the tunnel.
Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless BALL OF FIRE
gaining on them; about to overtake them.
HENRY
Faster, boy --faster!
As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow.
HENRY
Well, they don't come any closer
than that!
HENRY looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING
out of the sky toward them.
BRODY has been left alone in the tank. HENRY climbs down into the tank and
taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him.
HENRY
Marcus!
BRODY
Arghhh! Oh!
CONTINUED:
They exchange an old University Club toast, swinging their arms at one another
and missing. Then HENRY flaps his arms and tugs his ears.
HENRY
"Genius of the Restoration"
Now BRODY tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head.
BRODY
"aid our own resuscitation!"
They exchange a handshake.
BRODY
Henryl What are you doing here?!
HENRY
It's a rescue, old boys Come on.
As HENRY starts to climb out of the tank, TWO NAZI SOLDIERS DROP DOWN from
above, their Lugers drawn. They are followed by VOGEL.
VOGEL
(re HENRY)
Search him.
The NAZI SOLDIERS point their guns at HENRY and BRODY.
VOGEL
(to HENRY)
What is in this book? That
miserable little Diary of yours!
VOGEL removes a glove and slaps HENRY with it.
VOGEL
Here's the map. The book is
useless, and yet you come all the
way back to Berlin to get it.
Why?
He slaps HENRY again.
VOGEL
What are you hiding?
Another slap.
VOGEL
What does the Diary tell you that
it doesn't tell us?!
VOGEL reaches out to slap HENRY yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping
him.
CONTINUED: (2)
HENRY
It tells me that goose-stepping
morons like yourself should try
reading books instead of burning
them.
DONOVAN appears at the turret cover.
DONOVAN
Colonel? Jones is getting away.
VOGEL
(indicating HENRY)
I think not, Herr Donovan.
VOGEL shouts to the Tank Driver.
VOGEL
Fire!
HENRY and BRODY hold their hands over their ears.
VOGEL shouts to the Gunner.
VOGEL
Der Kubelwagon sprengen!
The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, CATAPULTING THE
KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES.
The tank drives through the
resulting smoke an dust, then rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it
A NAZI SOLDIER pushes HENRY away from the window.
NAZI SOLDIER
Keine Bewegung.
He points his gun at HENRY and BRODY.
NAZI SOLDIER
Keine Bewegung.
The smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, BACKFIRES, blowing the breech out into
the face of the gunner, killing him and filling the tank with smoke.
BRODY, HENRY, VOGEL and the driver begin to choke.
HENRY and BRODY still held at gunpoint by the NAZI SOLDIER.
HENRY
Junior? Junior? Junior!
The NAZI SOLDIER swings his fist, knocking HENRY off his seat.
INDY appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by
VOGEL.
INDY
Dad!
He drops the gun down into the tank.
INDY
Dad! Dadl Get it!
VOGEL pulls INDY from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around
his neck.
THROUGH THE PERISCOPE
We SEE INDY and VOGEL struggling atop the tank. Indy lifts his feet, lunging
toward the periscope and pulling Vogel with him.
INDY's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope.
The NAZI SOLDIER looking through the periscope pulls away from it, smiles, then
turns back to it.
THROUGH THE PERISCOPE
INDY's face, still pressed against the lens.
VOGEL pulls INDY from the periscope.
The NAZI SOLDIER pulls away from the periscope again.
PERISCOPE SOLDIER
(laughing)
Diese Amerikane. Sie Kampfen wie
Weiber.
The periscope handle spins around and hits the PERISCOPE SOLDIER in the head.
He falls against the NAZI SOLDIER guarding HENRY and BRODY.
HENRY pushes the NAZI SOLDIER aside and grabs the gun. The PERISCOPE
SOLDIER struggles to take the gun from Henry.
The PERISCOPE SOLDIER holds HENRY from behind, forcing the gun toward him.
Henry reaches down and pulls a fountain pen from his coat pocket.
CONTINUED:
As the PERISCOPE SOLDIER pulls on HENRY's face, Henry lifts the fountain pen
and squirts ink into his face. The Soldier falls, his head smashing into the wall of
the tank. At the same time, Henry loses his grip on the gun which falls to the
floor.
BRODY
Henry, the pen
HENRY
What?
BRODY
But don't you see? The pen is
mightier than the sword.
HENRY fires the TANK GUN at the troop truck. SOLDIERS FLY INTO THE AIR.
The TROOP TRUCK flips over and EXPLODES.
BRODY looks at HENRY.
BRODY
Look what you didl
HENRY
It's war.
The NAZI SOLDIER knocks HENRY into a pile of boxes, then punches him in the
face.
As the SOLDIER raises the gun to HENRY's face, BRODY hits him over the head
with a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air.
The BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is
manipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; then the BULLET PINGS
AGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE MORE, this time passing THROUGH
THE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver
slumps forward, his body depressing the levers.
Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor.
INDY, SALLAH, HENRY AND BRODY creep forward to see:
THE TERRIFIED FACE OF A TURKISH SOLDIER
He's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under his breath.
What's going on here?
FULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE
THE TURK stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is very dark. GIANT
COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter.
ELSA AND DONOVAN
watch him from a safe distance.
THE TURK
is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't
notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED.
THE TURK stopsonly one step away from the beheaded soldier.
THE TURK
takes one more stepa fatal step, it turns out. We hear a ROARA WHOOSH
of airbut we SEE NOTHINGexcept THE TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND
BOUNCE across the ground.
INDY, HENRY, BRODY AND SALLAH
react to the sight.
ELSA AND DONOVAN
She looks at him, horrified.
DONOVAN
Helmut, another volunteer!
TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly...
The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and
his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns.
FULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE
INDY, HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers.
ELSA's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. she controls herself and continues
more coldly.
ELSA
(to INDY)
I never expected to see you again.
INDY
I'm like a bad penny. I always
turn up.
DONOVAN
Step back now, Doctor Schneider.
Give Doctor Jones some room. He's
going to recover the Grail for us.
CONTINUED:
INDY laughs.
DONOVAN
Impossible? What do you say,
Jones? Ready to go down in
history?
INDY
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
DONOVAN
(scornfully)
Nazis?!Is that the limit of
your vision?! The Nazis want to
write themselves into the Grail
legend and take on the world.
Well, they're welcome. But I want
the Grail itself. The cup that
gives everlasting life.
Hitler can have the world, but
he can't take it with him. I'm
going to be drinking my own health
when he's gone the way of the
Dodo.
(he draws his
pistol)
The Grail is mine, and you're
going to get it for me.
INDY
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
DONOVAN
You know something, Doctor Jones?...
you're absolutely right.
Then DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters
his side below the ribs.
INDY
Dad?!
HENRY
Junior. . .
ELSA
No!!
DONOVAN
( to ELSA)
Get back!
HENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to
his assistance.
CONTINUED: (2)
INDY spins toward DONOVAN with murder in his eyes.
DONOVAN points the gun at him:
DONOVAN
You can't save him when you're
dead.
INDY hesitates.
DONOVAN
The healing power of the Grail is
the only thing that can save your
father now. It's time to ask yourself
what you believe.
INDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of
him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent
reaction shotsELSASALLAHBRODYDONOVANregistering their
different emotions
INDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.
INDY
"The Breath of God... Only the
penitent man will pass. Only
the penitent man will pass. . . "
INDY takes a few steps forward.
INDY
"The penitent man will pass.
The penitent man..."
INDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died.
HENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry.
HENRY
(in a raspy voice)
"Only the penitent man will pass.
Only the penitent man will pass."
INDY
(quietly to himself)
The penitent man will pass. The
penitent... the penitent. The
penitent man...
HENRY
The penitent man. The penitent...
INDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs.
CONTINUED: (3)
INDY
The penitent man is humble before
God.
HENRY
Penitent. Penitent...
INDY
The penitent man is humble...
The cobwebs begin to move....
INDY
He kneels before God.
(to himself; suddenly)
Kneel!!
We hear the awful rush of airWHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of
kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face.
Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up.
From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR
SHARP TRIPLE PENDULUM.
INDY gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a
SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden
wheels turnthe mechanism controlling the spinning blades. INDY loops a rope
around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe.
INDY
I'm through!
ELSA AND DONOVAN
DONOVAN
We're through!
BRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved.
SALLAH
(to HENRY)
He's all right.
HENRY shakes his head.
HENRY
No.
BACK TO INDY
holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.
INDY
"The second challenge is the
Word of God. Only in the
footsteps of God will he proceed."
(to himself)
The Word of God... The Word of...
INDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is
engraved with a letter.
INDY
"Proceed in the footsteps of the
Word."
HENRY
lifts his head painfully.
HENRY
The Word of God...
BRODY
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
HENRY
The Name of God...
BACK TO INDY
as he studies the cobblestones before him.
INDY
The Name of God... Jehovahl
HENRY
still lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him.
HENRY
But in the Latin alphabet,
"Jehovah" begins with an "I."
BACK TO INDY
INDY
"J."
INDY takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and INDY falls up to his
hip -- his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.
HENRY
reacts.
HENRY
Oh dear!
BACK TO INDY
who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the v-rail Diary in his hand.
INDY
In Latin, "Jehovah" starts with
an "I." "I"...
Now we SEE each letter on the stones as INDY carefully walks forward.
DONOVAN and ELSA follow in his footsteps.
INDY
"E"... "H"... "O"... "V"... "A"...
INDY sighs with relief and steps forward to:
THE GREAT ABYSS
INDY stands in a small opening, just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze
through and beyond that a 100 foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across,
nothing but a rough, stony cliff wall.
BACK TO INDY
He can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the v-rail Diary.
INDY
"The path of flood. Only in the
leap from the lion's head will
he prove his worth."
INDY looks around and then he notices that inscribed into
the rock above his head is the head of a lion.
INDY
Impossiblel Nobody can jump this!
INDY looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it
is asking him to do.
BRODY
rushes forward and calls to INDY.
BRODY
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!!
Come quickly!
BACK TO INDY
INDY
(realizing)
It's... a leap of faith. Oh,
God.
HENRY
calls to his son.
HENRY
You must believe, boy. you must...
believe.
We see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. We
see that he is not going to make it. His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is
going to fall 100 feet to his death. And thenhe doesn't! He appears to be held
up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.
INDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.
Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks
100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with
lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet
are stepping.
It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage... in
perfect alignment with everything we see below.
When INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect
alignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and
he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.
Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.
A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a
hundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all
glitter and shine.
INDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that
a man is praying at the altarl
He has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL
KNIGHT.
CLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT
But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down.
Perhaps we see his eyes.
CONTINUED:
When the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly,
prepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at
Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too
much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt
to fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy
approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient
man.
KNIGHT
I knew you'd come, but my strength
has left me.
INDY
Who are you?
KNIGHT
The last of three brothers who
swore an oath to find the Grail
and to guard it.
INDY
That was seven hundred years ago.
KNIGHT
A long time to wait.
The GRAIL KNIGHT reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.
KNIGHT
You're strangely dressed...for a
knight.
INDY
I'm not exactly...a knight. What
do you mean?
KNIGHT
I was chosen because I was the
bravest and the most worthy. The
honor was mine until another came
to challenge me to single combat.
I pass it to you who vanquished me.
The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY.
INDY
(gulp)
Listen, I don't have time to
explain, but
At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display
of cups.
DONOVAN
Which one is it?
CONTINUED: (2)
KNIGHT
You must choose.
(beat)
But choose wisely. For as the
True Grail will bring you life
the False Grail will take it from
you.
DONOVAN
I'm not a historian. I have no
idea what it looks like. Which
one is it?
ELSA
Let me choose.
DONOVAN
Thank you, Doctor.
ELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors.
ELSA chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.
DONOVAN instantly takes it from her.
DONOVAN
Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than
I'd ever imagined. This certainly
is the cup of the King of Kings.
DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.
DONOVAN
Eternal life!
DONOVAN drinks from the goblet.
Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He
grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.
DONOVAN
What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . .
me. . .?
He starts to agefast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks.
Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes.
ELSA gasps and screams.
DONOVAN
What. . . is . . . happening. . . ?
His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits.
His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.
CONTINUED: (3)
INDY rushes forward and pushes DONOVAN away. As he falls he BODY BREAKS
INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL.
KNIGHT
He chose...poorly.
INDY studies the array of chalices.
ELSA
It would not be made out of gold.
INDY picks up another cupa simple earthenware jug.
INDY
That's the cup of a carpenter.
He and ELSA exchange a look.
INDY
There's only one way to find out.
INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses.
INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows.
A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we
see his wounds begin to heal.
KNIGHT
You have chosen wisely. But the
Grail cannot pass beyond the
Great Seal. That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.
CUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.
INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.
The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put
down their guns and kneel.
INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to
his lips.
HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.
HENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his
mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in
astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The
color returns to Henry's face.
HENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then
they shift to INDY's faceand they light up even more...
NAZI SOLDIERS
run forward. SALLAH points a rifle at them.
SALLAH
Drop your guns. Please.
The NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in
surrender.
INDY
(to HENRY)
Dad, come on. Get to your feet.
ELSA
steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with
possession of the Grail.
ELSA
We have got it. Come on.
ELSA steps onto the edge of the Great Seal.
INDY
Elsa! Elsa, don't movel
ELSA
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
INDY
Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The
Knight warned us not to take the
Grail from here.
A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from
the ceiling of the cavern. ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away
from her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT
OPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams.
ELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach.
As her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself
sliding forward across the slanted floor.
HENRY
Junior!
Junior!
With her free hand, ELSA is trying to get the Grail. INDY can't save her unless
she gives him her free hand. She has to choose.
INDY
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa.
Give me your other hand,
honey. I can't hold you.
CONTINUED:
ELSA
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.
INDY
Elsa! Give me your hand. Give
me your other hand!
ELSA just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has tipped the balance too
farINDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to
her death.
INDY
(horrified)
Elsa!!
Now the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart. HENRY grabs one of his
hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other.
HENRY
Junior, give me your other hand!
I can't hold on!!
INDY
I can get itI can almost
reach it, Dad.
INDY looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing
can ever be retrieved.
HENRY
Indiana. Indiana!!
INDY snaps his look up to his father. His father has never called him this before.
HENRY
(very calmly)
... let it go...
INDY abandons the Grail and grabs onto HENRY with both hands.
HENRY pulls him up to safety.
THE GRAIL KNIGHT
looks through the falling debris to INDY and HENRY. SALLAH and BRODY rush
from the crumbling Temple.
INDY
Dad. . .
The GRAIL KNIGHT raises his arm to HENRY.
CONTINUED:
INDY
Please, Dad...
INDY and HENRY down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles
down upon the spot where they stood. The GRAIL KNIGHT lowers his arm as he
watches them leave.
