                There was a time when the NFL was 

                  comprised of warriors.  Men who would 

                take the field in flimsy pads made of 

                rubber bands and wadded up newspaper.  

                Who would spend an hour after a game 

                in Green Bay, sifting through the 

                bloody snow looking for their teeth.

                As always, Casey, I m getting to a 

                point.  Today s players are spoiled.  

                Thad Humphries signed a contract.  All 

                of a sudden, he decides he doesn t 

                like the terms anymore, screw the 

                  contract, he doesn t show up for 

                  workouts!

                Not okay!  I know how invested Giants 

                fans are in keeping Humphries happy, 

                but you ve got to take the emotion out 

                of it and look at this logically.  A 

                contract is a contract.  You sign it?  

                You abide by it.  I don t care whether 

                it s a football contract or a car lease 

                or a child custody agreement --

  A bright, airy Connecticut home, modern architecturally but 
  homey in furnishing.  A staircase leads to a second floor 
  landing that overlooks the living room.  The place is tidy, 
  except for kids  coats sitting in a lump on the floor, and a 
  pile of loose Legos and Wii remotes left on the couch.  

  MEGAN -- pretty and put together in jeans and a T-shirt -- is

  Megan opens the door to reveal KELLI (blond and busty,

  toned legs.  A t-shirt stretched across her chest reads

  lots of product in his hair).  Nick s kids with Kelli, LITTLE

                This isn t about hitting home runs.  

                This is about pursuing some insane

                  apparently thinks no one at spring
