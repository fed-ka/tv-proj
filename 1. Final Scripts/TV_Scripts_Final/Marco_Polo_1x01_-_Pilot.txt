EPISODE 101


      FADE IN:

      EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - DAWN11

      SHAPES MOVING IN MIST. THE SOUNDS OF WAR: Metal on metal, 
      screams of the wounded, the dying, and, under it, the 
      foreboding low ominous drone of MONGOLIAN THROAT-SINGING...  

      SLOW MOTION: A SINGLE RIDER comes out of the fog, galloping 
      toward us. His helmet and face are covered in a mysterious 
      cowl and he wears the Asiatic style of lamellar armor, sword 
      at his belt, high boots made of felt and leather...

      SUDDENLY: TWO HORSES jump him from tall grass, causing his 
      mount to scream and rear. The Rider is thrown, lands hard. 
      Face down.

      TWO MOUNTED WARRIORS move in. One is armed with a Turko-
      Mongol sabre, the other grips a two-bladed halberd. Asiatic 
      faces, wind-burned and fierce; nomads of the Steppe. They 
      speak MONGOLIAN (subtitled):

                                  MONGOL WARRIOR #1
                          (Mongolian)
                    You take his horse.
                          (beat)
                    I ll take his head.

      One Mongol catches the riderless horse, the other dismounts, 
      all business. Still, a THIRD MONGOL WARRIOR rides up now, 
      cold-eyed. He dismounts, draws a mace.  

      The Fallen Rider rolls to his feet, his helmet somewhere in 
      the grass, his cowl down.

      The Mongols are about to attack when something freezes them.  
      Something utterly strange. The Fallen Rider is a white man. A 
      striking young European.

                                  MONGOL WARRIOR #2
                          (Mongolian)
                    What kind of ugly foreign devil...

                                  MONGOL WARRIOR #1
                          (Mongolian)
                    It is a round-eye... 

      The Third Mongol chambers his mace, is about to cave the 
      Westerner s head when --

                                  MARCO
                          (Fluent Mongolian)
                    By Tengri the Sky God, may your 
                    herds fatten well...




                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/122.
EPISODE 101

        CONTINUED:11

      Now all three balk, weapons drawn. MARCO POLO, 21, darts his 
      eyes toward the warrior on the horse, takes a cautious step 
      backward... scheming a way out...

                                  MARCO (CONT D)
                          (Mongolian)
                    Peace upon you and the Golden 
                    Horde. Bless Genghis Khan... and 
                    the Eternal Blue Sky...

      As he cautiously backs his way toward the high grass, he 
      becomes aware of a FOURTH MONGOL behind him --

                                  MARCO (CONT D)
                          (Italian)
                    Mother of God, I m a dead man.

      THE WARRIORS ATTACK!

      Marco ducks a sabre, rolls from the path of the double 
      halberd. It SLASHES at him again. He rolls again, alarmed. 
      Now a hook-scythe comes at him. 

      Marco slaps at his leather boot and draws, a Kerait dagger.

      The Third Mongol charges with a brutal five-blossom spin of a 
      scimitar. He cuts Marco s leather plates, but the young 
      foreigner  swallows  his opponent s momentum...

      SLOW MOTION: Marco spins 180 and impales the attacker with an 
      inverted dagger stab at the same time he fires a round kick, 
      disabling the Halberd Warrior. 

      The Fourth Mongol is stunned by this unlikely display of 
      Chinese martial arts. But not as stunned as Marco; competent 
      skill aside, the young man is sweat-drenched and unnerved as --

      MONGOLIAN SOLDIERS flood the valley. THROAT SINGING chills 
      his blood...

      MARCO SWEEPS A HANDFUL OF SAND at the Fourth Warrior s face. 
      He then grabs the stirrup of his escaping horse, makes a 
      desperate running mount...

      BEHIND HIM: That HORSEBACK MONGOL sets chase with Double Fire 
      Meteor Hammers, two spherical weights connected by a chain, 
      filled with fuel and lit afire.

      Marco gallops for his life across the Steppe. He rides well, 
      but not as well as the Flying Hammer Rider gaining on him at 
      breakneck speed...

      Marco lifts his small, Mongolian-style recurve bow. Draws an 
      arrow from his quiver, nocks it. Turning around in the saddle --
      completely around -- he raises the bow. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/123.

      ALL SOUND FADES. Only MARCO S PULSE -- in his face.

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    I believe it was God s will that I 
                    should survive, to one day return 
                    from my travels, so that men might 
                    know the things that are in the 
                    world...

      SLOW MOTION: Marco times his breath with the exact half-beat 
      in which all four of his horse s legs leave the ground -- and 
      he RELEASES A WHISTLING ARROW...

                                                                            CUT TO:



      EXT. VENICE, ITALY - DAY22

      FOUR YEARS EARLIER. 

      Renowned for her beauty, the  City of Water.  Magnificent 
        architecture frames the Grand Canal; a sultry breeze moves in 
      the curtains of a second story balcony.

      The sounds of boats, chimes, and impassioned fucking.

                                  DONA CATERINA (O.S.)
                    Marco, no... it s not right...



      INT./EXT. VENICE APARTMENT - BEDROOM/BALCONY - DAY33

      MOVE IN THROUGH THE BALCONY CURTAINS... ONTO AN ORNATE BED... 
      where 17 year-old Marco Polo makes hot Italian love to 33 
      year-old DONA CATERINA, a blonde Venetian.

                                  MARCO 
                    Sei molto bella... 

                                  DONA CATERINA
                          (edge of orgasm)
                    You must leave...

      But her long legs are wrapped tightly around him.

                                  MARCO
                    My soul is moist... but when I touch 
                    your breasts, I feel the sun... 
                          (kissing her areola)
                    Sea foam and roses... what is this 
                    scent? Profumo segreto?

      Her fingernails cat-claw into his back. And then -- SUDDEN 
      BANGING AT THE DOOR.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/124.

        CONTINUED:33

                                  DONA S HUSBAND (O.S.)
                    Caterina! 

      Young Marco rolls into his trousers. The naked Dona Caterina, 
      nipples erect, blonde tresses wild, ushers him out --

      ONTO THE BALCONY

      Where he gets dressed on the reckless descent, climbing down 
      the portico where incoming ships SOUND BELLS and A DOG BARKS 
      from the next balcony down...

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    Venezia, from the Latin  Veni 
                    Etiam,  that is, come back again, 
                    and again, for however often you 
                    come, you will always see new 
                    marvels, and new beauties...



44EXT. VENICE, ITALY - GRAND CANAL/CANAL ALLEYS - SUNSET 

      Marco sits on the end of a dock, eyes searching the vast 
      waters of St. Mark s Basin. He is writing in a small leather 
      bound journal...

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    But as a child of the canals I 
                    longed to see the marvels that lay 
                    beyond. The wonders explored by my 
                    father, far out at sea... 

      A GONDOLIER punts his batela dream-like on the lagoon, a 
      silhouette.

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    It had been sixteen years since 
                    Nicco Polo sailed on his great 
                      adventure... eight months before I 
                    was born.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Marco!

      Four teenaged Venetian Street Toughs come out from the maze 
      of alleys: The locals call boys like this CANAL RATS.

                                  CANAL RAT #1
                    Soldi, soldi -- Where s my coins? 

                                  MARCO
                          (writing)
                    I told you, Bernardino. Market day.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/125.

                                  CANAL RAT #2
                    Didn t the Baron s wife pay you 
                    today? For carrying her flowers up 
                    the stairs?

      Canal Rat #3 wraps his cape up around his head like a woman s 
      shawl and hugs himself in amorous mockery.

                                  CANAL RAT #3
                          (woman s voice)
                    Oh, Marco, Marco. It s not right. 
                    Fuck me deeper...

      Laughter echoes in the canals. 

                                  MARCO
                    Go fuck your sister.

                                  CANAL RAT #1
                          (grabbing Marco s journal)
                    Give me the book.

      Marco tries to tug the journal away from the juveniles.

                                  CANAL RAT #2
                    Let s see your stories. About the 
                    great traveler --

      He grabs again; a struggle ensues --

                                  CANAL RAT #3
                    He s no hero, Marco. He s a carpet 
                    peddler. A spice salesman. 

                                  MARCO
                    Va fanculo.

                                  CANAL RAT #1
                    Va fanculo tua Madre.

      A FIST smashes INTO HIS FACE as Marco hooks him; fight s on --
      spilling into the -- CANAL ALLEYS.

      Canal Rat #4 draws a street stiletto. Fists fly as Marco 
      takes a punch, throws three back, cuts another guy s eye. And 
      now Marco, too, has a short blade in his hand.

      The other boys spread out to let Marco and Canal Rat #4 pair 
      off with blades. The footwork is an unrefined form of 
      European fencing, blades extended. Lunge and parry; parry and 
      lunge.

                                  MARCO
                    You speak sin on my mother s grave, 
                    Strunzo, I ll cut you...



                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/126.

      One of the punks hisses out something and they scatter. Marco 
      watches them go, pockets his blade. A GROUP OF LA FORZA 
      (Medieval Police) march stiffly by the mouth of the alley...

      Marco picks up his journal, still seething. He spits.

                                  AUNT PATRIZIA (PRELAP)

      and head scarf, cuts up some fish on a butcher block.

                    All you do. All the time. Fight in 
                    the street, or look on the map...

      Marco sits at the end of a cot, studying parchment charts. 
      His finger traces the Silk Road route on one such flat-earth 
      map (along with India and Arabia, the map also recognizes the 
      Garden of Eden and sea monsters).

                    Dreaming about all these places.

      SOMEONE ENTERS unannounced. An OLD ITALIAN MAN with a Verona 
      cap and the thick wheeze of an asthmatic. Some kind of urgent 
      news brims at his lips...

                    It s Niccol . His ship has been

66INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - LATER 

      The Old Man and TWO OTHER RELATIVES lead young Marco into the 
      ancient church. Dimly-lit, stained glass. Empty.

      Marco proceeds alone -- slowly, steadily -- down the dark 
      aisle toward -- THE FRONT PEW.

      Where NICCOL  POLO kneels, an ornate silver cross in his 
      fist. The merchant is dark eyed and handsome, but years of 
      sea and desert travel have weathered his olive skin.

      He looks up to see his son for the very first time. An 
      emotional albeit awkward moment...

                                    NICCOL 
                    Marco. She gave you a fine name. 
                    Come here, Son...

      Marco enters the pew. Stands taller than his father. Much 
      leaner. Niccol  admires his stature, his striking face. Tears 
      well a bit... then he kisses the lad on each cheek.

                                    NICCOL  (CONT D)
                    When did she die?

                                  MARCO
                    I was six.

      Niccol  ruminates. 

                                    NICCOL 
                    For you...

      He lifts the fine silver cross with Latin inscription and 
      drapes the chain around his son s neck.

                    From Jerusalem. 

      Marco fairly beams; a gift from his father, great explorer 
      returned. Then Niccol  notes that the young man s curious 
      eyes are on --

      ANOTHER BEARDED MAN, standing off, speaking in hushed tones 
      to FATHER GREGORY, an ancient Catholic Priest.

                                    NICCOL  (CONT D)
                    Your Uncle Maffeo. Not as pretty as 
                    me, admit it. But he, too, is 
                    pleased to be home; he missed the 
                    red wine. And the fat women.

      Niccol  gestures for Marco to sit.

                    Indeed. Some men now call it 
                     China . And it is to China that I 
                    must return.

      Marco s smile holds, but his eyes betray.

                    I have no choice. It is a  mission

      He clasps a hand on Marco s shoulder, but it s not 
      comforting. Marco s mind is reeling...

                    Another sixteen years? 

      Uncle Maffeo loads crates of spices and fabrics. He gazes out 
      at the GATHERING CROWD, does a take. What he sees does not 
      please him. Nor does it upset him; he simply shakes his head, 
      resumes his business.

      Marco is coming up the dock, lugging a valise of his spare 
      belongings. He follows SIX FRANCISCAN PRIESTS onto the ship.

      Marco is sitting recklessly on the ship rail, wild ringlets 
      of hair in the wind. He is gazing dreamily out at a SCHOOL OF 
      DOLPHINS.

      Marco shouts back and points out the dolphins... and then 
      something even more remarkable -- a SEA RAINBOW on the 
      horizon. OCEAN SPRAY wets Marco s young face.

      Niccol  and Maffeo are trying to rig something; they need the 
      rope. Maffeo looks at the day-dreamer on the railing and 
      shakes his head.

      Marco finally scrambles over with the tangle of rope, sliding 
      on the slippery deck.

      legend gives him gooseflesh (and seems to unnerve the 
      priests).

      opposite direction; they are retreating. After a concerned 
      beat, Marco spurs his donkey on...

      another Priest drops to his knees, exhausted.

      The Polo caravan slowly approaches a village of adobe-like 
      huts and smoldering thatch. An ARMED GUIDE holds up a warning 
      hand... then cautiously proceeds into -- A RAZED VILLAGE.

      Where they ride along the margin of a high wall. Marco 
      realizes, as he passes through, that the wall has been 
      constructed of dead bodies. He covers his nose with his 
      threadbare scarf...

      The last Priest remaining crosses himself, but endures. 
      Niccol  and Maffeo dismount cautiously and approach a TINY 
      OLD WOMAN; she speaks in hoarse MANDARIN while the Armed

      Marco absorbs this... then he sees the last Priest doing 
      something odd. He is backing away from the scene and reciting 
      something in Latin about Hell and demons. He turns, begins to 
      run as --

      TWENTY FIVE MONGOL WARRIORS EXPLODE from a gully in a THUNDER 
      OF HOOFBEATS. In their heavy armor and furs, long mustaches, 
      they resemble a cross between mounted Samurai and demons from 
      the pits of Tartarus (the Priest s point, exactly).

      The Mongols surround the Polo party, bows raised and arrows 
      nocked. Niccol  discreetly moves himself in front of his son.  
      Maffeo reaches for his saddlebags, but the MONGOL CHIEFTAN 
      YELLS at him in MONGOLIAN. Niccol  speaks back, calmly. 
      Firmly.

                                    NICCOL 
                          (Mongolian; subitled)
                    We are guests of Kublai Khan, the 
                    Great Lord of Lord s.

      Marco observes as Uncle Maffeo slowly produces a gold-plated 
      wooden passport so all can see...

      The Chieftan rides forward, angles a look on it. The golden 
      tablet bears Mongolian script and Chinese letters. 

      Tense beat. As the Chieftan confers with a LIEUTENANT, 
      Niccol  and Maffeo make cautious eye contact. Marco relaxes a 
      bit, intrigued by the Mongols.

      SUDDENLY: At a one word command by the Chieftan, the Mongols 
      FIRE THEIR ARROWS. They begin to kill everyone. The armed 
      guide next to Marco crumples with an arrow through his 
      throat; another is brain-pierced, falls off his mule. An epic 
      arrow launch takes down the running Priest.

      The Mongols slaughter everyone... except the three Polo s.

                    had no permission to come this 
                    close to the City of the Khan.

      With that, he turns his horse and begins to lead the 
      entourage out of the razed village.

      EXT. CAMBULAC (CITY OF THE KHAN) - DAYS LATER - DAY1111

      The Mongol military escorts leads the Polo s toward a 
        magnificent, multi-cultural Utopia (precursor to today s 
      Forbidden City).

      As they approach one the city s three Western Gates, Marco 
      and the elder Polo s are swarmed by a MASS OF VENDORS and 
      LAUGHING CHILDREN. A shouting swell of CHINESE, MONGOLS, 
      TIBETANS, and PERSIANS...

      THREE BOY HORSEMEN gallop past; painted PROSTITUTES gaze up 
      at Marco; A DRUNKEN UIGHUR hurls insults at the Europeans. A 
      MONGOL SOLDIER strikes the offender brutally to the grass 
      with the butt-end of a lance.

      And this is just the village outside the gate. Passing 
      through a GARRISON OF MONGOLIAN AND CHINESE SOLDIERS, the 
      Polo s make a dizzying entry --

      THROUGH THE WESTERN GATE -- INTO THE IMPERIAL CITY.

      Where a CLOCK BELL is ringing a deafening announcement of the 
      arrival. Marco clings to the reins, enthralled, as they are 
      escorted through a SEA OF HUMANITY to -- 



      INT. IMPERIAL PALACE - FRONT HALL - DAY1212

      The Polo s are led down an ornate hallway, past gilded 
      chambers where --

      SILK-ROBED SERVANTS and MILITARY OFFICIALS look on in 
      silence. They bow in unison as the exhausted foreigners are 
      led up to a robed EUNUCH. He barks at them in fierce, high-
      pitched MANDARIN.

      The Polo s are handed white slippers which they obediently 
      put on. Now, they are each handed a small, ornate vessel.

                    Eyes down, down...

      Uncle Maffeo looks particularly unnerved.

      INT. IMPERIAL PALACE - THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER1313

      Niccol , Maffeo, and Marco crawl on their hands and knees, 
      heads bowed, through a royal gantlet of WARRIOR NOBLES,  
      BARONS, ruby-lipped CONCUBINES, and the FOUR EMPRESSES.

      Niccol  and Maffeo prostrate themselves, touch their heads to 
      the carpet three times. Marco follows suit. On his third bow, 
      he covertly lifts his eyes, steals a glance upward.

      IN SHADOW AND CANDLE LIGHT: An imposing figure sits on his 
      throne, a TAMED LION near his feet. KUBLAI KHAN dressed in 
      gold and silk. His face is distinctly Mongol; fierce eyes, 
      thick jowls, and cheek bones that could slice a plum. His 
      beard hangs in a sage-like wisp, his long hair braided into 
      loops behind each ear. HIS EYES contain a mischievous gleam, 
      but also something barbaric. Dangerous.

      At a signal, Niccol  hands a leather-wrapped European vessel 
      to an OFFICER who hands it to A BARON who, in turn, brings it 
      up to --  KUBLAI KHAN.

      Who does not speak. He makes a sharp, guttural intake of 
      breath, one that is echoed by his Baron, like two cats 
      coughing. Strange as it is, they are communicating with 
      breathing sounds -- the Ural-Altaic language only a true 
      Mongol can understand. Finally, Kublai Khan speaks -- in 
      impressive English.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN
                    The Latins. Yes. I remember. But 
                    where are the Christian priests you 
                    were to bring?

                                    NICCOL 
                    Lord Kublai... please accept our 
                    remorse. Our priests... they could 
                    not bear the rigors of the journey. 
                    But we did bring you holy oil from --

                                  KUBLAI KHAN
                    -- your men of God retreat, but 
                    this boy advances? This says very

                    Holy oil. A letter from the Pontiff 
                    who wishes to spread Christianity 
                      throughout my lands. Is this not 
                    the same Pope who has called me the 
                    spawn of Satan?

      The elder Polo s don t flinch.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN (CONT D)
                    I will say this and you will listen: 
                    Buddhism is welcome in my kingdom. As 
                    is Taoism, Confucianism, Islam, and 
                    the Eternal Blue Sky of my grandfather 
                    Genghis Khan -- who was descended from 
                    a wolf. 

      Marco reacts, equal parts frightened and intrigued. His 
      father and uncle appear terrified. The Great Khan cradles the 
      vessel of holy oil, examining it in the light.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN (CONT D)
                    I revere them all. The Mongols 
                    don t care, you see, which God is 
                      worshipped in their lands. As long 
                    as all are faithful to the Great 
                    Khan and obey his laws, they can do 
                    whatever they please with their 
                    souls.

      Now the Khan gestures and the Baron signals for the 
      foreigners to rise and face His August Personage.

      Marco feels the critical eyes of a handsome young Prince in 
      luxurious fox and sable, long Chinese sword at his belt. This 
      is JINGIM, the Junior Khan -- eldest son of Kublai.

      The other wives smile, too, and so do the concubines (the 
      lesser ones covering their mouths with silk napkins). A swell 
      of approving giggles travels through the female retinue. 

      One girl in particular lowers her painted fan, revealing 
      stunning eyes. KOKACHIN, early 20s, otherworldly beautiful, 
      peers with curiosity. At her shoulder, a giant of a EUNUCH 
      GUARD hovers like a stone arhat.

      Marco is looking to his father, still stunned while Kublai 
      confers privately with his Advisors.

      Niccol  turns to his son, stares at him, uncomfortable. 
      Quickly, he embraces him, kisses him on each cheek.  

                                  MARCO

      Marco grips his father s arm, tightly. Niccol  takes his 
      son s hand... and slowly removes it from his arm. 

      Now, Marco finds himself physically separated from his father 
      as an OFFICIAL CEREMONY of ARMED ATTENDANTS surrounds him. 
      MONGOLIAN THROAT-SINGING is starting up; KETTLE DRUMS 
      beginning to boom.

      His eyes follow as Ahmad and an official retinue lead the 
      merchants down a long hall. Marco tries to break free, tries 
      to follow, but he s hemmed in. 

                                  COURT EUNUCH

                      loyalty...

      Fuck that. Marco explodes through the official gathering. He 
      doesn t just run. He rampages, trying to get out. 

      FROM HIS THRONE -- The Khan just watches, inscrutable. He 
      makes a simple breath sound and SOLDIERS GO AFTER the 
      runaway.



      EXT. CAMBULAC - MARKET PLACE - MOMENTS LATER1414

      Marco runs roughshod through market stalls and hanging ducks, 
      baskets of pears spilling over. Like a canal rat back in 
      Venice, he darts up alleys, navigates walls...

      the caravan taking leave.

      INT. HALL OF PURIFICATION - DAY1515

      OUT OF MIST, Marco emerges naked, scrubbed of lice. 
        Disoriented. The waiting Eunuch hands him some folded 
      clothes. Simple leather and felt.

      9 YEAR-OLD MONGOL BOYS ride circles around the foreigner, 
      knock him off his horse with herding sticks.

      A CALLIGRAPHY BRUSH makes a delicate stroke in the hand of an

      by the deep abrasion on his arm from a horse fall.

      A small temple-like structure. Marco sits on a bamboo mat 
      across from a joyous, grinning OLD SCHOLAR. There is still

      The Scholar gives a toothless grin of Buddhist joy.

                                  OLD SCHOLAR
                    Only the Khan knows. 

      Flustered, Marco looks toward a lute-shaped window through 
      which he can see the sun play on distant mountains of purple 
      mist. Is his father out there somewhere?

      A BIG SHADOW fills the doorway. A LARGE MONGOL GUARD holding 
      a bladed halberd. He summons.



      EXT. CAMBULAC - TRAINING GROUNDS - SHORT TIME LATER2020

      Two Mongol Guards walk Marco across a field, point him in the 
      direction of a lone figure, just sitting out there in the 
      grass. Hesitantly, Marco approaches the man from behind.

      Judging by his saffron robes, he must be a monk. But his hair 
      is worn in a long topknot, the sign of a Taoist. HUNDRED 
      EYES, Minister of Martial Arts, is much younger than the 
      other scholars. 

      After a long moment of what seems to be profound meditation, 
      the monk speaks.

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                    May I ask... which hand does a 
                    European wipe his ass with? The 
                    left or the right?

      Hundred Eyes bites into a pear as he turns toward Marco. But 
      he doesn t look directly at him. He is blind. 

                                  MARCO
                    I was told that you are to teach me 
                    Chinese boxing. What would the hand 
                    that wipes my ass have to do with 
                    such a discipline?

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                      Absolutely nothing. I just never 
                    met a Latin before. I am curious.

      Hundred Eyes rises, takes another bite of the pear. 

                                  MARCO
                    You are blind...

                    No matter. I can still hear the 
                    sound of one hand clapping. 

                                  MARCO 
                    Would that be the same hand that 
                    wipes your ass?

      Hundred Eyes goes hard-faced for a moment. Then he breaks a 
      dangerous smile, begins to laugh. Marco knits his brow; this 
      guy doesn t seem like a monk at all.

      SUDDENLY: Hundred Eyes tosses the pear core into the air.

      SLOW MOTION: He whirls, drawing a Chinese broad sword. HE 
      SLICES THE PEAR CORE in half -- not once, not twice, he dices 
      it before the pulp lands like descending blossoms.

      Marco stares, incredulous, a bit unnerved. The blind monk 
      sheathes his sword, rests his hand casually on the hilt.

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                    You have been conscripted into the 
                    court of Kublai Khan. For what, I 
                    do not know. Me? I am kept here to 
                    train the Khan s sons. His nobles.

                    We are all prisoners here. 
                    Prisoners and privileged guests.

      He turns his back on Marco, keeps turning, saffron robes 
      whirling -- and sweeps Marco on his ass.

                                  MARCO
                    Putana...

                    No roots.

      Marco rolls to his feet, dusts off.

                    You have spirit, Latin. Of the Yin 
                    and the Yang... you have an 
                    abundance of Yang. But without Yin, 
                    Yang dies on the battlefield. Do 
                    you see what I did to that pear? 

      Marco doesn t respond.

                                    HUNDRED EYES (CONT D)
                    That s your cock... in the first

                    is I who will be killed. Do you 
                    hear me?

      Marco doesn t reply. Hundred Eyes cocks his head.

                    I hear you.

      Hundred Eyes barely moves, sweeps Marco on his ass again. 
      Even harder.



      INT. IMPERIAL PALACE - HALL OF MILITARY AFFAIRS - DAY2121

      Inside one of the six halls of the Khanate, a war assembly is 
      being held. The Mongols call this a Kurlitai. But in Kublai s 
      progressive palace it resembles more of an internal meeting 
      of the Superpower: The Great Khan sits on a raised pavilion, 
      the embodiment of opulence and power, looking down over his 
      TWENTY FIVE MAN CABINET:

        Elaborately-dressed Mongols, Chinese, and Muslim Turks -- an 
      administration chosen for both its political and religious 
      balance. In this moment of deep stillness the Khan s TAOIST 
      ADVISOR is casting the I-Ching, a complex system of 
      divination.

      THE KHAN S EYES observe as the Taoist sets down fifty yarrow 
      stalks into 64 six-line patterns. The traditional Mongols 
      sitting nearby all frown, puzzled by Kublai s evolving 
      interest in these cultured Chinese ways.

                    The movement of Heaven is most

      Kublai looks over at YUSUF, a white-bearded Saracen who walks 
      with a limp, his body twisted wrong under his Deel robes. He 
      lives with pain.

                    Prince Jingim is wise. North China 
                    already adores Lord Kublai. Let 
                    South China stay inside their

                    cow that we draw milk from... 
                    rather than slaughtering the cow 
                    and receiving no milk.

                    The walled city of Xiangyang guards 
                    the Yangtze River. The Yangtze is

                    If Xiangyang falls, the Song

                    before the Khan Empire. 

      Ahmad bows elegantly to Kublai as the Great Khan digests 
      this, showing no emotion...

      An imposing Mongol now makes a breath sound that means he 
      wishes to speak. When all eyes go to him and he rises, it is 
      as if beholding the ghost of Genghis Khan. ARIQ BOKE wears a 
      strip of hair down the middle of his head which is shaved 
      bald on either side, the back hair long and braided.

                    those of the Chinese laws. There 
                    are some in Karakorum who fear that

                    We just want to know: Does Our

      Kublai rises to his full height and overweight girth, a bit 
      stiff in the joints, a bit tentative on sore feet. He holds 
      out a hand and an ATTENDANT presents to him a long ceremonial

      carpet unrolls down the length of the floor between the 
      seated Mongols and Cabinet, Kublai stands over the great silk 
      map of the massive Khan empire.

                    China. They are amassing as I

      is palpable, but then --

                    north and into battle with my

      A low tone rises up from where the Mongols sit. A vibrating 
      sound from the throat. Blood is in the air...

      INT. XIANGYANG - JIA SIDAO S QUARTERS - DAY2323

      CHANCELLOR JIA SIDAO, 47, stares with tranquil eyes. The eyes 
      of a warrior-philosopher-sociopath.

                                  JIA SIDAO 
                    My General is great. Do you see?
                    He pretends inferiority to 
                    encourage his opponent s advance...

      HE PEERS DOWNWARD ON: A battle between a praying mantis and a 
      cricket, fighting on a table  arena  between Jia Sidao and 
      his GENERAL RED BROW. The two men bet with paper currency.

      The Chancellor now teases a small bamboo stick at the 
      cricket, makes it turn toward the mantis... 

                                  RED BROW
                    Kublai Khan s men continue to

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    How is our Emperor?

                                  RED BROW

                    How much longer I mean.

      Red Brow glances toward the GUARDED DOORS of the Imperial 
      Chambers where candles burn in vigil.

                    It will be a sad day, but much more 
                    efficient once he s gone. No more 
                    mixed messages from an Old King to 
                    the people. I will give all orders 
                    and all orders will be followed.

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    And that goes for the Emperor s 
                    favorite royal concubine. 

      Red Brow glances back at the Imperial doors again.

                    Where is your sister?

                    Improving diplomatic relations with 
                    the Governor of Hangchow.

      The Chancellor smiles, leans forward, watching the mantis 
      grab the cricket. A little boy s head appears, head shaven 
      but for a long plaited queue. When he tries to grab a 
      cricket, the Chancellor grabs his arm, fiercely. Then he 
      loosens the grip, checks his temper. He smiles at little ZHAO 
      XIAN and pats the top of his head. The boy runs off...

      MEI LIN rides atop the breathless GOVERNOR OF HANGCHOW. Naked --

      Then she stops, suddenly, like a skilled mime. With his other

      long and loose. He almost passes out over her legendary 
      beauty... and then she puts the jade pin to his throat. His

                    There is no honor in this for me...

      Hundred Eyes walks around him in a methodical circle. Again, 
      he attempts to sweep. But Marco has had it; he decides to 
      evade, and does.

      But Hundred Eyes is not where Marco expected... and the Monk 
      kicks him hard in the ass.

      Marco spins and lunges with Italian temper. Hundred Eyes 
      evades with an almost imperceptible movement. 

      Marco goes at him, swings viciously. Can t touch him.

                    Nor did you ask to be left here... 
                    by a man who would trade his own 
                    son like two pounds of spice...

      Marco goes  canal rat,  advancing with knife-fight footwork, 
      gives it all he s got. Still can t touch him.

      Marco lunges, swings, misses the ghost again.

                    For the opportunity to open trade 
                    routes to the West.

      Marco fakes a lunge, changes his angle and attacks with a 
      bitter hook. Misses cleanly, can t believe it.

                    Let him go, Latin. 

      The thought fills Marco with one last burst of rage. He 
      lunges, swings, feels himself giving out... and finally goes 
      down, exhausted in the grass. 

                                    HUNDRED EYES (CONT D)
                    Get up. If you wish to survive 
                    here... get up at once.

      Marco HEARS HOOFBEATS. He lifts his head, breathing like an 
      angry, unbroken colt. He gets to his feet just as --

      TWO MONGOL GUARDS ride up on horseback with official bearing 
      and stare down at Marco.

                    The foreigner has been summoned. To 
                    the Imperial Palace.

      Marco reacts. Hundred Eyes does not.



      INT. IMPERIAL PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT2727

      Kublai sits on his throne, A KAZAKH PETITIONER kneeling 
      before him, the last one of the day. At a single word in 
      MONGOLIAN, the Kazakh is led down the aisle, passing --

      Marco as he s escorted in. Marco notes that the Kazakh is 
        weeping/babbling like a child as he s led out. Marco drops to 
      all fours, keeps his face down. Until the Khan invites him to 
      rise. The anguished cries of the Petitioner linger outside...

                    the same kind. If he is unable to 
                    pay this fine, his children must be 
                    taken instead of the horses, and if 
                    he has no children, he himself

                          (beat)
                    That man has no children.

      Marco absorbs this; can still hear the desperate begging 
      fade. But for TWO GUARDS at the door, Marco and the Khan are 
      alone now.

                    of Kashgar. There are raiders in

      Marco considers the assignment, nods tentatively. The Guards 
      react to the informal nod. Marco checks it, bows properly.

      Finally, the Khan gestures and Marco is escorted back down 
      the long carpet.

                      sounded...

      Marco is studying the GREAT CLOCK, but then -- at the SOUND 
      OF HOOFBEATS ON PAVEMENT -- he draws back quickly to allow 
      the passage of a mounted detachment: Fierce MONGOL GUARDS on 
      spirited horses.

      follows his first view ever of FIREWORKS down the lane lit by 
      paper lanterns when --

      A TWELVE FOOT TALL CHINESE WOMAN in white painted face walks 
      toward him, a colorful fan in each hand. She is on the 
      shoulders of a STILT WALKER who strides through the JOVIAL 
      CROWD followed by ANOTHER. 

      Behind this folk dance, a PLATE SPINNER wheels about and a 
      MANCHURIAN DWARF juggles.

      As Marco drifts through the crowd, his eye is caught by 
      something else, appearing for a moment between passerby. It 
      is Kokachin, the stunning young royal he glimpsed in the 
      Khan s throne room. 

      SLOW MOTION: As she smiles, delighted with the show, Marco 
      watches her. 

      All around Marco, dwarves juggle, stilt-walkers do fan 
      tricks, and  fire trees  light the sky... but it is the 
      beauty of this young girl that has the Venetian utterly 
      hypnotized.

      him staring at her. Their eyes meet for a powerful, magnetic 
      second. Alchemy, indeed...

      Marco drifts through the street crowd, trying to find the

      tall legs and spots her again.

      She walks, her hair falling past her hips. Marco pursues. She 
      glances over her shoulder. And then someone blocks his path.

      EXT. CAMBULAC - NEXT MORNING3434

      In the shadow of the Imperial Palace, Marco accompanies 
      SANGA, the tax collector, through the thriving marketplace, 
      the collections wagon ahead. Sanga is round, jolly --

                    tribute -- they end up peddling 
                    outside the wall. No market, no

      The Jurchen Woman peers suspiciously at Marco, resumes work. 
      As Marco and Sanga head to the collection wagon, the 
      persistent group of children cling to the Latin, laughing at 
      his every move.

      The Chancellor Jia Sidao is sitting in a small, royal chamber 
      full of porcelain. He admires the glazing on a rice bowl, 
      turning it over in his hands.

      In an enormous candle-lit bed of silk and oils, three of the 
      Khan s four wives lay with EXOTIC GIRLS from Kungurat. It is 
      an hypnotic orgy on a grand scale glimpsed only in soft

       Turning Dragon ), lips touching necks, tongues lightly 
      teasing ( Fluttering Phoenix ), Persian love beads and

      Chabi pats the bed. Marco sits, gazing up at the carved

      Drawn to the flesh, young loins aching. The walls have eyes

      THE MONGOLS NOW SPLIT INTO THREE, the center unit making an 
      abrupt turn, UNLEASHING ARROWS. They meet the stunned charge 
      of Song Rebels. Byaamba gallops past Jingim, retching a war 
      cry from his belly.

      On foot now, and drawing his sabre, Jingim fights with the 
        highly-cultivated skill and elegance of a scholar with a 
      paint brush -- noble poetry in motion... while around him, 
      his men, like half-brother Byaamba, fight more like mace-

      Jingim impales a Rebel, spins and slices two more in one 
      move. He ducks a swing of a pudao and fires a dance-like 
      spinning back kick that crushes an ATTACKER S throat.

      The Chancellor Jia Sidao knocks on a red lacquered door in 
      the Imperial Quarters. Mei Lin answers, wrapping her robe.

      For a second she appears to appreciate the gesture. But

      This last nuance burns the Chancellor. He is about to reply 
      when the girl child, LING LING, appears at her mother s hip. 
      A pampered Imperial Daughter of a concubine. The Chancellor

      INT. HALL OF FRAGRANCE - BATHE - DAY5959

      Kokachin is in her bath, pampered by THREE FEMALE ATTENDANTS. 
      One does her feet, one treats her ears with oils, the third 
      does her hands. 

      Za Bing enters, speaking Mandarin, and the Attendants leave.  
      Alone with the girl, Za Bing hands her some folded parchment. 
      She stares at it, does not take it.

                                  KOKACHIN
                      A proposal? The Prince of Bukhara?

                                  ZA BING
                    No. Someone left it on the garden 
                    wall.

      Curious, she takes it, unfolds it. She studies the 
        calligraphy, barely dry.

                                  KOKACHIN
                    The calligraphy is terrible. I 
                    can t even read it.

      She shoves it back at him. Za Bing reads it in the light.

                                  ZA BING
                     Sublime Beauty has a truth all 
                    it s own. 

      Kokachin isn t sure how to react, but Za Bing fairly swoons. 
      He needs to open his bamboo fan and cool himself.

      Kokachin takes the parchment again and looks at it.



      EXT. HALL OF FRAGRANCE - NIGHT6060

      Marco rides his horse down the paved streets, seems to be 
      checking the GUARDS rotation again. He looks up at the Great 
      Clock as he slows his pace near -- THE HALL OF FRAGRANCE. 

      Which is lit dimly by the soft flicker of candles.

      MARCO S POV: Kokachin s silhouette in the upstairs quarters. 
      TWO ATTENDANTS are undressing (or perhaps dressing) her.

      MARCO tries to look away. He can feel the danger...

                    It s getting dangerously close to

                                  MARCO 
                    The Minister of Horses has 
                      instructed that I ride in the dark 
                    each night. So that Ba-Tu and I  
                    gain trust of each other.

                                  ZA BING
                    You look most regal in the saddle.

                    myself forced to uphold my 
                    pledge...

      When Marco just sits there for a moment, Za Bing unsheathes 
      his blade with the sound of singing steel.

                                  ZA BING (CONT D)

                    member of the elite vanguard to

      Marco kicks Ba-Tu s flanks and trots away...

      TROTTING ACROSS CAMBULAC, he becomes aware of HOOFBEATS 
      behind him. Quickening. Gaining. Overtaking him, and nearly 
      knocking him from his saddle, as a NIGHT RIDER gallops past, 
      making a strange whistle. Marco s horse bolts, chasing --

                                  MARCO
                    Ba-Tu!

      THE HORSE RACE is on! Down the paved path toward the south 
      gate. The hooded rider leads Marco out the gate.



      EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - NIGHT6161

      Out on the moonlit grasslands, the Night Rider finally reins 
      to a stop, spins his frothing horse in a circle around Marco 
      who tries to recover from the full-out stampede.

      He drops his hood and reveals himself. No he. It is Kokachin.

                                  KOKACHIN
                    You have a fast horse. But you need

                    I did not expect --

                    like a Mongol? All Mongol women are 
                    born to the horse and the bow.

      Marco digests this, makes a study of her in the saddle.

                    There are some nights when Za Bing 
                    looks the other way... so that I 
                    might remember what it feels like 
                    to ride the Steppe. Four nights 
                    ago... I killed a deer.

      She says this with the pride of a huntress.

                                  MARCO
                    Why did you lead me out here?

      She studies him, intrigued. The CLOCK BELL RINGS once. He 
      comes closer.

                    I saw how your father left you. It 
                    made me remember.

      Marco moves closer still...

      his saddle bags and stows them in the ruins of a rammed-earth

      Kokachin, hooded again, turns the corner on her horse. She 
      dismounts, handing the reins to Za Bing. He is sweat-soaked 
      with worry and not pleased with his charge.

                    Good. Because you are riding to 
                    Karakorum with my son Jingim today.  
                    Now.

                                  MARCO

      Kublai nods, barely. Sends him out.



      EXT. CAMBULAC - LATER6666

      Jingim rides at the head of a SMALL SCOUTING PARTY. When he 
      sees Marco approaching on horseback, gerfalcon on his wrist, 
      he does not bristle. Jingim is too composed for that.

                                  JINGIM
                      I understand that you are to join 
                    my caravan, Latin.

                                  MARCO
                    If it pleases the prince.

      Clearly it does not. Marco offers a look that says:  Fuck 
      you, too. 

                                  JINGIM
                    You will ride at the rear of my 
                    march. With the astrologers and the 
                    camel skinners.

      Byaamba, that tough son of a Khan concubine, rides up on 
      Marco s other side.

                                    BYAAMBA

      Marco gives Byaamba a testy look, but controls his temper; 
      maybe Hundred Eyes s teachings are taking root. He turns his 
      mount and heads to the back.

      Jingim is now staring at Byaamba.

                                  JINGIM
                    You, too.

      Byaamba pretends he didn t hear his half-brother, rides 
      toward the back by his own accord... with Marco Polo, the 
      Venetian.



      EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - NORTH OF CAMBULAC - DAY6767

      Jingim s procession rides north at a steady trot. When they 
      reach a stream, Jingim orders all to water their mounts. 
      Marco rides his way forward, comes alongside the Prince.

                                  MARCO
                    How far to Karakorum?

                    Another day.

      Jingim studies Marco as the foreigner lets Ba-Tu drink.

      Marco digests this as Jingim leads his horse away. Looking 
      out, Marco spots a song bird in the sky. Inspired in the 
      moment -- perhaps wanting to show his skills in front of 
      Jingim -- he turns his horse and prepares his gerfalcon.  
      Jingim watches him. So does Byaamba.

      Marco casts the hunting hawk skyward. Impressive. But it 
      doesn t go after the bird. It flies away. Home.

      LAUGHTER from the streamside Mongols. Jingim smiles.

                                    BYAAMBA
                    Your hawk went home. Don t worry. 
                    We will hunt for you. 

      Jingim reins his horse in a tight circle, shouts an order to 
      press on.

      Marco s hawk-glove looks naked, his pride wounded. But he 
      recovers and catches up with the procession.



      EXT. KARAKORUM - DAYS LATER6868

      A world away from the opulence of Cambulac, this is the old 
      capitol of the nomads. Pastoral. Hundreds of yurts. Adobe-
      like walls and huge stone turtles at the gate.

      TRADITIONAL MONGOLS go about their business... then react to 
      approaching HOOFBEATS. From the walls, GUARDS shout  Khagan 
      Kublai.  A primitive horn is sounded...

      POV: Jingim leads the procession in, the flags of the House 
      of Kublai (sun and moon insignia) held high.

      REVERSE: Ariq emerges from his dwelling, eating borts. The 
      Khan s powerfully-built younger brother watches his ROYAL 
      GUARD hem in and escort the Prince.

      When Jingim dismounts, TWO GUARDS take his horse...

                                  ARIQ
                    My nephew. I see you still ride the 
                    horse I gave you on the White Moon. 
                    Your eighteenth year, yes?

                                  JINGIM
                    Uncle...

      Jingim approaches. Ariq offers his arms; Jingim grips them 
      just below the elbows. Marco observes the custom as he 
      dismounts, his curious eyes taking in the tribal city...





                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1266.

                    I m honored that my older brother has 
                    sent you and not some messenger. We 
                    will kill a sheep and drink kumis. 
                    Come.

      As Jingim and a small entourage follow Ariq toward the huge 
      Royal Yurt at center, Marco follows...

      But at the door Jingim stops, gives him a look. The Prince 
      speaks Mongolian and the door is closed to keep Marco out. 
      The small entourage guards the yurt.

      With CHILDREN gathering around him, curious, Marco remains 
      out in the yurt camp. HARD-EYED GUARDS keep watch on the 
      foreigner.



      INT. ARIQ S ROYAL YURT - DAY6969

      Ariq and Jingim walk clockwise in the vast circle of the 
      great yurt, its walls lined with snow leopard pelts and 
      ornate wooden saddles. Primitive elegance.

                                  ARIQ
                    ...this one they call the Cricket 
                    Minister, he is a snake in the 
                    grass. How many soldiers did he 
                    have laying in wait at Wuchang?

                                  JINGIM
                    Not too many for a Mongol army. If 
                    only our reinforcements showed up.

                                  ARIQ
                    Jingim. You did not attack without 
                    me --

                                  JINGIM
                    -- You almost got me killed! My 
                    General Aruka is dead!

      Jingim steadies himself, the Confucian and the Barbarian at 
      war inside him. Ariq remains composed.

                                  ARIQ
                    The spring rains cut off passage of 
                    the Blue Horde. East of Volga. I 
                    did not have enough horses to make 
                    the journey.

                                  JINGIM
                    You could have sent a messenger.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1267.

                    I did. My best rider -- Duwa. 

      As they stroll the circumference, Ariq reaches into a 
      basket... and lifts a human head; a distinctly Mongolian face 
      frozen in death. Jingim almost retches.

                                  ARIQ (CONT D)
                    He never made it. They captured him 
                    one hundred miles outside of 
                    Wuchang. Tied his head to his 
                    horse, let it run home. Right to 
                    his yurt... and his children.

      He resentfully returns the gruesome head to the basket.



      EXT. KARAKORUM - GRAIN STORAGE - DAY7070

      Marco is wandering casually, taking in the sight of HUNDREDS 
      OF HORSES pastured close to the city. As he moves past one, 
      he pats it, feels its ribs.

      Now he moves over to large adobe cisterns of grain. He 
      surveys, touches some. Scoops a handful, lets it sift through 
      his fingers...



      INT. ARIQ S ROYAL YURT - DAY7171

      Ariq and Jingim reach the horse-hide crocks of kumis. Ariq 
      pours graciously. Looks his nephew in the eye.

                                  ARIQ
                    When you were a child, I called you

      Marco is walking back through Ariq s vast herds when he stops 
      and examines. A MONGOL HERDSMAN stands by, watching the round-
      eye with suspicion.

                                  MARCO

                    Mongolian ponies. Finest in all the 
                    world.

      The Herdsman flinches when the white boy speaks native 
      tongue. But the comment makes him beam.

                    these are uncommon beasts. May I 
                    see?

      The Herdsman proudly allows Marco to poke below the loin of a 
      horse, then lift its leg to examine a hoof.

      Then a GREAT COMMOTION draws his eyes to --

      TRADITIONAL DRUMMING and festivity. Jingim is outside the 
      Royal Yurt with his uncle; all is jovial.

      MARCO lowers the horse s leg, dusts his hands off and makes a 
       fine horse  breath sound to the Herdsman who returns it.

      Hundred Eyes stands before a SMALL ARMY OF KHAN SOLDIERS, 
      training them in Wudang weapon attacks. At the sound of 
      HORNS, DOGS BARKING, and THREE BELLS FROM THE CLOCK, the monk 
      grows silent.

      HOOFBEATS announce the return of Prince Jingim and his 
      Entourage, Marco among them.

                    I found the Great Khan s brother to 
                    be a gracious host and honorable 
                    man. Just as Prince Jingim says.

      Jingim seems to appreciate that as they stroll past imported 
      plants and rare peacocks.

      Kublai stops in the long portico. Jingim stops, too. Marco 
      hesitates, seemingly weighing what he can say and what he 
      can t.

      Jingim stares at Marco, watches the Latin make his fateful 
      decision.

      Kublai digests this, deeply troubled. Jingim seethes --

                    Do you accuse my uncle, the Khan s

                    see, as I saw it. 

      Chillingly quiet. Jingim lays his hand on the hilt of his 
      sword. The Khan steadies him, says slowly --

                                  KUBLAI KHAN
                    I will send a night rider to verify

      A COURT EUNUCH, draped in jewels, appears in the portico.

      stands alone with Marco. Stares.

      Jingim turns on his heel and goes.  

      OFF Marco, pale and reeling --



      INT. MARCO S QUARTERS - NIGHT7575

      Urgently, Marco digs under his bedding, grabs two horse-hide 
      canteens. He shoves them into leather saddle bags. He 
      uncovers the stolen sword, rusted at the hilt.

      He goes to the lute-shaped window.

      EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - NIGHT7878

      Marco trots out steadily... looks over his shoulder... then 
      swings his Mongolian wrist-whip over and under. Ba-Tu bolts!

      Marco leans forward in saddle, making an escape. Breathless, 
      he BUSTS OUT onto the open grasslands, whips Ba-Tu harder.  
      He s going for it. 

      But now OTHER HOOFBEATS pound earth. Gaining. A LONE RIDER 
      pursuing. Whipping faster, harder, Marco drives Ba-Tu at a 
      full canter. But --

      In seconds, the Lone Rider overtakes him, lassos Ba-Tu, yanks 
      hard. Marco is thrown ass-over-stirrups to the ground.

      The Lone Rider circles him. 

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                    The sword you stole is weak. Your

                      I challenged the word of Ariq the

      EXT. CAMBULAC - TRAINING GROUNDS - NEXT DAY7979

      Marco is going spear against sword versus Hundred Eyes, but 
      the monk avoids or deflects every thrust. Marco is breathless; 
      Hundred Eyes hasn t broken a sweat.

      He strips Marco of his sword, knocks it to the grass.

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                    Why do you think the sword has a 
                    colored sash? To look pretty? Do
                    you wish to fight your opponent? Or 
                    fuck him?

      Marco picks up the sword and this time wraps the sash around 
      his wrist. HOOFBEATS. Steady, intent. Jingim rides up, 
      dismounts. 

                                  JINGIM
                    He s advanced quickly to the 
                      broadsword. You train him well, 
                    Hundred Eyes.

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                    I must. If any harm befalls him, I 
                    am held accountable.

                                  JINGIM
                    May I join practice?

                    You re the Prince. You may kill him 
                    if that s your desire.

      Marco throws a sardonic look at Hundred Eyes as the monk 
      walks away a neutral distance. Marco stands half-ready with 
      his broadsword, the sash hanging long. Jingim moves with a 
      grace that is terrifying in its slow, flowing, controlled 
      beauty.

      As he circles Marco, the Venetian does a reverse shuffle step --
      a la Venetian fencing style. Hundred Eyes senses something, or 
      hears it in the breeze.

      Marco remembers: Quickly wraps the sash around his wrist just 
      as Jingim lunges and thrusts. Marco blocks and parries --the 
      sword match is on! Jingim wields his weapon like a paint 
      brush, every slash and stab refined and containing uncanny 
      internal power.

      Jingim is playing with him; taunting him. And then he brings 
      it. Hard. Marco slides into  dropping horse  then wheels and 
      slashes, almost catches Jingim off-guard. The Prince drives 
      Marco backward, baffles him with footwork, then delivers an 
      utter BEAT DOWN.

      Hundred Eyes, even in his detached state, almost moves in. 
      But it s over. Marco is on his back, swordless. Jingim s 
       scholar s blade  is at this throat. Precisely.

                    You were right.

      Marco reacts. Wasn t expecting that.

      Jingim starts to his horse, half-turns; a true scholar-
      warrior, he bows to Hundred Eyes. Hundred Eyes gives a 
      slight, informal head bow in return.

      As Jingim mounts and rides off --

                    I d hate to see what he d do if you

      Excitement on the battlements. General Red Brow assumes a 
      vantage point..

      RED BROW S POV: In the distance, the Mongol Troops are 
        withdrawing; a slow march home in a shroud of humid haze and 
      dust. A miracle...

                    They are withdrawing...

      Chancellor Jia Sidao appears. Looks out, containing his joy.

      As OFFICERS GATHER to watch, one of them approaches the 
      Chancellor, whispers at his ear.



      INT. XIANGYANG - EMPEROR S CHAMBERS - DAY8282

      Chancellor Jia Sidao enters, regards the grieving Empress. It 
      is clear that the Emperor has finally expired.

                    there is no cure. My condolences,

                      Eventually we all become white

                    left a nephew. Bow to the new 
                    Emperor, Zhao Xian.

      The Chancellor looks over at the five year-old boy playing on 
      the floor. It s the same precocious child that once tried to 
      abuse his crickets.

      It takes everything the Chancellor has to dip his chin 
      slightly to the heir.

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    With sad news, Empress, there also 
                    comes good. The devil Kublai has 
                    withdrawn his troops.

      The old woman gazes up, surprised, tears in her cataracts, 
      but hopeful.

                    The barbarians know that your 
                      Chancellor will never surrender the

                    back. We can count on that.

                    I fear you do count on it, Sidao.  
                    I fear you thirst for it. 

      She turns away. Sidao again bows to the child. The child 
      throws some pottery shards at the floor, fascinated by how 
      they break.



      INT. MEI LIN S CHAMBERS - DAY8383

      Mei Lin sits on the edge of her bed, embracing her young 
      daughter. She sings a Chinese children s song, soothes the 
      girl softly. Together they mourn the Emperor.

      Then her door opens. THREE SONG SOLDIERS enter. Filthy, 
      sleeveless, and baring Song Dynasty tattoos. They just stand 
      there, looking Mei Lin over. The concubine gently whispers in 
      her daughter s ear. The girl grabs a doll and leaves. When 
      she s gone, a Soldier closes the door.

                    The Chancellor Jia Sidao has 
                    granted us permission...

                                  MEI LIN
                    My Emperor is dead, but I am still 
                    an Imperial Consort. I do not bed 
                    soldiers. 

      The Soldiers must have heard differently from the Chancellor; 
      they smirk and begin to unfasten their sword belts, lean 
      their halberds in the corners. One of them gestures to her 
      roughly with a wing sword.

      Cornered, Mei Lin wisely considers her choices. She rises 
      slowly, elegantly. She stands before them in flickering 
      candle light... and lets her silk robe slip off one shoulder. 
      She unbelts her robe and lets it open, revealing a view that 
      excites the hungry warriors.

      Slowly she turns, playing the candle light, reaches up to 
      undo her bun.

                    Two Eels, One Cave... do you know

      They are captivated by the promise, by her tai chi-like 
      movements as she removes the jade pin, lets her hair drop 
      long...

                                  MEI LIN (CONT D)
                    It will cost you.

      She wheels and --

      UNLEASHES THE JADE PIN

      Across the room, dead-center into the swordsman s throat.

      Mei Lin whirls in silk, undulates, and kicks a Second Soldier 
      brutally against the wall. As she re-chambers, she toe-flips 
      a sword up from the floor into her left hand -- even as she 
      pirouettes -- and impales the Third Soldier. Effortlessly.

      The Second Soldier recovers, grabs his bladed halberd. But 
      Mei Lin side-steps and cuts his windpipe with the wing sword. 
      His eyes stare at her in utter shock...

      With all three dead, the quarters resume a hypnotic candle-
      flicker. Mei Lin belts her robe. MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1280.

      INT. HALL OF HARMONIOUS PURCHASE - LATE DAY8484

      A PURSE OF COINS clanks onto a table. Marco helps Sanga 
      unload saddle bags of coins and paper notes on a long table 
      before Ahmad, the Minister of Finance.

      An impish IMPERIAL AIDE beside him records figures in the 
      royal books.

                                  AHMAD
                    Marco Polo. The Khan speaks highly 
                    of you. 

      Marco just keeps unloading bags.

                    What is this gift I hear of? The 
                    foreign messenger who can paint 
                    pictures with his words...

      As Marco returns to the saddle bags to help Sanga haul, he 
      notes: Sanga lays a hand on the linen payment... then covers 
      it covertly with a flap of leather. He then hands Marco a 
      bundle of paper notes to bring to the accounting table.

      Ahmad scans the ledger, reviews the deposits, then looks 
      Sanga directly in the eye.

                                  AHMAD (CONT D)
                    Have you reported all?

                                  SANGA
                    I have, Good Minister Ahmad.

      Ahmad speaks UZBEK to his Aide and the Aide closes the tax 
      book. Sanga bows, turns. But as Marco begins to follow...

                                  AHMAD
                    Master Marco. Stay.

      Sanga hesitates, looks at Ahmad... then at Marco.

                                  SANGA
                    Goodbye, my Venetian slave. Ciao.

      With a nudge and a laugh, Sanga leaves. Ahmad smiles, amused 
      by the eccentric tax man.

                    So if the Jurchens have been paying 
                    in linen... why hasn t Sanga

                    I didn t say that Sanga collected 
                    any linens, I said that the Jurchens

                    truths in the grand stories you 
                    tell. Like the truth about his

      Lin to him, a cold and detached look in her eye.

      At a signal, the Soldiers leave him alone with his sister.

                    For what you did, Mei Lin, you can

      Now, the Chancellor can see something in her eyes. He can 
      hear the laughter of children, sees her trying not to look as 
      her daughter and the five year-old Boy Emperor run by. The

      With that last stab, she leaves. The Chancellor watches her 
      go, then looks down at the military courtyard.MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1284.

      EXT. XIANGYANG - MILITARY COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER8686

      The SONG REBEL ARMY stands amassed on the military floor, a 
      frightening sight. They REPEAT A FIERCE CHANT at the command 
      of General Red Brow. Then the fortress town falls chillingly 
      silent.

      The Chancellor appears before them, dandified in his ornate 
      robes.

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    A more fierce army I have never 
                    seen. It is no wonder the 
                      barbarians fled.

      MASS MILITARY CHANT. Then deep silence again.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                    But it s come to the attention of 
                    your Prime Minister that some of 
                    his great soldiers have questioned 
                    the political order of the Song 
                    Court now that the Emperor has 
                    died.

      THE FACES OF THE SOLDIERS could be terra-cotta. SWEAT doesn t 
      drip, it courses over their branded tattoos.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                    General. Who is the best fighter in 
                    your esteemed army?

                                    GENERAL RED BROW
                    Yang Chun!

      The SOLDIER who steps forward is six cubits and a span tall, 
      sleeveless armor revealing arms like Burmese pythons. His 
      hair and beard are insane -- a perfect example of the kind of 
      marsh outlaws and mercenaries among these Song rebels.

      Called out to the floor, he towers over --

                                    GENERAL RED BROW (CONT D)
                    In Shantung Province, he is called 
                    Whirlwind Tiger. He has mastered 
                    the Five Animal Styles of Shaolin.

      Whirlwind Tiger bows deeply, every sinew rippling.

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    Whom do you serve?

                    The walls have ears, my friend. 
                    What do the men say about my study 
                    of crickets? My Praying mantis 
                    games...

      Uncomfortable beat.

                                  WHIRLWIND TIGER
                    With humility and respect, some 
                    have spoken of the Chancellor s 
                    insect games as a... curious hobby.

      Chancellor Jia Sidao digests this.

                                  WHIRLWIND TIGER (CONT D)
                    Those were the only words whispered, 
                    Great Chancellor.

      The Chancellor stares intently into the small eyes of the big 
      soldier. Perhaps he will let it go. Then he smiles. Holding 
      his arms out he summons a PAGE to remove his silk robe. The 
        Chancellor s underlayer is a black silk uniform with white 
      collar.

      Whirlwind Tiger shifts his hard eyes as the smaller man 
      begins to circle him, slowly.

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    Show me your Five Animal Kung Fu.
                    Defeat me and you are promoted to a 
                    command post -- with all the 
                    residual income and pleasures.

      Whirlwind Tiger carefully shifts his weight as the Chancellor 
      tightens the casual circle.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                      However... if I defeat you, you are 
                    my chamber boy.

      Whirlwind Tiger seethes, but contains it. The Chancellor 
      makes a sudden move into a ready stance. Whirlwind Tiger 
      refuses to engage.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                    Insult me, you die. Show me why
                    they fear you here and why the name 
                    Whirlwind Tiger is famous.

      Jia Sidao throws a finger jab; Whirlwind Tiger blocks it, 
      effortlessly. Jia Sidao smiles. Game on, he circles faster. 
      Tiger drops low into a  Coiling Dragon  stance and deftly 
      establishes his fighting measure.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1286.

      The entire army stands rapt as the two square off. Then Jia 
      Sidao lunges at the soldier with a flurry of strikes and 
      kicks. Whirlwind Tiger deflects them all and lands a  Crane 
      Strike  (his hand held beak-like) to the neck of the Prime 
      Minister.

      Emboldened, he whirls with a spinning ax kick, and that s 
      when it happens: The Chancellor traps the kick with his hands 
      held in an uncanny imitation of a praying mantis snatching an 
      insect. Whirlwind Tiger spins free and attacks with a flurry 
      of  Snake Strikes ...

      The Chancellor intercepts every blow with Praying Mantis 
      Style moves and then fires a lightning-quick stab to the 
      bridge of the soldier s nose, dropping him.

      A GREAT HUSH of awe spreads through the fortress.

      ANGLE ON: THE FORTRESS BRIDGE -- Mei Lin, being escorted out, 
      stops to watch.

      BACK ON the Chancellor standing over the fallen soldier.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                    On your feet. You may take a
                    weapon.

      Whirlwind Tiger rolls to his feet, sweating even harder. He 
      cannot believe what he is tangling with.

      Whirlwind Tiger hesitates a beat then turns to the phalanx, 
      grabs a broadsword. He spins at the chancellor,  flowering  
      the sword in a deadly blur and goes for his head.

      The Chancellor doesn t simply emulate a praying mantis, he 
      seems to channel its essence (hands held up like mantis 
      claws, his torso rocking and swaying) as he lures in his 
      opponent s force, clasps the sword arm in a  hooking hand,  
      twists low, and BREAKS THE SOLDIER S ELBOW with a sound like 
      splintered wood.

      SLOW MOTION: The Chancellor goes airborne and SPINS 360 with 
      a kick that fractures the jaw. As Whirlwind Tiger falls, 
      Chancellor goes with him, shooting a Mantis Hand at a vital 
      meridian point under the big man s arm and paralyzing him.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                    Praying Mantis Kung Fu. Curious 
                    little hobby, yes?

      The Chancellor drives the broadsword downward, his knee on 
      the blade and CUTS THE SOLDIER S HEAD OFF (in a move called 
       Mantis Beheads Its Prey ).





                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1287.

      Now he stands before the army taking great satisfaction in 
      their transfixed gazes. He holds his arms out and the Page 
      hurries to him, helps him back into his silk robe.

                    One rotten log can weaken the
                    forest. 

      As the Chancellor exits, General Red Brow takes over, 
      SHOUTING COMMANDS.

      FROM THE FORTRESS BRIDGE: Mei Lin watching. But it s time for 
      her to leave.



      EXT. CAMBULAC - ARENA OF THE HORSES/PAVILION - DAY8787

      MONGOL HORSEMEN are practicing war games. 

      Hundred Eyes stands down on the field, listening as a RAM S 
      HORN is sounded and --

      A Mongol Rider explodes out of formation and gallops across 
      the arena. A Second Horseman is charging toward him, each 
      armed with a 12 foot lasso pole. They COLLIDE at center and 
      the Second Horseman ropes the First off his horse.

      ANGLE ON: A Pavilion -- The Khan sits with his Four Wives, 
      watching the war games. Nearby, BARONS and OTHER NOBLES sit 
      as well. Among them, Kokachin, her Attendants, and Za Bing 
      the Eunuch.

      DOWN IN THE ARENA -- The victorious Mongol Rider races toward 
      -- THE FORMATION...

      Where Jingim looks at the next horseman over. It is Marco, 
      wearing leather plated armor and helmet.

      Here he is again! In tag-team fashion, A RIDER touches the 
      poll of Marco s horse. Ba-Tu rockets forward, Marco clutching 
      his lasso pole. GREAT CHEERS go up, mixed with AMUSED 
      LAUGHTER.

      HUNDRED EYES cocks his head, feeling the feverish hoofbeats 
      punch past him, weighing the nuance of the laughter.

      ON HIS HORSE, Marco storms Byaamba.

                                    BYAAMBA (CONT D)

      THE PAVILION. The Khan observes, expressionless. His wife 
      Chabi leans close while the Three Other Wives TRILL wildly.

                                  CHABI
                    Your son, Byaamba.

                      Distinguished with the lance. Who

                                  CHABI
                    Young Polo.

      The Khan watches, intrigued. KOKACHIN stops fanning herself, 
      and takes interest. 



      EXT. CAMBULAC - ARENA OF THE HORSES/PAVILION - DAY8989

      Marco and Byaamba charge each other like a cross between 
      Cheyenne warriors and medieval knights. As they collide, 
      Marco slams Byaamba with his lasso pole, but the Mongolian 
      deftly lands the loop around Marco s horse s head and makes 
      him rear.

      Marco is thrown from his saddle to a great burst of TRILLS 
      and HOLLERS. Byaamba prances his horse around him to rub in 
      the victory.

      ANGLE ON: THE PAVILION -- Kokachin stands in worried reflex. 
      All eyes go to her. Slowly, she sits again, fanning herself. 
      Za Bing, standing guard, looks at her for a long moment...

      DOWN IN THE ARENA -- A KETTLE DRUM is booming now. Marco, 
      getting back into saddle, feels a horse trot by closely.

                                  MONGOL GENERAL
                    You. Latin. We need you at East 
                    Flag.

      Marco quickly mounts Ba-Tu and joins in --

      A MONGOL ROUND-UP AND DRIVE.

      As 100 HORSES are released from a holding pen and allowed 
      into the arena. With great fanfare -- and the DRUM STILL 
      BEATING -- Marco, Byaamba, Jingim, Aju, and other horsemen 
      drive the wild herd up and down the arena.

      ON A THIRD PASS -- MARCO sees a rolled and tethered carpet in 
      the dusty arena center. HOOVES STAMPEDE over it, crushing it. 
      Then circle back...

                                  MARCO 
                    Jingim! What s in the carpet, 
                    millet? Are we milling grain?

      Jingim does a take, as his horse passes Marco.

                                  JINGIM
                    Sanga. Sanga is in the carpet.

                                  MARCO
                    Sanga? I don t understand...

      Marco watches the HORSE HERD PULVERIZE the carpet for a fifth 
      time.

                                  JINGIM
                    His tax deposits did not balance.

      Jingim and Marco watch as the carpet is unrolled and the 
      broken body of Sanga rolls out into the dirt.

                                  JINGIM (CONT D)
                    He was given an honorable death.

                    blood...

      But the look in Jingim s eyes is no more hardened than 
      Marco s. He doesn t like it. But he rides on, working his 
      whip at the rear of the herd. Marco just sits on his saddle, 
      observing Mongol justice. He does not join in for a sixth 
      stampede. He looks up at --

      INT. MARCO S QUARTERS - NIGHT9090

      Marco destroys his quarters, turning things over. He punches 
      the mahogany wall, knocks over his calligraphy board. Then he 
      looks at his self-ransacked belongings and spots something; 
      the silver cross given to him by his father.

      He sits on his bed, picks up the cross. Closes it in a fist. 
      Mourning Sanga; praying; soul searching. The eerie drone of 
      MONGOLIAN THROAT SINGING rises up...



      EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - NIGHT9191

      Marco stands alone, under the vast night sky, Ba-Tu grazing 
      near. He studies the stars for compass and direction. Should 
      he make a run for the Silk Road? Or risk death going into 
      battle with the Khan s men?  

      Then he spots a Night Rider moving secretly toward a lone 
      tree.  

      POV: Kokachin drops back her head, looks around. She 
      dismounts and approaches the tree, kneels. From a woven bag, 
      she removes a jewel -- looks around again -- then buries it.

      Now she ties some kind of silk ribbon in the tree...

      Marco watches her lope back to the gates of Cambulac. He 
      wonders. But now the MONGOLIAN THROAT-SINGING is rising 
      louder...

      Marco, armored -- sword at his hip, quiver and bow at his 
      back -- slowly rides Ba-Tu (the horse is armored, too) at the 
      rear of the march. He does a take when he sees --

      Jingim, riding in a division of  10  closer to the rear than 
      to the front. Demoted to quartermaster, he is no longer 
      leading a detachment. He leads a group that includes his half-
      brother Byaamba.

      As Marco studies this uncomfortable dynamic:

                                  JINGIM
                    What is General Bataar doing with 
                    the lancers? Who leads us north? 

      That seems to be the prevailing question throughout the mass 
      of troops. Then NACCARANA DRUMS begin to boom. The LIGHT 
      INFANTRY BEGINS TO PART, clearing a path.

      Riding out from the Imperial Palace, flanked by MOUNTED 
      GUARDS is Kublai Khan. He might be overweight, beginning to 
      age, but in his leather-plated armor and iron-spiked helmet, 
      he looks every bit the warrior king, grandson of Genghis.

      ALL OF CAMBULAC GOES PRIMAL. Deafening THROAT SINGING and

      boqta, flanked by her GUARDS and BUDDHIST ADVISORS (who burn 
      incense). The Other Three Wives are there, too, watching the 
      Khan ride to the front.

      NEAR THE REAR OF THE MARCH -- Jingim bows his head with the 
      others as his father rides fiercely toward the front.

      The gigantic eunuch hurries alongside Marco s horse, offers 
      something up to him.

                    Somebody wishes for you to have 
                    this. On your journey.

      Marco receives a Chinese fan, painted and perfumed. He opens 
      the ivory spine and it accordions into a delicate image of 
      two flying cranes.

                                  MARCO
                    Please send my gratitude to Her

                    Master Marco. It s from me.

      Za Bing gazes up with his kohl-painted eyelids. Then he 
      offers up something wrapped in silk.

                    This is from the Blue Princess.

      Marco unwraps a small dagger with an ornate hilt, jeweled at 
      the top.

      Marco sticks the dagger into his boot sheathe as the surge of 
      moving horses, pushes him toward the gates.

      He realizes now that Hundred Eyes is riding with him. The 
      monk wears no armor -- just his Taoist robe and his topknot 
      drawn long.

      The golden eagle is brought before Ariq who sits in a fur-
      draped throne. It is the same eagle that he gifted to his big 
      brother; he stares confused for a second.

      Ariq unties the small leather pouch laced into the eagle s 
      anklet. He opens it and spills out: An iron arrow head, 
      broken off from the bamboo shaft.

      Ariq studies it for a moment, then closes it in his fist. He 
      makes a guttural breath sound. Whatever it means is animal...

      Coming over a grassy crest, backlit by a fireball of sun: 
      TEAMS of WHITE OXEN pull a Royal Yurt on a cart. 

      PULLING UP TO ARIEL VIEW: A great mounted march of THOUSANDS 
      OF MONGOL HORSE SOLDIERS, some of heavy armor and artillery, 
      some of light.

      BEHIND THE MARCH: ANOTHER WAVE OF MOUNTED HORSEMEN, the lance-
      carriers; and BEHIND THEM: Camels and pack-horses, DRUMMERS, 
      and the Venetian, Marco Polo.

      MONGOL WOMEN and BOYS ride in a great squadron at the back, 
      moving with HERDS OF SHEEP (portable commissary).

      RIDING UP FRONT -- WITH THE LIGHT CAVALRY: Kublai Khan, his 
      eyes forward. He is sweating. Pale. The march is putting a 
      strain on. When he stops riding, the ENTIRE ARMY STOPS. The 
      Khan seems to drink in the silence on the Steppe. 

      There it is: a distant hum like a great swarm of bees.

      Ariq scans a deep grassy valley. With chilling fluidity for a 
      big man, he nocks an arrow. Aims. Fires.

      The arrow is called a  screamer,  has a hole through the iron 
      head so that it banshees on trajectory, arcs long, whistles 
      downward... plants deep in the earth, a hundred yards south.

      Kublai standing alone, staring into the distance. General Aju 
      stands off a few yards behind him.

      INT. LONE YURT - MOMENTS LATER102102

      Kublai and Ariq sit on the ground, facing each other. A fire 
      warms the space nearby. Kublai rattles his fist and tosses 
      several little bones to the ground. It is the traditional 
      Mongolian game of  horses  played with the ankle bones of a 
      sheep.

                                  ARIQ

      It begins with a single drum, the war pulse of the Naccarana 
      drums. The THROAT-SINGING begins to DRONE...

      Two massive armies, five ranks each, face each other from 
      across the golden valley. 

      AT THE REAR OF THE KHAN S FIFTH RANK, Marco takes in the 
      sight, lifts his eyes toward higher ground.

      Marco looks out toward distant hills now, sees birds coming 
      up out of the fog. That s what Hundred Eyes seems to be 
      listening to; invisible warriors everywhere. 

      Then the THROAT-SINGING ENDS. The DRUMMING STOPS. The silence 
      is death-like. Suffocating. From the hill, Kublai nocks an 
      arrow. He draws back the bow... he FIRES A SCREAMER.

      This triggers the raising of BLACK FLAGS from the next hill 
      over. What follows is done in eerie silence:

      THE KHAN S TWO FRONT RANKS OF HEAVY CAVALRY -- Mounted on 
        heavily-armored horses remain motionless as the remaining 
      THREE RANKS OF LIGHT CAVALRY come galloping through the gaps 
      in the Front Ranks and FIRE A VOLLEY OF ARROWS into the sky 
      (into a predetermined  killing zone  to break up the enemy 
      formation).

      Jingim is one of these Light Archers, just one of the 
      soldiers now. He launches his arrow skyward, then wheels his 
      speedy horse, gallops back.

      ARIQ S SECOND RANK -- Catch arrows in their shields, or in 
      their bodies even as their own LIGHT ARCHERS storm through 
      their own gaps, doing the same.

      JINGIM -- Turns in his saddle, completely around, and times 
      his next arrow (and breath) with the split second that all 
      four of his horse s hooves are off the ground.

      The entire wing of Light Archers does the same, all in 
      harmony. The  Parthian shot.  And as they race back, they now 
      begin an encircling sweep toward the enemy flank.

      AT THE REAR OF THE FIFTH RANK -- Marco raises his leather 
      shield as ARROWS RAIN DOWN. He catches several concussive 
      hits, then lowers the shield. Suddenly, Hundred Eyes moves 
      his own shield at an angle and catches two more  heavies  
      that would have planted in Marco s neck and shoulder.

      ALL AROUND MARCO now, NACCARA DRUMS are beaten from the backs 
      of camels. No more silence. The KHAN S FRONT TWO RANKS scream 
      like demons loosed from Hell... and surge forward.

      him, he catches the chain with his lance, lets it wrap around 
      the shaft, then yanks the warrior off his horse.

      -- Byaamba gallops over this fallen warrior, CRUSHING HIS 
      BONES inside his armor. In the same surge, Byaamba swings his 
      blades and opens the entrails of an oncoming warrior...

      Ariq gives a calm order. A General repeats it and FLAGS ARE 
      RAISED.

      A THIRD RANK OF ARIQ S MEN gallop toward a NEW SURGE OF KHAN 
      HORSEMEN. But the trick is: Ariq s men each transport a LANCE 
      MAN  hitching a ride  on the right stirrup of each horse.

      Halfway into the charge, the Lance Men drop off the stirrup 
      and prop their spears as the horsemen wheel around and 
      retreat (firing  Parthian Shots ).

      THE KHAN S HORSEMEN plow right into this field of low spears, 
      their horses impaled. One of the ambushed men, the GENERAL in 
      Jingim s wing, pitches from his horse, pierced by a half-
      dozen arrows.

      As the surviving horsemen in the wing fall into disarray, 
      Jingim rides to the wedge point.

                                  JINGIM
                    Tulughma! Tulughma!

      When the men witness Jingim bravely taking over, they fall 
      back in with him. The Crown Prince charges at his uncle s 
      troops, leading his archers. 

      SUDDENLY: A Lancer comes up out of the grass and Jingim s 
      horse is pierced through the breast. But Jingim isn t pitched 
      from saddle; he times it with a leap....

      SLOW MOTION: Jingim goes airborne and double crane-kicks TWO 
      SOLDIERS, runs his scholar s sword through the eye of a 
      THIRD. 

      In the fray, a wounded but fierce GOLDEN HORDE WARRIOR 
      squares off with Jingim.

                    You. Cousin. I laugh at you. You 
                    fight like a Chinese.

      He attacks with a massive sabre. Jingim blocks, parries, 
      slices his throat like a calligraphy touch.

                                  JINGIM
                          (Mongolian)
                    So I ve been told.

      The Golden Horde Warrior bleeds out on his quivering knees, 
      watching Jingim spin into  Cat Stance  and impale another.

      AT THE REAR OF THE FIFTH RANK -- Marco is trying to restrain 
      Ba-Tu who smells horse blood and wants to run -- either into 
      battle or away from it, doesn t matter. The young horse just 
      wants to run.

      As Marco  bends  his horse into a controlled circle, his eyes 
      pick up SHADOWS in the FOG BEHIND.

      MARCO S POV: Here they come. Ariq s ELITE WING RIDERS, like

                    I m wondering. If you live through 
                    this, does the Khan want you to 
                    describe the battle in all it s 
                    glory? Over a drink of wine?

      The Elite Death Squad is trotting hard at them...

      Braided into the mane are heavy, rusted, iron points. The

      A FOURTH RIDER EXPLODES from the mist. Marco reacts, blocks a 
      spear attack, slashes the Fourth Soldier s wrist, cuts him so 
      deeply across the neck, he crumples in saddle before being 
      swallowed by the battle.

      Hundred Eyes smiles, darkly. Now he HEARS what MARCO SEES: A 
      DOZEN MORE ELITE WING RIDERS coming hard.

                      Retreating shot. Go.

      Ba-Tu rockets away. The blind monk turns now, faces the 
      onslaught. His right hand holds a broadsword, his left 
      reaches to a scabbard and pulls out something Ariq s men have 
      never seen: A short spear combined with a dagger-axe.  

      The blind monk meets the charge of Golden Horde.

      THROUGH A NARROW VALLEY OF BLOODY GRASS -- Marco is galloping 
      for his life. He looks over his shoulder, only seeing FOG.

      SUDDENLY: TWO HORSES jump him from tall grass, cause his 
      mount to scream and rear. He is thrown, lands hard. Face 
      down.

      TWO MOUNTED WARRIORS move in. One is armed with a Turko-
      Mongol sabre, the Other grips a two-bladed halberd. Asiatic 
      faces, wind-burned and fierce; Nomads of the Steppe. 

      One Mongol catches the riderless horse, the other dismounts, 
      all business. Still, a THIRD MONGOL WARRIOR rides up now, 
      cold-eyed. He dismounts, draws a mace.  

      Marco rolls to his feet, his helmet somewhere in the grass, 
      his cowl down.

      The Mongols are about to attack when they realize he is a 
      white man. It freezes them for a moment. 

      The Third Mongol chambers his mace, is about to cave the 
      Westerner s head when --

      toward the warrior on the horse, takes a cautious step 
      backward... scheming a way out...

      As he cautiously backs his way toward the high grass, he 
      becomes aware of a FOURTH MONGOL behind him --

      THE WARRIORS ATTACK!

      Marco ducks a sabre, rolls from the path of the double 
      halberd. It SLASHES at him again. He rolls again, alarmed. 
      Now a hook-scythe comes at him. 

      Marco slaps at his leather boot and draws Kokachin s Kerait 
      dagger.

      The Third Mongol charges with a brutal five-blossom spin of a 
      scimitar. He cuts Marco s leather plates, but the young 
      foreigner  swallows  his opponent s momentum...

      SLOW MOTION: Marco spins 180 and impales the attacker with an 
      inverted stab of the blade at the same time he fires a 
      balletic round kick, disabling the Halberd Warrior. 

      The Fourth Mongol is stunned by this unlikely display of 
      Chinese martial arts. But not as stunned as Marco; competent 
      skill aside, the young man is sweat-drenched and unnerved as --

      MONGOLIAN SOLDIERS flood the valley. THROAT SINGING chills 
      his blood...

      MARCO SWEEPS A HANDFUL OF SAND at the Fourth Warrior s face. 
      He then grabs the stirrup of his escaping horse, makes a 
      desperate running mount...

      BEHIND HIM: That HORSEBACK MONGOL sets chase with Double Fire 
      Meteor Hammers, two spherical weights connected by a chain, 
      filled with fuel and lit afire.

      Marco gallops for his life across the Steppe. He rides well, 
      but not as well as the Flying Hammer Rider gaining on him at 
      breakneck speed...

      Marco lifts his small, Mongolian-style recurve bow. Draws an 
      arrow from his quiver, nocks it. Turning around in the saddle 
      -- completely around -- he raises the bow. 

      ALL SOUND FADES. Only MARCO S PULSE -- in his face.

      SLOW MOTION  Marco times his breath with the exact half-beat 
      in which all four of his horse s legs leave the ground -- and 
      he RELEASES A WHISTLING ARROW...

      And it misses. Cleanly.

      rights... when a RED TASSELLED SPEAR IMPALES HIM.

      The Horseman who did the job keeps galloping past in the 
      opposite direction. Before he vanishes in the mist, he looks 
      over his shoulder. Jingim. Almost like rubbing it in.

      Marco finally breathes.

      Kublai gazes out. A Guard hands him a horse-hide container of 
      drink. He takes a swig, wipes his lips.

      behind, over the hills and bluffs, TWO RANKS OF NORTH CHINESE 
      FOOT SOLDIERS, armed with exotic variations on the 18 Weapons

      Ariq is fighting like a rabid bear. In full armor he wields 
      his 2-foot sabre, severing limbs and crushing skulls. He 
      takes out three, four, five at a time.

      Still, the numbers are too great; he finds himself overcome, 
      surrounded by the Khan s Chinese and Mongolian warriors. 
      Byaamba is at the helm, breathing like a wounded animal and

      saddle.

      Kublai contemplates. With great effort he dismounts from a 
      creaking saddle and approaches his kneeling, restrained 
      brother. As he walks up on him, he unsheathes his sabre.

                    Give him his sword.

      No one moves. Even Ariq looks up, not sure he heard right.  
      After a moment, Byaamba who hustles to the task, picks up the 
      bloody steel and brings it to Ariq.

      The Khan s Soldiers release Ariq, let him get to his boots.  
      He grips his sword with two hands.

      At a gesture from the Khan, the men spread out into a great 
      circle. Riding into that circle to observe is Marco. Hundred 
      Eyes brings up the rear.

      His breath is heavier, more labored than his younger, more 
      vital brother s. But his eyes are blank, like those of a 
      killer wolf.

      Slowly, they circle each other. Bucolic Mongolian blue above; 
      grass slick with blood and horse waste below. The Khan lowers 
      his steel as if the weight tires him, or his mind is 
      elsewhere. This is the  silent stance,  trying to draw the 
      opponent out.

      Ariq smiles through caked blood and dirt. He won t be spooked 
      by big brother s deceptively-passive method. Instead, he 
      adopts it himself; the two large men encircle each other in 
      an almost sleepy stagger...

      MARCO looks at Hundred Eyes. The monk has his face turned 
      down toward his saddle, concentrating on the sounds -- the 
      birds, the breaths of the spectators, the absence of clanging 
      steel...

      ARIQ spins suddenly and lunges, Kublai BLOCKS STEEL. Ariq 
      spins again, younger, more lithe. Kublai blocks again... a 
      moment of strength against strength... then the Khan relaxes 
      his blade and lets gravity deliver Ariq. When the Khan goes 
      for a death-swipe, Ariq smacks him upside the helmet with the 
      flat of his blade.

      MARCO looks at Jingim as the CROWD REACTS. Jingim closes his 
      eyes for a moment. Sweat beads at his temples...

      ARIQ circles, lunges and goes for a beheading. Kublai avoids 
      and slashes his brother s torso, cutting deep through leather 
      plates. Ariq goes for another death-swing. Kublai blocks and 
      slashes Ariq s left arm, drawing blood.

      Ariq parries, cuts Kublai s hip, spins and peels the back of 
      his shoulder armor. Smelling blood now, smelling the throne, 
      Ariq turns it on, a frightening Mongol warrior.

      The two brothers go sword-to-sword in a flurry that leaves 
      the older Khan staggered. Now, when he lowers his sword and 
      goes flat-eyed, it is clearly not the  silent stance.  The 
      man is exhausted. Wounded. Stumbling...

      Ariq sees it. Scents it. Hears it in the worried breath 
      sounds of the Khan s own men. And so he launches like a bull 
      yak, swings for the neck.

      Kublai blocks it. Not with his sword. With his heavily 
      armored left arm. He takes the cut deep through the leather 
      plates, into bone. 

      With his right arm, he swings his sabre and cuts Ariq nearly 
      in half. The leader of the Golden Horde tries to spin, but 
      falls numbly to his knees. Across his rib cage, his lamellar 
      armor is turning black with the blood seep. Organ damage.

      The sun glints off his sword, in the grass, a short distance 
      away. The sun glints in his eyes as he takes in the bear-like 
      silhouette of his older brother. Hovering.

                                  ARIQ
                    Please. Older Brother. Let me leave 
                      Karakorum. You will hear my name no 
                    more... 

      Kublai hoists his blade high... and cuts his brother s head 
      off. As Ariq s torso topples and the Steppe drinks blood, 
      Kublai looks out at the surviving, wounded warriors from 
      Ariq s army. The Golden Horde.

      There is little doubt now. Word will travel. Tengri the Sky 
      God has witnessed it. Kublai is Khan of all Khan s. Kublai is 
      still a Mongol.

      He takes a few steps away in silence. For a moment, it 
      appears as if he might topple. Instead, he hands his sword to 
      Byaamba who cleans it on the grass. The Khan walks to his 
      horse. 

      For one moment -- one fleeting moment -- he catches sight of 
      young Marco Polo on his horse. The look the Khan gives seems 
      to say:  This is how I roll, Latin. Write it down. 

      Jingim watches his wounded father helped up into his saddle. 
      The Crown Prince s eyes betray his burdened thoughts. 

      Marco is looking across the circle at Jingim now. He sees 
      that look. Maybe he feels for him. He sees it all...

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO

      EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - BATTLEFIELD - DAY118118

      MONGOLIAN THROAT SINGING rises as we begin our CLOSING 
      MONTAGE. CLOSE ON KUBLAI, JINGIM -- then MARCO, dirty and 
      bloodied and changed.

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    Look outward says the Khan...

      The Great Khan leads his triumphant procession away from the 
      field of battle, toward home. Determination in his eyes, but 
      no triumph.

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    Look outward to new horizons. New 
                    mysteries to unravel, new rivers to 
                    follow...



                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/12109.

      EXT. HANGCHOW - DAY119119

      Mei Lin looks troubled as she prepares to be shipped out in 
      wagons with CHINESE CAPTIVES and DEFECTORS, headed to the 
      Court of the most powerful man on earth...

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    You will travel, the Khan says.  
                    You will see it for me with fresh 
                    eyes.  Write it down...



      EXT. HALL OF FRAGRANCE - DAY120120

      Kokachin stands on her balcony, gazing out. 

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    Write it down and bring it back to 
                    me. Tell me of the rare jewels in 
                    Java...

      She looks across the steppe, a young woman with secrets --



121121INT. XIANGYANG - THE WALLED CITY - DAY 

      Chancellor Jia Sidao bets on his praying mantis fights; 
      strategizing. Ready for the war of all wars. 

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    Tell me of the vast lands I control... 
                    and those left for me to conquer.



      EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - BATTLEFIELD - DAY122122

      BACK ON MARCO as he brings Ba-Tu to a stop. We PULL BACK TO 
      REVEAL Marco alone in a vast land of corpses, carrion left to 
      rot on the Mongolian Steppe.

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    Tell me of my empire... as it 
                    grows...

      Marco rides alone, Kublai s forces receding behind him.  
      Marco steadies himself in the saddle. A man learning control, 
      command. A man come of age.

      A silent moment. Then Marco turns Ba-Tu, gallops through the
