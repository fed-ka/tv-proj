A glimpse of sunlight desperately tries to force its way
through a gray sky before being obliterated.

A MAN, sunburned and bearded, lets himself fall from the edge
of a boat and into the ocean.
D
UNDERWATER, through shafts of light, white limbs are
FLAILING. The MAN struggles, alone. Bubbles stream upward.
He breaks the surface and gasps for air.
He begins to swim. His massive arms and shoulders grab at the
tide in large, hard strokes. His legs and feet are buried
beneath the dark ocean water.

A floating tenement.
A crane LOWERS a fishing net into the water. The MAN swims
into it. The net is RAISED as he lays, motionless, within its
grip.

The crane swings around with the MAN in the net.
He is EMPTIED out onto the deck like a fish.
AHIVERING on the rotting wooden planks he FLIPS himself over
on his stomach. Slowly, using the palms of his hands, he
DRAGS his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a
labored lobster-walk.
He uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge
of the boat. They dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white
and flaccid.
A towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to
him by a CREW PERSON. He pours himself a generous amount of
scotch and begins drinking.

A car pulls over and Franklin is first out, followed by
Louis, walking at a brisk pace as they cross the opposite
side of the street. Louis struggles to keep up while
consulting a small appointment book.
LOUIS
At ten you've got a meeting with
representatives from Pittsburgh
Steel. Their bid on the ship
building contract has already been
turned in and is on your desk for
approval.

FRANKLIN
What did I think of it?
An AFRICAN-AMERICAN man steps off the curb, letting Franklin
and Louis pass.
LOUIS
You had some problems with it.
FRANKLIN
I better read it. Steel workers
tend to vote democratic. Next.
LOUIS
Lunch with Secretary Daniels.
FRANKLIN
Must I?
LOUIS
He's your boss.
FRANKLIN
Anything else?
LOUIS
(a beat)
What if she'd said yes?
FRANKLIN
Who?
Louis shoots him a look that says "you know who."
LOUIS
People know. It's time to stop.
FRANKLIN
I can handle my own affairs, Louis.
LOUIS
Not this one. This is Washington,
D.C., not the Harvard Club.
(off-put by Franklin's
arrogance)
How can you be so cavalier?
FRANKLIN
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Louis takes a quick last drag on his cigarette and follows
him inside a building.

Springwood is the three-story Roosevelt mansion. It is

Franklin, Louis and a PHOTOGRAPHER disembark from a touring car.
LOUIS
We're not taking this defeat lying
down, boss. We'll run you for
Governor --

FRANKLIN
(kidding)
Really? Of which state?
Louis shoots him a look.
LOUIS
Very funny. No, this buys you time.
It buys you experience.
FRANKLIN
What about Al Smith?
LOUIS
He's vulnerable. You're still a
fresh face, boss. We'll use that to
our advantage.
They walk down a hill towards some waiting Boy Scouts as the
PHOTOGRAPHER follows them.
FRANKLIN
Boy Scouts, Louis? Hardly my
political base.
LOUIS
They've got parents. Besides
they're photogenic.
Franklin begins glad-handing the assembled group of mostly
underprivileged children.
FRANKLIN
Franklin Roosevelt, happy to
meet you.
Franklin masks his thinly veiled discomfort with an
artificial good cheer. Meanwhile, Louis, in full political
mode, makes sure the L
Photographer gets everything.
OUIS
Over here!
Franklin poses with two Scouts. The picture is taken.
SCOUTMASTER
Okay, boys, lunch. Line up to wash!
(to Franklin)
Will you be joining us?
FRANKLIN
Of course!
14.
Franklin steps into a line before a large communal water
barrel and glances sideways at GUISEPPE, 9, an immigrant
child of the city streets. He wears his uniform proudly and
smiles at Franklin.
FRANKLIN
What's your name, son?
GUISEPPE
Guiseppe.
Franklin puts his arm around Guiseppe, forcing the moment
between them. He waits patiently as the cameras click away.
FRANKLIN
Guiseppe! Come sta, ragazzo?
GUISEPPE
(puzzled)
Okay, I guess.
The SCOUTS begin washing their hands together in the water
barrel and Franklin joins in as Louis looks on admiringly.
As Guiseppe splashes some of the water on his face, Franklin,
not to be outdone, does so as well. It's all for the cameras.

Eleanor sits quietly on the front porch knitting -- in a
world of her own.
A few feet away -- also in a world of his own -- sits Louis,
overdressed for summer in a three piece suit. An overflowing
ashtray is by his side and piles of newspaper lie at his
feet.
He holds up a paper to Eleanor with the photo of Franklin and
the Boy Scouts.
LOUIS
He's a natural.
Eleanor gives it a cursory glance then looks out to where
Franklin and the children come bounding up the lawn.
15.
Franklin and Elliot break out from the rest and begin racing
up the lawn. Franklin, no match for his son's speed, loses.
He doubles over, trying to catch his breath.
ELLIOT
Vae victis! ("Woe to the
conquered!")
C
aught up in his victory, Elliot doesn't see Franklin sneak
up behind him and tackle him to the ground.
FRANKLIN
Festina lente! ("Not so fast!")
One by one the other children all pile on top of Franklin and
Elliot.
ELEANOR
Dinner is in one half-hour! Come in
and change, children!
FRANKLIN
Up! Up, chicks! You heard your
mother!
Everyone runs up the porch stairs and into the house except
Franklin.
ELEANOR
Go wash up.
Utterly spent, Franklin lays on the grass, not moving.
LOUIS
Hey, boss! Are you all right?
Slowly, Franklin gets up and walks with great effort up the
porch stairs.
FRANKLIN
I'm fine.
(re: her knitting)
Oh, that's pretty, Babs.
He puts his hand on Eleanor's shoulder and leans in to buss
her cheek but Eleanor quickly stands.
ELEANOR
I must check on dinner.
There is a cursory formality to her words and little warmth.
16.
FRANKLIN
Very well.
She goes into the house. Louis then hands Franklin letters.
LOUIS
Tired?
FRANKLIN
Of you? Never.
Wearily, he sorts through the envelopes.
LOUIS
Why don't you nap before dinner?
FRANKLIN
Yes, dear.
Franklin heads into the house leaning heavily against the
screen door struggling for control.

As the door from the sun room opens onto the porch, Elliot is
there waiting. Seeing them coming, he dashes off into the
yard so as not to be seen as Eleanor, Louis, Sara and the

Sara sinks into a chair.

Some experts believe it is linked

It was the visit to that god damned
Boy Scout Camp!
DOCTOR
In all honesty you need to be

The damage to his leg muscles is

ELEANOR
Dear God.

And the children?
DR. LOVETT
If they don't have any symptoms by
now then they have been spared.
Sara stands -- her bearing once again erect and proud.
SARA
Then we must count our blessings.
R. LOVETT
You will need to prepare yourselves.
There is a deep depression that
follows an illness of this magnitude.
I'm afraid life as he knew it is over.
Their discussion is suddenly interrupted by the sound of a
child crying. Eleanor rushes off the porch to the bushes.

Eugene and Stanley carry Franklin off in the driving rain.

TOM LOYLESS, 39, stands waiting by a car dressed in a white
suit. Laconic, with a dry sense of humor, Tom is a man of few
words whose poker face hides a true desperation. He holds a
telegram from Franklin in his hand.
As the train pulls in Tom looks for Franklin among the
passengers making their exit.
There are two different exits on the platform clearly marked
WHITE and COLORED. Whites exit from the front of the train
and Blacks from the rear.
LIONEL PURDY, tiny, and dressed in a mailman's uniform,
approaches Tom. Of indeterminate age and dubious intellect,
his mail bag is almost as big as he is.
LIONEL
Someone important?
TOM
You might say so, Lionel.
LIONEL
Who?
TOM
A Mr. Roosevelt.
LIONEL
Teddy?
TOM
(patiently)
No, he's dead.
LIONEL
Oh.
The STATIONMASTER approaches.
STATIONMASTER
Tom, your guest needs some
assistance. We're gonna need some
able-bodied men to move him.
TOM
(to Lionel)
Go over to the livery stable...
LIONEL
... and get the Collier boys.

Franklin exits the train slung in a fireman's carry over the
shoulder of ROY COLLIER, African-American, 29. His brother
PETE, 27, is close behind, carrying luggage -- both hover at
around 6' 4".
Tom approaches. Franklin attempts to hide his embarrassment
with good cheer.
FRANKLIN
Hello! Hello! Mr. Loyless?
TOM
Tom, Mr. Roosevelt.
FRANKLIN
Then you'd better call me Franklin.
Still in the fireman's carry, Franklin extends his hand for
Tom to shake.
TOM
Franklin.
FRANKLIN
And this is the Misses.
ELEANOR
Call me Eleanor.
TOM
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Roy then carries him over to Tom's car and gingerly places
him inside. Pete follows.
ROY
(to Tom)
There's a trunk and a chair with
the wheels, too.
TOM
I'll send a wagon right over.
PETE
We got a wagon, sir.
37
37
Tom drives Franklin in front, Eleanor sits in the back.
28.
Pine trees tower over the sides of the dirt road. In
occasional clearings, Franklin spies barefoot children
playing out in front of broken-down shacks. They stop their
play to look at the car.
FRANKLIN
(covering his discomfort)
Beautiful country.
ELEANOR
How long have you been manager of
the Inn?
TOM
Not long.
They BANG over a large pothole. They all fly up and land hard.
FRANKLIN
Got any paved roads?
TOM
No we don't.
38
38
Tom's car turns into a driveway. Franklin has a brochure for
"The Meriwether Inn" opened in his lap. He tries to spy the
building through the trees but cannot.
He looks back at the brochure. The picture is of a lavish
Victorian Hotel and the words, "Our renowned mineral hot
springs can cure whatever ails you!"
Franklin looks up and sees a three-story hideous green and
yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side. Paint is
peeling everywhere. What once were flower beds are overgrown
with weeds.
The car pulls to a stop.
TOM
You'll have a great deal of
privacy. There are only a few
guests right now as it's the off-
season... I'm hoping to make some
improvements by next Spring --
Franklin puts out his arm preventing Tom from getting out of
the car.
F
29.
FRANKLIN
(panicked)
I... I can't stay here. This place
is a wreck.
E
LEANOR
Franklin!
TOM
Look on the bright side. Most of
your time will be spent in the
water.
(a beat)
It's true, we've fallen on some
hard times...
RANKLIN
Hard times? This is a disaster! It
should be condemned!
Tom's southern manners are being put to the test, but he
stays remarkably calm.
TOM
Yes, we've seen better days.
(a beat)
But then I imagine so have you.
Franklin blinks incomprehensibly at Tom and what he has just
said.
TOM
I'm happy to drive you back to the
train station right now, if that's
what you want.
They lock eyes. Franklin wonders if Tom's bluffing, but he
can't tell.
FRANKLIN
(in a low voice)
Fire. I'm frightened of fire. I
can't get out if I'm upstairs.
TOM
We've got options.
39

Tom's car is now parked in front of a group of small
cottages. Roy and Pete's horse drawn wagon is behind it.
30.

Tom and Pete open a set of shutters over the windows of a
tiny cottage.
Franklin and Eleanor sit in the car, watching.

Pete, alone, drives the wagon past the Inn and out onto the
road.
44

Roy wheels Franklin while Tom walks in front of them leading
the way.
OM
Mrs. Roosevelt want to swim?
FRANKLIN
Mrs. Roosevelt doesn't know how.
Franklin takes in the surroundings. Deserted horse stables in
total ruin and tennis courts covered with underbrush mar the
landscape.
45
45
An immense, T-shaped pool rimmed in concrete. The bluish
water is clear and sparkling and a delicate steam rises out
of the warmth.
A
MOTHER, eyeing Franklin approaching in his wheelchair,
comes to the edge of the pool and coaxes her CHILDREN out of
the water.
AUNT SALLY, an ancient, gaunt, African American woman, stands
guard by the edge of the water.
TOM
Mr. Roosevelt, I'd like you to meet
Aunt Sally.
FRANKLIN
Aunt Sally.
AUNT SALLY
Good day, sir. I have towels for you.
32.
Roy wheels Franklin as close to the rim of the pool as
possible. Tom lends his assistance and both he and Roy HOIST
Franklin out of the chair and place him at the edge, letting
his feet dangle in the warm water.
Twisting on his massive arms, Franklin lowers himself cautiously.
TOM
Now give it a minute. You'll see
that the mineralization makes the
water more buoyant. The crippled
boy who swam here was actually able
to walk in the water.
Franklin's legs flop as his useless feet touch the shallow
bottom. Crushed, all hope drains from his face.
FRANKLIN
I can't even stand.
AUNT SALLY
Well, not yet.
46

Roy sleeps on a couch on the front porch. Crickets hum.
50

Pete helps Eleanor into his livery wagon.
Franklin watches from the porch as Eleanor rides away. Her
suitcase slides across the open wagon bed, as the wagon makes
the tight turn from the driveway onto the main road.
ON ELEANOR
Looking out -- straight ahead.
ON FRANKLIN
Alone and scared as he watches the wagon fade from sight.

52
The row of abandoned cottages look strangely pretty, aglow in
the setting sun.
53
53
Franklin is seated on the ramshackle porch in his chair. His
cigarette hangs from his lip as he mixes martinis in a glass
milk bottle. He pours one for Tom, then himself.
FRANKLIN
To your mineral pool, or whatever
you call it.
TOM
Warm Springs.
They clink their glasses. Tom takes a polite sip, then chokes
back the bad taste.
FRANKLIN
Too strong?
TOM
Haven't been in a drinking mood lately.
FRANKLIN
I have.
TOM
Actually, its the most god-awful
martini I've ever tasted.
FRANKLIN
Are you always this direct, Tom?
36.
TOM
Well, I never tasted a martini this
bad before.
Franklin takes another sip, checking. It tastes fine to him.
FRANKLIN
(hurt)
Everyone likes my martinis...
TOM
So they say.
55
55
Aunt Sally is seated, talking with Roy while Franklin lies on
his back in the water, swimming. All his movement comes from
his shoulders and arms. The morning sun streams down on him.
Tom sits off to one side reading the newspaper.
FRANKLIN
Tell me more about what that boy
did, Aunt Sally.
AUNT SALLY
Well, first he'd always swim over
to the side of the pool and hold
himself there -- make sure he
righted himself. Then... before he
knew it... he'd be standing.
FRANKLIN
If it was only that easy.
AUNT SALLY
Well, you make it hard. Get over to
the side of that pool and grab it.
FRANKLIN
(
humoring her)
Yes, ma'am.
AUNT SALLY
Now you got to remember how you did
it.
Franklin holds the edge of the pool, closing his eyes.
F
37.
For a long moment there is silence. Almost without realizing
it, Franklin lets go of the edge of the pool.
When he opens his eyes -- he is standing -- all by himself in
the water.
FRANKLIN
(a nervous laugh)
I'm standing.
His laughter gets stronger. Tom, Aunt Sally and Roy look on.
FRANKLIN
I'm standing.
The release is powerful as Franklin dissolves into tears.
56
56
Tom, who's been mixing cocktails, hands Franklin a drink and
lifts his glass.
TOM
To standing on your own two feet!
They clink and drink.
RANKLIN
This water could be the cure -- the
cure! In six months I could be up
and walking!
Lionel, the mailman, comes down the path carrying a
flashlight, reading an open letter.
LIONEL
Evening folks.
FRANKLIN
Cocktail, Lionel?
LIONEL
I can't. I'm working for the
federal government.
FRANKLIN
All the more reason.
(shoving a drink at him)
Sort of late for the mail, isn't it?
F
L
38.
LIONEL
Not for me it isn't. Got a whole
packet of clippings for you, Mr.
Roosevelt. From a Mr. Howe. New
York Times, Journal-American...
don't know what else.
He hands an already opened letter to Franklin.
LIONEL
Your mother wants to know when
you're coming home. She says they
got swimming pools in Hyde Park.
She's mad as all hell.
FRANKLIN
Reading other people's mail is not
only impolite, it's illegal.
LIONEL
Sheriff don't mind. He likes I read
his mail. Saves him the time. Plus
a lot of folks around here can't
read, so it's more a public
service, really.
FRANKLIN
Astonishing. Thank you, Lionel.
He hands Lionel a letter.
IONEL
(reading)
"Miss Missy LeHand." Who's she?
F
RANKLIN
If you must know, she's my social
secretary.
(to Tom)
I'm having her come down.
Lionel reaches into his bag.
LIONEL
Almost forgot... your wife wrote
the nicest letter. She's gonna make
a speech at the League of Women
Voters.
RANKLIN
Give me that.
(
39.
He hands the letter to Franklin who immediately begins
reading.
LIONEL
(to Tom)
Says she's gonna keep the Roosevelt
name alive. Least till he starts
walkin' and all.
Lionel takes the letter Franklin just handed him, opens it,
flicks his flashlight back on and continues on his way.
FRANKLIN
(studying the letter)
This is so unlike Eleanor. She's
terrified of crowds.
CUT TO:

Franklin is attempting to walk in the water, working
diligently. Tom watches him from a few paces back.
TOM
Morning.
FRANKLIN
I walked five steps today!
TOM
Congratulations. Listen, Franklin,
I got word a local reporter wants
to do a story on you.
RANKLIN
I'm hardly newsworthy these days.
(a beat)
How did he find out I'm here?
TOM
Small town -- word gets out. It
probably won't amount to more than
a provincial puff piece but it
might give us some free publicity
for the Inn.
Franklin looks at Tom knowing full well he's arranged this.
TOM
All right, I know the gentleman.
I'm doing him a favor. You know, I
used to be a journalist.
FRANKLIN
Do you mean all this time I've been
talking to a newspaper man?
42.
TOM
Not anymore. I got in a bit of
trouble in Atlanta. Seems some of
the editorial pieces I wrote
offended the sensibilities of a
local civic group. So I needed to
lay low for a while.
FRANKLIN
(a beat)
You mean the Klan? Good God, Tom...
T
OM
Thankfully, Mr. George Foster
Peabody gave me this job...
FRANKLIN
Well, that explains a few things.
For the life of me, I couldn't
figure out why someone like you was
running this --
TOM
Rat-trap?
FRANKLIN
(laughing, swimming off)
I was going to say dump, but rat-
trap fits nicely.

Franklin is seated -- but not in his wheelchair. He wears
long pants even though it's blisteringly hot.
CLEBURNE GREGORY, 28, sits across from Franklin -- a second
string reporter in a three-piece suit.
GREGORY
Now in 1920 when you were running
for Vice-President...
FRANKLIN
I can't imagine your readers are
interested in ancient history. Cox
and I lost the election by a wide
margin.
GREGORY
It was only a few years ago, Mr.
Roosevelt...
H
43.
FRANKLIN
Now it's the waters extra minerals
plus its warmth that makes all the
difference. At 90 degrees I can
work my muscles for hours and not
get cold.
GREGORY
As Assistant Secretary of the Navy
during the Great War did you
condone the use of...
FRANKLIN
I forgot one more thing you will
need to write down. Poor
circulation is a chronic problem
for people in my condition.
Gregory looks at Franklin. It's clear he's not going to get
the interview he came for.
GREGORY
So... you think it could be a cure?
FRANKLIN
I don't know.
GREGORY
But you're hopeful?
FRANKLIN
Yes. I am.
63
63
A small breeze or a decent rain would knock it to the ground.
It's a cold day and Franklin is swimming in the pool.
Roy is wearing a sweater. Aunt Sally is there, too, wearing a
patched up coat with a scarf around her neck. Tom is nearby
raking leaves.
AUNT SALLY
Mr. Roosevelt, aren't you cold?
OY
Mr. Roosevelt, you're gonna catch
the chill if you don't get out of
the water.
Franklin ignores them and dips under the water as Tom comes
over.
48.
AUNT SALLY
You got to tell him, Mr. Loyless.
He won't listen to us.
Franklin comes up from under.
TOM
Franklin, we need to talk...
Normally we close up this time of
year and the staff goes home for
the holidays.
Franklin looks at Tom, then at Roy and Aunt Sally,
acknowledging.
The sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE is heard.

OM
You're a sight for sore eyes...
FRANKLIN
We missed you at the station...
51.
The smile on Franklin's face slips to a look of shock as he
takes in Tom's changed appearance. His face is sallow and his
trademark white suit is hanging on him.
FRANKLIN
(concerned)
Tom, are you all right?
TOM
It's just an ulcer. I can't eat
anything I like anymore.
Roy carries the luggage into the cottage.
FRANKLIN
(covering)
My father had ulcers. Damn irritating.
TOM
Yes, they are.
A silence hangs in the air.
TOM
Ready to swim?

Franklin now dressed in his bathing suit is being wheeled by
Roy. Tom follows.
TOM
We've got some new guests. Some
paying, some non-paying...
As they get closer, Franklin is stunned by what he sees --
A DOZEN PEOPLE -- all in different groupings -- some on
crutches, others in wheelchairs, are gathered around the
pool.
FRANKLIN
What in blazes?...
TOM
The interview you gave was
syndicated in Sunday papers all
over the country.
Franklin looks up at Tom, dumbfounded.
TOM
They're here to see you.

This news hits Franklin with the force of a sledgehammer.
PAT DOYLE, 50, is stuffed into his wheelchair with a huge
cigar between his fat lips.
is eyebrows have a life of their own. He wheels himself to
Franklin.
PAT
Mr. Roosevelt, Pat Doyle. I've come
all the way from Minneapolis to
shake your hand, sir.
He reaches out his hand to Franklin.
PAT
Stuck in this chair I do nothing
but read. Newspapers, mostly.
Usually I'm just looking for
something -- anything -- that'll
tell me there's even the slightest
chance I'll walk again.
Franklin is uncomfortable, especially as Pat won't let go of
his hand.
FRANKLIN
I really don't know what to say.
PAT
Well, you're here. And we're here.
Together... we'll think of
something.
Franklin looks to Tom and gestures for him to come closer.
FRANKLIN
(whispering)
Get me out of here.

Franklin is pushing the chair himself along the dirt path,
his anger propelling F
him away from Tom.
RANKLIN
I want no part of this. I come here
for privacy!
TOM
This isn't your personal spa!
I have a business to run.
53.
FRANKLIN
Exactly. You have a business to
run, not I!
TOM
No one's asking anything of you!
FRANKLIN
Of course they are!
TOM
Do you know what it took for most
of them to get here?
FRANKLIN
It's not my concern. I want to be
left alone!
TOM
My God, you're afraid of these people.
FRANKLIN
Afraid? What you're talking about?
TOM
You look at them with the same
repulsion and pity as everyone else.
FRANKLIN
Don't be ridiculous. I resent your
trying to --
TOM
You don't want to be around them
because then that would make you
one of them, wouldn't it?
Franklin furiously wheels himself back towards the cottage,
getting stuck on the dirt path along the way.
FRANKLIN
God damn it!
Tom comes to his aid but he is brushed off by Franklin.
FRANKLIN
Out of my way! Get out of my
goddamn way!
Franklin wheels himself off.
54.

Franklin, in his wheelchair, smokes a cigarette. His bags are
next to him, as is Roy. A train's whistle BLOWS and pulls in.
ROY
Right on time.
Franklin sees someone else on the platform. He squints in the
distance. It's Tom.
He walks closer towards Franklin and Roy.
TOM
Good evening.
Franklin nods in Tom's general direction. Tom has a telegram
in his hand which peaks Franklin's curiosity.
FRANKLIN
Expecting someone?
TOM
Yes.
The train comes to a complete stop. A CONDUCTOR steps out
onto the platform. A single ELDERLY WOMAN gets off the train.
TOM
(to the Conductor)
I'm looking for a young gentleman
by the name of Botts. Fred Botts?
CONDUCTOR
Don't know anything about that.
TOM
I expect he would be in a
wheelchair.
CONDUCTOR
You mean the cripple? He's in the
baggage car.
73

Tom, Franklin and Roy are in front of the large door as the
Conductor pushes it back slowly.
55.
Roy lays Fred on a bench. Franklin wheels himself over.
FRANKLIN
Son, can you hear me?
Tom brings a cup of water. Franklin puts it to Fred's lips.
FRANKLIN
Fred?
Fred opens his eyes. They are large and brown with a
sweetness to them. His face comes alive when he recognizes
Franklin.
FRED
Mr. Roosevelt?...
FRANKLIN
It's going to be all right, son.
H
e hands Franklin a worn newspaper clipping from his pocket.
The headline reads: "FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY TO HEALTH!"
FRED
The conductor wouldn't let me ride
in the passenger car with my chair.
Franklin looks at the clipping, then at Fred.
FRANKLIN
When did you last eat?
FRED
Knoxville.
56.
TOM
Knoxville had to be three days ago.
FRANKLIN
Roy, take him to the car.
As Roy lifts Fred in his arms, Franklin wheels himself to the
engine car. Tom follows as they approach the CONDUCTOR.
FRANKLIN
Who in their right mind let's a
child ride in the baggage car!
You could have killed that boy.
CONDUCTOR
He had polio. Probably still
contagious.
The Conductor walks away, dismissively. Franklin pushes his
chair up and stops the Conductor in his tracks.
FRANKLIN
Don't dismiss me because I sit in
this chair!
CONDUCTOR
Get away from me.
Franklin pushes the wheels of his chair with such force he
knocks the Conductor over.
FRANKLIN
You ignorant son of a bitch. If I
could, I'd get up right now and
lock you in that box car! See how
you like it!
TOM
Franklin...
The Conductor struggles to get up.
CONDUCTOR
Get this lunatic off me!
Franklin wheels himself towards Tom's car where Fred is now
lying across the back seat. The sight of Fred drains all
anger from Franklin's face.
FRANKLIN
Where's the nearest hospital?
57.
TOM
Atlanta.
FRANKLIN
What about a doctor?
TOM
Closer, but not by much.
The train whistle BLOWS.
ROY
Train's ready.
Franklin looks at Fred, then at Roy and Tom.
FRANKLIN
(quietly)
Let's go home.

Franklin is in the pool with the new guests. They are all
nervously waiting to test the water.
From the looks on their faces it's clear they only want to
take their cues from Franklin.
A MOTHER carries her adorable 4 year old GIRL into the water.
FRANKLIN
And who is this delightful child?
DAISY
(giggling)
Daisy.
FRANKLIN
All right Daisy, try and kick your legs.
Daisy wiggles back and forth in her MOTHER's arms giving it
her very best effort.
FRANKLIN
Excellent, Daisy!
JAKE PERRINI, 32, Bronx-born with an upper body of steel
wheels over to Roy who is fixing a wheelchair.
JAKE
Jake Perrini, Bronx, New York.
ROY
Roy, sir.
JAKE
How you doin'?
Jake reaches out his hand to shake. Roy is unsure what to do.
JAKE
C'mon -- I won't bite.
T
61.
ROY
(shaking his hand)
Mighty fine, sir. Mighty fine.
JAKE
Hey, would you mind pulling me
outta this trap, Roy? I wanna get
airborne.
Roy gently lifts Jake up and out of his chair, into his arms
like a child.
JAKE
Do me one more favor? Throw me in?
Roy tosses Jake to the heavens and he SAILS through the air
emitting a jungle cry of pure emotional release before
SPLASHING down hard in the water.
H
e bobs up to the surface. There is applause.
FRANKLIN
Now folks, these exercises are of
my own devising so bear with me.
Some laugh, some are confused. This is new territory for
everyone.
FRANKLIN
My hope is that in repeating these
movements over and over in the
water I'm in some way causing the
muscles to regenerate themselves
and repair the damage.
He swims to the edge of the pool.
FRANKLIN
So everybody grab the edge of the
pool and move what you can!
hey disperse, eagerly ready to do what Franklin tells them.
FRANKLIN
Go ahead now, do your best!
Their legs barely rise up to splash the surface. Undeterred,
Franklin leads them on, spiritedly.
In the distance we see Tom, leaning against a tree, watching
everything.

With Louis in tow, Eleanor is touring the exterior of an
ironworks factory. She is the only woman in a large gathering

It would be overwhelming if not for
my deep belief that help is
possible..."

Franklin is in the water. Roy lifts Fred out of his
wheelchair and gently puts him in the shallow end. Franklin
receives him. Fred's face is ecstatic as he floats on his
back in the water.
ELEANOR (V.O.)
"I hope you are finding your work
to be gratifying in both mind and
heart. Your beloved, Eleanor."

A very old car comes coughing in, steam hissing from its
engine.
HELENA MAHONEY, 43, gets out of the driver's seat. Her iron
will is matched only by her deep reserves of empathy. She
gets a good look at the Inn. This is what she has come for?

Franklin and Roy, having finished lunch, are playing
checkers. Fred is sitting nearby eating a piece of pie.
Helena approaches. Roy pulls off a triple jump.
64.
FRANKLIN
Damn!
ROY
King me.
Franklin reluctantly tops Roy's checker.
FRED
You're losing, Doc.
HELENA
Doc? I'm sorry, you're Franklin
Roosevelt, aren't you?
FRANKLIN
Depends.
(suspiciously)
Are you a lawyer?
HELENA
No.
FRANKLIN
Then Roosevelt it is. Wait!
He jumps one of Roy's checkers.
HELENA
I'm Helena Mahoney. I'm a physical
therapist.
(off their blank looks)
You have no idea who I am, do you?
FRANKLIN
Should I?
HELENA
I wrote you a letter right after I
saw the article in the paper.
Didn't you read it?
FRANKLIN
It got read, I assure you. But
probably not by me.
Helena glances down at the checkerboard and points to it.
HELENA
(to Roy)
He's open right there.
65.
ROY
He sure is.
Roy trounces Franklin with three swift moves.
ROY
Thank you, ma'am.
Helena sits at the table with them.
HELENA
I've been studying the effects of
moist heat on polio patients and I
think with repeated exercise in
warm water...
FRANKLIN
It can help them regain lost
strength.
HELENA
Yes.
FRANKLIN
Incredibly I've come to the same
conclusion myself.
HELENA
(a half-smile)
Well, you're the doctor.

Helena is wheeling Franklin around the grounds.
HELENA
No ramps, no running water, no
doctors... from the article in the

There's a need for a place like

67.
Are you aware NKLIN(cont'd)
FRA that in the last
epidemic over 16,000 people got
polio in the New York area alone?
TOM
Sounds like you've been reading up.
FRANKLIN
I wish there was more to read. Damn
few things being written about any
of this. To think of someone like
Fred... locked away... his mind and
heart so vibrant...
TOM
It's a waste. An awful waste.
Franklin takes a beat -- the weight of this sinking in.
FRANKLIN
What's the acreage here?
TOM
Roughly twelve hundred or so. Why?
FRANKLIN
I want to buy it. I think it would
make one hell of an investment.
TOM
Investment?
FRANKLIN
Twelve hundred acres? Enough for
two resorts, don't you think?
TOM
It would take money. There's a lot
of land, rebuilding the inn, adding
ramps and so many people can't pay...
FRANKLIN
(undeterred)
Do you think old Peabody will sell?
TOM
He'll sell.
FRANKLIN
How can you be so sure?
TOM
Have you taken a look at this
place?

Helena is training a group of YOUNG MEN how to lift and carry
using a raven haired young woman, ELOISE HUTCHISON, 18, as
the test model. She sits shyly in her wheelchair before them.
HELENA
Woodhall, this is Eloise. Lift her
gently.
WOODHALL BUSEY, 17, has bright red hair and a face full of
freckles. Over six feet tall he has spent his life working in
the fields.
W
OODHALL
Yes, ma'am.
He picks Eloise up effortlessly, then sets her back down.
HELENA
Very good! Watch her braces.
Woodhall kneels before Eloise like Prince Charming, carefully
straightening out her legs.
WOODHALL
You're light as a ...
He notices the long jagged scars along Eloise's wrists.
Eloise, sensing his eyes, self-consciously pulls down her
sleeves. He stares at her questioningly.
ELOISE
(looking away)
I was a dancer...
Tom and Franklin come out. Franklin gives a questioning look
to Helena, pondering how these boys have suddenly appeared.
T
69.
HELENA
Good news... I raided the pool
hall. I call them my Push Boys.
FRANKLIN
Welcome Push Boys! Good day, Eloise.
ELOISE
Hello, Mr. Roosevelt.
TOM
Want to tell them your good news?
Franklin is smiling like the cat that ate the canary.
FRANKLIN
It's hardly a done deal, but for
better or worse, you may be looking
at the new owner of this God-
forsaken place.
96

The sun is about to rise. Tom's car is parked in front of the
Inn, pulled up very close to the main entrance. The trunk is
open.
71.
Tom, struggling with a suitcase, comes down the ramp. He
deposits it in the trunk and then walks precariously back up
the ramp, having difficulty navigating the incline.
He goes back into the house for one last bag. When he comes
out, he's surprised by what he sees --
FRANKLIN (O.S.)
Where do you think you're going?
Franklin is being pushed by Roy in his wheelchair. They are
both dressed in pajamas and bathrobes, though Franklin has a
blanket around his shoulders to shield him from the morning
chill.
Tom is caught. This is everything he wanted to avoid.
TOM
Going to Asheville to see my
parents.
From the sight of Tom's car stuffed with luggage, it is clear
he is not coming back.
FRANKLIN
I can't do this without you...
we're only just beginning.
TOM
You. (You're beginning, not me.
a beat)
I've got cancer, Franklin. It's
spread everywhere.
Franklin is stunned -- utterly thrown.
FRANKLIN
I... I'll take you to the best doctors.
We'll go to Atlanta right now --
TOM
I've seen the best doctors. When
you were in New York they opened me
up for the second time. Now I just
want to die in the bed I was born.
Franklin is struggling with this.
TOM
You're going to do great things.
This place has an identity now --
a purpose. It has you.
72.
Any guard Franklin had is gone. He reaches out and takes Tom
by the sleeve slipping his hand into Tom's gripping it tightly.
TOM
Take care of yourself, Roy.
ROY
God be with you, Mr. Loyless.
Tom takes one last look at Franklin.
FRANKLIN
You never pitied me. Thank you for that.
TOM
On the contrary, I envy you.
FRANKLIN
I will miss you all the days of my
life.
Tom gets into his car and looks at Franklin with a smile.
TOM
Good luck, Franklin.
With a wave he slowly lurches down the long driveway and
turns onto the main road. Franklin watches the car until it
is out of sight.

Fred, on crutches, swings himself up using one side and then
the next under Helena's supervision.
74.
HELENA
Excellent, Fred! Keep going...
They are surrounded by many others, Franklin, Eloise,
Woodhall, Pat and Jake.
The BEEPING of a car horn gets their immediate attention.
Roy leaps off the porch, skipping the stairs as his brother
Pete drives up in Tom's car. He parks it and steps out.
PETE
Morning, Mr. Roosevelt.
FRANKLIN
Peter, what are you doing with
Tom's car?
PETE
I was as sorry as anyone to hear
about Mr. Loyless's passing. Wished
he coulda' lived to see this!
FRANKLIN
What are you talking about?
PETE
Mr. Loyless had me come up and
fetch this right after he brung it
to Asheville. "Pete, he said, "Take
this home and fix it up for Mr.
Roosevelt."
FRANKLIN
Pete... I can't drive a car.
PETE
You can now.
Roy opens the passenger door and lifts Franklin into the
driver's seat.
PETE
Get on in and I'll teach ya'!
He begins showing off a system of pulleys and levers that
have been attached to both pedals. They thread through holes
in a second dashboard, attached to polished wood knobs.
It's a hand-controlled automobile.
PETE
That one there is your brake.
75.
FRANKLIN
Got it.
PETE
And this here's the gas.
FRED
Hot damn! You got hand controls.
PAT
That is a thing of beauty!
Franklin begins running his hands over the polished wood knobs.
PETE
Now you got to push it real smooth
or it goes all herky-jerky.
Franklin excitedly turns the key and starts it up.
PETE
Wait, Mr. Roosevelt, you're not
ready to drive yet!
FRANKLIN
Oh, yes I am!
Franklin hits the gas as the car begins HALTING and JERKING
the whole way down the driveway. Pete is yelling out
instructions but Franklin ignores him.
They all watch as he pulls away.
As the car hits the end of the driveway Franklin reaches
across Pete and opens his passenger door pushing him out.
Franklin tears off alone -- out on his first solo spin.

A spent and anxious Eleanor, with Louis in tow, stands on the
station platform, suitcase in hand.
76.
LOUIS
It's a far cry from Grand Central
Station.
They are both silent for a moment.
ELEANOR
The wire said someone would be here
to pick us up.
The sounds of tires screeching and a car horn cause them to
turn around.
It is Franklin, sitting in the driver's seat of his car.
FRANKLIN
Your chariot awaits, Madame!
Louis promptly drops the luggage. Then he and Eleanor walk
over to the car, taking in the hand-controls.
LOUIS
When did you learn to drive this
thing?
FRANKLIN
Tuesday!
101

Franklin drives wild and fast. Louis hat flies right off his
head. Eleanor just holds on.
102
102
Franklin, Eleanor and Louis pull up to the Inn. Though the
brush has been cleared and the trees are newly trimmed, it's
still a wreck. Franklin is too proud to concede Louis and
Eleanor's disappointment.
FRANKLIN
Can't wait to give you the tour!
103
103
Franklin wheels himself along the circular driveway, pointing
things out, almost manic in his energy.
FRANKLIN
A small schoolhouse will go there.
We need it badly as many of the
children are barred from the local
schools due to their infirmities.
77.
He points to a dilapidated gardener's shed.
FRANKLIN
We also require a blacksmith's shop
so we can craft braces here on the
premises. I've found a wonderful
local man who can make crutches and
canes. His work is outstanding. Of
course what is most desperately
needed is a hospital. That's going
to put my fund raising abilities to
the test.
Franklin wheels himself up a ramp to the Inn as Eleanor and
Louis follow.
105
105
Eleanor approaches the pool. It is as quiet as a church. She
is stunned to observe over a dozen tables set up in the
water.
On each table is a child or an adult polio wearing their
bathing suit. Next to them is a Physical Therapist also in
bathing attire conducting therapy. In hushed tones the
Physical Therapists encourage and work the distressed limbs
of the patients as Helena swims to each table overseeing the
work being done.
Eleanor sits down in a chair and watches fascinated.
108

Franklin's car pulls up to a massive stone building built in
Greek revival style. Franklin looks intimidated -- there are
two dozen stairs leading up to the main entrance.
109
109
Roy climbs the stairs like a stevedore with Franklin slung
over his shoulder. Using enormous force, Eleanor is pulling
the chair up and over each step while walking backwards up
the stairs.
112
112
Roy is fast asleep tucked around the wheelchair in the back
seat.
Franklin smiles in Eleanor's direction. She looks back at him
shyly and smiles in return. But her expression changes when
she sees something in his eyes -- something she hasn't seen
for a long time.
ELEANOR
What is it?
FRANKLIN
(a beat)
Who are you?
Franklin reaches out and takes her hand, pulling her close.
He stretches his whole arm around her and places her hand on
one of the driving knobs, his hand on top of hers.
ELEANOR
I don't know how to drive.
FRANKLIN
I'll teach you.
They operate the car together -- their connection complete.
113

Franklin and Eleanor are sitting in the front seat of the
car. Louis is already up on the train platform.
ELEANOR
I'll break the news to Mama.
Franklin smiles as they look at each other like two naughty
children.
ELEANOR
I think it's going to be fun.
Eleanor bursts out laughing, Franklin joins in.
F
89.
FRANKLIN
Babs... words fail me.
ELEANOR
You? Franklin Roosevelt?
She leans in and kisses Franklin on the mouth.
ELEANOR
I do so love you.
She slides out of the car and goes up to the platform and
A
boards the train while Franklin watches her.
Farmer and his Wife from the school house graduation
approach Franklin.
ARMER
Mr. Roosevelt you lookin' mighty fit.
FARMER'S WIFE
Fine day, isn't it.
FRANKLIN
It is. How's the Boll Weevil
situation?
FARMER'S WIFE
I expect the Boll Weevil is always
gonna be a situation, Mr.
Roosevelt, but thanks for askin'.
Franklin's energy and vitality are infectious. The politician
within him is being reborn.

On a blanket nearby are Jake and Mary Beth.
he unbuttons his shirt and runs her hands over his
impressively developed upper body. They begin to kiss
hungrily, passionately -- completely in their own world.
Several yards away, across the lawn, Eloise is in
Woodhall's arms -- they are dancing. He is singing softly
into her ear as they sway, her feet never touching the ground.
NT. MERIWETHER INN - NIGHT
Helena, in a nightgown, is looking out a window into the
distance. Fiercely protective and slightly envious of her
charges, she pulls a pack of cigarettes from her bathrobe
pocket and steals a solitary smoke.

Franklin seated alone on the porch in the darkness. He drags
on his cigarette and the red glow illuminates the contours of
his face in repose.
FADE OUT:

Franklin is walking on crutches aided by Roy. Nearby, a group
of children practice on parallel bars with Helena.
FRANKLIN
What am I going to tell these people
if I have to close things down?
ROY
That you did the best you could.
Franklin gives Roy a look of gratitude, then notices Lionel
approaching with his mail bag.
Lionel hands Franklin a fistful of open envelopes.
FRANKLIN
Any good news?
LIONEL
Creditors are gettin' cranky.
FRANKLIN
The operative word was good.
LIONEL
Oh, yah, almost forgot. The doctor
that came and studied ya'll sent
his report.
93.
Lionel offers up the envelope, but then pulls it back before
handing it over.
LIONEL
Save me the stamps?
Franklin nods then grabs it from Lionel. He rips it open and
begins devouring the report.
FRANKLIN
(reading)
"... therefore, in conclusion, my
research has shown that the
overwhelming majority of patients
here have shown some improvement.
Enough for me to recommend warm
water therapy as the standard post
polio treatment to the Orthopedics
Society of America!"
(
he grips Roy's arm)
Roy!
Something catches Franklin's eye and his smile begins to fade.
ROY
What is it, sir?
126

Waiting on the porch are Eleanor and Helena, who are seated,
talking. Louis exits the cottage, defeated.
LOUIS
Your turn.
Eleanor rises and goes into the cottage as Louis takes her
seat next to Helena.

Franklin is wheeled down to the pool by Roy and Eleanor. When
they get closer, Franklin makes out someone already swimming.
ELLIOT
Hi, Pop!
FRANKLIN
(squinting)
Who's that?
ELLIOT ROOSEVELT is now 17 years old. He has his mother's
enormous blue eyes and his father's natural charisma.
FRANKLIN
Elliot!
LLIOT
Come on! You getting in?
Louis and Helena approach the pool.
FRANKLIN
I sense a conspiracy.
LOUIS
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
ranklin smiles, warily.
129

Elliot is climbing a rope dangling high from a tree as
Franklin and Eleanor look up at him. Franklin is standing on
crutches.
Elliot descends with a flourish as Helena approaches Franklin
with a single cane.
HELENA
Franklin, let go of your crutches.
You're not going to need them.
100.
FRANKLIN
What?
HELENA
We're going to make your arms
function as your legs.
FRANKLIN
How is that possible?
HELENA
Elliot, go to your father and stand
on his left side.
ELLIOT
Think this may work, Pop.
HELENA
Eleanor, take the crutch.
Eleanor takes one crutch as Helena takes the other, replacing
it in Franklin's hand with a cane.
Then, with Elliot on Franklin's left side she bends Elliot's
arm at a right angle, like a parallel bar, and hooks
Franklin's left arm around his.
Going over to Franklin's right side she puts a cane in his hand.
HELENA
(to Franklin)
Now use your right shoulder and
pull your left leg forward.
He does so.
HELENA
Good! Now with the muscles in your
left shoulder, pull your right leg.
FRANKLIN
One small bump and I'll land right
on my keister!
HELENA
That's what Elliot is for. He's
going to hold you up. Hitch your
leg! Come on!
Franklin and Elliot attempt to walk. It requires immense
strength and effort on both their parts.
101.
HELENA
(ever the taskmaster)
Elliot, don't lean in -- stand up
straight. Pull against him. He
needs you!
After one or two steps the enormity of it overwhelms Franklin.
FRANKLIN
I can't.
ELLIOT
I'm strong, pop. You can't hurt me.
HELENA
You can do this, Franklin! Keep
going!
They start the walk again. It's awkward... difficult... but
it's working.
LOUIS
(under his breath)
I'll be damned.
Franklin stops, exhausted.
ELEANOR
Franklin, are you all right?
FRANKLIN
I'm fine. I'm just...
Roy runs in with a chair and helps Franklin into it as
Helena, Eleanor, Louis, Elliot and Roy all look at him,
concerned.
HELENA
This isn't a replacement for the real
work we're doing to get you on your
feet again, understand? No one is
throwing in the towel or even agreeing
with that doctor's report...
FRANKLIN
I know, I know.
HELENA
I know it's not practical --

FRANKLIN
No, it's not.

It's political.
Franklin looks at Louis, then to Eleanor, and realizes that
this could be it.

Franklin and Elliot are walking. Helena is close behind,
coaching.
ELENA
Use Elliot, not the cane. Switch
your weight to Elliot... good! Keep
your head up.
Off to the side Pat, Jake, Eloise, Woodhall and Daisy are
having an informal picnic, observing Franklin.
ELOISE
Why is he working so hard to hide it?
JAKE
He doesn't have a choice.
ELOISE
Oh, I disagree.
JAKE
How can you disagree? "There but
for the grace of God goes us,"
that's what they're saying. As if
our bodies is who we are, but it's
not. It's our souls is who we are,
but they don't know that.
ELOISE
I wish he could just wheel himself
out there in front of everybody.
PAT
He can't do that Eloise, it's
politics.
JAKE
It's not gonna matter if he hides
his legs as long as he don't hide
what he knows. And what he knows is
what it's like to be one of us.
ranklin, getting closer, raises his cane in greeting.
103.
FRANKLIN
Good afternoon, everyone!
Off-balance Franklin goes down hard bringing Elliot down with
him.
Eleanor, Louis and Roy all rush to his aid, but Helena is
there first.
HELENA
Take a moment to catch your breath...
FRANKLIN
Damn. You okay son?
ELLIOT
I'm fine, Pop.
DAISY
You fell down.
FRANKLIN
Yes, I did, Daisy. Twelfth time
today. Must be a new record!
Daisy laughs as do the others, though some can't hide their
concern.
Franklin struggles hard as Roy and Elliot help him to his
feet.
131
131
Franklin is settling into the driver's seat of his car, aided
by Roy. Eleanor is seated next to him; Louis and Elliot in
back.
Franklin's attention is diverted by something he sees
straight ahead.
It is the entire Warm Springs group coming down the driveway
in chairs and on crutches.
All the patients, the Push Boys, the physical therapists,
Helena, Jake, Fred, Aunt Sally, Eloise and Lionel.
FRED
Don't worry, Doc -- we're not
coming with you.
F
105.
FRANKLIN
Oh, you'll be with me. No question
of that.
(a beat)
I am proud more than you will ever
know to be part of this community.
(his voice growing
stronger)
A community based not on birthright
or privilege, but on compassion and
courage. The true power of these
waters is that they brought us all
together. Our ability to help one
another is what will make our
victory over polio endure. Our
ability to survive... despite the
odds.
F
ranklin looks out at the sea of faces.
FRANKLIN
What we have done and will continue
to do until this disease is
defeated is come together -- like a
family -- and do what we do best...
(his voice breaking)
Lift each other up.
Franklin starts the car as the crowd begins to disperse.
Then, spying Helena, Franklin calls out to her.
FRANKLIN
Miss Mahoney I need to speak with
you, please.
HELENA
Sure, Doc.
Off her smile, Franklin reaches into his pocket and withdraws
a small box.
FRANKLIN
Thank you.
He hands it to Helena. She just stares at it, at a loss for
words.
RANKLIN
Open it.
She does so, tentatively, revealing a ladies watch.
106.
HELENA
It's beautiful.
FRANKLIN
Don't wear it in the pool.
HELENA
I'll try not to. Good luck,
Franklin.
FRANKLIN
I'm throwing myself to the wolves.
HELENA
You've faced worse. And if they
bite, you can come back here.
FRANKLIN
I'll always come back here.
Helena steps away and Franklin pulls out and down the
driveway.

The mineral springs gently ripple as Franklin appears in the

slowly and confidently swims out of frame.
CRAWL
Four years later, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected
President of the United States. He was elected three more
times -- unprecedented in U.S. History.
During his years as President, he saw the country through the
Great Depression and a world war waged on six continents.
On April 12, 1945, in the thirteenth year of his presidency,
at the age of sixty-three, Franklin Roosevelt died in his
cottage at Warm Springs.
The beneficiary of his $562,000 life insurance policy was
Warm Springs... which continues to flourish as a
rehabilitation center to this day.
