  INT. BULLPEN - JAKE S DESK - MORNING (D2)A1RA1R

  JAKE rushes in to find HOLT sitting at his desk.

                              HOLT
                You re three minutes late, Peralta.

                              JAKE
                Not my fault.  I had a plumbing problem.

  INT. JAKE S APARTMENT - EARLIER - FLASHBACK (D2)A2RA2R

  Jake s alarm goes off.  Groggy, he feels for his phone, then 
  chucks it towards the bathroom.  It lands in the toilet.

  INT. BULLPEN - BACK TO SCENE (D2)A3RA3R

                              JAKE
                Which reminds me, I need a new, 
                  departmentally-issued phone.
                      (off Holt s death stare)
                C mon, really?  I m a few minutes late so 
                you call me out in front of everyone?

                              HOLT
                Good idea. 
                      (calls out)
                  Everyone?  Gather around, so I can call 
                out Detective Peralta in front of you.

  They all do.

                              JAKE
                Fine, I was three minutes late, everyone.  
                I m sorry I did one thing wrong.

                              HOLT
                It s more than one thing.  

  He picks up a thick pile of documents from the floor. 

                              JAKE
                Uh-oh.

                              JAKE
                Amazing solve.  I got him to confess in 
                20 minutes.

                              HOLT
                You also mislabeled the evidence.  That 
                  confession would ve been worthless if the 
                Sergeant hadn t caught your mistake.  
                Here are three cases with sloppy 
                  paperwork.  Here are two pictures:

                              HOLT (CONT'D)
                One is your locker, one is a garbage dump 
                in the Philippines.  Can you tell which 
                is which? 

                              JAKE
                ...That one is the dump.

                              HOLT
                They re both your locker.

                              JAKE
                Gahhh, I should have guessed that.  Come 
                on, you re acting like I m some kind of 
                animal.

  Holt picks up a FILE off his desk with UNDERPANTS in it.

                              HOLT
                This folder is labeled  undies-comma-
                dirty.  

                              JAKE
                Would you prefer I wore them?  That s 
                  disgusting, Captain.  Also: who cares 
                about any of this?  I have more felony 
                arrests than any other detective.

                              HOLT
                And you have more mice living in your 
                desk than any other detective.

  He opens a drawer to reveal a MOUSE, milling around.

                              JAKE
                  Algernon!  Algernon s back, you guys!

                              HOLT
                Get rid of that mouse.  And get your act 
                  together.  Now.BROOKLYN NINE-NINE  "The Tagger"   Yellow Collated Reshoot Draft   2A.

                dealer s apartment.

                Oh -- that s what he was drawing.  But

                Look at this.  The drug dealer got a BA 
                in Art History from Brooklyn College.  
                  Interesting, huh?

                              ROSA
                How is that interesting?

                              CHARLES
                Well, it s surprising, because you would 
                think he had studied... drugs.

                              AMY
                  I studied art history, too.

                              ROSA
                Also not interesting.

  Amy shrugs.  Gina walks in with a WOMAN (CARLENE, 30s).

                              GINA
                Excuse me, I couldn t help but overhear 
                that you re looking for some missing 
                drugs that you cannot find.  It just so 
                happens my friend, Carlene, is a psychic

                              GINA
                What?!  She s the real deal.  E-G, last

                guy named Mark and I did.

  points to one and motions: get over here.

                She has had visions that, frankly, 
                science cannot account for.  Also, she 
                can get you amazing deals on ladies  
                  footwear.  She s an assistant manager at 
                  Leonard s Designer Shoes.

                I m slightly interested in the Leonard s 
                Designer Shoes aspect.  Everything else 
                is nonsense.

                              GINA
                Just know that without her help you re 
                totally going to fail and probs get shot

                Holt s coming along on my stakeout?  I 
                made a play-list with some very explicit 
                rap, and now I can t sing along.

                What s insane is that you refuse to get 
                with the program.  There s a new sheriff

                Here are my options: one, I process 
                  Podolski s kid, he ruins my career, I 
                spend the rest of my life as a Detective, 
                3rd grade, which is literally pathetic --

                when I picture spending the rest of my 
                life with a babysitter, she s a really 
                cute blonde named Erica.  She always has

                The point is, Holt cares more about me 
                 doing my job right  than whether I even 
                have a job at all. What should I do?

                Thanks to an unfortunate deal I made 
                earlier today, I assure you, that s not 
                  possible.

                                DEPUTY COMMISSIONER PODOLSKI
                You might not understand this, but Trevor

  Jake holds up his REPORT.  Podolski snatches it from him.

                Oh, thank you, I ll get right to it.

                Carlene was wrong, Gina.  Rosa said it 
                herself: I m in charge of my own destiny.  
                That means she wants me to make a move. 

                              GINA
                But Carlene was also right: you did get 
                 hurt , Rosa punched you.  And the fact 
                that she punched you proves she doesn't 
                like you.  

                              CHARLES
                No, she punched me to prove Carlene 
                wrong.  It was a love punch.

                              GINA
                No, she punched you to hurt your body.  
                It was a punch-punch.  

  Rosa storms past.

                              ROSA
                Move. 

  Charles steps aside, just as she almost runs him over.

                              GINA
                Yeah, I m getting crazy sex vibes.

  We HEAR a WATCH ALARM go off.
