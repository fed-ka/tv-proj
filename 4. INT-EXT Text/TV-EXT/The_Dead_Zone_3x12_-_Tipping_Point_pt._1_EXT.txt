                        I just got a little dizzy that's
                        all...



          As they head back to the car, Rebecca has to catch up with
          Johnny, who seems like he can't get out of there fast
          enough.

                        ...It's not an option.  Not for
                        me.  Not now.

                        You heard Doctor Jaeger, these
                          headaches and blackouts are going
                        to get worse.  You could die.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll have to take my chances.

                                        REBECCA
                          I understand why you wouldn't
                        want to lose your gift, but...
                        Johnny please stop so I can talk
                        to you...

          Johnny stops.  He doesn't want to hear what she has to say
          because he knows she's going to be right.

                                        REBECCA
                        What's happening between us, it's
                        great, but it's just beginning... 
                        and I can't tell you what to do
                        here.  Please, talk to your
                          friends, to people you trust. 
                        Talk to Sarah.  In the meantime
                        let Dr. Jaeger run the tests he
                        needs to do... at least then you'll
                        be basing your decision on all
                        the information.

          Johnny looks at her and relents.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll go through the testing, but
                        I can't promise anything beyond
                        that.

                                        REBECCA
                        Thank you...

          And they continue on to the car.



          WALT leads Johnny and Rebecca through the rows of cars
          until they arrive at Rachel's station wagon.

                        Didn't you already touch her car?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not the inside.  The initial vision
                        I got from the door handle led us
                        to the camera.  By then I was a
                          suspect.

          Johnny opens the driver's door and sits down, but refrains
          from touching the steering wheel.  Rebecca opens the
            passenger door and sits next to him.

          Johnny grips the steering wheel, triggering:


  1515VISION - SPLIT REALITY

            INTERCUTTING: Johnny and Rebecca in the parked car in
            daylight; with Johnny (as the killer) and RACHEL in the
            passenger seat, the night of Rachel's murder.  (The car is
          pulled off the highway.)

                                        REBECCA
                        What is it?  What do you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Rachel... it must be the night of
                        the murder...

          Johnny is behind the wheel as the killer.  Rachel, having
          just been kidnapped from her office and knocked out,
          suddenly awakens, terrified, and begins to put up a fight. 
          Johnny, as the killer, pulls off his ski mask.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (as the killer)
                        What did you tell him?

          Rebecca is startled by the sudden change in Johnny's
            demeanor.

                                        REBECCA

                        What did you tell Smith about us?

                                        RACHEL
                          Nothing.  Nothing I swear.  Please
                        don't hurt me.  Don't hurt me.

          Her hand finds the camera on the seat next to her and she
            instinctually fights for her life, bashing Johnny (the
          killer) repeatedly with the camera.  She kicks at Johnny,
            struggles to open the door, and tumbles out of the car. 
          As Johnny (the killer) takes his hands off the wheel to
          pursue her, THE VISION ENDS.



            Pristine.  New England dunes.  We find Johnny.  Alone. 
          Lying on his back in the sand, wearing sweats and a t-shirt.

                        Can you feel the warm sand Johnny?

          Dressed in a bikini, Rebecca appears sitting on the sand
          next to Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually all I feel is cold

          Johnny and Sarah walk along a tree covered street.

                        They really think they know what
                        causes your visions?

                        This Doctor Jaeger has a theory,
                        but that's all it is, a theory.

                        And you could actually see it?

                        He thinks my "dead zone" is some
                        kind of anomaly deep inside my
                        brain.  It's the source of my
                          visions.  It's also the source of
                        my headaches and blackouts.

                        Listen, Sarah... there's something

                        If something happened... and I
                        wound up in the hospital... if
                        I'm not able to, I want you to be
                        the one to decide whether to
                          operate.

          Sarah lets that soak in.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        I know it's a lot to ask...

                        Of course I'll be there for you. 
                          Whatever you need, always.  We're

                        if it ever comes to it -- don't
                        leave me in another coma.  Pull
                        the plug... promise me...

          She nods yes, and silently mouths "promise", unable to

            Establishing.



          Two young blonde girls, ten and five years old, playing on
          swings, rising and falling out of frame in slow motion. 
          Happy.  Laughing.  Rebecca and Rachel in happier times. 
          Each in turn dip out of frame, only to rise back up as
          their older selves, still happy in a perfect world.  Rebecca
          in particular seems happy in a way we've never seen her,
          because she's with her sister.  She throws her head back
          and laughs, swinging up with all her might as Rachel swings
          past disappearing out of frame.  But when Rebecca reaches
          her apex and begins her descent, her expression changes,
            something suddenly very wrong.  Where Rachel was a second
          ago, now only an empty swing remains, arcing past Rebecca
          on her way down.
