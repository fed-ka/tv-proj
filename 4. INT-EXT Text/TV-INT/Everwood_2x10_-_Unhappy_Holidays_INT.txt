 
     Quiet.  Empty.  The front door opens and ANDY pokes his head 
     in, a mischievous look on his face. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Hello?  Anyone home? 
                   (nothing) 
               Delia...?  Ephram...? 
 
     Confident he's alone, Andy enters, carrying shopping bags. 
     Big ones.  The kind with handles...  And presents inside! 
 
                         NARRATOR (V.O.) 
               Holidays are the times we enact age-old 
               rituals, solemn rites passed down from 
               one generation to the next.  A time for 
               family and friends and good cheer. 
               They're also a time for giving and 
               receiving -- a time for surprises. 
 
     Andy, tickled pink with himself, moves to the closet.  Pulls 
     out the gifts, the awful blue and gold wrapping paper with 
     the dreidels on it, mixed in with some Christmas ones. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Who finds Hannukkah paper in Everwood? 
               That's right.  I do. 
 
     He tries to hide the gifts... Behind clothes... Top shelf... 
     Shifts some junk around... Manages to squirrel away a couple. 
 
                         NARRATOR (V.O.) 
               Some surprises are hidden in boxes, 
               wrapped up in colorful paper and ribbons. 
               Still others we carry inside, concealed 
               in our own hearts, while we wait for just 
               the right moment to reveal them. 
 
     Just then, KEYS in the door.  VOICES. 
 
                         EPHRAM  (O.S.) 
               Hello? 
 
     Andy desperately tries to hide everything.  No luck.  As the 
     door opens, he panics and shuts himself inside the closet. 
     EPHRAM and MADISON enter.

               See?  Nobody's home.  Come here... 
 
     He smiles, tries to kiss her.  She playfully stops him. 
 
                         MADISON 
               I have to get Delia from next door, and 
               your dad could come home any second. 
 
 
     Confused, but curious, Andy reminds himself to breathe. 
     Quietly.  As he presses his ear to the door... 
 
3    BACK TO EPHRAM AND MADISON      3 
 
     Ephram takes her head, pulls her close to him.  They stand 
     like this for a moment -- close, hands linked.  A couple. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Your nose is all red. 
 
                         MADISON 
               Ephram... We can't.  We made a pact. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               I can't be tied to some pact when you're 
               standing here with a cute, red nose. 
 
     She smiles.  He kisses her.  She tries to refuse.  Kinda. 
 
                         MADISON 
               We said we wouldn't do anything in the 
               house.  What if he comes in--? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               I'll lock the door. 
 
                         MADISON 
               Like he wouldn't figure that out.  The 
               man's a brain surgeon, for godssakes. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Don't let the fancy title fool you.  My 
               dad's totally clueless.  We could be 
               making out on top of him and he still 
               wouldn't get it. 
 
4    BACK TO ANDY         4 
 
     Totally clueless about them.  Heretofore.  He tries to open 
     the closet.  But it's stuck from the inside.  Tries again. 
     STUCK.

     He kisses her again.  Their hands stay tangled. 
 
                         MADISON 
               You know if we don't tell him, he's just 
               going to find out on his own. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               He won't find out.  He's in his own world 
               half the time.  I spilled soda on the        * 
               couch the other night, right?  He told me 
               to clean it up, but as soon as he left 
               the room, I just flipped the pillow over. 
               I'm telling you, the man is dense. 
 
                         MADISON 
               No, he's not.  And you should be thankful 
               you have such a cool dad. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               He's cool when you're here.  From the 
               hours of six to nine.  Come by in the 
               morning, you'll be astounded by his 
               lameness.  I promise. 
 
     He kisses the other side of her neck. 
 
                         MADISON 
               It's wrong, Ephram.  We have to tell him. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Okay, how about this?  I'll tell my dad 
               about us, when you show me how to do that 
               tongue curl thing.

               But it would be fun to practice, right? 
 
     Ephram kisses her again.  She can't resist -- boy's too darn 
     cute.  As she relents:

     And it's on!  They fall back onto the couch together.  And 
     it's all lovely until, from the foyer -- RATTLE...THWACK... 
 
     CRASH!  Andy finally bursts out of the closet. 
 
     The young lovers bounce off the couch like it's a trampoline.

     Hard to tell who's more traumatized.  As they stand there, a

                                ACT ONE 
 
     FADE IN: 
 
 
     A shell-shocked Ephram and Madison sit on opposite ends of 
     the couch, forced apart by Andy's force-field of rage.  He 
     paces like a circus tiger. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               This is beyond unacceptable!  This is in 
               some other universe of unacceptability! 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               I think you're overreacting a little... 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Overreacting?  Oh, no no!  Maybe you 
               think this is just another example of my 
               uncool lameness, but I don't think it 
               would be possible to overreact to this, 
               Ephram.  How long has this been going on? 
 
                         MADISON 
               Not long.  I wanted to tell you-- 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               So I heard -- right after the tongue 
               curling lessons.  Thank god I was in the 
               closet just now. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Yeah, what's that about, anyway?  You're 
               spying on me now?  Whatever happened to 
               the right to privacy? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               When you're sixteen, there is no privacy. 
               The Constitution says nothing about 
               children having a right to privacy from 
               their parents.  And this... 
                   (pointing at them, flustered) 
               This is why there is no privacy when 
               you're sixteen.  This. 
 
                         MADISON 
               Look, this whole thing was sort of an 
               accident from the beginning.  It started 
               out as more of a kissing thing, and then 
               it just kinda--

                   (to Andy, anger building) 
               This is none of your business. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               None of my business?  I hired her.  I 
               brought her into this house.  She's twenty, 
               you're sixteen.  I think aiding and 
               abetting a felony makes it my business. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               So I'm sixteen, so what?  Would it be        * 
               better if I was having sex with someone 
               my own age? 
 
                         MADISON 
               Ephram!  We didn't have sex, Doctor 
               Brown.  I swear.  No sex at all. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               The fact is, Madison isn't your age and 
               whether you like it or not, that makes 
               all the difference.  This is a serious, 
               serious matter and we need to resolve it. 
                   (to Madison) 
               My first thought is to fire you. 
                   (then at Ephram) 
               And to kill you. 
                   (back to Madison) 
               And maybe kill you a little, too. 
               Something this irresponsible and this 
               stupid makes me wonder if you can be 
               trusted to take care of Delia at all. 
 
                         MADISON 
               You can trust me, Doctor Brown. 
 
     Andy considers if that's even possible. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Here's what we're going to do: Firing you 
               would be unfair to Delia, who is the only 
               one I don't want to suffer for this.  At 
               least until I can find someone else -- if 
               that becomes necessary.

               Whatever has been going on between you 
               two is over.  Now. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               No way! 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Completely and permanently.  We're going 
               to travel back in time, before any of 
               this ever happened, and we're going to 
               start over.  Understood? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               That's such bullsh-- 
 
                         MADISON 
                   (overlapped) 
               Totally.  This... This was a mistake.  It 
               shouldn't have happened, Doctor Brown. 
               I'm sorry. 
 
     Ephram stares at her: Et tu, Madison?  She doesn't look over. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Madison, you should leave now.  Ephram, 
               go to your room. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Madison-- 
 
     But she's already at the door, moving fast.  Ephram goes to 
     stop her... But she's gone.  Ephram reaches for the door-- 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Don't even think about it.  You do, she's 
               fired.  And you're grounded for life. 
 
     Ephram stops.  His humiliation and longing fuel his anger for 
     Andy, for ruining this great, glorious relationship.  He 
     shoots him a death look, then bolts upstairs. 
 
     Order restored, Andy drops into a chair, spent.  But we know, 
     as Andy does, that it's the kind of order that can't last.

               As it should be.  To you, she's a sweet, 
               doting grandmother.  To others, she's a 
               seventy-year-old thorn.  An impacted, 
               infected, painful thorn...  The kind that 
               gets in your bloodstream and makes its 
               way to your heart, where it tries to kill

                         DOCTOR ABBOTT (CONT'D) 
               I said, how are you, Herb? 
 
                         HERBERT 
               Oh, fine, fine.  How about a scotch? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
                   (under his breath) 
               I don't blame you.

               What's that? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               I said, coming right up.

               Awfully brisk in here, Harold.  Is it 
               really worth the pennies to keep the 
               thermostat this low?  I mean, there's 
               frugal and then there's just cheap. 
                   (then) 
               And where's our beautiful granddaughter? 
 
     Abbott and Rose share a look -- they have no clue. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Um... She should be home any minute.        * 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT            * 
               Yes... I'm sure she will.  From... where      * 
               she is...                * 
 
                         CAROL 
               So you don't even know where your sixteen- 
               year-old daughter is.  Interesting. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               She's not exactly -- 
 
                         CAROL 
               No need to explain.  I'm sure you know 
               what you're doing... 
                   (as Bright enters with luggage) 
               Take those up to your parents' room, 
               sweetie.  That's a good boy. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Our room?  Actually I was thinking you'd 
               sleep -

     A Native American boy, CHARLIE GREY CLOUD (13), is typing

     bandage to the blistered sole of his foot.

                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               You're lucky the burn only involved the      * 
               outer layer of skin.  This could have been      * 
               a lot worse, Charlie.            * 
 
                         CHARLIE 
               Yeah... Hey, Doc.  Say cheese. 
 
     When Andy looks up, still holding the foot, Charlie snaps a 
     picture with his cell phone. 
 
                         CHARLIE (CONT'D) 
               I'm gonna E this to Billy.  He's such a 
               wuss-out. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Who's Billy?  And more importantly, why 
               would he want a picture of your foot? 
 
     As he takes a gander at Charlie's fancy camera phone. 
 
                         CHARLIE 
               My friend.  He bet me he could hold out 
               longer, but he totally bailed.  He barely 
               put his foot on the coal before he quit. 
               So are we done? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               We're done...  But I'd like to know why 
               you'd burn yourself like this, Charlie. 
               It's a pretty dangerous game to be 
               playing just for kicks, don't you think? 
 
                         CHARLIE 
               We weren't playing.  We were practicing. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Practicing?  For what? 
 
                         CHARLIE 
               Me and Billy are doing the firewalk 
               tomorrow.  We wanted to try it ahead of 
               time, just to see.  Dad always says if 
               you practice really hard, things get 
               easier. 
 
     Suddenly, Charlie's BLACKBERRY goes off.  He pulls it out. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I don't understand.  Your father made you 
               do this?  Is this some kind of 
               Thanksgiving tradition for your family?

               No way, dude.  Thanksgiving's not real 
               big out on the Reservation, you know? 
 
     Edna enters with a pair of crutches. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Did your father bring you today?  Maybe I 
               could speak with him. 
 
                         CHARLIE 
               No way.  I took the bus.  The doctor at 
               the Res would've told him.  That's why I 
               came here.  You're free, right? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (smiles and nods) 
               Yeah, I'm free.  But I'd like to talk to 
               your father.  With your foot in this sort 
               of condition -- you shouldn't be placing 
               it on any hot coals for awhile.   Maybe 
               when you're a little older... 
 
     Charlie gingerly stands and starts out. 
 
                         CHARLIE 
               Gotta do it now.  Hey, can I have a cane? 
               A cane would be cool. 
 
                         EDNA 
               Sorry, all out.  How about some crutches? 
 
                         CHARLIE 
               Nah, those are lame.  S'all good. 
 
     He limps out.  Andy watches him go, worried. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Am I missing something here, Edna?  I 
               know that conditions on some reservations 
               can be pretty tough, but this seems so 
               outdated. 
 
                         EDNA 
               What about that kid struck you as 
               outdated?  He's carrying more high-tech 
               gear than we've got in this office. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               And with limited resources, that seems a 
               little misplaced, don't you think?

     Edna smiles to herself.  Off Andy, thinking he just might... 
 
 
     Andy's at the counter, talking to NINA about the whole 
     Madison/Ephram debacle.  She leans in close. 
 
                         NINA 
               I gotta hand it to you Andy, first Carl 
               comes out of the closet -- now you. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               ...It was horrifying.  There they were, 
               in flagrante delicto. 
 
                         NINA 
               I guess you can't really blame Ephram. 
               He is a sixteen-year-old boy, and she's-- 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Twenty!  She's twenty. Ephram was like 
               four a couple years ago.  Lock Sam up now. 
 
     With that, LINDA walks in, whom Andy has been more than a 
     little weird with since the revelation of her HIV status. 
 
                         LINDA 
               Hey, Andy.  Hey, Nina. 
 
                         NINA 
               Hi, Linda. I'll get your pie. 
 
     Nina disappears into the back. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Pie, huh? How very un-tofu of you. 
 
                         LINDA 
               It's for dinner tomorrow, at Harry's. 
               Being a holiday and all, I thought it 
               best to avoid the reaction Delia had to 
               my cooking. 
 
     Andy smiles, but looks for Nina to return quickly.  Which she 
     does.  Thank goodness.  Deflecting:

               That smells great.  Maybe I'll take one 
               one of those, too. 
 
                         NINA 
               Too late, this is the last one.  Mama Joy 
               tradition -- gotta call ahead, Andy. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Next year, then... Pie.  Definitely.

               You know, you're welcome to join the 
               Abbott clan for dessert tomorrow.  I'll 
               make sure you get a piece. 
 
     His heart and head still in a Peckinpah standoff over Linda, 
     Andy's caught off-guard.  He tries to dance around it. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I'd love to, but I can't.  The kids and I 
               have a whole thing planned.  They look 
               forward to it all year, especially Delia. 
                   (again, towards Nina) 
               We had quite a time of it last year, 
               didn't we Nina?  You and Sam are coming 
               again, right? 
 
                         NINA 
               Actually, we're going to my folks this 
               year.  Sorry we'll miss it, though.  It 
               was... something. 
 
     Linda senses Andy's discomfort at her invite.  So does Nina. 
 
                         LINDA 
               Don't worry about it.  If you change your 
               mind... 
 
     She exits, Andy watching her go.  Off Nina, discreetly 
     watching, too. 
 
 
     Madison and DELIA are working on Thanksgiving decorations. 
     We HEAR Ephram pounding out something very unfestive on the 
     piano.  Wagner, perhaps. 
 
                         DELIA 
               It sounds like the music from when they 
               killed Bambi.

               It's normal for people to get depressed

                         DELIA 
               It's the eyelashes.  Makes them prettier. 
 
     Ephram walks in, eyes the project.  Gets an idea.  To Delia: 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               You're running low on construction paper. 
 
                         DELIA 
               It's okay.  I have more in my room.

               If you get it, I'll help you guys.

               Nothing is going on.  It can't.  You

               Screw my dad.  I don't care what he says. 
 
                         MADISON 
               Well, I care what he says.  And he's not 
               totally wrong. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               How could he not be wrong when he doesn't

               Look, I knew what we were doing was 
               wrong, I knew it wouldn't work, and I 
               knew it would be worse if we didn't tell

               You said you liked me.  You said I made 
               you undone.  I'm not exactly sure what 
               that meant, but I know it's good and I 
               know it doesn't just go away.  Not when 
               you really care for somebody.  There's no      *

                         EPHRAM 
               That's not the same.  Can't is because of 
               my dad.  Don't is all you. 
 
     Madison doesn't respond.  Delia runs in carrying loads of 
     construction paper.

               Can't or Don't.  Just tell me. 
 
     Madison takes a beat.  She looks Ephram in the eyes, knows 
     this is the moment of truth.  Finally:

     Ouch.  With that, Ephram walks out.  Delia watches him go. 
     Then, to Madison: 
 
                         DELIA 
               More Bambi music? 
 
     But she doesn't respond.  Off Madison, facade crumbling...

                                ACT TWO 
 
     FADE IN: 
 
 
     Abbott is sitting, reading the paper.  His brief peace is 
     shattered soon enough when Carol enters. 
 
                         CAROL 
               Well, that was just about the worst night 
               of sleep I've ever had. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               And good morning to you, too. 
 
                         CAROL 
               I thought you'd be doing us a favor by 
               letting us sleep in your bed, but I can't 
               imagine the sleeper sofa's any worse. 
               It's a wonder Rose isn't in traction. 
               And where are you hiding the good toilet 
               paper?  That stuff you've got is like 
               sackcloth...  It's Thanksgiving Day, for      * 
               heaven's sake.  At least turn on the        * 
               parade.                  * 
 
     As he rises to escape, the front door opens.  Edna enters, 
     toting a bag from Tommy's store. 
 
                         EDNA 
               Brought the stuff for the fruit salad, 
               Junior. 
 
                         CAROL 
               You should be more careful with it, Edna. 
               It's no good if it's bruised. 
 
                         EDNA 
               Bruised?  Doubt you can do much through a 
               can of Del Monte. 
                   (perfunctory pleasantry) 
               How are you, Carol?  How was your trip? 
 
                         CAROL 
               Well, Rose had to pick us up by herself, 
               but it was uneventful.  Are you still 
               married to the black man? 
 
     Edna's eyes widen, along with her nostrils.  Abbott quickly 
     steers her toward... 
 
 
 
     Everwood - "Unhappy Holidays"   10/21/03   Full Blue    3. 
 
 
 
 
 
     A deep disdain for Carol is the one thing these two agree on. 
     As Abbott makes coffee... 
 
                         EDNA 
               How your wife was spawned from that 
               woman's loins, I'll never know.  Good 
               thing she got all the recessive genes. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               She's insufferable, absolutely 
               insufferable.  It's a wonder Herb hasn't 
               just killed her in her sleep. 
 
                         EDNA 
               I'd testify on his behalf. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               I'd visit him in prison every day just to 
               thank him. 
 
                         EDNA 
               Well, don't sweat it too much, Junior. 
               In-laws are a necessary evil -- your 
               dad's mother was a bitch on wheels 
               herself.  Couple more days and it'll be 
               over.  And you'll have bought yourself 
               some mighty good graces with the missus, 
               if you know what I mean. 
 
     Abbott winces.  Not appropriate mom talk in his mind. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Mother, please. 
 
                         EDNA 
               I met Amy's new boyfriend.  Seems like a 
               nice kid. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Boyfriend?  What boyfriend?  What are you 
               talking about?  Since when does--? 
 
                         EDNA 
               Rein it in there, cowboy.  She wasn't 
               heading to Vegas in a wedding gown.  He's 
               just some boy; works at the drug store. 
               I think his name was Tommy Calla- 
               something.  Anyway, you'll meet him at 
               dinner tonight.

                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               He's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?  How? 
               Why...? 
 
     Before he tailspins again, Edna indicates the canned fruit. 
 
                         EDNA 
               Might wanna mix those.  I'll be back with 
               Irv in a few hours... 
 
     Off Abbott, processing... 
 
 
     Bustling with BELLS and lights and money.  A scantily-clad 
     squaw-esque WAITRESS points Andy toward a blackjack table. 
 
 
     Andy addresses the DEALER. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Hi, I'm looking for Mr. Grey Cloud... 
 
                         DEALER 
                   (waving over his Pit Boss) 
               Boss. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Boss? 
 
     RANDY GREY CLOUD (late 30s), well dressed, pure charm, steps 
     over.  A warrior of only his stock portfolio. 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
               You looking for a Player's Card? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               A what?  Oh, no.  I'm Andrew Brown.  We 
               spoke on the phone. 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
               Yes, of course.  Welcome. 
                   (re: Andy's awe) 
               I'm guessing this is your first time. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               To a casino, no.  To a reservation... 
               this is a reservation, right? 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
               C'mon, I'll give you the tour.

     Grey Cloud and Andy stroll through the buzzing throng... 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Is it always this busy? 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
               Most days.  We had an accounting 
               convention last week.  Packed. 
 
     Andy nods, impressed, then cuts to the chase. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Listen, the reason why I came here... 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
               Charlie.  I know.  He told me what 
               happened.  Practicing for the firewalk, 
               what a nut. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I realize I'm involving myself in a 
               culture I can't claim to understand, but 
               I'd feel remiss if I didn't say something 
               about how dangerous, you know... walking 
               on fire actually is. 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
               You're worried about Charlie, I get it, I 
               appreciate it.  But we've been doing this 
               for centuries -- haven't lost a foot yet. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Between the roulette wheel over there 
               and your son's prolific use of his cell 
               phone, you don't strike me as a family 
               holding on to outdated traditions. 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
                   (points) 
               See that waitress?  She's wearing an 
               Onadoga headdress and Hopi shoes.  Her       * 
               necklace is from a tribe my tribe used to 
               kill -- it's a hodge-podge that would've 
               made my grandfather cry.  So much 
               changes, so much gets lost.  You have to 
               hold on to tradition where you can. 
               Embrace the new, revere the old. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               If you revere walking, you'll let Charlie 
               wait a few weeks.  Give him some time to 
               heal.

               No can do.  It's supposed to blizzard 
               this weekend. 
                   (off Andy's look) 
               My boy has to walk before the first knee- 
               high snowfall.  That's the time of the 
               Sojourn, when the gods would guide the 
               tribe to the winter encampment...  Plus 
               it's too late to cancel the caterers. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Indian Bar Mitzvah, hunh? 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
               I hate to tell you what I spent on the 
               band. 
                   (then, sincere) 
               Don't worry, Doc.  My son will do the 
               firewalk, just like I did before him and 
               every forefather before me.  Now how 
               about we set you up with a few chips on 
               on the house, see if you can help us buy 
               back Manhattan. 
 
     He claps Andy on the shoulder.  Off Andy... 
 
 
 Dinner prep: Rose peels stuff, Linda combines Edna's fruit. 
  Amy enters, doing her charming daughter routine. 
 
                         AMY 
               Hey, guys.  Can I help? 
  
                         ROSE 
                   (shocked to her core) 
               Of course.  Grab a peeler. 
 
     Amy peels alongside her mother, gauging how long she has to 
     peel before she can finally ask: 
 
                         AMY 
               So would it be okay if I invite somebody 
               for dinner tonight?  I know it's kinda 
               short notice, but... 
 
                         ROSE 
               Is it a friend from school? 
 
                         AMY 
               Sorta from school.  But he transferred.

                         AMY 
                   (blushing) 
               It's not like that.  It's just that his 
               family's kind of messed up and he was 
               going to spend Thanksgiving all alone. 
               And I was telling him how your cranberry 
               sauce is the best ever... 
 
                         ROSE 
               That's true.  It is. 
 
                         AMY 
               Anyway, I just thought it would be nice 
               if he could spend the holiday with a 
               family.  I mean you always say, holidays 
               are times for people to be charitable 
               towards one another, and-- 
 
                         ROSE 
               He can come, sweetheart. 
 
                         AMY 
               Really?  Thanks, Mom. 
 
     Amy gives Rose a kiss on the cheek, then skips out. 
 
                         LINDA 
               Wow.  Was that Amy being happy? 
 
                         ROSE 
               Don't say the word out loud.  You might 
               jinx it.  Oh heavens, I didn't even 
               ask...

     Abbott and Bright move down an aisle, mid-conversation. 
     Herbert wanders behind him, in his own world. 
 
                         BRIGHT 
               Why are you asking me about him?

               Why?  Do you know him?

               I thought he still in rehab. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Rehab?  Amy is dating an alcoholic? 
 
                         BRIGHT 
               Oh, no.  He was more into drugs. 
               He got busted with a crapload of crystal 
               meth on him, and about five baggies worth 
               of weed.  But he might have just been 
               selling the pot. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               So he's a dealer and a junkie.  That's 
               just wonderful.  Are you sure about this? 
               Because if these are simply rumors... 
 
                         BRIGHT 
               Look, all's I know for sure is he got 
               kicked out of County two years ago. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               For drugs. 
 
                         BRIGHT 
               No.  He tried to burn down the school. 
               So I guess he's sort of an arsonist, too. 
               You might wanna hide the matches.

     Abbott goes ashen, wondering when the Fates decided to turn 
     on him.  Off his mounting concern, we SMASH CUT TO: 
 
 
     Ephram, Andy and Madison prepping dinner.  DELIA is VIDEO 
     TAPING their efforts.  Andy's pretending everything is fine. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (to Ephram) 
               How are those potatoes coming?  No 
               fingertips in there yet, I hope. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Ephram, you have to stand closer to 
               Madison, so I can get you both in the 
               little box. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Enough with the camera, Delia. 
 
                         DELIA 
               It's the new tradition, remember?  You 
               started it last year. 
 
     Ephram keeps hacking away at the sink.  Madison keeps her 
     head down, avoiding eye contact with everybody. 
 
                         DELIA (CONT'D) 
                   (still filming) 
               Okay, Madison.  You have to look in the 
               camera and tell me what you're thankful 
               for. 
 
                         MADISON 
               I don't know, sweetie.  Maybe you should 
               go first. 
 
                         DELIA 
               That's easy.  I'm grateful for you. 
 
     Madison looks at Delia, then at Ephram.  Ephram can't look at 
     her. Andy can't look at her.  This is a nightmare.  Finally: 
 
                         MADISON 
                   (re: her three-bean salad) 
               Okay... Um, this just needs to marinate 
               for a couple hours.  And as far as the 
               turkey goes... 
 
                         DELIA 
               You're not leaving are you?

                         MADISON 
               I have to, sweetie. 
 
                         DELIA 
               But you said your family went to Florida 
               for Thanksgiving and you'd eat here with 
               us. 
 
     With that, Madison burns herself on the pan. 
 
                         MADISON 
               Ouch.  Dammit. 
 
     Ephram springs to her aid.  Puts her hand under cold water, 
     then fetches some ice and a towel. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Let me look at that. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               I've got it. 
 
                         MADISON 
               I'm fine, really. 
 
     As Ephram wraps her hand, their eyes meet.  And we SEE it. 
     More importantly, Ephram sees it: that look that tells him 
     she still has all those feelings.  Her eyes tear up. 
 
                         MADISON (CONT'D) 
               I'm sorry, I-- I have to go. 
 
                         DELIA 
               But you're coming back, right? 
 
                         MADISON 
               I don't think so. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Tomorrow, though?  You'll be back 
               tomorrow. 
 
                         MADISON 
               I can't come back anymore, honey. 
                   (a last glance at Ephram) 
               I just can't. 
 
     And she flees the house.  Ephram watches in shock and horror. 
     Then turns on Andy, venom in every word. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               You did this.

                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I didn't-- 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Everything would've been fine if it 
               wasn't for you.  But you had to screw it 
               all up like you always do. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Screw what up? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Delia, could you go to your room for a 
               minute, please? 
 
                         DELIA 
               No. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               You couldn't stand that I was finally 
               happy.  You hated that I had somebody and 
               you didn't. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               You know that isn't true.  It was wrong, 
               Ephram, and I couldn't just look the 
               other way.  Madison knew that and she 
               agreed with me. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               She agreed because you threatened her. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Why did you threaten Madison?  Don't you 
               like her? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Of course I like her.  But not for dating 
               your brother. 
 
                         DELIA 
               You're dating Madison?  Like, with 
               kissing? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               You tell me you want me to grow up, but 
               you don't.  You just want me to stay a 
               kid so you can do all your stupid father 
               stuff that you missed out on and feel 
               guilty about.  Well, it's too late.  I'm 
               a man and I can make my own decisions.

                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               You're not a man.  If you were, you'd 
               realize how childish you're being right 
               now.  Upsetting your sister, blaming me 
               for your mistakes...  You don't have to 
               believe this, but I am sorry you're 
               hurting and I'm sure this is very 
               difficult for Madison as well.  But the 
               two of you put me in an impossible 
               situation. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               How can something be impossible if it's 
               happening?  And it was.  It was great and 
               you couldn't deal, so you made it 
               impossible.  You make my entire life 
               impossible. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               This isn't a question of what I can deal   * 
               with, Ephram.                * 
 
 
                         EPHRAM              * 
               Yes it is.  You're alone, that's your        * 
               thing.  But you know what?  I'm not you.      * 
               I don't want to be like you.  If Madison      * 
               and I want this, that's all that matters.      * 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN            * 
               Ephram...                * 
 
                         EPHRAM              * 
               I shouldn't have to be alone just because 
               you are. 
 
     And he's gone.  Delia stares at her father a beat, then she 
     runs off, too.  Off Andy, alone in a cornucopia of misery. 
 
 
     Where Abbott confronts Amy, Rose riding shotgun. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               How long have you been seeing him?  I

                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               You're damn right, "here we go!"  It's 
               bad enough we didn't know where you were 
               last night with your grandparents here, 
               but I have to learn about this boy you're 
               running around with my mother. 
 
                         AMY 
               I'm not "running around." 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Is this who you've been out all night 
               with when you say you're with Laynie?  Is 
               that what's been going on? 
 
                         ROSE 
               Amy, is that true?  Have you been lying 
               to us? 
 
     Amy looks away. 
 
                         AMY 
               No.  Maybe sometimes.

                   (crushed) 
               Amy... 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               It doesn't matter, because you are never 
               to see him again.  Period. 
 
                         AMY 
               Yeah, I am, because he's gonna be here 
               for dinner in like, two hours. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Over my dead body.  You are going to 
               uninvite that boy right now.  Where's 
               your phone...? 
 
                         AMY 
               I'm not uninviting him.  That's insane! 
               Besides, Mom said-- 
 
                         ROSE 
               I said that before I knew you were lying to me. 
 
                         AMY 
               I didn't lie!  His family is messed up 
               and he has nowhere to go.  All of that is 
               totally true.

               Yes, and it's also true that he was 
               kicked out of school-- 
 
                         ROSE 
               Kicked out?  You said he transferred. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               As well as being a meth addict with a 
               propensity towards arson.  You really 
               picked a winner, Amy.

               Where'd you hear that?  Bright? 
                   (off Abbott's look) 
               Figures.  Tommy never did meth.  And so 
               he was in rehab for awhile, so what?  You 
               made me talk to some stupid counselor. 
               At least his stuff helped.  You know, 
               people can change.  Even if you never do. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Don't talk to your father that way. 
 
                         AMY 
               Why not?  I'm supposed to uninvite 
               someone because he's so closed-minded and 
               believes every stupid rumor Bright tells 
               him? 
                   (then) 
               If you don't want him here, that's fine. 
               We'll go somewhere else for Thanksgiving. 
               It's up to you. 
 
     Face-off.  Off Abbott, undecided and completely worn out... 
 
                         CAROL 
               Is everything okay in here?  I thought I

     Apart from Amy, the whole clan is seated around the bountiful

     slice the mammoth turkey.

               I think we've waited long enough. 
 
     Just then, Amy walks in with Tommy, who's carrying a lovely

               Thank you for having me, Mrs. Abbott.

               You're late. 
 
                         TOMMY 
               That's my fault, sir.  The only flowers 
               left at the first place were kinda dead, 
               so I drove around looking for another 
               place that was open.  I'm really sorry. 
 
     Most of the room is charmed, except Rose, Harold and Bright.

                   (stepping out) 
               I'll just put these in some water...

               Well isn't he sweet as apple pie?  You

                   (then, to Abbott) 
               You going to carve that thing Harold, or 
               should we just tear into it with our 
               hands? 
 
     Carol smiles a playful smile at Tommy.  Abbott pretends the 
     bird is her and hacks away, trying to cut out the heart.

               I'm not hungry.  And you can't call me 
               "sweetie" when I don't like you. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               What about the salad?  The salad's great. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Madison made it.  And I don't want any if 
               she's not here. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Well, you have Dad to thank for that. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Only 'cause you started it. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               I didn't kick her out.  He's the one who 
               who made her go-- 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Knock it off.  It's Thanksgiving, guys. 
               We're a family.  The three of us. 
               Madison may have been a nice addition for 
               a little while, but she chose to leave 
               tonight.  I didn't make her go.  Delia, 
               did you hear me tell her to leave? 
 
                         DELIA 
               All I know is she was my friend.  And now 
               she's gone.

               Can I please go to my room? 
 
     Andy sighs, knows he's lost this battle. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               If you want to. 
 
     Delia walks out of the room.  And then there were two. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               You know what's really sad? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Don't start, Ephram... 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               We've been here for a year and a half 
               now, and look at this table.  There's no 
               one here.  Don't you think there's 
               something wrong with that?  When Mom made 
               Thanksgiving, it was this big deal.  We 
               had like, twenty people at the table. 
               That's why it was Delia's favorite 
               holiday.  It was fun. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               We can go to your grandparents next year, 
               if you want... 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               What I want is to be able to have a life. 
               And I wouldn't even mind having to share 
               it with you.  But you won't let it 
               happen.  You're so busy controlling 
               everything, I don't even think you know 
               what it is you're controlling anymore. 
               What is so wrong about me and Madison? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               A million things-- 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               No, there's not.  I know you're freaked 
               about the age thing, but there's more to 
               it than that.  I can tell.  What I can't 
               figure out is what it could be.  She's 
               great.  She's smart.  She loves Delia. 
               She even likes you.  So what is it that 
               you're trying to stop? 
 
       Andy considers this.  And for some reason, he can't come up 
       with the answer.  So he pulls the parent card:

               May I be excused?

               want him happy -- just within the 
               confines of the law.  That's not selfish, 
               is it? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Protecting them?  It's common sense. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Where were you an hour ago? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Storming out of my own house. 
                   (then) 
               I used to look forward to going home. 
               There were days I'd have Louise cancel my 
               4:30 so I could get back at the same time 
               as the kids.  My whole day was trying to 
               get done with what I had to do so I could 
               get back to the house...  Now I'm looking 
               for places to hide.  Now I'm here.  When 
               did this become preferable? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Around the time they decided everything 
               was our fault. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBBOTT 
               I had it right once.  Not even that long 
               ago.  When you first got to this town I 
               had the family I'd always wanted...  Amy 
               and I spent every Friday night together 
               watching old movies -- I didn't even have 
               to remind her...  Then we got off track 
               and even that was fine, it was just off 
               track. 
                   (beat) 
               And then one day it was different, the 
               family I'd known wasn't off track 
               anymore, it was gone. 
 
     A beat.  Andy can tell Abbott's hurting.

               I'm hardly one to trust with advice but 
               I'm pretty sure about one thing. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               What? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Whatever we're doing right now isn't 
               helping.  This place doesn't exactly 
               foment joy. 
 
     Off Andy...  Maybe... 
 
 
     Delia lies in her bed, miserable.  Ephram knocks and enters. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Leave me alone. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               I'm gonna go see her.  You need to come. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Why? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Because I can't leave you here by 
               yourself. 
                   (beat) 
               And because I need your help. 
 
     That piques Delia's interest. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Go on. 
 
     Ephram moves in and sits on the bed. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               I'm sorry, Delia.  I know I messed things 
               up for you.  But I never thought any of 
               this would actually happen, and then it 
               did and...  The thing is, I like Madison 
               just as much as you do, only different. 
               You know? 
 
     Delia gives up nothing, makes him do all the heavy lifting.

     SMASH CUT TO: A ROULETTE BALL, spinning a wide circle around

     Roulette... Just one of a thousand gaudy delights offered by   *

                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               So what's your game?  Roulette?  Pai Gow? 
               Casino War? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               You don't actually expect me to fork over 
               my hard-earned cash to some card shark in 
               a clip-on tie.  Nickle slots for 
               entertainment is one thing, but Baccarat? 
               Hundred-dollar-limit tables?  If you want 
               to hand your money away hand it to me. 
               Only an imbecile would --

               Then again... a hand or two of blackjack 
               wouldn't kill anyone. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Are you sure you wouldn't rather stick to 
               the nickle slots? 
 
     Har-har.  Finding a table, Abbott lays down a ten spot.  The

     $15.00 comes Abbott's way 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Well that was pleasant enough. 
 
     Abbott pulls up a chair, makes himself more comfortable. 
     CHEERING from a nearby room attracts Andy.  He looks to SEE: 
 
     Charlie Grey Cloud in a suit, surrounded by FAMILY and 
     FRIENDS, hands pumped and hugged heartily. 
 
 
     A gala with everything but a haftora:  GUESTS dancing, BAND 
     playing, centerpieces sparkling, gifts piled high, a      * 
     "CONGRATULATIONS CHARLIE" sign in flashing flame letters.    * 
     Even a cake shaped like a hockey rink.  An amused Andy takes   * 
     in meshugas from the doorway, where Randy spots him. 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
               You're becoming a regular. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               So he did it.  Congratulations. 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
               Without so much as a blister. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               And now he's a man? 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
               Don't know about that.  The kid still 
               doesn't brush his teeth until I tell him 
               three times.  But in the eyes of 
               tradition... 
 
     They share a smile.  Grey Cloud looks at his son getting 
     pinched on the cheek by an OVER-AFFECTIONATE AUNT. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               If it's all just for show why not just 
               throw the party?  I know the firewalk is 
               supposed to be about preparing the young 
               for the trials of adulthood.  Ordeal as 
               rite of passage, all that Joseph Campbell 
               jazz...  But given his medical condition, 
               I never would have let my son walk. 
 
                         GREY CLOUD 
               Then you would have failed him.

               The truth is, Doctor, today was more a 
               rite of passage for me than it was for 
               Charlie.  You saw him, he was more 
               worried about losing his cell phone 
               reception than his feet.  Me, I don't 
               think I've ever been that scared.  When 
               he stepped up to the fire, all I wanted 
               to do was run and get him out of there, 
               pull him off.  Standing still and letting 
               it happen, watching my son come close to 
               danger...  it was one of the hardest 
               things I've ever done. 
                   (and then) 
               Today may have made him a man in the eyes 
               of tradition, but today also made me 
               ready to be the father of a man. 
 
     As they look on together at the celebration of his son... 
 
28   BACK AT THE BLACK JACK TABLE      28 
 
     ...The dealer turns over a 6.  Abbott's face drops. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               How can you possibly hit 21 four times in 
               a row?  It's statistically impossible! 
 
     He pulls out his wallet, takes out a wad of bills. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT (CONT'D) 
               More chips please.  And some good cards. 
 
     This could be the start of a terrible relationship... 
 
 
     Outside Abbott's house.  Andy is dropping off Abbott.  Who 
     does not look well at all. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               You sure you want to go in alone?  I can 
               check if the coast is clear. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               You should never have left me at that 
               table. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I tried to stop you. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               All those flashing lights, the constant 
               noise, every five minutes another drink 
               in my hand...  I was clearly in a 
               hypnotic state.  How could you let me 
               continue?  What were you thinking? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I was thinking you'd quit after the first 
               two grand.  Who told you to split fives? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
                   (numb) 
               Seven thousand dollars in three hours... 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Two and a half, actually --

               -- You're not helping.

               Indians... On Thanksgiving...  Should've 
               known... 
 
     And off Abbott drags, back into his house, even worse off 
     than when he left.  And that's saying something. 
 
 
     A dour Andy enters.  He spots Ephram who sits by the 
     fireplace.  It's lit up.  Hard to say who's more tense. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               You made a fire?

     Andy shrugs.  Another sign of his son's independence.  He 
     takes a seat beside Ephram. 
 
     Ephram steels himself, takes a breath, then:

               I saw Madison tonight.  And I'm gonna

               I know.  I'm not gonna try. 
 
     Ephram sits up a little straighter. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN (CONT'D) 
               I'm gonna let you do this, Ephram.  I

               a mistake.  But I think I have to let you

               Gotta admit.  Not where I thought this

               I've known that for a long time now.  But 
               that doesn't mean you're ready for 
               something like this.  More importantly, 
               it doesn't mean I'm ready to watch

               I value what we've been building here too

               stop you.  And I also know that if I

               much more appealing.

               This isn't some act of rebellion on my

               I know.  And I'm sorry.  Really, I am. 
               It just sort of happened before I thought

               Yeah.  Life's like that a lot. 
 
     HOLD ON them, just sitting there, father and son, man to man. 
 
 
     Abbott withers in a chair while a weary Rose scolds.  Carol 
     hovers nearby, her two cents burning a hole in her pocket.

               I can't begin to imagine what you were 
               thinking.  After the day we've had, I

               credit card companies to ask if our 
               card's been stolen.  Someone's running up 
               a tab, they say.  A casino, Harold.

               Well, I hope you're proud of yourself. 
               Pardon me for saying this, but from where 
               I stand, you're failing this family.

                         ROSE 
               Mother, please. 
 
                         CAROL 
               What?  It's true. 
                   (back to Harold) 
               You've lost Amy.  And Bright's never 
               going to amount to much because you 
               didn't push him enough from the 
               beginning.  I could tell when he was 
               still little that you weren't raising him      * 
               right.  Now you're a profligate gambler 
               to boot.  If only Rose had married 
               Richard McKenna. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Oh, here we go.  The Richard McKenna 
               speech. 
 
                         CAROL 
               I knew in high school that you would 
               stifle my daughter into middle-class 
               limbo.  Instead of just mayor of         * 
               Everwood, Rose could have been governor      * 
               of the whole state.  But she settled for      * 
               you instead, a man content to follow in 
               his father's footsteps.  And sure enough, 
               you walked down the same dead end that he 
               did and dragged my legacy right along 
               with you. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Mother, shut up. 
 
                         CAROL 
               Excuse me? 
 
                         ROSE 
               I said, shut up.  How dare you come into 
               our home and pass judgment like that. 
               Harold may have screwed up big time 
               tonight, but he's as fine a husband as 
               any man.  Don't ever say that I settled. 
               I'm a lucky woman, Mother.  And as good a 
               husband as he is, he's an even better 
               father.  His only fault may have been to 
               love his kids too much sometimes, but 
               everything he's ever done was to help 
               them, not tear them down like you 
               constantly did to your children. 
 
                         CAROL 
               Rose, how can you say that to me?

               Easy. She's right. 
 
     He carries two glasses of scotch.  Hands Abbott one. 
 
                         HERBERT (CONT'D) 
               Why do you think the kids never come to 
               visit us? 
                   (a rhetorical beat) 
               Now go up and pack so we can leave these 
               people in peace first thing tomorrow. 
                   (off Carol's glare) 
               I said go. 
 
     Stunned, and finally speechless, Carol exits. 
 
                         HERBERT (CONT'D) 
               I know you two aren't having an easy time 
               of it right now.  Me, I wouldn't wish 
               parenthood on my worst enemy. 
                   (then, warmly) 
               Good luck to you...  You're always in my 
               prayers. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Good night, Daddy.

     He goes.  Rose and Harold share a look.  Off Abbott, in

     Madison sits at the table with Delia.

               So are you back for real?

               That's the plan. 
 
                         DELIA 
               So we can go back to how it was before? 
               You're my baby-sitter? 
 
                         MADISON 
               Well, yes and no.  I am your baby-sitter, 
               but it won't be exactly like it was 
               before.

               Exactly.  And I don't want you to be 
               upset with your dad or Ephram.  We're all 
               gonna start over from scratch. 
 
                         DELIA 
               We do that a lot around here. 
                   (then, incredulous) 
               You really like Ephram? 
 
     Madison smiles and Andy enters from upstairs. 
 
                         MADISON 
               I gotta talk to your dad for a second, 
               okay, sweetie?  Then we're on leftover 
               patrol.  Sound good?

               All right!  Turkey sandwiches... 
 
     As Delia races upstairs, Madison turns to Andy... 
 
                         MADISON 
               Hey, Doctor Brown.  I wanted to apologize 
               again and thank you for everything.  The 
               job, I mean. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               You're good at it.  The job, I mean. 
 
     Madison smiles. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN (CONT'D) 
               I have to ask something. 
 
                         MADISON 
               Sure.  What is it? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Do you remember your first love? 
 
                         MADISON 
               Yeah.  Of course I do. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Then you remember how it felt when it 
               ended.  You must remember.

               That kind of pain, it really only does 
               happen once.  But it stays with you, 
               forever. 
 
     Madison isn't sure she gets this yet, so she just nods. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN (CONT'D) 
               Ephram hasn't felt that yet.  He's had 
               crushes.  Some real good ones, too.  But 
               he's never had a girlfriend.  You'll be 
               his first. 
 
     Oh.  Now she gets it.

               Yeah.  He told me that.            *

               make a lot of sense.  But I just felt it,   * 
               you know?  I guess maybe I should think      * 
               more and feel less, but...  Maybe I'm        * 
               still na ve enough to think it can work,      * 
               too.                  * 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I know Ephram thinks he's a man.  I know 
               you see him that way.  But he's not. 
               He's still a boy.  And his heart is wide 
               open.  Be careful with it. 
 
     Andy exits.  Off Madison, his words of caution settling in...

     Still nothing.  Abbott arrives at the door.  THUMP-THUMPS it.

               That is enough, come on out here this

     He JAGGLES the knob.  Locked.  He forces the handle, which

     AMY'S ROOM IS EMPTY.  With the window open.  The cold fall

     Abbott and Rose speak to the SHERIFF.  Carol, Herbert, and
