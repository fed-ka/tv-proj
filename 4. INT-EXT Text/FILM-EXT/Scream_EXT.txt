CASEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING
A big country home with a huge sprawling lawn full of big oak
trees.
It sits alone with no neighbors in sight.
The phone RINGS again.
SIDE OF HOUSE
Casey it at the back corner of the house.
MAN
I can hear you. I know you're here.
Casey eases along a narrow path between a tall fence and the side
of the house...going for the front yard.
She must pass the three
curtainless windows.
She gets to the first one and peeks in...
The FIGURE has pulled open the foyer closet, searching for her.
Casey creeps along, to the next window, she looks in...the FIGURE
is completely on the other side of the room moving toward the hall
that leads to other parts of the house.
She moves further along the house...squeezing by hedges...to the
third window...she peeks in to the FIGURE...
STARING BACK AT HER...
His face covered with a ghostly white mask, inches from her...his
eyes piercing through...soulless...Casey SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as
a hand...
CRASHES through the glass window grabbing hold of her neck...she
beats at him trying to free herself...her nails dig into his
arm...she wrenches from side to side...finally breaking free as
the hands disappear inside the house...
CORNER OF HOUSE
Casey sails around the corner of the house, eyeing the front door.
It remains closed.
Her eyes cover the sprawling country yard when
suddenly....
HEADLIGHTS APPEAR
in the distance, coming down the road towards the house...she
recognizes them instantly.
Mom...Dad...she tears off across the
yard toward them...moving like lightning...
The car turns into the driveway...Casey SCREAMS, waving madly,
rushing by a tree as...
THE GHOST MASKED FIGURE APPEARS
Casey stumbles back, catching her balance...the FIGURE moves on
her, arm poised high...a flash of silver...and Casey is struck,
across the chest.
She looks down to see her shirt blossoming
red...a look of bewilderment as she drops to one knee.
The knife rises again...Casey throws her hand forward...the blade
comes down...but it's blocked by the portable phone still in her
hand.
She turns staggering to...
DRIVEWAY
A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE emerge from the parked car.
They move to the
front door completely unaware of what's happening to their
daughter, only feet from them.
FRONT YARD
Casey stumbles forward...her parents ten feet away...she opens her
mouth to scream but no sound resonates...she is beyond
words...staggering, swaying...the FIGURE moving behind her.
FRONT DOOR
Her parents approach the door
FATHER
That fish smelled strong.
MOTHER
I told you to send it back.
The father discovers the front door ajar.
A puzzled look.
Casey
is right behind them with one arm outstretched.
If they'd only
turn around...
They enter the house and close the door as....
Casey collapses on the ground, clutching her bloody chest...the
FIGURE upon her.
FRONT YARD
CLOSE ON Casey...she's dragged by her feet through damp soil...the
life going fast from her body...her hand still clutching the
phone.
FRONT DOOR
The father rushes out the door to find his wife, on her knees,
bent over, retching.
His eyes move beyond to a tree in the front
yard...his stomach fails him...his dinner rises...as he bares
witness to the single, most horrifying sight he'll ever see.
That of his only daughter as she hangs from a big oak
tree...strung up...very much dead...her stomach ripped open.
BLACKOUT!
BEGIN MAIN TITLES
FADE IN:
WINDOW
Sidney sticks her head out the window.
The late night wind hits
her face as a SHADOW appears just to the left of her, a hand
reaches out, grabs her and suddenly a FIGURE is on top of her...
SCHOOL - MORNING
CLOSE ON A SIGN
"BAYBORO HIGH SCHOOL.
HOME OF THE FIGHTING BULLDOGS"
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a picture perfect small town
school.
Old and charming.
Students come and go, moving about.
Nothing unusual, except for the...
six police cars, four news vans, flashing cameras, and crowds and
crowds of lookie-loo's gathered just off campus.
SIDEWALK
Sidney approaches the school seeing the commotion.
Four different
REPORTERS stand in front of four different cameras giving four
different news reports.
She moves passed a policeman standing guard.
Her interest peaked,
she stops at the first reporter who is...
GALE WEATHERS
Thirties.
He smart face is overshadowed by a flashy smile and a
massive mane of chemically enhanced hair.
GALE
(for the camera)
The small town of Bayboro, North Carolina
was devastated last night when two young
teenagers were found brutally butchered.
Authorities have yet to issue a statement
but our sources tell us that no arrest
has been made and the murderer could
strike again...
ON SIDNEY.
Moved, disturbed.
From behind, a finger taps her
shoulder.
She spins around to see...
Tatum Riley, same age, feisty, carefree.
TATUM
Do you believe this shit?
SIDNEY
What happened?
They break away from the crowd and head for school.
TATUM
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker
and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
SIDNEY
No way.
TATUM
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking
splatter movie killed-split open end to
end.
SIDNEY
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in
English.
TATUM
Not anymore. Her parents found her
hanging from a tree. Her insides on the
outside.
SIDNEY
Do they know who did it?
TATUM
Fucking clueless-they're interrogating
the entire school. Teachers, students,
staff, janitors...
SIDNEY
They think it's school-related?
TATUM
They don't know. Dewey said this is
the worst crime they've ever seen.
Even worse than...
(stopping herself)
Well it's bad. They're bringing in the
feds. This is big.
Sidney looks back at Gale, her face deeply pained.
SCHOOL COURTYARD - LATER
Students sit at outdoor tables eating lunch.
Crowded at one table
is the "gang".
This consists of Sidney, Billy and Tatum.
Next to Tatum, sits her boyfriend STUART, with his arm draped
across her back.
He's a Billy wannabe.
Almost the jock, almost
handsome, almost cool.
He tries way to hard.
Across the table is the fifth wheel, RANDY.
A tall and gangly kid
with no such Billy-like aspirations.
A witty jokester who
elevates geek to coolness.
TATUM
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like
to hunt?
STU
I don't know, they just did.
RANDY
Because their bodies were gutted.
Sidney flinches.
BILLY
Thanks Randy.
TATUM
They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.
STU
Because there's no way a girl could have
killed them.
TATUM
That is so sexist. The killer could
easily be female-BASIC INSTINCT.
RANDY
That was an ice pick-not exactly the
same.
STU
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely
hollowed out. Takes a man to do
something like that.
TATUM
Or a man's mentality.
SIDNEY
(quiet, almost to herself)
How do you gut someone?
All eyes turn to Sidney.
A serious silence.
And then:
STU
You take a knife and slit from the groin
to the sternum.
Sidney shivers down to her soul.
The whole table rolls their eyes
at Stu.
STU
What? She asked.
BILLY
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
STU
Sorry.
RANDY
Remember in JAWS when they caught the
wrong shark at first and Richard Dreyfuss
cut it open to look foe body parts and all
they found was a licence plate and all this
white milky goo.
Stu leans over and socks Randy in the arm.
STU
You heard Billy-shut the fuck up.
SIDNEY
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Stu's taken back, a little off guard.
STU
For about two seconds.
RANDY
Before she dumped him foe Steve.
Tatum turns to Stu, surprised.
TATUM
I thought you dumped her for me.
STU
I did. He's full of shit.
RANDY
And are the police aware you dated the
victim?
STU
(offended)
What are you saying? That I killed
her or something?
RANDY
It would certainly improve your high
school Q.
TATUM
Stu was with me last night.
RANDY
Oooooh...before or after he sliced and
diced.
TATUM
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last
night?
RANDY
Working, thank you.
TATUM
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
RANDY
Twice.
STU
I didn't kill anybody.
BILLY
No one's saying you did.
RANDY
Besides-
(perfect Stu mimic)
"Takes a man to do something like that."
STU
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
RANDY
(to Stu)
Did you really put her liver in the
mailbox? I hear they found her liver
in the mailbox.
TATUM
(eyeing Sidney)
Randy, you goon-fuck, I'm eating here.
Stu nibbles at Tatum's neck.
STU
Yeah, Randy, she's getting mad. I think
you better liver alone.
Stu cracks up at his own joke.
The others just MOAN.
Sidney is
about to crawl out of her skin, trying hard to ignore it all.
SIDNEY'S HOUSE - LATER
A huge two story country home with a spacious lawn.
A yellow school bus stops in front of the house and Sidney steps
off.
The house looks big and lonely as Sidney moves up the walk to the
front door.
FRONT YARD - MINUTES LATER
The yard is a whirlwind of activity.
An ambulance, squad cars,
cops everywhere...
CLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE
as it SMASHES against the hood of a police car.
His hands are
being cuffed, his rights being read.
BILLY
(screaming)
I didn't do anything! Sid...where's Sid?
Ask her, she'll tell ya...
Dewey holds a car door open as Sheriff Burke steps out.
DEWEY
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
SHERIFF BURKE
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw..Jesus...
DEWEY
He's her boyfriend.
They approach Billy as he's being placed in a squad car.
BILLY
Sheriff...I didn't do it...please, call
my Dad..please...
The squad car disappears with Billy as another car comes to a stop
in front of the house.
Tatum gets out, freaked beyond belief.
Back to the Sheriff and Dewey as they storm across the yard.
DEWEY
I was first to respond.
SHERIFF BURKE
What were you doing out here?
DEWEY
Drive by patrol.
SHERIFF BURKE
How is she?
DEWEY
She's tough.
SHERIFF BURKE
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Across the yard sits Sidney, in the back of an ambulance as
PARAMEDICS check her out.
Sheriff Burke and Riley approach.
SHERIFF BURKE
We're seeing a lot of you today.
She tries to smile but fails.
DEWEY
You gonna be able to come down to the
station and talk to us a bit?
SIDNEY
..yeah...
TATUM appears, barreling past an OFFICER.
TATUM
What happened? Oh God...
Tatum rushes to her, grabbing hold of her.
DEWEY
(to Tatum)
What are you doing here?
TATUM
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
DEWEY
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an
official crime scene.
SIDNEY
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me
up.
TATUM
Her dad's out of town. She's staying
with us.
DEWEY
Does mom know?
TATUM
Yes, you doofus.
Two news vans come driving up the street.
SHERIFF BURKE
The vultures are coming. Let's get you
out of here.
STREET
A big, white news van comes to a stop in front of the house.
The
side door slides open and Gale Weathers hops out just in time to
see Sidney being escorted to a squad car.
GALE
I'll be damned.
Jumping from the driver's seat is KENNY, Gale's cameraman and
flunky.
An earnest young chap on the chubby side.
KENNY
What? What?
GALE
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
But it's too late.
Sidney is as good as gone.
Gale sees Tatum
moving quickly to her car.
GALE
Excuse me?
Tatum looks up to see Gale Weathers rushing her.
GALE
Was that Sidney Prescott they took away?
TATUM
I don't know.
Tatum hops in her car, ignoring her.
GALE
What happened to her?
TATUM
I'm not talking to you.
Tatum's car peels out as Kenny comes running up with his camera.
KENNY
Where'd she go?
Gale spins around, flashing her pearly whites.
GALE
Look, Kenny, I know you're about fifty
pounds overweight but when I say hurry
please interpret that as...MOVE YOUR
FAT TUB OF LARD ASS NOW!
Gale moves back to the van leaving Kenny miffed.
POLICE STATION - SIDE DOOR
The door opens and Sidney, Tatum, Dewey, and a coupla OFFICERS
exit avoiding the horde of REPORTERS that can be seen around the
corner waiting anxiously at the front entrance.
DEWEY
I'll get the car. Wait here.
Dewey takes off.
From the darkness of the alley, Gale Weathers
appears with Kenny and his camera.
They've been waiting.
GALE
Hello Sidney.
Sidney spins around to see Gale, standing, smiling at her.
Sidney's body tightens and her face goes taut.
GALE
Some night. Are you alright?
Their eyes meet in cold familiar stare.
Sidney says nothing.
She's visibly shaking.
GALE
What happened?
TATUM
She's not answering any questions. Just
leave us alone, okay?
SIDNEY
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her
job. Right, GALE?
GALE
Yes, that's right.
Dewey, in a squad car, turns into the alley and pulls up.
The
other news people have wisened up.
They begin to flock the alley.
SIDNEY
How's the book?
GALE
It'll be out later this year.
Sidney tries to contain herself..squeezing a clenched fist.
SIDNEY
I'll look for it.
GALE
I'll send you a copy.
In a blurred, unexpected instant, Sidney brings her fist forward,
SMASHING it hard into Gale Weathers's face.
The impact sends Gale
reeling backwards, knocking into Kenny as they both tumble to the
pavement.
ON SIDNEY...breathing deep, a sense of satisfaction on her face.
BAYBORO MAIN STREET - DAWN - ESTABLISHING
The morning sun shines high over Bayboro Townsquare.
Cars come to
life, townsfolk stir as the picture postcard community awakens
from a restless sleep.
SCHOOL STREET - LATER
Once again, REPORTERS line the street attacking students as they
make their way to school, asking questions, hungry for that
teenage insight.
Dewey's patrol jeep cruises by.
Sidney watches from the
passenger's window.
NEWSVAN - STREET
Sidney, puts her head down, hiding her face...avoiding other
reporters as she makes her way to...
Gale who sits in the open door, checking her face in a mirror.
Makeup tries hard to hide Sid's handwork-a swollen black and blue
right cheek.
Gale spots Sidney immediately and leaps to her feet.
GALE
Stop right there.
Sidney throws her hands up in surrender.
SIDNEY
I'm not here to fight.
GALE
Just stay back.
SIDNEY
I want to talk to you.
GALE
(calling into the van)
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Kenny's head darts out from the van.
SIDNEY
Off the record. No cameras.
GALE
Forget it.
Sidney contains herself.
SIDNEY
Please. You owe me.
GALE
I owe you shit.
Gale moves inside the van.
But Sidney is relentless.
SIDNEY
You owe my mother.
GALE
Your mother's murder was last year's
hottest court case. Somebody was gonna
write a book about it.
SIDNEY
And it had to be you with all your lies
and bullshit theories.
GALE
What is your problem? You got what you
wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail.
They're gonna gas him. A book is not
gonna change that.
SIDNEY
Do you still think he's innocent?
Gale's interest is peaked.
She eyes Sidney suspiciously.
GALE
He was convicted in a court of law. Your
testimony put him away. It doesn't
matter what I think.
SIDNEY
During the trial, you did all those
stories about me. You called me a liar.
GALE
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
SIDNEY
Have you talked to Cotton?
GALE
Many times.
SIDNEY
Has his story changed?
GALE
Not one word. He admits to having sex
with your mother but that's all.
SIDNEY
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched
him. He raped her, then butchered her.
Her blood was all over his coat.
GALE
He was drunk that night. He left his
coat at your house, after your mother
seduced him...
SIDNEY
I saw him leaving wearing it.
GALE
But couldn't it have been someone else
you saw wearing that coat? The same
person who planted it in Cotton's car,
framing him? The same person who
really killed your mother?
A long beat.
Sidney considers this for the millionth time.
SIDNEY
No, Cotton murdered my mother.
But there's doubt in her voice.
Gale's face lights up.
GALE
You're not so sure anymore, are you?
Sidney clams up.
SIDNEY
No, it was Cotton.
Tatum comes waltzing up.
TATUM
(to GALE)
Nice welt.
Gale ignores her, zeroing in on Sidney, half realizing.
GALE
The killer is still on the loose, isn't
he? These murders are related.
TATUM
Yo--let's rock.
Sidney starts to fidget.
SIDNEY
I'm sorry I mangled your face.
She take off with Tatum.
Gale calls after her.
GALE
Wait, Sidney, don't go...
But Sidney and Tatum have already disappeared in the crowd of
students moving across campus.
Gale looks to Kenny.
GALE
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death
row. A killer still on the loose.
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
KENNY
You want to go live?
Gale's mind races with possibilities.
GALE
No, not so fast. We have nothing
concrete.
KENNY
When did that ever stop you? You can't
sit on this. This is huge.
GALE
If I'm gonna blow this up-I need hard
proof.
KENNY
But it's so much easier when we make it
up.
GALE
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much.
Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
SCHOOL CAMPUS - SECONDS LATER
Tatum and Sidney make their way across campus.
TATUM
Just relax. You're at school now. No
one can get you here.
SIDNEY
But if it wasn't Billy it could be
anybody. He could be here at school
right now.
They move up the walk as a FIGURE falls in step behind them,
sporting a WHITE GHOST MASK.
TATUM
Serial killers are smart by definition.
They minimize their risk. They plan and
pre-calculate everything. Showing up
here would be the most lame-brain
move he could make.
SIDNEY
He promised me he'd be back.
As easy as the figure appeared, it disappears-falling out of site,
unseen by either of them.
TATUM
I wouldn't put too much stock in a
psycho's promise.
They move up the front steps toward the main doors of the school
as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE reappears...standing at the top of the
steps...Sidney sees it first, stopping dead in her tracks.
She steps back, spinning around to find...
A GHOST FACE behind her as well, both of them approaching, closing
in on her.
Sidney starts to SCREAM when the two ghosts bust up
LAUGHING, tearing off across campus.
STREET
In front of the school we catch up a REPORTER doing a live remote.
He holds a mask in his hand.
REPORTER
This morning several students, in what
appears to be a prank, have been spotted
wearing masks. School officials have yet
to comment but this is the same type of
mask worn by the killer...
SCHOOL STREET - MINUTES LATER
Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in front of the school.
He stands
in the open driver's door talking on the radio.
SHERIFF BURKE
(from radio)
She's okay. Looks like some boys were
teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the
school though. I want you to take look
around.
DEWEY
Yes, sir, sheriff.
Dewey shuts the jeep door and heads for campus when Gale Weathers
appears, her fake face aglow.
GALE
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent,
INSIDE STORY.
DEWEY
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the
eye?
GALE
Productive. So they're closing down the
school?
DEWEY
Well..uh...yes ma'am. For the time being.
Dewey heads for the school building. Gale scurries along side him
flirtatiously.
GALE
And why is that? Has something happened?
DEWEY
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
GALE
I know, I should be in New York covering
the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew?
Please, call me Gale. You look awfully
young to be a police officer.
Dewey's eyes wander down to Gale's long legs, the way her hips
move as she walks...he's clearly distracted.
DEWEY
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
GALE
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study
I proved to be most popular amongst
males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course,
you don't look a day over twelve, except
in the upper torso area. Does the force
require that you work out?
Dewey looks away, blushing a bit.
DEWEY
No, ma'am. Because of my boyish good
looks, muscle mass has increased my
acceptance as a serious police officer.
They approach the school's front entrance.
Suddenly, Mr. Himbry's
VOICE in amplified through intercoms across campus via the PA
system.
They stop to listen.
MR. HIMBRY
(via PA)
"Your attention please. Due to the
recent events that have occurred and
until it comes to a resolve--effective
immediately--all classes are suspended
til further notice. The Bayboro Police
Dept. has also asked me to announce a
city wide curfew beginning at 6 o'clock
PM. I repeat..."
Gale speaks over Mr. Himbry's voice.
GALE
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over
a serial killer.
DEWEY
Serial killer is not really accurate,
ma'am. The killer has yet to strike
twice.
GALE
Well, we can hope, can't we? We
certainly don't have any leads. A ghost
mask, a cellular phone--not much there.
DEWEY
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
GALE
Really? You small town guys are good.
And have you located Sidney's father?
DEWEY
No, not yet.
GALE
He's not a suspect, is he?
DEWEY
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Dewey, realizing he's said too much, clams up.
DEWEY
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
GALE
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
DEWEY
That's quite alright. If I may say so,
ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
Dewey starts up the school's front steps as the bell RINGS.
GALE
So you do watch the show?
He turns to her earnestly as STUDENTS come pouring out the front
doors.
DEWEY
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole
year.
GALE
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
She smiles deliciously, gives him a wink, then struts off as
Dewey, like a nervous little school boy watches her go.
TATUM'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON - LATER
The late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing.
Tatum and Sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the
small town neighborhood.
Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in the
driveway.
Despite loud music, BLARING from an inside stereo, this is a quiet
moment.
TATUM
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth.
Maybe he was having an affair with your
mom.
SIDNEY
So you think my mom was a slut too?
TATUM
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know
there were rumors. Your dad was
always out of town on business.
Maybe your mom was a very unhappy
woman.
SIDNEY
If they were having an affair how come
that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
TATUM
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's
a rumor.
SIDNEY
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale
Weathers.
TATUM
(delicately)
It goes further back, Sid. There's been
talk about other men.
SIDNEY
And you believe it?
TATUM
Well...you can only hear that Richard
Gere-gerbil story so many times before
you have to start believing it.
A long silence as Sidney agonizes over all of this.
She stands up
and moves to the edge of the porch and stares out onto the
neighborhood.
SIDNEY
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still
out there.
TATUM
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to
sound like some Wes Carpenter flick.
Don't freak yourself out--we've got a
long night ahead of us.
SIDNEY
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore
me.
TATUM
Come on, let's rock.
Sid follows Tatum inside the house never seeing the GHOST MASKED
FIGURE that stands across the street, under a tree.
His presence
so subtle and unobtrusive you'd have to see this movie a second
time to know he was there all along.
MAIN STREET - LATER
Stu is moving along main street when Billy comes barreling up next
to him.
BILLY
How'd you do?
STU
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
BILLY
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
STU
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
BILLY
Duh...that's quick.
STU
I was just asking. Why are you always at
me?
BILLY
Because I'm trying to build your self-
esteem. You're far too sensitive.
STU
Oh....
Billy thumbs Stu's forehead.
BILLY
You ready to party hard tonight?
STU
You know it.
They come to a building centrally located in the heart of Main
Street.
A huge, blue monstrosity that's bigger than the local
bank and post office combined. The sign in front reads
BLOCKBUSTER.
MAIN STREET - LITTLE LATER
Dewey's patrol jeep makes it's way down mainstreet.
It's almost
dark.
The street is close to deserted.
PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS
They pile out of the jeep.
Dewey heads for the station.
DEWEY
I'll just be a few minutes. Don't go
far.
The girls take off for the local supermarket that sits across the
street.
SIDNEY
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
TATUM
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his
mouth shut. I think we can live without
EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for
one night.
They approach the grocery store.
Small and simple.
Sid and Tatum
grab a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store, pushing the
cart through two sliding glass doors.
A lone CHECKOUT LADY behind the counter, big and frumpy, looks up
from counting money.
CHECK OUT LADY
You girls gonna have to hurry it up.
We're under curfew.
TATUM
Two minutes tops.
They make a bee-line for the junk food section just as the
automated doors slide shut behind them and a...
GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears, out of nowhere, standing just
outside, watching, quietly through the glass store windows.
POLICE STATION - SHERIFF'S OFFICE
Sheriff Burke's face heats up as Deputy Riley marches in,
hurriedly.
SHERIFF BURKE
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
DEWEY
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
SHERIFF BURKE
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real
bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls
were listed to Neil Prescott--Sidney's
father. He made the calls with his cellular
phone. It's confirmed.
DEWEY
Couldn't his cellular number have been
cloned?
SHERIFF BURKE
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is?
The anniversary of his wife's death. It all
fits. He's our man.
DEWEY
Have you contacted the bureau?
SHERIFF BURKE
They believe he's out of state by now.
We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in
effect through the night. If he's not
picked up by morning--we'll do a house
to house.
DEWEY
You think he could still be in town?
SHERIFF BURKE
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
DEWEY
She's with my sister. Should I bring her
in?
SHERIFF BURKE
Hold off for now. Just stay close to
her.
DEWEY
She'll be with her friends over at Stu
Maker's tonight.
SHERIFF BURKE
Watch her. Don't let on--just keep your
eyes out.
DEWEY
Yes, sir.
SUPERMARKET
Sid pushes the cart out of the glass door with Tatum riding it.
The GHOST MASKED FIGURE is nowhere to be found.
SIDNEY
What do you think about when you're
having sex?
TATUM
With Stu, there's little time to stop and
reflect. But sometimes before, to relax
and get in the mood, I think about Grant
Goodeve.
Sid pushes the cart and Tatum across the street.
SIDNEY
Who?
TATUM
Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on
EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He
was the one who lived off alone. He would come
around every now and then with his guitar and
sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."
He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot
brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I
was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show
came on every day after school right during my
puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental
in my maturing as a woman.
SIDNEY
How does that get you in the mood with
Stu?
TATUM
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to
myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives
with love..." It's a real turn on.
SIDNEY
No way.
TATUM
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm
convinced the lyrics had a secret
meaning, "Eight is enough..."
Sid pushes the cart up to Dewey's jeep.
Tatum hops off.
SIDNEY
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical
thing?
TATUM
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is
bigger than the one you're pushing.
SIDNEY
TATUM!
TATUM
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits
til he's dead but the minute you mention
an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
Sidney stops just short of a laugh.
Tatum pulls the back jeep
door, loading the groceries in.
Behind her, the GHOST MASKED
FIGURE appears, just out of their sight, behind the jeep's open
back door.
TATUM
There's that sense of humor. I knew it
still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some
fun tonight.
SIDNEY
Deal.
Sidney moves to the back door and closes it shut, when from
behind...
DEWEY stands.
Sid jumps, startled.
DEWEY
You girls ready.
SIDNEY
Yeah.
DEWEY
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard
tonight, Sid.
TATUM
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
DEWEY
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the
way, I promise.
TATUM
Shit.
Tatum kicks the shopping cart out of the way, blindly.
It rolls
down the road by itself, gaining speed on a decline running smack
into the GHOST MASKED FIGURE who stops the cart cold with one
hand.
COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
Dewey's jeep makes it's way down a long, winding road.
Headlights
illuminate the thick woods that line each side.
Following behind
them at a discreet distance is a huge white newsvan.
Dewey comes to the end of the road.
It dead ends at...
STU'S HOUSE which sits alone in a clearing, big and ominous with
no neighbors in sight.
A huge old home just ripe for a night of
fun and...terror.
From the looks of things the party has already started.
Music is
BLARING. A few KIDS hang on the porch.
STU'S HOUSE - ROAD
The newsvan pulls up and parks unobtrusively on the side of the
road a few feet down from the front yard.
GARAGE DOOR
Tatum is half in/half out of the pet door.
She BEATS and JERKS
wildly, unable to see the FIGURE on the other side...
A true fighter, Tatum kicks hard, making direct contact with the
FIGURE, knocking him away.
She takes the moment to pull herself through further...but she
stops...stuck.
She pulls and tugs but can't move.
She listens
but hears nothing.
Where did he go?
An agonizing silence.
And
then...
CRR-BRRRM!
The garage door is activated.
It begins to rise
upward, taking
Tatum with it.
She SCREAMS MADLY.
TATUM
NOOOOOOOO.....
Tatum's arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free
herself from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up...
She looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage
rafters just as her neck hits the first beam, SNAPPING instantly.
ROAD - CONTINUOUS
Gale heads for Dewey's patrol jeep.
DEWEY
Actually, I thought we could walk. It's
not far.
Gale appears skeptical, but smiles anyway.
She's genuinely
smitten by this young guy.
DARK ROAD - CONTINUOUS
A long, deserted country road.
In the distance, a single
flashlight beams ahead, the only light in the black night.
Gale
and Dewey can be heard.
GALE
So is Dewey your real name?
DEWEY
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck
with a long time ago.
GALE
I like it. It's... sexy.
DEWEY
Nah... it's just this town's way of not
taking me serious.
GALE
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a
meteorologist...
CLOSE ON Gale and Dewey, walking closely, side by side-
flirtatiously.
Gale is surprisingly nervous.
GALE
People treat me like the Antichrist of
television journalism.
DEWEY
I don't think you're so bad.
Gale smiles.
GALE
Are all the local boys as sweet as you?
Dewey blushes.
He starts to say something when headlights appear
behind them.
They both spin as TWO CARS loaded with KIDS come
racing right at them.
Dewey grabs Gale and pushes her off the road... just as the cars
speed by, oblivious to them.
IN THE DITCH
Gale lands face up with Dewey right on top of her.
He steals a
glance in her eyes before rolling off her.
DEWEY
You okay?
Something takes Gale's attention.
GALE
What's that?
Dewey looks to where gale points.
He finds the flashlight and
aims it into the bush.
The tail end of a car is just visible.
DEWEY
Looks like a car.
Dewey helps her up and they move to it.
He shines the flashlight
on the plates but it's already obvious to the CAMERA.
This is the
same car we last saw Sidney's father driving away in.
DEWEY
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
GALE
Sidney's father?
DEWEY
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here.
What the fuck is he doing here?
Dewey is panicked.
He grabs Gale and they race off down the road.
FRONT YARD
Gale and Dewey come running up the drive, frantic.
DEWEY
I'll call for backup.
GALE
I'll get my camera.
They split up.
The CAMERA FOLLOWS GALE as she rushes to the
newsvan, throwing open the door.
GALE
Kenny! Camera! Quick!
The van is empty.
GALE
Kenny?
A CAR HORN goes off.
Gale spins around.
It came from the patrol
jeep in the driveway.
GALE
(calling out)
Dewey?
She moves across the yard to the jeep, the door hangs open...Dewey
is nowhere to be found.
GALE
Dewey? Where are you?
A look of pure dread comes over Gale.
FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
Gale, hanging tough, approaches the front door, unable to hear
Sidney's SCREAMS three floors up.
Gale reaches for the door just
as she hears LOUD, HORRIBLE SHRIEKS from just inside.
She backs
away.
FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS
Gale races across the yard putting distance between her and the
house.
She moves back to the van...
SIDE OF THE HOUSE
Sidney wastes no time.
She looks for Gale, SCREAMING, but Gale is
gone.
Sid lowers herself down the ledge, sliding down a sloped portion
of the roof onto...
THE MASTER'S BEDROOM BALCONY.
Then she eases herself over the railing and lowers herself,
letting herself hang as low as she can...then she lets go, free-
falling the rest of the way...but in a split instant...
THE GHOST APPEARS
grabbing her wrists in midair.
Her body hangs, dangling against the side of the house.
The GHOST
begins to lift her, pulling her back onto the balcony.
Sidney jerks, pulls, twists...but the HANDS have her, hoisting her
up...Sidney SCREAMS MADLY...yanking one last time, freeing
herself.
SHE DROPS TO THE GROUND, a good seven feet, landing on her back,
hitting hard.
She grabs at a pained leg and brings herself
upright.
ROAD - CONTINUOUS
Sidney races to where the van lay on it's side.
Sidney peers
through the windshield...Gale's body lay limp and bloody.
SIDNEY CRIES OUT, turning, limping to the driveway.
She sees the
patrol jeep with it's open door...she goes for it.
FRONT OF JEEP
ANGLE through front windshield.
Sidney RANTING into the police
band.
She doesn't see the...
GHOST FIGURE open the tailgate door of the jeep and slowly crawl
in behind her.
The GHOST FIGURE reaches out and grabs hold of Sidney's neck.
Sidney, with surprising strength, spins around and attacks the
GHOST.
She falls back against the dash, legs out, kicking wildly at him.
Her hand reaches for the door, finds the lock, the door lever, she
pulls...
The door swings open...
Sidney falls out of the door, hitting the ground.
FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS
Sidney, on her stomach, squirms away from the jeep.
She brings
herself up to her hands and knees, looking behind her to see
nothing...
THE GHOST HAS DISAPPEARED.
Sidney's eyes roam the yard but he's nowhere.
Completely gone.
Vanished.
Sid crawls to the front porch where...
DEWEY'S BODY LAY
Thinking quickly, precisely, she reaches to Dewey's holster and
grabs his gun when a VOICE ECHO'S behind her...
VOICE
(o.c.)
Sidney!
She turns to see Randy racing to her, limping.
He appears stone
cold sober.
RANDY
Jesus, Sid. We gotta get out of here.
Sidney throws the gun forward.
SIDNEY
Stop. Right there.
RANDY
Don't shoot. It's me.
SIDNEY
Don't come any closer.
RANDY
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's
dead, she's been killed...I think Stu did
it.
He takes a step forward when another VOICE SPEAKS UP.
VOICE
(o.c.)
Don't believe him, Sid.
Sidney spins around to see Stu moving up the walk.
STU
He's lying. He killed Tatum. And Billy.
Stu moves closer to Sidney.
SIDNEY
Stay away.
She aims the gun in his direction.
STU
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid.
He's gone psycho.
RANDY
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the
one.
Sidney has lost it, she doesn't know who to trust.
She aims the
gun at Stu..then Randy..then Stu...
STU
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
RANDY
No, Sid.
They both move toward her.
There's no time.
She must act now.
Finally...
SIDNEY
Fuck you both.
And with that, Sidney steps back into the house and SLAMS the
front door shut.
