CHYRON:  SAMMY S ELECTRONIX, MIDTOWN SOUTH 

POLICE TAPE blocks off an electronics store, whose windows 
have been SMASHED.  We hear JAKE start to talk intensely...

JAKE (V.O.)
This job is eating me alive.  I can't 
breathe anymore.


A castle-like building on a busy New York street.

TERRY (V.O.)
(quietly)
All right.  Let s get started.


A typical loft style New York apartment building.


Jake and Amy break for coffee.

JAKE
Well, I hate to say  I told you so,  but 
the new C.O. is proving to be exactly he 
kind of stickler ass-face I told you he 
would be.  I m done knocking on doors.

AMY
Hey, as my grandpa used to say:  cuando 
escuche el grito de la ubre, la leche de 
la vaca.   When you hear the udder 
scream, milk the cow.
(off his look)
It means, you follow orders or else.  

JAKE
Your grandpa sounds like a fun guy.

He tosses away his coffee cup.

JAKE (CONT D)
(thinks)
What about that ham?  That seems 
interesting.  Let s look into that.  

AMY
No.  The C.O. gave us a direct order.  
But you go ahead if you want.  It ll give 
me a head start on solving this puppy.

JAKE
You wish.  Oh, and here...in case you see 
oxygen tank man again.

He tosses her a condom and heads off.

AMY
I m not unattracted to him!  And he 
wasn t married, so technically I won the 
bet!


Terry, Amy, and Jake.  The room overflows with files.

JAKE
So, this is the records room.  I 
literally didn t know this room existed.

TERRY
I come in here to lift weights when I get 
tense.  I wish I could get assigned here 
full time like you.  
(lovingly)
You could not be farther from the action.

AMY
(gleeful)
Gonna be hard to solve more cases then me 
when you re stuck in here.
(giggles)
This could not have worked out better.  
For me.

JAKE
Morales has merely proved my theory that 
he s a blowhard with a stick up his butt.  
Guy has no idea how to be a real cop.

TERRY
Wrong, dummy.
(instantly)
I m sorry, that was mean.  Truth is, 
Morales has forgotten more about being a 
cop than you ll ever know.  In the 70 s, 
he caught the Disco Strangler.

AMY
He caught the disco strangler?


 as back Ratko s from hangs off, head his screaming Charles,
he turns in fast circles.  Jake points his gun at Ratko.

JAKE
Ratko!  Put Charles down and get on your 
knees, or else I m going to --

Amy comes from out of nowhere and takes Ratko down with a 
blow to the back of his knee.  Meghan cuffs him.

JAKE (CONT D)
Oh come on!  I wanted to put the cuffs 
on.  That s the fun part.

BACK TO SCENE

TERRY
Hoo boy.  So glad I was not there.

MORALES
I think you would ve handled things just 
fine.

Terry smiles weakly.

(CONT D) MORALES
I d like to say something.  Every cop is 
different.  Every precinct is different.  
But I run the hundred and ninety-first, 
now, and I m going to run things my way.  
You want to work for me?  You grind it.  
Get cases, work cases, solve cases.  The 
right way.  
(raises a glass)
To the detectives of the 191st precinct.

JAKE
And to Captain Morales.... s Best 
detective, Jake Peralta.

CHARLESEVERYONE ELSE
Here here.Booo!

Morales looks at Jake, who raises his glass.  Morales smiles, 
slightly, and we PULL BACK and

Jake at the board, next to the  JP/AS  Chart.

JAKE
Sure... you  cuffed him,  but I solved 
the case.  It goes in my column.

AMY
Fine.  I ll give you...three-fourths and 
I get one-fourth.  
(she adds .75 to his number)
And I just picked up a dunker -- gonna 
polish it off in an hour.  I m on your 
heels, JP.

CHARLES
What did you guys bet on this?  Tell me.

AMY
Don t worry about it.  

Morales walks in -- Jake hands him some papers.

JAKE
Finished my report, Captain.  But... why 
read it when you can hear it?

 Grind  and  Bump -- MACHINE KARAOKE the on play presses He
starts playing again.

MORALES
There s no karaoke in my precinct.
