A fishing boat pushes over choppy water. FOUR GUN TOTING
MEN on Jet Skis wearing black wet suits and goggles
escort the boat. Flying above it is a HELICOPTER.
The JET SKIER in the lead weighs in on a radio.
The camera descends as the boat passes, and dives beneath
the surface.
The droning of engines becomes less pronounced. Foam
from the boat and skis bubbles.
Calm. Then from out of nowhere five NAVY SEALs wearing RE-
BREATHERS appear, in neat formation like the Blue Angels.
JET PROPELLED BACKPACKS push the SEALs through the water.
The LEAD SEAL: SHANE WOLFE, points upwards. All eyes
follow his finger to the underbelly of the boat above.
From his belt, Shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive
disc attached, aims it at the fleeing boat and FIRES.
A cable shoots up -- THUD... The disc sticks to the
boat's hull. Shane pushes a button on the wand retracting
the cable and drawing himself closer.
Dangling from the cruiser, Shane fixes a BOMB to the
hull. He releases himself from the boat and speeds away --
2.
BOOM. A dense explosion sends ripples through the water
and ELECTRICITY crackling around the boat.
Shane slips inside the hull, through the new hole.
The jet skiers protectively circle the injured boat in a
SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING move, and the Jet Ski drivers are
simultaneously YANKED below the surface: a split second
later they're replaced by our SEALS (ALSO IN BLACK WET
SUITS AND GOGGLES) -- the switch happens in less than a
second, way too fast for anyone to notice.
Serb 1 rushes out, shouting orders: He alerts four ARMED
GUARDS and the Jet Ski drivers (now our Seals).
SERBIAN 1
Something must be below us! Shoot! Shoot!
The Armed Guards fire relentlessly into the water. Serb 2
rushes below deck.
4.
The Armed Guards stop shooting into the water. One of
our SEALS calls out to them, in PERFECT SERBIAN:
SEAL
KEEP SHOOTING!
The Guards fire again. The SEAL speaks into his neck mic.
SEAL (CONT'D)
Give it a second, they're almost out of
ammo.
The Seal calls out: "shoot more, more!" They do, until
there's nothing but empty CLICKS from their guns.
SEAL (CONT'D)
Now Lieutenant. Chopper's four meters at
your 10 o'clock.
Shane and the Professor rise to the surface as the boat
falters behind them. Shane pulls out a retractable
CROSSBOW. It clicks open and he shoots a CABLE into the
belly of the helicopter above him.
SHANE
Hold on.
A Pave Hawk SH-60 helicopter, rotors whirling slowly,
waits. Shane's chopper appears from behind a tree line
and sets down atop the mountain by a stream.
Shane and Charles sprint from the chopper towards the
waiting Hawk. Charles stops Shane.
CHARLES
Lieutenant, thank you. (He pats his
briefcase) You saved more than just my
life today. Can I call my wife to let
her know I'm okay?
SHANE
Negative. Not imperative to the mission.
We have to keep moving. I have strict
orders to get you out of here safely.
CHARLES
I'm safe, Lieutenant. Please. She thinks
I'm dead. (then) Don't you have a family?
6.
SHANE
(this gets him:)
Make it quick.
Charles picks up his briefcase. He holds the lock up to
his mouth and whispers into it:
CHARLES
Joe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.
The briefcase pops open. Shane looks at him, puzzled.
CHARLES (CONT'D)
My kids. It's voice activated. Designed
it myself. I do security, that's my
specialty. (gestures back:) Those guys
back there tried to get this case open
for five days -- couldn't crack it. And
you should see what happens to you if
open it without the code. I have a
picture of my kids in here, you want to
see it?
SHANE
Negative.
Charles takes a cell-phone out of the case. Shane looks
in the case: it's EMPTY, except for the phone and a
family PHOTO. Charles dials his cell phone... nothing
CHARLES
Battery's dead...
Shane considers, then hands him his satellite phone.
Charles dials, and talks...
CHARLES (CONT'D)
Honey, I'm alive...
The helicopter is on fire. Wolf lies facedown in the
stream. He looks around, barely conscious.
SHANE'S P.O.V.: Everything is a blur, in slow-motion. He
sees Charles, unconscious. A Huey Helicopter lands. A
VERY TALL MAN steps out, and takes Charles' Briefcase.
There is huge explosion, as the chopper ignites.
Everything is ablaze. Shane reaches out, grabs the
picture of Charles' kids then goes unconscious.
F
ADE TO BLACK:
EST. HOSPITAL - DAY
TITLE CARD: 1 Month Later
A taxi door opens. Shane looks like a bad ass, ready for
anything. He steps from the taxi onto an adorable TROLL
doll on the sidewalk. It SQUEAKS.
Shane's P.O.V.: Julie's unkempt suburban house, with toys
all over the lawn, and a "BLESS THIS MESS" welcome mat.
Shane double-checks the address. The sprinklers go off.
Shane darts to the door and rings the bell (it's one of
those long cheerful doorbells).
WE hear TINY FEET approach -- then the door swings open,
Shane looks down -- and sees LULU, 8, peering up at him.
Shane eyes Lulu. Lulu eyes Shane, then:
LULU
Mom! There's some weird bald guy at the
door!
SLAM. Lulu shuts the door in Shane's face. Shane frowns.
WE hear heavier footsteps approaching.
EMALE VOICE (o.s.)
(before she sees Shane:)
Look, if you're with the Hare Krishnas,
we're not interested...
The door opens revealing JULIE PLUMMER. Julie holds
NAKED baby PETER, 2. She sees Shane, and stops, a little
startled by his size...
SHANE
(salutes:)
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, reporting for
duty.
JULIE
Of course. I'm so sorry.
Thank you for
coming.
She hugs him. He's not quite sure what to do -- he's a
rock, he doesn't flinch.
JULIE (CONT'D)
Come in and meet the rest of the gang.
The yard is littered with toys. In the middle is a
TRAMPOLINE. He spots the Figure climbing the TRELLIS.
Shane runs, jumps onto the trampoline. He flies in the
air and latches onto the figure. They both tumble to the
ground.
Shane yanks off the DARK FIGURE's hood, revealing SCOTT
(16) a nervous teenager. He's dazed, but alright, wearing
SHARPER IMAGE night vision goggles.
SCOTT
... Zoe?
Zoe runs out the door, setting off the PIERCING ALARM.
ZOE
He's my boyfriend, tool.
SHANE
So you're the one who broke in.
Zoe -- go back inside.
ZOE
Okay, fine... come on Scott.
Shane grabs Scott by the scruff of the neck.
SHANE
Not with this kid. (to Todd:) You --
Gimme twenty!
Freaked, Scott fumbles for his wallet and gives Shane a
twenty dollar BILL.
SHANE (CONT'D)
I meant PUSH-UPS!
Befuddled, Scott starts to
do lame push-ups. Shane grabs
the back of Scott's shirt,
LIFTING him in the air,
spinning him away from the
house like a marionette. Scott
runs off, calling out from
across the street.
S
COTT
... I'll call you, Zoe!
Zoe storms inside. Shane stands there, fuming. The
Alarm's still blaring. The window of the house next door
opens: a Korean couple, THE CHUNS, pop their heads out.
They're arguing with each other in Korean. Shane
addresses them, IN PERFECT KOREAN with subtitles:
S
S
17.
SHANE
My apologies. We had an intruder. A
simple misunderstanding.
MR. CHUN
(perfect English, no accent)
We speak English, Kojak.
SHANE
Oh. Sorry.
MRS. CHUN
... Look, about the 2000 decibel alarm
and the kleig lights and stuff... we own
a bakery, so we're up kind of early.
Would you mind?
SHANE
Sorry.
Shane pulls a remote control from his pocket and clicks
it. The alarm stops.
MR. CHUN
Thanks a bunch. Oh, and we found this in
our pool filter... Try to keep that zoo
reigned in, huh baby-sitter?
Mr. Chun tosses him the TROLL DOLL and slam their window
shut. Shane's about to head inside, he pulls a tiny
camera phone from his pocket, and snaps a shot of the
Chun's car in their driveway.
I
The sun rises over the neighborhood, warm orange light.
Establishing.
Shane chases Helga to the cab.
SHANE
Red Leader! I command you to come back!
That is a direct order! You can't leave
a man behind!!
Helga jumps in the cab.
SHANE (CONT'D)
(SCREAMING)
I don't know the Peter Panda song!!
As the cab pulls away, in the rear window, Helga glares
back, then does an obscene Romanian hand gesture.
ANGLE - SHANE
His jaw drops in disbelief. He drops his head, defeated.
Then -- he slowly glances up.
ACROSS THE STREET
The Korean couple is staring at him, dumbfounded.
KOREAN WOMAN
Don't worry, if she loves you, she'll
come back.
ANGLE - SHANE
Rises, takes a deep breath and strides inside.
The car speeds out of the drive, backwards at sixty
m.p.h.. It does a skidding 180 and heads down the street.
A big suburban school, Busses and PARENTS are parked at
the curb, STUDENTS of all ages are hurrying inside. The
Minivan skids completely sideways, into a TINY parking
spot -- a death defying, perfect parallel park.
Shane, dead serious, (Tyler in Snuggle) is riding the see-
saw in the school's playground. Peter rides on the other
side with a group of KIDS, to balance Shane. Shane types
on his laptop: CLAIRE NELSON. A picture of Claire in a
Naval uniform pops up as well as her stats...
SHANE
Clean as a whistle.
Shane closes the computer, picks up a pair of binoculars.
BINOCULARS P.O.V. as Shane goes from window to window of
the school: Zoe is glaring at him through the window from
her seat in a class. Todd, sitting in the back row of a
class, yanks his hood over his head. Lulu waves from 2nd
Grade, delighted.
Along line of FIRST GRADERS wait for the seesaw.
SHANE (CONT'D)
Back off. Official Business.
36.
ON THE PLAYGROUND:
Shane stands with his Baby snuggle. Peter is running in
circles around him on his harness, like a tether ball. He
checks his tracking device...
Shane dives into the Minivan. The DOTS on the tracker are
headed North. He speeds away after them.
The BLINKING DOTS on his tracker are side by side, racing
down the road ahead of Shane. They make a sharp right.
Shane makes a right, almost tipping the minivan. He
blasts through a red light.
41.
He turns a corner -- a PLYWOOD WALL surrounds the site.
He leaps out of the minivan. He looks at the tracker: Zoe
and Todd are dead ahead, through the fence.
Two BIG CONSTRUCTION workers are standing on the other
side of the plywood wall -- Shane KICKS out one entire
section, and charges through.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
What hell do you think you're doing?
He turns around, to see several CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, all
brandishing tools.
SHANE
Tell me where the kids are and I'll let
you all live!
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Buddy, you're about to get a beat down.
Three Workers rush him. Shane easily takes them out. The
remaining Workers give Shane a scared look -- then RUN.
ANGLE - SHANE
He's alone. He catches his breath, then checks his
tracker. Todd and Zoe's BEEPS are coming from a MANHOLE.
Shane pries off the manhole cover.
He looks down.
IN THE MANHOLE - It's dark and dank.
No sweat. Shane lowers himself down.
Shane Loads the brownies and toddlers into the minivan.
As the minivan pulls out of the driveway, the camera
CRANES up to...
ZOE'S WINDOW:
Inside, Zoe picks up the phone, hits speed-dial.
ZOE
.. he's got us on lock-down, it's like
Oz or something. No, not munchkin Oz --
HBO Oz. (she listens:) Hm... I dunno if
that's a good idea, Scott...
Shane pulls the minivan into the crowded parking lot --
the Brownies are all singing 99 Bottles of Beer on the
Wall at the top of their lungs.
Shane (double-Snuggled) helps the Brownies set up a card
table to display their cookies.
SHANE
I gotta get supplies. I can see you
through the window, but if anything
happens...
LULU
(flashing her bracelet)
I know.
The Brownies are trying to sell the cookies, but they're
very shy. SHOPPERS blow passed them without even noticing
them. One of the Brownies spots something...
46.
BROWNIE
Oh no... they're back.
SLOW MOTION: In a shot out of Reservoir Dogs, we see who
she means: A group of bad ass, chubby CUB SCOUTS. They're
headed straight towards the cookie table, menacingly.
UGLY CUB SCOUT
(to another Scout)
Hey Skeever, what's stinky and floats
`til you flush `em?
2ND SCOUT
Brownies?
The Scouts cackle. The Ugly Scout yanks a box of cookies
away from Lulu. He rips it open, dumping the cookies on
the ground and grinding Uthem with his foot.
UGLY CUB SCOUT
This is Troop 16 territory. How are we
supposed to sell raffle tickets when this
place reeks of your skanky cookies?
2ND SCOUT
BEAT IT, before I get my face punching
badge on you.
The Brownies take off running, clutching their boxes. One
of the Scouts grabs Lulu -- she tugs and tugs, but can't
get away. Finally, the Cub Scout takes her SCARF. He
laughs, and lets her go. The Cub Scouts high-five.
Shane heads to the Brownie's table -- but Lulu and the
Brownies are gone. In their place are the Chubby Scouts.
SHANE
Where are my troops?
UGLY CUB SCOUT
... I haven't seen anybody, you Skeever?
2ND SCOUT
Nope. You wanna buy a raffle ticket?
We're trying to win .22's.
Around his neck, Shane's monitor starts beeping. Shane
takes off running in the direction of the signal.
47.
Shane runs up to the minivan. The Brownies are huddled
behind it, trembling.
SHANE
What happened? (No one answers) Well?
LULU
Those boys over there broke our cookies.
Shane eyes the Cub Scouts. Dead serious:
SHANE
Well then -- I'm afraid I have to
eliminate them. If I don't come back --
avenge my death.
He heads toward the Scouts. The Brownies scream.
BROWNIES
No!
Shane stops. He bends down, and points at Lulu's Panic
button. He firmly tells Lulu, who's close to tears:
SHANE
This is not a toy. I'm here to protect
you. Not cookies. Get in the car, we're
going home.
BROWNIE
You can't take us home yet, you're
supposed to take us to dinner.
SHANE
Where?
Shane (Tyler in Snuggle), loads Brownies into the
minivan, counting them. Barking at them like Marines:
SHANE
Move, move, move! Go go!
Shane drives, the Brownies are singing 99 Bottles...
again. Suddenly, a look of horror comes across Shane's
face... he spins the minivan in a 180 and floors it.
Shane is exhausted, as he pulls up in the Minivan. He
gets out -- and groans in disbelief. It's insanity: HIP
HOP blasts, gyrating TEENAGERS everywhere, chugging
drinks, making out, peeing in the bushes, jocks throwing
footballs.
Reeling, Shane takes Lulu, Peter and Tyler up the path.
He protectively guides them past the craziness -- until a
football suddenly WHIZZES by. Outraged, Shane snatches
it mid-air -- then CRUSHES the ball. POP!
hane gives a blood-curdling stare.
SHANE
Party's over.
The jocks flinch, scared, then RUN.
Shane unlocks the
CLUB lock off the door.
Two DARK CLAD FIGURES watch, through binoculars. They see
Shane find the CD, and walk out of sight.
54.
A long line of exhausted party-goers files out. Scott's
the last one to leave.
Early morning, students run in to school. The minivan
pulls up, and Shane emerges with the five kids.
SHANE
I gotta warn you guys: From now on, I'm
gonna be sticking even closer.
Driver's Ed. An obstacle course with cones. Zoe
nervously drives a small sedan, a crazed TEACHER next to
her. He is gesticulating, SCREAMING, reacting each time
she HITS the gas, then BRAKES, HITS the gas, then BRAKES.
Shane stands off to the side, shaking his head.
Peter
and Tyler are tight in their Snuggles.
60.
The minivan pulls up, with Shane and all the Plummers
piled in. Shane parks, Todd runs towards the house. Shane
holds Todd back by the arm.
SHANE
Wait Todd, I want to talk to you...
odd yanks his arm away and runs into the house.
Shane, on the girl-bike, pedals after the bus. A few
HOMEBOYS watch him pass, curiously. He nods back, tough.
The bus stops in a rundown neighborhood Todd hops off the
bus. Shane's arrives a moment later, dripping sweat. He
stashes the bike behind a mailbox...
Shane'S P.O.V.: At the entrance to the old warehouse,
Todd meets up with three other TEENAGE BOYS, they're
dressed in brown HITLER YOUTH UNIFORMS, they head inside.
Shane follows them, stealthily.
As Mr. Chun gets his paper, Shane, (Tyler in the
snuggle), hands out bag lunches as the Kids load into the
minivan. Shane turns and catches Mr. Chun, staring.
SHANE
What are you looking at?
Zoe pulls to the curb, almost tapping a bus's rear
fender. Shane unclenches his teeth.
SHANE
Good. Next lesson, 1500 hours.
Zoe smiles. And the other Kids all bolt from the car,
terrified. Lulu makes a big show of kissing the ground.
ZOE
Ha ha ha. Very funny.
T
hey head into the school.
Shane spots something.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals: SCOTT (Zoe's boyfriend), with a
few FRIENDS, laughing, being obnoxious. Shane jumps out
of the car. Before Scott knows what's happened, Shane's
LIFTED him in the air by his backpack. Scott's terrified.
SHANE
I know 437 ways to hurt a man without
touching him. Broken promises lead to
broken legs. Do we understand each other?
Scott nods, trembling. Shane lets him down and heads into
school.
Shane marches the Brownies through a FOREST.
He wears
Peter and Tyler in front and rear Snuggles.
SHANE
If you're ever lost in the woods, the
first thing you have to do is find a
source of drinking water! And make sure
it's potable. If you're not sure, boil
it for thirty minutes!
The girls are loving it, fascinated.
SHANE (CONT'D)
You have to eat, right? Well let me tell
you you're not gonna find Girl Scout
cookies out here.
LULU
We're Brownies.
SHANE
No brownies
either. A lot of roots are
edible. So
is some tree bark. When I
HALO'd into
Rwanda, I lived off the
underground
fern stem for three weeks!
Shane kicks over a ROCK.
Underneath are crawling BUGS.
SHANE (CONT'D)
Insects. They look nasty but they're full
of nutrients that may save your life.
76.
He scoops up some bugs and EATS them.
BROWNIE
He's eating Roly-Polies!
The Brownies are frozen in shock.
SHANE
(mouth full of bugs:)
Wots of pwotien!
E
UPBEAT MUSIC kicks in over the following MONTAGE:
Shane leads the Brownie Troop through Combat exercises.
In unison, the Girls PUNCH, KICK. PUNCH, PUNCH, KICK.
Shane's got Tyler's cradle next to him, in between
punches, in perfect tempo, he reaches out and rocks it.
The Duck watches all this -- fascinated.
The lot is empty. Shane and Zoe sit in the minivan, Shane
holds a stopwatch. He signals her, she burns rubber, and
races through a slalom of orange cones -- she hits EVERY
ONE -- the wheel hubs are CLOGGED with cones. She skids
to a stop just short of the "Severe Tire Damage" spikes.
Zoe leaps into the minivan through the windows. Zoe peels
out and weaves the cones...

she only clips one, it teeters, but doesn't fall. Shane
gives her a signal, she throws it in reverse and drives
the course backwards.
Lulu, in
her BROWNIE uniform, ties a complicated knot --
we WIDEN
to see she's tying Shane's hands behind his
back, as
the Brownie troop watches. He counts "1,2,3..."
and then
begins wriggling free. They watch closely.
Shane and Zoe are huddled under the minivan's dashboard.
Shane's showing her the IGNITION WIRES.
Shane has the Brownies assembled. He's attached SOFA
CUSHIONS to himself. The Brownies attack, mercilessly.
The Brownies sit at their cookie table beside the door.
Across the lot, the Chubby Cub Scouts, at their own
table, see them. The Scouts head towards the Brownies.
U
GLY CUB SCOUT
Hey Skeever, what's in a Girl Scout's
pants when she has diarrhea?
2ND SCOUT
Brown...
He stops short, the Brownies have moved into a FORMATION,
ready to strike, Lulu at the front: it's (kind of) scary.
LULU
Go away and we won't hurt you.
The Scouts share a look -- they LAUGH. The head Scout
steps forward and grabs Lulu's cookies. In one move, she
spins out of the way and pulls off his neckerchief.
GLY CUB SCOUT
Gimme that!
He grabs the neckerchief, but like lightning, she wraps
it around his arm, tying him. She shoves a cookie in his
mouth.
79.
LULU
Uh oh. You're gonna have to pay for that.
The Scout struggles, the Other Scouts are scared.
UGLY CUB SCOUT
Let go! Let go -- MOMMY!
She lets him go -- in a FLIP, he lands on the ground
hard. Lulu lets out another "kia!" The Girls move
forward in unison, striking a cool pose.
The Cub Scouts have all been tied with their own bandanas
to the CART CORRAL. Shane comes out of the store, and
catches Lulu, using his "catchphrase."
LULU
From now on, you do things our way -- no
highway option!
The Scouts nod, terrified. Shane gives her a stern look,
then LAUGHS.
Zoe sits on the railing, she seems sad. Shane approaches.
ZOE
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna jump.
SHANE
What's wrong... Scott?
ZOE
o. Scott's fine. I don't know what you
did, but he's really straightened up.
Flowers, phone calls. ...I've never been
in love like this before.
Shane nods.
SHANE
How long you been together?
ZOE
A month...
SHANE
That's longer than any relationship I've
ever had.
ZOE
You're okay, Shane. I'm not used to
anyone giving me the benefit of the
doubt. My teachers don't trust me. Mom
doesn't. My dad didn't care about us, he
was never here...
Z

81.
SHANE
(interrupts her, stern:)
Hey. Your father cared about you very
deeply. He told me you were the greatest
things in his life. That what's bothering
you? Cause -- we can talk about it, if
you want.
Zoe's eye well up, then she cries. Shane holds her.
ZOE
I miss him so much...
Shane is a little taken by surprise. Then -- he decides
to answer. He takes his Sfather's MEDAL out of his pocket.
SHANE
This was my dad's. He was the only family
I ever had. Mom left when I was little,
cause dad was always gone. Two years
in... an indisclosable locale. Another
six in... Another indisclosable locale. I
didn't really have a home, so I went to
military school -- then one day my mom
got the letter. No more dad.
He looks at the Medal.
SHANE (CONT'D)
I always wanted to be just like him. I'm
starting to realize, I never really knew
him. I don't know if I'm like him or not.
ZOE
That's horrible, Shane.
SHANE
The hardest part was living without any
details...why? How? Where? I always
wondered if he thought about me.
OE
Me too.
So how did you get through it?
SHANE
You could say I just shut down my
emotions. I turned off all feelings and
dedicated myself to becoming the perfect
soldier.
OE
I never even got to say good bye.
J
82.
A tear runs down Zoe's face. She throws her arms around
Shane. The phone rings. Shane answers it.
INTERCUT WITH:
J
The house is dark. Shane sits in a lawn chair, scoping
the area with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES ON. Gary sits in the
next chair. Shane sighs morosely.
SHANE
Just another assignment. No reason for
personal attachments.
Shane takes a sip out of a juice box. He pets the Duck.

Hey Gary, your wings aren't clipped. How

hane rises.
We pan up from the WHITE "US GOV" license plates to Bill
at the wheel. Julie sits beside him. Bill's cell phone
rings, he answers it.
SHANE
Sir! Excellent news. I think I found
GHOST.
Bill reacts, excited.
BILL
... Do you have it?
SHANE
No. It's in a steel vault. I've been
trying all night, can't crack it, sir.
ILL
(remaining calm)
Good! Good work. Okay, don't do
anything further. We'll be there shortly
-- don't do anything `til I get there.
BACK TO:
Bill's Sedan pulls up.
Julie and Bill hop out.
The family comes scrambling out -- but as Julie exits, a
HAND suddenly GRABS her.
JULIE
AGGGH!
She SCREAMS. Bill lurches into view, clutching her! The
kids are horrified. They start to run back, but she
urgently gestures --
JULIE (CONT'D)
Keep going!
RUN! Go GET HELP!!!
The kids fret, unsure, then nod and run to the side
garage. Zoe and Todd load the kids into the minivan.
ZOE/TODD
Hurry!
C'mon! Buckle up!!
r. Chun comes racing around the house -- as SCREEEECH!
The van suddenly FLOORS out, almost clipping him!

MR. CHUN
ARGHH!
Chun falls, as the van PEELS backwards down the driveway,
and 360's. RRRR! It shifts into drive and ROARS away.
Chun hops into Bill's car and races after them.
The vehicles race, Chun just inches from the kids' tail.
He tries to pass them on the right. It's like a chariot
race, Chun zooming by, half on the sidewalk, to cut them
off!
The Minivan blasts through another yellow.
LULU
Look out Zoe! Rollers!
There is a POLICE CAR cruising the street ahead of them.
Zoe blows past it. Inside is the Cute Cop. The Squad
Car's lights flash on, and he catches up with the minivan
-- it takes a while, they're FLYING.
ZOE
Come on. Use the gas, not the brake, 5-0.
Zoe slows down so the Police Car can pull up beside her.
The Cute Cop shouts over at Zoe.
97.
CUTE COP
I'd say you could lose your license --
but you haven't got one!
ZOE
People are trying to kill us. They have
my mom, and our bodyguard -- you have to
follow me!
CUTE COP
Just pull over!
ZOE
Fine. Don't follow me!
She swerves into the Squad Car, almost running it off the
road. Zoe U-turns, and speeds back towards her house. The
Squad Car turns around and chases her.
The Minivan speeds by. The Squad Car is on its tail. It
is joined by MORE SQUAD CARS. Following the chase, at a
safe distance, is Mr. Chun in his now-wrecked sedan.
Murney and Claire are watching a SOCCER GAME.
He's in a
NECK-BRACE.
MURNEY
That Baloney Bandit struck again. I
accept full responsibility. My
intelligence proved to be faulty, but if
I had more resources...
She shakes her head, Suddenly, the Minivan SPEEDS by.
VROOOOM! Then the Police Car CHASES by. VROOOM!! Then --
FIVE MORE POLICE CARS ZOOM BY. VROOOOOOM!!!
MURNEY (CONT'D)
(not that surprised:)
I told you not to pass her in Driver's
Ed.
Claire frowns, concerned...
The minivan races toward the house.
The Police Cars
chase after, SIRENS wailing.
IN THE VAN, everyone is SCREAMING.
101.
TODD
Zoe! You're going too fast!! You're not
gonna have enough time to stop-
ZOE
Hey, I'M the one in Driver's Ed!
I think
I know what I'm doing!!
WIDE
She squeals into the driveway, then BRAKES.
But it's too late. The van SKIDS, smoke BURNING from the
tires -- and hits a tree. The Kid spill out and run.
The lead Police Car screeches to a stop.
POLICE leap
from the car.
Total commotion. The kids clamber from the van, with
their hands raised. Cops surround them. Even Peter and
Tyler have their little hands over their heads.
The
garage door raises, Shane steps out.
SHANE
Whoa, WHOA!
What are you doing to these
kids??
CUTE COP
FREEZE. HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.
102.
Cops cover Shane and Julie, Julie and Shane Freeze.
ZOE
But, officer...
CUTE COP
I said FREEZE. Zoe, you're in a lot of
trouble... Reckless endangerment!
Driving without a license. Numerous,
uh... trafficS violations --
SHANE
(cutting him off)
These kids are heroes. They just aided
in exposing a high-level espionage ring.
I suggest you call the FBI. Now.
Silence. The Cops are unsure what to do. He scoffs.
CUTE COP
You expect me to believe any of that?
Suddenly -- a CRAZED SCREAM.
MR. CHUN (O.S.)
EVERYBODY!
HIT THE GROUND!!!
WIDE
Everyone spins. Mr. Chun stands inside the gate,
pointing a ROCKET LAUNCHER. He's disheveled and manic.
MR. CHUN (CONT'D)
I WANT THE GHOST, TEN MILLION DOLLARS,
AND A DIRECT FLIGHT TO PYONGYANG!
The cops freeze, helpless. Shane weighs his not so many
options... Nobody is sure what to do.
But then -- a WOMAN suddenly flips over the fence, vaults
onto Chun, and KNOCKS him out with a Karate Chop.
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
Ya!!
Claire lands on her feet, triumphant. Even Chun is
amazed, as he turns his head, Shane spins, and grabs the
rocket launcher.
CLOSE-UP - SHANE
He breaks into a big grin.
103.
CLOSE-UP - CLAIRE
She proudly smiles back at him.
ANGLE - THE CUTE COP
He's flummoxed. This chaos is unsolvable.
Beaten, he
reaches for his radio.
COP
I think I'll call the FBI.
DISSOLVE TO:
F.B.I. AGENTS swarm the area. Bill and the Chuns are
being hauled away in cuffs. Julie huddles with the kids.
Shane talks with an F.B.I. Agent.
F
.B.I. AGENT
Mr. Wolfe... that was nice work.
You're
a one-man battalion.
SHANE
Just doing my job.
F.B.I. AGENT
The Bureau is always looking for good
men. Do you have a card or something?
The Agent hands him a BUSINESS CARD, then walks off.
Shane examines it, swelling with pride.
Claire walks up to Shane. Mock-angry.
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
So. What happens now? You'll be stationed
somewhere else, right? I guess there's no
more reason for you to stick around here.
Shane looks at her. He looks around: at the family. He
looks at Claire....
SHANE
Well. I'm kinda, re-conning the
situation, here... And to tell the truth.
I don't see anything but reasons to stay.
P
RINCIPAL CLAIRE
So... What's the next move?
Shane smiles slyly and pulls her close.
SHANE
... I don't know. I'm on dry land. You're
the superior office. You tell me.
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
Well. Summer's almost here. What if you
and me did a little amphibious recon
mission. On, say -- Maui?
SHANE
Sir yes sir.
Claire beams. The Plummers all approach, interrupting.
Zoe gives them a look -- that makes Shane and Claire
BLUSH. Lulu turns to Shane, sad.
LULU
This is it. Your work here is through.
Guess you have to go now...
105.
She puts out her hand, to shake his.
SHANE
Ah, come here you.
He surprises her with a BEAR HUG -- he hugs the whole
family at once, squeezing them off the ground. He puts
them down. Before he goes: he reaches down and gives Zoe -
- his medal. He squeezes her hand around it.
ZOE
But...
SHANE
He would've wanted me to give it to
someone I care about. Like he did. Thank
you. For everything.
P
ETER
Love you, Shane.
TIGHT - SHANE
This is too much.
He wipes his face.
SHANE
Your dad would be so proud.
Shane bawls -- he can't keep it in. He starts to head
off, Lulu calls after him:
LULU
Shane, we're never gonna see you again!
SHANE
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna
see you Friday night.
A long beat.
Julie looks up, baffled.
JULIE
What's Friday night?
